## Setting: 

The air shimmered with heat rising off the asphalt, clinging to the back of Thomas' throat like sweat. A brutal sun beat down on Highway 89, baking the earth beneath his worn boots and making even the gravel grit itself seem to burn. This stretch of road stretched endlessly, a ribbon of concrete slicing through the heart of Nevada’s desert, punctuated by dust devils twisting in the distance. The wind whistled past Thomas' bandana as he surveyed the freshly-painted white line – an invisible boundary between his job and the unforgiving expanse beyond.  

## Character: 

**Thomas "Tommy" Callahan** wasn't always a highway worker. He once dreamt of mountains, not mile markers. But life had a way of shifting gears. After losing his father at a young age and watching his younger brother spiral into a life of petty crime, Tommy found solace in the familiar rhythm of construction work – the hard, honest labor that kept them both afloat. 

He wasn't alone on this stretch of desert highway; he was just another cog in the colossal machine of progress, yet every day felt like he was carving out his own small corner of the world with each freshly laid concrete slab.


**Story Opening:**

Tommy adjusted his battered hardhat and wiped the sweat off his brow. He glanced at the faded sunrise reflected in his steel-blue eyes, a familiar image of hope that lingered against the bleak backdrop of the desert dawn. "Another day," he muttered to himself, kicking a loose rock with the worn leather boot. It was a daily mantra, a silent prayer for another paycheck and another chance to build something tangible in this lonely place. A new signpost, maybe, or a longer span over that infamous washout.  But as Tommy surveyed the empty road stretching before him, an unsettling unease began to prickle at his skin. Something felt off. 

His gaze fell on a glint of metallic green amongst the dusty brown earth. It pulsed faintly in the rising sun, like a heartbeat beneath the surface. He squinted and pushed aside his doubts, pushing forward towards the anomaly.  Something whispered from the depths of the desert, a hushed urgency urging him to investigate.
