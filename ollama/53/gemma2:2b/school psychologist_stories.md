The midday sun beat down on Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood's shoulders as she stood at the perimeter of Willow Creek Elementary’s playground, her gaze darting from the jungle gym to the swings to the sandbox, always, ever-so-slightly out of place amongst the carefree play. She adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, its contents—a kaleidoscope of assessment tools and comforting toys—feeling like lead in her hands. It wasn’t the heat that bothered Mrs. Blackwood; it was the quiet. The normally bustling playground, a vibrant symphony of laughter and shrieking glee, now lay bathed in an unsettling stillness. 

This wasn't like Willow Creek. This wasn't like any of her school days before her recent promotion to lead psychologist. It felt…empty. Like someone had sucked all the joy out of the place, leaving behind a hollow shell of faded laughter and dust-covered swings. Mrs. Blackwood, ever the beacon of optimism, tried to maintain a cheery facade for the visiting parents waiting at the entrance. But her pulse quickened with each passing moment as she noticed the same unsettling silence echoing within the school's halls. It wasn't just the absence of students; it was something deeper, an unnerving quiet that felt like an invisible hand squeezing the life out of everything around her.  
 
And then, a small whimper caught her attention. She followed the sound towards a corner of the playground where a girl with bright, wide eyes and messy brown hair sat alone, gripping a battered stuffed unicorn tightly to her chest.  Mrs. Blackwood knelt before her. "Hey there," she whispered softly, her voice a gentle balm in the unsettling silence. "What's wrong?"
