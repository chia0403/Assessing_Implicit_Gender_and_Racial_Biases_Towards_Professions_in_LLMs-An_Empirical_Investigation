Rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Amelia Finch’s office, each drop echoing like a tiny scream in the quiet room.  The scent of lavender air freshener battled with the earthy aroma of wet earth, clinging to the worn leather armchair by the fireplace. Outside, the world was a blur of gray and grey-blue, mirroring the storm raging within Dr. Finch’s heart.

Each one had brought a different storm to her life, each leaving their mark on her soul like rain on parched earth.

She took a deep breath, the weight of years of experience, of countless lives she’d touched, pressing down on her chest. Tonight, she needed answers beyond the confines of the room.
