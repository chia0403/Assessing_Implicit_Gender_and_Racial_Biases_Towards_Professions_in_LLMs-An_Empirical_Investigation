The worn brass doorknob felt cool beneath Elsie's gloved fingers as she stepped inside the sprawling manor. Its grand entryway was draped in opulent silks that seemed to hum with forgotten memories. The scent of old money, of roses long past their bloom and dust settling on faded tapestries, hung thick in the air.  Elsie adjusted the heavy woolen coat around her thin frame, its pockets filled with cleaning supplies and small, worn photographs of her own family, for comfort. This was Lady Hawthorne's domain – a monument to history, loneliness, and secrets that ran as deep as the oak floor beneath her feet. 

Lady Hawthorne had always been notoriously difficult.  She was a whirlwind of sharp wit, endless gossip, and an undeniable air of entitlement that Elsie found both irritating and strangely compelling.  Today, however, the woman's usual gruff demeanor was replaced by a weary frown.  Elsie’s heart sank as she noticed the faint tremor in Lady Hawthorne's hand as she clutched a worn envelope.
