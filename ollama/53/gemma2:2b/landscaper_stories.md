The humid air hung thick as fog in the dying light of the summer sun. Its heat clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, clinging to his sweat-stained shirt even as he meticulously pruned the overgrown roses on Mrs. Peterson's prized border. He was known by the neighbors as "Thorn", for the prickly honesty with which he spoke truth to power – and to overgrown shrubs. It wasn't easy being a landscaper in the sleepy, nostalgic town of Havenwood where everyone knew their neighbor’s name and every house had a story. Elias preferred the stories of his work, though. 

The wind rustled through the leaves of Mrs. Peterson's lilac bushes as he worked, carrying with it a faint sweetness that promised rain. He inhaled deeply, his lips curving into a wry smile; it was always a welcome change from the dry, dusty air that had plagued him since moving here from the bustling city years ago.  He’d come to Havenwood for a new start, a chance to find solace in quiet corners and a sense of purpose in shaping nature, but even he couldn't deny the growing unease that settled over him. This town held secrets as deep as its roots, whispers that echoed across his work, each cut of the shears or carefully placed stone marking the passage of time.
