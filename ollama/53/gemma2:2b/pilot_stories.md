The amber sun bled across the horizon, painting the vast expanse of the Nevada desert in hues of fiery orange and fading red. The air hung heavy, thick with humidity and a metallic tang that clung to Amelia “Ace” Carter’s weathered skin as she shifted in her cockpit. Her calloused thumbs traced the worn leather of the control yoke, her brow furrowed as she peered through the windshield at the skeletal remains of an abandoned mining town. 

This was it – her chance for redemption. Ace had never wanted this kind of life, not after the incident that had cost her everything: a reckless gamble with a rogue air force jet, a fiery crash landing, and a life-shattering public trial for manslaughter. Now, she flew cargo routes between Arizona and New Mexico, ferrying supplies to remote communities while battling the demons of guilt in the silence of the vast emptiness above. 

"Three o'clock, Ace." The voice on her radio crackled with a familiar baritone. It was Frank, her mechanic and friend. He knew her story better than she did, had seen the fire that still burned beneath her steel-grey eyes, the same fire that had driven her to take flight when her world went up in flames.
