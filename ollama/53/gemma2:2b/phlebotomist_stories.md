The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting sterile white stripes across the waiting room.  The air hung thick with anxiety and the scent of disinfectant.  This was Evelyn Thorne’s domain, but lately it had been feeling less like a sanctuary and more like an asylum.  Evelyn, known for her gentle touch and calming presence, was finding herself battling not only the usual suspects – agoraphobics, cancer patients, and those seeking bloodwork with a distinct lack of self-control during their yearly “Wellness Check”– but also the ever-growing dread that accompanied each new face she saw.  This was all compounded by the rumors circulating in the office – whispers about a strange illness plaguing a group of nurses at the neighboring hospital.

Her current patient, Mr. Henderson, sat across from her on the examination table with his chin tucked and his eyes darting nervously around the room. Evelyn's hands were already deftly preparing for the procedure – her scalpel felt cool against her palm as she remembered the way it was designed to slide through skin like butter under a warm knife's caress, only this time, she couldn’t shake off an unsettling feeling that even this mundane task held an inherent danger. 

**Setting:**  A modest medical clinic in a bustling suburb of Chicago. The year is 1963.


**Main Character:** Evelyn Thorne (a phlebotomist with a quiet demeanor and a heart that felt heavier than usual).
