The floor-to-ceiling windows of his office offered a panorama of the glittering city; glass and steel reflecting the harsh December sunlight.  Inside, however, Ethan Thorne felt like he was drowning in a sea of spreadsheets, each line a reminder of the crushing weight on his shoulders. He ran a calloused thumb over the worn leather of his briefcase, its familiar texture offering little comfort as he stared at the red numbers flickering on his computer screen. 

Ethan was a stockbroker, one of the youngest partners at Thorne & Company, and lately, even the company's name felt like a cruel joke. The market had been volatile for months, a maelstrom of panic and fear that seemed to be sucking the life out of everything, including his once-bright future.  He was supposed to be on top of the world - married to the beautiful Sarah, a child expected soon, but lately, even the prospect of fatherhood felt like a distant echo in a vast, empty room.

The only thing that offered any solace was the aroma of fresh coffee wafting from his trusty, chipped mug; an old ritual he clung to as if it were life itself. Outside, the city hummed with a different kind of energy - one fueled by Christmas lights and carols, but Ethan felt only the weight of time ticking away on his watch, each second a hammer blow against his hopes.  This was a game rigged from the start, and tonight, he wasn't sure if he had the will to play.
