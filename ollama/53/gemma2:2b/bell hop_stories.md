The air in the Grand Astoria was thick with champagne-scented smoke and anticipation. A lone saxophone wailed its bluesy lament from the grand lobbyâ€™s corner, its mournful notes somehow blending into the symphony of rustling silk and hushed whispers. This was the night Evelyn "Evie" Davenport, bell hop extraordinaire, was determined to make her mark. For tonight, she wasn't just another face flitting between suitcases and polishing floors in the bustling heart of Manhattan. Tonight, Evie was a magician, a maestro of lost luggage and forgotten memories. 

She was stationed at the foot of the towering grand staircase, waiting for the latest arrival to whisk away into the opulent depths of this luxurious hotel. A flurry of footsteps echoed down the grand hallway as her eyes caught sight of him - tall, with a sharp jawline, and his coat collar pulled high against the winter chill. His name was Julian Sterling: a millionaire playboy whose presence promised more than just another night's stay in the Grand Astoria.
