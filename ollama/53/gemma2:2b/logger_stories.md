The smell of pine and wet earth clung to Thomas "Thor" Anderson like a second skin. For years, it had been his lifeblood - every breath, every ache in his back, every scar on his calloused hands traced the stories of a life spent under the towering pines of the Northwind Forest.  He was Thor, King of the Logs and Master of the Mill, a legend whispered amongst the younger loggers with eyes that shone with envy. The forest floor here was treacherous, dotted with fallen trees and uneven ground, but Thor moved like he belonged there – heavy boots sinking into the damp earth with practiced ease as his axe sang through the bark of an ancient pine. 

The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple as Thor surveyed his latest haul.  Two massive logs lay stacked, ready for transport. But something was different this evening. An unsettling silence had settled over the forest, a weight heavier than any load he'd ever hauled. And a chilling wind whispered secrets Thor couldn’t decipher.
