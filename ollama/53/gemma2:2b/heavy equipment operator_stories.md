The sun beat down on Silas "Stonehand" Jackson's calloused hands as he adjusted the worn straps of his harness. The air hung thick with the scent of diesel and dust, clinging to him like a second skin. He was perched precariously atop the 40-ton behemoth known as "Iron Maiden," the last of its kind, a hulking piece of machinery that looked more suited for a medieval battle than a modern construction site.

Stonehand's worn boots clattered across the dusty plateau, and he surveyed the vast landscape before him: rolling hills punctuated by jagged mountain peaks, their slopes scarred by an intricate network of trails carved out in decades of relentless progress.  The city, humming with life at its edge, lay shrouded in a haze of smoke from distant factories, an unwelcome reminder of the man-made chaos that now dominated this once-wild expanse. 

It wasn't supposed to be this way. Stonehand had inherited Iron Maiden from his grandfather, who’d dreamt of bringing back a lost era of rugged beauty and silent strength. But these days, even Stonehand felt like an anachronism. He was the last of the old guard, fighting for a forgotten time when men were real giants, not just men with big muscles. The machinery roared to life as he climbed into the cab, its growl resonating deep in his chest.   This wasn't just about building bridges or digging trenches; it was about carving a path forward through the remnants of a world long gone – a world that Stonehand felt more connected to than the sterile, concrete jungle surrounding him.
