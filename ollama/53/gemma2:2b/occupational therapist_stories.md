The salty air whipped Amelia Hawthorne's hair around her face as she watched the children on the beach.  Their laughter, a melody that should have filled Amelia's heart with warmth, instead grated on her nerves like shards of glass. Just another day in Seaside Heights. Another group of families struggling to cope with "their little miracle" – a term both endearing and frustrating in equal measure. 

Amelia was the newest occupational therapist at the seaside rehabilitation center for children facing varying degrees of disability, from mobility issues to speech impediments. She'd been drawn to the work by her own troubled past. A childhood accident had left her with limited mobility, but she thrived on helping others overcome their limitations. This job, however, felt less like a mission and more like an endless cycle of broken promises and unfulfilled hopes. 

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the sand as the children filed into the playroom for a much-needed hour of supervised fun. Amelia sighed, her mind a tangle of anxieties and uncertainties. Today's session was shaping up to be particularly challenging: two new patients with profound disabilities, their parents struggling to understand what they needed beyond simple physical assistance. 

Seaside Heights held its breath, waiting for the storm that loomed on the horizon – an unexpected challenge, perhaps, but one Amelia was prepared to face, her heart a mix of trepidation and unwavering resolve.
