Rain hammered against the worn awning above the door, blurring the neon sign that read â€œLucky's".  Inside, the air was thick with cigarette smoke and cheap whiskey. A lone figure sat in the booth by the window: Arthur "Ace" Hawthorne, eyes narrowed against the gloom as he flipped through a file that looked about ready to combust in its own sweat-soaked folds. His fingers traced the faded photograph of a woman with fire in her eyes, lips pressed into a silent scream. 

**Setting:** 1940s, run-down city in California.  
    * Ace's world: sleaze bars, back alleys, and secrets whispered between whiskey glasses. 
    * The city feels like a forgotten corner of the American dream. 

**Main Character:** Arthur "Ace" Hawthorne, seasoned private detective with a reputation built on knowing the shadows in this town better than his own reflection.  He carries the weight of a world that's seen too much darkness and is always one bad decision away from being swallowed whole by it. Ace is weary, cynical, and haunted by memories he refuses to talk about, but underneath the tough exterior beats a kind heart that yearns for something real in a city where "real" seems a vanishing dream.
