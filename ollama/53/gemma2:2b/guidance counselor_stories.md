## The Bridge Builder

**Setting:**  Northgate High School - A sprawling brick structure with peeling paint on the outside and faded lockers overflowing with student anxieties within. It's 1986, and Northgate sits in a small town nestled amongst rolling hills, where gossip travels faster than the morning air, and the weight of expectations hangs heavy on every teenager's shoulders.

**Character:**  Ms. Evelyn Blackwood -  A woman who once thought guidance counseling was just about handing out college brochures and filling out application forms. Now, she sees the teens as miniature architects, each one with a bridge to build between their ambitions and reality. Her office is her safe space; a haven of worn leather chairs, stacks of books taller than teenage dreams, and the comforting scent of old paper and cinnamon.

Ms. Blackwood was staring out the window when she saw him.  He stood awkwardly by the doorway, his face hidden behind a thick, tangled mess of hair and an oversized bookbag that seemed to contain every possible emotion in its depths. He was just another student trying to navigate the tumultuous waters of high school, but Ms. Blackwood had seen it all before - the awkward first-year struggles, the whispered dreams and unspoken fears, the relentless pressure to find their way. 

She leaned back in her chair, a familiar weight settling onto her chest.  She was ready to begin the journey with another bridge builder.
