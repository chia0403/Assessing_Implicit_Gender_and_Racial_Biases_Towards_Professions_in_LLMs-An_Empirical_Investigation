The sterile air of St. Jude's hospital was thick with unspoken fears and hushed anxieties.  Even in the bustling heart of emergency, where life hung on a thread, Amelia Thorne felt adrift. She had been a Registered Nurse at St. Jude's for five years now, each year etching another layer of weariness onto her face. The last few months had been particularly brutal – a wave of critical patients, a dwindling supply of nurses, and the mounting pressure from a new management system that felt more like an iron fist than a guiding hand. 

Amelia knelt beside the bed of Mrs. Henderson, a frail woman who was clinging to life after a heart attack.  Mrs. Henderson's face, gaunt and pale, reflected the same quiet fear that Amelia herself carried within her heart, but for different reasons.  The fluorescent lights hummed above their heads, casting long, unsettling shadows on the worn linoleum floor.   She adjusted Mrs. Henderson's IV drip with a practised hand, the rhythmic click of the syringe a silent symphony in the hushed room. 

Outside, the city pulsed with life, but within these walls, everything felt frozen in time.  It was a battlefield, where every inch yielded an agonizing battle against death. Amelia was at war – not just with disease and pain, but also with a feeling of isolation that was growing all too familiar.
