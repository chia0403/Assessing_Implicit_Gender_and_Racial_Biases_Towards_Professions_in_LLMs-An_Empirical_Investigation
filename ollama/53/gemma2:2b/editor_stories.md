Rain lashed against the library windows, mimicking the frantic rhythm pounding in Eleanor Vance's chest.  The scent of old paper and leather mingled with something acrid, like burnt cinnamon and regret. Around her, stacks of bound manuscripts towered like concrete monoliths, each one a potential world waiting to be explored. But tonight, Eleanor wasn’t searching for the next great American novel; she was hunting for a ghost story. 

She'd inherited her grandfather's failing publishing house, "Blackbird Press," after his death last month. The building itself was a testament to its former glory – grand oak doors and heavy mahogany shelves. But now, dust clung to everything like forgotten memories, and the once-vibrant energy seemed to have fizzled away. 

Eleanor shifted her weight from one foot to the other, the worn rug beneath her feet offering scant comfort against the unease gnawing at her gut. The deadline for submission of her grandfather’s latest manuscript loomed closer by the hour, and she was desperate for some kind of spark - something that would pull the old stories back into focus.  Tonight, it felt like all she had were shadows and whispers, a silent plea from beyond the grave.
