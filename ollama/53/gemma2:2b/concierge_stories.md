Rain lashed against the windows of The Astorian Hotel, each drop echoing like tiny claps on the grand mahogany frame. Inside, Estelle Blackwood, otherwise known as "Estelle" by the hotel staff, polished a brass doorknob with practiced ease. Her worn black dress clung to her slender frame as she surveyed the lobby, the bustling chaos of an autumn afternoon providing an unwelcome distraction from the quiet hum of the antique clock on the mantlepiece.

The Astorian was no stranger to luxury; its opulent decor and discreet clientele were a testament to that fact. But Estelle knew the true charm lay in the unseen corners, in the stories hidden behind each polished surface, each creaky floorboard. She had been concierge here for thirty years, long enough to know the ins and outs of the building's heart, to understand the pulse of its lifeblood â€“ the people who walked through its doors.

Tonight was a special night. The renowned art collector, Mr. Thorne, was arriving for his annual exhibition. He was as enigmatic as his collection: a symphony of wealth, power, and unspoken secrets that Estelle had long admired from afar. Tonight, she would have a front-row seat to the drama that awaited them all.
