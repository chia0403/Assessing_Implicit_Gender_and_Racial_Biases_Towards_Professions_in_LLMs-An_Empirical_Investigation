The late afternoon sun streamed through the dusty windows of Willow Creek Florist, painting vibrant patches onto the floral arrangements sprawled across the counter.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne meticulously trimmed a cascade of blue hydrangeas, their delicate petals whispering promises of spring's return. The scent of roses and lilies mingled with the earthy aroma of old wood and freshly cut grass, a familiar symphony that calmed Amy as she moved through her life’s routine.

The small town nestled against the foothills was steeped in quiet routines; people knew each other by their first names, gossip flowed like the creek nearby, and time seemed to hold its breath between each passing season.  Yet, for Amy, Willow Creek felt suffocatingly ordinary.  Her shop, inherited from her grandmother after a life-changing storm swept through the town years ago, was more than just a business; it was a monument to faded dreams, a tangible reminder of all she’d lost and could never reclaim. 

Today, however, felt different. A new scent, sharp and almost metallic, clung to the air in the shop—a strange aroma that made Amy pause her work. Was it the wind carrying the scent of distant rain?  Or something…else?
