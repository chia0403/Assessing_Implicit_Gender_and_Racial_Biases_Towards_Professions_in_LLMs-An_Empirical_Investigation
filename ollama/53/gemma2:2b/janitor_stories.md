The fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Thorne's head as he scrubbed the linoleum floor in the cramped office wing of the Grand Blackwood Library.  A symphony of whispers, rustling pages, and distant snores drifted from the vast stacks, punctuated by the occasional cough or stifled giggle from a hushed group studying Shakespeare. This was Elias's own personal soundtrack â€“ an orchestra of knowledge that played out behind the grime-filled walls of this once-grand but now neglected institution. 

His worn rubber gloves felt stiff against his calloused fingertips as he scrubbed another section of floor, a sigh escaping him.  For over a decade, he'd been Elias Thorne: the janitor who kept the whispers alive in the hushed halls of Blackwood, unseen and unheard. Yet, today, something was different. A strange quiet hung in the air, the usual hum punctuated by an unsettling stillness. The whispers were replaced by heavy breaths, quick shuffling steps, and the click-clack of boots on polished marble. 

As he finished his sweep, Elias caught a glimpse of the door to the main library hall.  A young woman stood there, her face framed by a cascade of dark curls, holding a battered leather-bound book. It was then that he saw the glint in her eyes, like a reflection of the moon's cold light - and knew his routine wouldn't be enough.
