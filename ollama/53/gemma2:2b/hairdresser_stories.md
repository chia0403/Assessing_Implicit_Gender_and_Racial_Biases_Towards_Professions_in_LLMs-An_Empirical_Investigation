The worn ceramic sink in Amelia's salon hummed softly with the lingering scent of lavender shampoo.  Sunlight streamed through dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air like tiny fallen stars. The usual symphony of hair dryers and clippers was replaced by the gentle patter of rain against her old roof tiles. Outside, a storm raged. Inside, Amelia sat amongst the chaos of a cancelled appointment, waiting for the deluge to pass and a possible phone call from the salon owner. 

Her hands itched to pick up the shears she usually kept tucked neatly in a pouch by her elbow, but instead, her fingers played idly with the loose strands of her auburn braid. Amelia's mind was adrift. Her once-bright spirit seemed dulled, as if a single raindrop had fallen into an already overflowing well of despair. The storm mirrored the tumult within her: a wave of grief that threatened to engulf her at any moment. Three years ago, she'd lost her husband, Daniel, and the world continued spinning on its axis, but his absence was a permanent fixture in her life.
