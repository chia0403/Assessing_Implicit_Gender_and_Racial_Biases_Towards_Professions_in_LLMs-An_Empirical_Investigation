## Story Opening:

The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia's worn scarf around her face as she stood at the precipice of the cliffside. The sun was dipping below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and dying embers - a scene she could forever be drawn to. Here, on this desolate stretch of coastline facing the tumultuous Atlantic, she painted with reckless abandon.  It wasn’t just the crashing waves against the jagged rocks that inspired her; it was the raw, untamed spirit of the sea itself that poured onto canvas, reflected in every stroke of her brush. 

Amelia Thorne was a painter known for her bold strokes and evocative canvases. Her art spoke not simply of beauty but of the soul's struggle with the relentless passage of time, the yearning for something beyond reach, and the quiet desperation hidden within human desire. She had lost herself in this world of swirling paint and crashing waves, losing track of anything else for years.

**Setting:** 

A desolate cliffside overlooking a churning, stormy ocean. The town of Dunhaven sits nestled amongst the cliffs, its streets paved with cobblestones and lit by gaslight lamps, creating an almost surreal feel in contrast to the harshness of the surrounding sea. The air is thick with salt and fog, a constant presence that clings to Amelia like a second skin as she paints on her easel amidst the wind’s relentless roar.
