The fluorescent hum of 30th Street Station was almost enough to drown out the cacophony inside Michael "Mick" O'Brien's head.  It was another Saturday morning in Chicago, but for Mick, it wasn't just about his usual breakfast and newspaper fix at the diner across the street. He had a call to make – not to Mrs. Henderson about her faulty smoke detector again (she wouldn't get the joke) or about the endless "repairs" of her aging Victorian home. This was personal. 

This job wasn’t just an electrician's assignment; it was a lifeline, one he hadn’t been able to afford since his wife’s diagnosis last year. A glimmer of steel in the dim light reflected off the worn leather of his toolbox, as if taunting him with the weight of promises. This station, this line connecting Chicago's pulse with its underground heart, was where his family could find their freedom again – and it all started with a faulty cable he'd need to repair.
 
Setting: A bustling late-night train station in Chicago. The year is 2023.
