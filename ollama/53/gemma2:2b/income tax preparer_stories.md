The fluorescent hum of the office lights buzzed in Evelyn Reed's ears as she meticulously sorted through stacks of tax forms. The smell of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, clinging to the worn leather of her desk chair like a familiar ghost. It was April, and with every pile she tackled, she felt the ever-present weight of deadline pressure building like a storm cloud over the small office nestled on the outskirts of Willow Creek. 

Evelyn was no stranger to chaos; after all, she'd spent years as an income tax preparer, navigating the intricate web of loopholes and deductions with practiced ease. But this year, something felt different. The usual knotting tension in her stomach had morphed into a palpable unease, like a shadow lurking just beyond the flickering lamplight. It began with the unusually high number of clients, each with stories as rich and tangled as the forms they brought in.  It started small - a single mother struggling to navigate a tax code that felt more hostile than helpful - and then escalated into a flurry of claims about unreported income, suspiciously large deductions, and whispers of an unusual case from a notorious corporate lawyer. 

Evelyn's heart was a drum solo against her ribs; she couldn't quite shake the feeling that something was amiss.  Was this just another whirlwind spring season? Or was there something else brewing beneath the surface of Willow Creek, waiting to erupt like a dormant volcano?
