The scent of antiseptic clung to the air like a phantom limb, a constant reminder of Dr. Eleanor Blackwood's career. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in the stark white walls of the clinic, mimicking a silent orchestra playing a symphony of worry and resignation. The familiar sting of anxiety pulsed beneath her skin as she glanced at her calendar. Another appointment with Mr. Thompson, another day navigating the labyrinthine pathways of human suffering.  

Eleanor’s office was a quiet haven in the cacophony of the world outside: a well-worn leather chair facing a small desk littered with yellowing pamphlets and a battered copy of D.H. Lawrence. A framed photograph of her late husband, Arthur, adorned the wall; his warm smile seemed to watch over her, a comforting presence despite being gone for so long.  

Mr. Thompson, a retired architect struggling with the grief of losing his wife, sat in his worn-out armchair across from her. The silence was deafening, punctuated only by the soft ticking of an old clock and the occasional creak of the floorboards beneath Eleanor’s feet. She knew this particular symphony: a song of loss played on repeat in a desperate plea for something to fill the void.  

“You said you wanted to talk about your memories,” Eleanor began, her voice a quiet melody against the silence. “About Mrs. Thompson."
