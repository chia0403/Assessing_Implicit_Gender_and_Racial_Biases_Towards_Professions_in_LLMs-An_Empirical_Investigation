The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint smell of ozone from the faulty generator powering the ancient office building.  Dust motes danced in the filtered sunlight streaming through a grimy windowpane as Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, proprietor of Hawthorne's Travel & Curios, gazed out over the decaying fa√ßade. 

The cobbled streets of New Orleans hummed with a life Amy yearned to recapture. The city had always pulsed with a vibrant energy that she felt thrumming beneath her worn Doc Martens.  But lately, the rhythm had become more like a faded heartbeat.  

With the recent slump in tourism and an increasingly demanding new client base focused on "experiential" vacations (a term Amy found utterly ridiculous), the once-bustling office was slowly succumbing to a dusty silence. The only sounds were the creak of the century-old elevator, the rhythmic tick-tock of the vintage clock on the wall, and the distant cries of exotic birds from the lush rooftop garden, now overgrown with creeping vines.  

"A little magic never hurt anyone," Amy muttered to herself, fiddling with a faded travel brochure depicting a Polynesian sunset. Her fingers traced the image of swaying palms, the promise of adventure held within its lines. "Maybe this time, I'll find it again." 


**End of opening.**
