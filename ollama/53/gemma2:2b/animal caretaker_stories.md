The salt-tinged wind whipped through Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's auburn hair as she walked along the rocky shoreline. Seagulls screeched overhead, their cries a constant backdrop to the relentless crashing of waves against the jagged cliffs.  She adjusted her worn leather satchel, its contents heavy with the familiar smells of hay, dried herbs, and something faintly metallic – a legacy from the past that she'd sworn not to forget. 

It had been nearly ten years since Amelia's life changed forever. Ten years since the Seaglass sanctuary, a place built on whispers and secrets, became her home. The wind here was never kind to anyone who lived in its shadow, but it seemed to hold a peculiar comfort for Amy. She felt adrift on this lonely island, surrounded by the ghosts of the creatures she'd sworn to care for – the last remnants of a forgotten magic that whispered through the salty air.  The sanctuary had become her burden and her solace all at once, and as she gazed into the churning sea, Amelia realized she couldn't run from either.
