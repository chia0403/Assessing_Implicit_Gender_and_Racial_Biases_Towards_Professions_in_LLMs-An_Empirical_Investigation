## Setting: The Obsidian Citadel

The towering obsidian walls of the Obsidian Citadel pierced the smoke-choked sky.  Above, only the faintest sliver of moonlight struggled through layers of clouds, leaving the city shrouded in perpetual twilight. Within its rusted iron gates lay the heart of Veridian, a sprawling metropolis that traded power and wealth for whispered spells, where magic itself was currency. 

**Name:** Alastor Thorne 

Alastor Thorne, his weathered face etched with years spent battling both monsters and corruption, stood sentinel at the city gate.  His thick beard, dyed the color of midnight by soot-choked air, hid a scowl that could curdle milk. His gaze was fixed on the swirling mist beyond the threshold, searching for any sign of trouble. 

A heavy chain rattled as his boots thudded against the cobblestones.  He tightened his grip on his worn leather-bound rapier, its blade gleaming dully in the unnatural twilight. Every night felt like an eternity in the Obsidian Citadel, a city that clung to its ancient secrets with venomous fascination. Tonight, he was alone. 

A low hum resonated from within the citadel, vibrating through the stone like an ominous heartbeat. Alastor tightened his grip on the sword handle, feeling the familiar tug of unease at the edge of his awareness. He could feel the city's magic pulse beneath his feet, a restless force that promised both beauty and danger in equal measure. 


**What happens next?**  Will he face trouble? Will Alastor discover something unsettling about the quiet hum echoing through the citadel?
