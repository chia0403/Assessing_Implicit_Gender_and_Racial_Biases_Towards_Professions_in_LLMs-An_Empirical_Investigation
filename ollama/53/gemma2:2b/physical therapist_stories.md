## The River's Flow

Rain hammered against the windows of Willow Creek Rehab, each drop a tiny percussionist in the symphony of the storm. Inside, amidst the soft scent of lavender-infused lotion and the quiet hum of electric machines, Amelia "Amy" Evans worked tirelessly, her patient, Mr. Henderson, lying immobile on the massage table. The rhythmic thrumming of his prosthetic heart, connected to a series of blinking LEDs on a nearby console, was almost hypnotic. 

Amy sighed, her eyes drooping from fatigue. Despite years of experience and countless patients who had come through these doors, she found herself struggling with Mr. Henderson's case. His fractured hip, sustained in a freak accident while gardening, wasn’t just a physical obstacle – it was a mental one. The man, once a jovial woodcarver known for his intricate bird carvings, was now trapped within the confines of his own fear and anger. He refused even the slightest notion of moving, let alone walking again. 

He reminded Amy of the rushing river beyond her window – powerful yet contained, poised to burst forth until the right forces pushed it in a new direction.  Her patience thrummed with the rhythm of Mr. Henderson’s heart. But would she have the strength to guide him across the turbulent waters and into the calmer shore, towards a future he himself desired?
