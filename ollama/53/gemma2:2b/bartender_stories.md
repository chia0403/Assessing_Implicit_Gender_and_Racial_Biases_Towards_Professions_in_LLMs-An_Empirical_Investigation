Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mug, echoing the thunder that was building in the sky.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and simmering frustration. It was a Friday night like any other - another symphony of drunken arguments, spilled drinks, and silent whispers of heartbreak - but tonight, something felt different. 

There was an unease hanging over the patrons, their faces reflecting the storm's fury.  Even the usually jovial barkeep, Elias Thorne, seemed oddly subdued. His dark eyes, normally twinkling with mischief, were clouded with a weariness that went beyond his late nights. He stood behind the counter, his familiar grin replaced by a grim scowl as he poured another drink into a chipped mug. 

Elias was everything you'd expect from a man named Thorne: strong, silent, with a gaze that could pierce steel.  He wasn't just a bartender; he was an alchemist of sorrow, brewing potent concoctions for the weary souls who stumbled into The Rusty Mug. He was known for his encyclopedic knowledge of cocktails and his uncanny ability to read people faster than they could blink. Tonight, however, even Elias seemed to be searching for answers in the swirling amber liquid before him.
