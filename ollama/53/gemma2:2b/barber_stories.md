## The Whispering Clippers

**Setting:**  A ramshackle barbershop perched on the edge of a bustling seaside town called Havenwood. It's weathered by years of salt air and salty winds, but still somehow manages to exude an old-world charm with its faded green paint, mismatched chairs, and chipped porcelain sink. 

**Character:** Bartholomew "Bart" Worthington,  a man whose thinning hair matched the uneven lines on his face and whose hands moved with a practiced ease over clippers and shears. He was known as 'Barty' by everyone who frequented his shop, except for Mrs. Henderson across the street, who insisted on calling him "Mr. Worthington," even though he never once acknowledged her in return. 

**Opening:**  The rhythmic hum of the electric clipper filled the air like a lazy heartbeat. Bart leaned back against the worn wooden counter, his eyes fixed on a man's reflection in the silver-tinted mirror across from him. "A classic fade, young Thomas," he muttered, tracing a path with the razor down the sideburns before starting on the crown.  The sea breeze pushed through the open window, carrying with it the scent of salt and seaweed, a reminder of both the life Bart had chosen and the one that was slipping away from him, day by day.
