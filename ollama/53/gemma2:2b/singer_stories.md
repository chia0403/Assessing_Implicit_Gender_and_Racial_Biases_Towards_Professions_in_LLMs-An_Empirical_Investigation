## Setting: The Neon Jungle

**Scene:** A rain-slicked back alley in Seattle's bustling Pike Place district. The neon lights from nearby nightclubs bleed into the grimy streets, casting a kaleidoscope of colors onto the puddles and overflowing garbage bins.  The air hums with a mix of cheap perfume, exhaust fumes, and an underlying current of melancholy that whispers through the city like a cold wind.

**Character:** Elias Thorne, known on stage as 'Elysian' - his voice, rich and ethereal, could melt glaciers or ignite revolutions depending on the song.  Tonight, however, he was just Elias, battered by self-doubt and longing for something more than the dingy dive bars where he played. 

**Story Opening:**

Elias tightened his grip on the worn velvet case holding his last remaining microphone cable. His face, usually a canvas of practiced stage persona, looked strained - lines etched deeper than usual.  The gig at "The Salty Dog" was supposed to be a shot in the arm for his career after years spent churning out forgettable tunes and chasing fleeting dreams. Yet tonight, even the familiar buzz of nervous anticipation felt heavy on his chest. The rain hammered down like someone's heart breaking - the same relentless rhythm that beat in his own weary soul.  He closed his eyes for a moment, letting the roar of the city drown him out before whispering into the empty space where a stage awaited. "I think it's time to sing again."
