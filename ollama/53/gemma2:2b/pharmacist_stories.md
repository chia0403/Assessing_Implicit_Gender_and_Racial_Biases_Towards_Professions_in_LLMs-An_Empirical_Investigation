The humid air hung thick in the glass-walled pharmacy like a sleeping fog.  Amelia Winthrop, her white apron dusted with chalky flour from making last night's batch of cough syrup, adjusted her spectacles and sighed. It was 2:30 AM on Wednesday, and this particular Wednesday felt especially heavy â€“ burdened by grief and the hushed quiet of empty streets. The town of Maple Creek had always been small, but in recent weeks it seemed to have shrunk further, as if the entire place were holding its breath until a storm passed.

The silence was broken only by the rhythmic beep of the pharmacy's cash register and the distant rumble of a tractor on Main Street (which, Amelia liked to think, might somehow help dispel the eerie quiet).  She glanced out the window at the crescent moon hanging low in the sky. Tonight, she didn't feel like making her usual rounds - helping Mrs. Peterson with her persistent constipation or dispensing Mr. Johnson's daily dose of melatonin for his insomnia. Amelia wasn't meant for routine, not tonight.  Tonight, the silence had a weight to it, a quiet tension that seemed to vibrate in her bones. 

She was supposed to be starting on her most daring experiment yet: formulating a new batch of calming-the-nervous-system tincture - one that promised to ease the anxieties bubbling under the surface of Maple Creek's collective consciousness. But something about tonight felt like an impossible climb, and Amelia found herself staring at the dusty bottles lining the shelves as if she might find solace in their labels -  a little reassurance in a world that seemed increasingly lost at sea.
