The recycled air hummed with a low, insistent drone, mirroring the dull ache in Amelia Rose Cartwright's temples.  Above her, the plastic smile of a cartoon sun plastered onto the overhead compartment blinked cheerfully, oblivious to the simmering tension brewing amongst the passengers on Flight 742 from Chicago to Miami. A toddler wailed somewhere near the back, punctuated by sharp shrieks of "Are we there yet?" and exasperated sighs from weary parents. Amelia pasted on her own practiced smile, adjusting her navy-blue scarf and smoothing down the creases in her crisp uniform. This was supposed to be a routine red-eye, nothing Amelia hadn't handled before. Yet, something felt off - a prickling unease she couldn't quite place. As she navigated the cramped aisle, distributing lukewarm coffee and stale pretzels, she noticed an unusual number of nervous glances, hushed whispers exchanged in the shadows between seats.

Outside, the moonless sky stretched out in an endless expanse of inky black, punctuated only by the occasional blinking beacon from a distant aircraft. The air was thick with anticipation, charged with an unspoken fear that Amelia couldn't shake off.
