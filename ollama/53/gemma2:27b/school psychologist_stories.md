The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an unsettling pallor over Ms. Amelia Blackwood's tidy office. Outside her window, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied dances across the asphalt playground, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside Amelia herself. 

As the school psychologist for Elmwood Elementary, Amelia was accustomed to navigating the complexities of young minds, deciphering anxieties and unraveling behavioral knots. Yet, today felt different. A knot of unease tightened in her own chest as she reread the file in front of her - Daniel Hawthorne's case. His recent drawings, once whimsical depictions of fantastical creatures, now depicted shadowed figures lurking in corners, menacing eyes peering from behind trees. The accompanying written narrative spoke of whispers he heard in the night and a growing sense of being watched. 

Amelia pushed away the file, the chilling details clinging to her like cobwebs. Something about Daniel's case resonated with a primal fear she couldn't shake off, a feeling that this wasn't simply childhood imagination run amok. This was something darker, something...unseen.
