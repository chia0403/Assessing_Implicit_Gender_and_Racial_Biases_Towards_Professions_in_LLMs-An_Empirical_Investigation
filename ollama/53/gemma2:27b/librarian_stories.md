Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Thistlewick. Stacks of overdue notices towered precariously on her desk, each one a testament to the library's dwindling patronage. 

Amelia, with her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose and her auburn braid escaping its confines, sighed. The once-grand library, built in the Victorian era with mahogany shelves that stretched towards vaulted ceilings adorned with intricate frescoes, now echoed with an unsettling silence.  The scent of old paper and leather usually brought her comfort, but today it felt like a shroud. 

Just then, a gust of wind rattled the heavy oak doors, sending a shiver down Amelia's spine. A figure emerged from the storm, shaking water off a tattered tweed coat.  Amelia couldn't make out the face obscured by the shadows of the hood, but something about the way they held themselves, with an air of quiet urgency, piqued her curiosity.
