The polished marble floor gleamed under the flickering chandeliers of the Grand Majestic Hotel. Outside, rain lashed against the ornate windows, obscuring the twinkling lights of the city below. Inside, however, all was warm and inviting: a crackling fire danced in the hearth, potted palms swayed gently, and the air hummed with hushed conversations and clinking champagne glasses. 

Theodore Archibald Bartholomew III, or "Theo" to anyone who dared address him directly, maneuvered his luggage trolley through the bustling lobby with practiced ease. A symphony of squeaking wheels and muffled curses followed him as he weaved between guests engrossed in their own arrival dramas. Theo, with his neatly combed auburn hair and crisp bellhop uniform, was a familiar sight at the Grand Majestic. He'd been there longer than most employees, his tenure stretching back to when the hotel was still a haven for flappers and gangsters during the roaring twenties.  

Tonight, however, felt different. A strange tension crackled in the air. Theo caught snippets of conversation - whispers about a stolen jewel, a suspicious guest, a looming storm. It all seemed rather melodramatic, even for the Grand Majestic. But as he reached his destination – a suite on the top floor with a view overlooking the rain-soaked city – Theo couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to unfold.
