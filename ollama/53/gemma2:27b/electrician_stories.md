Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shed, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray. The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of ozone and damp earth.  Elias "Eli" Montgomery tightened his grip on the rusty wrench, forcing himself to ignore the gnawing ache in his lower back. He was knee-deep in the guts of an ancient generator, its wiring a tangled mess that looked more like a spiderweb than anything designed by human hands.

This dilapidated shed, tucked away at the edge of a forgotten orchard in rural Vermont, served as Eli's workshop and sanctuary.  He preferred the company of humming transformers and sparking wires to the relentless chatter of the town folk. Here, amongst the dusty tools and flickering fluorescent lights, he could lose himself in the intricate dance of electricity.

But this job was proving more stubborn than usual. The generator, a relic from a bygone era, refused to cooperate. Every time Eli thought he'd isolated the problem, another gremlin would emerge, sending him back into the labyrinthine depths of its wiring.
