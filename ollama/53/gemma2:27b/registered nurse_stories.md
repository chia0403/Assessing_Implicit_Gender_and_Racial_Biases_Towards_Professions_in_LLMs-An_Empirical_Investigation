The incessant chirping of the heart monitor punctuated the sterile silence of Amelia Rose Blackwood's world.

Its ancient brick facade and towering stained-glass windows held stories whispered through generations - tales of love and loss, hope and despair, all woven into the very fabric of its walls.
