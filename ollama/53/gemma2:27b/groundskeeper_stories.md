The rusted gate groaned like an old man complaining about the weather as Thaddeus Bartholomew Finch wrestled it open. Dew clung to his threadbare overalls, mirroring the sheen on the sprawling emerald lawn before him. Sunbeams, slanting through the ancient oaks that ringed the estate, painted shifting patterns of light and shadow across the perfectly manicured grounds.

Thaddeus, with a lifetime's worth of wrinkles etched around his kind blue eyes, surveyed his domain. The air smelled sweet with honeysuckle and damp earth â€“ a scent he'd come to cherish over his forty years tending to these gardens. Today, however, a prickle of unease ran beneath the familiar comfort. A strange stillness hung in the air, broken only by the distant cawing of crows. Even the sparrows that usually flitted among the roses were conspicuously absent.

As Thaddeus trudged toward the imposing manor house, its windows reflecting the sunrise like watchful eyes, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
