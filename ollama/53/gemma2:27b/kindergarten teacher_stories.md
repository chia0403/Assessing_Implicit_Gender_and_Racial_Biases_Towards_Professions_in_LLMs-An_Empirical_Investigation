The pungent scent of glue sticks and construction paper clung to Ms. Juniper Bellweather like a well-worn apron.  It was a familiar smell, one that had permeated her classroom at Sunnyside Elementary for the past seven years. The kindergarten room buzzed with the frenetic energy only twenty five-year-olds could muster. Finger paint stained tiny hands, blocks clattered against linoleum floors, and giggles echoed off the walls adorned with lopsided handprint turkeys and crayon masterpieces depicting abstract family portraits.  

Juniper surveyed the controlled chaos with a smile, her heart swelling with the familiar warmth of watching these little minds bloom. Today was particularly special: it was Show & Tell day, and Juniper knew the room would be brimming with treasured possessions, each one holding a story waiting to be told.
