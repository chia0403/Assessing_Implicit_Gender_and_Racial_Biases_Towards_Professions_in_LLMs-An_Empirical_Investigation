Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond. The steady drumbeat mirrored the anxiety churning in her gut.  Eleanor, with her sharp, intelligent eyes and a mane of unruly auburn hair that she constantly pushed back from her face, wasn't prone to nerves. Years of listening to people's deepest fears and traumas had forged a stoicism within her. But this case, the referral clutched in her hand like a lifeline, felt different. 

The name at the top - Alistair Finch - sent a shiver down her spine. Eleanor had heard whispers about him: a recluse, a genius, perhaps evenâ€¦unstable. He was a renowned mathematician who vanished from public life years ago after making a series of unsettling pronouncements about the nature of reality. Now, he'd reached out, requesting her help. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock, its hands ticking ominously. Alistair Finch was due to arrive any minute, and she couldn't shake the feeling that this meeting would change everything.
