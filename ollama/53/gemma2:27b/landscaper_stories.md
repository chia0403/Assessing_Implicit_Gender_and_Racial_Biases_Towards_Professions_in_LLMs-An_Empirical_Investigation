The sun beat down on Elias Hawthorne's neck, turning his already rosy skin a shade closer to lobster red. He wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of dirt across his forehead. The air hung heavy with humidity, thick enough to chew, and cicadas thrummed their incessant summer song from the canopy of ancient oaks surrounding Mrs. Hawthorne's (no relation) sprawling estate.

Elias surveyed the overgrown expanse before him, a tapestry woven from untamed ivy, struggling roses, and knee-high weeds. It was a daunting task, but Elias relished the challenge. Transforming neglected landscapes into vibrant havens was his calling, a quiet symphony played out in the language of soil, sun, and seed.
