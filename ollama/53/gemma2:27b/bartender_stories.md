The neon sign outside flickered, casting an unsettling purple glow on the rain-slicked cobblestones. It read "The Gilded Gryphon" in faded, Art Deco lettering, promising a sanctuary from the dreary London night. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of spilled whiskey, pipe tobacco, and regret.  

Elias Blackwood adjusted his bowtie, a gesture ingrained from years behind the mahogany bar. The usual clientele – weary businessmen drowning their sorrows, lovelorn poets seeking inspiration, and the occasional clandestine meeting shrouded in hushed whispers – were scattered across the dimly lit room. Elias knew each of them by name, their orders memorized, their woes whispered into the void beneath the amber glow of the hanging lamps. Tonight, however, something felt different. A restless energy pulsed through the air, a discordant note against the familiar melody of The Gilded Gryphon.  

A figure entered from the rain, shaking droplets from a worn leather trench coat. Elias watched as the newcomer approached, his shadowed face obscured by the brim of a fedora. This wasn't one of their regulars.
