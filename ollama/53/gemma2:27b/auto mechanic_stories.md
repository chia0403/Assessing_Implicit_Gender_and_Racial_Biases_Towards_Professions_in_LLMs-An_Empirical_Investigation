The grease under Amelia "Amy" Santiago's fingernails wasn't just grime; it was a badge of honor.  Each smudge, each speck of black, represented another engine coaxed back to life in her ramshackle garage tucked away on the dusty outskirts of Harmony Springs.

The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil and gasoline, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of Amy's wrench against a stubborn bolt. Outside, cicadas thrummed their ceaseless summer song, a counterpoint to the whine of her pneumatic drill as she tackled a rusty '67 Mustang. Sunlight streamed through the cracked windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the cluttered workspace. Tools hung haphazardly from pegboards, interspersed with faded photographs of vintage cars and dog-eared racing magazines. A half-eaten sandwich sat precariously on a toolbox, evidence of Amy's relentless work ethic.

But today was different. Today, a sleek black car unlike any she'd seen before rolled into her bay, its engine purring like a contented panther. A man with eyes as cold and blue as glaciers stepped out, his tailored suit incongruous against the backdrop of rusted metal and oil stains. He handed Amy a card – "Mr. Lucian Thorne" it read in embossed silver letters – and said simply, "Fix it."
