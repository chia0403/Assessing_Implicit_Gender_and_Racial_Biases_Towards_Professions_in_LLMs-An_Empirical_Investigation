The grand oak doors swung inward with a sigh, admitting Evelyn Blackwood into the lobby's hushed grandeur. The air shimmered with the scent of lilies and beeswax polish, a familiar embrace after a long day navigating the labyrinthine demands of the Fairmont Hotel. Crystal chandeliers dripped light onto polished marble floors, reflecting the opulent world that Evelyn expertly navigated. She straightened her navy blazer, the gold concierge button glinting under the shimmering lights, and surveyed the scene: a gaggle of tourists clustered around a map, a couple whispering sweet nothings in a secluded alcove, and Mrs. Van Derlyn impatiently tapping her foot by the elevators.

Evelyn smiled inwardly. Another night at the Fairmont, another tapestry woven from the desires and dilemmas of its guests. Tonight, however, promised to be different. A telegram had arrived earlier that day, cryptic and urgent: "Arrival imminent. Midnight. Discreet arrangement required. - S." 

Intrigue sparked in Evelyn's chest. This wasn't the usual request for dinner reservations or theatre tickets. This smelled of secrets and shadows, a welcome change from the predictable rhythm of her days.
