The humid Savannah air clung to Elara Delacroix like a second skin as she squinted at the dilapidated antebellum mansion through her viewfinder. Spanish moss dripped from ancient oak branches, casting eerie shadows across the overgrown lawn. It was perfect. Too perfect, maybe.

Elara, a woman whose artistic vision often blurred the lines between reality and cinematic fantasy, felt a shiver run down her spine. This crumbling relic of Southern grandeur, with its peeling paint and boarded-up windows, held secrets whispered on the wind. It was the ideal location for her latest film, a haunting psychological thriller set against the backdrop of the Civil War.

But something about the silence, broken only by the distant cawing of crows, felt unnerving. The history embedded in these crumbling walls seemed to seep into Elara's bones, reminding her that even the most carefully constructed illusions could shatter under the weight of hidden truths.
