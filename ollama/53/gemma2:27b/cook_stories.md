The acrid scent of burnt garlic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet perfume of simmering tomatoes and the sharp tang of vinegar. Beatrice "Bea" Delacroix scowled at the blackened clove on her cutting board, cursing her momentary lapse in concentration.  It was a Wednesday, which meant the lunchtime rush at La Petite Boulangerie would be relentless. Tourists, lured by the promise of authentic French pastries and freshly brewed coffee, would swarm the cozy café nestled in the heart of Montmartre.

Bea wasn't one for crowds. She preferred the quiet solitude of her kitchen, where she could lose herself in the rhythmic chopping of vegetables, the gentle hiss of sautéing onions, and the methodical whisking of sauces. But running a bakery meant catering to the whims of hungry patrons, and Bea was determined to deliver the best damn croissants and pain au chocolat in all of Paris.

Today, however, felt different. A prickling unease snaked down her spine as she glanced out the window, towards the cobblestone street bustling with activity.  A peculiar stillness hung in the air, a hush before the storm. And Bea couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous was about to unfold.
