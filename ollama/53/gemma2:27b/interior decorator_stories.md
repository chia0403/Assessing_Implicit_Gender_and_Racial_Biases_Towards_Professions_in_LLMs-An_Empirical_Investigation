Rain lashed against the arched windowpanes of Rosalind Amelia Cartwright's atelier, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  Her phone lay abandoned on the antique rosewood desk, its screen displaying the dreaded "Call Ended" message. Yet another client had backed out, citing unforeseen circumstances - code for "I found someone cheaper." 

Rosalind, with her penchant for bespoke designs and ethically-sourced materials, rarely fit into the "cheap" category. Her studio, nestled in a quiet cobblestone alley in the heart of Paris, was a testament to her unwavering belief in the power of design to transform lives. Sunlight streamed through stained glass panels, casting vibrant hues onto walls adorned with sketches of fantastical rooms and mood boards bursting with textures.

But today, even the whimsical charm of her workspace couldn't dispel the growing unease. Rosalind needed this commission. Her savings were dwindling, and the rent on her charming but decidedly impractical Parisian apartment wouldn't pay itself.  As a knock echoed through the studio, she straightened her posture, hoping for a ray of sunshine to pierce the storm clouds gathering above her.
