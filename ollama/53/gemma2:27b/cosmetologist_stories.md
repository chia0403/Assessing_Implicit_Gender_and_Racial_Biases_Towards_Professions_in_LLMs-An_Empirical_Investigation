The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and formaldehyde in "Glamour Haven," Elara Montgomery's haven from the storm. Rain lashed against the storefront windows, blurring the neon pink "Open" sign into an abstract watercolor. Elara sighed, watching the downpour through a gap in the curtains.  

It wasn't just the weather that felt oppressive. Three weeks with barely a client. Rent was due, and her landlord, Mr. Bellini, had begun leaving increasingly passive-aggressive notes on her door: "Hope business picks up soon!" they chirped, each one adorned with a cartoon smiley face that looked suspiciously like a grimace.

Elara smoothed down the lavender apron she wore over her vintage floral dress. Glamour Haven wasn't just a salon; it was her dream, built brick by painstaking brick from years of scrimping and saving. But lately, it felt more like a sinking ship.
