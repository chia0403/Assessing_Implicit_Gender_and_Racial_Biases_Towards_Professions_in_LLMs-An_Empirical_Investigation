The air hung thick with sawdust and the scent of pine, a familiar comfort to Elias Thornewood. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes of his workshop, illuminating the scattered shavings on his workbench and the unfinished rocking horse taking shape under his skilled hands. He ran a calloused thumb over the smooth curve of the horse's mane, tracing its contours with an artist's eye. Outside, the bustling port town of Saltwind hummed with activity – merchants hawking their wares, sailors bellowing orders, and children chasing gulls along the cobblestone streets. But Elias was content in his quiet sanctuary, lost in the rhythm of his craft.  

Today, however, a tension thrummed beneath the surface of his usual calm. A letter lay unopened on his workbench, its seal bearing the unfamiliar crest of the Thornewood estate – a family legacy he'd long believed abandoned. The sight of it stirred a dormant ache in his chest, a yearning for a past he barely remembered.  

Elias paused his work, his gaze fixed on the letter. He knew what it meant. It was time to face the ghosts of his history.
