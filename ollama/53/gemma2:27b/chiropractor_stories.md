Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Thorne's chiropractic office, blurring the already dim streetlights into smudges of orange. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old Victorian building that housed her practice. Eve sighed, rubbing her temples, the persistent ache mirroring the storm raging outside. It was a slow Tuesday night, a fact underlined by the absence of patients in her waiting room and the echoing silence within her treatment room.

She glanced at the clock ticking away on the wall â€“ 7:45 PM.  Most of her regular patients had already come in for their adjustments earlier in the day. Now, Eve found herself facing an empty evening, a rarity in her busy practice nestled within the quaint coastal town of Seahaven. The storm, however, seemed determined to keep anyone from venturing out, turning Seahaven into a ghost town shrouded in rain and wind.

Eve grabbed her mug filled with lukewarm chamomile tea, the scent a faint comfort against the dreary weather. Just then, a sharp rapping on the door startled her.
