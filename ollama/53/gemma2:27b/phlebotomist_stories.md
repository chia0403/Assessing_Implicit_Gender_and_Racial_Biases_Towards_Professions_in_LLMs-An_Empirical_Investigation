Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy Hospital, blurring the streetlights into shimmering halos. Eleanor Vance sighed, watching the downpour from her station in the dimly lit lab. The smell of antiseptic mingled with the faint tang of iron – a familiar scent that always seemed to cling to the air in this place. As the sole phlebotomist on duty for the night shift, Eleanor was used to the solitude. It suited her, in a way.

She liked the quiet rhythm of drawing blood, the methodical routine. It felt grounding, almost meditative. But tonight, even the familiar calm couldn't dispel the growing unease that prickled at the back of her neck. The storm wasn’t just affecting the weather; it seemed to be seeping into the very walls of the hospital.

The phone on her desk suddenly buzzed, shattering the silence. It was Dr. Lewis from the ER, his voice tight with urgency. "Eleanor," he said, "We have a patient coming in, critical condition. Need you stat."
