Rain lashed against the windows of The Ark Veterinary Clinic, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a shimmering mess. Inside, Dr. Eleanor Vance sighed as she watched another gust whip a stray newspaper across the deserted parking lot.  It was a Tuesday, the kind that felt like it had already lasted a week. Business had been slow, and Eleanor, despite loving her work, couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness. 

The clinic itself was cozy, with worn oak floors, the scent of antiseptic mingling with lavender from a diffuser in the corner, and framed animal photographs lining the walls. But today, the silence felt heavy, amplifying the ticking clock on the wall. Eleanor idly stroked the head of Jasper, her ginger tabby who often kept her company during quiet hours. 

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled sharply, jolting Eleanor from her thoughts. She glanced up, expecting to see Mrs. Henderson with her perpetually coughing poodle, but instead found herself staring at a young man she'd never met before. He was tall and lean, with rain-soaked hair plastered to his forehead and worry etched into his handsome features.
