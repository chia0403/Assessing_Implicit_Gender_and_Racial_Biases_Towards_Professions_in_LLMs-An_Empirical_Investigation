The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Blackwood Theatre hummed an off-key symphony, casting long, skeletal shadows across the dusty velvet seats. Theodore "Teddy" Finch sighed, the sound swallowed by the cavernous space. He leaned against his mop, a battered old thing that smelled faintly of bleach and regret, and surveyed the wreckage left behind by another night's performance.

Scattered popcorn kernels crunched underfoot, discarded programs lay curled like forgotten promises, and a rogue feather boa shimmered ominously beneath the stage lights. Teddy, with his greying ponytail peeking from beneath a faded "Grand Blackwood" cap, was the only soul brave enough to face the theatre's post-show gloom.

He loved this place, despite its occasional tendency towards dramatic melodrama. It held memories â€“ whispers of laughter, the echo of applause, and the phantom scent of stage makeup that clung stubbornly to the air. But tonight, a prickle of unease ran down Teddy's spine. Something felt different, off-kilter.
