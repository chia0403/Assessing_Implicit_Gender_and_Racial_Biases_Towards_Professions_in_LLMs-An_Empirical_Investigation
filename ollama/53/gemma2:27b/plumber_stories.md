The insistent drip-drip-dripping echoed through Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's skull like a frantic Morse code message. It was 3:00 am, the city outside her window still humming with the remnants of Friday night revelry, but Amy was wide awake, wrestling with a pipe wrench and a stubborn faucet in Mrs. Henderson's bathroom.

Mrs. Henderson, bless her heart, insisted on fixing this leaky faucet "before it drowned the whole damn building," as she put it. A sentiment Amy understood, considering the plumbing situation in their century-old Brooklyn brownstone was akin to a temperamental toddler - prone to sudden outbursts and unexpected leaks.

The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and lavender air freshener, a strange but somehow fitting combination for a bathroom bathed in dim fluorescent light. The faucet itself, a monstrously ornate brass contraption from another era, glared back at her defiantly.  Amy tightened the wrench again, muttering a curse under her breath as she felt the metal groan.

This wasn't how Amy envisioned spending her Friday night. She'd rather be curled up with a good book and a cup of tea, but in this building, plumbing emergencies were like unwelcome guests â€“ always arriving at the worst possible moment.
