Rain lashed against the bakery window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into an impressionistic smear. Inside, Amelia Cartwright sighed, pushing away a plate piled high with croissants that seemed to mock her profession.  The aroma of butter and sugar was intoxicating, but as a registered dietician who specialized in helping people manage chronic illnesses through nutrition, she knew these pastries were best left untouched.

Amelia ran her fingers over the worn countertop, its surface scarred by countless years of dough being kneaded and bread being shaped. This quaint bakery, nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, had been her grandmother's pride and joy. Now, it sat heavy with unspoken memories and the bittersweet scent of Amelia's past. 

Today was the grand reopening, six months after her grandmother's passing. Amelia had promised to honor her memory by breathing new life into the place, but the task felt monumental. Her grandmother's recipes were legendary, her sourdough starter a prized heirloom. But could Amelia, who'd always been more comfortable in the sterile environment of a hospital kitchen than amidst flour and sugar, ever hope to fill her shoes?
