Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in his chest. The flickering fluorescent light cast long shadows across the cluttered desk, highlighting stacks of unfiled claims and a half-eaten tuna sandwich rapidly becoming one with the growing mold colony on his desk lamp. Bart Quill, insurance agent extraordinaire (at least that's what his mother called him), stared forlornly at the phone, its silence deafening. 

His office, perched precariously above a laundromat in a less-than-glamorous part of town, was a monument to his dwindling success. The once-bright carpet had faded to a sickly yellow, and the peeling wallpaper threatened to stage an uprising against the damp walls. Bart sighed, the scent of mildew mingling with the stale aroma of tuna filling his nostrils. Today was the day he needed a win, a big one, to stave off the looming specter of eviction. 

But the phone remained stubbornly silent.
