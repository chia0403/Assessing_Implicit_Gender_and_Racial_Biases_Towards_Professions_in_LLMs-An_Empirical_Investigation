Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia Blackwood's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. The incessant drumming matched the rhythm of her headache. A half-eaten bowl of ramen sat on her desk, its noodles congealing into a murky soup.

Amelia, lead editor at the struggling independent publishing house, “Inkwell Press”, sighed and rubbed her temples. It was 3 am, and she was knee-deep in a manuscript that read like it had been written by a caffeinated parrot. Her caffeine intake rivaled the parrot's, but even its jittery energy couldn't penetrate the fog of grammatical errors and nonsensical plot twists.

The flickering fluorescent light above cast harsh shadows on the cluttered desk: stacks of manuscripts threatening to topple, overflowing ashtrays, and a neglected mug that once held her sanity (or at least, enough coffee to pretend she had some).  Amelia longed for the days when books were her escape, not her burden.
