The neon sign of the "Last Chance Diner" buzzed intermittently, casting a sickly green light across Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's weathered face as he pulled his rig into the deserted truck stop. The desert wind howled around him, a mournful symphony punctuated by the groaning metal of his eighteen-wheeler settling onto the cracked asphalt.

Silas squinted at the diner through dusty windshield wipers. It looked like something out of an old Western movie - a lonely outpost in the middle of nowhere, promising greasy comfort and dubious company. He sighed, rubbing a calloused hand over his stubbled chin. Another night on the road, another nameless town swallowed by the vast emptiness of Nevada. 

He'd been hauling cargo for twenty years, crisscrossing this country like a nomad, but the loneliness was starting to gnaw at him. Maybe it was the silence, broken only by the hum of the engine and the crackle of his CB radio. Or maybe it was the endless ribbon of highway stretching before him, leading nowhere in particular.

Whatever it was, Silas felt adrift. He needed a change, something to break the monotony.  He just wasn't sure what that something could be.
