Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Moreau's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The flickering fluorescent light cast harsh shadows across her cluttered desk, piled high with case files and half-eaten takeout containers.  Outside, the neon glow of Bourbon Street struggled to penetrate the deluge, casting an eerie, otherworldly sheen on the usually vibrant street. New Orleans was drowning, both literally and figuratively.

Izzy rubbed her temples, willing away the throbbing headache that had become a constant companion these past few weeks. Three murders in as many days, each victim seemingly unconnected, yet all bearing the same cryptic symbol etched into their palms: a stylized fleur-de-lis encircled by thorns. It was unnerving, to say the least. 

The phone on her desk buzzed, jarring her from her thoughts. Glancing at the caller ID, she saw it was Sergeant Dubois. "Moreau," she answered gruffly.
