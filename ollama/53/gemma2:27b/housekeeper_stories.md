The smell of lavender polish lingered in the air, a ghostly fragrance clinging to Eliza Jane Cartwright as she surveyed her work. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows of the drawing-room, catching dust motes dancing in the stillness. Outside, the manicured gardens of Blackwood Manor sprawled beneath a sky the color of forget-me-nots, but Eliza barely noticed. Her gaze was fixed on the mahogany table, its surface gleaming like polished obsidian. 

Blackwood Manor was a tapestry woven from whispers and secrets. Built in the 1700s, it had housed generations of the Blackwood family, each leaving their imprint on the manor's soul. Now, only the elderly matriarch, Eleanor Blackwood, remained, a reclusive figure who rarely left her wing of the house.

Eliza had been housekeeper for five years, her life punctuated by the rhythm of cleaning, polishing, and ensuring Blackwood Manor remained a pristine monument to its past. But something felt different today. A prickling sensation danced along her spine, a sense that the manor was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.
