The bell for third period shrieked like a banshee trapped in a tin can, echoing through the cavernous hallways of Northwood High. Amelia Cartwright sighed, pushing her unruly auburn curls out of her eyes as she surveyed the battlefield that was her classroom. Desks were strewn with crumpled papers, half-eaten granola bars, and abandoned textbooks. The air hung thick with the scent of stale pizza and teenage apathy. 

Amelia wasn't sure what was more daunting: wrangling thirty sleep-deprived teenagers into deciphering Shakespearean sonnets or facing the looming mountain of grading on her desk. Today, however, a new challenge presented itself in the form of a poster taped haphazardly to her door. "Poetry Slam Competition," it proclaimed in bold, glittery letters. Beneath, a hand-drawn image of a microphone threatened to consume a trembling quill.

Amelia's stomach clenched.  She loved poetry, but the thought of her students baring their souls on stage filled her with a strange mixture of dread and morbid curiosity. This year was already shaping up to be more chaotic than usual, what with budget cuts, standardized testing pressure, and a seemingly endless influx of new, unpredictable freshmen. Maybe this poetry slam was exactly what they all needed â€“ a chance to express themselves, connect with each other, and maybe even discover the beauty hidden within their own lives.  


Or maybe it would be an utter disaster.
