The sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's neck as he surveyed his fields, each row of corn stretching towards the hazy horizon like emerald fingers reaching for the sky. Sweat trickled down his weathered face, leaving streaks in the dust that clung to his skin. The air hung heavy with the scent of dry earth and ripening grain, a familiar perfume Silas had inhaled for all his sixty-two years. 

This year, however, the perfume held a tinge of anxiety.  The drought had been relentless, sucking the moisture from the soil and leaving the corn stalks stunted and pale. Silas ran a calloused hand over a withered leaf, its edges curling inwards like a fist in despair. He needed rain, and he needed it soon.


His gaze drifted towards the distant treeline where the gnarled branches of ancient oaks whispered secrets to the wind. Beyond them lay Blackwood Creek, usually a gurgling lifeline through his land, but now reduced to a sluggish trickle. The creek mirrored Silas' own dwindling hope.
