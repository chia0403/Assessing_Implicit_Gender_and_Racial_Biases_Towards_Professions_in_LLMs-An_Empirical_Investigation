The relentless Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Vance's neck as he wrestled with a rusted guardrail post. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the shimmering heat haze rising from the cracked asphalt. The endless stretch of Highway 50 shimmered before him, baking under a sky the color of bleached denim. Eli grunted, heaving against the stubborn metal. He'd been at it for hours, replacing sections damaged in a recent truck accident. The smell of hot rubber and diesel lingered in the air, a grim reminder of the near-fatal collision.

Eli wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, wishing he'd brought more water. He glanced towards the horizon, where the jagged peaks of the Toiyabe Range pierced the hazy blue sky. The mountains offered little respite from the unforgiving sun, their shadows stretched thin and weak across the vast desert expanse. Eli sighed, a long, weary exhale that mingled with the dry desert wind.  

He knew this stretch of highway like the back of his hand â€“ every curve, every dip, every faded mile marker. Yet today, the familiar landscape felt alien, oppressive under the scorching sun. A feeling of unease prickled at him, a sense that something was amiss, lurking just beyond the shimmering horizon.
