Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eloise Hawthorne's cramped office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the overflowing filing cabinets and motivational posters that promised success with irritating cheerfulness. Eloise, her auburn hair pulled back in a perpetually tired bun, stared at the student file spread across her desk.

Today, though, Liam's case felt different, heavier somehow. 

Eloise knew she had to find a way to reach him, to break through the wall of grief that seemed to suffocate him. But how do you guide someone who seems determined to lose their way?
