The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's back as he chipped away at a slab of grey granite. Dust plumed into the air with each precise strike of his hammer, coating him in a fine layer that mingled with the sweat staining his rough linen shirt. The quarry echoed with the rhythmic clang of hammers and chisels wielded by a dozen other men, all toiling under the watchful eye of Master Thorne, whose booming voice occasionally pierced the din.

Silas squinted at the rough outline emerging from the stone â€“ a gargoyle intended for the cathedral spire being rebuilt in the city. He was known throughout the quarry for his patience and precision, able to coax intricate details from even the most stubborn rock. But today, Silas felt distracted. His gaze kept drifting towards the distant hills, where the emerald green foliage whispered promises of freedom and escape. For weeks, a yearning had been growing within him, a longing for something beyond the monotonous grind of the quarry.
