The acrid scent of woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eliza Moreau's wool coat like an unwelcome guest. The late October sun, pale and watery behind a curtain of smoke, cast long shadows across the ravaged clearing. A twisted metal skeleton marked what was once a barn, its charred remains still smoldering. 

Eliza, her notebook clutched tightly in one hand, shivered despite the warmth radiating from the small fire crackling nearby. She had come to Harmony Ridge, a remote Appalachian town nestled amidst rolling hills, following whispers of a strange event – a series of unexplained fires that were decimating the region. The locals spoke of them in hushed tones, blaming everything from rogue teenagers to vengeful spirits. But Eliza knew better than to dismiss local folklore; sometimes the truth lay hidden within its tangled threads. 

Taking a deep breath, she approached the group gathered around the fire – weathered farmers and anxious townsfolk, their faces etched with worry and suspicion. This was her story now, the one she hoped would unravel the mystery of Harmony Ridge's fiery curse.
