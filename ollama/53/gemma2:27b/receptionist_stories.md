The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across Evelyn Marie Cartwright's neatly arranged desk. The scent of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint odor of disinfectant that permeated the entire waiting room. Outside the large picture window, the grey sky mirrored the gloom settling in Evelyn's stomach. Another Tuesday afternoon at Dr. Albright's office meant another barrage of sniffles, coughs, and complaints – a symphony of misery that she was expected to greet with a cheery smile and unwavering politeness. 


Evelyn sighed, straightening a stack of outdated magazines on the low table beside her. Today felt particularly bleak, even for a Tuesday. Maybe it was the persistent drizzle outside, or perhaps the fact that Mrs. Henderson had arrived early again, clutching her chihuahua like a furry shield against the world's ills. Whatever the reason, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss – a tingling sensation at the back of her neck that whispered of impending change.
