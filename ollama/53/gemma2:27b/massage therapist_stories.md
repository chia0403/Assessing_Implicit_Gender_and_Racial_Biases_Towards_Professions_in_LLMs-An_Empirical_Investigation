Rain lashed against the warped wooden door of "Serenity Springs Massage Therapy," the rhythmic drumming echoing Eleanor Grace Hawthorne's growing anxiety. Her phone buzzed incessantly with cancellation notifications. A blizzard was predicted for later that evening, and her clients were understandably opting for warmth over deep tissue massages.

Eleanor sighed, the scent of lavender and chamomile oil, normally calming, doing little to soothe her nerves today. She had already lost three appointments, which meant she wouldn't meet her rent this month. The quaint cottage where Serenity Springs resided was charming, nestled in a quiet corner of Evergreen Valley, but its charm came with a hefty price tag. 

She glanced at the overflowing basket of fresh towels by the fireplace, each one meticulously folded and ready for the day. A pang of disappointment hit her. She'd been looking forward to using her new eucalyptus-infused massage oil, dreaming of the soothing scent filling the room as she worked her magic on weary muscles. Now, it seemed, those dreams would have to wait.
