The air hung thick with sawdust and sweat under the unrelenting July sun.  Above, skeletal cranes clawed at the sapphire sky, hoisting steel beams into place on the half-finished skyscraper that loomed over downtown Chicago like a concrete giant.  Elias “Eli” Moretti wiped his brow with a grease-stained forearm, squinting at the blueprint spread out on a dusty crate. The foreman, a burly man named Vinnie with a voice like gravel, barked orders from the scaffolding above.

Eli wasn't one for heights. He preferred the solid ground beneath his boots, the satisfying clang of hammer against steel, the steady rhythm of construction that built something tangible, something real.  But today, he had to climb. The new elevator shaft needed reinforcement, and Eli was the best welder in the crew. 

Taking a deep breath, he adjusted the heavy tool belt strapped around his waist and started his ascent up the rickety ladder. As he climbed, the city spread out beneath him like a shimmering tapestry, a dizzying patchwork of concrete and glass reflecting the relentless sun.  He could almost hear the city's pulse, a constant thrumming energy that mirrored the hammering in his chest.

Something felt off though. A prickling unease settled on Eli's shoulders as he neared the top. It wasn't just the height, or the unfamiliar swaying of the scaffolding beneath him.  It was something else, something intangible that whispered a warning in the back of his mind.
