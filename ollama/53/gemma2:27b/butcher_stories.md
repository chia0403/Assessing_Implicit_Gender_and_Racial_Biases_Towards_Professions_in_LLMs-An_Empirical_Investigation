The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and rosemary, a familiar perfume in Archibald "Archie" Thistlewick's world.  Dawn was just breaking over Butcher Row, painting the cobblestone street a pale rose, but Archie was already elbow-deep in a side of beef, his cleaver whistling through the air with practiced ease.

The shop windows, fogged with the chill of the early morning, reflected his image: a broad-shouldered man with a ruddy complexion and a shock of white hair escaping from under his butcher's cap. His calloused hands, stained crimson at the edges, moved with surprising grace as he separated muscle from bone. Archie took pride in his work, seeing himself not just as a purveyor of meat but as an artist sculpting life from flesh.

Today, however, felt different. A tremor of unease ran through him, a premonition as sharp as his cleaver. It wasn't the usual dread associated with dealing with difficult customers or the occasional unsavory cut. This was something deeper, a foreboding that gnawed at the edges of his consciousness.
