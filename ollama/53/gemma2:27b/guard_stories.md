The wind whipped through the crumbling arches of the old city gate, carrying with it the scent of salt and something acrid, like burning iron. Silas Blackwood shivered, pulling his threadbare cloak tighter around him. Even in midday, the shadows cast by the towering stone walls seemed to claw at the meager sunlight, making the cobblestone plaza beneath him feel perpetually cold.

Silas was used to the chill, though. He'd been stationed at the North Gate for five years now, ever since his family farm had been claimed by the Baron's men in some land dispute he hadn't understood. The guard post wasn't glamorous, but it was steady work, and Silas preferred it to the prospect of begging or joining one of the city's notorious gangs.

Today, however, something felt different. The usual cacophony of hawkers, merchants, and gossiping townsfolk seemed muted, replaced by a tense silence broken only by the incessant flapping of Silas' cloak against his legs. He glanced towards the horizon, where the sky was an unsettling shade of green-gray, bruised as if by some unseen fist. A low rumble echoed in the distance, sending a shiver down his spine that had nothing to do with the cold.

Something was coming.
