Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the East End clinic, blurring the view of the graffiti-streaked alleyway outside. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and damp wool, a familiar olfactory cocktail to Eleanor Davies, PT. Her nameplate, tarnished brass on chipped wood, declared her credentials: "Eleanor Davies, DPT, Physical Therapist."

Eleanor herself was far from the polished image projected by the plaque. Her auburn braid, usually neat, had escaped its confines and hung in damp tendrils around her freckled face. Fatigue etched lines beneath her emerald eyes, mirroring the weariness of the building itself. She sighed, rubbing her temples, as a particularly insistent gust rattled the windowpanes.

Today was proving to be one of those days where every patient seemed determined to test her limits, both physical and emotional.  From the elderly gentleman struggling with hip replacement recovery to the young athlete grappling with a torn ACL, Eleanor felt like she was perpetually running uphill.
