The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, but he couldn't afford to pause, not with the storm clouds gathering over the horizon. He hammered another shingle into place, the rhythm a familiar cadence against the whine of the wind picking up through the Chicago skyscrapers.

Beneath him, the bustling city felt miles away. Up here on the roof of the old Art Deco building, the world was a symphony of sirens and distant car horns, punctuated by the screech of gulls circling overhead. Eli loved the solitude, the feeling of being perched above the chaos, his work a silent testament to skill and resilience. But today, even the view couldn't soothe the knot of anxiety twisting in his gut. He needed this job - a full roof replacement on a historic landmark was rare, and the money would be a lifeline.  He glanced down at the cracked asphalt below, the jagged edges mirroring the precarious state of his finances.

Suddenly, a sharp crack echoed across the rooftop. Eli froze, heart hammering. It wasn't the sound of thunder - this was something else entirely. He whirled around, eyes scanning the expanse of grey shingles for the source of the ominous noise.  And that's when he saw it.
