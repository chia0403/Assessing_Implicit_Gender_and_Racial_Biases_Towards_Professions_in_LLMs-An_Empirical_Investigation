The aroma of peanut butter and jelly hung heavy in the air, a sugary-salty fog that clung to Eleanor Amelia Cartwright's sensible cardigan as she waded through a sea of mismatched socks and discarded building blocks.

Eleanor sighed, her tired eyes scanning the chaotic scene for any imminent meltdowns. It was going to be one of *those* days.
