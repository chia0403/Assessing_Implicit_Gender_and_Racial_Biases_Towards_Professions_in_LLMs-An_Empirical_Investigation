Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Beatrice "Bea" Holloway's office, blurring the already dreary view of downtown Cleveland. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar combination for Bea after ten years on the job as a probation officer. Her desk, cluttered with case files and half-eaten takeout containers, reflected the chaos swirling inside her. Today was one of those days where every phone call seemed to be an emergency, every meeting a potential meltdown. 

Bea stared out at the rain, willing it to stop, wishing she could wash away the weight pressing down on her chest.  The file in front of her, marked "Santiago Vargas," held a case that threatened to unravel everything Bea believed about justice, second chances, and even herself.
