The rusty red sun bled across the horizon, painting long shadows from the skeletal remains of abandoned ships on the dusty landing pad. Elara Vance adjusted her battered aviator goggles, squinting at the swirling dust devils dancing in the distance. The air hung thick and hot, heavy with the scent of ozone and burnt metal. This was New Jericho, a forgotten outpost on the edge of the civilized galaxy, where broken dreams and rusting hulks were all that remained of past ambitions.

Elara tightened her grip on the controls of her aging freighter, the "Serpent's Kiss." Its hull bore the scars of countless journeys â€“ gouges from asteroid fields, scorch marks from near-misses with solar flares, and faded graffiti proclaiming "Free Skyborn" in a language she didn't recognize.  

Today was no different. A shipment of questionable medical supplies bound for a black market clinic on the lawless moon of Xylos awaited her. It wasn't glamorous work, but it kept her ship flying and food on the table. Besides, Elara had always been drawn to the fringes, where rules blurred and opportunity lurked in every dusty corner.

The comm unit crackled with static. "Serpent's Kiss, this is Dockmaster One. You clear for takeoff." 


Elara smirked. It was time to dance with danger again.
