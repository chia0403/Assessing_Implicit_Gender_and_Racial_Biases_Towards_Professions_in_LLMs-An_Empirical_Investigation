Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude’s Rehabilitation Center, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionist painting of grays and golds. The air inside smelled faintly of disinfectant and stale coffee, a familiar scent to Elara Rosalind Hayes, the center's newest occupational therapist.  

Elara, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a practical braid, surveyed her first patient’s chart. Henry Davenport, 68, stroke survivor, struggling with fine motor skills and speech. A tremor ran through Elara's hand as she flipped through the pages, the weight of responsibility settling onto her shoulders like an invisible cloak.  She wasn't just helping Henry regain lost function; she was aiding him in reclaiming his life.

Taking a deep breath, Elara squared her shoulders and entered Henry's room. The afternoon light filtering through the window cast long shadows across the sterile white walls. Henry sat slumped in a wheelchair, his gaze fixed on a point beyond Elara’s reach. His face was etched with frustration, mirroring the internal struggle she knew he was facing.
