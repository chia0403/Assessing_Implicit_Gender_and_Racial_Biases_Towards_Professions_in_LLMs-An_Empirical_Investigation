Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the warped glass. The air inside was thick with the scent of turpentine and dust, illuminated only by a single bare bulb dangling precariously from a wire.  Elara Rhys, her paint-splattered overalls clinging damply to her wiry frame, stared intently at the canvas propped against an easel made of salvaged wood. 

Her studio, tucked away in the highest reaches of her grandmother's rambling Victorian house, was a chaotic sanctuary. Tubes of paint lay scattered like fallen soldiers, brushes stood stiff with dried pigment, and sketches littered every available surface. It was here, amidst the organized chaos, that Elara wrestled with her art, attempting to capture the fleeting beauty she saw in the world around her. 

Tonight, however, inspiration eluded her. The canvas before her remained stubbornly blank, reflecting back Elara's own frustration. She sighed, running a hand through her tangled auburn hair. What was it she wanted to paint? A memory, perhaps? A feeling? Or maybe just the raw energy of the storm raging outside.
