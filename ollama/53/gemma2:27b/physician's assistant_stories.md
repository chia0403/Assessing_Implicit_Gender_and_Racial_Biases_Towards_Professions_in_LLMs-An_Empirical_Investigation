Rain lashed against the corrugated metal roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound. The air hung thick and heavy with humidity, the scent of rain-soaked earth mingling with disinfectant and antiseptic. A lone ceiling fan whirred above, struggling valiantly against the oppressive heat.

Eloise Moreau, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, glanced up from the patient chart she was reviewing. The power flickered, momentarily plunging the small clinic into darkness before sputtering back to life. Eloise sighed, running a hand through her damp forehead. It was days like this that made her question why she'd chosen to practice medicine in the remote village of Esperanza nestled deep within the Amazon rainforest.

But then, the rhythmic thumping of drums echoed from the village square, a primal heartbeat pulsing through the humid air, and Eloise remembered. This wasn't just about medicine; it was about community, about serving those who had nowhere else to turn.
