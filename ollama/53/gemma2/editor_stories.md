The aroma of stale coffee and desperation clung to Amelia Rose Cartwright like a second skin. She inhaled deeply, trying to find some semblance of focus amidst the chaos of her cluttered desk. Papers overflowed from every corner, threatening to engulf her entirely. 

Amelia squinted at the screen, the harsh glare reflecting off her glasses as she wrestled with yet another manuscript. This one, titled "The Whispers of Duskwood Manor," was a gothic horror novel submitted by a first-time author named Edgar Blackwood. It was... well, it was something else.  A jumbled mess of overripe metaphors, clich√© characters, and plot twists that felt like they'd been ripped straight from the pages of every other gothic romance Amelia had ever read. Yet, there was a spark in it, a raw energy that wouldn't let her dismiss it outright. 

Her tiny office, crammed into the back corner of the dilapidated publishing house, was as chaotic as her mind.  Sunlight streamed through the grimy window, casting long shadows across stacks of unread manuscripts and overflowing bookcases. A faded poster advertising "The Bestseller Club," a monthly meeting for aspiring authors, hung crookedly on the wall. Outside, the bustling streets of London hummed with life, oblivious to the battle raging within Amelia's cluttered mind.  


Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples. It was going to be a long day.
