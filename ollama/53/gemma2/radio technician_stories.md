The humid Louisiana air hung heavy in Reginald "Reggie" Beaumont's workshop, thick with the scent of soldering flux and old coffee. The single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling cast long, distorted shadows across tools laid out on his workbench: a multimeter humming softly, a coil of copper wire glinting in the dim light, a disassembled transistor radio begging to be resurrected. Reggie himself was hunched over a particularly stubborn receiver, his brow furrowed in concentration as he traced the faulty circuit board with a nimble finger. 

Outside, the rhythmic rumble of a distant train echoed through the swamp-grass choked fields that surrounded his rickety shack, a familiar soundtrack to Reggie's solitary life. The year was 1957, and the world beyond this patch of rural Louisiana pulsed with the promise of change: rock and roll music was taking over the airwaves, television sets were becoming commonplace in even the humblest homes, and Sputnik had just launched into space, a metallic reminder that the future was hurtling towards them at an alarming pace.  But here in Reggie's workshop, time seemed to move differently, measured only by the tick of his grandfather clock and the crackle of static on the airwaves he so meticulously repaired.
