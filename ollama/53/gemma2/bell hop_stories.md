The Grand Budapest Hotel shimmered under the sickly yellow streetlights, its ornate facade a pale echo of its former glory. Rain slicked the cobblestone streets, turning them into treacherous mirrors reflecting the city's weary soul. Inside, amidst the hushed murmurings and clinking champagne glasses, was Bartholomew "Bart" Copperbottom, the youngest bellhop in the hotel's 100-year history.

Bart wasn't much to look at. Small and wiry with a mop of perpetually bedraggled brown hair, he often felt invisible amidst the grandeur of his surroundings. Yet, Bart possessed an uncanny knack for remembering faces, names, and even the subtle cues that betrayed a guest's mood. He navigated the hotel like a spider in its web, anticipating needs before they were voiced, and carrying secrets like whispered prayers in the dead of night. Tonight, however, was different. A chill, sharper than the autumn air, settled over Bart as he received his first assignment for the evening â€“ to deliver a single crimson envelope to room 309.  The recipient? Madame Evangeline Bellerose, a woman shrouded in whispers and rumored to be more dangerous than any viper.


Bart's heart hammered against his ribs like a trapped bird. This was no ordinary delivery.  This was the start of something...else. Something that might just change everything for him.
