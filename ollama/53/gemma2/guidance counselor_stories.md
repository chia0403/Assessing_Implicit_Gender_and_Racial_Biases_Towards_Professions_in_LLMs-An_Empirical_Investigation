The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cluttered desk in front of her. Papers overflowed from trays, forming precarious stacks threatened by the slightest tremor.  A chipped mug filled with lukewarm coffee sat abandoned beside a textbook titled "Understanding Adolescent Angst," its pages dog-eared and underlined with frantic notes. Eleanor sighed, rubbing her temples, feeling the familiar ache that came with trying to navigate the emotional minefield of high school guidance counseling at William H. McKinley High. It wasn't just the constant parade of anxieties, insecurities, and first heartbreaks – though those were plentiful enough – it was the overwhelming sense that she was constantly playing catch-up. 

The bell shrieked, marking the end of lunch period, and a gaggle of giggling girls flooded into her office, their chatter momentarily drowning out the hum of the lights. Eleanor plastered on a smile, bracing herself for whatever drama this particular trio had cooked up – a stolen boyfriend, a fight over the Homecoming court, or perhaps a whispered rumor about who snuck extra fries from the cafeteria. 


As the girls settled into her mismatched chairs, Eleanor took a deep breath, hoping to find some semblance of order in the chaos that was her life as guidance counselor extraordinaire.  After all, even the most chaotic day could be salvaged with a listening ear and a well-placed piece of advice.
