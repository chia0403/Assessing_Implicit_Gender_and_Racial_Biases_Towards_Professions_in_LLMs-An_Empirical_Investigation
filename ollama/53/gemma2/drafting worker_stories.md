The whine of the blueprint rollers echoed through the cavernous hall, a familiar lullaby to Amelia Beatrice Finch's ears. Dust motes danced in the weak rays of sunlight filtering through grimy skylights, illuminating rows upon rows of metal drafting tables, each occupied by a hunched figure bent over their work. Amelia, her knuckles white against the worn oak of her table, squinted at the complex diagram before her. It was for a new bridge design, commissioned by Lord Hawthorne himself – a prestigious project, to be sure, but one that had already swallowed countless sleepless nights and gallons of lukewarm coffee. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of stale ink and graphite, punctuated occasionally by the acrid tang of soldering from the workshop down the hall. Outside, London hummed with its usual chaotic symphony: horse-drawn carriages clattering over cobblestones, hawkers' cries echoing through the streets, and the distant rumble of industrial machinery churning out the city's endless supply of steel and steam. But here, in the dimly lit drafting room of Hawthorne & Sons, time seemed to move at a different pace – measured by the meticulous strokes of the lead pencil and the relentless ticking of the grandfather clock that hung like a silent judge over their collective labor.
