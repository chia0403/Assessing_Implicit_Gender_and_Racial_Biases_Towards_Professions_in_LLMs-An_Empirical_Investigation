The sun was just beginning to bleed over the Texas plains, casting long shadows from the abandoned gas station that served as Dalton "Rusty" McCready's temporary home for the night.  He leaned back in his worn leather truck seat, the stale air thick with the scent of diesel and coffee. Rusty’s CB crackled to life, a familiar voice cutting through the morning quiet.

"Big Rig Red coming through, anyone out there?" 

Rusty reached for his mug, lukewarm coffee sloshing against the chipped ceramic.  

“Rusty here,” he replied, his voice rough from days of hauling freight across the endless expanse of highway. “Just finishing up a cup before I hit the road again.”

He squinted at the sunrise, its fiery orange reflecting off the dusty windshield. Another day, another haul.  Another chance to outrun the ghosts that haunted him back home in Amarillo.


This was Rusty's life - a constant rumble of the engine, endless stretches of asphalt ribboning before him, and the comforting hum of loneliness.
