The siren wailed, a mournful cry swallowed by the roaring traffic on I-95. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the neon signs that flickered in the distance like dying embers. Inside the ambulance, Amelia "Amy"  Hayes held the EKG monitor close, her eyes glued to the erratic rhythm flickering across its screen. Her partner, a seasoned EMT named Ben, barked orders into his radio, relaying their location and vital stats of the patient, a young woman with a gash on her forehead bleeding profusely.

They were en route to Mercy General, a sprawling hospital in Baltimore known for its bustling ER and dedicated staff, but tonight felt different. A tension hung thick in the air, fueled by the storm raging outside and the urgency of their mission.  The radio crackled again, Benâ€™s voice tight with concern: "Ambulance 12-Alpha responding to possible multiple victims at construction site. ETA five minutes."

Amy's heart pounded against her ribs, a drumbeat echoing the insistent siren. The construction site incident was an unwelcome addition to their already stressful night. She glanced at the young woman in her care, hoping they could reach Mercy General in time. This storm, she knew, threatened to unleash something far more chaotic than just rain and wind.
