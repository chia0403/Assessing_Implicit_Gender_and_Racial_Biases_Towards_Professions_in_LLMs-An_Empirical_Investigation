The stale scent of disinfectant and despair hung heavy in Amelia Grace Blackwood's nostrils as she pushed open the door to Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s apartment. Sunlight slanted through dusty windows, illuminating a scene of chaotic grief: overturned furniture, scattered photographs, and a forlorn cat curled up on a pile of blankets.  

Amelia, a woman whose meticulously coiffed blonde bob and impeccably tailored suits could have made even a funeral feel slightly elegant, forced a smile. "Mrs. Henderson? I'm Amelia Blackwood, your insurance agent." 


The setting: A dilapidated apartment building in the faded grandeur of New Orleans. The once vibrant French Quarter had become increasingly rundown in recent years, a bittersweet reflection of the city's struggle to hold onto its past amidst the relentless tides of progress. The air was thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine, a constant reminder of the beauty that could still be found amongst the decay.
