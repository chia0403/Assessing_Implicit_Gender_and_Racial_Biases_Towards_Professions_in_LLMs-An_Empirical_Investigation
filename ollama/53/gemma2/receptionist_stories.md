The bell above the door tinkled with an unwelcome cheerfulness as another Tuesday morning visitor stepped into Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's cluttered office.  Evelyn Primrose, her fingers twitching nervously against the worn leather of her desk, watched them from behind her thick glasses. Her nametag, a faded plastic rectangle pinned crookedly to her cardigan, read simply "Evelyn."

Dr. Blackwood's practice, nestled between a dusty bookstore and a laundromat on Elm Street, was hardly glamorous.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and overripe lilies â€“ a perpetual bouquet Dr. Blackwood swore brought "good energy," but which Evelyn found more akin to an oppressive fog. The waiting area, crammed with mismatched armchairs and magazines from the early nineties, was perpetually littered with forgotten tissues and crumpled appointment cards. 

Evelyn longed for something else, something beyond the endless cycle of ringing phones, barking dogs on leashes, and Dr. Blackwood's eccentric pronouncements about crystals and chakras.  But until she found it, she would keep her smile plastered on, answer the phone in a voice that never betrayed her boredom, and hope that today wouldn't be quite as dreary as yesterday.
