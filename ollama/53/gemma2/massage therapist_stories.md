The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of chamomile tea steeping on the counter. Outside, the late October wind rattled the windows of "Serene Touch," Amelia Beatrice Thorne's cozy little massage therapy practice nestled in a leafy corner of Boston. 

Amelia adjusted her jade-green scrub top, smoothing out a wrinkle before peering at the clock. It was almost time for Mr. Henderson, a regular client with chronic back pain who always seemed to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders, both literally and metaphorically. A warm wave of empathy washed over Amelia as she envisioned him slumped in her waiting room chair, his face etched with worry lines. 


She loved this part of her job â€“ the quiet anticipation before a session began, the chance to create a sanctuary where worries could melt away like stress knots under her skilled hands. Tonight, though, something felt different. The air hummed with an unfamiliar energy, and Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that tonight's session would be anything but ordinary.
