The flickering neon sign outside "Grimes & Gibbons, Attorneys at Law" cast an eerie green glow on Amelia Josephine "Amy" Parker's tired face as she unlocked the door for the night. The humid July air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and simmering legal battles. Inside, the office was a tomb of silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic hum of the antiquated HVAC system struggling to keep pace with the oppressive heat. Papers were strewn across desks like fallen leaves, testament to another long day spent wading through contracts, motions, and depositions. 

Amy sighed, her shoulders slumping as she flipped on the light in the paralegal bullpen. This was her nightly ritual: shutting down the office, silencing the ghosts of lost cases and whispered arguments, and leaving behind the world of high-stakes legal drama. At least until morning.
