Outside, the bustling city of New Orleans pulsed with life, a vibrant tapestry of music, laughter, and hurried footsteps, but inside Eloiseâ€™s haven, time seemed to move at its own languid pace.  She was lost in her world, a world woven from thread and dreams, where every stitch held a story waiting to be told.
