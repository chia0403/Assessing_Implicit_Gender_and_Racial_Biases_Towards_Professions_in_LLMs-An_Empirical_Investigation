The bell above Amelia "Amy" Brightwood's door chimed, announcing her first client of the day. Amy sighed contentedly as she glanced at the sunny corner of her small Brooklyn apartment where she'd set up her makeshift nutrition counseling space. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the mismatched collection of plants she'd nurtured into thriving greenery and casting dappled patterns on the hand-painted wall mural depicting a vibrant fruit basket bursting with life. Outside, the city hummed with its usual frenetic energy, but within these walls, there was peace - a sanctuary for people seeking to nourish their bodies and minds. 

Today, however, Amy felt an unusual tension prickling at her skin. It wasn't the usual pre-client jitters; it was something deeper, a sense of foreboding she couldn't quite place. She straightened her floral apron, took a deep breath, and plastered on her most welcoming smile. 


The door creaked open, revealing a woman with tight lips and wary eyes.
