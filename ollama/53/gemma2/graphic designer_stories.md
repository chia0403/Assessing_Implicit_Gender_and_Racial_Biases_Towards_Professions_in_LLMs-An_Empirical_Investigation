The stale scent of coffee clung to Amelia "Amy" Thorne's worn-out design hoodie like a second skin. Outside her window, the neon glow of Times Square bled into the pre-dawn darkness, casting an electric blue pallor over the bustling city that never slept. Amy, however, felt decidedly uninspired. Her laptop screen reflected back at her the tired rings under her eyes and the messy bun atop her head – a testament to the all-nighter she'd just pulled for Mr. Bigshot CEO's "revolutionary" new marketing campaign, which essentially amounted to rearranging the font on his existing logo.

The cramped studio apartment was Amy’s sanctuary, filled with the comforting chaos of art supplies and half-finished projects. Postcards from her travels – Tokyo, Paris, Havana – covered one wall like a personal tapestry, each reminding her of the vibrant world beyond the confines of corporate design briefs. But right now, the only color she saw was the pixelated blue of her screen, devoid of the vibrancy that used to fuel her passion.  

She sighed, pushing back from the desk and rubbing her temples. Perhaps a walk through the city before dawn would clear her head. Maybe amidst the pre-awakening hum of the city, she’d find a spark of inspiration, something more than just another corporate logo rehash.
