The scent of construction paper and crayons hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic thump of tiny hammers nailing popsicle sticks together. 

Miss Amelia Grace Hawthorne surveyed her kingdom with a practiced eye. Her classroom, affectionately dubbed "The Enchanted Forest" by its five-year inhabitants, was a riot of color and chaos. Butterflies crafted from paper plates fluttered on walls adorned with hand-painted rainbows, while a papier-mâché volcano loomed ominously in the corner, patiently awaiting its next eruption (hopefully not during nap time). 

Amelia smiled. Despite the occasional meltdowns and misplaced glue sticks, this was her happy place. Her tiny charges, each one a unique spark of wonder, were her greatest joy. Today, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, as if an unseen force was watching them all. 


Amelia dismissed it as nerves; after all, today was the annual "Fairy Garden" show-and-tell. But as she glanced around the room, she couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to unfold.
