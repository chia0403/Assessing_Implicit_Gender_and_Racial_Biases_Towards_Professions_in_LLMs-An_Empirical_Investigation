The air in Amelia Clementine's studio was thick with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine, a familiar perfume that both comforted and suffocated her. The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty window, casting long shadows across the canvases leaning against the walls, each one a testament to Amelia's struggle. Her latest piece, a portrait of her grandmother in her youth, lay unfinished on the easel, its subject staring back with an accusing gaze. 

Amelia lived and breathed in this attic space above her aunt’s bookstore in the heart of Edinburgh. The city itself was a constant source of inspiration – the weathered cobblestone streets, the gothic grandeur of the castle looming over the rooftops, the vibrant energy of the bustling Royal Mile. But today, Amelia couldn't find any inspiration amidst the chaos of paint tubes and brushes scattered across her workbench. Her frustration simmered, threatening to boil over.  


The city outside hummed with life, oblivious to Amelia's artistic drought.
