The scent of antiseptic and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Beatrice Sinclair.  Sunlight streamed through the skylights of Willowbrook Rehabilitation Center, casting long shadows across the bustling activity on the therapy floor.  Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, moved with practiced ease between patients, a warm smile on her face. Today was busy; stroke rehabilitation sessions, hand exercises for arthritis, and gait training for post-surgical recovery filled Amelia's schedule. 

But as she adjusted the weights on a pulley system for Mrs. Peterson, her keen eyes caught movement at the edge of the room. A man, tall and broad-shouldered, stood hunched against the wall, his back turned. He seemed out of place in the bright, airy space, shrouded in an air of quiet sadness.  His presence was a discordant note in Amelia's carefully orchestrated symphony of healing. 


Ameliaâ€™s curiosity piqued, she set aside Mrs. Peterson's exercise and approached the stranger cautiously. "Excuse me," she said gently, her voice soft but firm, "Can I help you?"  The man turned slowly, his face etched with weariness, a deep scar tracing its way across his left cheek. He looked at Amelia, his blue eyes filled with a mixture of defiance and despair. 


"I think," he rasped, his voice rough as gravel, "I need your help."
