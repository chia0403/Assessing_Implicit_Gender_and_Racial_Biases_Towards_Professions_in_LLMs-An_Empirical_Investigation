The rain hammered on the corrugated iron roof like a thousand tiny fists, each blow rattling the bones of Samuel Alistair Finch's aging office building. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. 

Sam, as he preferred to be called, hunched over his desk, its surface cluttered with files marked "Missing," "Unsolved," and "Dead End." A stray cigarette butt smoldered in a chipped porcelain ashtray, casting flickering shadows on the worn photograph pinned to his bulletin board: a smiling woman with bright green eyes and a mischievous grin. Sarah - the only case he hadn't closed.

The door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and a young woman soaked to the bone. Her auburn hair clung to her face, dripping onto the faded floral rug. Sam glanced up, taking in her trembling lips and wide, haunted eyes.  


"Mr. Finch?" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the relentless drumming of the rain. "I need your help."
