The greasy spoon diner reeked of coffee and desperation, two smells Sergeant Amelia "Amy" Harper knew intimately. Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Memphis was the color of bruised plums, promising another day of sticky humidity and simmering tensions.  Amy sat hunched over a lukewarm mug, her hand resting on the worn leather of her holster. Across from her, a thin stream of coffee seeped out of a chipped cup held by Frankie "Pops" Malone, a man whose face bore the map of a life lived hard and loud. 

"She was gone when I woke up," Pops said, his voice gravelly like gravel rolling down a tin roof.  "Just vanished."

Amy took a long swallow of coffee, its bitterness matching the taste in her mouth. This wasn't just another missing person case in the River City. This was personal.
