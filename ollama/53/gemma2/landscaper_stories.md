The humid Georgia air hung heavy as Elias Thorne adjusted his worn straw hat, sweat trickling down his temple despite the early morning hour.  A symphony of cicadas buzzed in the sprawling oak trees that lined the manicured lawns he was responsible for maintaining. The scent of freshly cut grass mingled with the pungent aroma of honeysuckle climbing the white picket fences that encircled each pristine yard in this affluent Atlanta suburb. 

Elias squinted at the blueprints spread across his knee, a frown etching itself onto his weathered face.  This wasn't just another day of mowing and trimming; this was Mrs. Hawthorne's garden â€“ an expanse of meticulously planned floral arrangements and topiaries that demanded a level of precision Elias usually reserved for his own, more whimsical creations back home in rural Georgia. 


The weight of her expectations pressed down on him as he surveyed the seemingly endless rows of vibrant petunias, their purple blooms drooping slightly in the morning heat. He knew Mrs. Hawthorne wouldn't tolerate anything less than perfection.
