The air in the ER was thick with the scent of antiseptic and anxiety. Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the flurry of activity.  Amelia Claire Bennett, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously cleaned a jagged wound on a young boy’s knee. He whimpered softly, clutching his teddy bear. Amelia murmured soothing words, her voice calm and steady despite the chaotic symphony of beeps, shouts, and gurneys rolling down the hallway. 

The ER at Mercy General Hospital was always a whirlwind, but tonight felt especially intense. A string of car accidents had overwhelmed the staff, leaving even seasoned physicians like Dr. Lee looking harried and sleep-deprived. Amelia, however, thrived in the pressure cooker environment. She loved the immediacy of it all, the adrenaline rush that came with patching up broken bodies and soothing frazzled minds. 

This particular night, though, something felt different. A sense of unease prickled at her skin, a feeling she couldn't shake off despite the familiar routine.  As Amelia finished bandaging the boy’s wound, her gaze drifted towards the waiting room, where a lone figure sat shrouded in shadow, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. They seemed out of place amidst the worried families and anxious patients, radiating an unsettling stillness that sent a shiver down Amelia's spine.
