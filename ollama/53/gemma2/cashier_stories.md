The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the aisles of the Discount Den. It was past midnight, and the store was eerily quiet save for the low thrum of the refrigerators and the occasional sigh of the ancient air conditioning unit. Amy tapped her fingernails on the chipped countertop, her gaze fixed on the clock ticking relentlessly towards 2:00 AM â€“ her shift's end. The Discount Den was a haven for misfits and bargain hunters alike, its shelves crammed with dusty relics and discounted dreams. It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills. 

A bell chimed, breaking the silence as the door creaked open. A tall figure, cloaked in shadows, stepped inside, sending a shiver down Amy's spine.  The night had taken on an unsettling edge.
