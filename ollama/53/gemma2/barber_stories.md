Bartholomew "Bart" Quillington expertly wielded his scissors, snipping away at Mr. Henderson's unruly sideburns. Bart’s small shop nestled on the corner of Maple and Elm, a quiet haven amidst the bustle of downtown Harmony Creek. 

His worn leather barber chair creaked gently as Mr. Henderson shifted, the rhythmic whir of the clippers the only other sound besides the steady patter of raindrops drumming against the dusty windows.  Bart paused, tilting his head to catch the glint of lightning in the distance, a jagged flash that illuminated the rows of antique shaving mugs lining the wall.

"Storm's coming in fast," he said, more to himself than Mr. Henderson. "Best be getting home soon."


Harmony Creek was a town perpetually teetering between sleepy charm and unsettling secrets. Today, it felt decidedly on the verge of something bigger, a feeling that prickled at Bart’s skin even through the familiar warmth of his shop.  But right now, all that mattered was Mr. Henderson's unruly mustache.  After all, every storm needed its calm center.
