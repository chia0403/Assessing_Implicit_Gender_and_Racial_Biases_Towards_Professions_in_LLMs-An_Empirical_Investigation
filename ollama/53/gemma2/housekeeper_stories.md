The scent of lavender clung to Elara Beatrice Finch like a second skin. It was her weapon against the musty odors that permeated the grand old manor.  She moved through the dimly lit halls, humming softly as she polished the silver in the dining room. Each glint reflected a faint light from the single bulb hanging precariously above, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness.

The Manor of Whispering Pines was more a collection of memories than a home these days. Since the death of Lord Alistair Finch a year ago, it had fallen silent, save for the creaks and groans of its aged timbers. Elara, who had served the Finch family faithfully for twenty years, remained as the sole inhabitant.  Her days were spent in a careful choreography of cleaning, tending the neglected garden, and keeping vigil over the ghosts that whispered through the halls. 


Elara paused, her hand hovering over a tarnished silver tray. A faint chill ran down her spine, prickling at the back of her neck. The scent of lavender suddenly felt too thin, insufficient to ward off whatever unseen presence had just brushed against her.
