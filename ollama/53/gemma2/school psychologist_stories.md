The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Blackwood's head like a chorus of anxious bees, their buzzing echoing the nervous energy thrumming in her veins. The air in the small, windowless office felt thick with unspoken anxieties, a blend of stale coffee and lingering teenage angst. A worn rug patterned with faded sunflowers did little to soften the stark beige walls, adorned with motivational posters that seemed to leer down at Elara from their plastic frames. 

Elara ran a hand through her dark, unruly curls, trying to calm the tremor in her fingertips. She was no stranger to this scene: the cramped office, the hushed anxieties, the weight of teenage problems settling on her shoulders like an unwelcome cloak.  But today felt different. Today, the air crackled with a tension she couldn't quite place, a premonition that hung heavy like a storm cloud. 

She glanced at the name on the file folder lying open before her: *Thomas Riley*. The boyâ€™s parents had requested a meeting after an alarming downward spiral in his grades and behavior. He was described as withdrawn, erratic, and plagued by nightmares. 


Elara took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead. She was Elara Blackwood, school psychologist, and she was here to help.
