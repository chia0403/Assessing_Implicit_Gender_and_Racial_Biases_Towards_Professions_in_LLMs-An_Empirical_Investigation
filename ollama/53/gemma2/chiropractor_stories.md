The rhythmic chirp of crickets punctuated the humid Florida night as Dr. Amelia Claire Hawthorne adjusted her stethoscope around her neck. Sweat clung to her back despite the AC blasting inside her office.  It was 9:30 PM, well past closing time, but Amelia's dedication to her patients knew no bounds. She had a reputation for treating even those who couldn't afford her standard rates, often offering sliding scales and late-night appointments. The flickering neon sign outside, proclaiming "Hawthorne Chiropractic - Where Life Finds Balance," cast an almost ethereal glow on the dusty asphalt parking lot. Inside, the small office was cluttered with mismatched furniture and anatomical charts, smelling faintly of lavender essential oil and liniment. 

Amelia glanced at the lone patient waiting in her dimly lit reception area: a young woman, pale and slumped in a chair, clutching a worn teddy bear to her chest. Amelia knew her story by heart - chronic pain from an accident, mounting medical bills, and a desperate plea for relief. She hoped she could help.


This was just the beginning of Amelia's night.
