The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Amelia Brightwell's head, casting a sterile glow over her instruments. Her small office, nestled on the corner of Elm Street in a quiet suburban town called Maplewood, was almost unbearably clean. Each chair gleamed like a freshly polished pearl, and the smell of antiseptic hung thick in the air, mingling with a faint scent of lavender essential oil from the diffuser in the corner.

Amelia ran a hand through her neatly pulled-back hair, sighing as she gazed at the empty waiting room. It was 8:45 am, and she was already running late. Her appointment with Mr. Henderson, the grumpy old man who insisted on chewing gum while getting his teeth cleaned, had taken an unexpected turn when he'd decided to launch into a tirade about the price of tomatoes at the local market.

The clock ticked past nine, each second amplifying Amelia’s growing sense of dread. She was already behind schedule, and the rest of her day promised more of the same -  a symphony of drilling, probing, and forced smiles. But today felt different, heavier somehow. As if something else, lurking beneath the surface of routine, awaited her in the shadows of Maplewood’s quaint normalcy.
