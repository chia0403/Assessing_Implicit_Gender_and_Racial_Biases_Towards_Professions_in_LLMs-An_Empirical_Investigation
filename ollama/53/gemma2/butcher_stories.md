The air in Bartholomew “Bart” Butcher’s shop hung thick with the scent of iron and juniper, a familiar perfume he'd worn like a second skin for thirty years. The grime-stained walls of "Bart's Best Cuts" were adorned with faded hunting trophies - a buck with antlers that scraped the ceiling, a boar with tusks long enough to spear a man, and a wolf, its eyes perpetually locked on the door as if daring any customer to enter. 

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn butcher block, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the wind howled through the barren trees lining Maple Street, rattling the windows of Bart's shop like skeletal fingers. He stood behind the counter, his hands calloused and strong, meticulously trimming a slab of beef, the rhythmic rasp of his knife against bone a steady counterpoint to the storm brewing outside.  

Bart knew every cut of meat, every twitch of muscle in each carcass that graced his countertop. It was more than a job; it was an art form, a conversation between man and beast, a primal connection he'd cultivated since he was a boy apprenticing under his father. 


But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up the back of Bart's neck, a sense of unease that had nothing to do with the approaching storm. He glanced at the old clock on the wall; it was almost closing time.  Then he noticed it – a single red feather, shimmering crimson against the worn wood of his counter, like a drop of blood in an ocean of grey.
