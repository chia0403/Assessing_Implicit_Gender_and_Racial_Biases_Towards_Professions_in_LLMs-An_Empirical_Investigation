The smell of day-old Cheerios and crayon shavings hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender hand sanitiser. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Rainbow Room Preschool, casting long, wavering shadows across the brightly coloured walls adorned with finger-painted masterpieces and paper chains strung haphazardly by sticky little hands. 

Amelia "Amy" Roseberry sighed, leaning against the edge of the miniature playhouse – a cardboard box castle that had seen better days – as she surveyed the chaos. Three toddlers were engaged in a particularly ferocious battle over a mismatched pair of purple mittens, while another two sat quietly in the corner, meticulously building a tower out of blocks that seemed destined to topple at any moment.  

Amy loved working with children, truly she did. Their boundless energy and unwavering curiosity filled her days with laughter and wonder. But sometimes, just sometimes, like this particular Tuesday morning, the sheer force of their tiny chaos threatened to overwhelm even her most patient spirit.
