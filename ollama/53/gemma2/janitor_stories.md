The stale scent of bleach hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint whiff of old coffee and something vaguely metallic that Agnes perpetually struggled to identify. The rhythmic squeak of her mop against the linoleum floor was the only sound breaking the oppressive silence of the abandoned university library.  

Agnes Pearl Bartholomew, a woman whose age was as elusive as the answers she sought in the dusty tomes on forgotten shelves, surveyed the scene with a sigh. Moonlight streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating swirling dust motes and casting long shadows that danced like phantoms across the silent rows of bookshelves. 

Outside, the first whispers of dawn crept over the city, heralding another day for Agnes. Another day spent cleaning up after the intellectual elite who had once frequented these halls, their minds buzzing with ideas now as faded as the ink on many of the library's aging volumes.
