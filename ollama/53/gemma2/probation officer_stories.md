The air in Brenda Evelyn Davenport's car hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and regret. She gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the worn leather, as she navigated the pothole-ridden streets of Southside. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already faded neon signs that lined the street like forgotten promises. 

Brenda pulled up to a rundown apartment building, its chipped paint peeling like sunburnt skin. The flickering orange light from a lone porch lamp cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt parking lot. This was her third visit to this address today, each time finding an empty apartment and a growing sense of unease about the man she was tasked with supervising: Kevin Oâ€™Malley, a young ex-convict recently released for petty theft. 

Brenda was known among her peers as "The Retriever," for her uncanny ability to track down even the most elusive probationers. But this time, something felt different. A gnawing anxiety twisted in her gut, whispering that Kevin wasn't just avoiding his mandatory check-in; he was trying to disappear.
