The textbooks lay open on desks, their pages mockingly pristine against the backdrop of unfulfilled potential.  Eleanor glanced at the clock – 2:45 pm. Freedom was a mere fifteen minutes away.

Eleanor longed for the days when they hung on her every word, eager to dissect ancient battles or unravel the tangled threads of past events.
