The scent of rain-soaked earth clung to Amelia Hawthorne's coat as she stepped into the waiting room. A worn floral rug muffled the rhythmic tap of her heels against the wooden floor, a counterpoint to the gentle jazz melody emanating from a vintage record player tucked in the corner. Sunlight slanted through stained glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across faded armchairs and overflowing bookshelves. 

Amelia adjusted her spectacles, smoothing down the unruly curls that escaped from beneath her navy blue knit cap. Her appointment was early – eight o'clock sharp – but she’d seen enough mornings to know patients often ran late. Besides, this wasn’t just any morning. Today was Amelia’s first day back at Willow Creek Counseling Center after a year-long sabbatical, and the familiar weight of responsibility felt both comforting and daunting. 


The waiting room itself seemed to echo with memories – whispers of past anxieties shared, triumphs celebrated, tears shed. It was a space where stories unfolded, one vulnerability at a time. Amelia’s heart ached with a mixture of anticipation and apprehension as she took a deep breath, the scent of old paper and sandalwood filling her lungs.  She was ready to listen.
