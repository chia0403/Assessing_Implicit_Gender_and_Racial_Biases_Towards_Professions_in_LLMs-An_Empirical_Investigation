The morning sun hadn't yet crested the mesa when Jeremiah "Red" McAlister squinted out at his herd.  A thin veil of mist clung to the valley floor, obscuring the details of the grazing cattle below. He breathed in deeply, the crisp air biting at his lungs and carrying the scent of sagebrush and dew-soaked grass. This was home. The sprawling expanse of the Painted Desert Ranch, inherited from his grandfather, was more than just land; it was a legacy woven into the very fabric of Red's being. His weathered face, etched with lines that spoke of long days under the unforgiving sun, reflected the quiet strength of the land itself.  The distant rumble of thunder echoed across the valley, a stark reminder of the ever-present threat of summer storms in this arid landscape. 


Red adjusted his worn Stetson, casting a weary glance towards the horizon. He knew trouble was brewing, both on the plains and within himself. The drought had tightened its grip on the land, pushing his herd to their limit. And then there was the new landowner, Ethan Thorne, who'd bought up the neighboring property with promises of progress that Red suspected masked a darker agenda. This year, survival wouldn't just be about managing the cattle; it would be about protecting everything he held dear.
