The smoky air hung heavy in The Blue Moon Saloon, clinging to Elara Nightingale's sequined dress like a second skin.  Her fingers nervously tapped out a rhythm against the worn mahogany bar top as she surveyed the dimly lit room. A haze of cigarette smoke swirled around a handful of patrons hunched over their drinks, barely registering her presence. It was Tuesday night at The Blue Moon â€“ prime time for washed-up cowboys and disillusioned dreamers, neither of whom cared much for an up-and-coming songbird like Elara. 

She had been playing these gigs for months now, hoping to catch the ear of someone, anyone, who might believe in her talent. But tonight felt different.  A prickle of anticipation danced along her spine, fueled by a whispered rumour she'd heard earlier: a scout from Nashville was supposedly in the house, looking for fresh faces. Elara took a deep breath, tasting the bittersweet tang of whiskey and regret on her tongue. This could be her chance, but first, she had to face the crowd, their indifference a silent judge waiting to pronounce her success or failure.
