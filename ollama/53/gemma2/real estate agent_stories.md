The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass.  Sweat prickled at Amelia “Amy” Rose Butterfield's hairline as she navigated the cracked asphalt driveway of the dilapidated Victorian on Elm Street. It wasn't exactly the kind of property that typically graced her social media feed, where perfectly staged homes bathed in sunshine were the norm. But Amy was a realtor for the forgotten corners of Savannah – the houses with peeling paint and overgrown gardens, whispering stories of past grandeur and current neglect. 

This one, she suspected, held more than just dust bunnies and creaky floorboards. A chill ran down her spine as she reached the porch, drawn by an unsettling silence that seemed to pulsate from within the house's shadowed depths. This wasn't your typical "needs some TLC" fixer-upper; this was a whispered invitation into something… different.
