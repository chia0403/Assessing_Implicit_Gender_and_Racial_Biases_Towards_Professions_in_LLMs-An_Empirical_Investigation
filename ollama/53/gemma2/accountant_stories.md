The aroma of burnt toast filled Bartholomew Quentin Fitzwilliam's tiny apartment, jolting him from his daydream. He cursed under his breath, scrambling to unplug the toaster before it set off the smoke alarm again.  Bartholomew, or Bart as he preferred (though no one really did), was an accountant for a mid-sized firm specializing in tax law. While most people considered his profession dull and predictable, Bart found solace in the meticulous dance of numbers, each transaction a puzzle piece contributing to a larger picture. 

His apartment, however, was anything but orderly.  Boxes overflowing with paperwork lined the shelves, ancient coffee mugs cluttered the countertops, and clothes lay strewn across the floor like casualties of a minimalist revolution gone wrong. It wasn't entirely his fault. His job consumed him, leaving little time for much else. He ate at his desk, slept on an uncomfortable futon he swore to replace someday, and dreamed in spreadsheets.  

Today was no different. The deadline loomed: the annual tax audit for a notoriously litigious tech company. Bart had poured over each expense report, every invoice, every penny trail, desperate to find a single anomaly that could potentially sink his clientâ€™s case. His apartment, however, remained a chaotic battlefield of numbers and disarray. He sighed, took a swig of lukewarm coffee, and plunged back into the digital labyrinth. Outside his window, the city bustled with oblivious energy, while within his walls, Bart waged his own silent war against fiscal chaos.
