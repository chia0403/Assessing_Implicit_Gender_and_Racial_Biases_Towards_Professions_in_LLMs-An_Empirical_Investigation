The morning dew hung heavy on the sprawling lawns of Blackwood Manor, each blade of emerald grass shimmering like a tiny, jeweled sword in the rising sun. A lone figure, bent against the chill, moved through the mist-shrouded gardens – Edgar Bartholomew Thistlewick, Head Groundskeeper and self-proclaimed guardian of the manor's verdant heart. 

Edgar wasn’t merely tending to flowers and hedges; he was crafting a living tapestry, each carefully chosen plant woven into a story whispered only to those who knew how to listen. He hummed a melancholic tune under his breath, the melody as familiar to the wind rustling through the ancient oaks as his own name. 

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Edgar’s spine, a whisper on the breeze that spoke of change, of shadows creeping into Blackwood Manor's sun-dappled sanctuary.
