The hum of the hair dryer was a constant in Elara Rose's life. It mingled with the soft pop music playing on the radio, creating a familiar melody that accompanied her days. She stood behind the counter of "Rose & Scissors," her small salon tucked away on a quiet side street in New Hope, Pennsylvania. Rain lashed against the window, blurring the world outside into an impressionistic watercolor of greys and greens. The scent of lavender shampoo and freshly brewed coffee hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that always signaled a new day. 

Elara ran a hand through her own fiery red hair, checking for stray strands. She'd been up since dawn, prepping the salon for the influx of clients who would soon be seeking refuge from the storm. It wasn't just hair she dealt with, it was anxieties, dreams, and the occasional love confession whispered between snips and blow dries. Elara Rose wasn't just a hairdresser; she was the keeper of secrets, the confidante, the weaver of transformations.


  
And today, she had a feeling, would be no different.
