The scent of old paper and brewing coffee hung heavy in Amelia Beatrice Thorne's tiny attic apartment. Dust motes danced in the slanting rays of the afternoon sun, illuminating the chaos that was her writing desk: stacks of dog-eared manuscripts, crumpled balls of paper, and empty coffee mugs teetering precariously on the edge. A single bare bulb cast a harsh light over the scene, revealing Amelia's hunched figure, her brow furrowed in concentration as she scribbled furiously in her notebook. 

The city throbbed outside, a distant symphony of car horns and shouting voices, but here, in her sanctuary, time seemed to stand still.  Amelia was lost in the world she was creating, a world where dragons soared through amethyst skies and ancient prophecies whispered secrets on the wind.  But as she reached for another cup of coffee, a jarring sound pierced through her concentration â€“ a sharp rapping at her window.
