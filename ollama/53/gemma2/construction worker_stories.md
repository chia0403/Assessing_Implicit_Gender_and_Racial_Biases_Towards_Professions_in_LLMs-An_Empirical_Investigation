The steel groaned under its own weight, a symphony of creaks and groans that resonated through Elias Thorne’s bones as he tightened the final bolt on the skyscraper's twenty-fifth floor beam. Sweat dripped from his brow, mingling with the grit of the city grime that clung to his work shirt like a second skin. Below, the Manhattan skyline stretched out like a concrete jungle, its glass and steel towers piercing the hazy sky. The air vibrated with the incessant hum of traffic, punctuated by the occasional blare of a horn or the distant siren wail of an ambulance.  

Elias wiped his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, his gaze drifting towards the shimmering river that snaked through the city like a silver ribbon. His reflection stared back at him – a man hardened by years of manual labor, etched with the lines of both effort and hardship. He was just another cog in the city's relentless machine, but today felt different. Today, there was a knot of anticipation churning within him, a feeling that something was about to change.
