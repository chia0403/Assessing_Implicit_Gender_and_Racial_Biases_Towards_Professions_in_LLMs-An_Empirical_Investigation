The air in "Nailed It" was thick with the scent of acetone and jasmine. Tiny, iridescent flakes danced in the sunbeams slanting through the dusty window, catching on the mirrored surfaces that lined the walls.  Eleanor Pettigrew meticulously filed a customer's nails, her movements as precise and practiced as a surgeonâ€™s. Her lavender-hued apron, embroidered with sparkling pink flowers, fluttered slightly with each motion. Eleanor loved this space: the hushed intimacy of it, the quiet conversations, the way her hands could transform chipped and brittle nails into works of art. 

Today, however, something felt different. A tremor of unease ran through Eleanor, as though a stray thought had burrowed under her skin. It wasn't the usual pre-lunch rush, nor the slight prickle of annoyance from the persistent chatterbox in the corner. No, this was deeper, a sense that the quiet hum of her everyday life was about to be disrupted.
