The air in The Golden Kettle hung thick with the scent of simmering garlic and thyme, laced with the sharp tang of lemon zest.  Elara Juniper wiped her brow, leaving a streak of flour across her forehead. Sweat beaded on her temple despite the cool draft from the open kitchen window, where the twilight cast long shadows over the cobblestone street. 

The Golden Kettle was tucked away in a forgotten corner of Oldhaven, its crooked facade barely visible behind overflowing flower boxes and the vibrant tapestry of market stalls lining the square. It was a haven for weary travelers and locals alike, drawn by Elara's reputation for crafting hearty, comforting meals from the simplest ingredients. Tonight, however, even her most seasoned hand trembled slightly as she prepped for the arrival of Lord Alaric Thorne, a notoriously demanding nobleman known for his discerning palate and even more discerning temper.
