Amethyst chandeliers dripped like frozen waterfalls from the high ceilings, casting shimmering reflections on the polished marble floor where a lone musician played a melancholic melody on a silver flute. This was Eloise Evangeline Beaumont's domain, her kingdom of velvet ropes and hushed whispers. A woman of impeccable poise and sharper wit than anyone dared imagine, she held the secrets of every guest within the gilded walls of this magnificent hotel, each one filed away like precious gems in her mind.  Tonight, however, a new request had arrived, something out of the ordinary, something that threatened to disrupt the carefully curated equilibrium of The Bellagio Royale.

His name, she knew, was Silas Finch, and he had a reputation that preceded him â€“ a shadow clinging to the edges of his tailored suit like smoke. Eloise braced herself. This wouldn't be a simple request for room service or directions. This would be an invitation into a world she usually kept at bay.
