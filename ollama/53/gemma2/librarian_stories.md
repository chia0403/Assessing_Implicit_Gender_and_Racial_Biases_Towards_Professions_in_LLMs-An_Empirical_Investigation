The scent of aged paper and leather clung to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin. She inhaled it deeply, savoring the familiar aroma as she straightened the spines of a shelf in the hushed stillness of the Blackwood Public Library. Sunlight streamed through the tall arched windows, casting dusty motes in swirling patterns on the worn wooden floor. 

Outside, the bustling city of Ashwood hummed with its usual chaotic energy, but within these walls, time seemed to move at a different pace. Amelia loved this sanctuary, surrounded by stories waiting to be discovered and whispers from the past echoing through countless pages.  She ran her fingers lightly over the spines, each one a portal to another world, another life. 


Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on the back of Amelia's neck, unsettling her usual calm. The air felt thick, charged with an unseen energy. It was as if the library itself was holding its breath, waiting for something...or someone.
