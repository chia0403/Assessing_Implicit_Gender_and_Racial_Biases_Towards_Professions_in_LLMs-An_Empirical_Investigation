The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara June Sterling, casting a sterile glow on the rows of eager smiles lined up in the waiting area. She took a deep breath, the familiar scent of peppermint mouthwash and antiseptic clinging to the air like a second skin. Elara loved this feeling, the controlled chaos before the rush began.  

Her dental practice, nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, felt less like a medical facility and more like a warm community hub.  Oakhaven wasn't exactly bustling â€“ it was the kind of small town where everyone knew their neighbour's dog's name, but Elara cherished its quiet charm. It was a world away from the chaos of her childhood in Chicago, a city she rarely thought about anymore.


Outside, the sun cast long shadows across the quaint main street lined with shops and cafes. The crisp autumn air carried the scent of fallen leaves and cinnamon, a comforting reminder that change was always brewing, even in Oakhaven's tranquil embrace.
