The pungent aroma of disinfectant mingled with the earthy scent of hay, a familiar perfume to Dr. Amelia Grace Sterling. She stood in her barn clinic, its walls lined with framed veterinary posters from decades past and mismatched crates stacked high with medical supplies. A dusty beam of sunlight slanted through a grimy window, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor. 

Amelia adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up her nose as she surveyed the scene.  A large, shaggy sheep named Bartholomew was bleating loudly in his pen, his woolly flanks twitching nervously. Amelia sighed, knowing this wouldn't be a quick visit. Bartholomew had a history of dramatic pronouncements about any ailment, real or imagined. 


She knelt beside the anxious sheep, her voice calm and soothing as she addressed him, "Alright, Bartholomew, what seems to be the trouble today?"

The setting sun cast a golden glow across the rolling hills beyond the barn, painting the landscape in hues of amber and crimson. Amelia's small rural clinic, nestled at the edge of a quiet village in the heart of Scotland, was her sanctuary. It was a place where animals came for healing, and she found solace in tending to their needs.
