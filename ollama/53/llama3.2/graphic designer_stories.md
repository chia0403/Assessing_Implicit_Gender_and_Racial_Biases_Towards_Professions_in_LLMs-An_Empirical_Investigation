Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled off the Pacific Ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Tidal Cove in a damp, grey mist. The streets were empty, save for the solitary figure of Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a graphic designer who worked from home in her cozy studio apartment overlooking the sea.

Lexi's fingers flew across the keyboard as she worked on a new project for the local surf shop, designing a fresh logo that would appeal to the town's young and adventurous crowd. She took pride in her work, pouring her passion for creativity into every design she created. As she clicked through the final touches of her latest concept, Lexi couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness – it was as if there was something more out there for her, just beyond the horizon.

The sound of seagulls carried on the wind as Lexi gazed out the window, watching the fog swirl around the rocky shoreline. It was days like this that made her wonder if she had made a mistake leaving New York City to start fresh in Tidal Cove. The town's tight-knit community and breathtaking natural beauty were undeniable, but sometimes Lexi felt like she was stuck in a rut, struggling to find her place in this small, quirky world.

Little did Lexi know, the mist-shrouded streets of Tidal Cove would soon be about to reveal a secret that would shake her life – and design – forever.
