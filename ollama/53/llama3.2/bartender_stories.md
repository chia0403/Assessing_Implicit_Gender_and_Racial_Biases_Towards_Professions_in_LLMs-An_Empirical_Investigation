Here's a potential story opening:

The neon sign above the bar creaked in the wind, casting a gaudy glow over the rain-soaked streets of New Orleans. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of cheap perfume and stale beer, but bartender Emmeline "Emmie" LaFleur knew it like the back of her hand. She had spent countless nights wiping down the bar, listening to the locals' stories, and serving up shots of absinthe to unsuspecting tourists.

It was a chilly autumn night in October 1922, and the jazz was hot in the city. The sounds of Louis Armstrong's horn wafted through the streets, mingling with the clinking of glasses and the hushed conversations of the crowd gathered at Jacques' Tavern. Emmie had worked here for three years, ever since she'd left her small town in rural Louisiana to chase a dream of making it big as a bartender.

As she polished a glass with a white cloth, her eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar faces and the occasional newcomer. She knew most of them by name – there was old Manfred, who came in every night for his usual whiskey on the rocks; Rachel, the flapper from uptown, who sipped champagne cocktails at the bar; and Claude, the young trumpet player, who'd stop by after his gigs to shoot the breeze with Emmie.

But tonight felt different. Tonight, a stranger walked into Jacques' Tavern, his eyes scanning the room as if searching for something – or someone. Emmie's instincts prickled, and she felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew that look, the one that said trouble was coming to town.
