Here's a potential story opening and setting for an author protagonist:

The mist-shrouded streets of Edinburgh whispered secrets to the wind as Emilia Elizabeth MacTavish stepped out of her small flat and onto the damp pavement. The pale moon cast an eerie glow over the city, casting long shadows behind the ancient stone buildings that seemed to loom over her like sentinels.

Emilia, a successful author of historical fiction novels, had always been drawn to the atmospheric and mysterious energy of Edinburgh. As she walked through the streets, the familiar scent of damp earth and moss filled her nostrils, transporting her to the world she wrote about – a world of castles, wars, and legendary figures that seemed to come alive on the page.

Tonight was different, though. Tonight, Emilia felt restless, as if the city itself was urging her to step out into the night air and follow some hidden path. She had been working on her new novel for months, pouring all her energy into it, but the words had begun to feel stale, trapped within the confines of her own mind.

As she walked, the mist swirled around her ankles, carrying with it whispers of forgotten stories and half-remembered legends. Emilia felt a shiver run down her spine – was she really alone in this vast, dark city? And what secrets lay hidden beneath its ancient stones, waiting to be uncovered?

The question seemed to echo through the misty streets like a challenge, drawing Emilia deeper into the night, with no clear destination in mind, only an insatiable hunger for answers.
