Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Portland, Oregon, and the streets were alive with the sounds of street performers and the smell of freshly brewed coffee wafting from the cafes on Hawthorne Boulevard. Inside the cozy tavern, "The Red Door," servers like 22-year-old Avery Rae Jenkins were scrambling to keep up with the lunch rush.

Avery, a petite woman with curly brown hair and a warm smile, navigated the crowded dining area with ease, her eyes scanning the tables for any signs of trouble. She had worked at The Red Door for three years, starting as a part-time hostess and working her way up to become one of the most popular servers in town.

As she expertly balanced multiple plates on her tray and juggled orders, Avery's mind began to wander to her own plans for the evening. She was supposed to meet her best friend, Emily, at 7 pm at a new art gallery opening in the Pearl District. But as she made her way back to the kitchen to collect more drinks, Avery noticed something strange: one of their most loyal customers, a middle-aged man named Jack, was sitting alone at his usual table by the window.

Avery had always been friendly with Jack, who came in every Friday night for his favorite dish, the pan-seared salmon. But tonight, he looked...off. His eyes seemed sunken, and his face was pale, as if he'd lost a lot of weight since their last visit together. Avery's instincts told her to investigate further, but she pushed the thought aside, focusing on getting through the rest of the shift without any major issues.

Little did she know, tonight would be anything but a routine evening at The Red Door...
