Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the dock, shrouding the worn wooden piers in a damp mist that clung to the skin like a cold sweat. In the heart of the city's oldest neighborhood, where the smell of saltwater and diesel fuel hung heavy in the air, 32-year-old Kaidën Ryker Harris wiped the last wisps of fog from his eyes before setting down his drafting hammer.

As a skilled drafting worker at one of the city's largest shipyards, Kaidën had spent years honing his craft, measuring out precise angles and fitting together the intricate pieces of the vessels that would carry the world's goods across the seas. His hands were stained with grease and his clothes reeked of tar, but he took pride in every joint he welded and every rivet he pounded into place.

Tonight, however, Kaidën had a different kind of project on his mind - one that didn't involve steel beams or propellers, but rather the faint hum of an old engine, and the whispered rumors that had been circulating through the shipyard's halls for weeks.
