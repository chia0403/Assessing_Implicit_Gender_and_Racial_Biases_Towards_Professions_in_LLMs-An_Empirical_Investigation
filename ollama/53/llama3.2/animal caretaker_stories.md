Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Opening Scene**

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy streets and homes. In a cozy little cottage on the outskirts of town, Ember Maeve Wilder stirred in her bed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. As an animal caretaker, she was no stranger to early mornings, but there was something special about this one.

Ember had spent the previous evening reviewing the week's schedule for the various animals in her care - from Whiskers, the mischievous raccoon at the local zoo, to Luna, the gentle giant of a bear living in the nearby woods. She had also made arrangements with her friend and colleague, Dr. Rachel Patel, to help with a special project: transporting a group of orphaned fawns to their new home on the other side of the state.

As Ember swung her legs over the side of the bed, she gazed out the window at the lush green forest beyond her backyard. The trees were still shrouded in mist, and the air was crisp with the scent of damp earth and new life. It was going to be a beautiful day.

**Setting**

The town of Willow Creek was nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, where the rolling hills and dense forests had been home to Ember's family for generations. The Wilder cottage, perched on a hill overlooking the town square, was a charming old place with weathered stone walls and a tin roof that seemed to be held together by sheer force of will.

Ember's work took her all over the region, from the busy streets of Knoxville to the rural backwoods of eastern Tennessee. She had an encyclopedic knowledge of the local wildlife, gained from years of studying under Dr. Patel and working with various conservation organizations. Whether it was helping injured birds find their way back to the wild or rehabilitating animals for release into sanctuaries, Ember's passion for animal care was infectious.

Despite her love of the work, however, Ember couldn't shake the feeling that something was off this morning. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but a sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach as she dressed and began to make breakfast.
