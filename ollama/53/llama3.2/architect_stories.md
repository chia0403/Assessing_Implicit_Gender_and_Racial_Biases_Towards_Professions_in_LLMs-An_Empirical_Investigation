Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain poured down on the city like a relentless curse, casting a grey mist over the steel and concrete canyons of New Haven. Inside her small, cluttered office, architect Ava Elena Vasquez hunched over her drafting table, her eyes fixed on the intricate model of the new skyscraper project that was due to be presented to the city council in just a few days.

Ava's fingers moved deftly over the tools on her desk, clicking and whirring as she tweaked the proportions of the tower's cantilevered roofline. Her long, dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose that deepened to brown in the afternoon light streaming through the grimy office window.

It was going to be a tough pitch - the city council was notorious for its tough love when it came to new development projects. But Ava had spent months pouring over the blueprints, convinced that she could convince them that this one was different. This one would be sustainable, innovative, and above all, beautiful. And as she worked, her mind wandered back to the strange letter she'd received a week ago - an anonymous message with only two words: "Don't build."

Ava's heart skipped a beat as she wondered who could have sent it, and what they meant by those cryptic words. She pushed the thought aside, focusing on the task at hand. But the seed of doubt had been planted, and she couldn't shake the feeling that her life was about to take a dramatic turn.
