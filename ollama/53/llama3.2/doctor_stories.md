Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Elliot Thompson stood at the edge of the hospital's rooftop garden, gazing out over the city skyline as the sun set behind the towering skyscrapers. The soft glow of the setting sun cast a warm orange light over the concrete jungle, but it did little to ease the sense of unease that had been growing inside him all day.

As an ER doctor at New Haven General Hospital, Elliot was no stranger to high-stress situations and life-or-death decisions. But tonight felt different. Tonight, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that a particular patient's case was going to be more than just another routine diagnosis and treatment.

Elliot took a deep breath, trying to clear his mind of the thoughts swirling in his head. He had spent years honing his skills as a doctor, and he knew that intuition could be a powerful tool - but it could also be misleading. He needed to focus on the task at hand, not let his own emotions cloud his judgment.

As he turned away from the view, his eyes landed on the small notebook tucked into his pocket. It was an old habit of Elliot's, jotting down notes and observations about patients in a private journal before bed. Tonight, it felt like a good idea - maybe the words on those pages would help him make sense of the nagging feeling that had taken up residence in his mind.

With a quiet sigh, Elliot pulled out the notebook and began to flip through its yellowed pages, searching for inspiration in the scribbled notes and hasty sketches. Little did he know, this ordinary evening was about to take an extraordinary turn...
