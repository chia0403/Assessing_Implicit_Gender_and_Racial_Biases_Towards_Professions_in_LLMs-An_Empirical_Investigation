Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the city of New Haven, casting a golden glow over the crumbling industrial complex where Jack "Hawk" Hawkins spent most of his days working as a construction foreman. A ruggedly handsome man in his late 30s with a thick beard and a perpetual air of exhaustion, Hawk had spent years building skyscrapers and fixing factories, but nothing could have prepared him for what was about to hit.

As he rode the elevator up to the rooftop site, the sound of hammering and drilling echoed through the metal walls, punctuated by Hawk's own deep voice as he barked orders at his team. The wind whipped across the steel beam that served as the project's anchor point, carrying with it the acrid scent of welding sparks and the distant tang of saltwater from the harbor below.

Hawk stepped out onto the concrete platform, his eyes squinting against the glare of the setting sun. He took a deep breath, feeling the familiar weight of his hard hat in his hand and the ache in his muscles that came with a long day's work. And then he saw it - a small piece of paper caught in the rusty mesh of the anchor point's cable. Hawk's heart skipped a beat as he plucked the note free, his mind racing with possibilities.

The message was brief, scrawled on the back of a crumpled coffee cup: "Meet me at Joe's Bar at midnight. Come alone."
