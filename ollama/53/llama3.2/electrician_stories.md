Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this. The neon lights of the local bars and shops reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted sidewalks. Inside the cramped offices of "Spark Electric," the smell of sweat and ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Jack Edwardson, the 32-year-old electrician with a mind for circuitry and a penchant for solving problems.

Jack wiped the sweat from his brow as he gazed out the grimy window, watching the rain drum against the pavement like a thousand tiny fingers. It was going to be one of those nights – the kind where the phone never stopped ringing and the clients never seemed satisfied with the work Jack did. He sighed, rubbing his tired eyes, knowing that he'd spend the next few hours hunched over wiring diagrams and circuit breakers, trying to keep up with the demands of a small but lucrative trade.

As he sat at his cluttered desk, surrounded by half-finished projects and dusty textbooks, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The calls had been coming in all day – every customer seemed to be complaining about their electrical system being on the fritz, and none of them seemed to have any idea what was wrong. It was as if... well, Jack wasn't sure what it was, but he knew he needed to find out.

And then, just as he was starting to get settled into his work for the night, the phone rang.
