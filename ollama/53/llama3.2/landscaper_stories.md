As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the sky, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy town of Oakdale, California, landscaper Elijah Ryder Jenkins made his way down the cracked sidewalk of his small office, a worn-out sign reading "EJ's Green thumb" creaking in the gentle breeze. The smell of fresh-cut grass and damp earth filled the air as he unlocked the door to his modest shop, a haven for all things green and growing.

The streets surrounding Elijah's office were lined with ancient trees, their gnarled branches stretching towards the sky like nature's own cathedral. The pavement was worn smooth by decades of foot traffic, and the sound of children's laughter carried on the wind as they played in the park across the street. It was a peaceful evening, one that Elijah had grown to love over the years, a time when the world seemed to slow down and the beauty of nature could be savored.

But despite the tranquility of the surroundings, Elijah couldn't shake off the feeling of restlessness that had been growing inside him all day. A mysterious package had arrived at his office earlier in the week, addressed to him with no return address and containing only a single sentence: "They're coming for you." The words had left Elijah's stomach churning, and he had found himself wandering the streets of Oakdale all day, lost in thought and trying to make sense of the ominous message. As he stepped inside his office, a sense of unease settled over him like a shroud, and he couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead for him and the quiet life he had built in this small town.
