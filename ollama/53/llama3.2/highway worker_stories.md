As the sun set over the vast expanse of Interstate 80, casting a golden glow over the deserted stretch of asphalt, Highway Worker Number 432, Ryder Everett Thompson Jr., trudged wearily towards his makeshift shelter. The worn steel sign above the nearby rest stop read "Mile Marker 235: Willow Creek", but to Ryder, it was just another reminder of the long, lonely hours he spent maintaining the nation's infrastructure.

Ryder, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-30s with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, had been working as a highway worker for over a decade. He took pride in his work, meticulously inspecting the road surface, clearing debris from the shoulders, and repairing potholes that seemed to sprout up overnight like weeds. Despite the physical demands of the job, Ryder felt a deep sense of satisfaction knowing he was contributing to the smooth flow of commerce and travel that kept America's economy humming.

As he made his way towards his shelter, a faded, four-wheel-drive truck rumbled to life behind him, sending a plume of dust swirling into the air. Ryder watched as the vehicle vanished into the fading light, leaving behind only the faint hum of its engine and the soft crunch of gravel beneath his feet. The silence was almost deafening, punctuated only by the occasional hoot of an owl or the distant rumble of thunder on the horizon.

Ryder took a deep breath, feeling the weight of his own solitude settle upon him like a mantle. It was moments like these that he longed for the connection and camaraderie of fellow workers, but those were few and far between out here in the middle of nowhere. As he settled into his shelter for the night, Ryder couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that a storm was brewing on the horizon â€“ one that would test his skills as a highway worker like never before.
