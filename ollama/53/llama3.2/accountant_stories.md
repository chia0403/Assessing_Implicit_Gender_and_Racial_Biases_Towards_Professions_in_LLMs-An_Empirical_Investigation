Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Haven were always at their most unforgiving on mornings like this. The sky was a deep, foreboding grey, and the wind whipped through the alleys with a malevolent glee that made even the hardened locals take notice. Amidst the drab, industrial landscape, one small office stood out: 345 Main Street, home to the accounting firm of Harold Winston Everett III.

Harold, or Hal as he was known to his friends and colleagues, trudged through the door, shaking the rain from his umbrella and peeling off his waterproof coat. He had spent countless hours poring over financial statements, crunching numbers, and chasing down errant invoices, but on days like this, it felt like the weight of the world was coming crashing down on him.

As he shed his wet shoes and boots, Hal couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. It wasn't just the rain that was getting to him; it was the nagging sense that something was off, that there was a hidden thread waiting to be pulled in the intricate web of numbers and ledgers that he spent his days untangling.

Little did Hal know, this was only the beginning of a year that would change everything.
