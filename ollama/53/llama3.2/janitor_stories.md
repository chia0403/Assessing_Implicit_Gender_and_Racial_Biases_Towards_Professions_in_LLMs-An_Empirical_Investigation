Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the worn linoleum floor, illuminating the dust motes that danced in the faint breeze from the air vents. Amidst this drab backdrop, a figure moved with quiet purpose, his eyes scanning the rows of lockers and classrooms with the practiced familiarity of one who knew every inch of this space. His name was Emrys Wellesley-Fitch, but to the students at Ravenswood High School, he was simply "Emrys," the janitor who kept their halls clean and their secrets safe.

It was a chilly autumn morning in 1995, and the air outside was crisp with the promise of change. But within these hallowed halls, Emrys moved with a sense of routine, his days blending together into an endless cycle of dusting, disinfecting, and erasing the footprints of the students who came and went like sand in the hourglass.

As he pushed his cart through the empty corridors, the echoes of past conversations and forgotten laughter seemed to reverberate off the walls, a reminder that even in this place of learning, everyone had stories to tell. And Emrys knew them all.
