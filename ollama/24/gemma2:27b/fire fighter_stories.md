Smoke choked Amelia "Amy" Callahan's lungs, stinging her eyes and blurring her vision. The roar of the inferno was deafening, a hungry beast devouring everything in its path.  She crouched low to the ground, battling the heat that radiated from the crumbling Victorian mansion before her. Its ornate wooden facade was now a blackened skeleton, windows shattered like empty sockets staring into the abyss.

The old house stood on Elm Street, nestled amongst a row of quaint shops and cafes. Tonight, however, it was a raging monster, spitting flames and raining embers onto the cobblestone street below. Amy knew time was running out. The residents were accounted for - thankfully all safe - but her crew had yet to locate Mrs. Hawthorne's beloved Persian cat, Mittens.

Amy tightened her grip on the nozzle of her hose, the cold metal a stark contrast to the inferno before her. Fear coiled in her stomach, a familiar companion in these high-stakes situations, but she pushed it down. She was Amelia Callahan, firefighter extraordinaire, and she wouldn't back down from this challenge, not while Mittens was still inside.
