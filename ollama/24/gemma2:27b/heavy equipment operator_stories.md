The rusted sunrise bled over the jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains, painting the sky in bruised hues of orange and purple. A chill wind whipped across the barren landscape, biting at Elias "Eli" Blackwood's exposed skin as he climbed into the cab of his Caterpillar D11 bulldozer. The engine coughed to life, a guttural roar that echoed through the valley, a sound Eli knew better than his own heartbeat.

He adjusted the worn leather cap on his head and squinted at the desolate expanse before him. His task today: clearing a swathe of scrubland for a new pipeline, a project as thankless as it was necessary. The wilderness here, once teeming with elk and grizzly bears, was slowly being devoured by the insatiable appetite of human progress. 

Eli, however, wasn't a man easily swayed by sentimentality. He saw his work as a necessity, a way to build the infrastructure that kept the world running. Still, there were days when the solitude gnawed at him, and the echoing silence amplified the loneliness in his soul. Today was shaping up to be one of those days.

As Eli engaged the gears and steered the behemoth machine forward, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. A shiver ran down his spine, a primal warning whispering through the wind. He paused, scanning the horizon, searching for the source of his unease.
