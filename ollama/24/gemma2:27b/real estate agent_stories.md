The midday sun beat down on Charleston's cobblestone streets, turning the humid air thick and syrupy.  Magnolia blossoms drooped from overflowing window boxes, their perfume battling with the scent of salt carried in on the breeze. Eloise Deveaux, her blonde hair escaping its neat chignon in tendrils damp with sweat, adjusted the strap of her leather briefcase and navigated the uneven sidewalk.

Eloise was known as Charleston's "Queen of Antebellum." With her Southern charm and encyclopedic knowledge of the city's historic homes, she could sell a crumbling carriage house to a millionaire faster than you could say "sweet tea." Today, however, her usual confidence felt brittle. Her latest listing, a grand Victorian on Rainbow Row, was proving more challenging than expected.
