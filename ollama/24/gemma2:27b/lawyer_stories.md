Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Cartwright's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The mahogany desk, usually a beacon of order in the chaotic world of law, was piled high with files. Each one represented a life teetering on the edge – a custody battle, a wrongful termination, an inheritance dispute – all demanding her attention. 

Amelia sighed, pushing back a strand of auburn hair that had escaped its bun. Her reflection in the rain-streaked windowpane showed the exhaustion etched onto her face.  Five years as a junior associate at Caldwell & Pierce had honed her legal acumen, but it hadn't prepared her for the emotional toll of fighting for people whose lives hung precariously in the balance.

Tonight, however, Amelia wasn't facing down an opposing counsel or poring over legal precedents. She was wrestling with a different kind of beast: doubt. A case had landed on her desk that morning – defending a young man accused of arson – and it felt different. It felt...wrong.  The evidence seemed damning, the client evasive, and a gnawing feeling told Amelia that this wasn't simply another day at the office. This was something more. Something that could change everything.
