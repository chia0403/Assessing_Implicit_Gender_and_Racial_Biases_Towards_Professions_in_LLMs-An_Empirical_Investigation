Rain lashed against the windows of Evelyn Rose Montgomery’s tiny office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  She stared out at the gray cityscape, its usual vibrant hum muffled by the downpour. 

Evelyn wasn't built for dreary days like this. Her own energy usually vibrated with a contagious warmth, but today it felt stifled, trapped beneath a layer of exhaustion and frustration. The cramped space, smelling faintly of antiseptic and liniment, seemed to close in on her.  

She had poured her heart and soul into building "Rise Again Physical Therapy," believing she could make a real difference in people's lives. Yet, here she was, three years in, facing eviction due to unpaid rent. The irony wasn't lost on her - helping others regain mobility while barely able to stand on her own two feet financially. 

Just then, the faint chime of the doorbell echoed through the office. Evelyn sighed. It wouldn’t be a new client. Not in this weather.  Perhaps it was Mrs. Patel from down the hall, needing help with her groceries again.
