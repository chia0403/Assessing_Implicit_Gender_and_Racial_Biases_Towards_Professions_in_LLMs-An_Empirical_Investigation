The rusty Cessna coughed and sputtered, its propeller wheezing like an asthmatic dragon.  Amelia “Ace” Davenport gritted her teeth, adjusting the throttle with practiced ease. Outside, the Alaskan wilderness sprawled beneath her – an endless tapestry of snow-capped peaks, sapphire lakes reflecting the cloudless sky, and boreal forests tinged with autumn gold. Ace scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of the remote mining camp nestled somewhere within this untamed expanse.

Her radio crackled to life, a gravelly voice tinged with desperation breaking through the static. "Ace, you reading me? We're running low on supplies down here." It was Old Man Jensen, the grizzled prospector who ran the camp. Ace had known him for years – a tough old bird who wouldn't hesitate to chew you out if your landing wasn't perfect. 


But Jensen was good people, and she owed him one after he helped her repair her engine last year. Besides, there was something about flying over this breathtaking landscape that always calmed her nerves, even when facing mechanical challenges or the unpredictable nature of Alaska’s weather.  Ace checked her fuel gauge – enough to reach the camp and make it back to Anchorage, but not much room for error. 

She tightened her grip on the yoke, steeling herself for the descent into Jensen's rough airstrip carved out of the mountainside. This was a flight Ace wouldn't soon forget.
