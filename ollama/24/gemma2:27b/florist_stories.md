The bell above the shop door tinkled merrily as Eloise Beaumont adjusted a drooping orchid stem. A symphony of scents, from delicate lilies to earthy roses, filled "Bloom & Bark," her quaint flower shop nestled on a cobblestone street in Prague's historic Old Town. Outside, the Vltava River glittered under a pale winter sun, reflecting the snow-dusted rooftops and Gothic spires. Inside, Eloise hummed along to Dvorak playing softly on the radio, her fingers deftly weaving emerald ferns and crimson carnations into a vibrant bouquet. 

But today, Eloise's usual tranquility was tinged with unease. A strange man had been loitering outside the shop for days, his gaze lingering too long on Eloise as she worked. He wore a heavy coat that concealed his features, but Eloise could sense something unsettling in his piercing blue eyes. She tried to dismiss it as paranoia, but a shiver ran down her spine every time he appeared.
