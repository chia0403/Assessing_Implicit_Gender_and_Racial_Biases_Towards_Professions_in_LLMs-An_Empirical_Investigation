The air hung thick and humid in New Orleans, even at 6 am. Sweat beaded on Theodore "Teddy" Beaumont's forehead as he wrestled with a tangle of ancient wiring beneath the floorboards of a crumbling Victorian mansion. The scent of dust, mildew, and something vaguely floral – perhaps jasmine – drifted up from the crawlspace. Teddy grunted, tugging at a stubborn wire that refused to budge. 

This house, on Esplanade Avenue, was a classic New Orleans beauty, with wrought iron balconies draped in bougainvillea and peeling pastel paint. Unfortunately, its electrical system hadn't seen an upgrade since Teddy's grandfather had been a young man. The wiring was like a tangled spiderweb, threatening to short out at any moment.

Teddy paused, wiping the sweat from his eyes. He loved the challenge of these old houses, the way each one held a story hidden within its walls. But sometimes, he wished they hadn't been built with such an aversion to modern conveniences.
