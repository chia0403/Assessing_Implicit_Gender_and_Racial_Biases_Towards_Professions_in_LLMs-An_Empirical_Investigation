Rain lashed against the windows of the Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already muted autumn landscape outside. The air inside smelled faintly of disinfectant and stale coffee, punctuated by the occasional squeak of a wheelchair rolling down the hallway. Eloise Ainsworth, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, sighed as she looked at the clock. It was nearly 4 pm, which meant another hour of paperwork before she could head home.  

Eloise loved being an occupational therapist, helping patients rediscover their independence after injury or illness. But the endless stream of documentation often felt like it sucked the joy out of her day. Today, however, promised to be different. A new patient was arriving â€“ a young musician who had lost his ability to play after a car accident. Eloise couldn't wait to meet him and help him find his way back to his passion.
