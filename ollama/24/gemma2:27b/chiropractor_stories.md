Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane, blurring the neon glow of "Dr. Alistair Finch: Chiropractor" into an impressionistic smear. Inside the waiting room, the only sound besides the insistent drumming of rain was the rhythmic tick of the antique grandfather clock in the corner. Dr. Alistair Finch, a man whose salt-and-pepper hair mirrored the storm raging outside, sighed as he leaned back in his ergonomically designed chair. 

He'd been a chiropractor for over two decades, drawn to the profession by its ability to bring relief through gentle manipulation rather than invasive procedures. But lately, Alistair felt a gnawing unease. The aches and pains of his patients seemed deeper, more pervasive. Their stories spoke of exhaustion, anxiety, a sense of being perpetually "off-kilter."

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Alistair straightened in his chair, curiosity piqued. The figure who emerged from the downpour was unlike any patient he'd seen before. She was tall and cloaked in shadows, her face obscured by the hood of a heavy woolen cloak. As she approached, Alistair noticed something strange - an ethereal glow seemed to emanate from beneath the fabric, casting flickering shadows on the walls.

"Dr. Finch?" Her voice was a melodious whisper, barely audible over the relentless rain. "I believe you can help me."
