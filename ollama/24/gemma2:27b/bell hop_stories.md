The Grand Astoria Hotel hummed with a low, constant thrum. It was the sound of arriving carriages, hushed conversations in gilded lobbies, and the ceaseless click of heels on marble floors – all woven together into the intricate tapestry of luxury that Elias Bartholomew III had come to know intimately. As a bellhop for the past five years, he'd seen it all: giggling debutantes with overflowing suitcases, weary businessmen clutching briefcases, and even the occasional duchess incognito, her jeweled tiara hidden beneath a simple shawl.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Elias felt an unusual prickle of anticipation as he waited by the grand entrance, his crisp uniform impeccably pressed, brass buttons gleaming under the gaslight. The latest arrivals were rumored to be extraordinary – the renowned explorer, Professor Archibald Sterling, and his entourage, fresh from a perilous expedition into the uncharted Amazon. 

The rumors swirled: whispers of lost cities, ancient artifacts, and creatures unknown to science. Elias, whose imagination had always thrived on adventure stories devoured in stolen moments between shifts, couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement. This wasn't just another wealthy guest checking in; this was a man who had walked where few dared to tread, a living legend stepping into the opulent heart of the Grand Astoria.
