Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Alistair Finch's office, mirroring the tempest brewing in his gut. The stale air hung thick with cigarette smoke and desperation, a potent cocktail Finch had become intimately familiar with over the years. His desk, a scarred oak behemoth littered with overflowing ashtrays, half-empty coffee mugs, and case files teetering precariously on its edge, seemed to mock him.

Finch, his trench coat still dripping from the downpour, ran a hand through his thinning, salt-and-pepper hair. He hadn't slept properly in days, haunted by the image of Mrs. Eleanor Beaumont's tear-streaked face as she pleaded for him to find her missing son. The case reeked of something foul, something beyond a simple runaway teenager. Finch could feel it in his bones, the same way he felt the approaching storm hours before the first raindrop fell.  

He knew this city, its dark underbelly and shimmering facade, better than most. Heâ€™d walked its rain-slicked alleys and seen its secrets whispered in smoky backrooms. But even for a man who'd stared into the abyss of human depravity, this case felt different.
