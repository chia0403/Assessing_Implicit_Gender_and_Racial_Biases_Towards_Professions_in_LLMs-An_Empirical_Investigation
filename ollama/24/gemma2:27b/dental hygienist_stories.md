Elizabeth "Liz" Ramirez tapped her manicured nails against the stainless steel tray, a symphony of anxiety echoing through the sterile space. Liz wasn't usually one to get flustered, especially not after ten years cleaning plaque and polishing teeth at Dr. Henderson's practice.  But today was different. Today, she was facing Mr. Alistair Blackwood, the reclusive millionaire with a reputation for eccentricities and a smile rumored to be as sharp as his business acumen. 


Liz inhaled deeply, trying to steady her nerves. The door creaked open, revealing a tall, imposing figure shrouded in shadow. "Mr. Blackwood?" Liz ventured, squinting slightly to make out his features.  

He stepped into the light, and Liz's breath caught in her throat. His smile, as rumored, was dazzlingly white against the backdrop of his tanned face, but his eyes were cold and calculating. This wasn't just any dental appointment; this felt like stepping into a high-stakes game, with rules Liz didn't yet understand.
