Amelia, her auburn hair escaping its braid in unruly wisps, hunched over a drafting table littered with charcoal sketches and ruler-straight lines. Outside, the London night pressed against the windowpanes, a symphony of carriage wheels and distant hawkers' cries blending with the steady tick of Amelia's grandfather clock.

He craved "something extraordinary, something that whispers of ancient Rome but breathes modern elegance," a contradictory desire that left Amelia feeling like she was trying to sculpt clouds.
