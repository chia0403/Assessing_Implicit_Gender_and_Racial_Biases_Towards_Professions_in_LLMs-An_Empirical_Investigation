The scent of chalk dust and overripe bananas hung heavy in the air of Mrs. Amelia Cartwright's third-grade classroom. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in its path and highlighting the faded, crayon-drawn mural of a jungle scene adorning one wall. Outside, the playground buzzed with the excited shrieks of children released from their afternoon lessons.

A knot of anxiety tightened in her chest, squeezing out any semblance of the usual bubbly enthusiasm she brought to teaching. The news, delivered earlier that day by a somber-faced principal, echoed in her mind: budget cuts were coming, and Mrs. Cartwright's position was at risk.
