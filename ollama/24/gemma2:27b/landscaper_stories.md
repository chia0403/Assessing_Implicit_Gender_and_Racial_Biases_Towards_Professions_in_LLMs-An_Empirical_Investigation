The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass.  Sunlight streamed through the ancient oak tree in Evelyn Blackwood's backyard, dappling the worn stone patio where she knelt, meticulously pruning a bed of lavender. Her weathered hands, calloused from years of coaxing life from the earth, moved with practiced ease. Sweat beaded on her brow, but she barely noticed. Evelyn found solace in the rhythmic snip of shears, the gentle rustle of leaves, the steady thrumming of bumblebees drunk on nectar.

Evelyn wasn't just a landscaper; she was an artist who sculpted beauty from chaos. Her clients relied on her not just to mow lawns and trim hedges, but to transform their outdoor spaces into havens of tranquility. Today's project was no exception: a sprawling Victorian estate with overgrown gardens yearning for her touch.

As Evelyn straightened up, stretching her aching back, she noticed a glint of something metallic beneath the lavender bush. Curiosity piqued, she reached down and carefully unearthed a tarnished silver locket, its surface etched with intricate floral designs. It felt oddly warm in her hand, pulsing with a faint energy that sent shivers down her spine.

This was no ordinary find. This locket held a secret, and Evelyn knew, deep in her bones, that it would lead her on an adventure far beyond the manicured lawns she knew so well.
