Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, blurring the normally bustling street scene into an impressionist painting of greys and yellows.  Elias sighed, running a hand through his already dishevelled silver hair. He glanced at the clock – 4:17 pm. Another day winding down with barely a patient in sight. 

The relentless drizzle had kept everyone indoors, leaving Elias alone with the low hum of the ventilation system and the faint smell of antiseptic lingering in the air.  He missed the days when his waiting room was overflowing, filled with the nervous chatter of patients and the reassuring click of dental tools. Now, the silence was deafening, a constant reminder of the dwindling clientele and the anxieties gnawing at him. Elias worried about the future of his practice, the legacy he'd built over decades slowly slipping away.  

Today, however, something was different. A single envelope lay on his reception desk, addressed in neat, cursive handwriting. Curiosity piqued, Elias crossed the room and picked it up, the crisp paper cool beneath his fingers. There was no return address, only his name, "Dr. Elias Thorne," printed with meticulous care.  He turned it over, a strange sense of anticipation rising within him. The wax seal bore an intricate emblem – a stylized tooth entwined with a serpent.
