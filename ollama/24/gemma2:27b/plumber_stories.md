Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's workshop, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the symphony of clanks and groans emanating from his ancient tools.  The air hung thick with the scent of rust, mildew, and lukewarm coffee, a familiar aroma to Bart who had spent more than half his life hunched over dripping pipes and stubborn faucets.

Outside, the world was a blurry watercolour wash of greys and greens. The gutters overflowed, spewing miniature waterfalls onto the cobblestone street below. A chill wind whistled through the gaps in the windowpanes, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and distant thunder. It wasn't ideal weather for plumbing emergencies, but Bart knew that in this weather-beaten port town of Saltwind, trouble always found a way to brew.

Just then, the insistent clang of his workshop bell jolted him upright. He wiped greasy hands on his overalls and trudged towards the heavy oak door, bracing himself for whatever watery wrath awaited him.
