Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile pallor on the steel table where the suspect sat, his gaze fixed intently on the peeling linoleum floor. He hadnâ€™t spoken a word in over an hour, his silence as impenetrable as the concrete walls surrounding them. 

Evelyn sighed, adjusting her spectacles and smoothing down the crisp lines of her navy suit jacket. The weight of expectation pressed upon her; Detective Miller was counting on her to break through this man's stoicism. He was their prime suspect in a string of brutal home invasions, but without a confession, they had nothing concrete to hold against him.

Evelyn glanced at the manila folder lying open before her, filled with crime scene photos and witness statements. The victims, all elderly and vulnerable, described a masked assailant who moved with ruthless efficiency, leaving behind a trail of stolen valuables and terror.  The unsettling detail that haunted Evelyn most was the lack of physical violence; the suspect only took what he wanted, leaving his victims shaken but physically unharmed. 

Why? What drove this man to invade their homes, to violate their sense of security without resorting to brute force? It was a puzzle that gnawed at Evelyn's mind, a challenge she couldn't resist.  She leaned forward, her voice calm and measured as she addressed the silent figure across from her:

"Mr. Hayes, I understand this is a difficult time for you. But we need your help to understand what happened."
