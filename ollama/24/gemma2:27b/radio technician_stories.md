The greasy scent of ozone clung to Elias Finch like a second skin. He inhaled deeply, relishing the familiar tang that permeated his cluttered workshop. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof, sending waves of heat rippling through the dusty air. Inside, however, was a haven of cool humming and flickering tubes.

Elias squinted at the schematics spread across his workbench, tracing the intricate pathways of circuits with a calloused finger. A vintage Zenith radio lay disassembled beside him, its innards exposed like the heart of some mechanical beast. He needed to isolate the faulty capacitor, but the problem was proving more stubborn than usual.  Frustration gnawed at him, a familiar itch under his skin.

Suddenly, a sharp crackle erupted from the battered speaker perched on a shelf above him. Elias froze, listening intently as the static resolved into a faint, distorted voice. It spoke in hushed tones, a language he couldn't quite decipher. His blood ran cold. He hadn't heard anything like it before, not even on his most powerful long-range antenna. This was somethingâ€¦ different.
