The air hung heavy with dust, flecked with sunlight that slanted through the open doorway of Silas Finch's workshop.  Outside, the midday sun beat down on the cobbled streets of Aethelhelm, turning them into shimmering ribbons. Inside, however, was cool and dim, the scent of damp stone mingling with the sweet, sharp tang of linseed oil. Silas, his face streaked with grime and sweat, paused in his work, the chisel poised above a block of pale grey limestone. He squinted at the rough outline he'd etched into the surface – the beginnings of an angel, wings outstretched, halo a mere suggestion at its crown.

Silas wasn't known for angels, though. His specialty was gargoyles. Grotesque, snarling creatures that leered down from rooftops, protecting their domain from ill fortune and evil spirits. But this commission, for the new cathedral being built on the hill overlooking Aethelhelm, demanded something different. Something hopeful. Something ethereal. 

He hefted the mallet, the familiar weight settling comfortably in his calloused hand. This angel wouldn't be easy. It required a delicacy of touch Silas rarely exercised. But the commission was too important to refuse – and besides, perhaps it was time for him to carve something beautiful, instead of just warding off the shadows.
