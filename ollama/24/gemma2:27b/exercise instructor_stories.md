The humid Miami air clung to Esmeralda "Esme" Flores like a second skin as she surveyed her outdoor bootcamp class. Palm trees swayed lazily in the background, their fronds casting dappled shadows on the glistening asphalt. A chorus of cicadas chirped incessantly, a soundtrack to the grunts and huffs of her students battling through burpees. 

Esme adjusted the bandana holding back her fiery curls, her own breath coming in ragged gasps despite the fact she was merely demonstrating each exercise. Her eyes, the color of dark chocolate, scanned the diverse group before her â€“ a retiree with surprisingly toned biceps, a young couple working out together, a frazzled-looking mom trying to reclaim some semblance of pre-baby fitness. Esme thrived on this energy, on pushing people beyond their perceived limits and witnessing the quiet triumph in their eyes when they conquered a particularly tough set.

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she noticed a black SUV parked a block away, its tinted windows reflecting nothing back.  Esme knew it was irrational, but the car's presence unsettled her. It seemed to loom over the class like a watchful predator, disrupting the usual rhythm of her morning routine.
