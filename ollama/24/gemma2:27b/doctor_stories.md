Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Eleanor Vance's clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. The humid air hung thick and heavy, smelling faintly of antiseptic and woodsmoke from the stove she kept burning for warmth. Outside, the dusty street leading to her clinic was transformed into a muddy river, reflecting the flickering gaslights in distorted orange streaks.  

Eleanor sighed, pushing aside the stack of patient files that cluttered her desk. A cough rattled through the waiting room, followed by the muffled sobs of a child. It was always like this during the monsoon season; illness thrived in the damp, and Eleanor found herself working late into the night more often than not. 

She rose, smoothing down her already rumpled white coat, and headed towards the waiting room. A young woman with worried eyes clutched a feverish child to her chest. Eleanor smiled gently, offering them a seat by the fire.  "Let's see what we can do for your little one," she said, her voice calm and reassuring despite the exhaustion gnawing at her bones. 

The clinic in Malacca was Eleanor's sanctuary, a place where she could make a difference in the lives of those who needed it most. But tonight, even as she prepared to examine the child, a sliver of doubt crept into her mind.  Was this all there was? Would she forever be confined to this small, rain-soaked town, patching up wounds and chasing away fevers?
