The flickering neon sign outside "The Rusty Spoon" buzzed incessantly, casting an unsettling purple glow on Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's tired face as she unlocked the front door. The scent of stale beer and yesterday's fries hit her like a wall, familiar and vaguely nauseating. It was 6:00 AM, and Esme was already dreading the day ahead.

The Rusty Spoon wasn't exactly known for its culinary excellence, or its clientele for that matter. Nestled in a forgotten corner of downtown New Orleans, it catered to a motley crew of late-night revelers, struggling artists, and regulars whose names Esme had long since forgotten.  Today, however, promised to be different. A cryptic message from an unknown number had arrived on her phone the night before: "The raven knows. Be at The Spoon by dawn."

Intrigued and slightly unnerved, Esme decided to play along. What could it hurt? She needed the extra cash anyway, and a little mystery might spice up her otherwise mundane existence.  As she flipped the lights on, illuminating the worn booths and dusty jukebox, Esme couldn't shake the feeling that something big was about to happen. The raven knew. But what did it know, and why was Esme supposed to be involved?
