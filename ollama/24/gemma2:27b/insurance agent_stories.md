Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Thaddeus Blackwood's office, mimicking the torrent of paperwork cascading across his desk. The scent of stale coffee and damp paper hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of a dusty grandfather clock in the corner. Thaddeus, a man whose thinning hair and perpetually furrowed brow suggested a life steeped in anxieties both real and imagined, chewed on the end of his pencil as he scrutinized a claim form. Outside, the neon sign of "Blackwood & Sons Insurance" flickered erratically, casting an ominous glow across the deserted street.  

Thaddeus' world revolved around mitigating risk. He saw the worst in everyone, anticipating disaster lurking behind every smile and handshake. His motto, scrawled in bold letters above his desk: "Hope for the best, prepare for the worst," was a mantra born from years of witnessing misfortune unfold. 


But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up Thaddeus' spine as he glanced at the clock. It was nearly midnight. He should have been home hours ago, enjoying a rare quiet evening with his wife, Eleanor. Yet, here he was, wrestling with a particularly dubious claim involving a missing shipment of antique porcelain dolls.
