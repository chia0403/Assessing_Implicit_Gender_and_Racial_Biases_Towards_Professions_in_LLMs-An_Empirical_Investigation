The stale scent of chlorine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, cloying sweetness of industrial cleaner. Edgar Bartholomew hummed along to the crackling radio on his cart, a battered relic from the 1970s that only ever seemed to pick up AM stations. He expertly maneuvered the mop around the slick tiles of the Grand Astoria Hotel's ballroom, the echoing silence punctuated by the rhythmic swooshing of water and cleaner. 

The ballroom was a cavernous space, its vaulted ceiling adorned with ornate chandeliers now shrouded in dust cloths for the off-season. A giant stage sat empty at one end, waiting for the return of glittering gowns, booming orchestras, and waltzing couples. Edgar imagined them all swirling beneath the twinkling lights, their laughter echoing through the vast hall. He smiled wistfully, picturing himself amongst them â€“ a phantom dancer in his faded janitor's uniform.
