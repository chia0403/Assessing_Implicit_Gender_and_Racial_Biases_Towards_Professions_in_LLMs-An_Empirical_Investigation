Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Alistair Finchley's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. Papers littered his desk, each one a testament to the seemingly insurmountable case he was drowning in. Alistair, a man whose meticulously parted hair and starched shirt collar spoke volumes about his dedication to order, felt anything but ordered. He was a paralegal at Bailey & Sons, a firm notorious for taking on cases that smelled of desperation and defeat.

This particular case – defending Mrs. Eleanor Davenport, accused of embezzling funds from her late husband's charity – had Alistair feeling particularly frayed. The evidence against her seemed overwhelming: forged signatures, discrepancies in accounting records, even eyewitness testimony. Yet, something about the woman's quiet defiance during their meetings made Alistair believe there was more to the story. He just needed to find it.

The city outside, shrouded in a misty veil of rain and neon, hummed with a chaotic energy that Alistair usually found comforting. Tonight, however, the incessant honking and distant sirens only amplified his growing unease. He needed answers, and he needed them fast.
