Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the relentless drumming in Eleanor Ainsworth's head. The manuscript lay open on her antique writing desk, its pages mockingly blank. For weeks, Eleanor had been wrestling with writer's block, her once-fertile imagination now barren and lifeless.

The attic room of her Victorian townhouse in Edinburgh was usually a sanctuary, filled with the comforting scent of aged paperbacks and the soft glow emanating from a Tiffany lamp perched on a mahogany side table. But today, even the familiar surroundings couldn't pierce the fog of frustration that clung to Eleanor like a shroud. 

She needed inspiration, a spark to ignite her creativity and breathe life back into her story. The deadline for her latest novel loomed, a menacing shadow threatening to engulf her.  Eleanor sighed, pushing away from the desk and pacing the room, her footsteps echoing in the silence broken only by the rhythmic patter of rain. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh glistened under the dim glow of gaslights, their charm lost on Eleanor's troubled mind.
