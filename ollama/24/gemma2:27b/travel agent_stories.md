The flickering neon sign outside "Wanderlust Travels" buzzed like a trapped wasp. Amelia Beatrice Cartwright sighed, pushing away the lukewarm tea she'd been nursing for the past hour.  Rain lashed against the storefront window, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Business had been abysmal lately – online booking sites and discount airlines were slowly squeezing out the charm of a local travel agent. 

Amelia gazed at the dusty globe perched on her desk, its continents faded and scratched from years of eager fingertips tracing dream destinations.  She yearned for those days again, when clients walked in with wide eyes and hopeful smiles, longing to escape the mundane. Now, the only visitors were occasional retirees looking for bargain cruises or harried parents seeking all-inclusive resorts.

But today was different. A letter had arrived that morning, a crisp white envelope sealed with crimson wax. No return address, just an enigmatic symbol – a stylized compass rose. Curiosity warred with apprehension as Amelia delicately broke the seal. Inside lay a single card, its surface embossed with swirling gold lettering: "Your next adventure awaits. Meet me at The Rusty Compass, midnight."
