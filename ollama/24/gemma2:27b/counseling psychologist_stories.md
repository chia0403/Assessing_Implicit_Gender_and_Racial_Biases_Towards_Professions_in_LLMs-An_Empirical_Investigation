Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the storm brewing inside Dr. Evelyn Sinclair.  Her office, usually a sanctuary of warm light and calming earth tones, felt suffocating tonight. The scent of lavender from her diffuser couldn't quite mask the metallic tang of anxiety that hung heavy in the air. 

Evelyn stared at the file on her desk, the name "Jasper Thorne" stark against the beige paper. Jasper was her last client for the day, a young man wrestling with crippling social anxiety. He'd cancelled his previous three appointments, citing panic attacks. Tonight felt different; tonight, Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that something else was at play. 


The rain intensified, the wind howling like a tormented beast. Evelyn took a deep breath, reminding herself of her years of training, her dedication to helping people navigate their darkest corners. But Jasper’s case… it felt charged with an unseen energy, a current threatening to pull her under.
