The first blush of dawn painted the sky in shades of apricot and rose as Elias Blackwood surveyed his domain. Dew clung to the emerald grass like millions of tiny diamonds, reflecting the nascent light with a delicate sparkle.  He inhaled deeply, the air crisp and clean, carrying the scent of damp earth and blooming honeysuckle. The sprawling Victorian estate, with its manicured lawns, ancient oak trees, and vibrant flower beds, was Elias's sanctuary. For thirty years he had tended to it with unwavering dedication, nurturing every blade of grass and petal as if they were his own children. 

Today, however, a disquiet settled upon him. A strange tension thrummed beneath the idyllic facade, a subtle shift in the usual harmony.  As Elias reached for his trusty pruning shears, he noticed something glinting near the base of the ancient willow tree â€“ a single, scarlet feather, impossibly bright against the muted greens and browns. He frowned, an uneasy prickle crawling up his spine. Such a vibrant feather wasn't native to any bird he knew.  What could it mean?
