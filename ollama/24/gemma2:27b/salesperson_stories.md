Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Jerry's Used Autos," blurring the already faded paint on the dented Chevys and sputtering Fords crammed onto the lot. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Bartholomew Quill, or Bart as he preferred, adjusted his tie for the hundredth time that morning, a nervous tic honed over years of peddling jalopies to folks who couldn't tell a carburetor from a cucumber. 

Bart wasn't cut out for this life. He dreamed of something more refined – perhaps curating rare books in a dusty bookstore, or composing sonnets in a sun-drenched Parisian cafe. But life had a way of throwing curveballs, and Bart, with his mountain of student debt and a mother who needed constant care, was stuck slinging rust buckets for Jerry, a man whose moral compass pointed decidedly south.

Today, however, felt different. A strange energy crackled in the air, a sense of impending change that Bart couldn't quite explain. As he stared out at the rain-soaked lot, a glint of silver caught his eye – a sleek, futuristic car unlike anything he'd ever seen before. It sat tucked away in a shadowy corner, radiating an otherworldly aura that sent shivers down Bart's spine.
