Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor "Ellie" Vance. The flickering neon sign of the 'Lucky Cat' bar cast an anemic green glow across her cramped apartment, illuminating stacks of dog-eared notebooks and half-empty coffee mugs. Ellie, a journalist with a nose for trouble and a penchant for deadlines, stared at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen. 

Her latest assignment: expose the truth behind the sudden closure of the city's oldest orphanage, 'Hope House'. A place shrouded in whispers and rumors, Hope House had been Ellie's playground as a child â€“ a place she remembered with bittersweet nostalgia. Now, it was shuttered, its fate a mystery wrapped in bureaucratic red tape. The city officials were tight-lipped, the remaining staff reticent. But Ellie knew there was more to the story than met the eye. She could feel it in her gut, a gnawing sensation that something sinister lurked beneath the surface.
