Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Blackwood Manor, each gust rattling the ancient glass panes like bony fingers tapping impatiently. Eloise Ophelia Weatherby, her gray bun perched precariously atop her head, paused in her scrubbing of the cavernous kitchen floor. The manor, once a jewel of Victorian architecture, was now shrouded in a perpetual gloom, its grandeur fading under layers of dust and neglect. Eloise had been the sole caretaker for over a decade, her presence the only flicker of life in the silent house. 

Today, however, something felt different. A chill sharper than the autumn air snaked down Eloise's spine as she heard an unfamiliar creak from the upper floors â€“ a floor rumored to be sealed since the tragic disappearance of the Blackwood heir half a century ago.  Eloise hesitated, her gnarled hand tightening around the mop handle. Curiosity battled with decades-old caution, whispering tales of restless spirits and shadowed corridors.
