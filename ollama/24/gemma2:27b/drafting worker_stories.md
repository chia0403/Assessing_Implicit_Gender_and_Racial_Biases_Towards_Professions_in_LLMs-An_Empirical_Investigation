The air in the cramped drafting room hung heavy with the scent of graphite and stale coffee. Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on the steel roof of the factory, turning the space into a sauna. Elias Finchley squinted at his blueprints, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across the intricate lines and notations. His hand, calloused from years of wielding pencils and rulers, moved with practiced precision as he sketched a revised iteration of a hydraulic pump housing.
