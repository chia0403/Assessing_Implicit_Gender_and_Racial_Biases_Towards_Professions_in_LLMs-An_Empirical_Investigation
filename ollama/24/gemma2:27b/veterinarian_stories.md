Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s clinic, blurring the normally idyllic view of rolling green hills outside Ashwood. The wind howled like a mournful banshee, shaking loose tiles from the aging roof and sending shivers down Eleanor's spine. Inside, the air hung heavy with the mingled scent of disinfectant, wet dog fur, and fear.

Eleanor knelt beside a shivering Collie pup, its eyes wide with panic. A nasty gash ran along its leg, oozing blood onto the worn linoleum floor. The owner, a weathered farmer named Mr. Thompson, paced anxiously nearby, his calloused hands twisting a faded cap. "Poor Sparky," he muttered, his voice thick with worry. "He's never been hurt before."

Eleanor gently examined the wound, her brow furrowed in concentration. Tonight was shaping up to be one of those nights when the relentless storm mirrored the chaos unfolding within the clinic walls.
