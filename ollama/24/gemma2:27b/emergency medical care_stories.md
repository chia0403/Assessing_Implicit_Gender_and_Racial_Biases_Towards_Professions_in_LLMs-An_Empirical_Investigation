The air hung thick with the stench of stale sweat and antiseptic. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unforgiving glare over the cluttered waiting room. Amelia "Amy" Nguyen, her dark ponytail whipping against her scrubs as she rushed past, barely registered the anxious faces staring at her. She had been on shift for twelve hours already, the adrenaline keeping her going despite the gnawing fatigue in her muscles and the throbbing ache behind her eyes.

A gurney screeched down the hallway, its occupant obscured by a white sheet. Amy's heart clenched – another victim of the relentless city that never slept. She knew this feeling well: the anticipation mixed with dread, the constant tug-of-war between hope and despair. Today, she was working in the ER at Mercy General Hospital, a concrete behemoth smack-dab in the middle of Brooklyn, where life unfolded in all its messy glory – from joyous births to brutal accidents, from quiet desperation to explosive violence.
