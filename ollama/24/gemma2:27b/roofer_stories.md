The July sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Carter's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat trickled down his forehead, stinging his eyes as he carefully maneuvered himself across the steep pitch of the Victorian mansion's roof.

Eli, however, felt like an outsider. He'd only been in Oakhaven for six months, drawn by the promise of steady work and a fresh start after his life in Chicago had crumbled. But the town's polished facade hid a darkness Eli was slowly beginning to uncover.
