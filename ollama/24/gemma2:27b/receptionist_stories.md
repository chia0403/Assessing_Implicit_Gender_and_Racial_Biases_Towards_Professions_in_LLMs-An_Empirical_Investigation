The fluorescent lights hummed above Penelope Thistlewick's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn carpet and faux-leather chairs that populated the lobby. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic watercolour of greys and blues. It was another Tuesday afternoon at Spire Pharmaceuticals, and the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and quiet desperation. Penelope tapped a manicured fingernail against her desk, the click echoing in the cavernous silence. Her scarlet lipstick, carefully applied that morning, felt like a beacon of defiance in this dreary corporate wasteland.

Penelope yearned for something more than answering phones and directing visitors through the labyrinthine corridors of Spire Pharmaceuticals. But for now, she was stuck here, a cog in the vast machine of Big Pharma, dreaming of a day when her own name might grace a company sign, not just a nameplate on a chipped mahogany desk.
