Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear. Inside, Amelia Rose Thornton smoothed down her jade green tunic, the fabric cool against her skin.  A symphony of dripping water and rumbling thunder echoed around the empty waiting area, punctuated by the soft tinkling of wind chimes hanging above the reception desk. The storm had rolled in unexpectedly, chasing away most clients. Amelia sighed, her shoulders slumping slightly. Business had been slow lately, and this downpour wasn't helping.

She glanced at the clock - 6:15 pm. Only fifteen minutes until closing time. Just as she was about to start tidying up, the bell above the door chimed, announcing a late arrival. A figure emerged from the storm, their silhouette obscured by the swirling rain and fogged glass. Amelia straightened, curiosity piqued. Who would brave this weather for a massage?
