Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Evelyn Priceâ€™s office, a relentless tattoo mimicking the ache in her chest. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, adding to the general sense of bleakness that permeated the cramped space. Paperwork overflowed from trays onto the already cluttered desk. A half-eaten granola bar sat precariously on a stack of files labelled "High Risk." Evelyn sighed, rubbing tired eyes with the back of her hand.

She wasn't cut out for this job anymore. The endless cycle of paperwork, court dates, and broken promises was wearing her down.  Each face that crossed her desk seemed to carry the weight of desperation, a burden Evelyn felt acutely in her own soul. Today, she had to meet with Marco Diaz, a young man convicted of petty theft who hadn't reported for his mandated community service for weeks.

Evelyn braced herself for another disappointment, another story of hardship and lost hope. But as she reached for the file labelled "Diaz, Marco," something caught her eye: a faded photograph tucked into the corner, depicting a boy with a shy smile holding up a fish he'd clearly caught himself. It sparked a flicker of curiosity within Evelyn, a tiny ember of hope in the face of overwhelming gloom.
