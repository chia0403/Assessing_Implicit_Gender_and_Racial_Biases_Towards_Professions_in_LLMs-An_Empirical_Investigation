The rusted hinges screamed in protest as Eleanor Vance wrestled open the heavy wooden door. A gust of salty wind swept past her, carrying with it the tang of seaweed and the cries of gulls circling overhead. Stepping inside the abandoned lighthouse, Eleanor squinted through the dust motes dancing in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that pierced the grimy windows.

This forgotten sentinel stood on a craggy outcrop overlooking a churning sea, its white paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  Years of neglect had left it crumbling and overgrown with tenacious ivy, but Eleanor saw beauty in its decay. This was the perfect location for her latest project - a photo series exploring the ephemeral nature of time and the haunting elegance of forgotten places. 

Her battered camera bag thumped against her hip as she navigated the creaking wooden staircase leading to the lantern room. The air grew thicker with dust, tinged with the musty scent of old oil and salt-laced wood. Eleanor couldn't wait to capture the interplay of light and shadow in this dilapidated monument, to freeze a moment in time that seemed suspended between past and present.
