Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Professor Elias Blackwood's study, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the centuries-old glass. The fire in the hearth sputtered, casting flickering shadows that danced across the cluttered shelves overflowing with ancient tomes and arcane artifacts. Elias himself, his face etched with years of scholarly pursuit and shadowed by a tangle of iron-grey hair, stared intently at a weathered map spread out on his massive oak desk. The map depicted not familiar coastlines or mountain ranges, but a labyrinthine network of subterranean tunnels, their paths snaking beneath the very foundations of Oxford University. A faint shiver ran down Elias' spine as he traced the faded lines with his finger, feeling an unsettling premonition tug at his gut. This wasn't just academic curiosity anymore; it was something far more primal, a call whispered from the depths of forgotten history. 

Tonight, Elias Blackwood intended to answer that call.
