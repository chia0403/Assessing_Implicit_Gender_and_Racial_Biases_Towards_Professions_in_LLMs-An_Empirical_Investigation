Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Blackwood's fingers on the keyboard. The scent of mildew hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the crumbling Victorian house she'd inherited from her eccentric aunt. Dust motes danced in the sliver of moonlight piercing through the grime-coated glass, illuminating stacks of moth-eaten books and forgotten canvases leaning precariously against the walls. Amelia squinted at the screen, the words blurring as exhaustion gnawed at her.

Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in a crumbling seaside mansion not unlike her own dwelling, was proving to be more challenging than she'd anticipated. The characters refused to cooperate, their motivations muddled and their dialogue stilted. Amelia sighed, pushing away from the keyboard. Perhaps a change of scenery would help. 


She rose, her joints protesting with pops and creaks. Glancing out the window at the tempestuous night, she decided against venturing downstairs. Instead, she padded over to a dusty trunk tucked beneath the eaves, its brass clasps glinting faintly in the moonlight.  

Amelia knelt, remembering her aunt's whispered tales of hidden treasures and forgotten histories within these walls. As she lifted the heavy lid, a musty scent wafted up, mingled with something elseâ€¦something sweet and floral. Curiosity piqued, Amelia peered inside, her heart skipping a beat at what lay nestled amongst yellowed lace and faded photographs.
