The air in "Nails by Nadine" buzzed with the frenetic energy only a Friday afternoon could generate. Polished chrome gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting the chaos unfolding around Eloise Fontaine.  Eloise, her own nails adorned with intricate, shimmering snowflakes despite the balmy October weather, darted between clients like a hummingbird in overdrive.

A woman with an impossibly high ponytail and a chihuahua nestled in her purse demanded an emerald green gel manicure, while a businessman anxiously tapped his foot, waiting for Eloise to fix a chip on his "executive" black polish. The phone rang incessantly, punctuated by the whirring of the nail dryer and Eloise's sing-song voice as she navigated appointments and requests with practiced ease. 

Eloise thrived in this whirlwind.  The clattering tools, the scent of acetone mingling with strawberry hand cream, the constant stream of human interaction â€“ it all fed a deep-seated need for connection and purpose within her. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced beneath her practiced smile as she glanced out the window at the darkening sky.
