The insistent chirping of his phone alarm pierced through Amelia Cartwright's dream of swirling CMYK colors and impossibly sharp fonts. Groaning, she smacked the snooze button, burying her face back in the pillow. Dawn painted the sky outside her window with streaks of pale lavender and bruised orange, casting long shadows across her cluttered studio apartment. 

Empty coffee cups sat precariously on every surface â€“ a testament to the all-nighter Amelia had pulled trying to finalize a logo for a new artisanal kombucha brand. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and faint traces of lavender incense, a feeble attempt to mask the underlying smell of desperation that permeated her life these days.

Today was the deadline for the kombucha logo, and Amelia knew she wasn't happy with it.  The client, a relentlessly enthusiastic woman named Willow who spoke in pronouncements about "gut health" and "vibrational energy," had been incredibly vague about what she wanted.  Amelia felt trapped in a vortex of swirling green hues and abstract fermenting bubbles, none of which felt quite right.
