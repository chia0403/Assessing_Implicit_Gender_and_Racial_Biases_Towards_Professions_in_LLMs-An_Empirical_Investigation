The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the sweet, cloying scent of rosemary.  Outside, rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Finnegan's Fine Meats," each drop exploding like a tiny bomb in the already-oppressive stillness.

Seamus knew each cut intimately, could trace the lineage of a pig from its mother's sow to the final chop of its shoulder. But today, even the familiar sights and smells couldn't pierce the gnawing anxiety in his gut. A stranger was coming.
