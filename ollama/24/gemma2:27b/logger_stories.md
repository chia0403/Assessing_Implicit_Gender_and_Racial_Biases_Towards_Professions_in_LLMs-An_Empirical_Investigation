Rain hammered the corrugated tin roof of Elias Blackwoodâ€™s cabin like a thousand tiny fists. The rhythmic clatter was a familiar lullaby in these parts, but today it grated on Elias' nerves. He hunched over his chipped mug of lukewarm coffee, staring out at the swollen creek that roared past his porch. Three days the rain had fallen, turning the logging trails into treacherous mudslides and keeping him shackled to this rickety cabin.

Elias was a man built for hard work, his calloused hands and thick forearms testament to years spent wrestling giants of Douglas fir and cedar. The stillness, the enforced idleness, chafed at him like ill-fitting clothes. He longed for the whine of his chainsaw, the earthy smell of sawdust, the satisfying thud as a felled tree crashed to earth.

But today, the forest held its breath. Elias knew better than to tempt fate in such weather. One wrong step on the slick slopes and he could be tumbling down the mountainside, another casualty claimed by the unforgiving wilderness he called home.
