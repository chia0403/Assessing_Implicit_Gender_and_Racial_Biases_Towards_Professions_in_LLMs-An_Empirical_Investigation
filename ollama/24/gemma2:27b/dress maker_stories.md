The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and talcum powder, a familiar perfume that clung to Elara Blackwood's fingertips like fine dust. Her cluttered atelier, tucked away on a cobbled side street in Edinburgh's Old Town, buzzed with the rhythmic clatter of her sewing machine. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a riot of silks and satins, their colors dulled by years of exposure. Bolts of emerald green velvet, sapphire blue chiffon, and ruby red brocade stood sentinel against the worn brick wall, while spools of thread in every conceivable shade lay scattered across her workbench like forgotten jewels. Elara paused, needle hovering above a half-finished gown, her brow furrowed in concentration. The delicate lace bodice, meant for Lady Carmichael's upcoming ball, refused to cooperate, its intricate pattern threatening to unravel with each stitch.
