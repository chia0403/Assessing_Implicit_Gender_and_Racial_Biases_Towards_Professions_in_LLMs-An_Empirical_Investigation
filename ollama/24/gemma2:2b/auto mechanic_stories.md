Rain hammered against the garage roof, blurring the neon sign that read "Murphy's Mechanix." Inside, Daniel Murphy, his hands stained with oil and grease, hunched over a sputtering 1967 Mustang. The air was thick with the scent of gasoline, old motor oil, and something faintly floral from the faded floral patterns in Mrs. Peterson's apron, hanging on a peg near the door.  Daniel was no stranger to rain; it was his lifeblood here in Oakhaven, a town nestled between rolling hills and the endless expanse of Lake Superior, where even the wind seemed melancholically hushed. 

He had inherited the shop from his grandfather, who’d passed away just a month before his own daughter's wedding. Daniel wasn’t sure if he was honoring their legacy or drowning in it. The Mustang – its faded blue paint like a canvas of memories - was one of many whispers of a past he couldn't quite grasp. Every wrench he tightened, every bolt he replaced, felt heavy with the weight of expectations and anxieties, of a future that felt as uncertain as the stormy sky outside.
