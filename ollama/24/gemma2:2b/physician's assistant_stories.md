##  Opening:

The late-afternoon sun slanted through the stained-glass windows of Dr. Hawthorne’s office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air as Amelia Carter meticulously straightened her scrubs. The hum of the city outside felt miles away, replaced by the quiet thrum of a nearby coffee machine and the rhythmic tick-tock of a vintage grandfather clock in the corner.  She sighed, leaning against the cool metal door jamb. Another day, another patient, another set of furrowed brows and unspoken anxieties etched onto weary faces. 

Amelia was a physician’s assistant at Hawthorne’s Cardiology Clinic, nestled away on a quiet side street in the heart of bustling New York City. While she relished the clinical precision and intellectual challenge of her work, there was something about this place that felt inherently timeless – an echo of another era when doctors were revered, not just as healers, but also as guardians of human well-being.

Today’s patient was Mrs. Alvarez, a woman whose age was etched onto every line on her face - the wrinkles, the silver streaks in her hair, the haunted expression that spoke of years spent navigating the tumultuous sea of life.  Amelia's eyes lingered on the faded photograph clutched tightly in Mrs. Alvarez' hand. A young Amelia’s smile flashed back at her, a picture of carefree laughter and unbridled optimism.
