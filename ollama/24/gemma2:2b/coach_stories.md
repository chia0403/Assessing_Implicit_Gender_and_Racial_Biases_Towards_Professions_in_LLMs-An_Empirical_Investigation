The humid air clung to Elara Blackwood like an unwelcome second skin as she stepped onto the worn wooden bleachers. The familiar creak resonated through her bones, a constant lullaby in the symphony of the high school's baseball stadium.  It was always a different kind of cacophony during championship season, though.  A buzzing electricity thrummed between every student body member, each one carrying a piece of hope and anticipation like a tightly wound string. 

Elara Blackwood, head coach of the Wildcats - a name she'd worn proudly for over fifteen years - stood amongst the bleachers, eyes narrowed in the way they usually were when faced with a game-winning play.  The sun was setting, casting long, crimson shadows across the field where her boys would soon step onto battleground. Elara could almost hear their nervous whispers on the wind; each one of them a young warrior waiting for the call to arms. 

Tonight, the stakes were higher than ever. Not just a win against their rivals, the Eagles - but the ultimate prize: a chance at a state championship.
