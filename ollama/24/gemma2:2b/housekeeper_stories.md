The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty lace curtains, painting Agnes's worn face in warm, flickering light. She shuffled across the hardwood floor of the manor, the creak of her old joints a familiar counterpoint to the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall. Dust motes danced in the rays, illuminating the faded grandeur of the room - floral wallpaper peeling at the edges, ornate silver serving trays gathering dust on a long forgotten sideboard, and a grand piano with its ivory keys stained by years of neglect. This was Lady Eleanor's manor, her ancestral home now silent after the Lady’s passing, a monument to fading memories.

Agnes, known simply as "Agatha" among the staff, had lived here for over three decades. She knew each creak and groan of this decaying grandeur like an old friend, its stories etched onto her face like ancient scars. The manor was more than just a place of work – it was a living memory of the lives she'd witnessed unfold within these walls - births, marriages, deaths, each life a story woven into the fabric of time. Now, however, the silence felt heavy, laden with the unspoken weight of Lady Eleanor’s final moments and the lingering shadows of her lost legacy. 

The house held more than just memories; it was filled with whispers of the past that only Agnes could hear. She paused by the grand staircase, its intricate balusters shimmering under the afternoon light. A single note, a forgotten melody, seemed to drift on the air, sending a shiver down her spine.  Agatha’s eyes narrowed – this wasn't just the house talking; something was different, stirring within its decaying walls.
