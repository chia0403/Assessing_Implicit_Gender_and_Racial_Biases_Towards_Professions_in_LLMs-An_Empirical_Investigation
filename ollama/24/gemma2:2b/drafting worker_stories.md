## The Blueprint for Disaster

**Setting:** A bustling industrial city in 1950s America, where towering factories belched smoke into the perpetually grey sky.  

**Main Character:**  Arthur "Artie" O’Malley, 28 years old, a draftsman by trade with calloused hands and the weary look of a man who has seen too many blueprints go bad in his time. He worked for Acme Engineering, a company notorious for pushing the edges of safety regulations and prioritizing profit over worker well-being. His office was tucked away on the top floor of the factory building, bathed in an unsettling mix of fluorescent lighting and the shadows cast by worn machinery that groaned with each passing day. 

**Opening:**  Artie slammed his fist down on his desk, scattering a pile of crumpled blueprints. "Another one," he muttered, eyes narrowed at a particularly horrifyingly detailed diagram for a new line of factory conveyors. The machine looked like something out of a nightmare - jagged metal beams stacked upon each other with the speed and efficiency that was Acme's specialty. 

"This time it’s going to be different,” Artie said aloud, his voice hoarse from days spent in this sterile environment, his gaze fixed on the blueprint. But as he started to redraw lines and calculations on a fresh sheet of paper, a tremor ran through his gut. It wasn't just the weight of responsibility for the safety of countless workers, it was something more visceral, something akin to a premonition that clung to him like the greasy residue from years spent hunched over blueprints and never quite knowing what lurked beneath their clean lines.
