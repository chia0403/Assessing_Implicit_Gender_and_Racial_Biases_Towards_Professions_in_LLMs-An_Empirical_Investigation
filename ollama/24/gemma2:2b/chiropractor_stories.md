## The Hum of Bones

The rhythmic thwack-thwack echoed through Dr. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's office like a heartbeat. Outside, San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge shimmered gold in the late afternoon sun, its silhouette stark against the darkening sky. Inside, however, Amy was consumed by the quiet hum of her patient’s spine. 

She adjusted the posture of Mr. Tanaka, an aging Japanese businessman with back pain so profound it felt like a trapped crow trying to escape its cage. His stoic expression was now tinged with an unfamiliar flicker of pain as Amy worked through his complex alignment. The tension in his neck tightened with every twist and turn. 

Amy's hand danced gently over Mr. Tanaka’s spine, the familiar feel of bone and cartilage a balm against the cacophony that was her mind. Today, amidst the usual symphony of clicks and pops, something felt different. A strange hum resonated through the room, as though unseen fingers were playing a discordant melody. 

Her gaze swept to the corner where a vintage record player sat, its needle frozen on a scratched vinyl record of Frank Sinatra's voice. Its faded cover bore the title "The Voice." Amy glanced at her clock – a ticking reminder of the approaching evening rush hour – then back at Mr. Tanaka's face. A small smile played on her lips. The hum was growing louder, and she knew she wasn’t alone tonight.
