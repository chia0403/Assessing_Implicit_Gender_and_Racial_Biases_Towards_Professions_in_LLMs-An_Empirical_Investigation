The wind whipped through Silas Finch's worn straw hat, tugging at his threadbare coat as he surveyed his fields. The sun, sinking below the horizon, painted the late summer sky in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple, casting long shadows over the rows of barley swaying like restless ghosts. This was the end of another day, but not one filled with the usual sense of satisfaction. Silas's weathered face etched with a weariness born from years spent battling nature's whims, his calloused hands trembling as he clutched a letter tightly. It was addressed to him, in handwriting that was both familiar and strange, bearing a peculiar wax seal that looked like the frozen tears of a frost-touched winter rose. 

This land - this humble farm in the shadow of the Iron Ridge Mountains - was all Silas had ever known. But as he stared at the letter clutched in his hand, its contents hinted at a life beyond these rolling fields. It spoke of an inheritance, of a legacy waiting to be discovered, a journey that would take him to lands far away, places where magic danced on the wind and whispered tales of forgotten gods. He closed his eyes, picturing his weathered hands working the soil, and then a vision of bustling city streets, towering monuments, swirling with life and unknown wonder, flashed across his mind. 

Silas Finch, son of a farmer, was about to become something else entirely.
