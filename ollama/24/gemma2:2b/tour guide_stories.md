The biting wind whipped through Evelyn Thornhill's hair, stinging her cheeks as she stood before the towering obsidian gates of Castle Blackwood. "Welcome to the most haunted place in Britain," she declared with a theatrical flourish, her voice barely audible above the howling gale. The flickering gaslights cast an ominous glow upon the crumbling stone facade, sending shivers down even the bravest visitor's spine. 

Evelyn Thornhill, known by all as 'Evie', was not just any tour guide; she was the descendant of Blackwood's former owner, a line that ran as thick and dark as the castle's veins. With generations of lore in her blood, she spun tales of phantom laughter echoing down deserted halls and restless spirits trapped within the ancient stones. Her tours weren't simply historical expeditions; they were journeys into the heart of the macabre. 

The guests huddled closer around their makeshift bonfire, a group of tourists seeking thrills and chills in equal measure. Tonight was a special night - a full moon bathed the castle in an unearthly silver light, making it feel both welcoming and terrifying at once. The air was heavy with anticipation.  Evelyn's smile widened as she took a deep breath, her eyes glinting with mischief. "Tonight," she whispered, "we are going to let the Blackwood spirit guide us."
