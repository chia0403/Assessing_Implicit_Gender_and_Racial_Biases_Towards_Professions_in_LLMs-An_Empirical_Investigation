The rain hammered against the glass windows of Arthur "Ace" Blackwood's office like an angry chorus. Outside, Chicago was in a storm. But inside, Ace felt more desolate than any tempest could bring. A stack of unopened life insurance policy applications sat on his desk, mocking him with their blank stares.  He was staring out at the grey cityscape for the sixth time since his shift had started, and each time, he saw only the reflection of a man drowning in an ocean of despair.

Ace wasn't always this way. He’d been a rising star in the insurance world, known for his sharp wit and uncanny ability to sell policies that were more than just financial instruments—they were promises whispered with hope into the ears of scared families, each one a unique tapestry woven by Ace himself. But then, tragedy struck.  His beloved wife, Clara, had died in a freak accident during their annual trip to Hawaii.  The grief was a living beast, gnawing at him, leaving behind only a hollow echo of the man he once was.

He'd poured his grief into his work, pushing through every day like it held some kind of promise – a chance to help others find comfort in what they believed were their final moments.  But that fire within him was starting to flicker, threatened by the constant barrage of requests, all filled with desperation and fear, which only made Ace's own sense of loss feel more profound. 

The storm outside seemed determined to stay for days. Inside, Ace felt like a ship caught in an endless wave of grief.  He had bills to pay, a mortgage to service, and the weight of his clients' hopes rested heavily on his shoulders. It was time to choose - drown in despair or fight for something, anything, more meaningful than surviving this life he'd been given.
