Rain lashed against the pharmacy windows, each drop like tiny needles pricking at the already-damp glass. Inside, the cozy aroma of cinnamon and vanilla hung heavy in the air, battling the cold seep of the storm outside.

For years, Elara's life had been an intricate tapestry woven from the mundane routine of dispensing prescriptions and helping customers with their ailments.

But tonight, something felt different. A heavy tension thrummed beneath the surface of the quiet evening. It wasnâ€™t just the storm; it was an unseen current in the air that seemed to prickle Elara's skin.
