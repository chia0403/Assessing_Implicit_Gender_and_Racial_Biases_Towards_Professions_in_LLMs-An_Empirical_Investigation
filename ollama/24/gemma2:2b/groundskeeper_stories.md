The late afternoon sun beat down on Elias Blackwood's worn face like a blacksmith's hammer, sending shimmers across the dust-coated grass of Thornhill Manor's sprawling gardens. A symphony of cicadas droned in the humid air, their chorus punctuated by the occasional chirp of a sparrow darting between hedges. He tugged at his floppy straw hat, sweat clinging to the worn brim and his brow creased with the fatigue of another long day. 

Elias Blackwood wasn't much for fancy words like "groundskeeper," or even "gardener." To him, it was just tending the place where he felt most alive. A tangled web of overgrown roses, whispering willows in the breeze, ancient oak trees draped in morning glories – Thornhill Manor held a world hidden within its stone walls that only Elias could truly appreciate. 

But today, something wasn't right. The usual symphony of nature seemed to have lost some of its harmony, replaced by an unnerving silence punctuated by the jarring crash of wood against metal.  He stood frozen, his hand unconsciously tightening around the trowel he was using to trim a patch of overgrown ivy, when he heard it again - a distinct clacking coming from deeper within the manor's heart – the place Elias had sworn never to venture into alone.
