Rain hammered against the windows of Clara Beaumont's office, a metronome counting down the minutes until her appointment with Mrs. Abernathy. The storm outside was a reflection of the turmoil inside Clara.  Her usually methodical mind felt like it was spinning at warp speed, each thought leaving a dizzying trail in its wake. 

Clara ran a hand through her damp hair, tucking a stray strand behind her ear, before settling on Mrs. Abernathy's file. The woman’s name was inscribed on the cover, stark white against a sea of muted, comforting blues and yellows.  A simple picture of a woman with kind eyes and a gentle smile stared back at Clara. Her file spoke of a world long ago – one she hadn't seen in years.  

The setting: a cozy, brick-lined office on the outskirts of a small town, nestled amidst the rolling hills of Vermont. The aroma of chamomile tea filled the air, a soothing balm to her anxious heart as she prepared for Mrs. Abernathy’s therapy session.

Clara's life had been built around order and precision: her days marked by schedules, appointments, and a quiet routine.  But now, as she sat waiting, her meticulously crafted world began to crack under the weight of an old secret, threatening to shatter everything she believed in.
