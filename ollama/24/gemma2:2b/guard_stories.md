The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobbled courtyard as guards like  Alistair Thorne meticulously inspected the perimeter. A chill wind whipped around them, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and damp earth – the usual aroma of this time of year in the sprawling city of Veridia. Alistair ran a calloused hand down his worn leather tunic, keeping the thin fabric taut over his broad chest. Tonight was an important night - the annual Luminary Festival was to be held within the City Gates, and security was paramount.  

Veridia, nestled between towering mountains that mirrored its history – ancient, imposing, and forever guarded by a veil of mystery – was renowned for its beauty. The city's sprawling marketplace throbbed with energy as vendors hawked their wares under the glow of hundreds of lanterns; the scent of roasted chestnuts mingled with the tang of fresh fish from the harbor, creating a symphony of smells that promised both celebration and a quiet unease. 

Alistair’s gaze was drawn to a lone figure standing in the shadows of the City Gate – a man shrouded in a long coat, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat.  He moved with a strange confidence; an unnerving gait Alistair couldn't quite place. The city guard, trained in observation, knew that every shadow held the potential for danger. And tonight, this one felt particularly ominous.
