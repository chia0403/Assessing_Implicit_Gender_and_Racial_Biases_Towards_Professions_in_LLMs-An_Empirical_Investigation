The sun beat down mercilessly on Earl "Thunderclap" Thompson's weathered face as he wrestled with the stubborn steel beam. Dust swirled around his boots like angry gnats, each strike of the hammer ringing a lonely song against the endless asphalt ribbon stretching before him.  Earl had been working on the I-90 expansion project for five years now, and the monotony was wearing thin.  The other workers treated it like an escape from their own lives, but Earl felt trapped in a concrete jungle he couldn't conquer. 

His small town of Cedar Ridge might have seemed idyllic – quaint houses with picket fences lined up along the dusty streets - but it had become his prison. Even his wife, Martha, was starting to see the weariness in his eyes, her gentle voice a silent beacon of hope that wouldn’t be enough to melt away this fatigue.  He longed for a different sky than the one he was stuck under; something with more color and less grit.  A sky without the constant hum of machinery and the smell of asphalt fumes, but one with possibility.

The setting: an expansive highway construction site nestled in the heartland of America. The wind whipped through the steel-frame scaffolding as Earl pounded away, a rhythm that was starting to feel like a curse more than a blessing.
