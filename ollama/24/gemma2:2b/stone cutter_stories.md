The wind whipped Amelia’s already messy hair around her face as she stood at the precipice of the mountain quarry. The air was thick with dust, carrying the smell of granite and sweat.  Below, the earth yawned open in a chaotic tapestry of gray-white rocks and veins of obsidian that promised both beauty and danger. At just 23, Amelia was already one of the most renowned stone cutters in the whole valley, her name whispered amongst the older generation as if it held some ancient magic. But tonight, even with years spent honing her craft, she found herself trembling. It wasn’t the cold mountain air or the sheer weight of responsibility for carving this monument of power - it was the silence. The quarry usually pulsed with the rhythmic thud of hammers and the chatter of men discussing their next cut, but tonight, a suffocating quiet blanketed everything like a shroud.  Her grandfather's words echoed in her head: “This stone has its own story to tell,” he had said, his eyes deep-set and wrinkled as they surveyed the granite before them. Tonight, Amelia knew she was about to uncover it.
