Rain hammered against the windows of The Rusty Mug like a battering ram. Inside, dust motes danced in the golden glow of the kerosene lamps, illuminating the worn oak bar, its surface scarred with stories etched into wood grain. The air hummed with the low thrum of conversation and the steady drip of beer from chipped glass. 

Barnaby "Barney" O'Malley, a burly man with calloused hands that could sling drinks faster than he could count freckles on a dog's back, surveyed the scene. He was a creature of routine, finding solace in the familiar patterns of his life – serving weary souls at The Rusty Mug, watching the clock tick like a metronome counting down to another storm, and listening to the endless saga of the town’s inhabitants unfold over a pitcher of lukewarm beer. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A strange unease settled upon him as he wiped down the bar with a rag stained brown from years of neglect, his usual grin replaced by a thoughtful frown. The door creaked open, ushering in a new face: a young woman with eyes as blue as sapphires and hair the color of spun moonlight. Her expression was a mix of fear and determination, her gaze flitting across the room before settling on Barney’s weathered face. This night, something was different. Something had shifted.
