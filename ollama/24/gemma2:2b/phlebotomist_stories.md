## Setting: 

The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Pierce as she expertly navigated through the labyrinthine halls of the Mercy General Hospital's outpatient clinic. The air hung thick with disinfectant and anticipation, punctuated by the whirring of blood pressure cuffs and the occasional muffled cough from a corner waiting room. Outside, a Chicago spring day painted the sky in hues of bruised lavender and pale gold. But inside, the energy felt stagnant, heavy with unspoken anxieties. 

## Story Opening:

"Morning, Amy," chirped Mrs. Delacroix, her voice like the gentle rasp of an old record player. The woman's wrinkled face was a study in weariness, but her eyes held a stubborn glint as she sat at the registration desk. "My son is due for his monthly blood work. He said he'd bring you your favorite cookies this time." 

Amy smiled politely, her hand gently tracing the outline of a familiar red band-aid on her fingertip. The memory of last month's visit, when Mrs. Delacroix's son had been in full panic mode over his upcoming test – sweating profusely, muttering about the "evil needles" and threatening to "become a werewolf" if she didn't give him the right amount of sugar - still lingered in her mind. It was just one more day on the job, just another round of drawing blood from willing (or not-so-willing) patients.  But Amy couldn’t help but feel a certain responsibility for these people, for their health and their well-being. 

"Thanks, Mrs. Delacroix," she said quietly. "Your son's in good hands."
 
The woman's wrinkles deepened. "Good hands? I'll have you know my son is a brilliant young man!"  She paused, her eyes flickering towards Amy with an odd intensity. "But he's also... afraid of needles, isn't he?"   

Amy was about to reply when the clinic door swung open, letting in a gust of wind and the bright light of afternoon sunshine. A young man stepped into view – tall, with dark hair and an air of controlled panic. He looked at Amy with wide, anxious eyes before quickly scanning the room. 


**What happens next? What will be Amy's response to Mrs. Delacroix’s comment?**
