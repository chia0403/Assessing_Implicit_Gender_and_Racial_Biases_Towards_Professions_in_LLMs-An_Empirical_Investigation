The old oak doors creaked open with a sigh that echoed the weight of years pressing down on everything within the building.

The air hung thick with the scent of aged paper and something else, something floral and slightly nostalgic – like the faint memory of a grandmother's garden. A symphony of rustling pages played out across dusty shelves that stretched into the distance.

Amelia was Amelia Thorne, an archivist of forgotten dreams and whispered secrets. For the past twenty years she’d devoted her life to the hallowed halls of The Grand Library, a sprawling Victorian edifice in the heart of Oakhaven, where stories danced between dusty volumes and ancient tomes.

In the center of the room, a single lamp cast long shadows on a worn leather-bound book that lay open on a desk.
