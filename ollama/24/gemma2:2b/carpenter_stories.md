## Setting:  The Saltwind Coast

The wind, smelling perpetually of brine and woodsmoke, whipped Agnes' braids against her face as she stood on the rickety wooden pier. Sand seeped into her worn boots, clinging to them like memories. The salty tang of the sea filled her lungs, a taste sheâ€™d grown accustomed to over years spent crafting her craft in this remote fishing village on the Saltwind Coast.

Agnes Hawthorne was known throughout the village for two things: her intricate birdhouses carved from old driftwood and her sharp wit, which could disarm even the most stubborn fisherman with equal ease. Today, however, Agnes felt a knot of dread tighten in her stomach as she looked out at the churning sea. 

It wasn't just the storm brewing. It was something deeper: a creeping unease that had settled over her like a thick fog since the news reached their small community - a ship carrying refugees from the mainland had crashed against the treacherous rocks, its crew lost in the icy waters of the North Sea.  
 
The storm was coming, and with it, Agnes knew, an unquiet peace would descend upon them all. A peace that she feared was as deceptive as the calm before a tempest.
