## The Accountant's Shadow

**Setting:**  A bustling, historic port city named Atheria nestled between rolling green hills and the unforgiving grey expanse of the ocean. 

**Main Character:** Evelyn "Eve" Thorne, an accountant with silver hair tucked neatly beneath her fedora and eyes that hold the depth of a thousand ship voyages. She lived for order, precision, and the quiet hum of the ledger in her office, but lately, even the familiar rustle of paper couldn't soothe the creeping unease within her.

**Opening:**  Eve stared out her small window at the ceaseless churn of Atheria’s harbor.  Ships sailed in and out like restless spirits, each one a promise and a threat wrapped in worn ropes and weathered wood. She felt like one of them, tethered to this place she'd sworn to leave behind - not just for her job, but for her family. Yet, she couldn't escape the lingering whisper in her soul: something was amiss. 

A sudden jolt from the floorboards made Eve jump, the rhythmic click-clack of an old clock echoing through her small office.  She knew that sound. The one they called the ‘Watcher’s Tick'.  It marked a specific pattern, a rhythm only those in the city's underbelly understood: a harbinger of trouble, of secrets left to fester and rise like the tide itself.
