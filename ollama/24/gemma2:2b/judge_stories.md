## The Gavel's Weight

**Setting:**  A bustling court in Savannah, Georgia, circa 1870. Whispers echo through the grand courtroom filled with anticipation; cobblestones beneath the courthouse steps echo the rhythm of nervous footfalls. Sunlight streams through stained glass windows, casting an ethereal glow over the aged oak desk and the weathered gavel resting on it.  

**Character:** **Judge Eleanor Ashworth**, a woman whose face, etched by years of wielding the law's power, held both steely resolve and weary resignation.  She adjusted her spectacles with practiced ease, her eyes taking in the assembled crowd.  Her crisp white wig stood straight against the backdrop of swirling silk drapes, a silent testament to the solemnity of the occasion.

**Opening Lines:**  "Your Honor," began Assistant District Attorney William Thorne's voice, strained and sharp. He gestured towards a heavily draped table at the center of the courtroom where a young man sat chained, his face pale and etched with fear. "My client stands accused of a crime so heinous it leaves a stain on our city’s conscience.” 
 
The room hushed as Thorne continued. His words hung in the air like frost before the storm, each syllable carrying the weight of justice, of history, of secrets that ran deeper than the murky currents of the Savannah River. The gavel's heavy weight felt symbolic within Eleanor's hand – it represented not only authority but also the burden she carried daily as she navigated the moral minefield within her courtroom.
