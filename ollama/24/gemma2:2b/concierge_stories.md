The crisp, white linen suit felt stiflingly formal on Theodore “Theo” Winthrop’s lean frame. He adjusted his tie as he surveyed the grand foyer of the Astor Manor – its gilded chandeliers casting elongated shadows across polished marble floors. Each day brought the same routine: welcoming guests, tending to their whims, and occasionally retrieving a rogue sock from the laundry chute (a feat he’d mastered after an unfortunate incident with Mrs. Peabody's poodle). He yearned for something more than the endless cycle of service.

Theo's gaze lingered on the grand portrait of Astor himself, his stern eyes seeming to follow him. The man in the painting, a ruthless titan of industry, was a distant echo of Theo’s own yearning for ambition. 
**Setting:**  The Astor Manor - a sprawling Victorian mansion nestled amidst the bustling streets of New York City. It boasts opulent interiors, manicured gardens, and a history steeped in secrecy and intrigue.
**Main character:** Theodore "Theo" Winthrop - A concierge at the Astor Manor, striving to break free from his routine and achieve something more than the comfortable life he's accustomed to.
