## Opening

Rain hammered against the panoramic windows of Elias Thorne's penthouse office in Chicago.  A symphony of thunder echoed through the city as the wind whipped off Lake Michigan, its icy bite carrying with it the scent of salt and impending storm.  Within the steel cage of his trading floor, a kaleidoscope of screens flickered to life, each one a testament to the relentless churn of the stock market. Elias Thorne, a man who'd traded the warmth of a fireplace for the cold steel of his office chair, was on the verge of something monumental. 

Elias wasn't just another stockbroker; he possessed an uncanny intuition, a sixth sense that allowed him to read the subtle shifts in the market like weather patterns. Tonight, however, felt different. A creeping unease hung thick like the humidity clinging to the city air. This was no ordinary storm brewing on Wall Street; this was something... larger.
