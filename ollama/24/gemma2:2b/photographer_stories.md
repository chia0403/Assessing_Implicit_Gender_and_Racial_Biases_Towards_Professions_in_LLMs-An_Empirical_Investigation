## The Light That Bleeds

**Setting:**  A decaying Victorian mansion on the windswept clifftops of Cornwall. The air is thick with salt spray and a perpetual drizzle lingers like a ghost's breath. A lone lighthouse stands sentinel against the churning grey ocean, its beam slicing through the storm clouds. 

**Main Character:** Elara Thorne, a photographer known for her ethereal portraits that seemed to capture not just human forms but the very essence of their souls. She was haunted by shadows – both literally and figuratively –  a secret she hid behind her ever-present camera lens and carefully constructed persona.

Elara knelt on the creaky porch floor, the biting wind whipping strands of hair across her face. The storm had raged for days, a tempest mirroring the turmoil within her own heart. She held the worn leather-bound journal in her hands, its pages filled with cryptic entries and half-formed sketches that seemed to mock her own stagnant life. 

The words echoed the unsettling imagery she captured through her lens – images of forgotten landscapes, spectral light trails on the storm-tossed waters, faces obscured by rain and shadows. Each photograph felt like a piece of her soul bleeding onto paper, yet every attempt at creating something meaningful seemed to end in an echo of the darkness inside. 

She lifted her gaze to the lighthouse's flickering beam, its pale glow almost swallowed by the storm clouds. There, she saw it - a single tear roll down the weathered stone face of the building's facade. A melancholic image, starkly beautiful and strangely haunting. Just like Elara herself.


**Next:** What leads Elara to explore this abandoned house?
