The air hung thick with the scent of sugar and cinnamon, an aroma that usually brought Elara joy but today was laced with melancholy. The early morning mist clinging to the cobblestone streets of Oldhaven felt even more oppressive than usual as she meticulously dusted flour onto a tray of delicate pastries.  Elara "Lark" Baker, fourth generation baker at her family's century-old shop "The Golden Bread," had been known for her creations since before anyone could truly remember. 

Today's pastries were for the Grand Market celebration - their usual flamboyant displays were being held back by a sudden downpour. A gust of wind, sharp and cold, whipped through the open doorway, scattering stray crumbs across the floorboards. It was as if the very spirit of Oldhaven was whispering in Elaraâ€™s ear: "There's trouble brewing."  The storm had arrived on a day when everything felt too perfect. Too quiet. Too calm.
