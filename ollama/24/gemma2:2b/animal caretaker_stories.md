The midday sun beat down on Harmony’s back as she knelt, coaxing a particularly stubborn squirrel to eat its breakfast of sunflower seeds.  Her straw hat tilted precariously over her eyes as she glanced up at the sprawling oak tree that housed her current responsibility: a family of raccoons with an insatiable curiosity and even more insatiable appetites. This wasn't Harmony’s first rodeo - tending to wild creatures was something in her blood, a legacy passed down from generations of animal caretakers before her.  She lived on the edge of Redwood National Park, where towering redwood forests met the open ocean.  

Harmony sighed softly, tucking a stray strand of red hair behind her ear. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, punctuated by the raspy chirps of birds flitting between branches.  It was a peaceful day, a welcome respite from the chaos and bustle of city life that often clung to Harmony’s heels like a shadow. But beneath this peaceful facade, she knew the truth - there was an undercurrent of unease, a subtle shift in the usual quiet harmony of Redwood Creek. The air held an unspoken tension, a prickling sensation on her skin as if something vast and ominous was brewing in the shadows.
