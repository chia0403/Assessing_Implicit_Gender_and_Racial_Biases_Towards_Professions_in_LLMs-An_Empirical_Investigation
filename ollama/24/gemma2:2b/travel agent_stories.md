The whirring of the espresso machine was the only sound that dared compete with the incessant hammering of Elara’s heart against her ribs.  She ran a hand through her windswept auburn hair, already dusted in flour from earlier that morning when she'd tried to salvage one of Mr. Jenkins' elaborate sugar cookie designs before his daughter, Emily, turned them into edible sculptures on their kitchen counter. 

Elara was known for more than just the meticulous chaos that followed her around, however.  Her business, "Wanderlust and Whispers", was a haven for travelers yearning for something more than the usual tourist traps. Elara believed in crafting personalized journeys, tailoring itineraries to each client’s soul instead of simply ticking off must-see locations on some dusty map. She sat at her mahogany desk, surrounded by travel brochures that whispered stories of faraway lands and ancient ruins, a city map crumpled between her hands.  The name she held so close to her heart seemed like an impossible dream: The Whispering Sands of Morocco. It was supposed to be the next big thing for her business, but Mr. Jenkins’ bakery had other plans – his daughter's sugar-fueled frenzy hadn't helped matters. 


**Setting:** A quaint, yet chaotic, travel agency office nestled in a quiet corner of Portland.  The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and cinnamon lingering in the air mingled with the faint scent of exotic spices from Elara’s latest book about India she had been diligently preparing for her upcoming client meeting.
