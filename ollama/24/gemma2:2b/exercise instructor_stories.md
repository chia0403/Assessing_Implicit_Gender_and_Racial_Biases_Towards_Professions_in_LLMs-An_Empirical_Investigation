## The Iron Room

Rain lashed against the windowpanes, a relentless drumming that mimicked the thrumming in Elena Ramirez's chest.  Her small studio apartment, usually filled with the warm glow of sunshine streaming through her stained glass windows and the gentle hum of music from her old boombox, felt suffocated by the storm's fury. Outside, she watched the city skyline recede into a grey silhouette against the encroaching darkness.

Elena had always loved the quiet hum of her exercise studio, "Iron Heart" -  a haven away from the chaotic symphony of the real world. Her passion for fitness was infectious, and her students, from first-timers to seasoned athletes, found solace in her guidance. 

Tonight, though, the usual calm felt fractured. It wasn't the storm; it was something deeper, a knot forming in her stomach that mirrored the ever-growing pressure on her shoulders.  The studio door creaked open, and a familiar figure stepped in.

"Hey," said James, his eyes crinkled at the corners as he always did when he had a story to tell. "How's it going?"
