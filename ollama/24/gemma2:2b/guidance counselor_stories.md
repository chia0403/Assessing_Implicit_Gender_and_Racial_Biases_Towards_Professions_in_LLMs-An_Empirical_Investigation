The air in Mr. Thorne's office smelled like old paper and forgotten dreams, an aroma that always seemed to linger even after he was gone. He liked it - a tangible reminder of the countless lives he had touched during his 20 years as the guidance counselor at Westview High. Now, though, only Mrs. Henderson, a harried woman in her late fifties with tired eyes and a perpetually knotted purse strap, sat across from him. "It feels like a lifetime ago," she sighed, staring at a crumpled letter clutched in her hand. The once vibrant blue paint of the desk seemed to droop under the weight of the sorrow in her voice. 

**Name:** Mr. Anthony Thorne
**Setting:** Westview High School - A suburban high school with aging brick walls and creaky doors, seemingly untouched by time.  It sits on the edge of a quiet cul-de-sac in a town obsessed with tradition and reluctant to embrace change.   


This is where Mr. Thorne begins his story, a story about lost dreams, unexpected choices, and finding hope in the most unlikely places.
