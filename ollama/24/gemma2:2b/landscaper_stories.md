##  A Garden in Grief

**Setting:** A quaint cottage nestled amongst ancient oaks, their gnarled branches forming a canopy over the property. This is the home of Elias Thorne, a man whose life was once as fertile and vibrant as the gardens he tended. Now, however, his world feels as barren and unforgiving as the winter grass underfoot. 

**Character:** Elias Thorne - A man weathered by time, his hands calloused from years spent coaxing life from earth. Once renowned for his meticulous landscaping skills, Elias now struggles to maintain the once-proud garden of his late wife, Amelia.  She’d been a woman who breathed life into everything she touched, her spirit as vibrant and untamed as the wildflowers she'd cultivated in their neglected backyard.

The first snowfall of the season had fallen overnight, coating the oak trees with a thick blanket of white. Elias watched from the porch, his gaze fixed on the frost clinging to the rose bushes. A familiar ache swelled in his chest - Amelia's favourite rose bush, the one she'd meticulously pruned and trained for years, now stood defiant but lifeless. Its blooms, once bursting forth like crimson flames, lay limp and gray under a frozen veil of snow. The memory was a cruel reminder of the vibrant life he’d lost, of the love that had blossomed in the earth. 

He ran a callused hand over his hair, the cold biting at his skin. This winter, grief wasn't just a heavy weight on his heart; it was a chill seeping into every corner of his being.  Each day felt like an endless cycle of tending to Amelia’s garden, a chore designed to keep him tethered to a life he no longer fully understood. 


He pulled out the worn, leather-bound journal, its pages filled with Amelia's elegant script and their shared memories. Her words seemed to whisper in his ears, urging him to remember, to find solace in the past, while the present remained a desolate wasteland.  
 

“Perhaps,” he murmured to the silent garden, “it’s time to rebuild.”
