The midday sun beat down on the bustling market square of Marrakech, turning the cobblestones into shimmering mirages.  Inside "Nourish," Amelia's small clinic was a cool oasis of green tiles and calming aromas of cinnamon and saffron. It was here she spent her days navigating the complex world of food and health, one meal plan at a time. Amelia Lawson, MS, RD, LDN - not just another dietician in a sea of "wellness" fads -  had built a life based on science and compassion. 

She glanced at the clock, the red hand ticking towards her next appointment. The rhythmic clinking of pots and pans from a nearby street vendor broke through the calm, reminding Amelia of the vibrancy of Marrakech's heartbeat. The aroma of fresh tagines wafted in from one corner of the shop, a stark contrast to the sterile smells she was used to. She adjusted the scarf around her neck and smiled - today's patient would bring yet another challenge to this vibrant city.
