## The Smell of Iron

The sun dipped behind the brick facades of the city, casting long shadows across the cobblestones of St. Albans market square.  A haze of smoke from nearby coal fires mingled with the scent of fresh blood and sizzling meat - an unappealing yet inevitable perfume for Bartholomew "Bart" Hemlock, proprietor of Hemlock's Hides and Meats. 

It was a Tuesday, the day Bart found his rhythm amidst the cacophony of vendors hawking their wares: from pungent cheeses to shimmering silks, the market pulsated with life, even in the dying light.  The rhythmic clang of his cleaver against bone, the satisfying thud as meat yielded to his knife, it was all a part of the dance he performed with precision and passion every day. He'd grown up surrounded by this chaos; his father had taught him how to make the perfect cut, how to read the lean and fat of an animal, how to tell its story in each piece of meat. But today, something felt different. 

The familiar buzz of the market was a muted hum beneath a deeper anxiety that gnawed at Bart's chest. The air held a new scent, not the usual metallic tang of blood and sweat, but one tinged with fear and an underlying, creeping unease.
