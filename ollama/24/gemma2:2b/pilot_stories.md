The desert wind whipped at Amelia "Ace" Hawthorne's face as she leaned out of her cockpit, watching the crimson sun sink into the horizon. Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, their chaotic patterns mocking the controlled chaos she knew to be essential for safe landings.  The setting sun cast long shadows over the dry lake bed where her transport plane was parked, a lonely silhouette against the fiery sky. The "Starlight" was Amelia's pride and joy, a sleek silver seabird designed to traverse the unforgiving sands of the Atacama Desert. 

Tonight's mission: evacuate supplies for a research team trapped by a sandstorm in the remote Altiplano region.  Amelia adjusted her goggles, scanning the sky for any signs of turbulence. This was no ordinary flight; tonight, she wasn't just delivering supplies. Tonight, she was carrying the hopes of a research program striving to understand and harness the power of Earth's ancient energy - an energy that had long been whispered about in hushed tones among scientists and explorers alike.
