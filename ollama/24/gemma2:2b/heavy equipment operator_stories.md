## Story Opening

The sun beat down on Rex "Ravage" Riley's neck like an angry blacksmith hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, each drop leaving a tiny film across his weathered face. The air hung thick and heavy with dust from the abandoned quarry, remnants of countless days spent coaxing life out of metal giants.  Rex was used to it. He’d learned the grit, the roar, the smell of diesel that clung to every crevice of his soul. 

He'd been a Ravager since he could drive anything on four wheels, and even before that, he wrestled control over the heavy beasts with an almost primal understanding. The old Volvo bulldozer hummed in response to his commands, its massive blade scraping across the dusty earth like a giant's tooth. 

The site was silent except for the engine’s steady drone.  Today's task was simple: clear a stretch of the quarry, preparing ground for a new housing development. It felt like another day swallowed by routine, another brick in the never-ending wall of progress. Yet, Rex knew, just as he'd known since first holding his father’s worn leather gloves, that there was more to life than the endless grind of machines and concrete.  There was a hunger for something deeper, an echoing call from the heart of the earth itself.


**Setting:** An abandoned quarry in the middle of nowhere. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the land. 

**Main Character:** Rex "Ravage" Riley: A heavy equipment operator who lives and breathes his work, seeking meaning beyond its routine.
