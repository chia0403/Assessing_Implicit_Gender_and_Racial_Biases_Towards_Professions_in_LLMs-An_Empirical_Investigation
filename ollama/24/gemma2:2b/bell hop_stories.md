The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of sweat and stale cigar smoke as Arthur Bellington meticulously polished his starched white uniform. His shift at the Grand Zenith Hotel in San Diego wasn't exactly glamorous, but it was steady work, and the late-night hum of conversations and clattering heels provided a symphony for the weary soul. It was 1947, after all, and America's heart was still beating with wartime optimism.

Arthur, tall and thin with hands calloused from years of hauling luggage and maneuvering his way through a maze of bustling hotel guests, surveyed his domain â€“ Room 302.  A crumpled sheet lay on the worn carpet, and a lone suitcase sat forgotten by the window, its occupant seemingly lost in the swirling haze of the city lights. Arthur adjusted his tie and checked himself in the reflection of the brass doorknob - ready for another night, another round of misplaced hopes and whispered secrets exchanged under a California sky.
