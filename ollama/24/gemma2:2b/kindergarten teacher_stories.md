## Story Opening: 

**Setting:** Mrs. Eloise Peabody's kindergarten classroom in Oakhaven Elementary School, sunny Wednesday afternoon.  The air hangs thick with crayon smells, dried glue stick residue, and the faintest hint of play-doh that never seems to quite disappear. Outside, children’s laughter spills out onto the street like dandelion seeds.  Inside, Mrs. Peabody's eyes are narrowed as she stares intently at a chart on her wall - a colorful representation of the alphabet. Her brow furrows with an unsettling mix of frustration and hope.

**Main Character:**  Eloise Peabody (Mrs. E.P.) is a woman who believes in order and routine. She’s spent years meticulously building her classroom, creating a world where every crayon color has a designated spot on its own shelf and each piece of paper finds its perfect place in the filing cabinet. Eloise's dedication to structure often borders on obsession, but it also makes her students feel safe and secure. 

**Opening Line:**  "The letters, they just... wouldn’t cooperate," Mrs. Peabody muttered under her breath, a single strand of auburn hair escaping its neat ponytail and falling across her brow. "It's as if the whole alphabet has decided to run away from me."
