## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the battered tin roof of the abandoned warehouse like tiny fists pounding on wood. Inside, Finnigan "Finn" Donovan hunched over his tools, rain soaking through his worn coveralls and into his aching bones. The wind howled around him, a mournful song echoing the emptiness that gnawed at his chest. It was a familiar ache, one he'd learned to live with since losing his wife two years ago. But tonight, it felt heavier, more insistent than usual. 

Finn ran a calloused hand over the worn leather strap of his toolbox - his life, his livelihood, all contained within those battered metal confines.  He'd always prided himself on keeping things close at hand, on being ready for anything. Now, standing amidst piles of debris and rusted machinery, he felt strangely adrift, his usual sense of control slipping away like water through a sieve. 


**Setting:** A derelict warehouse in a forgotten corner of the city, repurposed as an illegal speakeasy during Prohibition.  Years later, the building is shrouded in whispers and shadowed memories. Finn works tirelessly on its crumbling structure, piecing together his own life amidst the wreckage.

**Main Character:** Finnigan "Finn" Donovan - A man weathered by time and hardship, carrying the weight of loss with quiet dignity.
