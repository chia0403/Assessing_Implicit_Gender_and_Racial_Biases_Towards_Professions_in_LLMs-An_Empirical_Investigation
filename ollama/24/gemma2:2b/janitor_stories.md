Rain lashed against the windows of The Grand Blackwood Manor, each drop exploding in miniature geysers on the dusty glass. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale wine and unfulfilled dreams.  The flickering gaslight cast long, distorted shadows across the opulent yet decaying ballroom. Here, amidst the dust motes dancing in the dim light, stood Elias Finch, a man whose life had been as much defined by this manor as the dust beneath his worn-out shoes.

Elias was no stranger to the melancholic atmosphere of The Blackwood. He'd spent decades as its humble janitor, sweeping away the ghosts of forgotten celebrations and lost passions.  His days were marked by monotonous routines: polishing silver that never seemed to gleam, emptying overflowing ashtrays that housed only forgotten cigarettes, and cleaning up spilled champagne with a sadness mirroring his own life. 

Tonight, though, something was different. A palpable tension hung in the air, heavy like a shroud draped over the grand staircase. Even Elias' usually indifferent eyes held a flicker of apprehension as he saw her. She stood at the top of the stairs, bathed in the fading light. Her back to him, she seemed to be lost in the depths of contemplation, her silhouette an echo of a forgotten beauty.  He knew this woman wasn't a ghost; something told him she was a living embodiment of despair. 


His heart thumped against his ribs like a caged bird. Tonight was not just another night at The Blackwood. Tonight, Elias had a feeling he would never be the same again.
