The humid Mississippi air clung to Detective Elias "Eli" Grant like a wet blanket as he surveyed the scene.  He pushed back his thinning, silver-streaked hair, its shadow falling over the worn denim jacket he wore even when it felt stiflingly hot. The boarded-up storefront on Main Street was a stark silhouette against the setting sun, its paint peeling away in strips like ancient skin. 

Eli wasn't new to tragedy.  He had seen enough darkness in his twenty years on the force to fill an entire cemetery. But this caseâ€¦this felt different. The air itself seemed thick with unspoken emotions, the kind that lingered like the ghost of a forgotten dream. This was more than just another unsolved robbery; it was a gaping wound on the heart of their small town, a town already drowning in grief from the recent murder of Sheriff Thompson.  Eli needed answers, not only for the sake of justice but for the hope he clung to like a lifeline. He knew the answer would come, perhaps as an echo, perhaps as a scream.
