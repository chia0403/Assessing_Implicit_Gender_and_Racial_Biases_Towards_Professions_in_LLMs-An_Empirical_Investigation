The wind whipped around Daniel "Sparky" Lawson's face, carrying with it the acrid scent of burning cedarwood and a gritty tang that always reminded him of the fight for survival.  He squinted against the glare, his eyes settling on the flickering plume of orange and red against the backdrop of an unforgiving twilight sky.  The mountains beyond the small town of Havenwood were shrouded in mist, their peaks seeming to bleed into the encroaching darkness.  He adjusted his helmet's chin strap, a worn leather relic from years spent battling blazes both large and small. 

Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, it wasn't just another wildfire that demanded his attention. There was an unsettling stillness in the air, a chilling silence that felt as ominous as the flames themselves.  The usual chatter of crickets had faded into an almost unnatural quiet, replaced by a bone-chilling hum emanating from the heart of the inferno. It wasn’t the roaring flames that troubled Sparky, but the strange, distorted whispers he heard coming from within the monstrous blaze.
