The rain hammered against the cracked windowpane, blurring the neon lights of Chinatown into a kaleidoscope of sickly hues.  Inside "Lucky's" dimly lit office, the aroma of old paper and stale coffee hung heavy in the air. Detective Ethan "Eamon" Sullivan, his trench coat damp from the downpour, tapped his fingers against the worn wooden table. 

Across from him sat Mrs. Lin, her face pinched like a crumpled piece of paper.  The once vibrant silk qipao she wore now seemed to cling to her as if trying to hold back the despair within her eyes. "My husband," she whispered, her voice cracking with barely suppressed sobs, "He's gone missing." 

"Missing? Since when did you last see him, Mrs. Lin?" Eamon asked, his voice a calm baritone that belied the storm raging outside and the turmoil brewing inside his own chest. He knew this was only another puzzle piece in a larger mystery, one he had been forced to take on for reasons as murky and elusive as the fog swirling through the city.  

"Five days ago," she whispered. "My husband, Mr. Kai Lin, he was supposed to meet me at the teahouse. But I never saw him."
