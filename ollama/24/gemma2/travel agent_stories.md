The scent of coconut sunscreen and salt air hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of stale coffee from the overpriced cafe across the street. Amelia Josephine "Amy" Finch sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  Her office, a cramped cubbyhole nestled between a failing bakery and a bustling laundromat, was anything but tropical paradise. The window offered a view of grimy sidewalks and overflowing trash cans, a stark contrast to the vibrant postcards depicting pristine beaches and azure waters that plastered her walls. 

Amy dreamt of those places, those impossible dreams sold on glossy brochures and whispered promises. She lived vicariously through her clients, crafting their itineraries with meticulous care, each detail a tiny escape from the mundane reality of her own life. But sometimes, staring at the chipped paint peeling from the walls of her office, she wondered if she'd ever get to experience those wonders herself.
