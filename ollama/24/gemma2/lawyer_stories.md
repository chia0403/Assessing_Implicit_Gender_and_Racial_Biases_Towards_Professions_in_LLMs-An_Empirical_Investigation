The air in Penelope Evangeline "Penny" Hawthorne's office felt thick with the scent of old parchment and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the Manhattan skyline into an impressionistic watercolor of greys and blacks. Penny sat perched on the edge of her mahogany desk, chin resting on a fist, staring at the file before her. It was a tangled mess of medical records, police reports, and tear-stained letters - the case of Daniel Hayes, a small-time art dealer accused of murdering his wife with a priceless Ming vase. 

Penny wasn't sure what gnawed at her more: the absurdity of the accusation or the palpable grief radiating from the file like an invisible aura. This was a woman who had poured her heart and soul into building a life with Daniel, not just as his wife, but also as his business partner. The thought of her planning his demise felt...wrong.  

Penny knew she needed to get to the bottom of this. But how could you unravel a lie when truth itself seemed fractured, lost in the shadows cast by love and betrayal?
