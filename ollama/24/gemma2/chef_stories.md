The humid Miami air clung to Chef Catalina Ramirez like a second skin as she surveyed her domain.  Sunlight, filtered through the gauzy curtains, painted warm stripes across the polished mahogany counters of her restaurant, "El Sol de la Noche" - The Sun of the Night. Outside, on Calle Ocho, the rhythm of salsa pulsed through the open windows, mingling with the clatter of dishes and the murmur of conversation. Catalina inhaled deeply, the scent of simmering sofrito and roasting cumin a comforting symphony to her senses. 

Her restaurant was her heart, her passion poured into every perfectly plated dish, every expertly chosen ingredient. But tonight, something felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the usual vibrant energy, a knot in Catalina's stomach that she couldn't quite untangle.
