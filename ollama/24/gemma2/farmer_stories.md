The sun clawed its way over the horizon, casting long shadows across the dew-kissed fields of Amelia Rose Thistlewick's farm. The rooster, Bartholomew, had already begun his morning serenade, a shrill cry that echoed through the quiet valley. A symphony of rustling leaves and buzzing insects followed as the day breathed itself into existence. 

Amelia, her calloused hands wrapped around a steaming mug of coffee, stood on the porch of her farmhouse, watching the world awaken. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and freshly cut hay. This was her haven, this sprawling expanse of land she'd inherited from her grandfather. It was in her blood, this life of tending crops, raising livestock, and battling the elements with grit and determination.  This year, though, felt different. A restlessness thrummed beneath Amelia's skin, a yearning for something beyond the familiar rhythm of farm life.
