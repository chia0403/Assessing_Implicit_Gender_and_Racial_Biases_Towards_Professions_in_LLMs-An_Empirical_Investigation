The insistent drip-drip-drip echoed in Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlebottom's ears, a rhythmic counterpoint to the incessant honking of the traffic snaking its way through downtown Seattle.  He squinted at his reflection in the rain-streaked window of his beat-up van, a testament to years spent navigating tight alleyways and dodging rogue potholes. His nameplate, emblazoned with "Thistlebottom Plumbing: When It Flows We Know," seemed more ironic than ever.

The source of the relentless dripping lay inside a converted Victorian mansion now serving as a trendy co-working space. Bart imagined the high-powered executives huddled in their glass-walled offices, blissfully unaware of the impending plumbing apocalypse brewing behind a cracked tile in the communal bathroom. He sighed, adjusting his tool belt and pushing open the van door. Another day, another leaky faucet.


He stepped onto the slick pavement, a symphony of city sounds enveloping him: the rumble of buses, the chatter of pedestrians, the insistent beep of car horns. Rain continued to fall, turning the cobblestone streets into rivers reflecting the dim glow of neon signs. The air was thick with the scent of wet asphalt and distant coffee brewing, a peculiar aroma that Bart had come to associate with his life's work: fixing what was broken, one pipe at a time.
