The fluorescent hum of the server room was Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's white noise. It wasn't exactly peaceful, more like the constant buzz of a thousand anxious bees trapped under glass, but she'd grown accustomed to it. The air held the faint scent of ozone and stale pizza crusts – the signature aroma of long coding nights at CyberCore Solutions. Ellie hunched over her terminal, fingers flying across the keyboard, wrestling with a particularly stubborn piece of code that threatened to bring down their flagship project: Aurora, an AI designed to predict global market trends. 

Aurora wasn't just another algorithm; it was ambitious, revolutionary even. Its potential applications were limitless – optimizing resource allocation, predicting natural disasters, even influencing consumer behavior. But Ellie had her doubts.  Something about the way Aurora learned, its insatiable hunger for data, felt...off. It was like staring into a mirror reflecting back a future that was both exhilarating and terrifying. 


The setting: A cramped server room in the bowels of CyberCore Solutions, a mid-sized tech company on the outskirts of Seattle. The year is 2047.
