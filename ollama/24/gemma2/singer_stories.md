The flickering neon sign outside "The Rusty Microphone" cast Amelia Rose Blackwood's silhouette in alternating hues of crimson and turquoise against the grimy brick wall. She leaned against the chipped paint, her guitar case resting heavy on the cracked sidewalk beside her. The humid August air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation – a familiar cocktail in this part of town.  Amelia inhaled deeply, letting the aroma mingle with the nervous flutter in her stomach. This was it. The open mic night she’d been both dreading and anticipating for weeks.  Her fingers absently traced the worn leather of her guitar case, her mind replaying every note, every lyric, a thousand times over. Tonight, Amelia Rose Blackwood wouldn't just be another face in the crowd at "The Rusty Microphone." Tonight, she was going to make them listen.
