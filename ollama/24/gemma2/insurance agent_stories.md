The midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Elm Street, baking the air thick with the scent of honeysuckle and exhaust fumes. A lone tumbleweed skittered across the dusty road, pushed by a gust of wind that rustled the faded welcome banner strung across the main intersection: "Welcome to Harmony Springs - Where Life is Sweet."  

Harmony Springs wasn't exactly known for its sweetness these days. The peach orchards were struggling, the general store had closed down last month, and the town's only bank was rumored to be facing foreclosure. All of which meant a tough time for Amelia Rose Harper, insurance agent extraordinaire (at least in her own mind). 

Amelia sat slumped at her desk in the cramped office she shared with a psychic medium named Esmeralda who charged an extra fee for "communicating with your deceased pets."  The air conditioning wheezed out lukewarm air, struggling against the oppressive heat. Amelia swiped at a bead of sweat trickling down her temple and sighed. This was going to be a long day.
