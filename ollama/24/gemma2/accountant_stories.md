The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Thornton's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees.  Their sterile buzz punctuated the rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard as she wrestled with another quarterly report for Hemlock Industries. The air in the office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar cocktail at this time of year. 

Amelia sat hunched over her desk, her glasses perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, her dark hair falling into her face like a curtain.  The world beyond her cubicle walls seemed to be fading away, replaced by a symphony of numbers and spreadsheets. Hemlock Industries, with its labyrinthine accounts and questionable practices, had become her sole reality. 


She was an expert in deciphering their financial chaos, finding patterns where others saw only randomness. But lately, something felt different. A nagging unease, like a rogue decimal point throwing everything off balance. The numbers whispered secrets, cryptic clues hidden within the mundane.  And Amelia, despite her methodical nature, couldn't shake the feeling that she was on the verge of uncovering something big, something potentially dangerous.
