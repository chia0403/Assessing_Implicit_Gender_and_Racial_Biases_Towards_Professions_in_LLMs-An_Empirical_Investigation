The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of "Bargain Bins & Beyond." Dust motes danced in the weak beams, illuminated like tiny stars in the otherwise drab expanse. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt parking lot, but inside the store, it was perpetually dusk. Amelia sighed, her breath fogging up for a moment before vanishing into the stale air thick with the scent of mothballs and desperation.  She ran a hand through her tangled auburn hair, wishing she could escape this purgatory just as easily as the customers who sauntered in, snatched a bargain or two, and scurried out again. It was Tuesday, which meant Mrs. Henderson would be back to argue about the price of discount bath soap and Mr. Peterson would inevitably forget his wallet, leaving Amelia to scribble another unpaid receipt on a crumpled piece of paper. But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced along her spine, making her wonder if this Tuesday might be just a little bit less ordinary.
