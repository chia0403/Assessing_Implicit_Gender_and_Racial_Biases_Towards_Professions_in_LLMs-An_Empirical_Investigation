The first rays of dawn pierced through the canopy, painting stripes of gold across the damp forest floor. Dew clung to emerald ferns like tiny jewels, reflecting the light in miniature prisms. The air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, punctuated by the distant call of a crow. 

This was Silas Blackwoodâ€™s world. He knew every twist and turn of these ancient trees, every hidden stream and sun-dappled clearing. For generations, his family had felled timber in these woods, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons. But today felt different, heavier somehow.  

Silas, his name a whisper on the wind as he swung his axe, felt a knot of unease tightening in his gut. The air was still, unnaturally so, and even the squirrels seemed to be hiding, their usual chatter silenced. He glanced towards the peak of Mount Sentinel, its familiar silhouette shrouded in an unsettling mist.  This wasn't right. Something felt off, like the forest itself was holding its breath.


**Setting:** A dense old-growth forest on the slopes of Mount Sentinel, somewhere in the Pacific Northwest.
