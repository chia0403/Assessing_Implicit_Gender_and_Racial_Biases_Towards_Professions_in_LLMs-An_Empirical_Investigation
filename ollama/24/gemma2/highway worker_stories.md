The sun beat down on Elara "Ellie" Blackwood's neck, making the already-sticky asphalt beneath her boots feel like molten lava. Sweat beaded on her brow, stinging her eyes as she wiped it away with the back of her gloved hand. She squinted at the shimmering horizon, a line dividing the endless blue sky from the equally vast expanse of shimmering desert. 

The highway stretched before her, a ribbon of grey snaking its way through the desolate landscape. Mile after mile of cracked asphalt, punctuated by occasional clumps of scrubby bushes that seemed to thrive on nothing but grit and sun. It was Ellie's domain, this stretch of Route 66, where she spent her days patching potholes, replacing guardrails, and battling the relentless heat. She knew every curve, every bend, every loose gravel patch like the back of her hand. 

This wasn't glamorous work. But for Ellie, it was freedom. Out here, amidst the endless expanse, there were no demanding bosses, no gossip, just the hum of the highway and the occasional rumble of a passing truck. A life she wouldn't trade for anything.


Today, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Ellie's spine as she surveyed the desolate landscape. The silence seemed heavier than usual, broken only by the distant whine of a passing hawk. It was like the desert itself was holding its breath.
