The air hung thick with the scent of brine and rot as Gareth Blackwood adjusted his helmet, the worn leather creaking against his calloused hands. A sliver of the setting sun cast an orange glow on the dilapidated stone walls of Port Morwen, its reflection dancing in the murky water of the harbor. Rusty ships groaned against their moorings, their sails tattered like old wounds, and a chorus of gulls screeched overhead, their cries mingling with the distant clang of the blacksmith's hammer. 

Gareth, the youngest guard on duty tonight, scanned the bustling dockyard with weary eyes. Every shadow seemed to hold a potential threat: smugglers with illicit cargo, desperate souls fleeing the city’s troubles, or worse – pirates who saw Port Morwen as an easy target. His father, the Captain of the Guard, had drilled into him the importance of vigilance. "A guard's life is one of constant watch," he'd say, his voice gruff but laced with a hint of tenderness. "You are the shield that protects this city." 

Tonight, Gareth felt more like a flimsy piece of parchment than a shield, the weight of responsibility pressing down on him like the approaching storm clouds. He tightened his grip on his sword hilt, its worn pommel offering a sliver of comfort in the gathering gloom. His father would be proud, he thought, even if it was just for trying.
