Receipts overflowed from overflowing file folders, each one a testament to the chaotic financial lives she navigated with laser focus.  She wasn't just an income tax preparer; she was a financial archaeologist, digging through years of transactions to unearth buried deductions and claim every penny legally due.

Outside, a relentless spring rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the internal storm brewing in Clara's mind.
