The aroma of stale coffee hung heavy in Dr. Amelia Katherine Hayes' tiny office. Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windowpanes, cast dusty stripes across her well-worn armchair and the scattered stacks of psychology journals that seemed to multiply overnight. Outside, the familiar din of rush hour traffic hummed its symphony – a constant reminder of the chaos Amelia navigated daily, both within her patients' minds and in her own.

Amelia sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. Her latest patient, a young man named Ethan with a haunted look and mumbled confessions, had left an unsettling residue in the air. His story – fragmented, riddled with anxieties about an impending apocalypse he felt coming on like a storm –  had burrowed into Amelia's subconscious. She couldn't shake the feeling that his fears weren't merely delusions; there was a palpable undercurrent of truth to his words, something unsettlingly real beneath the surface of his paranoia.

Amelia glanced at the clock: 5:47 PM. Another day closer to the end of the week, and another day further from finding peace herself.  She pushed back her chair, intending to brew another cup of coffee, when a persistent buzzing sound jolted her attention. It wasn't the usual drone of city noise; this was sharper, more insistent. A tremor ran through the floor beneath her feet, and the air grew thick with an unnatural stillness. 


  The hum intensified, vibrating the very walls of her office. Amelia’s pulse quickened. Whatever was happening outside, it felt like the beginning of something… different.
