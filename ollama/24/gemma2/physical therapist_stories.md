The air in the small clinic hung thick with the scent of eucalyptus oil and antiseptic. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air like tiny stars.  Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Hayes adjusted her stethoscope, listening to the rasping breaths emanating from the figure lying on the examination table. 

It was Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter with gnarled hands and a stubborn streak wider than the redwood planks he used to work with. His right leg, ravaged by arthritis, had betrayed him during a particularly enthusiastic gardening session last week. Now, Ellie's job was to help coax it back to life, though the prospect seemed as daunting as scaling Mount Whitney in flip-flops. 

"Alright, Mr. Henderson," Ellie said, her voice gentle yet firm. "Let's see what we can do about this stubborn old leg of yours."


This opening takes place in a small, quaint physical therapy clinic on a sunny afternoon.
