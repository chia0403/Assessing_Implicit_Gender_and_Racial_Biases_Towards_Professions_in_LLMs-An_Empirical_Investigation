The flickering neon sign outside the "Grandview Hotel" cast an oily sheen across Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's polished shoes. He adjusted his starched cap, the brass buttons glinting in the sickly light, and surveyed the deserted street. Rain lashed down, drumming on the awning above him like a thousand tiny hammers. A biting wind whipped through the gaps in the building’s facade, sending shivers down Bart’s spine despite the thick wool of his uniform.  

The Grandview was a relic of a bygone era – opulent yet faded, its grandeur clinging desperately to the peeling paint and threadbare carpets. It had seen better days, just like most things in this forgotten corner of New Orleans. 


Bart, though born and raised in the heart of the French Quarter, felt more at home amongst the ghosts of the Grandview than he did amongst the bustling crowds and cacophony of his own neighborhood. He preferred the hushed whispers of history that clung to the hallways, the scent of mothballs and forgotten dreams that permeated the air.
