The air crackled with static electricity, carrying the scent of ozone and fear. Rain lashed against Lieutenant Anya Petrova's helmet, blurring the flames that devoured the old apartment building across the street.  Sirens wailed, their mournful cries swallowed by the roar of the inferno. The wind whipped at Anya's coat, tugging it taut against her body as she watched the smoke billow skyward, an angry, black dragon devouring the night. This wasn't just another fire; this one felt different, heavier. A gnawing sense of foreboding settled in Anya's gut, a feeling that whispered of danger lurking beneath the surface of this raging inferno. 


The setting:

A bustling city on the edge of a hurricane season. The old apartment building is situated in a run-down neighborhood, known for its narrow streets and aging infrastructure. The sky above is bruised with thunderclouds, casting an eerie glow over the chaotic scene as the rain pours down relentlessly.
