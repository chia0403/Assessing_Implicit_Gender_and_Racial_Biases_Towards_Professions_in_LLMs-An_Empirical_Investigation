The scent of lilies choked Amelia Rose Hawthorne, not in the pleasant way that normally filled her little shop. It was the cloying, overripe aroma of despair. A bouquet of white lilies, their petals browning at the edges, sat wilted on the counter beside a crumpled note: "For Mrs. Gable. Please say I'm sorry." 

Amelia sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her messy bun.  Her shop, "Blooming Marigolds," nestled between a bustling bakery and a vintage bookstore in the heart of Willow Creek, was usually alive with vibrant colours and the chatter of customers. But today, the air hung heavy with the weight of sorrow. Mrs. Gable's husband had passed away just that morning, leaving behind a gaping hole in the community and an echoing silence where laughter once filled their little corner cafe.  

Willow Creek, a town steeped in old-fashioned charm and wrapped in a blanket of autumn hues, was known for its tight-knit community and vibrant flower festivals. But even the most beautiful blooms couldn't always mask the harsh realities of life. 


Amelia took a deep breath, the scent of lilies momentarily forgotten as she inhaled the earthy fragrance of her prized roses blooming by the window.  She had to find a way to bring light back into this gloomy day, both for Mrs. Gable and for herself. After all, even in death, there was always beauty to be found.
