The diesel engine hummed a steady, reassuring song beneath Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood's calloused fingers. She gripped the steering wheel of her Peterbilt 379, affectionately nicknamed 'Betsy', as she navigated the deserted stretch of Highway 80 through Nevada. The sun was beginning its descent, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple.  Cacti stood sentinel along the roadside, their spiny arms reaching towards the fading light like skeletal fingers. A hawk circled overhead, its piercing cry echoing in the vast silence. Ellieâ€™s face, weathered and lined by years spent under the unforgiving sun, held a quiet satisfaction as she surveyed the landscape. She was home on the open road, where the only company she needed was the rhythm of the engine, the wind whistling through the gaps in her windshield, and the occasional chat with another lonely soul on CB radio. 


This desolate beauty, this tangible solitude, was Ellie's solace. It was a far cry from the suffocating noise and chaos of her hometown, where memories clung to her like dust motes in the sunbeams. Here, under the boundless Nevada sky, she could be whoever she wanted to be:  a lone wolf, a nomad, a guardian of the asphalt arteries that crisscrossed America. She was free.
