The bell above the door tinkled its welcome as Amelia Rose Thornton adjusted the embroidered pillow on her waiting room couch. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the familiar cityscape into impressionistic strokes of grey and neon. 

Amelia glanced at her clock: 3:57 pm. Just in time for Dr. Singh's appointment. She hoped the storm wouldn't deter him; he'd been complaining about a stiff neck that was hindering his practice as a concert pianist.  The rhythmic tapping of raindrops and the gentle hum of the waiting room's diffuser, filling the air with lavender and rosemary, provided a comforting counterpoint to the city's restless energy outside. 

Amelia Rose Thornton, her name a tapestry woven from family tradition and personal aspiration, believed in healing the body and calming the soul. Her small practice nestled on the bustling corner of Elm Street and 5th Avenue was more than just a place to alleviate aches and pains; it was a sanctuary where worries could be released with every spinal adjustment, leaving behind a sense of lightness and well-being.
