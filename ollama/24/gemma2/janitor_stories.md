The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony above Elias Finch's head as he mopped the linoleum floors of the City Library's reference section. Dust motes danced in the pale beams, illuminated against the backdrop of towering shelves crammed with ancient tomes and forgotten encyclopedias. It was 2:37 AM, the witching hour for custodians, a time when the library fell silent save for the rhythmic swish of Elias' mop and the occasional rustle of wind through the cracked windowpanes. He inhaled deeply, savoring the scent of aged paper and faintly musty leather - a fragrance that had become as familiar to him as his own heartbeat.  

Elias preferred these solitary hours. The hushed stillness provided a stark contrast to the chaotic symphony of human interaction during the day. Here, amongst the silent guardians of knowledge, he felt a strange sense of peace, a connection to something larger than himself.
