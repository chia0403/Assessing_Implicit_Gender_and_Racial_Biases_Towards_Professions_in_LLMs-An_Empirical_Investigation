The sun, a molten fist punching through the smog-choked sky, beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's neck. Sweat plastered his faded bandanna to his forehead, making it difficult to see the seam he was working on. Below him, Mrs. Rodriguez's backyard resembled an oasis of green amidst the urban desert - a patch of vibrant life in a city that felt increasingly choked by concrete and despair.

It was the thought of a faulty hook sending him plummeting to the cracked asphalt below that gave him the chills.  This job, replacing the aging shingles on Mrs. Rodriguez's modest bungalow, was simple enough. But even routine jobs in this city could turn deadly if you weren't careful.
