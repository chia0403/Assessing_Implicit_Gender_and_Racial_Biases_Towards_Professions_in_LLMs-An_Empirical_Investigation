The air in Apothecary Aisling's shop smelled faintly of lavender and old paper, a comforting aroma that usually soothed her anxieties. But today, even the familiar scent couldnâ€™t quite mask the prickling unease crawling up Aisling Maeve O'Malley's spine. The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windowpanes, casting long shadows across the shelves crammed with jars of dried herbs, vials of shimmering potions, and leather-bound books filled with arcane recipes.  

Aisling was alone in the shop, as she often was on Thursdays, when the rest of the town bustled at the weekly market. She preferred the quiet solitude, a chance to organize the chaotic jumble of her mind, to sift through the anxieties that threatened to overwhelm her like encroaching fog. But today, the silence felt oppressive, heavy with a sense of impending doom. 


The old bell above the shop door jingled, shattering Aisling's thoughts.  Her hand instinctively went to the silver locket hanging around her neck, a comforting weight against her chest. Her gaze flickered to the door as a figure stepped into the warm glow of the apothecary.
