Today's task: carve a new road through this unforgiving landscape, connecting a fledgling solar farm to the power grid. It wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest. And for Elara, there was no place sheâ€™d rather be than behind the controls of her trusty machine, feeling the earth tremble beneath its iron grip.
