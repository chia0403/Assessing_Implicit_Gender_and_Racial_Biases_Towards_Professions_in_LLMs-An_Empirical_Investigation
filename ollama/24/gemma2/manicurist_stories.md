The scent of lavender and almond hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Rosepetal's cotton apron like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon sunlight that streamed through the windowpanes of "Polish & Prose," her little nail salon tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in Prague. Outside, the city hummed with the rhythm of life â€“ vendors hawking trinkets, trams clattering past, laughter spilling from open doorways. Inside, however, Amelia's world was one of meticulous silence and precise movements.  

She leaned over her client, Mrs. Dvorakova, a retired opera singer whose hands were as elegant as they were wrinkled. With practiced ease, Amelia filed and shaped the brittle nails, a gentle murmur escaping her lips as she worked. "You know, Mrs. Dvorakova," Amelia said, tilting her head to examine the faded pink polish on the nails, "This shade suits you beautifully. It reminds me of the cherry blossoms in springtime."

Mrs. Dvorakova chuckled, her eyes crinkling at the corners. "Amelia, dear, you have a way with words, just like your namesake.  The rose petals are always whispering their secrets to you, aren't they?" 


Amelia smiled, her own reflection flickering in the chrome surface of the nail dryer. "Perhaps, Mrs. Dvorakova. Perhaps." Little did she know, those whispers were about to become a whole lot louder.
