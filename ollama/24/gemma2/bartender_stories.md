The low hum of conversation buzzed around Evelyn "Evie" Blackwood like a swarm of contented bees. The air was thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, cheap perfume, and something she vaguely identified as desperation. The dim lights of "The Rusty Mug," cast long shadows across the mahogany bar, highlighting the worn grooves carved by countless thirsty hands over decades. Evie, perched on a stool behind the counter, swirled a cocktail glass, her reflection shimmering momentarily in the amber liquid. It was just another Tuesday night at The Rusty Mug â€“ a symphony of clinking glasses, whispered secrets, and the occasional drunken brawl.  


Tonight, though, something felt different.
