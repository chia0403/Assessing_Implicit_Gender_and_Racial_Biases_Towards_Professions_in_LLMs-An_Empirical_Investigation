The chill of dawn had yet to penetrate the thick brick walls of "Carter's Cuts," its warmth held captive by the sizzling fat rendering from yesterday's pork bellies.  

Elroy Carter, his apron smeared with crimson and bone marrow, hummed along to the scratchy blues tune emanating from the crackling radio perched on a shelf above the meat slicer. He was already knee-deep in the day's grind, meticulously trimming slabs of beef brisket and expertly filleting trout that shimmered silver under the harsh fluorescent lights.

Elroy had inherited "Carter's Cuts" from his father twenty years ago, inheriting not only the shop but also a legacy steeped in tradition, gossip, and the peculiar scent of freshly butchered meat that clung to everything like a comforting second skin. He knew every customer by name, their orders memorized, their lives chronicled in hushed whispers between cleaver strokes.

The bell above the door tinkled, announcing the arrival of a stranger whose pale blue eyes held a disconcerting intensity that sent a shiver down Elroy's spine.
