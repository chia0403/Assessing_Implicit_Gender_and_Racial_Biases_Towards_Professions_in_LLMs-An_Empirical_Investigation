The crisp autumn air clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick’s woolen cap as he surveyed his domain.  Sunlight filtered through the towering oaks lining the manicured pathways of Oakhaven Manor, casting dappled shadows across the fallen leaves. A gentle breeze rustled through the hedges, carrying the scent of decaying foliage and woodsmoke from the manor's chimneys.

Bartholomew, with his calloused hands weathered by years of tending the grounds, felt a familiar sense of peace settle over him. He loved this place, Oakhaven Manor, even with its faded grandeur and air of melancholy.  He knew every inch of its sprawling gardens – from the vibrant rose bushes bordering the cobblestone paths to the ancient willow tree whispering secrets by the pond. 

But lately, Bartholomew had noticed a change. A prickling unease that settled in his bones whenever he worked after sunset. Shadows seemed deeper, whispers more insistent. The silence was no longer peaceful but heavy with an unspoken dread.


Today, however, Bartholomew would focus on routine. He straightened his spectacles and set to work raking the fallen leaves, determined to keep the grounds as beautiful as they always had been, even if something unsettling lurked beneath the surface.
