The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's head, casting a sterile white glow over the meticulously organized dental instruments. Outside her window, the quaint seaside town of Oakhaven was waking up, the smell of salt and brewing coffee drifting through the cracked pane. But inside "Ainsworth Smiles," the morning was quiet, punctuated only by the rhythmic click of Dr. Ainsworth's pen as she filled out patient charts. 

She took a sip of lukewarm coffee, grimacing at its bitter taste. Her day always began this way â€“ solitude and spreadsheets, followed by the symphony of drills, suction, and anxious murmurs that filled her practice from late morning onwards.  Dr. Ainsworth prided herself on being efficient, a master orchestrator of dental appointments, but lately, the usual rhythm had felt off-kilter, like a discordant note in an otherwise well-rehearsed melody.
