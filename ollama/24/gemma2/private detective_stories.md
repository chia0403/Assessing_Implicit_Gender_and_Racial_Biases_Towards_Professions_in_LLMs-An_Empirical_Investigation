Rain lashed against the cracked windowpane of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office, each drop a miniature hammer blow against the already tired glass. The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, mingling with the dampness seeping through the building's porous walls.  The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting Bart's face in a series of harsh, dancing shadows. "Quill Investigations: No Case Too Small, No Client Too Troubled," it proclaimed, a boast that felt increasingly hollow with each passing month. 

Bart, a man whose sharp features seemed perpetually etched with the weight of unsolved mysteries, stared out at the rain-soaked street. His trench coat hung limply on his thin frame, mirroring the drooping morale of his clientele. He hadn't had a decent case in weeks, just a string of missing cat reports and petty theft complaints that barely covered his rent. The clock ticked past midnight, each tick another reminder of his dwindling hope. Then, the door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and a figure shrouded in darkness. 


"Mr. Quill?" a voice rasped from the gloom.  "I have a case for you."
