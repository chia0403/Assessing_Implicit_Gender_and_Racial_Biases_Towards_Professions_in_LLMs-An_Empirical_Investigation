The fluorescent lights hummed above Eliza Beatrice Finch's head like an anxious hive of bees, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the worn reception desk. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a potent cocktail that permeated the dingy office building on 42nd Street. Outside, the city roared in its usual symphony of honking horns and screeching tires, but inside, silence reigned except for the occasional clatter of keys or the muffled sobs from cubicle 17B. Eliza sighed, her reflection staring back at her from the polished surface of the desk, a weary-eyed woman trapped in a beige office purgatory. Her smile felt brittle as she greeted Mr. Henderson, his tie askew and his face contorted with an unfamiliar panic, "Good morning, sir. What can I do for you?" 


He didn't even respond, just thrust a crumpled envelope across the desk and stammered something about needing to speak with Ms. Davies immediately.  Elizaâ€™s eyebrows rose. This wasn't like Mr. Henderson at all. He was usually as predictable as clockwork, arriving precisely at 8:30 am for his daily dose of lukewarm coffee and gossip with Mrs. Patel from accounting. Today, however, he seemed different, a stranger hiding behind familiar features. As she peeled open the envelope, her heart began to race. It wasn't a routine expense report. The contents were far more sinister.
