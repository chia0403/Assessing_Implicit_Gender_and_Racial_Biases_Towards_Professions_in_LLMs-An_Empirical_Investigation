The air crackled with static as Lieutenant Commander Evelyn "Ev" Thorne gripped the controls of her F-22 Raptor.  Beneath her, the swirling storm clouds over the Atlantic were a menacing tapestry of grey and black. Lightning flashed, illuminating for fleeting moments the jagged peaks of the Azores archipelago rising from the churning sea like ancient, slumbering dragons. Ev's visor reflected the chaos outside - the tempest mirrored the turmoil in her own mind. 

It was a routine training exercise, meant to test their mettle against simulated enemy threats and unpredictable weather. But for Ev, this mission felt different, charged with an undercurrent of dread she couldn't shake. It had been six months since the disappearance of her squadron leader, Captain Liam Hayes, during a covert operation in North Africa. The official explanation was a navigational error followed by catastrophic engine failure, but Ev knew better. 

The ghosts of what might have happened that day lingered, whispering doubts and fears. This mission, this storm, felt like a call to answer those whispers, a chance to finally confront the truth, even if it meant risking everything she held dear.
