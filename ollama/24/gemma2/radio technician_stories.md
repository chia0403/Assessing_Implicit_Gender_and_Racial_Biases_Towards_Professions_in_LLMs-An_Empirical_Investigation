The static crackled through Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's headphones, a familiar white noise symphony accompanying her meticulous work.  She sat hunched over her workbench in the cramped confines of Radio Shack 347, nestled in the heart of the bustling Port Arthur docks. The air was thick with the scent of salt, engine oil, and fried fish from the nearby food stalls. Around her, radios of all shapes and sizes lay disassembled, their innards exposed like open wounds. Each one held a story, a journey captured in its tangled wires and faded dials. Amy knew them all, these silent voices yearning to be heard again.  Outside, the mournful wail of foghorns echoed across the choppy harbor as dusk settled, casting long shadows across the grimy windows. 


A sudden thump at the door startled her from her concentration. A gruff voice called out, "Amy? You in there?" It was Captain Finnigan, his weathered face framed by a tangle of salt-and-pepper hair, his eyes searching hers with a mixture of desperation and hope. He held a battered radio in his hand, its antenna drooping like a broken wing. 


"What's wrong, Cap?" Amy asked, her voice calm and steady despite the knot of anticipation tightening in her stomach.  This wasn't just any repair. This was about more than just getting a message through.
