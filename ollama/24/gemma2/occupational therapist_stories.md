The rhythmic slap of rain against the corrugated metal roof was the soundtrack to Amelia Everly's morning. Rain in this part of rural Montana meant everything slowed down â€“ the cows huddled closer under the barn eaves, the wind whipped through the tallgrass with a mournful sigh, and even the normally boisterous crows seemed subdued. 

Amelia, her bright yellow raincoat a beacon against the grey sky, maneuvered her beat-up Jeep down the rutted dirt road towards Meadow Creek Home Health. As an occupational therapist, her job was to help people regain their independence after injuries or illnesses, often in isolated corners of the state like this.  Today, she was meeting with Mrs. Evelyn Thornton, a woman in her late seventies who'd recently suffered a stroke. Amelia hoped to get Mrs. Thornton back to enjoying her garden - her passion before the stroke had stolen her mobility. But judging by the downpour and the thick mud clinging to her tires, Amelia suspected it might be another day of cancelled appointments, frustrating delays, and the heavy silence of rain-soaked afternoons.
