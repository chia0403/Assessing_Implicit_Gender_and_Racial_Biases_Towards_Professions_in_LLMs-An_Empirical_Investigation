The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Sprocket Diner like a thousand tiny fists, drowning out the tinny country music bleeding from the speakers.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne hunched over a lukewarm cup of coffee, the steam doing little to warm her chilled fingers. The diner was nearly empty, save for a trucker slumped at the counter, nursing a bottomless mug of black coffee, and a pair of local ranchers arguing in hushed tones about the price of cattle. 

Amy, with her tangled auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, felt every bit as out of place as the lone dandelion sprouting through a crack in the diner's dusty floor. She was a city girl through and through – used to slick sidewalks, towering skyscrapers, and the constant hum of traffic.  But here, in the heart of Dustbowl County, Wyoming, she was just another face lost in a sea of weathered faces and worn leather jackets. 

She hadn't come here for the ambience. She’d come for the story. A story about a missing rancher, a string of unsettling rumors, and whispers of something dark lurking in the shadow of the Windswept Mountains.  Something that had made even the hardened ranchers speak in hushed tones. Something Amy was determined to uncover, regardless of the risks.
