The acrid tang of graphite hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of stale coffee and sweat.  Eleanor "Ellie" Blythe squinted at the blueprints spread across her workbench, their lines blurred by the harsh fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. A thin layer of dust coated everything, a testament to the relentless work that filled the drafting room of the Atlas Steel Corporation day in and day out. 

The clock on the wall ticked away relentlessly, each second marking another minute closer to quitting time. Ellie shifted her weight, wincing as the dull ache in her lower back flared. She'd been hunched over these plans for hours, trying to decipher the tangled mess of lines that represented their latest project: a colossal crane for the burgeoning port city across the bay.  

Outside, the cityscape stretched out, a maze of steel and glass shimmering under the fading afternoon sun. Ellie could almost hear the clatter of construction in the distance, a constant reminder of the ever-expanding world they were helping to build. But here, within the confines of the drafting room, it felt like time stood still, measured only by the scratch of pencils and the rhythmic hum of machinery.
