The grease clung to Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Cartwright's hands like a second skin. It wasn't just the grime; it was a badge of honor, a testament to her years spent wrestling with engines under the fluorescent hum of The Garage, nestled deep in the heart of Rust Valley, Montana.  

Rust Valley lived up to its name. A once-thriving mining town, it had withered and rusted like an abandoned car left out in the elements. Now, it was populated mostly by folks who clung to the land like barnacles to a hull, their lives dictated by the whims of the wind and the creaking bones of the past.  

Amy's garage, passed down from her grandfather, was one of the few beacons of life left in Rust Valley. It smelled of motor oil, gasoline, and hope - a potent cocktail that attracted more than just broken-down cars.
