The air hung thick with the scent of yeast and caramelized sugar, a sweet symphony only broken by the rhythmic thud of Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s rolling pin against her flour-dusted countertop. Outside, the Parisian morning was just waking up, the golden light filtering through the dusty windows of her quaint bakery, “Le Petit Four.”  

Amelia, with her auburn hair pulled back in a neat braid and a smudge of cocoa powder on her cheek, kneaded a fresh batch of brioche with practiced ease. Her movements were deliberate, almost meditative, as she transformed the simple ingredients into something magical – fluffy, golden mounds of buttery goodness that would soon be piled high with delicate pastries and whipped cream.  

But today, amidst the familiar comforting chaos, Amelia felt a prickle of unease. A flyer, pinned to the community board outside her shop, announced a new bakery opening just down the street, boasting “the most exquisite croissants in Paris.” Amelia knew competition was fierce in this city, and a flicker of doubt sparked within her – could she keep up with this newcomer?
