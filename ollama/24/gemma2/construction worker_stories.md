The air hung thick with the smell of sweat, diesel, and concrete dust. It was the kind of August heat that clung to you like a second skin, making each breath feel like inhaling furnace smoke.  Sweat beaded on Elias Thorne's brow, trickling down his temple and stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a stubborn steel beam. 

He grunted, his muscles screaming in protest. He wasn't a young man anymore – forty-two going on sixty, at least that's what his knees felt like. But the foreman had promised overtime if they finished framing this section of the new bridge by nightfall, and Elias needed the extra cash to fix his daughter’s busted car before college started.

He glanced over at the sprawling cityscape unfolding around them. Chicago, a concrete jungle pulsating with life even in the late afternoon haze. The steel skeleton of the bridge jutted out like an unfinished sentence, reaching towards the glistening lakefront where sailboats bobbed lazily on the water. Elias knew this city like the back of his hand – every crack in the sidewalk, every dive bar off the beaten path, every hidden park where kids dared to dream under the shade of towering oaks. It was his city, and for all its grit and grime, it held a certain beauty that he couldn't deny.
