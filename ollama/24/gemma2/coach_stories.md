The humid Florida air clung to Coach Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne like a second skin as she surveyed her team. The late afternoon sun beat down on the dusty baseball field, turning the already sweltering July day into an oven. Palm trees swayed lazily in the breeze, their fronds casting dappled shadows across the infield dirt.  

A group of twelve-year-olds sprawled under the shade of the dugout, sweat staining their jerseys and faces contorted in varying degrees of boredom. Amy sighed, her gaze drifting to the worn scoreboard, its numbers stark against the weathered wood: 1 run for their opponent, 0 for them. This wasn't how she envisioned this season going. She had high hopes for these kids, a team brimming with potential that felt stifled by nerves and self-doubt.  Amy knew they were capable of greatness, but she needed to figure out how to unlock it before the season slipped away from them entirely.
