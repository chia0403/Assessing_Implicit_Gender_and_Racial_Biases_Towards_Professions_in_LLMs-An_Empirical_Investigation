Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Harper's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her own head.  The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, competing with the aroma of old books from the overflowing bookshelf lining one wall. A worn armchair sat opposite her desk, waiting for another child to spill their secrets into its plush depths. 

Amelia stared at the rain-streaked window, her reflection momentarily superimposed over the blurry cityscape outside. She was tired, bone-deep weary from navigating the emotional minefield that was Willow Creek Elementary. Today's caseload felt particularly heavy, a symphony of anxieties playing out in her mind: a first grader with crippling stage fright, a middle schooler battling whispers of self-harm, and a high school senior teetering on the edge of academic collapse.  

Just then, the phone rang, shattering the silence. Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever new crisis awaited. 


**Setting:** Willow Creek Elementary School - A public elementary and middle school in a mid-sized American city experiencing economic decline. The building is aging but well-maintained, with classrooms that have seen better days and a perpetually cramped library.
