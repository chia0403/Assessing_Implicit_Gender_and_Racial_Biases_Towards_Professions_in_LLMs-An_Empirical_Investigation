The humid Mississippi air hung thick in Jackson, clinging to Silas Blackwood like a damp shroud. Sweat beaded on his forehead, tracing paths through the grime that had become ingrained in his skin from years of wrestling with wires and circuits.  Silas squinted at the dilapidated Victorian mansion before him, its peeling paint and overgrown yard whispering tales of forgotten grandeur. He wasn't sure what to expect inside, but he knew one thing for certain: this wouldn't be another routine repair job. Mrs. Clementine Hayes, the mansion's sole inhabitant, had been strangely insistent on secrecy, demanding Silas come at dawn and promising a hefty sum "for discretion."  

He adjusted his tool belt, the weight of his hammer and pliers comforting in its familiarity. Taking a deep breath, Silas pushed open the creaking wrought iron gate and stepped into the maw of the unknown.  The rusted hinges shrieked their protest as he crossed the overgrown path, each step crunching on brittle leaves that whispered secrets to the wind. 


This was going to be interesting.
