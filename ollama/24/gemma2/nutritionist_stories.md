The aroma of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, a scent Amelia Harper found more common than she cared for in her line of work. She sighed, peering into the toaster where two charred squares lay smoldering. It was 7:15 am, and already the day was starting off like most – chaotic and riddled with irony.

Amelia, a certified nutritionist with a degree from Stanford and a pantry stocked with kale chips and quinoa flour, couldn't seem to master the art of simple breakfast preparation.  She lived in a tiny studio apartment above a bustling bakery in downtown Seattle, where the allure of fresh croissants constantly tested her willpower. Her kitchen was barely large enough for her stand mixer, let alone a decent attempt at sourdough baking. 

But today wasn't about Amelia’s culinary failings. Today was the day she met with Mr. Bartholomew "Bart" Henderson, her most challenging client yet – a man who believed kale smoothies were communist propaganda and swore by raw meat as a source of “pure energy.”  Amelia had a feeling this wouldn't be your average nutrition consultation. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the glass facade of the Seattle Central Library where Amelia was meeting Bart. He was a week late for their appointment, having sent a string of apologetic emails citing everything from "an attack by rogue squirrels" to "a mystical vision involving quinoa."  Amelia hoped this wouldn't be another case of her time being wasted on someone who wasn't actually interested in changing their unhealthy habits.
