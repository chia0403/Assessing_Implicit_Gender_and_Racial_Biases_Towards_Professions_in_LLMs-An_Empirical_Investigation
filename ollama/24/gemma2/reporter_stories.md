The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and printer ink, a scent Amelia "Amy" Rosewater had come to associate with truth, however gritty it might be.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the City Gazette's downtown office, blurring the neon signs advertising dubious motels and greasy spoons across the street. The city itself hummed with a restless energy, a symphony of sirens, honking horns, and distant laughter echoing from overcrowded bars. 

Amy hunched over her desk, the flickering fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across her face as she scribbled notes furiously in a battered notepad. Her phone buzzed incessantly, each vibration a potential lead, a whisper of another story waiting to be unearthed.  Tonight, though, nothing felt right. A knot of unease tightened in Amy's gut â€“ a feeling that this city held secrets darker than any headline could contain.
