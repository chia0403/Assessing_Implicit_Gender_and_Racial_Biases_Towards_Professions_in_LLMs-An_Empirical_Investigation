The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Josephine Rivers, casting a sterile, sickly yellow glow over the vinyl countertop and chipped linoleum floor. The waiting room of Dr. Hanson's clinic was as predictable as the sunrise: a symphony of coughs, sniffles, and rustling magazines punctuated by the occasional, panicked intake of breath. 

Amelia adjusted the sleeves of her navy scrub top, feeling the familiar weight of the tourniquet pouch against her hip. She had been drawing blood for five years now, a career path chosen more out of necessity than passion. It was steady work, predictable, and it didn't require a college degree – which, considering her disastrous foray into art school, was a blessing in disguise. 

Today, though, something felt different. A prickling unease crawled up Amelia's spine, whispering warnings she couldn't quite decipher. Maybe it was the lingering scent of disinfectant that felt heavier than usual, or perhaps the way the other patients seemed to be looking at her with an almost accusatory gaze. 

Whatever the cause, Amelia pushed down the unsettling feeling, reminding herself that a phlebotomist was just a blood drawer – nothing more. But as she glanced at the name on the first patient's chart – "Samuel Blackwood" – a chill ran down her spine, a cold premonition settling in her gut like a stone.
