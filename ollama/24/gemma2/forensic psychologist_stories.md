The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Eleanor Vance’s head, casting a sterile glow over the interrogation room.  A steel table sat in the center, its surface scarred with countless battles won and lost between suspect and interrogator. Through the one-way mirror, Eleanor observed Detective Miller grilling a young man whose face was crumpled with fear. He clutched at his hands, his knuckles white against the rough fabric of his prison jumpsuit.

Eleanor knew this scene well. It played out in her mind like a loop – the tense atmosphere, the clipped dialogue, the desperate pleas and hollow justifications. This wasn’t just another case for Eleanor Vance, Forensic Psychologist to the NYPD.  This was personal. 


The man in the room, Michael Hayes, was accused of a brutal crime, but something didn't sit right with Eleanor. The evidence was circumstantial, the witness testimony shaky, and Michael’s demeanor, though fearful, held an unnervingly calculated edge. Eleanor felt, deep down, that there was more to this story than met the eye. Perhaps even a truth buried beneath layers of fear and deceit that only she could uncover.
