The morning mist clung to Amelia Thistlewick's worn boots as she trudged across the dew-laden grass towards the lion enclosure. The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, punctuated by the distant bleating of sheep from the neighboring pasture.  A gentle breeze ruffled her chestnut hair, carrying with it the low rumble of a lion's yawn echoing through the crisp morning air. Amelia Thistlewick, head animal caretaker at Whispering Pines Wildlife Sanctuary, lived for these moments - the quiet solitude before the day's chaos began, the earthy smells, and the comforting symphony of animal sounds. She paused at the edge of the enclosure, her hand resting on the weathered wooden gate, a familiar ache settling in her chest. It was always harder this time of year,  with the fading summer light reminding her of Leo's absence. 


Whispering Pines, nestled deep in the heart of Oregon's Cascade Mountains, wasn't your typical sanctuary. The sprawling grounds housed a menagerie of rescued creatures – majestic lions and playful otters, skittish foxes and gentle deer – each with their own story etched into Amelia's heart. But Leo, the magnificent male lion she'd raised from a cub, held a special place in her soul. He had been taken by illness last spring, leaving a void that still throbbed within her.
