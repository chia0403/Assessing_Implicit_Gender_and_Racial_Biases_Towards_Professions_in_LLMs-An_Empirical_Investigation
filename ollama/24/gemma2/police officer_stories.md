The rain hammered on Sergeant Amelia "Amy" Thorne's patrol car like angry fists. Visibility was down to a few feet, turning the familiar streets of Oakhaven into a blurry, menacing maze. A low mist clung to the ground, swallowing the flickering streetlights and casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the wind.  

Amy shivered, pulling her collar tighter against the damp chill seeping through her uniform. The air hung heavy with the smell of wet asphalt and something else – an acrid tang that made her nose wrinkle. It was a scent she knew well: burnt rubber and ozone. A telltale sign of illegal street racing, the kind that often ended in crashes and chaos. 

She glanced at the flickering light on her dashboard – just past midnight. This wasn't the quiet Sunday night shift she'd hoped for.
