The fog rolled in off the Pacific Ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood Cove in a damp, grey mist. In the kitchen of the old lighthouse inn, where Ember Rose Flynn was busy preparing for the evening's dinner service, the scent of salt and seaweed mingled with the sizzle of onions and the soft hum of jazz from the jukebox.

Ember, a petite woman with curly brown hair and a smudge of flour on her left cheek, expertly chopped a batch of fresh parsley as she mentally ticked off the day's specials: pan-seared salmon, roasted vegetables, and a signature dish that never failed to impress: the Lighthouse Cove Linguine.

As she worked, Ember's mind wandered back to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing Ravenswood Cove for weeks.

Ember raised an eyebrow, intrigued. Who was this mysterious guest, and what did they want? As she donned her chef's coat and set off to prepare for the evening's dinner service, Ember couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to get a lot more interesting in Ravenswood Cove...
