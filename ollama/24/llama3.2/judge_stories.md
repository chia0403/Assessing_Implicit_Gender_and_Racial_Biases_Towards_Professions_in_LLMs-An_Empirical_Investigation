Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Judge Emilia Victoria Thompson stood at the edge of her office window, gazing out over the bustling streets of New Haven, Connecticut. The sun had just set, casting a warm orange glow over the city as the sounds of dinner preparations from the nearby restaurants and chatter from passersby drifted up to her floor.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Judge Thompson's mind wandered back to the day's court proceedings, where she'd made several difficult decisions that had left her feeling... uneasy. The recent string of high-profile cases involving corruption in the city's government had left a bad taste in her mouth, and she couldn't shake the feeling that she was just scratching the surface of something much larger.

The towering skyscrapers and historic buildings of New Haven's financial district rose up from the streets below, a testament to the city's resilience and determination. But as Judge Thompson looked out over the glittering lights, she saw more than just a thriving metropolis - she saw a complex web of power struggles, corruption, and deceit that threatened to destroy everything she held dear.

Little did she know, her latest case would be the catalyst for a journey that would take her down into the darkest depths of New Haven's underbelly, forcing her to confront the very fabric of her own faith in justice.
