Dr. Emily Adelaide Wellesley adjusted her glasses as she surveyed the bustling waiting room of her chiropractic practice, nestled in the heart of downtown Portland.

Emily's curiosity was piqued, and she made a mental note to investigate further as soon as she finished reviewing the day's appointments.

Little did Emily know, this seemingly routine case would soon lead her down a path of discovery that would challenge everything she thought she knew about health, wellness, and the human body...
