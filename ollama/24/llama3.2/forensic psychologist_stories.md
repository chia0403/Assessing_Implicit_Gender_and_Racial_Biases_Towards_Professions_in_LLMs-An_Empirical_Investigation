Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the misty lake, the water lapping gently against the shore as she gazed out at the darkness. It was a spot she knew all too well, one that had witnessed some of the most heinous crimes in her career as a forensic psychologist.

The small town of Ravenswood was bathed in an eerie twilight, the streetlights casting long shadows across the deserted streets. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay, a morbid reminder of the horrors that lurked within its borders.

Lexi's eyes scanned the horizon, her mind racing with theories about the latest case to hit her desk: a young woman named Sarah Jenkins, found brutally murdered in her own home just days ago. The police were stumped, unable to find any leads or motives that made sense.

As Lexi turned to leave, her gaze fell upon an old, weathered bench, its wooden slats worn smooth by years of use and neglect. It was a spot where she often came to clear her mind, to let the weight of her work settle heavy on her shoulders.

She took a deep breath, feeling the cool mist on her skin as she began to walk towards the bench. The silence was almost palpable, broken only by the occasional hoot of an owl or the distant rumble of thunder. It was moments like these that Lexi felt most alive, most connected to the darkness within herself.

And yet, even in this peaceful setting, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, that unseen eyes were trained on her from the shadows. She quickened her pace, her heart beating just a little bit faster as she reached the bench and sat down, losing herself in the silence of the night.
