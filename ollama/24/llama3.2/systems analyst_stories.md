Here's a possible story opening:

It was a chilly autumn evening in late October when systems analyst, Ethan Alexander Thompson III, sat hunched over his computer screen at the small café on the outskirts of downtown. The flickering fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow on the rows of keyboards and laptops scattered across the worn wooden tables.
