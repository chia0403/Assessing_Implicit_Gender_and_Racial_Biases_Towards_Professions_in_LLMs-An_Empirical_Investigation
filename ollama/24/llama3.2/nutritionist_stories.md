The smell of saltwater and freshly baked bread wafted through the air, enticing the residents to take a stroll along the beach.

The sound of seagulls outside and the gentle hum of the refrigerator created a soothing background noise as Emilia sat at her desk, surrounded by stacks of cookbooks, research papers, and jars of exotic spices.
