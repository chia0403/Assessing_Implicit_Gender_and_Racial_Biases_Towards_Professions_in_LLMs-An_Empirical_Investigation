The sun had just begun to set over the bustling city of New Eden, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and crowded streets. Amidst the chaos, Captain Elijah "Hawk" Hawkins stood on the rooftop of his apartment building, gazing out at the endless expanse of the city's aerial highway. As a pilot for the prestigious flight company, Aerius Aviation, Hawk had spent countless hours soaring through the skies above New Eden, but tonight he was taking a rare moment to himself.

Hawk took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill his lungs as he looked out over the glittering lights of the city.

With a sense of excitement and trepidation, Hawk made his way back inside, ready to face whatever lay ahead and see if he could uncover the truth behind the mysterious cargo.
