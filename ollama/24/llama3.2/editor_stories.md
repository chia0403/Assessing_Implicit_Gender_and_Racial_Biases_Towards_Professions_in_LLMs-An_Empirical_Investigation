Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain poured down on the small town of Willow Creek like a relentless curtain of grey, shrouding its quaint streets and old brick buildings in a damp, misty veil. Inside the worn stone walls of Oakwood Books, the local used bookstore, Emily Elizabeth Wilson sorted through stacks of dog-eared paperbacks and dusty vinyl records with the detached precision of someone who'd spent her life surrounded by words.

Emily's eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed to hold a world of weariness, narrowed as she read over a review of the latest bestseller on her phone. A literary critic from the city had given it a scathing one-star review, and Emily couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment for the author - and for herself, who'd poured her own heart and soul into that very same manuscript. She sighed and closed her eyes, the soft whisper of rain outside blending with the hum of the old building's heating system as she let out a small sigh.

The words on the phone screen blurred together as Emily's thoughts wandered back to the long day ahead - a meeting with the local literary group, followed by a night of proofreading for a new client who'd paid top dollar for her expertise. But something was nagging at the edges of her mind, a quiet unease that refused to be pushed aside. It wasn't until she heard the creak of the old bookstore's door opening, and the soft murmur of footsteps on the worn wooden floorboards outside, that Emily felt it coalesce into a single, shivering thought: someone was coming for her.
