Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

The sun had just begun to set over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the intricately carved facades of the Treasury building and the narrow canyon known as the Siq. Tourist season was in full swing, with groups of chattering visitors streaming through the entrance every few minutes.

Among them was Amelia Rose Thompson, a seasoned tour guide with a passion for sharing the history and mythology of this ancient wonder of the world. With her dark hair tied back in a ponytail and a warm smile, Amelia led a group of wide-eyed tourists through the winding path of the Siq, pointing out hidden waterfalls and ancient carvings as they made their way towards the iconic Treasury.

As she led the group past the elaborate stone façade, Amelia couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and ownership. She had grown up in Petra, the daughter of a local guide who had taught her everything he knew about this incredible place. Over the years, she had honed her own skills as a tour guide, learning to weave together fact and fiction with ease.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Amelia had been approached by a mysterious client who wanted her to lead a private tour of Petra's hidden corners – the places that even the most seasoned guides rarely got to visit. The pay was astronomical, but Amelia had her doubts about this new venture. What secrets lay hidden in the shadows of this ancient city, and what would she uncover on this fateful night?
