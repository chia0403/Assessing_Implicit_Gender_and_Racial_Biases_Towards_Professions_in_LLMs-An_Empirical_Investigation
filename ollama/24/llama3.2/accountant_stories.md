Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the Pacific Ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Coveville in a damp, grey mist. It was the kind of morning that made you want to curl up with a cup of coffee and forget about the day ahead, but for Emily J. Wilson, CPA, it was just another day on the job.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee at her desk, staring out the foggy window of her accounting firm, Emily's mind began to wander back to the strange phone call she'd received the night before from an unknown number. The voice on the other end had been low and gravelly, with a hint of menace that made Emily's skin crawl.

"Meet me at the old lighthouse at midnight," the voice had said. "I have a job for you."

Emily's first instinct had been to hang up and forget about it, but something about the words had lingered in her mind, refusing to be dismissed. And now, as she gazed out into the swirling fog, she couldn't shake the feeling that this mysterious message was just the beginning of a much bigger, more complicated problem.

The accounting firm's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unforgiving glare over Emily's neat rows of papers and spreadsheets. She sighed inwardly, mentally preparing herself for another long day of number-crunching in the drizzly, grey world outside her window. Little did she know, that was only going to be the beginning.
