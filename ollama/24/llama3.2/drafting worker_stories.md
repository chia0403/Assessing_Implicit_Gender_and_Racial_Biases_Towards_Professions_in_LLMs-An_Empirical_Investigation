Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Haven gleamed like polished onyx as Emily Elizabeth Thompson stepped out of her small apartment, clutching a steaming cup of coffee in one hand and her worn leather satchel in the other. As she made her way down the creaky stairs to the street level, the faint scent of damp earth and exhaust fumes wafted up, mingling with the sweet aroma of freshly brewed coffee.

Emily took a deep breath, feeling the cool mist on her face, and gazed out at the grey skyscrapers looming above. It was going to be one of those days – the kind where the rain seemed to seep into every pore and make even the most mundane tasks feel like an uphill battle. But Emily was no stranger to drizzly afternoons; as a drafting worker for a small firm on 5th Street, she'd grown accustomed to the gloom.

As she walked towards her destination, the flickering fluorescent lights of the office building cast eerie shadows on the wet pavement, making it seem like the very streets themselves were shifting and twisting around her. Emily felt a shiver run down her spine, but it wasn't just the rain that was getting to her – it was something more. A feeling of unease, like there was something lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to pounce.

She quickened her pace, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalk as she approached the entrance to her office building. It was going to be a long day, and Emily was ready to tackle whatever challenges came her way – one drafting blueprint at a time.
