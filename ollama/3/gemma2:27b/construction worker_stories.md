Dust swirled around Thaddeus "Tad" O'Malley's worn boots as he surveyed the skeletal remains of what would one day be a gleaming skyscraper. The morning sun, already fierce despite its early hour, glinted off the steel beams jutting skyward like metallic bones. The air thrummed with the clang of hammers and the screech of metal against metal. It was a symphony Tad knew by heart, the soundtrack to his life for the past twenty years.  

He wiped sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand, squinting at the blueprints spread out on a rickety table beside him. Today's task: securing the final beam to the top floor, a precarious dance hundreds of feet above the bustling city streets. Tad felt a familiar thrill course through him, a mix of adrenaline and the quiet satisfaction that came from building something monumental out of nothing.
