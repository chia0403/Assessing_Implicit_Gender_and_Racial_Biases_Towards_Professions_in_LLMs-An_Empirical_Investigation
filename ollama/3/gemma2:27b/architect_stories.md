Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's cramped studio apartment, blurring the neon glow of the city outside into an impressionistic smear. The incessant drumming was driving him mad, each drop a tiny hammer chipping away at his already frayed nerves. Sketches lay scattered across his desk, abandoned mid-thought – jagged lines representing unfulfilled ambition, ghostly forms mocking his inability to translate vision into reality. Elias Thorne, once lauded as the rising star of the architectural world, now felt like a washed-up relic, adrift in a sea of concrete and broken dreams.  

The phone on his desk buzzed, jarring him from his despondency. He glanced at the caller ID – an unknown number. Hesitantly, Elias picked up the receiver. A voice, smooth and laced with urgency, filled the room. 


"Mr. Thorne? I believe you're the man I need."
