Rain lashed against the warped glass pane of Amelia Thistlewick's attic window, mimicking the frantic drum solo playing in her chest. She chewed on the end of her pen, its plastic casing already bearing teeth marks from her anxiety.  

Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh were slick with rain, reflecting the gaslights in a shimmering, distorted mirror image. Inside Amelia’s cramped attic room, tucked away behind a dusty chimney stack and overlooking the rooftops below, the air hung heavy with the scent of old paper, mildew, and desperation.

The story – a gothic romance set against the backdrop of Victorian Edinburgh – refused to coalesce into something coherent.  She’d envisioned it as a masterpiece, a haunting tale of forbidden love and dark secrets whispered in the shadows. Instead, it felt like a tangled mess of clichés and forced rhymes.
