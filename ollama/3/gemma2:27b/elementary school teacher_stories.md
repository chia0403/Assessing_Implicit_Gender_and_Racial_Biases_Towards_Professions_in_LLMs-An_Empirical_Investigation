The scent of burnt sugar and desperation hung heavy in the air of Ms. Eloise Beatrice Worthington’s third-grade classroom. It was 3:15 on a Wednesday afternoon, and the once vibrantly colored bulletin board proclaiming “Welcome to Wonder!” now sported wilted paper flowers and crooked construction paper stars, victims of an impromptu volcano eruption experiment gone awry. Ash from the baking soda and vinegar concoction coated everything, including Eloise's meticulously coiffed auburn hair, which she now frantically tried to smooth down with a damp tissue.

"Ms. Worthington," piped up Liam Henderson, his freckled face etched with concern, "Is it safe to breathe?" Eloise forced a smile, her heart thumping in her chest like a runaway hamster.


Setting: A cluttered and slightly chaotic third-grade classroom in a bustling elementary school located in a vibrant, multicultural neighbourhood.
