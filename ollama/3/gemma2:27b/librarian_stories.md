Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, each drop exploding in a miniature starburst on the ancient panes. Inside, Eleanor Penelope Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles and peered at the overflowing book cart with a sigh. The annual Spring Cleaning sale had been a roaring success, but now the library resembled a battlefield strewn with discarded tomes rather than a sanctuary of knowledge. 

Eleanor, with her silver braid wound tight like a cinnamon bun and eyes perpetually twinkling behind round spectacles, was the heart and soul of the Grand Blackwood. For fifty years, she'd navigated its labyrinthine stacks, whispered forgotten stories to wide-eyed children during story hour, and soothed frazzled students searching for that elusive research paper citation.  

But today, even Eleanor felt overwhelmed. The towering piles threatened to engulf her small desk, the air hung heavy with the scent of aging paper and dust, and a rogue gust of wind had sent a stack of dusty encyclopedias crashing onto the floor. As she bent to pick up the scattered volumes, a faint scratching sound drew her attention. It came from behind one of the oldest shelves, a mahogany behemoth laden with leather-bound first editions. Curiosity piqued, Eleanor cautiously approached, wondering if perhaps a mouse had taken refuge amongst the forgotten stories.
