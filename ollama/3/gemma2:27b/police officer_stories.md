Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Elias Blackwood's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. The city, normally a vibrant tapestry of sound and light, was muted tonight, shrouded in an oppressive grey that mirrored the mood swirling in Elias' gut.

He ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair, the faint scent of stale coffee clinging to it. Papers littered his desk, each one a grim reminder of the unsolved case that had been gnawing at him for weeks: the disappearance of Amelia Hayes, a young artist whose vibrant canvases seemed to mock the bleak reality of her vanishing.  

Elias stared out at the rain-soaked street below, its slick surface reflecting the garish red and blue lights of a patrol car cruising by. He longed for a break, for even a sliver of hope in this suffocating case. But tonight, all he felt was the heavy weight of responsibility pressing down on him, threatening to drown him in despair.
