The rhythmic clatter of Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's typewriter was the only sound in the hushed office, except for the occasional groan of the ancient radiator struggling against the February chill. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the already dreary cityscape beyond. Amelia sighed, her gaze drifting from the endless rows of ledgers before her to the clock ticking relentlessly on the wall. Five o'clock couldn't come soon enough.

She longed for the warmth of her tiny apartment, a steaming mug of chamomile tea, and the comforting scent of lavender filling the air. But tonight, even the prospect of quiet solitude couldn't entirely erase the gnawing anxiety in her chest. A letter had arrived that morning, stark white envelope embossed with an unfamiliar crest â€“ the crest of the Blackwood Estate, known for its reclusive inhabitants and whispers of dark secrets.

And Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick, a simple secretary who dreamt only of a peaceful life, found herself inexplicably summoned to the heart of it all.
