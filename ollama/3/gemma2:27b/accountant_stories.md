Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's office, blurring the already dismal view of the alleyway behind his building.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp concrete and something vaguely metallic, like old pennies left out in the rain. Bart himself smelled faintly of stale coffee and anxiety, a fragrance he'd come to associate with the end of the month.

He stared at the spreadsheet on his screen, rows upon rows of numbers mocking him with their relentless complexity.  Bart wasn't a bad accountant – in fact, he was quite meticulous – but this particular case had him stumped.  A string of seemingly unrelated transactions, all funneling through a shell corporation named "Zephyr Holdings," refused to make sense. 


**Setting:** A dimly lit, cramped accounting office in a rundown building in downtown Chicago.
