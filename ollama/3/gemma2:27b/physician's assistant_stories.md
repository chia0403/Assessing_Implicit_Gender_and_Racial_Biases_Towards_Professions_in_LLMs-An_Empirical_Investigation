The air in the makeshift triage tent hung thick with antiseptic and fear. Evelyn Rosewater, PA-C, her brow slick with sweat despite the chill October wind whipping through the gaps in the canvas walls, tried to ignore the tremor in her hands as she assessed the next patient. A young boy, maybe ten years old, lay whimpering on a cot, his face pale and drawn. His left leg was twisted at an unnatural angle, bone jutting out beneath torn jeans. Evelyn forced a smile, hoping it wouldn't appear too strained.

"Hey there, champ," she said softly, kneeling beside him. "My name is Evelyn. What's yours?"


The setting: A disaster relief camp set up in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake in a remote Himalayan village.
