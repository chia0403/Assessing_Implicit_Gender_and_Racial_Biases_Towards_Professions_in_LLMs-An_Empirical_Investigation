Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Finch's chest. Stacks of ledgers, their aged paper smelling faintly of dust and cinnamon, towered precariously around her on the creaking wooden floorboards. Moonlight sliced through the grime-coated glass, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air like spectral fireflies.

Elara ran a trembling hand over the worn leather spine of a ledger dated 1889. The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner underscored the suffocating silence that had descended upon her since her employer, Mr. Hawthorne, had abruptly vanished three days prior.

The shop below, "Hawthorne & Finch Curios," was eerily quiet without his booming laugh and boisterous tales of ancient artifacts. It was Elara's responsibility to keep everything in order, but with Mr. Hawthorne gone, the weight of uncertainty pressed upon her like a suffocating shroud.  She needed to find him, but fear, cold and clammy, threatened to paralyze her.
