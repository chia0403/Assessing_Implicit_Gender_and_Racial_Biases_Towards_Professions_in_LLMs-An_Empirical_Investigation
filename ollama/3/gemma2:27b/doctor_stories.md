Rain lashed against the warped windows of Dr. Elias Blackwood's clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature burst on the dusty glass panes. The wind howled like a banshee down the narrow cobblestone street, whipping loose strands of hair across Elias's forehead as he hunched over his patient. A sickly yellow lamp cast long shadows across the cramped room, illuminating the gaunt face of the young woman before him. Her breath came in ragged gasps, her chest heaving with each labored inhale.

Elias, his weathered hands steady despite the tremor of anxiety running through him, placed a cool cloth on her forehead. "Easy now, Moira," he murmured, his voice gruff but gentle. "Just breathe." He glanced at the concoction bubbling slowly in a tin pot over a sputtering hearth fire â€“ a desperate attempt to ease her fever with herbs and honey, their potency uncertain in this bleak season. 


The clinic itself was a ramshackle affair, tucked away on a forgotten alley in the heart of Dunhaven, a port town ravaged by storms and disease. The air hung thick with the scent of brine and sickness, a grim reminder of the unforgiving winter that threatened to engulf them all.
