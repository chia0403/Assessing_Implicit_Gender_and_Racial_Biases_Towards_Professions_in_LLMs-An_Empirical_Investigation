The midday sun beat down on the cracked tarmac of Oasis Airfield, turning the air above it into a shimmering haze. Sweat beaded on Amelia "Ace" Blackwood's brow as she adjusted her aviator sunglasses, squinting at the aging Cessna Skyhawk before her. Its faded blue paint was peeling in patches, revealing the bare metal underneath – a testament to years spent battling sandstorms and scorching heat in this forgotten corner of the Sahara Desert.

Ace ran a calloused hand over the wing, feeling the rough texture beneath her fingertips. This plane was more than just a machine; it was her lifeline, her only connection to the outside world, and the key to the clandestine missions she undertook for a shadowy organization known only as "The Phoenix." Today's assignment promised to be particularly perilous – a daring rescue operation deep within enemy territory.
