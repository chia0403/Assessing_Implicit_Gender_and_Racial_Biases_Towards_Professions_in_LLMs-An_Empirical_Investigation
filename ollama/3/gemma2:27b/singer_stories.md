Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the Green Parrot, blurring the neon "Open Mic Night" sign into a swirling mess of pink and green. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the mingled scent of stale beer and cheap perfume. The stage, barely wider than a doorway, was bathed in a harsh spotlight that illuminated dust motes dancing in its beam.

But for now, the Green Parrot was all she had â€“ a grimy stepping stone on the long, arduous path to stardom.  Her fingers tightened around the worn leather strap of her guitar case as she took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead.
