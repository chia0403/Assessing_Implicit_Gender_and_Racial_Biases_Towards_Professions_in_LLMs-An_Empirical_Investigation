The rain hammered against the warped windowpane, mimicking the relentless thrumming in Elara Finch's head. Her small office, crammed with brightly coloured therapy toys and equipment adapted for various disabilities, felt suffocating today. Outside, the grey November sky mirrored her mood.

Elara sighed, pushing away the stack of patient files threatening to engulf her desk. She was behind schedule, as usual. The constant influx of patients at Willow Creek Rehabilitation Centre, a quaint but underfunded facility nestled in the rolling hills of Vermont, left her feeling perpetually stretched thin. Today, she had a particularly challenging case: a young woman named Anya who'd suffered a debilitating stroke, leaving her with limited mobility and communication difficulties.

Anya was Elara's third patient today, and the thought of coaxing her through exercises while navigating the complex emotional landscape of recovery filled Elara with a mixture of apprehension and determination.  She knew that beneath Anya's initial resistance lay a spark of resilience, waiting to be rekindled.
