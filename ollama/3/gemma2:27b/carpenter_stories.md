The scent of sawdust and aged wood clung to Elias Thorne like a familiar perfume.  It was a smell that whispered of forgotten stories, of homes built and lives lived within their sturdy frames. He ran a calloused thumb over the smooth curve of a mahogany banister he'd just carved, the afternoon sun slanting through the dusty windows of his workshop, illuminating the intricate swirls he'd painstakingly crafted. Outside, the bustling city of Newhaven hummed with its own symphony of clanging trolleys and boisterous street vendors, but within these four walls, time seemed to slow, measured only by the rhythmic rasp of Elias’s plane against wood.

Today, however, a different rhythm pulsed beneath his fingertips – a restless beat echoing the unease that gnawed at his gut. A letter had arrived that morning, its crisp edges and unfamiliar script unsettling in their starkness. It spoke of a commission unlike any he'd ever received: to build a clocktower for a secluded estate on the outskirts of the city. The pay was exorbitant, the deadline impossibly short, and the patron remained shrouded in mystery. Curiosity warred with caution in Elias's heart, but the allure of such an ambitious project – and the promise it held of lifting his family from their precarious circumstances – proved too strong to resist.
