Rain hammered against the frosted glass windowpane, blurring the neon glow of " Serenity Massage & Wellness" into an iridescent smear. Inside, Elara Solstice lit a lavender-scented candle, its flame dancing in defiance of the dreary twilight. The usual symphony of city sounds - honking horns, rumbling buses, distant sirens - was muted by the relentless downpour.

Elara, with her long auburn braid draped over one shoulder and gentle hazel eyes reflecting the flickering candlelight, inhaled deeply.  She loved rainy evenings like this; they brought a quiet calm to her tiny studio nestled in the heart of bustling Greenwich Village. Tonight, she had only one appointment - Mrs. Petrov, a regular client battling chronic back pain. As Elara prepared the massage oil, a familiar knot of anxiety tightened in her chest. Lately, something felt off, a subtle disharmony vibrating beneath the surface of her usually tranquil world.
