The pungent scent of chlorine bleach battled with the acrid tang of rust as Elias Montgomery wrestled with the ancient pipes beneath Mrs. Higgins' kitchen sink.  His forehead was slick with sweat, his flannel shirt clinging damply to his back. Sunlight, filtered through grimy kitchen windowpanes, cast long shadows across the cluttered linoleum floor. The rhythmic drip, drip, drip from a stubborn leak mocked Elias's efforts.

Elias, a man built like an oak tree but with a temperament as gentle as moss, sighed. He loved his job - bringing order to chaos in the form of leaky faucets and clogged drains - but sometimes the plumbing gods seemed determined to test him. Mrs. Higgins, perched precariously on a wobbly kitchen chair, watched him with anxious eyes.

"Think you'll be able to fix it, Elias?" she asked, her voice thin and wavering.

Elias wiped his brow with a grease-stained rag. "Don't you worry, Mrs. Higgins," he said with a reassuring smile. "We'll have this sorted out in no time." But as he surveyed the labyrinthine network of pipes, a knot of apprehension tightened in his stomach. This wasn't just any ordinary leak.
