The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor filled the sterile air, a constant reminder of the life hanging precariously in the balance. Sweat beaded on Eleanor's upper lip despite the frigid temperature. This wasn't just another appendectomy or gallbladder removal; this was a complex aortic aneurysm repair, a surgery that demanded her full attention and every ounce of her skill.

Eleanor knew the risks - even with her years of experience, this was a surgery with a high chance of complications. But Silas's wife, her face etched with worry and hope, had squeezed Eleanor's hand before they wheeled him into the OR, pleading "Please save him."
