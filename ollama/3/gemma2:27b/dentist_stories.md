The stale scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a perpetual reminder of Eleanor Blythe’s vocation.  Even after 15 years practicing dentistry in the quiet coastal town of Seahaven, the smell hadn't lost its peculiar ability to both comfort and nauseate her. Today, however, it was punctuated by something else: the tang of saltwater carried on a brisk autumn wind.

Eleanor peered through the dusty windowpane of her waiting room. Beyond the geraniums struggling in their terracotta pots, she saw churning grey waves cresting against the weathered pier. It mirrored the unease swirling within her own chest. Today was unlike any other day at Blythe Family Dentistry. Today, a stranger was coming – a patient who promised to unravel secrets Eleanor had kept buried for years.
