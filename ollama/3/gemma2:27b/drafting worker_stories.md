The acrid smell of graphite hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of stale coffee and the whirring symphony of forgotten fans. Elias Thorne hunched over his drafting table, the pale blue light of the desk lamp casting long shadows across the intricate network of lines sprawling on the vellum sheet before him. Outside, the late afternoon sun painted streaks of orange and purple across the grimy windows of the dilapidated office building, a silent reminder that Elias had been lost in his work for hours. 

The once bustling drafting department was now a ghost of its former self. Empty desks gathered dust, their surfaces littered with abandoned pencils and forgotten rulers. The rhythmic clatter of typewriters had long since been replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by the occasional squeak of Elias's chair and the soft scratch of his pencil against the vellum. 

Elias, a man whose life was measured in precise angles and meticulously scaled drawings, felt a growing sense of unease as he worked. His latest assignment, the blueprints for a new skyscraper that seemed to defy the laws of physics, held an unsettling mystery that gnawed at him. The lines were all there, perfectly aligned and proportioned, yet something felt off. It was as if the building itself whispered secrets, secrets Elias desperately wanted to uncover.
