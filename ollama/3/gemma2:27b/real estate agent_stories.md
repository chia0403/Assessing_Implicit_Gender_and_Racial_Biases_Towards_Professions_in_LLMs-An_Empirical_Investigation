Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Evelyn Hawthorne's office, blurring the already dismal view of the industrial park. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. A faded poster advertising "Charming Victorian Homes" clung to the wall like a forgotten promise, its colors washed out by years of neglect.  Evelyn sighed, her fingers drumming a restless rhythm on her mahogany desk â€“ an heirloom from a grandmother who believed real estate was a respectable profession. 

Today, Evelyn was questioning that belief. Her phone remained stubbornly silent, reflecting the barren landscape of her client list. She'd poured her heart and soul into this business, but lately, it felt like she was swimming upstream against a relentless current. The once-thriving housing market had dried up, leaving behind a wasteland of foreclosures and abandoned dreams. 


The insistent ring of the phone startled Evelyn from her reverie.  She snatched the receiver, her voice tight with anticipation, "Evelyn Hawthorne speaking."
