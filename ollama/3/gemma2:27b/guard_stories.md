The icy wind whistled through the gaps in Silas Blackwood's furs, biting at his exposed cheeks despite the fire roaring merrily within the brazier he stood beside. The flickering flames painted grotesque shadows on the towering obsidian walls surrounding him, making the ancient glyphs carved into the stone writhe and twist like serpents. 

Silas, a grizzled veteran with eyes as blue as glacier ice and a beard like tangled iron wire, tightened his grip on his spear. He'd been stationed at the Gate of Shadows for ten years, guarding against whatever nightmares might seep through from the obsidian-shrouded realm beyond. Ten years of silence, punctuated only by the howling wind and the occasional screech of a raven circling overhead. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling unease crawled beneath Silas's skin, whispering of unseen dangers. The shadows seemed deeper, the glyphs more menacing, and even the wind carried a strange, metallic tang.

He shifted his weight, spear held at the ready, and stared into the swirling black mist beyond the gate. Something was coming. He could feel it in his bones.
