The morning mist clung to Elias Thorne like a damp shroud as he surveyed the sprawling expanse of Mrs. Hemlock's estate. Dewdrops sparkled on the manicured lawns, casting tiny rainbows in the first rays of dawn. The air hummed with the drowsy buzz of cicadas and the distant cawing of crows. Elias, his weathered face etched with years spent under the sun, ran a calloused hand over the rough bark of an ancient oak, its branches reaching out like gnarled fingers towards the pale sky. He inhaled deeply, the scent of freshly cut grass mingling with damp earth and blooming roses â€“ a familiar symphony that always calmed him. Today, however, a sense of unease pricked at him. Something felt off about Mrs. Hemlock's normally serene garden. The meticulously arranged flowerbeds seemed strangely devoid of color, the vibrant blooms replaced by withered husks. A shiver ran down Elias' spine as he noticed a cluster of dark, thorny roses growing where delicate lilies should have bloomed. These weren't ordinary roses; their petals were an unsettling shade of crimson, almost black, and they pulsed with an eerie luminescence.  Elias had never seen anything like them before.
