Elias Thorne, his forearms corded with muscle from years of wielding hammer and chisel, squinted against the glare as he surveyed his latest block.

The quarry echoed with the rhythmic clang of hammers against stone, punctuated by the occasional sharp crack as a chisel bit through stubborn marble. Elias loved this sound, this symphony of creation. Each blow was a conversation with the stone, coaxing out its hidden beauty, revealing the sculpture yearning to be born. Today, though, a restless energy hummed beneath his skin. 

He couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change, a tremor in the air as tangible as the dust settling on his weathered boots.
