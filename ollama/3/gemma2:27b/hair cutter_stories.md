The humid Miami air clung to Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez like a second skin as she navigated the bustling Calle Ocho. Salsa music pulsed from open doorways, mingling with the scent of cafecito and frying plantains. Above her head, strings of brightly colored paper flags fluttered in the breeze, casting dancing shadows on the sidewalk. Esme weaved through the crowd, her toolbox bouncing against her hip, heading towards "La Bella Luna," her tiny hair salon tucked away on a side street.

Inside, the air was cooler, thick with the scent of coconut oil and hairspray. Sunlight streamed through the large window at the front, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. A single ceiling fan whirred lazily, struggling to combat the heat. Esme set her toolbox down with a sigh, surveying the familiar space. It wasn't much - just two chairs, a worn sink, and a mirror reflecting a lifetime of dreams â€“ but it was hers.
