Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the rickety diner, each drop a miniature explosion.  The greasy smell of fried onions and old coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the damp scent of earth and decaying leaves that seeped in through the warped doorframe. Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont, notepad clutched tightly in her hand, squinted at the man across from her. His face, weathered like a forgotten tombstone, was obscured by the shadows cast from the flickering neon sign outside. 

He was a drifter, she'd learned - called himself Silas. He claimed to have information about the disappearances plaguing Harmony Creek, a sleepy town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains where secrets clung to the mist like cobwebs. Ellie, a journalist for the struggling "Harmony Herald," smelled a story, one that could finally put her paper on the map. But Silas, with his shifty eyes and cryptic pronouncements, was proving to be a difficult source.  

"They're taken, Miss Beaumont," he rasped, his voice gravelly like stones grinding together. "Taken by somethingâ€¦ unnatural."
