The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' neck like a blacksmith's hammer, driving sweat into his eyes. He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, squinting at the patchwork of shingles spread out before him like a giant, broken jigsaw puzzle. Bart was perched precariously atop Mrs. O'Malley's three-story Victorian, its ornate gables and turrets casting long shadows across the overgrown lawn. 

The air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and tar, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of Bart's hammer against the slate tiles. Below him, the street bustled with summer life - children shrieked on bicycles, a dog barked incessantly, and the faint melody of an ice cream truck drifted through the humid air. But Bart was oblivious to it all, his focus narrowed to the task at hand: replacing a section of roof damaged by last week's hailstorm.
