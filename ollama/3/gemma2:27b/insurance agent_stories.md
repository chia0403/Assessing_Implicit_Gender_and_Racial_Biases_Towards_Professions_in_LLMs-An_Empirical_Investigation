The late afternoon sun, filtered through the dusty blinds of Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's office window, cast long stripes across her overflowing desk. Papers, policy applications, and half-eaten granola bars formed treacherous hills amidst a sea of spreadsheets. Outside, the honking symphony of rush hour traffic in downtown Chicago punctuated Ellie’s sigh as she stared at the latest claim denial letter. 

It wasn't her fault Mr. Henderson's antique gramophone had been "mysteriously" swallowed by a sinkhole, but it was her responsibility to explain – yet again – why his homeowner's insurance didn't cover acts of God with peculiar appetites for vintage sound systems. Ellie loved helping people, truly she did, but lately the bureaucratic labyrinth of insurance felt more like a Kafkaesque nightmare than a path to security and peace of mind.
