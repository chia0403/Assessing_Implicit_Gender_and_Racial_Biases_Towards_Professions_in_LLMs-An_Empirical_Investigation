The air in the Grand Sapphire Hotel lobby hummed with a low-frequency thrum – a symphony of arriving guests, clinking champagne flutes, and the ceaseless murmur of gossip traveling between polished marble columns. Elias Montgomery III, bellhop extraordinaire, navigated the chaos with practiced ease. His crisp navy uniform, meticulously ironed by his grandmother each week, stood out against the swirling tapestry of tourists and businessmen. He balanced a precarious tower of suitcases on a trolley, his eyes scanning for room numbers like a hawk searching for prey. 

Elias loved the Grand Sapphire – its faded grandeur, the ghosts of forgotten waltzes echoing in the gilded ballroom, the secret passageways whispered about by the older staff. It was more than just a job; it was a portal to another world, one where dreams and desires mingled under crystal chandeliers and velvet drapes. But tonight felt different. An unsettling shiver crawled down Elias's spine as a lone woman stepped through the revolving door, her emerald eyes scanning the room with an intensity that made him pause. Dressed in a cloak of deepest black, she emanated a strange aura – one that spoke of hidden secrets and whispered dangers.
