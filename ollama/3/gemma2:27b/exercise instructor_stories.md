Sweat beaded on Elara Skye's forehead, mirroring the glistening droplets clinging to the neon pink weights in her hand. The thumping bassline reverberated through the mirrored walls of "Pulse Fitness," reflecting off the bodies of twenty eager participants.  Elara's voice boomed over the music, encouraging them to push harder, dig deeper, unleash their inner athlete.

"One more rep!" she shouted, her toned arms flexing as she demonstrated a perfect bicep curl. The participants, a motley crew of office workers, retirees, and college students, gritted their teeth and followed suit, pushing through the burn in their muscles. 

But even as Elara's infectious energy fueled the room, a nagging unease tugged at her. A series of strange events – anonymous notes left on her car windshield, flickering lights in the gym, a feeling of being constantly watched – had been plaguing her for weeks. Today, it felt amplified, a prickling sensation crawling up her spine despite the exertion and the heat radiating from the studio.
