The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Ms. Eleanor Rosalind Beaumont's office. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered desk piled high with student transcripts, college brochures, and half-eaten granola bars. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray curl away from her forehead.

It was the second week of May, a time when senior anxiety levels spiked higher than caffeine intake in this particular school district. Students swarmed her office like anxious bees, buzzing with questions about scholarships, deadlines, and the terrifying abyss that awaited them beyond graduation: the "real world." Eleanor, however, felt more adrift than any of her charges. 

This year felt different. A pervasive unease had settled over the student body, a disquiet that transcended typical pre-college jitters. Whispers of strange occurrences echoed through the hallways, rumors of flickering lights, phantom footsteps, and objects inexplicably moving on their own. Eleanor dismissed it as teenage hysteria at first, but lately, even she couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling that something was amiss...something beyond the realm of standardized tests and college applications.
