The air in The Rusty Mug hung thick with the smell of stale beer and greasy fries, a comforting aroma to Eleanor "Ellie" Carmichael's nose.  She weaved between sticky tables, her tray laden with steaming mugs of coffee and plates piled high with blueberry pancakes. 

The diner was a beacon in the otherwise desolate stretch of Highway 17, its neon sign flickering like a tired heartbeat against the pre-dawn gloom. Truckers huddled over lukewarm cups, their faces etched with weariness, while a lone businessman tapped away on his laptop, ignoring the insistent chirping of his phone.  Ellie knew each regular by name and order, anticipating refills before they even asked. 

But today felt different. A nervous energy thrummed beneath the familiar rhythm of the diner. Ellie couldn't place it, just a prickling sense that something was about to shift, like the stillness before a storm.
