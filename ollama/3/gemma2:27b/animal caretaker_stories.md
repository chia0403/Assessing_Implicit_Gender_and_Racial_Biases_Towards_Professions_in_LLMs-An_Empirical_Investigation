The pungent scent of eucalyptus and damp earth hung heavy in the air as Elara Blackwood crouched beneath the sprawling limbs of an ancient gum tree. A chorus of kookaburras erupted from the canopy above, their raucous laughter echoing through the Australian bush. Elara, her freckled face framed by a tangle of auburn curls, carefully examined a young wombat nestled in her arms. Its soft fur was matted with dirt and its eyes were dull and unfocused.

This was the heart of Blackwood Sanctuary, Elara's haven: a sprawling reserve dedicated to rehabilitating injured and orphaned native animals.
