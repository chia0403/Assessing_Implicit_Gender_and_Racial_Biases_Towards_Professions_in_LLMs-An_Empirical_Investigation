Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her own chest.  The plush armchair across from her sat empty, an unsettling vacuum in the usually warm space. It had been fifteen minutes since Amelia, her 3:00 appointment, was due. This wasn't like Amelia; she was punctual to a fault, always arriving with a neatly organized planner and a list of topics to discuss. Eleanor checked her phone - no messages.

Amelia's absence gnawed at Eleanor. The young woman had been struggling with crippling social anxiety, making the simplest interactions feel monumental.  Eleanor had felt confident in their progress, but now doubt crept in like the chill autumn air seeping through the cracks in the window frame. Something felt wrong. 

The old Victorian house that housed Eleanor's practice creaked and groaned around her, its age a stark contrast to the modern anxieties she helped her clients navigate. Nestled on a quiet street lined with ancient oaks, it was a sanctuary for Eleanor, a place where she could offer solace and guidance. But today, even the familiar scent of lavender oil and beeswax candles couldn't quell the growing unease in Eleanor's stomach.

Something had happened to Amelia. Eleanor knew it.
