Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, drumming a relentless rhythm that mirrored the anxiety churning in Elara Blackwood's stomach.  The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and wet dog fur, a familiar comfort in this small, rural clinic nestled on the edge of the Blue Ridge Mountains.

Elara, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, peered through the window at the swirling grey sky. The power flickered ominously, casting the waiting room in an unsettling strobe effect. She sighed, smoothing down the wrinkles in her worn green scrubs.  It was already past closing time, and the last patient, a skittish terrier named Pipsqueak with a nasty case of ear mites, had finally left with its relieved owner.

Yet, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. A cold wind seemed to seep through the cracks in the old building, whispering an unsettling warning.  Her gaze drifted towards the dusty medicine cabinet at the back of the room, where a single lantern flickered precariously. As the wind howled outside and the power flickered once more, plunging the clinic into darkness, Elara swore she heard a low growl coming from the far end of the building, followed by the distinct sound of heavy paws padding on the wooden floorboards.
