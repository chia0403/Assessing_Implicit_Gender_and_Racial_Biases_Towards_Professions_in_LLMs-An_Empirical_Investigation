The insistent chirping of the phone tore Elara Nightingale from her daydream. A sigh escaped her lips as she reached for the receiver, already bracing herself for another disgruntled customer complaining about the exorbitant prices or the baffling menu at The Golden Perch. 

Elara sat perched behind a polished mahogany desk in the opulent lobby of the restaurant. The air was thick with the aroma of roasted garlic and thyme, a tantalizing scent that only served to highlight her own rumbling stomach. Through the arched doorway, she could glimpse the bustling dining room, filled with patrons dressed in their finest attire, laughing and clinking glasses. It seemed a world away from her own cramped cubicle, where the fluorescent lighting hummed incessantly and the only company was a plastic fern perpetually shedding faux leaves.
