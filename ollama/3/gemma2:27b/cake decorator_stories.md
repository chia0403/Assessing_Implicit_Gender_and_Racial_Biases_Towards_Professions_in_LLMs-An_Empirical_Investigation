The whir of the stand mixer battled with the insistent chirping of cicadas outside Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Cartwright's bakery window.  Flour dusted the air, catching the afternoon sunlight streaming through the panes and turning it into a swirling, ethereal dance. Amy hummed along to the radio, her focus laser-sharp as she piped delicate sugar roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake frosted in ivory buttercream. The scent of vanilla and almond hung heavy in the humid air, a comforting blanket against the relentless Georgia heat.

Today was crucial. This wasn't just any wedding; it was for Mayor Blackwood's daughter, a socialite whose every whim was splashed across the local newspaper. Amy had poured her heart and soul into this masterpiece, painstakingly hand-painting edible peonies on each tier and crafting a sugar sculpture of doves taking flight. One wrong move, one smudge of icing, could ruin everything.

As she reached for another piping bag, filled with shimmering silver fondant, the bell above the bakery door jingled. A wave of cool air swept in, bringing with it the scent of ozone and freshly cut grass. Amy turned, expecting to see a regular customer, but instead, her eyes met the intense gaze of a stranger. He was tall and lean, with dark hair that fell over his forehead like a unruly curtain and eyes the color of storm clouds.

His presence, somehow both alluring and unsettling, sent a shiver down Amy's spine.  "Can I help you?" she asked hesitantly, her voice betraying a touch of nervousness.

The stranger smiled, a slow, enigmatic curl of his lips. "I believe," he said, his voice low and melodic, "you have something that belongs to me."
