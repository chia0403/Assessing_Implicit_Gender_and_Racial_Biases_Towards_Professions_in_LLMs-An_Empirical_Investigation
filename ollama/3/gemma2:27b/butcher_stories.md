The greasy air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary, clinging to Thaddeus Bartholomew Quill like a second skin. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Grimsborough were slick with rain, reflecting the gaslights in a shimmering, distorted dance. Inside "Quill's Cuts," however, the world was warm and meaty. Sides of beef hung from hooks, their crimson flesh glistening under the dim light.

Thaddeus, his broad shoulders hunched over a cleaver-scarred block, expertly deboned a plump chicken, his calloused fingers working with practiced ease. The rhythmic thud of bone meeting wood punctuated the silence, a familiar counterpoint to the hiss of the coals in the nearby oven where loaves of rye bread were baking.

He paused, wiping a smear of blood from his brow with a stained linen cloth. A shiver ran down his spine, an icy fingertip tracing the nape of his neck. Something wasn't right. The usual bustling Saturday morning crowd was conspicuously absent. Even Mrs. Higgins, with her incessant demands for "just the tips" of the lamb chops, was nowhere to be seen.
