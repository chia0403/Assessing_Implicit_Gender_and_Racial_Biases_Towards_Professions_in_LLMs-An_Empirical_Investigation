The aroma of cardamom and ginger wafted from Elodie Camille Beaumont's kitchen, mingling with the sharp scent of turmeric. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting a warm glow on the overflowing countertop. Bowls brimming with vibrant vegetables, plump berries, and ancient grains awaited their transformation into a symphony of flavor and nutrition. Elodie, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, hummed along to a French chanson as she chopped kale with practiced precision.

Elodie wasn't just any nutritionist; she was a culinary alchemist, transforming ordinary ingredients into extraordinary dishes that nourished both body and soul. Her clients weren't seeking fad diets or quick fixes; they craved sustainable well-being, and Elodie was their guide on that journey.  Today, however, her usual calm was disrupted by a gnawing unease. A letter lay unopened on the table beside her, its stark white envelope promising news she dreaded.

Elodie knew this day would come, but knowing it wouldn't lessen the blow. She took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and reached for the letter, bracing herself for whatever awaited within its folds.
