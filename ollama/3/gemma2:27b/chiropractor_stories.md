Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Emilia Flores' practice, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into a shimmering smear. The rhythmic drumming was oddly soothing, counterpointing the insistent throb in her right temple. A migraine, unwelcome as it always was, threatened to derail her entire afternoon. She sighed, massaging her forehead with two fingers, and glanced at the clock.

Three-thirty p.m. Just one more patient before she could head home and surrender to a hot bath and chamomile tea. Emilia straightened the stack of intake forms on her desk, her gaze lingering on the familiar logo embossed on each page: "Align & Thrive Chiropractic." Her practice, nestled in a quiet corner of bustling downtown Seattle, felt like an oasis amidst the urban chaos.

The bell above the door jingled, pulling Emilia from her thoughts. A tall figure, shrouded in the gloom of the storm outside, hesitated in the doorway before stepping inside, shaking rain from his dark, windswept hair. He looked up, his emerald eyes meeting hers with a curious intensity.
