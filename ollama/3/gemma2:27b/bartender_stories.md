Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Last Call" sign into an impressionist smear. Inside, Silas Blackwood, his salt-and-pepper beard flecked with stray bitters, polished a glass with practiced precision. The rhythmic swish of the bar towel was the only sound competing with the mournful symphony outside.

Silas's establishment wasn't much to look at: chipped Formica countertop, mismatched stools that creaked like arthritic knees, and a dusty jukebox perpetually stuck on blues standards. But for the denizens of Grimhaven – a town perpetually shrouded in mist and shadowed by its industrial past – it was a sanctuary, a place where secrets were spilled as freely as the whiskey Silas poured.
