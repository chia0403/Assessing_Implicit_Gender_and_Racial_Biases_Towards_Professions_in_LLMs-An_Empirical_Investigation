The neon sign flickered, casting an erratic red glow on Silas Jeremiah "Si" Blackwood's weathered face. It read "Last Chance Diner - Coffee Hotter Than Hell." Si snorted; hell had nothing on the bitter brew he'd already downed that morning. He gripped the chipped mug tighter, the warmth doing little to penetrate the chill that seeped into his bones from the relentless Montana wind. 

His rig, a hulking Peterbilt affectionately nicknamed "The Iron Horse," sat patiently in the diner's lot, its chrome glinting under the sodium lamps. Si had been hauling lumber from Missoula to Billings for three days straight, and the endless stretch of highway was starting to wear on him. The monotony, punctuated only by the drone of the engine and the occasional crackling static from his CB radio, made him feel like a cog in a giant, impersonal machine.

He glanced at the clock above the counter - 3:17 AM. He needed rest, but he couldn't afford to lose another hour. The deadline loomed, and Si Blackwood prided himself on delivering on time, every time. But tonight, something felt different. An unease settled in his gut, a prickling sensation that whispered of danger lurking just beyond the horizon.
