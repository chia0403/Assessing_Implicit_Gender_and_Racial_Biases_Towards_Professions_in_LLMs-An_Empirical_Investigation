The first tendrils of dawn were just beginning to paint the sky with pale lavender and rose gold when Elias Thornwood unlocked the rusted gate to Blackwood Manor. The air hung heavy with dew, each blade of grass shimmering like emerald jewels. A symphony of birdsong echoed through the ancient oaks that lined the gravel driveway, their leaves still clinging stubbornly to branches despite the encroaching autumn chill.

Elias, a man weathered by years of sun and toil, surveyed his domain with a sigh. Blackwood Manor was a grand, if somewhat dilapidated, Victorian mansion perched atop a hill overlooking the sleepy village of Oakhaven. He'd been its groundskeeper for twenty years, ever since Mr. Blackwood, the eccentric owner, had passed away leaving no heirs. Now, the manor stood empty, its windows like vacant eyes staring out over the sprawling gardens Elias tended with unwavering devotion.

Today, however, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, perhaps, or an unsettling stillness that seemed to hush even the birdsong. As Elias pushed his wheelbarrow down the path towards the rose garden, a prickling sensation crawled up his spine. He couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone.
