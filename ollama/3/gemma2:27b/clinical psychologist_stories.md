Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic swirl of gray and yellow. The incessant drumming was a fitting soundtrack for Eleanor's mood - heavy, oppressive, and tinged with a bitter sense of foreboding.  Her mahogany desk, usually pristine, held a chaotic jumble of papers – case files spilling open, research journals strewn haphazardly, a half-eaten sandwich perched precariously on the edge. The usual calming scent of lavender from her diffuser was overwhelmed by the metallic tang of Eleanor's anxiety.

Today was different. Today, Eleanor wasn't facing the familiar anxieties and neuroses of her regular patients. Today, she was waiting for a man who claimed to have memories he couldn't possibly possess – vivid recollections of events that had never happened, whispered promises of forgotten truths. A shiver ran down Eleanor's spine.  Was this a case of delusion, a fractured mind grasping at straws? Or something far more unsettling, something that threatened to shatter the very foundations of her understanding?
