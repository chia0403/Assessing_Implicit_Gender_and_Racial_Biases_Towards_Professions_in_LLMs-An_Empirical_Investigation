Dust devils danced across the sun-scorched plains, twisting and swirling like restless spirits. The air hung thick and heavy, punctuated by the relentless drone of cicadas. Jasper Clayborne, his weathered face etched with years spent under the unforgiving Wyoming sun, squinted at the horizon. His calloused hands tightened around the reins of his trusty Appaloosa mare, Daisy. They stood atop a low rise overlooking his sprawling ranch, the vastness of his land stretching out before them like a rumpled patchwork quilt.

Jasper's heart sank as he surveyed his fields. The once vibrant green pasture was now withered and brown, the relentless drought taking its toll. He could barely make out the skeletal figures of cattle grazing listlessly in the distance, their ribs stark against their dusty hides.
