The humid air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and frying plantains as Elara Reyes navigated the cobblestone streets of Old San Juan. Her worn espadrilles clicked rhythmically against the stones, a counterpoint to the lilting salsa music spilling from a nearby doorway.  Sunlight glinted off the pastel-colored buildings, their balconies overflowing with bougainvillea and hibiscus. Tourists trailed behind her, captivated by Elara's infectious enthusiasm as she wove tales of pirates, conquistadors, and hidden treasures. Today's group was a motley crew: an elderly couple from Nebraska clutching selfie sticks, a trio of boisterous college students already sporting sunburn, and a young woman with wide, curious eyes who seemed to absorb every word Elara spoke. 

Elara paused in front of the imposing iron gates of Castillo San Felipe del Morro, the ancient fortress looming above them like a sentinel. "This," she announced, her voice ringing with pride, "is one of the most impressive fortifications in the Caribbean." As she launched into a detailed description of its history, a shiver ran down her spine. It wasn't just the cool breeze blowing off the Atlantic; something felt...off. A sense of unease she couldn't quite explain settled upon her, like a whisper on the wind.
