The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck, turning his already sweat-soaked collar redder than the reflective paint on the orange cones lining the shoulder. The asphalt shimmered in the midday heat, making the long stretch of Highway 57 look like a mirage shimmering in the distance. Silas squinted through the haze, watching for any errant vehicles swerving into the closed lane he and his crew were painstakingly repaving.  

He'd been doing this job for ten years, ever since he'd left high school with a diploma tucked under one arm and dreams of becoming a mechanic under the other. Life, as it often does, had a different plan. Now, Silas spent his days surrounded by roaring machinery, plumes of dust, and the constant drone of traffic whizzing by just feet away.  

But today was different. Today, something felt off. A prickling sensation on the back of his neck, an unsettling stillness in the air â€“ these were not the usual sensations he associated with a hot summer day on Highway 57.
