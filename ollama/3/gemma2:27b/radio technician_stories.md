The acrid scent of solder and ozone hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Finch, master radio technician and proprietor of Finch's Finest Fixes. Outside, the Nevada sun beat down on the dusty town of Tumbleweed Gulch, baking the corrugated iron roof of his workshop until it shimmered like a mirage. 

Elias himself, a man weathered by years spent tinkering under the unforgiving desert sky, was hunched over a vintage Philco radio, its wooden casing scarred and chipped but its innards promising a symphony once he coaxed them back to life. The rhythmic clicks of his pliers, punctuated by the occasional muttered curse under his breath, were the only sounds breaking the oppressive silence. 


He hadn't had a customer in days, which was unusual for this time of year. Tumbleweed Gulch thrived on gossip and news, delivered primarily through the crackle and hiss of radios like the one he was currently wrestling with. The drought had been hard on everyone, though, making even the most devout listeners tighten their belts. Elias suspected the silence was due to his meager clientele saving every dime they could for a better future, one hopefully less arid and more prosperous.
