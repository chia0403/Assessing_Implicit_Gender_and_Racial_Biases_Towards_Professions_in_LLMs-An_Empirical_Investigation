Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Blackwood Manor, each gust sounding like a skeletal hand clawing at the aged glass. Eleanor Finchley sighed, her breath fogging the air as she surveyed the grand, yet decaying drawing room. Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that managed to pierce the gloom, illuminating faded tapestries depicting hunts long past and portraits of stern-faced ancestors with eyes that seemed to follow Eleanor’s every move. The once vibrant velvet upholstery was now threadbare and dull, reflecting the manor's forlorn state.

Eleanor had been the housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for fifteen years, ever since her own parents passed away. She knew its secrets better than anyone – the creaking floorboards in the west wing, the cold spot in the library where Mr. Blackwood supposedly met his untimely end, and the hidden passage behind the grandfather clock that led to a forgotten wine cellar. But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unnerving energy, a sense of anticipation that prickled at Eleanor's skin.

It wasn't just the storm, she knew. There was something else, a subtle shift in the manor's atmosphere. It began with the arrival of the new mistress, Lady Rosalind Blackwood, a young woman with fiery red hair and eyes that held both intrigue and sorrow.
