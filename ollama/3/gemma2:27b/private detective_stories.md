Rain hammered against the frosted glass of Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood's office window, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" cocktail bar across the street into a hazy smear of red and green. Teddy swiveled in his threadbare leather chair, the springs groaning in protest. The air was thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation â€“ a familiar aroma for anyone who frequented Blackwood Investigations. He tapped a crooked fingernail against the faded photograph on his desk: a young woman with wide, worried eyes and auburn hair cascading down her shoulders like a fiery waterfall. Her name was Amelia Rose Thornton, and she'd vanished three weeks ago without a trace.

Teddy sighed. Missing person cases were always the toughest. They tugged at something deep inside him, an echo of his own lost loved ones, swallowed whole by the unforgiving city. He knew finding Amelia wouldn't be easy, especially in a labyrinthine metropolis like New Haven, where shadows stretched long and secrets whispered on every corner. But he had to try. For Amelia, and for himself.
