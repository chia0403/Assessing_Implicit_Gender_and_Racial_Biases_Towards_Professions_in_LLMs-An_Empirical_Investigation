Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Bargain Bites" sign across the street. The air inside Harold Montgomery's cramped office smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation. Harold himself, a man whose once-sharp suit now hung loosely on his thinning frame, tapped a manicured fingernail against a spreadsheet overflowing with red ink.

But what could possibly spark interest in their latest product - "FlavorFusion," a dubious powdered concoction promising to transform any dish into gourmet heaven?  Harold sighed, the weight of unsold FlavorFusion packets pressing down on him like a physical burden.
