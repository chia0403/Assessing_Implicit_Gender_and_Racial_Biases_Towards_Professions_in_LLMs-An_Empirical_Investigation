The air in the ambulance hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and disinfectant.  Sirens wailed their mournful song through the rain-slicked streets of Baltimore, a soundtrack to Eliza Ramirez's anxiety. She checked the vitals monitor again, her brow furrowing. The young man on the stretcher, barely conscious and pale as bone from blood loss, was fighting for every breath.

Eliza had been an EMT for five years, long enough to know that hope and despair could shift in a heartbeat. Tonight, though, the scales felt tipped dangerously toward the latter. They'd picked him up outside a seedy bar on Pratt Street â€“ victim of a mugging gone wrong, the police report would say later.

Eliza tightened her grip on the IV bag, willing strength into his frail body. "Come on, kid," she murmured, her voice barely audible above the din.  "Don't give up on me now."
