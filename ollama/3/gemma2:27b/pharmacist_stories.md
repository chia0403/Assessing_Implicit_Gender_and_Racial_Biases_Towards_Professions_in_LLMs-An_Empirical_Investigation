Rain lashed against the pharmacy window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an abstract smear of green and red. Emilia Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging the already steamed-up glass. It was 10 pm on a Thursday, and she was the only one left in Havenwood Pharmacy. Usually, Thursdays were bustling with last-minute prescriptions for weekend getaways and the occasional panicked parent needing cough syrup for their sniffling child. But tonight, the town seemed to be holding its breath, hunkering down against the relentless storm.

The rhythmic click of Emilia's fingers on the keyboard was the only sound breaking the silence, punctuated by the occasional groan of the old building settling beneath her feet. She was filling a prescription for Mrs. Henderson's arthritis medication when a shadow flickered past the window. Emilia paused, her heart quickening. Havenwood was a small town, everyone knew everyone, and late-night visitors to the pharmacy were unheard of.

Curiosity warred with caution as she peered out into the storm-ravaged street. The figure had vanished, leaving Emilia staring into the swirling darkness. She told herself it was just a gust of wind playing tricks on her, but a prickle of unease lingered. 


What happens next?
