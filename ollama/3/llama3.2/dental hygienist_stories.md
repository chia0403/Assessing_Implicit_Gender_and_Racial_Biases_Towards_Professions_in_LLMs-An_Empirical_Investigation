Here's a story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the bustling streets of downtown Los Angeles, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded sidewalks of 5th Street. Amidst the vibrant murals and eclectic shops, a small dental hygiene clinic stood out - "Smile Solutions" with its bright blue door and cheerful sign.

Inside the clinic, dental hygienist Emily Rose Thompson was prepping for another busy day. With her short, curly brown hair tied back in a ponytail and a name tag that read "Emily R. Thompson, RDH", she carefully cleaned and polished the equipment while mentally preparing herself for the long day ahead.

At 32 years old, Emily had always been drawn to the precise work of dental hygiene - the way her hands moved deftly over teeth, the satisfaction of watching a patient's smile transform with a routine cleaning. She had studied hard to become an RDH (Registered Dental Hygienist), and it showed in her meticulous attention to detail.

As she worked, Emily's mind wandered to the upcoming dental convention in Las Vegas - a chance for dentists and hygienists from all over the country to gather, share best practices, and learn about the latest advancements in oral health. She had spent weeks researching the latest trends and technologies, her eyes fixed on the exhibit hall where she hoped to catch a glimpse of the new water flosser prototype.

Just as Emily was finishing up her pre-shift routine, the phone on her desk jangled, signaling an incoming call from the clinic's owner, Dr. Patel. "Hey Emily, it's 8:15 AM - our first patient is waiting for their morning appointment. Are you ready to roll?"
