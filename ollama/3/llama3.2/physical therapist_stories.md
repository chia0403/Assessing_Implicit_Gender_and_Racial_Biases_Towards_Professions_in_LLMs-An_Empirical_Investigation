Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emily Alexandra Thompson stepped out of her car and onto the warm asphalt of the parking lot, stretching her arms above her head to work out the kinks from a long day at the office. As a physical therapist specializing in sports injuries, she'd spent most of her career helping athletes recover from grueling seasons and surgeries. Now, as she made her way towards the small, rustic building that housed her private practice, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that this summer was going to be different.

The coastal town of Oakwood had always been a haven for Emily, with its laid-back vibe and stunning ocean views. But it wasn't until her grandmother passed away, leaving her a small inheritance and a worn but charming beachside cottage, that Emily had decided to return to the place she'd called home as a child.

The old house, now lovingly restored by Emily herself, sat perched on a bluff overlooking the sparkling turquoise waters of Oakwood Bay. As she walked towards it, the salty sea air filled her lungs and the sound of seagulls echoed through the streets, transporting her back to carefree summers spent exploring the tide pools and building sandcastles with her siblings.

But today, Emily's mind was focused on the patient waiting for her at home â€“ a young surfer named Jake, who'd suffered a devastating injury in a wipeout last season. She had a feeling that this summer was going to be a crucial one for both her practice and herself, as she worked to help Jake recover from his injury and find his place back on the waves.
