Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the small town of Willow Creek like a relentless curtain, casting a gloomy mist over the streets and homes. Inside the cramped, dimly lit workshop of his family's electrical contracting business, Jack Edward Wilson wiped the sweat from his brow as he worked to repair a faulty transformer for the local hospital. It was a slow day at the office, and the monotony was starting to get to him.

Just as he was about to call it quits for the evening, the phone rang, shrill and insistent. Jack picked up, expecting another routine repair request or perhaps a quote for a new installation. Instead, his voice was met with an unfamiliar tone - low, gravelly, and laced with an air of urgency.

"Wilson Electric? This is Victor Vex from the town council," the voice said. "We need your expertise on something... unusual. Can you meet us at the old clock tower at midnight?"

The line went dead, leaving Jack staring at the receiver in his hand, his mind racing with possibilities.
