As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the bleak, rain-soaked streets of New Haven, Probation Officer Ethan Alexander Wells stood outside the rundown apartment complex, the weight of another long day bearing down on him like the grey sky above. The worn brick facade seemed to absorb the faint glow of the streetlights, casting a foreboding shadow over the narrow alleyways that led to each unit.

Ethan's gaze lingered on the building, his mind replaying the events of the morning - the phone call from a concerned citizen about a potential disturbance, the whispered warnings from colleagues about another volatile case. This one was different, though; this one felt personal.

With a deep breath, Ethan pushed open the metal door and stepped into the foyer, where a scrawny clerk with a permanent air of desperation watched him approach. "Mr. Wells," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Visitation. Room 314."

Ethan's eyes narrowed as he followed her down the narrow corridor, his heart rate quickening ever so slightly. He knew better than to get too comfortable in this world; every step forward came with a corresponding step back into the darkness that lurked within these crumbling walls.

As they reached the door to room 314, Ethan could feel the air thicken with tension - an almost palpable sense of unease emanating from the other side. He raised his voice above the stifling silence and called out, "Ethan Wells, Probation Officer."
