The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of Route 12, casting a golden glow over the desolate stretch of asphalt that stretched out before Highway Worker Ryder Jenson. The rumble of his diesel truck echoed through the stillness as he shifted gears, careful not to disturb the slumbering sandpipers nesting in the shallow ditch alongside the road.

Ryder had been working on this isolated stretch of highway for nearly three decades, watching seasons come and go like a familiar friend.
