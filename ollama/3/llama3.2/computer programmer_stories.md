Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Evelyn Stone trudged through the downpour, her eyes fixed on the neon lights of the coffee shop ahead. A steaming cup of latte waited for her inside, courtesy of her trusty sidekick, the barista who knew better than to ask about Evelyn's latest coding project.

As she pushed open the door and slipped into the warmth within, Evelyn's gaze roamed the cozy cafe, taking in the familiar rhythms of caffeine-fueled productivity. The hum of laptops and gentle chatter created a soothing background noise that usually eased her focus, but tonight, her mind was elsewhere.

Tonight, Evelyn had just received an anonymous email from an old acquaintance who claimed to have information about her estranged sister's disappearance five years ago. A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine as she wondered if this might be the break she'd been waiting for in solving the mystery that had haunted her family for so long.

With a determined glint in her eye, Evelyn settled into her favorite corner table by the window and took a sip of her coffee, ready to dive back into the latest version of her coding project: an AI-powered forensic tool designed to analyze surveillance footage from the fateful night of her sister's disappearance. Little did she know that this project was about to take on a whole new significance â€“ and Evelyn would be about to embark on a journey that would change her life forever.

How is this? I can adjust or add anything you'd like!
