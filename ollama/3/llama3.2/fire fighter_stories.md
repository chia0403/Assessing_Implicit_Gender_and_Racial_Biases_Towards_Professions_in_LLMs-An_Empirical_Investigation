Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a golden glow over the sleepy streets and homes. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of wood smoke and damp earth. In the heart of the town square stood the old fire station, its wooden fa√ßade weathered to a warm brown from years of service.

 Inside, Firefighter Emmet Thaddeus "Em" Thompson sipped his cold coffee, his eyes fixed on the TV as it played a 24-hour news cycle in the background. Em was a seasoned firefighter with over a decade of experience under his belt, having grown up in Ravenswood and learned the ins and outs of the fire department from his father, who had preceded him to the job.

As he sat at his desk, flipping through the morning's newspaper, Em's mind began to wander to the strange calls they'd gotten in the past week. Several reports of mysterious fires in the outlying areas of town, all seemingly unconnected and impossible to explain. The department had dismissed it as pranksterism or faulty wiring, but Em couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Just then, the radio crackled to life, and the dispatcher's voice cut through the quiet morning air. "Engine 17, we have a report of a structure fire at 345 Oak Street. Multiple units en route."
