Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the iconic Golden Empress Hotel cast a gaudy glow over the rain-soaked streets of Las Vegas, Nevada. Inside, the lobby was quiet, save for the soft hum of the chandelier and the gentle clinking of glasses from the bar area. Amidst the opulence and excess, 22-year-old Elijah "El" Thompson, bell hop extraordinaire, stood still as a statue, his bright orange vest a stark contrast to the drab, monochromatic tones of the hotel's interior.

As El polished the brass doorknobs with a white cloth, his eyes scanned the lobby, watching for any signs of trouble. It was 3:47 AM on a Tuesday night, and the Golden Empress was usually bustling with revelers and partygoers. But tonight, something felt off.

Just then, the phone on the desk beside El rang, shrill in the stillness. He picked it up, his voice low and smooth as he answered, "Golden Empress Hotel, this is El speaking."
