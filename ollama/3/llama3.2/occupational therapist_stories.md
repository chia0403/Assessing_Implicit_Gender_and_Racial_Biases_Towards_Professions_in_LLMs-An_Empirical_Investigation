Here's a potential story opening and setting for an occupational therapy novel:

Title: "The Art of Healing"

Opening Scene:

As the warm sunlight streamed through the windows of her small office, casting a golden glow on the vibrant artwork that adorned the walls, Dr. Maya Alexandra Patel smiled to herself. It was going to be one of those days. The kind where everything came together just so, and she felt like she was exactly where she was meant to be.

I just got word that the new children's hospital is opening soon in town. They're looking for an occupational therapist to join their team. Want to come take a look?" Maya's heart skipped a beat as she considered the possibility of this new opportunity...
