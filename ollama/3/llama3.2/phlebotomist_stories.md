As the sun set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes, Phoebe Alexandra Jennings settled into her favorite stool in the cramped break room of Springdale Memorial Hospital. She sipped on her lukewarm coffee, staring out the window at the worn asphalt parking lot where she had spent countless hours collecting blood samples from nervous patients.

Phoebe, a 28-year-old certified phlebotomist with a quick wit and an even quicker draw, had always found solace in the routine of her job. She took pride in being able to put patients at ease with her gentle touch and soothing words, often earning nods of appreciation from even the most anxious individuals. But as she gazed out at the fading light of day, Phoebe's thoughts began to wander â€“ not to the latest medical breakthroughs or hospital gossip, but to the mysterious letter that had arrived in her mailbox just that morning.

The envelope was plain and unmarked, except for a single sentence typed on a plain white sheet: "Meet me at the old oak tree in Oakwood Park at midnight. Come alone." Phoebe's heart skipped a beat as she wondered who could have sent such an enigmatic message, and what they might want with her. As she pushed her chair back from the table and stood up, the break room seemed to grow quieter, as if the very air itself was holding its breath in anticipation of what was to come.
