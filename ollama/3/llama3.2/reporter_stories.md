Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle, Washington, and Emily J. Thompson, a seasoned investigative reporter for the local newspaper, The Emerald City Times, stood at her desk, gazing out the rain-slicked window of her office. The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glow on her determined face as she sifted through the day's news, searching for that one story that would make all the difference.

As a child, Emily had always been fascinated by the darker corners of Seattle, where the city's history and mythology collided with its modern streets. Her parents, both retired police officers, had regaled her with tales of the old-timers' warnings about the cursed Pike Place Market and the haunted Pioneer Square. Now, as a reporter, she was determined to uncover the truth behind the city's most enduring legends.

The phone on her desk jolted Emily out of her reverie, shrill and insistent. She picked up the receiver, her voice firm: "Thompson, Emerald City Times."
