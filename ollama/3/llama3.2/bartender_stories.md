Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The neon signs of the city's strip district cast a gaudy glow over the rainy streets of downtown, casting long shadows across the wet pavement. Inside the cramped, smoke-filled bar, "Mac's Tavern", the air was thick with the smell of cheap beer and stale cigarettes. Behind the counter, MacKenzie Elizabeth Thompson polished a mug with a dirty rag, her bright pink streaked hair tied back in a ponytail as she surveyed the evening's crowd with a mix of boredom and disdain.

It was 10 PM on a typical Wednesday night, and the usual suspects had all gathered at the bar: a group of rowdy college students celebrating a party weekend gone wrong, a pair of rough-looking bikers nursing their beers in the corner, and a lone figure huddled in the shadows, nursing a whiskey on the rocks. Mac had seen it all before, but tonight felt different - like something was off, like the night held some hidden secret just waiting to be uncovered.

As she slid a plate of stale nachos across the bar to a waiting patron, Mac's eyes flicked towards the stranger in the corner, his face obscured by a hoodie and sunglasses. She couldn't quite make out what he looked like, but there was something about him that caught her attention - maybe it was the way he seemed to be watching everyone with an intensity that bordered on fascination. Whatever it was, Mac felt a shiver run down her spine as she wondered who this stranger was, and what he wanted.
