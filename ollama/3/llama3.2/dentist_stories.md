Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexander "Alex" Thompson wiped the sweat from his forehead as he stepped out of his car and onto the hot pavement outside the office of Smith & Co., Dentistry. It was a sweltering summer evening in August, and the sun was just beginning to set over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets.

As the owner of Thompson Dental Care, Alex had spent the day tending to patients' teeth, from routine cleanings to more complex procedures. He was known for his gentle touch and patient bedside manner, which earned him a loyal following among the town's residents.

Now, as he locked up the office and made his way home, Alex couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been growing inside him all day. It wasn't just the usual stress of running a small business or dealing with the occasional difficult patient - it was something more. Something that had been nagging at him since the morning, when he'd received a mysterious phone call from an unknown number.

The voice on the other end had been low and gravelly, speaking in hushed tones about a "file" that Alex needed to retrieve from an old safe in his office. The caller had hung up before Alex could ask any questions, but the words had stuck with him: "You don't want to know what's inside."

Alex sighed and shook his head, chiding himself for being spooked by a prank call. But as he walked towards his car, he couldn't help but wonder - what if there was more to it than that?
