Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling airport, Flight Attendant Emily Joy Thompson poured herself another cup of lukewarm coffee from the vending machine in the crew room. It was 3:00 AM on a Sunday morning, and the flight was still an hour away from departing, but Emily was wide awake, her mind racing with the weight of what had happened earlier that day.

The airport's fluorescent lights hummed overhead as Emily gazed out the small window of the crew room, watching as the rain-soaked streets below transformed into a slick, mirror-like expanse. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she thought about the news report on her phone - another plane had crashed just an hour ago, and the bodies were still being pulled from the wreckage.

Emily took a deep breath and tried to shake off the unease that had settled in her stomach. She had been flying for over five years now, and she knew better than to let fear get the best of her. But as she turned back to the small table where her belongings lay scattered, her eyes landed on a photo of herself with her family - her husband, Tom, and their two kids, Mia and Jack - and she felt a pang of guilt for not being able to spend more time with them.

With a heavy sigh, Emily pulled out her phone and began to scroll through the news reports, trying to make sense of the chaos unfolding just outside the airport's walls. Little did she know that this was only the beginning of a very long and terrifying flight.
