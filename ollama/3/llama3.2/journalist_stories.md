Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Tokyo were always at their most unforgiving in the early hours of the morning. The neon lights that lined the city's bustling avenues seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy, casting a gaudy glow over the crowded sidewalks. Amidst this chaotic landscape, Emiko Matsumoto stood outside the imposing walls of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, her eyes fixed on the sleek glass fa√ßade of the building.

Emiko, a seasoned investigative journalist for the city's largest newspaper, the Shinpuri Shimbun, had been working tirelessly to uncover the truth behind a string of mysterious disappearances that had shaken the community. As she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time that morning, a shiver ran down her spine - this was supposed to be the day she would finally get answers.

With a deep breath, Emiko pushed open the heavy glass doors and stepped into the sterile world of the police department, ready to face whatever lay ahead. Little did she know, the information she sought would change everything she thought she knew about the city and its people forever.
