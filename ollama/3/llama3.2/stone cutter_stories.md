Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small village of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the thatched roofs and muddy streets. Amidst the bustling activity of the market square, one figure stood out - Emrys ap Rhys, a skilled stone cutter with hands as worn as the ancient stones he worked with.

Emrys, son of Rhys ap Gwyn, had spent his entire life honing his craft in the village quarry, where the harsh granite and basalt formations that dotted the surrounding hills made for some of the finest stone in all the land. With a keen eye and deft touch, he could coax even the most recalcitrant blocks into submission, bringing forth intricate carvings and statues that seemed to spring from the very earth itself.

As he emerged from his small workshop, Emrys took a deep breath of the crisp morning air, feeling the familiar thrill of anticipation. Today was market day - the one day of the week when the villagers would gather to buy and sell the freshest produce, handmade wares, and, of course, the finest stone in all the realm.

But amidst the usual bustle, Emrys couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. A sense of unease had been building in him for weeks, like a slow-moving storm gathering on the horizon. He couldn't quite put his finger on it - perhaps it was the strange dreams he'd been having at night, or the lingering sense of disquiet that lingered long after he woke.

Whatever it was, Emrys knew one thing for certain: he had to get to market early, and make sure his wares were ready for the demanding customers who would soon be flooding the square. Little did he know, however, that this would prove to be only the beginning of a most eventful day...
