The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and desperation. Amelia "Amy" Hayes surveyed the room, her eyes flitting across the pale walls plastered with motivational posters featuring impossibly chiseled athletes defying gravity. A steady rhythm of whirs and clicks emanated from the array of equipment lining one wall – the familiar symphony of pain and progress in Amy's world. 

She worked at Sunrise Rehabilitation Center, a sprawling, nondescript building on the outskirts of Asheville, North Carolina.  The mountains loomed outside the windows, perpetually veiled in mist, mirroring the melancholic mood that often settled over patients like a shroud. Today was no different. Amy had just finished helping Mr. Henderson regain some dexterity in his left hand after his stroke, and now she was bracing herself for her next appointment – a young woman named Lily who'd been brought in with a shattered leg following a tragic mountain biking accident. 

As Lily shuffled into the room, supported by a cumbersome crutch, Amy felt a familiar pang of empathy.  Lily's face was pale, etched with pain and resignation, but her eyes held a flicker of defiance that sparked something within Amy – a quiet determination to help her find strength again, even in the face of unimaginable adversity.
