The air hung heavy with the scent of hay and manure, a fragrance Amelia Thistlewick found oddly comforting. Dawn was just breaking over Meadowbrook Sanctuary, casting long shadows across the dew-kissed pastures where a dozen rescued horses grazed peacefully.  Amelia, her worn boots crunching on the gravel path, stretched her arms towards the pale sunrise, a quiet sigh escaping her lips. Her heart felt full, even before the first rooster crow announced the start of another day. 

This sanctuary was Amelia's lifeblood. A haven for abused and neglected animals, it pulsed with a constant hum of activity: gentle whinnies from rescued ponies, the insistent meows of cats yearning for attention, and the soft chirps of recovering birds nestled in their makeshift nests.  For Amelia, there was no greater satisfaction than easing their suffering, tending to their wounds, and whispering words of comfort into ears that had known only harshness.
