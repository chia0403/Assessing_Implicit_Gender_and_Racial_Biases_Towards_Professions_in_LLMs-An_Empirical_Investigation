The air hung thick with the scent of iron and brine in Bartholomew "Bart" Butchers' shop.  Sunlight filtered through the grimy windowpanes, casting long shadows across the glistening steel cleavers resting on the worn counter. Outside, the cobbled streets of Grimsborough were bustling with the rhythm of a Tuesday morning – hawkers calling out their wares, children chasing stray cats, and carriages rumbling along the rutted path. But within Bart's haven, time seemed to move differently, dictated by the steady thump of his cleaver against bone and the rhythmic rasp of the meat grinder. 

Bart, a man whose broad shoulders could rival a ox and whose face bore the permanent crease of a perpetual frown, was meticulously dissecting a boar, its plump haunches draped over the butcher's block like fallen giants. A thin film of sweat clung to his brow as he worked, the effort etched in the lines around his eyes. His movements were practiced, economical – each slice precise, each chop efficient. He knew every curve and contour of the animal, every hidden muscle and sinew. To Bart, this wasn't just meat; it was a story whispered in flesh and bone, a testament to life and death, beauty and brutality. 


He paused, his cleaver suspended mid-air, as the bell above the door chimed, announcing another customer. He wiped his hands on his apron, steeling himself for whatever tale the Grimsborough morning would bring.
