The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Rose Blackwood, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sterile white walls of the clinic. It was always the same: the scent of antiseptic clinging to the air, the gentle whirring of the centrifuge in the corner, and the steady drip-drip-drip of saline solution from an IV pole.  

Amelia had been a phlebotomist at Mercy General for five years, long enough to know every creak of the floorboards, every cough echoing down the hallway, every patient’s nervous tic before they even drew their first breath in her presence. She was a master of her craft, extracting blood with the precision of a surgeon and the calm demeanor of a meditation teacher. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine, like a stray electrical wire shorting out. 

Maybe it was the woman waiting at her station, staring at Amelia with eyes that seemed to hold an ancient sadness, her thin lips pulled tight into a tense line. Or maybe it was the way the air felt suddenly charged, thick and heavy, as if the clinic itself were holding its breath. Whatever the reason, Amelia knew this wouldn’t be just another routine blood draw.
