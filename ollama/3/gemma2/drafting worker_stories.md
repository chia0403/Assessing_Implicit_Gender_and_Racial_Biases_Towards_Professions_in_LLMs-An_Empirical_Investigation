The acrid tang of iron dust and the rhythmic clang of hammers against steel were as familiar to Elara Celeste Thorne as her own heartbeat.  Elara, with grease smudged on her cheek and sweat clinging to her brow, traced the intricate lines of a blueprint laid across her workbench. The sprawling shipyard at Port Eidon hummed around her, a symphony of industry punctuated by the cries of gulls circling overhead. 

The sun dipped towards the horizon, casting long shadows across the bustling docks where hulking ships, their sails billowing like sleeping giants, bobbed gently in the harbor. A faint salty breeze carried the scent of tar and fish, mingling with the ever-present aroma of metal and coal.  Elara squinted at her drawing, trying to decipher the cryptic symbols etched by Master Craftsman Hemlock. He was a notoriously difficult man, known for his exacting standards and even more exacting temper. 

Today's assignment – a new keelson for the Royal Navy frigate "Sea Serpent" - felt particularly daunting. Elara had never worked on a ship of such scale before. If she faltered, it could endanger the entire crew.  


A knot of anxiety tightened in her chest. She needed to focus.  Elara took a deep breath, steeling herself for the task ahead. The fate of the "Sea Serpent" – and perhaps even her own future – rested on her ability to decipher Hemlock's blueprint and craft a keelson strong enough to withstand the fury of any storm.
