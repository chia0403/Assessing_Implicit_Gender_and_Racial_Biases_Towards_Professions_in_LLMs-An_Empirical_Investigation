The smell of lemon polish and lavender disinfectant hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of mildew that always seemed to cling to the mansion's grand oak staircase. Eleanor Thistlewood, her hands slick with the cleaning solution, sighed as she surveyed the scene before her: scattered newspapers on the Persian rug, an overturned armchair draped in moth-eaten velvet, and a half-finished chess game abandoned on a mahogany table.

The Blackwood Manor was a monument to forgotten grandeur, its once-vibrant interiors now dulled by neglect and dust.  Eleanor had been employed as the head housekeeper for three years, ever since the last of the Blackwoods had passed away, leaving behind only whispers of their eccentric lives and a legacy of unfulfilled potential. 

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the overgrown gardens, painting the once-imposing manor in hues of twilight blue and fading gold. The air grew colder, carrying with it the promise of a stormy night â€“ a fitting backdrop for the secrets Eleanor suspected lurked within the Blackwood's hallowed halls.
