The sticky fingerprints smeared across the "Welcome" banner hung like melancholic rainbows. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne sighed, adjusting her brightly coloured cardigan – a necessity in this chaotic rainbow land called "Sunshine Daycare."  

Outside, the summer sun beat down relentlessly on the playground, turning the rubber mulch into a shimmering mirage. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of peanut butter crackers and impending meltdowns. Eleanor surveyed the scene: toddlers teetering precariously on miniature rocking horses, a chorus of unintelligible babble rising from the building blocks corner, and little Tommy Patterson, his face contorted in an expression of pure concentration as he attempted to fit a rectangular block into a round hole. This was her life – a whirlwind of sticky hands, juice spills, and endless, heartwarming chaos.  



Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Eleanor's spine, a sense that the usual rhythm of Sunshine Daycare was about to be disrupted. Perhaps it was the unusually quiet demeanor of Mrs. Jenkins, the perpetually cheerful head cook, or maybe it was the way the light seemed to slant through the windows, casting long, unsettling shadows on the brightly coloured walls. Whatever it was, Eleanor felt a knot tightening in her stomach. This day, she suspected, was going to be anything but ordinary.
