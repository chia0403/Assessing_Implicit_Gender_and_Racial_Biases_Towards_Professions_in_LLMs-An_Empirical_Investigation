The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt copper, a familiar aroma to Dr. Amelia Evelyn Hawthorne, even after years of working in this clandestine facility hidden beneath the Nevada desert. 

Her boots crunched on shards of blackened metal as she navigated the wreckage of Experiment Gamma-7. The containment field had failed spectacularly, unleashing whatever it was they'd unearthed from the Siberian permafrost onto the world. Now, twisted metal skeletons and scorched earth marked the site where hope for a breakthrough in energy research had gone up in smoke.  

Amelia knelt beside a mangled piece of equipment, its internal circuitry exposed like the fragile wiring of a dissected brain. She traced the burn marks with a gloved finger, her mind racing through the possibilities. What had they unleashed? Was it sentient? How could they have prevented this catastrophic failure? 


The setting: A heavily fortified research facility buried deep beneath the Nevada desert. The facility is dedicated to studying and harnessing unusual energy sources, often unearthed from remote locations around the globe. The atmosphere is tense and secretive, with a palpable sense of danger lurking just beneath the surface.
