The rain hammered against Officer Elara Vance's windshield, blurring the neon signs of downtown Oakland into a kaleidoscope of color. It wasn't the kind of weather that made people want to cooperate.  

Elara sighed, tapping her fingers on the steering wheel in a restless rhythm. Her office was three blocks from here, but she'd opted for this drive, this familiar circuit through the grimy underbelly of the city, hoping it would clear her head. She had a particularly difficult client waiting for her: Michael "Mickey" Reyes, fresh out of juvenile detention and already on his second probation violation.  

Elara hated these visits. They always felt like walking into a pressure cooker, each word carrying the weight of judgment, expectation, and fear. Mickey's past was a tapestry woven with petty theft, defiance, and an unsettling streak of violence. She knew this meeting could go south in an instant, but duty called. Elara adjusted her blazer, pulled up her collar against the damp chill, and stepped out into the storm.
