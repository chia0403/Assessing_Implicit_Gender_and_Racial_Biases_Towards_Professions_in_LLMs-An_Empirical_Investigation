The clatter of rain against the windowpanes was the only sound in Eleanor Amelia Finch’s otherwise silent office. Outside, Manchester blurred into a watercolour wash of greys and greens. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and impending deadlines. 

Eleanor, her emerald green cardigan pulled tight against the chill creeping in from the drafty windows, stared at the mountain of files on her desk. Each one held a story, a life, a moment frozen in time – divorce settlements, property disputes, legal battles fought in hushed tones within these very walls. But Eleanor saw them as more than just paperwork; she saw them as fragments of human experience, each one whispering its secrets to the attentive ear. 

As managing secretary for Finch & Sons Solicitors, she had become a silent witness to the triumphs and tragedies that played out in the lives of their clients. She knew the rhythm of their anxieties, the cadence of their hopes, the weight of their regrets.  Today, however, felt different. A gnawing unease settled in her stomach, a premonition that something was about to shift. The air crackled with anticipation, charged with an energy she couldn't quite place. 


Eleanor took a deep breath, pushing aside the unsettling feeling. She had files to sort, calls to make, and a mountain of paperwork to conquer.  There was no time for idle speculation. Or perhaps, there wasn’t any time not to speculate. Whatever it was, she knew it would be waiting for her when the morning sun finally pierced through the gloom.
