The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the worn linoleum floor. Rosemary Juniper pressed her lips together, stifling another yawn. The clock on the wall blinked 8:02 AM, and already, the waiting room held the first two weary souls of the day â€“ a frazzled-looking mother with a screaming toddler in tow, and a man slumped over a briefcase, his face buried in a crumpled newspaper.

Rosemary sighed, glancing at her reflection in the glass partition. Her name tag proclaimed "Rosemary Juniper, Receptionist," in bold, plastic letters. A cruel joke, considering how little reception involved these days. More often than not, it felt like she was drowning in paperwork and dodging disgruntled clients while simultaneously playing referee to their outlandish disputes.

Just then, the shrill ring of the phone pierced through the quiet hum. Rosemary braced herself, knowing that whatever catastrophe awaited on the other end would undoubtedly be a personal attack on her already dwindling patience.
