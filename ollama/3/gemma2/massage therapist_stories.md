The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a comforting cloak woven around Amelia Clementine's small sanctuary. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the world outside into a watercolour wash of grey and green. Inside, the warm glow of fairy lights danced across the polished wooden floor, casting long shadows from the potted ferns lining the walls.

Amelia knelt beside her massage table, adjusting the soft fleece blanket with gentle fingers. Her own hands were familiar with the language of touch – the soothing glide over tense muscles, the deep kneading that released knots of stress, the feather-light strokes that calmed a frazzled mind. A symphony of creaks and groans emanated from the old Victorian house as it sighed under the onslaught of the storm.  

But Amelia didn't mind the sound. It was a familiar lullaby, a soundtrack to her work, a reminder that she was a safe haven in a world increasingly prone to chaos. And tonight, she knew, someone needed that haven more than ever. The rhythmic tapping on the door announced her next client's arrival – a man shrouded in shadows and carrying the weight of unspoken anxieties.
