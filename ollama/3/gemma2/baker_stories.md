The air in Amelia Rose Butterfield's bakery hung thick with the scent of caramelized sugar and warm yeast. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating swirling patterns in the flour dusted across her counter. Outside, Edinburgh was waking up, the rumble of buses and the distant chatter of vendors already beginning to fill the cobbled streets. Inside, however, time moved at a slower pace, dictated by the gentle rise of dough and the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock hanging above the stove. Amelia hummed softly, her hands deftly kneading a batch of sourdough, her movements as practiced and familiar as breathing.  It was almost opening time, and her shelves were already laden with pastries â€“ plump scones, glistening croissants, and delicate tarts bursting with seasonal fruit. It was always the same symphony of flour, sugar, and butter, but for Amelia, there was magic in the mundane. Every loaf baked, every croissant flaked, was a small masterpiece, a testament to the simple joy of creation.  


Today, however, felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced beneath her skin, a sense that something was about to change. It was more than just the usual buzz of a busy Saturday morning; it felt like the universe was nudging her towards something new, something exciting.
