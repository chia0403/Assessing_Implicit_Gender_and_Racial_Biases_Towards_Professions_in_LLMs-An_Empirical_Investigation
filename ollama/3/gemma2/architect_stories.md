The wind whipped around Alistair Finch's ankles, carrying with it the scent of salt and freshly turned earth. He stood on the precipice of the cliff, the Irish Sea churning violently below. This wasn't just any view; this was his canvas. The craggy coastline, dotted with weathered cottages and ancient stone forts, stretched before him like a forgotten dream.  

Alistair, a rising star in the architectural world known for his innovative, eco-friendly designs, had been drawn to this desolate stretch of land by a whisper â€“ a rumor about a hidden cove, untouched by modern progress, where legend claimed a magical light danced on moonlit nights. He was here to build a lighthouse, not just a beacon for ships lost at sea, but a sanctuary, a refuge from the relentless pace of life. A place where nature and architecture could merge in perfect harmony.


This rugged landscape, with its dramatic contrasts of sky and sea, solitude and whispers of ancient magic, felt like the only place Alistair could truly breathe.
