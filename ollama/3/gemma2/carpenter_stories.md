The air in Elias Thornewood’s workshop hung thick with sawdust and the scent of fresh pine. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the golden haze. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, ran a calloused thumb over the intricate dovetail joint he was crafting.  

He worked in an old Victorian house on the outskirts of Fairhaven, a town steeped in maritime history and shrouded in whispers of forgotten secrets. The sea pressed against the shore just beyond the overgrown garden, its rhythmic crashing a constant soundtrack to Elias's work. He’d inherited the house from his grandfather, a renowned shipwright who had instilled in him a love for wood and its stories. Each piece held within it the echoes of forests long gone, the weight of hands that had shaped it before him, the promise of something new yet to be built. 

Today, Elias was working on a commission unlike any he'd ever undertaken: a life-sized replica of a ship named "The Siren's Song," rumored to have vanished without a trace decades ago.  As he carefully measured and cut the mahogany planks, he couldn’t shake the feeling that this project held more than just carpentry at its heart. It felt like a key, unlocking secrets buried deep within the town’s past.
