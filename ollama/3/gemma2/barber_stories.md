The rhythmic whir of clippers against hair filled the air, punctuated by the occasional sigh of contentment from Mr. Bartholomew "Bart" Finnegan's chair.  The barbershop was bathed in the warm glow of afternoon sun streaming through the dusty windowpanes, casting long shadows that danced across the worn linoleum floor. The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy, a familiar comfort to regulars like old Mrs. Peterson, who sat knitting in the corner, and young Tommy Henderson, who nervously fidgeted in his seat, waiting for his first proper haircut. 

Bart himself was a man of routine. He meticulously wiped down each comb and scissor before use, humming a jaunty tune under his breath as he worked. His thick, greying hair was always perfectly sculpted, mirroring the sharp edges he crafted on his customers' heads.  A lifetime spent in this cramped space had honed him into a master craftsman, his hands moving with practiced precision. But today, Bart felt a prickle of unease beneath the usual humdrum. Something about the afternoon light seemed different, and the silence between haircuts felt heavier than usual. He couldn't quite place it, but a sense of anticipation, like the hush before a storm, settled over him.
