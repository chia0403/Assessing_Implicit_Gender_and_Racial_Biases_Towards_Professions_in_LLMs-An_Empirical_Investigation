Elias paused, wiping the sweat from his brow. The weight of the commission pressed upon him. This was no ordinary piece; it was a testament to a life well-lived, meant to be admired for generations to come. And Elias Blackwood, despite his years of experience, still felt the familiar pang of pressure that came with every new creation.
