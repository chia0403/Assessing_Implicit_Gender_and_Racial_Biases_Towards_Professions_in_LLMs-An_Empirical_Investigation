The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain.  Lightning flickered across the bruised sky, casting an eerie, strobing light on the ramshackle farmhouse in front of him. A chill snaked down Elias Blackwood's spine despite the oppressive heat, a feeling he knew had nothing to do with the storm brewing overhead. He adjusted his tool belt, the weight familiar and comforting against his hips. This wasn't just any call; this was Widow Thompson's place, on the edge of town, known by locals as "The Crow House" for the perpetual flock that seemed to roost there even in broad daylight. 


Elias took a deep breath and stepped onto the porch, its wooden planks groaning under his weight. The air here was still and silent, an unsettling contrast to the raging storm just beyond. He could hear a faint humming sound emanating from within, like a low-frequency lullaby. 

He raised his hand and knocked, but the only response was the rhythmic clatter of rain against the tin roof. With a shrug, Elias pushed open the creaking door and stepped into darkness. The air inside was thick with dust and the scent of mildew, and an unsettling feeling of being watched settled over him. He flicked on his flashlight, its beam slicing through the gloom, revealing a dusty living room filled with shrouded furniture and cobwebs draped like macabre curtains. 


He felt a shiver run down his spine. This wasn't just a simple electrical issue. Something was off here, something deeply unsettling.
