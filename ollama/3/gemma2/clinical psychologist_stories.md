The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser against the glass. It mirrored the storm brewing within her own mind, a tempest of frustration and exhaustion. She leaned back in her ergonomic chair, fingers drumming a restless tattoo on the armrest. Another session cancelled. Another day lost to the labyrinthine complexities of the human psyche.

Eleanor’s office was nestled in a quiet corner of Beacon Hill, a haven from the urban chaos just beyond its doors. Sunlight barely penetrated the perpetually overcast skies of Boston, casting the space in a muted, contemplative gloom. The walls were adorned with calming abstract paintings – soothing blues and greens that did little to quell the unease gnawing at her. A half-finished cup of chamomile tea sat cold on her desk, a testament to her inability to focus even on the simplest of tasks.


It was days like these that Eleanor questioned her choice of profession.  The responsibility felt immense – carrying the weight of others' anxieties, fears, and traumas on her shoulders. Sometimes, she longed for a simpler life, one where the only storms were meteorological, not emotional. But then, a glimmer of hope would pierce through the gloom - a breakthrough moment with a patient, a flicker of understanding in their eyes, and she'd be reminded why she dedicated herself to this path.  


A faint chime from her desk phone jolted her back to reality. A new name flashed on the screen: "John Davies."
