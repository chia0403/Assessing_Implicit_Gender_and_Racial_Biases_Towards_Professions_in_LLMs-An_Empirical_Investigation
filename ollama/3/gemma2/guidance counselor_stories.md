The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Claire Beaumont's head like a chorus of anxious cicadas.  Each buzz seemed to echo the unease bubbling in her own stomach. This wasn't just another day at Westview High. Today was Senior Day, and with it came the bittersweet weight of watching hundreds of dreams take flight – or crash and burn. 

Amelia surveyed her office, a haven of mismatched armchairs, motivational posters faded by years of teenage angst, and stacks of college brochures threatening to topple over like Jenga towers. Outside, the sun beat down on the asphalt playground, turning it into a shimmering mirage of summer's promise. But inside, Amelia felt a chill. This year, there was something different in the air. A palpable tension thrummed beneath the usual chaos of last-minute anxieties and graduation jitters.  

Perhaps it was the way the students seemed more subdued than usual, their laughter lacking its usual spark. Or maybe it was the shadow cast by recent news reports – whispers of a prestigious university rescinding acceptance offers due to an unforeseen scandal. Whatever the cause, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just another Senior Day. It was the start of something… unsettling.
