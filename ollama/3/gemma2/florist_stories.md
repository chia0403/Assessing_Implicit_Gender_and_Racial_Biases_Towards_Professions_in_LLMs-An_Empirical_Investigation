The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, a sweet, cloying perfume that clung to Eloise Rosemary Thistlewood's clothes like a second skin.  She inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar aroma as she arranged a cascade of white blooms into a vase. Sunbeams sliced through the dusty panes of her shop window, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the overflowing buckets of vibrant chrysanthemums and velvety roses. 

Eloise's "Blooming Hearts" was tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in Edinburgh, its cheerful yellow facade a beacon of color amidst the gray sandstone buildings that lined the lane. She knew her neighborhood like the back of her hand: the worn steps leading to Mrs. MacDougall's flat above the bakery, the perpetually muddy patch outside Mr. McGregor's antique shop, and the cheeky grin of young Jamie who always ran past with his dog, a scruffy terrier named Winston.  

But today was different. A tremor of anxiety buzzed beneath Eloise’s skin. It wasn't the usual pre-wedding day rush or the pressure to create the perfect arrangement for Mrs. Henderson’s grand birthday celebration. Today, a stranger had walked into her shop – a man with eyes as dark and mysterious as a Scottish loch, seeking flowers for… himself.
