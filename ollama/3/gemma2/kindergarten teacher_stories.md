The bell above Ms. Eleanor Rosalind Finch's classroom door chimed merrily as the last of her students tumbled in, their backpacks bouncing and tiny voices vying for attention.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, painting squares of warmth on the colorful rug where a mismatched collection of stuffed animals lay scattered amongst building blocks. 

Eleanor surveyed the scene with a smile, adjusting her own bright red headband that matched the ladybug earrings adorning her ears. This was her kingdom – a chaotic, messy, infinitely joyful world of finger paints, singalongs, and stories whispered under rainbow-striped blankets. 


Her kingdom, for all its wonder, had become a little too quiet lately.  One by one, whispers had started circulating amongst the parents - unsettling rumors about strange occurrences in the nearby woods. Strange lights, unnatural sounds, even sightings of something… otherworldly.

Eleanor, however, refused to let fear creep into her haven. She'd faced down meltdowns over missing crayons and battles over sharing more formidable enemies than any woodland creature. This wouldn't be any different.
