The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and ozone, a familiar perfume in Bartholomew “Barty” Finnegan’s world. Grease smeared his forearms like camouflage, testament to another day spent wrestling with the mechanical beasts that cluttered his garage. Sunlight slanted through dusty windows, illuminating motes of grime dancing in the air. The rhythmic clang of Barty’s hammer echoed off the worn metal shelves stacked high with tools and salvaged car parts. A radio tuned to a local classic rock station crackled softly in the background, its tune competing with the constant hum of machinery and the occasional hiss of escaping steam. 

Barty wiped his brow with a greasy rag, leaving a smudge across his salt-and-pepper stubble. This wasn't just any garage; it was Barty’s legacy, inherited from his grandfather who had poured his heart and soul into this space. Now, years later, the worn floorboards creaked under Barty's weight as he moved between the various projects, each one a puzzle demanding his attention, a mechanical symphony waiting for him to conduct its final note.  He wasn't just fixing cars; he was breathing life back into them, restoring their forgotten roar and spirit. 


This was his haven, a sanctuary from the complexities of life beyond these four walls. And right now, with a stubborn carburetor refusing to cooperate, Barty found himself lost in the familiar rhythm of his work, the satisfying click of wrenches, the whir of drills, and the soft hum of an engine slowly coming back to life.
