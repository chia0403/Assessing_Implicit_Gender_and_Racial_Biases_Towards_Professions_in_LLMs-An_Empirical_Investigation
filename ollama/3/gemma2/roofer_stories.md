The morning sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Grace's neck, turning her skin hot even through the thin cotton of her work shirt. She squinted at the two-story Victorian house before her, its slate roof shimmering like a giant sapphire in the summer heat. The air hummed with the drone of cicadas and the distant rumble of traffic on Elm Street. Amy wiped sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand, grumbling about the oppressive August weather as she hoisted another bundle of shingles onto her shoulder. This was going to be a long day. 


The house itself was a beautiful beast, its gingerbread trim delicate against the dark wood siding. Amy loved these old houses, each one a unique puzzle with hidden stories whispered in their warped floorboards and faded wallpaper. The current owners, a young couple with two rambunctious golden retrievers, had decided to replace the entire roof after discovering a suspicious leak during a spring rainstorm. It was a job that would take Amy at least two full days, maybe three if she ran into any unexpected surprises.
