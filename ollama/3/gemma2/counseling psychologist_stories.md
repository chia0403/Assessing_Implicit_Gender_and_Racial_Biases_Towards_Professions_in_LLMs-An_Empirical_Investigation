The rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's window, mimicking the relentless drumbeat of anxiety gnawing at her own insides. Her cozy office, usually bathed in warm sunlight filtering through sheer curtains, was shrouded in an almost tangible gloom. Rain had been falling for days, turning the vibrant autumn leaves into soggy puddles and casting a melancholic hue over the entire city. Amelia sighed, pushing aside the stack of files threatening to engulf her desk. Today felt different, heavier than usual. Perhaps it was the oppressive weather, or maybe it was the string of particularly difficult cases she'd been handling lately. 

It was always challenging being a counseling psychologist, navigating the labyrinthine pathways of the human psyche. But today, a sense of unease settled over her like a shroud, whispering a warning she couldn't quite decipher. The next patient due in, Ms. Evelyn Wright, had requested an emergency session. Amelia ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, hoping for a clear mind as she prepped for the encounter. 


**Setting:**  A cozy, book-lined counseling office overlooking a bustling city street. Autumn has arrived, painting the cityscape in hues of gold and crimson, but the persistent rain casts a somber tone. The air inside is warm and fragrant with cinnamon and clove, a desperate attempt to combat the encroaching gloom.
