The Grand Astoria Hotel was built on secrets. Not scandalous ones, mind you, but the quiet, unspoken histories woven into its plush carpets and gilded railings. For Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Davenport, concierge extraordinaire, these secrets were her bread and butter. She knew when Mrs. Hathaway preferred Earl Grey with a sliver of lemon, Mr. Jones always requested a single red rose on his birthday (even though he claimed to hate flowers), and that the new couple in Suite 304 were actually running from an arranged marriage back in India.

Amy thrived in this world of discreet observations and fulfilled desires.  The grand foyer was her stage, its polished marble reflecting the soft glow of the crystal chandeliers like a thousand scattered stars. Guests with faces both familiar and foreign flowed through, each carrying their own tale, their own need for something… Amelia could be their guide, their confidante, their secret keeper. 

But tonight, the air crackled with an unfamiliar tension.  A guest had arrived who didn't seem to fit into any of her carefully constructed categories. A man cloaked in shadows, his eyes like polished obsidian, he exuded a quiet danger that set Amy’s finely tuned senses on high alert. 


He requested room 1308 – the attic suite, rarely occupied, with its breathtaking view of the city and its whispered tales of paranormal activity.  

As Amy handed him the key, she knew this guest wouldn't just be another story in her repertoire. This man was a puzzle waiting to be solved, a mystery that threatened to unravel everything she thought she knew about the Grand Astoria Hotel.
