The acrid scent of smoke clung to Amelia "Amy" Blackwood like a second skin. It wasn't unusual for her; it was the perfume of her life, woven into the fabric of her days as a firefighter with Engine 31 in Chicago's West Loop.  

The midday sun beat down on the grey brick buildings lining Randolph Street, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across cracked sidewalks and overflowing dumpsters. The usual lunchtime buzz of the neighborhood had been replaced by an unsettling silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic clang of a nearby construction site. 

Amy sat perched on her engine's hood, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and scanning the street with practiced eyes. Engine 31 was the closest unit to the source of the commotion - a plume of black smoke billowing from a five-story apartment building just two blocks away. Her gut twisted; it wasn't a normal chimney fire. This one felt different, heavier, more menacing. She took a deep breath, the scent of coffee battling with the ever-present tang of burnt wood and something elseâ€¦something acrid and unfamiliar.

It was time to go to work.
