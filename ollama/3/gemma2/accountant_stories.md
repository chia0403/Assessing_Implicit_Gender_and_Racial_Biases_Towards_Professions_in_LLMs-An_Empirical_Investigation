The fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Thorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the spreadsheets that sprawled across his desk like an unending forest. Outside his window, the city was a symphony of honking horns and distant sirens, a jarring contrast to the rhythmic clacking of his keyboard as he diligently balanced figures. Elias, with his meticulously parted hair and tie always perfectly knotted, was a creature of order amidst the chaotic world outside.  

His office, tucked away on the 17th floor of a nondescript grey building in Manhattan, was a testament to this love for structure. Every item had its place – the stapler nestled neatly beside the calculator, his favorite mug positioned precisely at the edge of the desk, and an antique globe (a gift from his grandfather) reminding him that even amidst numbers, there was a vast world beyond balance sheets.  

Elias wasn't unhappy; he simply existed in a state of comfortable routine. But tonight, as he worked late on a particularly complex merger for a tech startup, something shifted. A phone call, a hushed voice, and a cryptic message – "They know" – shattered the calm of his world. Elias Thorne, the meticulous accountant, felt a shiver run down his spine.  The balance sheet in front of him suddenly seemed less important than the unknown weight pressing down on him.
