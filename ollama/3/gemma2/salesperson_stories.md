The neon sign buzzed, casting an anemic purple light across Eleanor Ophelia Vance's face as she surveyed the cluttered shelves of "Gadgets & Gizmos."  A lone fly buzzed lazily around a dusty ceramic robot figurine, its antennae twitching like nervous whiskers. The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt solder and desperation. 

Eleanor, or Ellie as her dwindling clientele called her, adjusted the collar of her ill-fitting sales uniform – a faded green polyester monstrosity that seemed to absorb every ounce of optimism in the room. She'd been at Gadgets & Gizmos for five years, selling increasingly irrelevant contraptions to an increasingly apathetic public. 


It wasn't always like this. Once, Ellie had dreamt of revolutionizing the world with innovative gadgets – flying scooters, self-cleaning toilets, maybe even a teleportation device or two. But reality, like a faulty circuit board, had shorted out her dreams. Now, she was left selling "Talking Teapots" that spat pre-recorded insults and "Self-Stirring Spoons" that seemed to stir only in the direction of potential disaster.
