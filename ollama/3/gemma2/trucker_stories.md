The sun bled across the horizon, painting the endless rows of cornfields with streaks of burnt orange and bruised purple. A thin layer of mist hung in the air, clinging to the chrome grill of Bartholomew "Bart" Jackson's Peterbilt like morning breath. He squinted through the windshield, his gaze fixed on the highway ribboning ahead - a black vein pulsing through the heartland. 

Bart took a long swig from his coffee thermos, the bitter brew doing little to banish the weariness that settled deep in his bones. Eighteen hours behind the wheel had worn him down like sandpaper on steel, but there was no stopping now. His cargo – a refrigerated trailer filled with precious mangoes destined for a Miami supermarket – demanded constant vigilance.  

He nudged the engine into gear, the diesel purring to life with a familiar rumble. The Peterbilt shuddered, then lurched forward, swallowing the sunrise and leaving behind the fading echoes of farm country. Ahead lay another day on Route 66, another leg in Bart's journey across America, each mile a testament to his dedication, loneliness, and unwavering love for the open road.
