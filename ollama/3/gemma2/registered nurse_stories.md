The air in the Emergency Room was thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, RN, ran a hand through her damp hair, feeling the familiar tremor that always accompanied a Code Blue. The rhythmic beep of monitors mingled with the hurried whispers of doctors and nurses, creating a symphony of chaos that only those who walked this path understood. 

Amelia's gaze landed on the young boy sprawled across the gurney, his chest rising and falling in shallow gasps. He was pale as moonlight, his normally vibrant blue eyes now glazed with pain.  His name was Ethan Carter, just eight years old, brought in after a fall from a tree while playing in the park with his friends. 

The ER was a battlefield tonight, but Amelia had seen worse. Still, a knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach. This wasn't just another injury; there was a fragility about Ethan that resonated with Amelia on a primal level. He looked so small and vulnerable, a fragile butterfly caught in the storm. 


Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the fight ahead. She had to focus. Ethan needed her now more than ever.
