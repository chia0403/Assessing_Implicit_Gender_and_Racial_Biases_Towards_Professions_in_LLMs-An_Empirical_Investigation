The pungent aroma of sewer gas hung heavy in the air, clinging to Arthur Bartholomew Plumber III like a second skin. He stood on the rickety porch of Mrs. Grimshaw's Victorian mansion, his calloused hands gripping his toolbox with grim determination. Rain lashed down, each drop exploding against the cobblestones like tiny bursts of fury. The wind howled through the ancient oaks lining the street, their branches clawing at the sky as if pleading for mercy.

Arthur, a man forged from years of wrestling stubborn pipes and battling leaky faucets, felt a flicker of unease. This job wasn't just about unclogging a drain; it was about facing something older, darker than the grime he typically encountered. Mrs. Grimshaw had insisted, her voice trembling with an unsettling fervor, that "something evil" was lurking in the depths of her plumbing, feeding on the life force of her beloved home. Arthur, a man of science and logic, scoffed at such notions, yet the sheer desperation in her eyes pricked at his conscience. He stepped off the porch, into the storm, ready to plumb the depths of Mrs. Grimshaw's nightmare.
