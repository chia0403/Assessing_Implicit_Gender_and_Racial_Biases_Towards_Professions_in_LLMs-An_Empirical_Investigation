Rain lashed against Detective Isabella “Izzy” Flores’ windshield, blurring the neon lights of the city into psychedelic streaks.  A thin mist hung heavy in the air, clinging to the gritty streets of New Orleans like a shroud. The humid night pulsed with the muffled thrum of jazz spilling from bars and the distant wail of sirens. Izzy, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather. 

She was headed for the French Quarter, to a scene that promised to be more complex than a simple domestic dispute. The call had been vague: “Man down,” whispered with an urgency that sent chills down Izzy’s spine even through the static of the radio.  Her gut told her this wouldn't just be another night in the Big Easy.
