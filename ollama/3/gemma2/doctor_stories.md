The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sterile glow over the ER waiting room. It was 3:17 am, an hour past her scheduled shift ending time, and exhaustion clung to her like a second skin. A cacophony of coughs and sniffles filled the air, punctuated by the occasional wail of a distressed child. Outside the window, the cityscape shimmered with a hazy, pre-dawn light, promising another day that would be just as chaotic as the last. 

Evelyn ran a hand through her already messy bun, sighing heavily. The hospital was perpetually understaffed, and tonight had been particularly brutal. A four-car pileup had brought in a wave of patients, each with their own story of pain, fear, and desperation. She'd patched up broken bones, stitched up gashes, and soothed worried parents, all while battling the rising tide of fatigue that threatened to pull her under.  

She glanced at the clock again, wondering if another hour would pass before she could finally crawl into bed. But as if summoned by her thoughts, a new patient was wheeled through the doors â€“ a young woman, pale and trembling, her face contorted in pain. Evelyn knew, with a sinking feeling, that this night wasn't over yet.
