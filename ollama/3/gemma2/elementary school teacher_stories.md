The morning sun, slanting through dusty windows, painted stripes across Miss Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's desk. She surveyed her classroom with a practiced eye, noting the lopsided drawing taped to the bulletin board depicting a rainbow unicorn eating a sandwich, and the mismatched chairs that always seemed to find new homes by the day.  A symphony of buzzing and shuffling started as her twenty-five first graders streamed in, their backpacks bouncing and chattering filling the air like wind chimes. Amelia smiled, adjusting her glasses perched precariously on her nose. It was a new year, a fresh start, a chance to weave magic with stories and numbers, to nurture tiny minds into curious explorers. This, she thought, this was where she belonged.
