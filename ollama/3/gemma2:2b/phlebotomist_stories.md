The air in St. Anthony’s Hospital was thick with the smell of disinfectant and stale coffee.  A faint buzz from the IV machines seemed to be perpetually humming on some low-frequency level, barely noticeable above the usual white noise of the waiting room. But this wasn't just any hospital. This was where hope went to die a little more slowly, where dreams were squeezed into tiny vials of fear.  That’s where Elara “Ellie” Blackwood’s heart lay. 

Her hands, so accustomed to deftly maneuvering sterile needles and drawing blood samples, felt heavy today. The weight wasn't just the responsibility that came with being a phlebotomist in a place like St. Anthony’s – it was something heavier, something more personal.  Ellie hadn’t come into this line of work out of some grand sense of duty or noble calling. No, she’d been driven by the same desperation and fear that consumed so many of her patients. Her own mother's illness had pushed her towards a world where even the faintest hope seemed like a flicker in a storm.  

She stared at the waiting room's door as she checked the time, its peeling paint barely contrasting with the vibrant blue scrubs that clung to her form. There was a knock on the glass of the door, and she looked up. The face looking back at her was young and innocent, but the pleading in his eyes was something Ellie had seen a million times before: fear etched into a child's brow.  It was just another patient, another story waiting to be told. But this time, it felt like a personal stake in some bigger game that she wasn't sure how to play.
