The midday sun hammered down on Elias Thorne's weathered shoulders as he knelt beside his worktable. Dust motes danced in the hazy air, illuminated by the glint of granite chips scattered amongst the meticulously arranged blocks. He wasn’t a man easily moved by wind or water, but the relentless heat was starting to wear on him. Years of carving at this quarry had left its own mark on Elias – deep lines etched into his face and hands that were raw from countless hours spent in close contact with the cold stone. 

His workshop was nestled within the heart of the ancient mountain range, a hidden valley carved out by centuries of rain and wind. Here, amidst the jagged peaks and silent waterfalls, stood the imposing silhouette of the Mountain King’s Quarry. Elias was one of many who toiled here, each hand shaping the stone into something both beautiful and necessary – from delicate carvings depicting forgotten stories to colossal statues that rose as testaments to time itself. 

His current project, however, was far more personal than the others. The intricate carving of a mythical dragon on a massive sandstone slab had been commissioned by his younger sister's betrothed. A man whose wealth and influence dwarfed anything Elias himself could imagine, yet who still carried an air of vulnerability Elias found fascinating.
