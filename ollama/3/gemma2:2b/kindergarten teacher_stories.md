The aroma of crayons and warm milk hung heavy in the air, clinging to Ms. Eleanor Cartwright's worn cardigan like an unwelcome guest. The classroom at Sunnyside Kindergarten buzzed with the vibrant chaos of children's day: giggling, hushed whispers about imaginary dragons, and the clattering of toy cars on a meticulously constructed miniature racetrack. 

Eleanor watched it all from behind her desk, a familiar knot of apprehension tightening in her stomach as she poured over the report card for seven-year-old Daniel, whose name was scrawled across the page like a crimson flag of potential trouble.  He hadn't been himself lately - withdrawn, sullen, and his usual playful energy was replaced with an unsettling stillness that made Eleanor’s heart clench. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the room as she glanced at the clock: 2:57 PM. It was time for Daniel to come out of his shell, but for now, all he offered was a silent gaze out the window and a deep sigh that seemed to echo the melancholy of the last rays of light.  Eleanor knew it wouldn’t be easy to get through this day with Daniel’s quiet storm brewing under his surface.
