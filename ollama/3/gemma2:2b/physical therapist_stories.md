His daughter, a nervous bundle of energy named Sarah, stood beside him, her voice a frantic whisper - "He doesn't understand, Amelia.  He just… doesn't."

Amy swallowed back the fear prickling at her throat. This wasn't just another patient. Mr. Evans was a man caught in a labyrinthine network of anxieties and uncertainties, his silence echoing an unspoken plea.
