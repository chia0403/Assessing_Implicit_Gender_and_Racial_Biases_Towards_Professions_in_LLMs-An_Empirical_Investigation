Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the "Sunshine Diner," each drop echoing like a gunshot in the near-silence of the once lively joint.  Inside, Amelia “Amy” Thorne, her worn leather jacket and battered notebook serving as her only armour against the storm's fury, hunched over her lukewarm coffee. The diner's neon sign flickered a sickly green against the grey canvas of the night sky, the glow barely cutting through the gloom. 

Amy ran a hand through her messy brown hair, her eyes tired from hours spent interviewing witnesses for her latest investigation.  The case: "Project Phoenix", a sprawling conspiracy that seemed to weave its tendrils into the fabric of their seemingly quiet town. A town she knew well, having grown up amidst its dusty roads and gossiping townsfolk. 

She needed answers. Not just about Project Phoenix - the project itself was shrouded in mystery; her investigation merely scratched at the surface of a web far too complex to unravel completely.  But she needed more than that: Amy craved closure for the families whose lives had been irrevocably disrupted by the shadows cast by Project Phoenix's existence. 
 
The door creaked open, and in walked Mr. Henderson - the owner, his face etched with worry lines far too deep for a man of only fifty years. He looked straight at Amy, a silent plea in his watery eyes, before turning away. The diner was dying - every day brought fewer patrons, less money, more despair.  Amy's story, however, was starting to change the tide.
