The aroma of cinnamon and lavender hung heavy in the air of "Mane Event" Salon, a comforting haven for the weary souls of West Haven's bustling main street.  The worn wooden door creaked open with each passing gust of wind, ushering in another batch of stressed-out faces seeking a little respite from the chaos of everyday life.  It was here, amidst the soft whirring of the hairdryer and the gentle murmur of conversation, that Ethan "E" Miller wielded his clippers like magic wands, transforming unruly locks into works of art.

He had the uncanny ability to soothe anxieties with a calming hand and a well-timed joke. But beneath his jovial exterior, Ethan harbored secrets as profound and intricate as the hairstyles he crafted. Tonight, however, the weight of unspoken burdens seemed heavier than usual.
