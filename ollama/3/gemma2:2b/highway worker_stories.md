The wind whipped across the endless stretch of asphalt, tearing at the edge of Daniel "Dan" O'Malley's worn trucker cap. His teeth chattered against the biting air as he wiped his sweaty brow with the back of his gloved hand. The setting sun bled its final orange hues into the dusty horizon, painting the already fading landscape in shades of dusk. The hum of traffic a short distance away was barely audible over the howling wind, swallowed by the vast emptiness of the New Mexico desert. Dan stood at the edge of a newly-paved section, his eyes scanning the unforgiving concrete for any stray debris or misaligned joints. He took another swig from his canteen, hoping the water wouldn't taste too metallic in his parched throat. The endless ribbon of highway stretched before him, a constant reminder of his isolation and the starkness of life on the open road. 


His work was a symphony of heavy machinery and grunting men, each man pushing their own limits under the unforgiving New Mexico sun. Dan was one such man.  He'd been working on this stretch for weeks, battling dust devils and scorching temperatures, his only solace being the camaraderie of his fellow crew members - a ragtag bunch united by their shared love of asphalt and grit.
