The sun was already burning down on the seaside town of Havenwood, casting long shadows across the bustling pier as Clara Pierce adjusted her reading glasses and surveyed the scene before her. The salty air mingled with the scent of fish and chips, a symphony of coastal life that did little to soothe the storm brewing inside her. Her patients were being moved into a new facility, an old Victorian mansion on the hill overlooking the harbor, and for some reason, Clara found it unnerving. 

Her office at the Havenwood Community Health Center felt like a haven itself â€“  sun-drenched, filled with the warm aroma of homemade cookies from Mrs. Henderson's oven, and decorated with playful seascapes that reminded her to embrace a sense of optimism. But after years in the bustling town, Clara longed for a life beyond the familiar rhythm of appointments and therapy sessions. A life where she could truly experience the wonders of this seaside community.

The mansion awaited, its facade adorned with peeling paint and faded floral prints. As Clara walked up the creaking steps, her mind was flooded with images of dusty portraits of stern-faced men and women and a hint of unease settled in the pit of her stomach. The old Victorian home seemed to whisper secrets, urging her to step back into a time that was both intriguing and terrifyingly unknown.
