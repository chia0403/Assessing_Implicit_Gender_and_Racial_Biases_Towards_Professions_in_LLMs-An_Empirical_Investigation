The air hung thick with the scent of asphalt and ozone as Felix "Rusty" Hayes climbed the ladder.  His boots scraped against the rusty metal of the scaffolding as he surveyed the sprawling Victorian mansion nestled among the towering oaks in Mill Creek, Ohio. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the intricate gables and delicate stonework that had stood for over a century. 

Felix was just another roofer, a cog in the machinery of the construction world. But there was something about this house that called to him – maybe it was the faded rose-colored shingles, maybe it held secrets whispered from generations past, or maybe he simply dreamt of walking through its grand halls and feeling the weight of history beneath his calloused fingertips. 

Today, though, his gaze focused on a single weathered brick that had been chipped away from the chimney’s base. The uneven mortar gaped like an open wound in a carefully preserved facade. It was more than just a repair job – it was a crack in the narrative, a sign of something hidden beneath the veneer of time.
