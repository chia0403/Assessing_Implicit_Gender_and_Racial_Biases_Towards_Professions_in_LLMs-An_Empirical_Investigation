The neon sign outside flickered on and off like a dying star in a cosmic vacuum. "Hank's Haven Diner," it read, the words barely illuminated against the backdrop of endless highway stretching to the horizon. Rain lashed down on the cracked asphalt of Route 66, turning the once-vibrant diner into an ominous puddle of despair. Inside, the only sound louder than the howling wind was the rattling hum of a lone CB radio, its static voice announcing another lonely soul seeking solace in the weary heart of America.

At the counter sat Thomas "Hank" Miller, his face weathered like old leather and framed by a shock of greying hair. His trucker hat, perpetually perched at a jaunty angle, obscured the tired blue eyes that darted around the diner as though trying to find an escape from the storm outside and the crushing weight of loneliness inside. Hank, a man who spent more years on the road than he had in any other place, felt the familiar ache of isolation gnawing at his soul. He wasn't just driving, he was navigating life; each mile was a journey through forgotten memories and unfulfilled dreams.
