The late afternoon sun filtered through the stained-glass window of Miller’s Pharmacy, casting intricate rainbows onto the worn linoleum floor. The aroma of lavender cough syrup mingled with the faint scent of old wood polish, a familiar yet comforting blend that Amelia Miller found utterly enchanting.  Amelia, known to regulars simply as "Amy," had spent her life amongst these shelves stacked high with pills and potions, dispensing them with a gentle precision honed over years of experience. Her nimble fingers moved with practiced grace as she filled prescriptions, each vial of medication a tiny universe of potential healing in its own right. 

But tonight, even the reassuring hum of daily routine couldn't calm the storm brewing within Amy. The usually vibrant shop felt suffocatingly still. Every customer who walked through the door - young and old, healthy and ailing - seemed to carry a flicker of fear she hadn't seen before. A shiver ran down her spine as she glanced at the latest news on her antiquated, rotary-dial phone: an unidentifiable disease was spreading across town, and the authorities were scrambling for answers.

The air hung heavy with unspoken anxieties, and Amy knew this wasn't just another typical Tuesday night at Miller’s Pharmacy. Tonight, something felt different, something ominous. It began with a whisper on her wind-blown street, then grew into a crescendo of hushed murmurs and hurried whispers that echoed throughout the town square.
