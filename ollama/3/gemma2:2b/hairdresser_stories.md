The rhythmic buzz of clippers against human hair became Elara's soundtrack to life. Her salon, "Curated Cuts," was tucked away in a quiet corner of Elmwood Street.  Its windows, perpetually veiled by dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun, held the promise of escape and transformation – for her clients, at least. 

Elara ran her fingers through Amelia's unruly waves, sighing as she did so. Amelia always came in on Tuesdays, a storm cloud of frustration clinging to her like an ill-fitting jacket. "They just don't get it," she'd grumble, eyes red and lips set tight. "My job, my life... everything feels so wrong."

Elara knew the feeling all too well. She felt it in the knots of anxiety that coiled around her own heart as she began work on Amelia's cascade of golden curls. It was a dance between chaos and creation, every strand a brushstroke on the canvas of Amelia's soul. Elara had always been fascinated by people, their stories hidden behind closed lids and fleeting smiles. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. A flicker of unease danced in her gut. Maybe it was the way Amelia’s eyes met hers, not with anger or despair, but with a quiet desperation she hadn't seen before. Or maybe it was the insistent hum of the dryer that seemed to echo the growing tension in the room, each blast of hot air like a whisper of something unspoken.
