Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Detective Elias Stone’s office. The storm had raged for hours, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside him.  He stared at the mugshot, his gaze heavy as lead.  Sergeant Olivia Miller, one of the youngest officers in his squad, was on trial today. Charged with assault and battery after a brutal scuffle with a suspect during an arrest. 

Elias, veteran detective and mentor to Miller, couldn’t shake off the knot in his stomach. He knew Olivia’s heart was in the right place – she saw the worst of humanity every day, but her determination to help was fierce. Still, there were cracks in the foundation of their relationship.  The whispers about Olivia's past had begun again, weaving a dangerous web of untrustworthiness in the eyes of his colleagues. 

He’d fought for her for years, shielding her from criticism and accusations, but this time, he felt the weight of their shared history pressing down on him. The storm outside mirrored the emotional tempest raging within him. This wasn’t just a trial; it was a test of their bond – the same one that bound them in a chaotic dance of justice and humanity in the city's underbelly.

Elias looked at the flashing red light from his desk lamp, its glow flickering like a warning sign. The night had just begun to spin its threads of darkness.
