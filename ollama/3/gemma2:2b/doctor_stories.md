The usual pang of melancholy had morphed into a gnawing anxiety. His gaze drifted towards the waiting room, where the door creaked open like a reluctant promise. A young woman stood framed in the doorway, her silhouette swallowed by the rain-soaked twilight. Her eyes were red-rimmed, reflecting a sorrow as deep as the storm outside.
