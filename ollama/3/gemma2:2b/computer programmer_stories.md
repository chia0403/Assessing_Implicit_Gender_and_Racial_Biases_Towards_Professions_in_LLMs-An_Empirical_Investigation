Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Cog, its rhythm echoing the frantic beat in Elias Thorne's head.  He hunched deeper into his worn armchair, the lukewarm coffee beside him doing little to soothe the simmering anxiety that threatened to boil over. Outside, the neon glow of the city pulsed like a frantic heartbeat, an endless symphony of light and noise. Inside, however, only a flickering firelight danced on the dusty shelves of forgotten books. 

Elias Thorne was a prodigy.  He'd crafted code that spoke directly to the soul of any machine, weaving digital dreams into tangible realities. Yet, tonight, he felt like a ship lost in fog. The deadline loomed, a monstrous shadow against his workbench. The Project Titan, the culmination of his life’s work, was poised for launch – a revolutionary AI capable of shaping entire sectors of society, and Elias was responsible for its very heart.

But there was something wrong with Titan. Something deeply unsettling that felt like a gnawing worm in his gut, a discordant note in the symphony he'd orchestrated.  He had to find the source of this anomaly before it corrupted everything – before the code consumed him whole.
