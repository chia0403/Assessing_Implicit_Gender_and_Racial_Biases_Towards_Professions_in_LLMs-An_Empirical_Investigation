The morning mist clung to Willow Creek like a damp shroud, clinging to the petals of the lilies and twisting around Amelia's ankles as she stepped out into the air.  Her boots crunched on frost-kissed leaves, sending delicate shivers through her worn wool socks. It was November, the month when the first chill nipped at the back of your neck even in the sunniest hours, and Amelia ran a hand through her auburn curls that always seemed to need more heat than they had. 

She was "Amelia's Bloom" –  the quaint name given to the little flower shop she'd inherited from her grandmother. A faded blue sign with chipped paint greeted customers at the entrance of the building, an old Victorian house where every inch of wood whispered secrets of forgotten days and blooming memories. Her small corner in Willow Creek was more than just a shop; it was a haven for lonely hearts, celebrations, and quiet grieving. 

Amelia's gaze wandered to the front door, its familiar warmth beckoning her closer.  She adjusted the floral crown woven into her braid and inhaled deeply, catching a whiff of fresh earth, damp leaves, and the heady perfume of carnations. Today was a special day – a wedding was in full swing across town, and Amelia had been entrusted with crafting the bridal bouquet.
