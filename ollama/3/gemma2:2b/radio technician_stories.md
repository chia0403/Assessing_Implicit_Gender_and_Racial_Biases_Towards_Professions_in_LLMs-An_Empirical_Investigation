The air hung thick with humidity as Elias Thornton adjusted his headset, the familiar whirring of the control panel filling his ears. The small shack perched precariously on the edge of a desolate stretch of Arizona desert was anything but serene. Heat shimmered off the cracked asphalt and the wind, hot and dry, whistled through rusted metal panels. 

His name was Elias Thornton. "Thor" to most folks who crossed paths with him. He'd spent the last decade in this little world, learning its ins and outs like a lover of dusty machinery, its secrets whispered by crackling static and flickering radios. It wasn’t glamorous work – mostly fixing broken equipment, patching down transmissions, and waiting for that one moment when a distant city would crackle to life on his monitor screen. But for Elias, it was a symphony of solace amidst the vast silence of the desert.  

Tonight, the hum of anticipation thrummed through his bones as he adjusted a dial, a lone wave of energy rippling across his workbench like a spider's web. Tonight, he had a chance to speak directly to the ghost city of Harmony Springs, an abandoned place nestled deep within the Sonoran desert where time seemed to have run out on dreams and hope had long since faded away. It was said that they used old radio transmissions for communication – a last-ditch effort from their past lives before the dust storms choked their once vibrant community into oblivion.  He tightened his grip on the microphone, his breath catching in his throat as he took a deep breath and whispered into the static-ridden silence: “Harmony Springs, this is Elias Thornton. Over.”
