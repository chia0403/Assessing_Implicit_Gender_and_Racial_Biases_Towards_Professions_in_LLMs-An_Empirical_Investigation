The docks thrummed with activity; merchants hawking wares to sailors eager for new voyages, children chasing stray coins amidst the throngs, and men with faces weathered by sun and sea. This was Gareth's home, this gritty port city he had sworn an oath to protect, even as it threatened to consume him in its relentless hunger.

A thick cloud of mist hung low over the harbor, obscuring the moon's light and amplifying the shadows that danced across the wet stone. A whisper of dread snaked its way through Gareth's gut – an unsettling premonition he couldn’t quite grasp but one that left him feeling like a prey animal caught in a hunter’s snare.
