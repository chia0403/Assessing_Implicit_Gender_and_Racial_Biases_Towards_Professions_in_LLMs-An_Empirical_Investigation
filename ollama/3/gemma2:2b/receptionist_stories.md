Rain lashed against the windows of "The Manor," its insistent rhythm echoing the frantic pulse of Evelyn Thorne's mind. The storm had been raging for hours, turning the once-grand facade into something more akin to a decaying castle, all chipped stone and shadowed eaves. Inside, her posture was stiff as a wilted sunflower, clutching a mountain of manila envelopes like a shield against the world. 

Evelyn wasn't used to this kind of anxiety, not in the usual way anyway.  She prided herself on composure - she had been the epitome of quiet efficiency at "The Manor" for three years. A receptionist by trade, but her role was more akin to guardian angel in a gilded cage, ensuring that each visitor and client found their way through the labyrinthine world of The Manor's business empire. 

Tonight though, everything felt different. This storm wasnâ€™t just rain; it was a swirling vortex of tension, uncertainty, and fear - an ominous storm brewing on the horizon that seemed to be pulling Evelyn into its depths as she sorted through the endless stream of paperwork. 
  
The air in The Manor held the weight of secrets whispered in hushed tones over countless cups of Earl Grey tea. Tonight, however, the weight felt heavier than usual, pressing down on her like an impending doom.
