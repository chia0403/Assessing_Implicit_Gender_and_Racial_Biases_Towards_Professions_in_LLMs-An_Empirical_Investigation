Rain hammered against the attic window, blurring the streetlights into smudged specks of yellow. Inside, Amelia Finch adjusted her glasses, squinting at the ledger before her as if she could coax some secrets from its worn pages. "Thirty-seven," she murmured, tapping the number pensively. Thirty-seven missing receipts, all tucked away in this dusty trove of old accounts.  Amelia was no stranger to a good mystery, and this one was a doozy. 

The antique shop on Elm Street, where Amelia worked as a bookkeeper, had always been an enigma wrapped in the scent of old paper and forgotten dreams. It was more than just her job; it was a legacy, passed down from her grandmother who'd inherited the shop after the previous owner passed away under a shroud of mystery. The bookshelves held whispers of past lives, each book a portal to another time.  Amelia’s days were spent deciphering the cryptic language of faded invoices and handwritten wills. Her evenings were filled with trying to unravel the secrets hidden in the dusty corners of her grandmother's journals. 

Tonight, though, was different. A cold knot sat in Amelia's stomach as she turned the final page, a crisp white sheet fluttering out into the air like a ghost. This wasn’t just another case; this felt personal. The missing receipts were linked to something bigger -  something that hummed beneath the surface of the shop’s quiet rhythm. 


And it was time Amelia took charge.
