## Setting:

The humid air hung thick and heavy in the San Francisco Bay Area, clinging to Dr. Anya Patel like an unwelcome guest. It was July, a time when fog rolled in, blanketing the city in a serene yet unsettling stillness. The quaint Victorian homes of Noe Valley were draped in layers of grey mist as Anya stood on her usual afternoon break, the air thick with the smell of incense and damp laundry from Mrs. Reyes's apartment building downstairs. 

## Character:

Anya Patel, a sharp-eyed physician assistant with a quick smile and an even quicker mind, was used to facing patients' anxieties head-on. Working at Dr. Chen's clinic on Castro Street for the past five years, she found comfort in her routine – charting patients' vitals, dispensing medication, and offering empathetic support to those who walked through her doctor's door.  But lately, something had shifted. The usual symphony of bustling clinic sounds felt discordant, replaced by an underlying tension that lingered like a stray cloud on the horizon. 

## Story Opening:

Anya adjusted her glasses as she stepped off the rickety wooden stairs of Mrs. Reyes' building, the faint sound of an old jazz song emanating from the nearby café.  The familiar melody seemed out of place, its rhythm jarring against the uneasy hum in the air. A few weeks ago, Dr. Chen had been called away for a medical conference in Reno, leaving Anya to handle the clinic solo, a fact that usually filled her with quiet confidence but now felt like an unwelcome weight.

Suddenly, a wave of anxiety washed over her as she saw Mrs. Reyes's worried face peering from behind the worn wooden door.  "Anya, darling," she began, her voice trembling ever so slightly, "The...the boy at the clinic...he had another episode."
