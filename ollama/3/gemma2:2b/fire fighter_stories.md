## The Smoke Eater 

**Setting:**  The humid summer night air hung heavy in Portland, Oregon. Rain clung to the evergreens lining the streets, creating a hazy veil that obscured the twinkling lights of the city. The towering Douglas fir at the edge of the abandoned warehouse district pulsed a pale blue from the emergency beacon strapped to its trunk – the last bastion of hope for Ethan "Sparks" Miller, firefighter extraordinaire.

**Character:** Ethan “Sparks” Miller was not your average firefighter. He wasn't just built to battle flames; he was built with them. His hands were rough, calloused, and perpetually smoldered in an internal fire that matched his nickname.  For years, Sparks had been a beacon of hope for the city's most devastating infernos, earning him a reputation as much feared as revered.  He’d wrestled down leviathans of timber-and-trash flames with a quiet ferocity that bordered on otherworldly. Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, he faced something entirely new – a fire that wasn't a blaze, but a silent, insidious presence, consuming not wood and steel, but memories. 


The warehouse doors creaked open as Sparks stepped inside, the pungent scent of rot and decay assaulting his nostrils.  The air hung thick with sorrow, a palpable weight pressing down on him like a physical burden. "Alright, firebird," he murmured, his voice rough from years of battling infernos, "Let's dance."
