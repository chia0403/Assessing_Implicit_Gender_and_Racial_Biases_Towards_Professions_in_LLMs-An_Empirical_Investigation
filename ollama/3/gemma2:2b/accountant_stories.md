Rain lashed against the windowpane of Mr. Theodore Finch's office, mimicking the relentless rhythm of his increasingly anxious heartbeat. The aroma of stale coffee mingled with the acrid tang of burnt paper - remnants of another tax season gone awry.  Theodore rubbed his eyes, his gaze sweeping across the chaos: stacks of crumpled invoices, overflowing filing cabinets, a lone, forlorn calculator weeping in the corner. He was Mr. Finch, an accountant by trade and a chronic worrier by nature.  But tonight felt different, heavier than usual, like a storm brewing not just outside but within him too. 

**Setting:**  A cramped office tucked away on the second floor of a Victorian-era building in Boston.  The city lights bled through grimy windows, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering neon sign advertising "Finch & Associates: Accounting for your Tomorrow." 


**Character Name:** Mr. Theodore Finch
