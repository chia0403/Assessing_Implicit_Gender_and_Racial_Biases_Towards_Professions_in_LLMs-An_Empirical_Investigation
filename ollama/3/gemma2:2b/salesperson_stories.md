The midday sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Carter's already sweat-soaked brow as she pushed open the heavy glass door to Serenity Spa. The air inside was thick with the scent of lavender and sandalwood, a stark contrast to the bustling city outside.  Every surface gleamed under the soft blue lights that seemed designed to highlight the expensive-looking towels and plush cushions in their signature spa rooms. Amy had been a saleswoman for five years now, and this was her haven; the perfect place to sell dreams of relaxation. 

Amy's usual customers were looking weary, not just from the city traffic but also the overwhelming sense of pressure that seemed to emanate from every corner of her life.  She imagined their worries melting away in the warm whirlpool she was about to pitch them on... after all, a good massage could do wonders for the soul. 


**Setting:** A serene spa nestled between high-rise buildings and bustling streets.
**Character:** Amy Carter, a saleswoman with a knack for selling dreams of relaxation.
