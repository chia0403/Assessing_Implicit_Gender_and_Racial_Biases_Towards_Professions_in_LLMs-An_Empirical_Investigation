Rain lashed against the office window, blurring the already dim streetlights into shimmering halos.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Hayes hunched over her screen, battling against an endless stream of error messages that seemed to pulsate in sync with the storm's fury. Her coffee cup sat neglected on the desk, a skeletal reflection of its former caffeinated self. Across the cubicle wall, Kevin, a senior programmer known for his laid-back demeanor, tapped away at his keyboard, his eyes glued to the screen with an unsettling calm. "This is like debugging a rogue AI in Chernobyl," he muttered, chuckling darkly.  

Amy sighed.  Another failed network integration. Another night spent wrestling with a system's stubborn glitches. The sprawling office complex of "Innovate Technologies," once vibrant and buzzing with innovation, now echoed the oppressive silence of an abandoned warehouse. Amy had come here seeking a fresh start after years in a stifling corporate machine. But the reality was far from the utopian dreams she'd nurtured while devouring sci-fi novels as a teenager. 

She glanced at the stack of paperwork piled on her desk - project proposals, client contracts, and a growing list of deadlines that seemed to stretch endlessly before her. This wasn't the exciting world of coding and innovation sheâ€™d imagined. It was more like being trapped inside a machine itself, grinding away with relentless efficiency, the gears of reality slowly but inevitably grinding her down.  

The door clicked open, interrupting Amy's despair. The ever-so-slightly irritated face of their new CEO, Mr. Chen, peered over his glasses at her. "Amy," he began, his voice a dry rasp that carried a hint of world-weariness, "There's been... an incident." 


**Setting:** A small, dimly lit office within the Innovate Technologies complex.
