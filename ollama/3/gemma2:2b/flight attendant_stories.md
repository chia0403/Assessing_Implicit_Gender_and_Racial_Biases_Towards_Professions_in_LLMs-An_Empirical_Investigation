## The Flight to Nowhere

**Opening Scene:** 

The Boeing 747's belly groaned as it lumbered through the stormy sky, rain lashing against the windows like angry fists. Inside First Class cabin, Amelia “Amy” Thorne adjusted her signature red scarf and surveyed the disgruntled faces in front of her. The flight was delayed for "unknown reasons" - a phrase she found endlessly frustrating since it offered no real answer. 

She glanced at the clock on the passenger entertainment system, its screen flickering like a dying candle: 4:17 PM PST.  A cruel reminder that Amelia had a three-hour layover in Salt Lake City before her destination to Hawaii – which now felt more like purgatory than paradise. Her usual cheerful disposition was starting to fade as she fought against the rising tide of frustration.

**Setting:**

* **Time:** Late summer, 2023
* **Location:**  Salt Lake City International Airport (SLC), Utah. This is a major international hub with several airlines and frequent flights, but also a notoriously bustling airport known for its unpredictable weather patterns and tight schedules.


**Character Details:**

* **Name:** Amelia "Amy" Thorne 
* **Occupation:** Flight attendant on the American Airlines flight (Flight #172) from Los Angeles to Honolulu.
* **Personality:**  Cheerful, efficient, and dedicated. Amy thrives on routine and a sense of order, but her life is thrown into chaos when unexpected delays happen.


**Possible Next Steps:**

1. Introduce a passenger with whom Amy has a history - perhaps someone she's had a run-in with before?
2. Focus on the storm and its impact on the flight. 
3. Explore Amy's inner thoughts: What makes her feel so restless, and what is the source of her frustrations?  



This opening sets up the character, the setting, and creates suspense for what could be a thrilling story. The delay has brought about an unexpected turn in the plot – perhaps someone on board is seeking refuge, or something even more dramatic.
