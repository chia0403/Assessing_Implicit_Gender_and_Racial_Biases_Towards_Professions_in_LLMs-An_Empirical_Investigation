Rain pattered against the windowpane of Dr. Evelyn Bell's office, mimicking the steady rhythm of her heart as she stared at the neatly stacked file folders.  Each file held the raw stories of human suffering - anxieties masked as everyday stresses, and wounds hidden beneath smiles that had been forged in fire. Evelyn was a seasoned counselor, able to discern the language of the soul through a patient's unspoken words, but tonight, a knot tightened in her stomach, a feeling she hadn't experienced since moving to this quaint seaside town two years ago. 

Her office was a haven nestled amidst the sprawling cliffs and crashing waves of Seahaven, its charm reminiscent of an old Victorian mansion.  It held antique furniture with faded floral patterns, a library stocked with tomes on mental health, and sunlight that danced across worn-out leather sofas like fireflies in twilight. Yet tonight, the air felt heavy with unspoken tension, a feeling only heightened by the storm raging outside. Evelyn adjusted her glasses, took a deep breath, and then picked up a file labeled "The Missing Child."  As she opened it, a sharp gust of wind rattled the windowpane, echoing the disquiet in her own soul.
