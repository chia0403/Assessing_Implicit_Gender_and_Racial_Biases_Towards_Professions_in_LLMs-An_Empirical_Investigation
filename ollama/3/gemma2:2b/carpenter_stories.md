The late afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across Old Mill Lane, the familiar scent of sawdust hanging heavy in the air. Rain pattered on the roof of Caleb Thorne's workshop, a melodic counterpoint to the rhythmic rasping of his saw. The air was thick with the aroma of pine and cedar - a blend as comforting as the worn leather of his work apron. 

Caleb Thorne wasn’t just any carpenter; he was an artisan, a weaver of dreams from wood and nails. His workshop housed a symphony of sounds – hammers banging against timber, sawteeth singing their song, and the soft crackle of parchment as he meticulously drafted blueprints for a sprawling barn to be built on the edge of the whispering woods.  His hands were roughened by years of toil, calloused yet precise, capable of turning wood into magic.
