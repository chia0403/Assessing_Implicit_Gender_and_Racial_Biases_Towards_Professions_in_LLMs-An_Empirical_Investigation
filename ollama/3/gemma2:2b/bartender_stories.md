Rain hammered against the windows of "The Broken Compass," each drop sounding like a small fist pounding on the glass. Inside, dust motes danced in the amber glow of the lamplight, illuminating the worn leather booths and the chipped porcelain mugs stacked precariously next to the bar.  Eira Thorne, known as Elara to those who knew her well enough, was polishing glasses with an almost meditative hand. Her fingers moved fluidly, tracing patterns on each glass like a painter drawing in invisible strokes of light. She wore her usual black apron and faded blue dress, her dark hair pulled back in a practical bun that did little to hide the sharp angles of her face. 

Tonight was different. The usual steady stream of regulars had dried up, replaced by a strange silence, thick with unspoken tension. A storm raged not just outside the pub but also inside Elara's heart. Tonight, she was waiting for someone, anyone really, who could help her find what she was looking for - something that felt like a ghost in the dim recesses of her memory.  She'd found herself drawn back to this old haunt after years away, haunted by a forgotten truth, and Elara swore she had a feeling that the storm outside wasn’t just weather – it was carrying something else, something dangerous. 


The air in "The Broken Compass" hummed with more than just water droplets and the murmur of the wind. Something felt off, like a sleeping giant stirring in the shadows.  Elara took a deep breath, hoping that she could find her courage somewhere within the swirling storm brewing both inside and outside the pub.
