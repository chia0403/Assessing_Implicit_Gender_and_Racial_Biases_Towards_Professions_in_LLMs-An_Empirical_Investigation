Rain lashed against the storefront windows of "Sunnyside Corner," its relentless rhythm mimicking the nervous drumming of Amelia's fingers on the cash register screen. A thick fog clung to the air, blurring the edges of everything except the flickering fluorescent lights overhead. 

Amelia was just finishing her shift as the last customers trickled out –  a tired-looking couple clutching a half-eaten pack of stale donuts; a solitary businessman hunched over his phone in the corner booth; and a young boy with a lopsided grin, his eyes wide as saucers. She’d seen them all before at Sunnyside Corner, her little slice of normalcy in the storm-ravaged city.  Today, though, felt different. The air hung heavy, a tangible tension that seemed to ripple through the cramped space. 

Amelia knew there were bigger storms brewing than the one outside. Tonight, something was off – the usual hum of conversations and the comforting clatter of cash drawers had been replaced with an unsettling silence.  And then came the knock on the door. A lone figure stepped inside, shrouded in a heavy coat that concealed his face. As he walked towards her, Amelia couldn't help but feel a tremor run down her spine.
