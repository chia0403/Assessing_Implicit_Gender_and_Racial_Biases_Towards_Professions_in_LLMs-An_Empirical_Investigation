The crisp autumn air whipped Agnes's skirts around her legs as she scurried across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor. The sun was dipping below the horizon, painting the sky with streaks of fiery orange and deep purple, the colors mirroring the tension simmering beneath Agnes's normally placid demeanor.  Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled amidst rolling hills, had always been an enchanting place. But tonight, even its charm couldn't mask the underlying unease that hung thick in the air.

Agnes, known as "Ag" to her friends and colleagues alike, was no stranger to the occasional flurry of activity at Blackwood Manor.  She'd served as the estate's housekeeper for years, a quiet presence who kept the mansion in pristine order. But tonight, a heavy sense of foreboding clung to every corner of the grand house, its silence punctuated by an unnerving lack of laughter and the hushed whispers exchanged between servants like shadows in the deepening twilight. 

The last few days had been marked by a growing unease, culminating in the mysterious disappearance of Lord Blackwood himself, leaving behind only a single note: "Find me," it read in elegant cursive.  Now, Agnes found herself at the heart of this mystery. As she gazed at the grand oak doors leading to the manor's hidden library, a chill ran down her spine - something was terribly wrong.
