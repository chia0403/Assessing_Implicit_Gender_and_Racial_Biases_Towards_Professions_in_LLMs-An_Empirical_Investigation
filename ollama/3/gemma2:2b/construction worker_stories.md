##  The Steel Symphony

Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Frank "Ironhand" Miller's shack, mimicking the ceaseless roar of the cranes that clawed at the sky above. A symphony of steel and sweat filled the air - a counterpoint to the howling wind that battered his little world just beyond the factory walls. Ironhand squinted through the rain-streaked window, watching the endless dance of machines and men as they built the newest behemoth: the Skyreach Tower, destined to pierce the clouds themselves.

Frank had never been one for the heights. He was built for the ground, for the earth's firm embrace. But that was before fate brought him here, before his wife's illness forced him to confront a new world of steel and gravity. It was a burden he carried on his broad shoulders, a weight that pressed down harder than the leaden sky above.
