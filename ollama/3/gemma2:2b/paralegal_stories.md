Rain lashed against the high windows of the Chicago law firm's office building, each drop blurring the city lights into streaks of neon gold. Inside, Amelia Thorne, her brown eyes tired but focused, reviewed the legal documents for the second time that day.  Her usual solace was lost in a sea of contracts and depositions; even the comforting aroma of old coffee had failed to lift the weight of her mounting frustration. The case: a complex family law dispute involving allegations of abuse and inheritance. It felt stifling, like being trapped in a room with too much air and not enough light. 

Amelia's fingers tapped a restless rhythm against the worn-out surface of her desk; she was a paralegal for Mr. Evans, a renowned attorney who seemed to specialize in navigating the murky waters of family disputes. Yet, despite years of experience, Amelia yearned for something more – a spark that eluded her even amidst the stacks of legal documents and the hushed whispers of lawyers discussing case strategies. A story about the man who had been her father's partner, her father’s best friend - now dead.
