The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thorne's head like trapped bees in a wire cage. She ran her fingers through her already-messy hair as she surveyed the chaotic scene before her: mountains of tax forms stacked precariously on her desk, coffee brewing in the background with an unnerving clinking sound, and a dozen frantic clients spilling into the room from the waiting area like overripe apples dropped into a basket.  It was April 15th, and Amelia Thorne, income tax preparer extraordinaire, was facing her busiest day of the year.

Amelia adjusted her tired-looking spectacles and took a deep breath. The smell of stale coffee, old paper, and that slightly metallic tang associated with anxious souls hit her in a familiar wave. She ran a hand through her already disheveled hair and sighed.  This wasn't exactly the life she'd envisioned when she graduated college, armed with a degree in Economics and an unwavering desire to be anything but another cog in a corporate machine. 

Now, surrounded by spreadsheets and IRS jargon, Amelia found herself drawn deeper into the labyrinth of tax law than ever before. Her dream of financial freedom felt like an ever-distant island on a vast ocean of paperwork and deadlines. The only solace she found was in helping others navigate this treacherous world of taxes; however, it often left her feeling drained and overwhelmed. 

As she sorted through a particularly confusing pile of W-2 forms, Amelia couldn't help but feel that the weight of the entire tax season rested on her weary shoulders. This year felt heavier than ever.
