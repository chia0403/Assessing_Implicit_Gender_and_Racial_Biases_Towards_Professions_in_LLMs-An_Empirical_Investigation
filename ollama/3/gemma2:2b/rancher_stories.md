The wind whipped across Dust Devil Canyon like a banshee’s wail, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and dust.  A fine layer of grit coated everything in sight: the weathered wooden fence posts that marked the boundaries of Jebediah "Jeb" Stone's sprawling ranch, the rusted metal gate creaking as if protesting against the relentless onslaught of sand and wind, even the worn-out boots of the man himself. 

Jeb, with his calloused hands and eyes etched with the map of a lifetime spent under the unforgiving California sun, squinted at the horizon.  A crimson streak bled across the canvas of the sky, promising a storm on the heels of a dry spell that had plagued them for months.  The once-fertile fields were now parched brown, the cattle weary and lean under the scorching glare. 

For Jeb, this wasn't just about drought; it was a testament to his own dwindling hope. The land that had held generations of Stone's legacy was starting to yield its bitter secrets - one by one, each cow giving up as if they too knew something was wrong.  Jeb’s grip on the weathered steering wheel tightened as he began his daily walk around his property – a ritualistic dance against an encroaching emptiness.
