Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Evelyn Ainsworthâ€™s classroom, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  Chalk dust swirled in the air illuminated by the anemic glow of the fluorescent lights overhead. The clock ticked with agonizing slowness, each second a reminder that she was stuck here, in this decaying husk of a school building, for another agonizing hour.

The bell wouldn't ring for another forty-five minutes, and Ms. Ainsworth's tenth-grade English class, usually boisterous and full of teenage energy, sat subdued and silent.  They seemed to sense her unease, mirroring it with their own sullen stillness. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient windowpanes and sending shivers down her spine.


This wasn't how she pictured her life. Ten years ago, fresh out of university with stars in her eyes, Evelyn had envisioned herself teaching literature to bright young minds in a vibrant, well-funded school. Instead, she found herself trapped in Hawthorne High, a crumbling institution on the wrong side of town, where apathy and despair hung heavy in the air like smog.
