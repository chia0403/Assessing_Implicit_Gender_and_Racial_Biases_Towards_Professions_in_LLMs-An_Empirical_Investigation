The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered aisles of "Bargain Bonanza." The air hung thick with the scent of day-old donuts and industrial cleaner. Beatrice Ophelia Plumtree sighed, her gaze drifting from the endless stream of discounted merchandise to the clock ticking relentlessly above the checkout counter. 

Three o'clock. Two more hours until she could escape this retail purgatory.  Beatrice adjusted her nametag – slightly askew thanks to a rogue toddler earlier – and plastered on her best customer service smile. A woman with hair dyed an alarming shade of purple approached, laden with bags overflowing with bargain-priced kitchen gadgets. Beatrice braced herself for the inevitable barrage of coupons and price comparisons. This was just another Tuesday at Bargain Bonanza.
