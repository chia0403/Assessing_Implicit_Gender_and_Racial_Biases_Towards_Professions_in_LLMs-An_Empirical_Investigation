The whir of clippers danced with the tinny pop music leaking from Eliza's ancient boombox, creating a strangely comforting rhythm in the cramped salon. Eliza Mae Cartwright surveyed her work in the mirror, a perfectly sculpted bob framing the sharp cheekbones of Mrs. Henderson. 

"There you go, dear," Eliza chirped, brushing away stray hairs. "Good as new."

Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose age was impossible to guess thanks to an expertly applied layer of foundation and her perpetually permed silver curls, beamed back. 

"Eliza, you're a miracle worker! My Harold wouldn't recognize me."

Eliza chuckled, "Harold's got good taste, then. He'll be happy to see his lovely wife looking so refreshed."

But as Mrs. Henderson sashayed out the door, leaving behind a cloud of lilac perfume and the faint echo of her laughter, Eliza felt a familiar pang of unease. The salon was quiet again, the rhythmic clatter of clippers replaced by the incessant tick-tock of the clock on the wall.

Eliza's reflection stared back at her – tired eyes framed by greying hair pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hands, calloused and strong from years of wielding scissors and combs, seemed to be losing their magic touch. The once bustling salon, a haven for gossip and laughter, was now eerily empty. 

Eliza knew what she had to do. It was time to face the music – or rather, the lack thereof. Her clientele was dwindling, her lease was up soon, and her dreams were starting to feel as faded as the floral wallpaper peeling from the walls.
