Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside him.  Stacked ledgers threatened to topple from his desk, their crisp edges softened by years of frantic calculations and spilled coffee. Bart, a man whose neatly combed hair and starched collar betrayed an underlying desperation, stared at the glaring red numbers on his computer screen. The Finch & Finch accounting firm, a legacy passed down through generations, was drowning in debt. His grandfather, a stern but shrewd businessman, would be turning in his grave. 


Bart ran a weary hand through his thinning hair.  He needed a miracle, and fast. The only problem was, miracles weren't exactly part of the accounting equation.

The phone on his desk buzzed, jolting him from his thoughts. It was Mrs. Peabody, his most troublesome client, demanding to know why her quarterly statement wasn't ready yet. Bart sighed. Maybe a miracle wouldn't be so bad after all.
