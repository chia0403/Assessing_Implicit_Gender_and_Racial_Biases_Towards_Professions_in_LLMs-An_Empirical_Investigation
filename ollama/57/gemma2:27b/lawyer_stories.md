Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already dismal view of the alleyway below.  The incessant drumming was a fitting soundtrack to the knot of dread twisting in her stomach. Across from her sat Mrs. Delgado, her face creased with worry lines deeper than any she should have at 45. Her hands clutched a worn photograph – a young man beaming, his arm slung around a woman Eleanor vaguely recognized as Mrs. Delgado's daughter.  "He wouldn't hurt a fly," Mrs. Delgado whispered, her voice thick with unshed tears. "Miguel is a good boy. He wouldn't…" she trailed off, unable to articulate the nightmare that had consumed their lives.


Eleanor Vance, known for her steely resolve in the courtroom, felt a pang of sympathy. This wasn't just another case; it was a mother pleading for her son. The air hung heavy with desperation and the faint scent of Mrs. Delgado's lavender perfume, a futile attempt to mask the underlying odor of fear.  Eleanor knew she had a tough fight ahead. Miguel Delgado was accused of arson, a charge that carried a hefty sentence.  But something in Mrs. Delgado's eyes – a flicker of unwavering faith – ignited a spark of determination within Eleanor. She wouldn't let this woman down. She would find the truth, even if it meant battling a system rigged against them.
