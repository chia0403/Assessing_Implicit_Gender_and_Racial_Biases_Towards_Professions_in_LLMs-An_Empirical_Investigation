The harsh fluorescent lights of the operating room seemed to buzz in time with Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Thorne's racing heartbeat. Sweat prickled on her brow despite the frigid air conditioning. The patient, a young woman barely out of her teens, lay still under the bright beam, her chest rising and falling shallowly with each mechanical breath from the ventilator. Evelyn traced the delicate lines of the incision she'd just made, her scalpel steady in her hand despite the pressure building in her chest. This surgery was unlike anything she'd ever faced before â€“ a rare congenital defect, a tangled web of arteries and veins threatening to unravel with every passing moment.

The OR, usually a sanctuary of controlled chaos, felt suffocatingly quiet tonight. The only sounds were the rhythmic beeping of the monitors and the whispered anxieties of the nurses gathered around her. Evelyn knew their eyes were on her, watching her every move, hoping for a miracle.
