Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the world outside into a watercolour mess of grey and green. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, casting an antiseptic glow over the sterile waiting room. Amelia Rose Cartwright, OT, tapped her pen impatiently against the clipboard, her gaze flitting between the clock on the wall and the double doors leading to the therapy gym.

Amelia was known for her patience, but this storm had thrown a wrench into her carefully planned schedule. Three patients were late due to flooded roads, and she felt a familiar pang of frustration rise in her chest. It wasn't just the inconvenience; it was the knowledge that every minute wasted meant another minute her patients weren't progressing towards their goals.

Her focus shifted as the double doors swung open with a hiss. A young man, his face pale and drawn, shuffled into the room, leaning heavily on a cane. This was David Miller, Amelia's first appointment of the day - a promising musician whose dreams had been shattered by a devastating car accident six months ago. He looked at her with a mixture of apprehension and hope in his tired eyes.

Amelia knew this session would be crucial for David. Today, they were attempting something new â€“ playing his beloved guitar again. The instrument sat untouched on a stand in the corner, a silent reminder of all he had lost.
