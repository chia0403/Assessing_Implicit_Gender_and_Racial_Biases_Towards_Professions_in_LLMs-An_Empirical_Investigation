Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the streetlights into swirling halos of orange. Emilia "Em" Reyes gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white, as she navigated the slick streets. The siren's wail pierced through the drumming rain, a desperate plea echoing in the night. Em wasn't new to this - the adrenaline rush, the gut-clenching anxiety, the grim satisfaction of saving lives â€“ it was all part of being an EMT in New Orleans. But tonight felt different. 

The call had been terse: "Multiple victims, possible active shooter, Bourbon Street." Her partner, Liam, sat beside her, his face grim but resolute.  Bourbon Street at night was a chaotic symphony of music, laughter, and the scent of beignets. Now it would likely be a scene of carnage. As they turned onto the rain-slicked cobblestones, Em braced herself for the worst.
