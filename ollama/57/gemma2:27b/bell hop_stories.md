The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby hung thick with the scent of lilies and old money.  Golden light streamed through the stained-glass dome overhead, illuminating swirling dust motes and the polished mahogany counter where Theodore "Teddy" Wainwright stood, adjusting his bow tie for the hundredth time. Teddy wasn't cut out for this place. He dreamed of writing novels, not ferrying steamer trunks and answering the endless demands of entitled guests.  But with a family to feed and rent to pay, the bellhop gig was the only steady income he could find. 

Today was especially hectic. A convention of socialites had descended upon the Blackwood, their luggage overflowing with designer gowns and enough champagne to float a small yacht. Teddy sighed, bracing himself for another onslaught of demanding suitcases and haughty pronouncements. Just then, a limousine pulled up outside the grand entrance, its chrome glinting under the midday sun.

Teddy glanced out the window and felt a shiver run down his spine.  He recognized the emblem on the car door â€“ a stylized phoenix rising from flames. It belonged to Alistair Blackwood, the enigmatic billionaire who owned the hotel and rarely graced it with his presence. What was he doing here? And what secrets did the shadows in his piercing blue eyes hold?
