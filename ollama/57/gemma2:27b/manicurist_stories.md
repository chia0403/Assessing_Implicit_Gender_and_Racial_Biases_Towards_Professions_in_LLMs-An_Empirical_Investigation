The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender, punctuated by the sharp chirping of a sparrow trapped outside Amelia "Amy" Flores's window. It was a typical Tuesday afternoon at "Painted Ladies," Amy's little nail salon tucked away in a bustling Brooklyn neighborhood. Sunlight streamed through the dusty storefront window, illuminating flecks of glitter on her workbench and casting long shadows from the potted peace lilies that flanked the pedicure station.  

Outside, the rumble of the B67 bus mingled with the shouts of street vendors and the rhythmic thumping of music spilling from a nearby bodega. But inside "Painted Ladies," it was Amy's world: a haven of soft chatter, the gentle whirring of her electric file, and the soothing clink of glass nail polish bottles against each other.  Today, however, an unsettling quiet hung over the salon. Amy glanced nervously at the empty pedicure chair, its plush velvet cushion still damp from Ms. Rodriguez's morning appointment. 

Something wasn't right.
