The sunrise bled across the horizon in streaks of bruised orange and lavender, illuminating the dust motes dancing in Elijah Blackwood's ramshackle barn. The scent of hay mingled with the sharp tang of manure, a familiar perfume that Elijah had breathed for all his forty-two years. His calloused hands tightened around the worn wooden handle of his pitchfork, the wood smooth from decades of use. Outside, the rooster's insistent crow pierced the morning quiet, a call to action echoed by the lowing of cattle and the bleating of sheep in the fields beyond. Today was harvest day, a crucial day that would determine whether Elijah and his family would eat through the harsh winter months ahead. The weight of responsibility settled on his shoulders like a shroud, heavier than any sack of grain he'd ever lifted.
