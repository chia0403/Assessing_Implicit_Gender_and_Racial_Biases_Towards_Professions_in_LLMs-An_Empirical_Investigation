The air in the waiting room hung thick with anxiety and antiseptic. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn vinyl chairs and chipped linoleum floor. Amelia Grace Cartwright adjusted her stethoscope, its cool metal a familiar comfort against her chest. She'd been a registered nurse at Mercy General for five years now, and the waiting room was a place she knew intimately – the shuffling of worried feet, the hushed sobs muffled by hands, the frantic flip-through of magazines that no one truly read.

Today, however, felt different. The air crackled with an unusual tension, a palpable fear that clung to every cough and sigh.  A tremor ran through Amelia's hand as she glanced at the clock on the wall - 3:17 am. This wasn't her usual shift. She'd been called in due to a sudden influx of patients presenting with bizarre symptoms – fever, disorientation, inexplicable rashes. The doctors were baffled, whispers of an unknown pathogen circulating through the staff.

Amelia took a deep breath, forcing herself to focus.  She was a nurse, trained to face the unknown with calm and compassion. Whatever this new threat was, she would be ready.
