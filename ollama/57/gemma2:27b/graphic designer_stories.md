Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia "Amy" Chen's tiny studio apartment, blurring the cityscape into a watercolour mess. The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and despair. Amy stared at her computer screen, her normally bright hazel eyes dulled with frustration.

The deadline for the new artisanal bakery logo was looming, and she was drawing a blank. Every design felt flat, generic, lacking that spark of whimsy and warmth the client had requested.

She longed to be outside, breathing in fresh air and sketching amidst the vibrant chaos of Chinatown, her usual source of inspiration. But tonight, the storm seemed to mirror the tempest raging within her creative soul.
