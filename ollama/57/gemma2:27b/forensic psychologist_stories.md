The pungent smell of formaldehyde clung to Dr. Evangeline Thorne like an unwelcome guest as she surveyed the crime scene. The victim lay sprawled on the cold steel table, bathed in the harsh fluorescent light of the morgue. A young woman, barely out of her teens, with long auburn hair fanned across the stark white sheet covering most of her body. Evangeline carefully adjusted her latex gloves, the thin rubber squeaking against her skin.

This wasn't her first rodeo. Evangeline had seen her share of grisly deaths in her five years as a forensic psychologist for the NYPD. But there was something about this case – the unsettling serenity etched on the victim’s face, the single crimson rose clutched in her lifeless hand – that sent a shiver down her spine.

The air hung heavy with unspoken questions: Who was she? Why was she here? And who had stolen the light from her young eyes? Evangeline steeled herself, knowing that the answers lay buried somewhere within the labyrinthine corridors of the victim's mind.  She began her meticulous examination, determined to unlock the secrets hidden beneath the surface and bring justice to this nameless soul.

The morgue, a sterile haven of stainless steel and tiled floors, hummed with a low, constant thrum from the ventilation system. The only other sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of Evangeline's silver watch against her wrist, each second echoing the relentless march towards uncovering the truth.
