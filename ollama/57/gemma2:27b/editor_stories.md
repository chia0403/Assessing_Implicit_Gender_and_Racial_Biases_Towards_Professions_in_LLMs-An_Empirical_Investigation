The rain hammered against the attic window, each drop a staccato beat in Eleanor Blackwood's symphony of stress. Her cluttered desk overflowed with manuscripts â€“ dog-eared pages peeking from overflowing folders, coffee mugs stained with weeks-old caffeine rings, and a half-eaten croissant stubbornly clinging to life beneath a crumpled rejection letter. 

Eleanor was the editor at Blackwood & Sons Publishing, a small but fiercely independent house nestled on a cobblestone street in Edinburgh's historic Old Town. She'd inherited the business from her grandfather, a gruff but brilliant man who believed words held magic. Eleanor, however, felt more like a magician struggling to pull a rabbit out of a hat than conjure literary gold.

Today was the deadline for submissions, and she was drowning in mediocrity.
