The humid air hung heavy over Savannah's cobblestone streets, thick with the scent of magnolia and jasmine. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright adjusted her straw hat, its wide brim shielding her eyes from the relentless Georgia sun. A gaggle of tourists trailed behind her, their faces a mix of anticipation and sunburn. Amy smiled, her Southern drawl as sweet as peach cobbler.

"Welcome, y'all," she greeted them, gesturing towards the grand Victorian mansion looming ahead. "This here's the Mercer Williams House, made famous by that best-selling book, 'Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil.'"

A shiver ran down Amy's spine despite the heat.  It wasn't just the humidity; this house held a darkness deeper than its moss-draped oaks. She knew its secrets better than anyone, having grown up just a few blocks away. Secrets whispered in the wind, hidden behind peeling paint and cracked windowpanes. Secrets she couldn't share with her eager audience, not without risking the wrath of generations past.
