Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Watchtower Three, blurring the lights of the sprawling Undercity below into a shimmering, nauseating mess. The wind howled like a starved beast, rattling the rusted metal struts that held the tower precariously aloft. Inside, Thaddeus Quillworth, his threadbare uniform smelling faintly of stale sweat and burnt oil, shivered despite the brazier crackling in the corner. His gaze flickered between the ever-shifting cityscape and the heavy iron door barring entry to the winding stairwell leading down into the Undercity's heart.

He gripped his rusty halberd tighter, its worn haft smooth beneath his calloused fingers. It offered little comfort against the growing unease gnawing at him. Tonight felt different, charged with a palpable tension he hadn't sensed in his five years guarding this lonely post. A feeling that something was about to break.
