Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's chiropractic clinic, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging in the window. The air inside was thick with the scent of liniment and lavender, struggling to mask the underlying musk of damp wool from Elias's perpetually soaked coat. He stared out at the storm, his brow furrowed. A Tuesday night downpour like this meant cancellations – no one wanted to brave the flooded streets just to get their back cracked.

Elias sighed, the sound lost in the drumming of rain. He wasn't complaining, not exactly. Slow nights gave him time to catch up on paperwork, organize charts, and maybe even sneak in a chapter or two of his latest mystery novel. Still, there was a pang of loneliness that always accompanied these quiet evenings.  He longed for the bustle of patients, the grateful smiles after he’d eased their pain, the feeling of making a tangible difference in people's lives.
