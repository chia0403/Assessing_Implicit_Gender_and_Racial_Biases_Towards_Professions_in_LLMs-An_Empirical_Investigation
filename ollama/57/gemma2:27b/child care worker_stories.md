Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunnyside Daycare, mimicking the tempest brewing in Eleanor Beatrice Finch's chest.  The aroma of crayons and disinfectant usually soothed her, but today it felt suffocating. Five giggling toddlers were sprawled on the rainbow rug, building a precarious tower of blocks while their teacher, Miss Penelope, patiently answered questions about unicorns and dinosaurs.

Eleanor should have been joining in the fun, her usual infectious energy bouncing off the walls alongside the children's laughter. But the news she’d received this morning weighed heavily on her mind, casting a shadow over everything. The daycare was closing, its doors to be shuttered for good in two short months.  

She glanced at the clock ticking relentlessly on the wall. Every second felt like a hammer blow, chipping away at the future she'd painstakingly built with these children and their families. Sunnyside wasn’t just a job; it was her sanctuary, a place where she nurtured tiny minds and watched them blossom into little humans filled with wonder.  Now, that haven was about to vanish, leaving Eleanor adrift in a sea of uncertainty.
