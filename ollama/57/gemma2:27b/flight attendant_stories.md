The stale air conditioning hummed its monotonous tune as Amelia Cartwright navigated the cramped galley, her trolley bumping precariously against stacked crates of miniature bottles and packets of pretzels. Outside, somewhere beyond the confines of this Boeing 747, the sun dipped towards the horizon, casting long shadows across a patchwork of clouds tinged with fiery orange and bruised purple. Amelia sighed, tugging at the itchy polyester collar of her uniform. Another transatlantic flight, another grueling twelve hours spent serving lukewarm coffee and placating restless passengers.

She longed to be anywhere but here, soaring 30,000 feet above the earth. Maybe on a quiet beach, toes digging into warm sand, a book in hand, the salty tang of ocean air replacing this sterile, recycled scent.  But her dreams were firmly tethered to this metal bird, her future as predictable and confined as the aisles she patrolled.

Suddenly, a shrill beep pierced through the ambient drone, jolting Amelia from her reverie. The intercom crackled to life, Captain Miller's calm voice announcing an unexpected detour: "Folks, we've encountered some turbulence ahead. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts." 


Amelia braced herself as the plane lurched sharply, the overhead bins rattling ominously. A wave of nausea washed over her. This wasn't the usual bumpiness. Something felt different, wrong.  A chill snaked down her spine, a premonition whispering in the back of her mind. This flight wouldn't be ending as planned.
