Above him, the roof of the old textile mill groaned, threatening to collapse under the relentless assault of flames. Eli surveyed the scene before him â€“ twisted metal girders silhouetted against the inferno, terrified faces peering from windows on the upper floors.

The setting: An abandoned textile mill in a decaying industrial district just outside Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The year is 2035, and despite advances in fire safety technology, blazes like this still occur, fueled by years of accumulated dust and flammable materials. The atmosphere is thick with tension and the deafening roar of the fire.
