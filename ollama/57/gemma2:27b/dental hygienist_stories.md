The whirring drill echoed off the sterile white walls of Dr. Thompson's office, a rhythmic counterpoint to Amelia Rose Cartwright's steady hand as she polished Mrs. Higgins' molars. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the dental instruments laid out on the tray beside her.

Amelia wasn't a dentist, but she knew teeth like an artist knew their canvas.  She could spot the telltale signs of grinding, the subtle discoloration hinting at years of coffee abuse, the slight misalignment that whispered of childhood orthodontics gone awry. Her patients, mostly denizens of sleepy Oakhaven, trusted her keen eye and gentle touch. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickly unease tightened in Amelia's chest as she noticed a new patient scheduled for the afternoon â€“ someone simply listed as "Mr. X." No address, no insurance information, just a name that sent a shiver down her spine.  As Mrs. Higgins beamed at her reflection, Amelia couldn't help but wonder who this mysterious Mr. X was, and what secrets his smile might hold.
