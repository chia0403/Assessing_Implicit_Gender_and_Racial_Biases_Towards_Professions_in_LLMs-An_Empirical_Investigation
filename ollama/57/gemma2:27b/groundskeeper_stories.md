The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and damp earth, a cloying sweetness that Elias Thorne both loved and loathed. It was the smell of his life, ever-present in this sprawling Victorian garden he tended with an almost religious devotion. Sunlight dappled through ancient oak branches, illuminating swirling dust motes and painting emerald shadows on the manicured lawns.  

Elias knelt amongst beds of lavender, meticulously snipping stray blooms with a pair of rusted shears. He could hear the muffled sounds of life beyond the wrought iron gates - children's laughter from the nearby park, the distant rumble of a delivery truck. Yet here, within these emerald walls, time seemed to slow, held captive by the relentless rhythm of seasons and the quiet symphony of nature. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Elias's spine. The air was still, unnaturally so. Even the birdsong had fallen silent. As he straightened, a flash of movement in the shadows beneath the ancient oak caught his eye. And for the first time in all his years tending this garden, Elias felt a tremor of fear crawl up his throat.
