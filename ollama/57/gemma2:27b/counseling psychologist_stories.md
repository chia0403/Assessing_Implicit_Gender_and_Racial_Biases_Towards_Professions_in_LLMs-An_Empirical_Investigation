Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her chest. The plush armchair opposite her desk sat empty, an unwelcome symbol of the cancellation that had just arrived via text – her third this week.  Evelyn ran a hand through her auburn curls, frustration tightening its grip. Starting her own practice had felt like a leap into freedom after years in a rigid hospital setting, but lately, it felt more like leaping into a void. 

The cozy office, nestled in a historic building overlooking the bustling marketplace of Charleston, South Carolina, usually exuded warmth and tranquility. Sunlight streamed through stained glass windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The aroma of lavender and sandalwood wafted from the diffuser, attempting to soothe frayed nerves. But today, even the comforting scent seemed lost amidst Evelyn's anxieties.  She longed for the days when her schedule was overflowing, when she felt like she was truly making a difference.

But with each cancelled appointment, doubt crept in – was she not good enough? Did her clients sense something amiss? The weight of her own unresolved issues pressed down on her, threatening to suffocate the passion that had once burned so brightly.
