The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Hawthorne's head as she sifted through files, each one representing another life teetering on the edge. The air in her cramped office at the Department of Corrections was stale and thick with desperation. Outside, the rumble of the city pressed against the grimy windows - a cacophony of car horns, distant sirens, and the ever-present murmur of urban life. Amelia took a deep breath, trying to center herself amidst the chaos. Today was parole hearing day for her most challenging case yet: Marcus Alvarez, convicted of armed robbery and facing a possible five years behind bars.

Amelia had met with Marcus several times over the past six months. He was young, barely twenty-two, with haunted eyes that spoke of a troubled past. He'd shown remorse for his actions, but Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. There were inconsistencies in his story, flashes of anger that erupted without warning. As she prepared to face the parole board, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. This case felt different, and Amelia knew that whatever decision she helped make today could have far-reaching consequences.
