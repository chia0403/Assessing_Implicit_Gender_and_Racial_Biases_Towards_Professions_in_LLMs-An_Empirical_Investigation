The air in "Curl Up & Dye" buzzed with the electric hum of hairdryers and the lively chatter of regulars. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone street of Notting Hill, painting the pastel-colored houses in hues of burnt orange and dusky rose. Beatrice Evelyn Beaumont, known affectionately to her clients as "Bea," expertly snipped away at a tangle of fiery red curls, humming along to Blondie blasting from the salon speakers.  

Bea was a whirlwind of energy, with bright green eyes that sparkled behind her tortoiseshell glasses and a mane of untamed auburn hair perpetually escaping its braid. She moved through the salon with the grace of a dancer, weaving between chairs, refilling coffee cups, and offering words of encouragement to her clients, all while making each haircut feel like a work of art. 

Today was different though.  A tension hung in the air, thick as the cloud of hairspray that lingered above Bea's head. A stranger sat perched in her chair, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. This wasn't unusual for Notting Hill, a neighborhood teeming with eccentrics and artists seeking refuge from the world. But something about this client felt off, their silence unnerving amidst the usual salon chatter.  

Bea finished trimming the last stray curl and looked up into the strangerâ€™s face. Their eyes were hidden behind dark sunglasses, but Bea could sense a gaze that pierced through her, unsettlingly intense.
