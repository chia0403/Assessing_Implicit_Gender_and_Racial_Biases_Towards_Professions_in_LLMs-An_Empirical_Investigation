Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street.  The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and despair, a noxious blend Elias had come to consider his signature scent.  He sat hunched over his cluttered desk, a half-empty bottle of whiskey sweating beside a stack of dusty files. The photograph on his desk, a faded image of a woman with laughing eyes and fiery red hair, seemed to mock him. It had been five years since Amelia had left, vanished without a trace.

The insistent buzzing of the office phone startled him. He grabbed it, gruffly answering, "Thorne Investigations." The voice on the other end was husky, urgent, tinged with desperation. 


"Mr. Thorne? My name is Vivian Hayes... I need your help. It's about my husband..."

Elias leaned back in his chair, the springs groaning in protest.  He poured himself another shot of whiskey, swirling it thoughtfully. He had a feeling this case was going to be anything but lucky.
