The midday sun beat down on Alistair Finch's neck, turning his skin the color of a well-done lobster. Sweat stung his eyes as he maneuvered across the steep incline of Mrs. Henderson's roof.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh glare reflecting off the shingles. Below him, the bustling streets of Brooklyn stretched out like a wrinkled patchwork quilt.

Alistair wasn't afraid of heights, but he was starting to regret agreeing to this particular job. The roof was old, riddled with cracks and soft spots, making each step a calculated risk. A gust of wind whistled through the eaves, sending a shiver down his spine. He gripped the edge tighter, wishing for a moment that he'd chosen carpentry like his brother.

He heard the muffled clang of Mrs. Henderson's front door bell from above the din of traffic. "Must be her neighbor coming to check on me," Alistair muttered, wiping his brow with a grimy handkerchief. He glanced at the pile of shingles stacked precariously near the edge, wondering if he could get them all secured before lunchtime.

But then, something caught his eye. A glint of metal protruding from beneath a loose shingle. It wasn't a nail, Alistair knew that much. Curiosity gnawed at him. He carefully pried up the shingle, revealing a small, ornate silver locket nestled in the tar.  Alistair's pulse quickened. He brushed off the dirt and grime, his fingers tracing the delicate engravings on its surface. What secrets did this forgotten treasure hold?
