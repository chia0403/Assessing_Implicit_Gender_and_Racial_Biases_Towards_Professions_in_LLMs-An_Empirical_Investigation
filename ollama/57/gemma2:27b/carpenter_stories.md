The sawdust danced in the morning light slanting through the open workshop door, swirling like tiny, iridescent snowflakes against the weathered wooden floorboards. Elias Blackwood squinted at the intricate pattern he was carving into a mahogany table leg - a delicate vine crawling with minuscule blooms. The rhythmic rasp of his chisel filled the air, punctuated by the occasional thunk as he tapped it home with a mallet. Outside, the rooster crowed from Mrs. Henderson's farm down the road, a sharp counterpoint to the gentle symphony Elias conducted with his tools.

He lived in Oakhaven, a sleepy village nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering forests in the heart of Vermont. The air always smelled faintly of pine needles and woodsmoke, and the sound of birdsong was a constant backdrop to life. Elias' workshop, a converted barn perched on the edge of town, was his sanctuary. Here, surrounded by the scent of cedar and oak, he could lose himself in the language of wood â€“ its grain, its knots, its inherent beauty waiting to be unveiled.
