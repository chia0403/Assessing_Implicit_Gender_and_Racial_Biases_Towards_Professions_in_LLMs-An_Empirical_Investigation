Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Taxes & Troubles," blurring the neon sign into an indecipherable smear. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl back under her faded blue beret. The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of the ancient typewriter she affectionately called "Big Bertha."

Eleanor wasn't your typical tax preparer. With her penchant for vintage clothing and her sharp wit honed from years navigating the labyrinthine world of IRS regulations, she was more akin to a financial detective. Her clientele, a motley crew of artists, freelancers, and small-business owners, often arrived with a tangled web of receipts, crumpled invoices, and a healthy dose of anxiety.  

Today, however, was different. The usual trickle of last-minute filers had dried up, leaving Eleanor staring at the blank page in front of her. Big Bertha seemed to mock her with its impatient click-clacking. A storm raged outside, mirroring the brewing unease in Eleanor's heart.  Something felt off, a disharmony in the air thicker than the cigarette smoke curling from Mr. Goldberg's perpetually lit pipe in the corner.
