Rain lashed against the warped windowpane of Eleanor Grace Cartwright's tiny treatment room. The rhythmic drumming was almost soothing, but it did little to calm the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach.  She glanced at the clock for the hundredth time â€“ 6:57 pm. Her last appointment of the day was running seven minutes late, and Eleanor hated being kept waiting.

The treatment room, nestled within a bustling wellness center downtown, was a haven of serenity she'd painstakingly curated. Scented candles flickered softly on a side table, casting warm shadows across the bamboo flooring. The air hummed with the gentle sound of a tabletop fountain, its cool mist adding to the tranquil atmosphere. Eleanor normally found solace in this space, but tonight, the tension was palpable.  

The door finally creaked open at 6:59 pm, revealing a tall, gaunt figure silhouetted against the dim hallway light. Eleanor forced a smile. "Good evening," she said, her voice betraying none of the impatience simmering beneath the surface. "Welcome to Serenity Spa. I'm Eleanor Cartwright."
