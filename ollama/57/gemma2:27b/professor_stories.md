Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of Professor Eleanor Vance's study, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  The scent of old books and pipe tobacco usually soothed her, but tonight it did little to calm the churning in her stomach. Stacks of parchment lay scattered across her mahogany desk, each one a testament to the hours she'd spent poring over archaic texts, searching for an answer that seemed forever out of reach. Outside, the wind howled through the ancient oaks lining the cobblestone path leading to Blackwood Manor, her secluded home perched atop the craggy Yorkshire moors.  Eleanor gripped the armrest of her worn leather chair, knuckles white against the faded crimson. She had dedicated her life to unraveling the mysteries of forgotten languages and lost civilizations, but this puzzle, hidden within a crumbling codex she'd recently acquired, felt impossibly intricate. It spoke of a ritual, a convergence, a power long dormant... a power that Eleanor feared might be awakening.
