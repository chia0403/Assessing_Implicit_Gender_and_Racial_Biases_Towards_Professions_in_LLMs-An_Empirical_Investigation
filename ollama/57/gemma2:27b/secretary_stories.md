Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Sterling & Thorne Insurance, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into an indistinct smear of red. Eleanor Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles, wincing as a particularly aggressive gust rattled the window frame. It was Tuesday, 3:47 pm, and the office held all the vibrancy of a tomb. Mr. Sterling, with his perpetually furrowed brow and tendency to bark orders like a rabid terrier, had vanished hours ago. Ms. Thorne, thankfully, was on holiday in Mallorca, leaving Eleanor alone to grapple with the mountains of paperwork threatening to engulf her desk.  

Eleanor sighed, pushing a wayward strand of auburn hair back into its bun. The silence, broken only by the rhythmic clattering of the rain and the insistent tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, was unnerving. It felt as though the very walls were closing in on her, their faded floral wallpaper whispering secrets she couldn't decipher.  

Just then, a sharp rap at the door startled Eleanor upright. The visitor stood silhouetted against the dim light of the hallway â€“ tall, shrouded in a long coat, and holding a briefcase that looked suspiciously heavy.
