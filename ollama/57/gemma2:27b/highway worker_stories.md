The sun beat down on Silas Montgomery's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his skin red under the brim of his faded Stetson. Sweat stung his eyes as he wrestled with the rusted bolts securing the "Road Work Ahead" sign. It was always the same damn thing – rusty bolts, cracked asphalt, and drivers who thought speed limits were mere suggestions. 

Silas surveyed the sprawling stretch of Nevada highway before him. The endless ribbon of blacktop shimmered in the heat haze, flanked by scrubby desert vegetation that offered little shade. In the distance, a lone hawk circled lazily overhead, its keen eyes scanning for prey.  

Today was supposed to be a routine repaving job, but Silas knew from experience that "routine" rarely applied on this stretch of highway. Anything could happen out here – blown tires, runaway semis, even the occasional lost hiker stumbling onto the asphalt in search of civilization. 

As he finally loosened the last stubborn bolt, Silas sighed and wiped his brow with a greasy rag. Maybe today would be different. Maybe today, nothing unexpected would happen. But deep down, he knew that on this lonely stretch of Nevada highway, something always did.
