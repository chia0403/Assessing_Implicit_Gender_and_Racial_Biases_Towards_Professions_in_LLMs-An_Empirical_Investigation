The midday sun beat down on the dusty courtyard of Elias Thorne's workshop, making the granite slabs shimmer like molten gold. Sweat beaded on Elias' brow as he chipped away at a particularly stubborn block, sending sparks flying from his hammer blows. The air was thick with the scent of stone dust and oiled steel. Around him, half-finished statues lay in various stages of completion â€“ a reclining nymph frozen mid-sigh, a stern-faced warrior clutching a broken sword, a delicate hummingbird poised for flight.

Elias paused, wiping his forehead with a grimy rag. He surveyed his work with a critical eye, the sculptor's instinct tugging at him to refine the curve of the nymph's hip, to deepen the warrior's frown lines. But hunger gnawed at his belly and the afternoon market would soon be closing.

He sheathed his chisel, the familiar weight settling comfortably against his thigh. "Time for sustenance," he muttered to himself, slinging a leather bag over his shoulder.
