Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Finch's workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of sound. The air hung heavy with the scent of ozone and burnt solder, a familiar comfort to Elias. He ran a calloused hand through his greying hair, squinting at the tangle of wires splayed across his workbench. It was supposed to be a simple rewiring job for Mrs. Henderson's antique lamp, but something wasn't adding up. The wiring diagram in his worn leather-bound notebook contradicted the actual configuration. Elias sighed, pushing his safety glasses further up his nose. 

Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the electrical tempest brewing within the lamp's faded brass casing. This wasn't just a faulty wire; something feltâ€¦off. Like a hum beneath his fingertips, a current of something beyond electricity. Elias, a man who prided himself on logic and precision, found himself inexplicably drawn to unravel this mystery.

Little did he know that Mrs. Henderson's lamp held secrets older than the cobbled streets of his seaside town, secrets that would plunge him into a world where the lines between science and magic blurred like the flickering light of a dying bulb.
