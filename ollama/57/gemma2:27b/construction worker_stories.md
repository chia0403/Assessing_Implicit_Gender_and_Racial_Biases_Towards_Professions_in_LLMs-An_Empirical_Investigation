The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Ramirez's neck as he wrestled a length of rebar into place. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy outline of downtown Phoenix. The air hung heavy and still, thick with the scent of dust and diesel fumes. Eli grunted, muscles straining against the weight, then secured the metal rod with a practiced clang of his hammer. 

He surveyed the skeletal framework rising from the desert floor - the bones of what would soon be a gleaming new skyscraper. A pang of pride hit him; he loved seeing these structures take shape, brick by brick, beam by beam. But today, even the satisfaction of building felt dulled. A knot of worry tightened in his chest, refusing to loosen. His daughter Isabella was graduating high school tonight, and he wouldn't be there. 

Eli wiped his brow with a calloused hand, remembering the phone call from the foreman earlier that week.  "We need all hands on deck," the gruff voice had barked. "Double shift till Friday. Deadline's looming." Eli sighed. Double shift meant missing Isabellaâ€™s graduation ceremony. A ceremony he'd promised himself and his daughter he wouldn't miss for anything.
