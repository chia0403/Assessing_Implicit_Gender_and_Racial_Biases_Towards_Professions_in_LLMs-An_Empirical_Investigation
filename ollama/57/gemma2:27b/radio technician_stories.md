The fluorescent lights hummed in the cramped repair shop, casting a sickly green glow over Evelyn "Eve" Thorne's workbench. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the single, naked bulb hanging above her head. The scent of solder and burnt electronics hung heavy, a familiar perfume that Eve had come to associate with both comfort and frustration. Today was leaning towards the latter.

Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly on the ramshackle building housing "Eve's Ear," her struggling radio repair shop. Cars whizzed by on Route 66, their horns blaring a symphony of urban chaos that Eve usually found soothing. But today, the insistent beeping of an antique Zenith console radio she was trying to resurrect only served to amplify her headache.

The Zenith was a relic from a bygone era, its wooden casing scratched and faded, but with intricate details hinting at its former grandeur. It had been brought in by a melancholic old man who spoke of memories tied to the radio's crackling broadcasts - stories of wartime news, family gatherings, and the dulcet tones of Frank Sinatra. Eve, ever the sentimentalist, had vowed to breathe life back into the machine, but it was proving to be a stubborn patient.

She sighed, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her grease-stained hand. The problem lay somewhere in the vacuum tubes, she suspected, but pinpointing the culprit felt like searching for a needle in a haystack.  Eve needed to focus. This wasn't just any repair; it was a chance to reconnect a man with his past, a responsibility she took seriously.
