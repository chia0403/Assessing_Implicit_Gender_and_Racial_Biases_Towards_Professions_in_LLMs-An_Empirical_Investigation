The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and simmering garlic as Esmeralda "Esme" Moreau whisked a creamy b√©chamel sauce. Outside, the Parisian dawn was just breaking, painting the sky in hues of rose and lavender. Esme's small kitchen, tucked away on a cobblestone street in Montmartre, buzzed with pre-dawn activity. The rhythmic clatter of knives against cutting boards mingled with the gentle hiss of butter melting in a pan.

Today was market day, the highlight of Esme's week. She loved the vibrant chaos: the vendors hawking their wares, the scent of fresh bread and ripe fruit filling the air, the camaraderie amongst fellow cooks haggling over prices and sharing culinary secrets. It was her chance to source the freshest ingredients for her tiny bistro, "Le Petit Coin," a haven for locals seeking Esme's soulful, homestyle cooking.
