The humid air hung heavy in The Blooming Thistle, thick with the perfume of lilies, roses, and gardenias. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes that danced above Penelope Hawthorne's workbench. Penelope, her auburn hair escaping its braid and dusted with pollen, meticulously arranged a cascade of crimson roses against vibrant green ferns. Outside, on cobblestone Mulberry Street, the morning bustle was just beginning – delivery carts rattled by, vendors hawked their wares, and children chased pigeons through the square. 

But within The Blooming Thistle, all was still except for Penelope's rhythmic snip-snip of shears and the soft sigh of the old ceiling fan overhead. Today was particularly important; the annual Founders’ Day Ball was tonight, and Penelope had been commissioned to create the centerpiece for the Mayor's table. It was a challenge she relished, but one that carried a weight of expectation she felt keenly in her chest.
