The scent of aged paper and leather hung thick in the air, a comforting shroud for Eleanor Beatrice Finch as she straightened the already impeccably aligned spines on the "Folklore and Mythology" shelf. Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Willow Creek Library, blurring the view of the cobblestone street outside. The rhythmic drumming seemed to echo the steady pulse of Eleanor's own heart, a counterpoint to the occasional creak of the ancient building settling around her. Today, like most days, she was alone in this haven of words and forgotten stories.

Eleanor preferred it that way. Not because she disliked people, but because the whispers of history and imagination trapped between the pages spoke louder to her than any living voice. Here, amidst the hushed rows of towering bookshelves and the faint glow emanating from antique reading lamps, she felt truly at home.
