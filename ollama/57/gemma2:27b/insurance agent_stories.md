The air hung thick with humidity, even in the dimly lit office.  Outside, cicadas thrummed their relentless chorus, a soundtrack to Elijah Blackwood's mounting frustration. He tugged at his tie, loosening it a notch, and stared at the file splayed across his desk.

"Mrs. Eleanor Finch," he read aloud, tracing the name with his fingertip. "Policy number 4782-K. Cause of claim: spontaneous combustion."  Elijah scoffed. Spontaneous combustion? He'd been in this business long enough to know that most claims were straightforward - car accidents, house fires, stolen jewelry. But Mrs. Finch's caseâ€¦ it smelled fishy.

His office, tucked away on the second floor of a nondescript brick building in downtown Charleston, was about as far from exciting as one could get. The beige walls and worn carpet whispered tales of countless insurance claims reviewed, policies scrutinized, and clients appeased (or not). But today, Elijah found himself drawn into a mystery that threatened to shake his world - and possibly Mrs. Finch's afterlife.
