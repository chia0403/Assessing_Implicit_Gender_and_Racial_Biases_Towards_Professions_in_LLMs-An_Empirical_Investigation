Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the law office, blurring the neon glow of the "Davenport & Finch" sign across the street. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright hunched over a stack of documents, her brow furrowed in concentration. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Amelia wasn't exactly thrilled to be working late on a Friday night, especially with a storm raging outside, but she knew the case rested on her shoulders. 

Davenport & Finch specialized in the downtrodden - the wrongfully accused, the victims of corporate greed, those whose voices were rarely heard. Amelia loved this work, even when it meant sacrificing sleep and social life. But tonight was different.

The prosecution's case seemed airtight, but Amelia had a nagging feeling that there was more to the story. A hunch, maybe, or perhaps just the exhaustion talking. But she couldn't shake the conviction that something crucial was missing.
