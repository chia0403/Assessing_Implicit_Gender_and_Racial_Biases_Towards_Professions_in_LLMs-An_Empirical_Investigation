Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Alistair Finch’s dental practice, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of the approaching storm. The waiting room, usually abuzz with nervous chatter and the scent of antiseptic, was unnervingly silent. Only the ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner dared interrupt the rhythmic downpour. Alistair sighed, running a hand through his already disheveled silver hair. He hadn't seen a patient all day – a consequence of the torrential rain that had crippled the small coastal town of Oakhaven. 

He glanced at the appointment book, its pages as empty as the streets outside. His stomach rumbled with hunger, reminding him he hadn't eaten since breakfast. Perhaps he should head home early and enjoy a cup of tea by the fire. Just then, a sharp rapping on the front door startled him. Alistair rose from his chair, curiosity piqued. Who would be out in this weather?
