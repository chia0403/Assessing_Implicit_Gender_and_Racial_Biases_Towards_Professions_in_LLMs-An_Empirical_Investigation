The neon glow of the "Dusty's Diner" sign buzzed like a restless fly trapped under glass. It pierced the heavy desert night, casting long, skeletal shadows from the rusted hulks of abandoned cars lining the gravel lot.  

Jeremiah "Red" Callahan eased his rig, a Peterbilt 379 affectionately named "The Iron Horse," into an empty space near the diner's entrance. The engine ticked and groaned as it cooled, its rhythmic sigh a lullaby in the stillness. Red stretched, his joints popping like firecrackers after hours crammed behind the wheel. He tugged at the brim of his faded Stetson, revealing a face weathered by sun and wind, etched with lines that spoke of countless miles traversed and untold stories witnessed.  

He stepped down onto the dusty ground, the boots he'd worn for a decade crunching underfoot. Tonight, Red craved nothing more than a plate of Dusty's legendary chili fries and a steaming mug of black coffee strong enough to strip paint. But as he trudged toward the diner's entrance, a flicker of unease snaked through him. The usual clatter of late-night truckers sharing stories and laughter was absent. Only an eerie silence hung in the air, broken only by the mournful whine of the wind whipping through the desolate landscape.
