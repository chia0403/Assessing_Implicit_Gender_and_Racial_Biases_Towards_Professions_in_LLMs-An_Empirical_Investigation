Rain lashed against the windows of Elias Hawthorne's tiny office, blurring the already dreary view of the abandoned textile mill across the street. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp carpet and stale coffee. Elias sighed, running a hand through his greying hair. He hadn't closed a deal in weeks, and the growing stack of bills on his desk seemed to mock him with every gust of wind that rattled the office windowpane. 

Elias was a man built for brighter days – tall and lean, with eyes the color of a summer sky and a smile that could charm birds from trees. But lately, even he struggled to find the sunshine within himself. Milltown, once a bustling hub of industry, had fallen into a deep slumber, its factories shuttered and its residents drifting away in search of opportunity. Selling houses here felt like trying to sell sand in the Sahara – an impossible task with little hope for reward.


He glanced at the clock, its hands stubbornly pointed towards 4:00 pm. Closing time. Elias slumped back in his chair, defeated. Maybe tomorrow would be better. Or maybe Milltown was destined to remain a ghost town, forever haunted by the echoes of its past.
