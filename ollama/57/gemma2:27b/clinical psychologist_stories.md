Rain lashed against the windowpane of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, mimicking the turbulent emotions churning within her patient. The dimly lit room, usually a haven of calm with its plush armchair and flickering fireplace, felt suffocating tonight.  Evelyn, known for her gentle demeanor and unwavering empathy, found herself unusually on edge. Across from her sat Amelia Thorne, a young woman whose haunted eyes mirrored the storm raging outside. Amelia clutched a worn photograph – a faded image of a laughing child with auburn curls mirroring Amelia's own. "It's been ten years," Amelia whispered, her voice brittle. "Ten years since I last saw my sister." 


The scent of rain and woodsmoke lingered in the air, a peculiar blend Evelyn had grown accustomed to in her secluded cabin nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains.  She knew Amelia’s story was far from ordinary; whispers of a disappearance shrouded in mystery and tinged with local folklore had reached even her isolated practice. But as Amelia's trembling fingers tightened around the photograph, Evelyn felt a chilling certainty - this case held secrets darker than any legend she'd ever heard.
