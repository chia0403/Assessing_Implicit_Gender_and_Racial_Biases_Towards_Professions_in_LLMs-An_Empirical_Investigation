The humid Georgia air hung thick with the scent of magnolia and freshly cut grass as Elias "Eli" Blackwood knelt, carefully coaxing a stubborn azalea bush back into its trellis. Sweat beaded on his forehead, tracing paths through the grime ingrained from years of working under the unforgiving sun. His calloused hands, though gentle now, were testament to countless hours spent wrestling with unruly branches and battling invasive weeds. 

Eli wasn't just any landscaper; he was an artist who molded nature into breathtaking canvases. He saw beauty in every twisted root, every delicate bloom, and found solace in the silent communion between man and earth. But today, his usual sense of peace was fractured by a nagging unease. The old Blackwood estate had been his family's legacy for generations, passed down through bloodlines entwined with the soil itself. Yet, lately, something felt amiss, a subtle shift in the air that whispered of forgotten secrets and dormant dangers.
