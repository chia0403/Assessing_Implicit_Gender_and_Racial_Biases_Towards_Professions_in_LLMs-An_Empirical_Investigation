Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thornwood's cramped cubicle, mimicking the hammering anxiety in his chest. Outside, the city of Veridium throbbed with neon life, a stark contrast to the stale air and flickering fluorescent lights that illuminated his drafting table.

He dreamt of contributing to its soaring skyline, of seeing his designs etched into the city's very fabric. Yet, here he was, stuck on a menial task for a faceless corporation, his ambitions teetering on the precipice of despair.
