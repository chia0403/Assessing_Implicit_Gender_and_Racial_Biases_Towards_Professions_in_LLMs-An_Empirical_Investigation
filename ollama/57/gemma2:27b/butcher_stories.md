The stench of iron and rosemary hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet, cloying aroma of curing salt. Bartholomew “Bart” Higgins, his apron stained crimson like a battlefield, expertly cleaved through a side of beef. The rhythmic thud of the cleaver against bone was a lullaby he knew by heart, a sound that resonated deep within him, echoing generations past. 

His shop, "Higgins' Butcher & Provisions," perched precariously on the edge of the cobbled market square in the ancient town of Oakhaven. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating shelves stacked high with sausages, hams cured to a mahogany sheen, and terrines brimming with spiced meats. Bart surveyed his domain with a satisfied grunt; it was a testament to his family's legacy, a tradition passed down for centuries. 

But today, something felt different. A prickling unease settled over him as he paused mid-chop, the cleaver suspended in the air. A shadow stretched across the threshold, deeper and colder than the waning autumn sunlight allowed. Bart turned, his gaze drawn to the figure standing silently in the doorway. He couldn't quite make out their features in the gloom, but something about their presence sent a shiver down his spine.
