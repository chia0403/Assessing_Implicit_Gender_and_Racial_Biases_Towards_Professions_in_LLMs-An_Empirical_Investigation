Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke. Inside the ramshackle clinic, Amelia Blackwood, PA-C, squinted at the flickering fluorescent light above her makeshift operating table. It was barely past dusk, but the storm had plunged the village of Esperanza into an unnerving twilight.

Amelia wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, leaving a streak of grime across her forehead. The power had been out for hours, and the only illumination came from a sputtering kerosene lamp and the occasional flash of lightning that momentarily bathed the room in an ethereal glow. Her patient, a young boy named Miguel, lay pale and shivering beneath a threadbare blanket. His leg, mangled by a falling tree branch during the storm, throbbed ominously.

Amelia's heart hammered against her ribs. She had limited supplies, rudimentary equipment, and no way to contact anyone for help until the storm passed. But Miguel needed her. He needed her now.
