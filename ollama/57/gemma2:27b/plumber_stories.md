The rusted groan of aging pipes echoed through the cramped basement like a mournful symphony. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, his grease-stained overalls smelling faintly of mildew and lukewarm coffee, peered into the inky darkness beneath the ancient boiler. A single bare bulb cast long, skeletal shadows on the damp brick walls, highlighting cobwebs thick as gauze and forgotten tools gathering dust. Bart sighed, the sound swallowed by the oppressive silence. This wasn't his first rodeo with a leaky basement, but this one felt different. The air hung heavy with an unnatural chill, prickling his skin despite the summer heat above. Something about the way the pipes pulsed, the unsettling rhythm of their drip-drip-drip, made Bart uneasy.

He was in an old Victorian house on Elm Street, its peeling paint and overgrown ivy whispering tales of forgotten grandeur. The homeowner, Mrs. Eleanor Cavendish, a woman with eyes as sharp as shattered glass, hovered anxiously by the top of the stairs, her bony fingers twisting a silver locket. "Are you sure you can fix it, Mr. Higgins?" she rasped, her voice brittle like autumn leaves.

Bart straightened, his weathered face determined. He'd faced worse than leaky pipes in his thirty years as a plumber â€“ clogged sewer lines, burst water mains, even the occasional angry raccoon trapped in a vent. This wouldn't be any different. Or so he hoped.
