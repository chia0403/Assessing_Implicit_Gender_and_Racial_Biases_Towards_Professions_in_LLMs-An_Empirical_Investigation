Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound. Dr. Elara Vance grimaced, tugging her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself. The single bulb hanging from the ceiling flickered ominously, casting long, dancing shadows across the cramped room. 

Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping up dust devils that danced along the deserted dirt road leading to Hopewell Clinic. Elara knew no one would be venturing out in this weather, not unless it was an emergency. Still, she sat perched on the edge of her rickety stool, medical bag at her feet, waiting. Waiting for a cough, a cry, a frantic knock that would break the oppressive silence and pull her back into the fray. Hopewell was a desolate outpost on the edge of the Namib Desert, where life clung stubbornly to existence amidst the unforgiving landscape. Elara had chosen this hardship, trading the comforts of a city hospital for the raw intimacy of tending to a community forgotten by the world.  

But tonight, even the whispers of the desert seemed to hold their breath, leaving Elara alone with her anxieties and the ghosts of past failures. The memory of little Musa, whose fever she hadn't been able to break, flickered in her mind's eye. She pushed it away, focusing on the rhythmic thumping of her own heart, willing herself to be ready for whatever the storm might bring.
