The air conditioning unit in Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's beat-up Toyota Corolla wheezed like an asthmatic rhinoceros. Sweat beaded on Teddy's forehead despite the icy blast from the vents, his starched white shirt clinging uncomfortably to him. He adjusted his tie – a garish shade of purple he'd bought at a discount because "it screamed confidence" – and sighed.

Outside, the sun beat down mercilessly on the asphalt jungle of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Teddy was on his way to meet Mr. Henderson, a notoriously tight-fisted owner of a chain of convenience stores, about a new line of artisanal coffee Teddy's company had developed. The brochure lay open on the passenger seat, promising "a symphony of flavor" and "ethically sourced beans."

Teddy wasn't sure if Mr. Henderson would appreciate the poetry, but he knew the man was obsessed with profit margins. This was Teddy's chance to finally break out of his sales slump – a series of unfortunate rejections that had left him questioning his career choice and wondering if he should have listened to his mother and become an accountant.

He pulled up outside Henderson's Convenience Emporium, a faded yellow building with flickering neon signs and a perpetual smell of stale hot dogs wafting from within. Taking a deep breath, Teddy grabbed the brochure and his sample case – filled with exotic coffee blends like "Midnight Mocha" and "Sunrise Sumatra" – and stepped out into the unforgiving Oklahoma heat. This was it. 

He had one shot to convince Mr. Henderson that artisanal coffee wasn't just a fad for pretentious hipsters but a genuine opportunity for increased revenue.
