Rain lashed against the warped glass of the attic window, each drop exploding in a miniature starburst. The musty air hung thick with the scent of mildew and forgotten dreams, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of Elsie Beatrice Hawthorne's ancient typewriter. Elsie, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, squinted at the jumble of receipts spread across her rickety desk.

Her fingers, gnarled and stained with ink, danced across the keys, meticulously recording every penny spent and earned by the struggling haberdashery downstairs. For decades, Elsie had been the unseen hand guiding the finances of Hawthorne & Sons, a legacy business teetering on the precipice of ruin. The once-vibrant shop, known for its exquisite tailoring and bespoke suits, now bore the weary scars of changing fashions and dwindling clientele.

Elsie knew the numbers like the back of her hand â€“ each stitch, every spool of thread, represented a delicate thread in the fabric of their existence. But tonight, even the comforting rhythm of her typing couldn't drown out the gnawing fear that clawed at her heart. The books weren't lying; Hawthorne & Sons was bleeding money, and Elsie feared she might be the last one left to witness its final breath.
