Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the rhythm of Eleanor Vance's frantic typing. The ancient typewriter, a relic her grandfather had bequeathed to her along with his dusty collection of first editions, clicked and clacked relentlessly, spitting out words onto the yellowed page clutched in the machine's maw.  Eleanor's cramped apartment, perched precariously atop a bakery in the heart of Greenwich Village, was bathed in the pale glow of a single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling. Stacks of dog-eared manuscripts threatened to topple over, their titles – "The Shadow of the Obsidian Spire," "Whispers in the Forgotten Grove" – hinting at Eleanor's penchant for gothic fantasy. Tonight, however, inspiration had deserted her.  Instead of the usual fantastical creatures and sweeping landscapes, her mind was tangled with a far more unsettling reality: a series of cryptic postcards arriving on her doorstep, each bearing a single word – "Beware," "Remember," "Coming" – scrawled in elegant, yet menacing calligraphy. 


Eleanor paused, her fingers hovering over the keys. The room felt oppressive, the silence punctuated only by the incessant drumming of rain and the distant wail of a siren. A shiver snaked down her spine. She knew she should ignore the postcards, dismiss them as the work of a misguided fan or a prankster. But something about their ominous message, their relentless arrival, gnawed at her. What was coming? And who, or what, was behind it?
