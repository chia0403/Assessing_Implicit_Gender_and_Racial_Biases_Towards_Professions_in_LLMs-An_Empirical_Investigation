Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these, when the misty veil of the Mississippi River hung low over the city like a damp shroud. Inside the worn walls of St. Anne's Hospital, Registered Nurse Alexandra "Lexi" Therese Dupre was bracing herself for another long and chaotic shift.

Lexi, with her curly dark hair and warm hazel eyes, had always found solace in the hospital's steady rhythm, where the only constant was the beeping of machines and the ebb and flow of human suffering. As a nurse on the pediatric ward, she'd seen it all â€“ from the simplest colds to the most complex surgeries. But tonight felt different, somehow. The air seemed heavier, the shadows cast by the flickering fluorescent lights twisting into ominous shapes that Lexi couldn't shake.

It was going to be one of those nights.
