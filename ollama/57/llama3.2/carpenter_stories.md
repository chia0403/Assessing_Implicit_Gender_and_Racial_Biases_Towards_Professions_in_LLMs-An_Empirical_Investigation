Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The fog rolled in off the small coastal town of Ravenswood Cove, shrouding the worn wooden docks in a damp, gray mist. Amidst the sleepy fishing village, 35-year-old Emmet Fletcher stood on the weathered deck of his family's old boat, the "Maverick's Revenge". With his calloused hands wrapped around the worn handle of his trusty toolbox, Emmet surveyed the quiet morning scene before him.

As a skilled carpenter and the son of Ravenswood Cove's beloved shipwright, Em Fletcher had grown up with a deep connection to the sea and its rhythms. His latest project, a painstaking restoration of the historic lighthouse that stood sentinel over the village, was nearing completion – but a nagging sense of unease gnawed at his gut like a rusty nail.

The wind died down, leaving an oppressive stillness in its wake. A faint smell of saltwater and decay wafted from the mist-shrouded water, carrying with it whispers of secrets and stories long forgotten. As Em Fletcher gazed out into the foggy expanse, he felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle with a growing sense of foreboding – as if something was stirring beneath the surface, just beyond the reach of his weathered eyes.

And yet, it was this very moment that would change everything for Emmet Fletcher. The darkness gathering in the fog seemed to whisper a single word: "wait."
