Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a writer as the main character:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished stone as Emilia Faye MacLeod stepped out of her small flat on Victoria Street, a shiver running down her spine. The fog crept in off the North Sea, curling around the city's ancient buildings like a damp mist. It was the kind of evening that made you want to stay indoors with a cup of tea and a good book, but Emilia had already committed to meeting her friend, Dr. Sophia Patel, at the Writers' Circle meeting at the Royal Lyceum.

As she walked towards the theatre, the sound of raindrops hitting the pavement created a symphony that was both melancholy and exhilarating. The city's writers were gathering tonight to share their latest works-in-progress, and Emilia had promised herself that this would be the night she finally found the courage to read her own manuscript aloud. It was a daunting prospect, one that had haunted her for months.

Emilia took a deep breath of the damp air and pushed open the door to the Lyceum. The warm glow of the stage lights enveloped her like a hug, banishing some of the self-doubt that had been plaguing her all week. She knew that tonight was about more than just sharing her writing – it was about finding her voice again, and rediscovering why she'd ever become a writer in the first place.

As she made her way through the crowd of writers, chatting with familiar faces and exchanging nervous glances with those who were new to the circle, Emilia felt a thrill of anticipation. This could be the night that changed everything – or it could be the one that left her wondering if she was truly cut out for this writing business after all.
