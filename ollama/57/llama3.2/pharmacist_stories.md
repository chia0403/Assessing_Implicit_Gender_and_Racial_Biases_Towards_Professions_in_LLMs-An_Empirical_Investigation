Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the small town of Willow Creek, Indiana, pharmacist Emilia Joy Everett began her evening routine at her family-owned pharmacy, Everett's Apothecary. The soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the rows of shelves stacked with jars of dried herbs and bottles of prescription medications.

Outside, a light drizzle had begun to fall, casting a misty veil over the quaint Main Street, where the old oak trees creaked and groaned in the gentle breeze. The town was quiet, save for the occasional chirp from a cricket or the distant rumble of the highway. It was just before 5 PM on a typical Wednesday afternoon, the time when the locals had finished their lunch breaks and were winding down until dinner.

Emilia, with her curly brown hair tied back in a ponytail and her wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose, sorted through the day's receipts, making sure everything was accurate before locking up for the night. She took pride in being meticulous about every aspect of running the pharmacy, from managing inventory to ensuring that every patient left with their prescription filled to their exact specifications.

As she finished up and turned off the lights, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. It had been an odd day, with several patients complaining of strange side effects from certain medications, and a mysterious phone call earlier in the afternoon from someone claiming to be a "sister" who needed urgent assistance with a prescription. Now, as she locked up and headed out into the evening, Emilia couldn't help but wonder what secrets her quiet town might be hiding.

How's that?
