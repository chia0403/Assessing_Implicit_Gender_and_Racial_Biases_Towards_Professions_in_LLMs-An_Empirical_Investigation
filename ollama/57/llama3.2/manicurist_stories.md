As the sun set over the tranquil streets of Kyoto's Gion district, Emiko Nakahara wiped down her station at the family-owned nail salon, "Sakura & Co.", with a practiced motion. The soft glow of the lanterns outside cast a warm light on the rows of neatly organized nail polish bottles and the gentle hum of conversation from the other clients in the waiting area.

At 25 years old, Emiko had spent years perfecting her craft as a skilled manicurist, known for her delicate touch and attention to detail. She took pride in making every client feel like royalty, whether it was a young bride-to-be preening for her wedding day or a retired salaryman seeking solace from the stresses of modern life.

As she finished cleaning up, Emiko's thoughts turned to the unusual request she had received earlier that day - a mysterious woman who had asked to be seated in the back room, requesting a special treatment that went beyond the usual polish and pedicure. The woman's words had been shrouded in secrecy, but Emiko's curiosity was piqued. Who was this enigmatic client, and what did she want from Sakura & Co.?
