The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy streets and homes. The air was thick with the smell of smoke and ash, a constant reminder of the inferno that had ravaged the old mill on the outskirts of town just a week ago.

In the fire station on Elm Street, Firefighter Jackson "Jax" Everett stood at attention beside his trusty engine, watching as the day's last training exercise came to an end. Jax, a tall and lean 32-year-old with piercing blue eyes and a strong jawline, had been a firefighter for over five years, and he took pride in being one of the best.

As he gazed out at the quiet streets, Jax's mind wandered back to the call that had brought him to Ravenswood just last week. A young woman named Sarah Jenkins, who had lost her home in the blaze at the old mill, had been injured while trying to escape the inferno. The memory of Sarah's terrified face and her pleas for help still lingered in Jax's mind.

Just then, the fire chief, a gruff but fair man named Bill Thompson, called out to Jax over the loudspeaker. "Alright, team, let's gear up and head home. We've got a quiet night ahead of us."

As Jax made his way back into the station, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease settled in the pit of his stomach, like a storm was brewing on the horizon. Little did he know, tonight would be anything but quiet...
