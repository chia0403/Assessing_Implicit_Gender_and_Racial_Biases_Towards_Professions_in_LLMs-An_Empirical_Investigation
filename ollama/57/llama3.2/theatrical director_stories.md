As the sun set over the worn stone façade of La Belle Époque Theatre, Lucas Ryder Wallace stood at the edge of the dimly lit stage, his eyes scanning the empty seats like he was searching for a ghost from a bygone era. The once-grand theatre, a beloved staple of London's West End, now struggled to stay afloat in a world where streaming services and trendy new venues seemed to be eclipsing the art of live performance.

Lucas, a theatrical director with a passion that bordered on obsession, had always been drawn to La Belle Époque's worn beauty. He saw something in its crumbling grandeur that others might see as decay – a reminder that true magic was not about flashy special effects or cutting-edge technology, but about the human experience.

As he took a deep breath, the scent of old velvet and stale air filling his lungs, Lucas felt a familiar sense of restlessness. He had been planning this production for months, pouring over plays, scripts, and scores in search of something that spoke to him on a fundamental level. And then, just yesterday, it hit him – a forgotten masterpiece from the early 20th century, written by a playwright who was as much a product of his time as he was a critic of its excesses.

The words danced in Lucas's mind like sparks: "The Theatre of the Absurd" – a title that seemed to speak directly to his own sense of disillusionment with the world around him. He knew, without a doubt, that this was going to be his masterpiece. The question now was, would anyone else see it?
