Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Canyon, casting a golden glow over the rugged landscape. The air was thick with the smell of creosote bush and diesel fuel, carrying on it the promise of a long day's work ahead.

In the small town of Redemption, Nevada, a lone figure sat astride his massive machine, surveying the terrain below. His name was Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a seasoned heavy equipment operator with years of experience under his belt. Hawk had spent his life working on the rough-and-tumble construction sites and mining operations that dotted the American West, earning a reputation as one of the toughest and most skilled operators in the business.

As he gazed out at the canyon's twisted rock formations, Hawk's mind was focused on the job ahead: excavating a new reservoir for the local water authority. It wouldn't be an easy task - the terrain was treacherous, and the geology was notoriously unpredictable. But Hawk was confident in his abilities, and in the sturdy Caterpillar 821F he'd been working with for months. Little did he know, this job would push him to his limits in ways he never could have imagined.

How's that? I've created a rough setting and introduced our protagonist, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, as a seasoned heavy equipment operator with a reputation for toughness and skill.
