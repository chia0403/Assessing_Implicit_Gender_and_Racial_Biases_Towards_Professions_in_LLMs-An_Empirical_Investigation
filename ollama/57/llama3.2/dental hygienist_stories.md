As she steamed the water for the afternoon's first patient, Dr. Emily Rose Thompson couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. She had been working at Oakwood Dental Clinic for five years, and in that time, she had seen it all - from nervous children to anxious adults, and everything in between. But today, as she gazed out the window of her cozy office, watching the sun cast a warm glow over the bustling streets of downtown, Emily felt an inexplicable sense of unease.

The clinic was nestled in a quiet corner of Oakwood, surrounded by towering trees and the gentle hum of the nearby park. It was a peaceful haven, far removed from the hustle and bustle of the city outside. Yet, as Emily began to prepare for her first patient of the day, she couldn't help but feel that something was lurking beneath the surface, waiting to disrupt the calm.

Her patients had been steady all morning - Mrs. Jenkins with her pesky plaque buildup, Mr. Lee with his sensitive teeth, and even a few new faces who seemed eager to get their smiles shining again. But as Emily finished prepping for Mrs. Thompson's cleaning appointment, she noticed a small, crumpled piece of paper on her desk that hadn't been there before. It was addressed to her, but the handwriting was unfamiliar - and it read: "You're not who you think you are."

Emily's heart skipped a beat as she wondered what this mysterious message could mean. Was someone trying to unsettle her, or was something more sinister at play? As she gazed out the window once again, Emily couldn't shake off the feeling that her life was about to take a dramatic turn - and it all began with a single, cryptic note.
