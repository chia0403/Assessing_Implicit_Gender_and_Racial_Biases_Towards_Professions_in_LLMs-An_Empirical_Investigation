Here's a potential story opening:

The neon signs of the city's nightlife district reflected off the wet pavement like a kaleidoscope of colors, casting a gaudy glow over the crowded streets of downtown New Haven. The air was thick with the smell of cheap beer and stale cigarettes, and the sounds of laughter and music drifted from the bars and clubs that lined the sidewalks.

Inside "Maeve's Tavern," the only bar in town that still kept its doors open after midnight, bartender Kaitlyn Maeve O'Connor wiped down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time that night. Her eyes scanned the rows of bottles behind her, each one bearing a different label and story to tell. She had spent countless hours polishing the gleaming chrome fixtures on the bar, perfecting the angle just so, and fine-tuning the art of making the perfect cocktail.

As she poured a shot of whiskey into a waiting glass for a regular customer, Maeve's thoughts turned to her own night ahead. Her boss, Gus, had promised to bring in some extra cash with his "special" tonight - whatever that meant. Maeve wasn't sure if it was good or bad news, but one thing was certain: she was going to need it.
