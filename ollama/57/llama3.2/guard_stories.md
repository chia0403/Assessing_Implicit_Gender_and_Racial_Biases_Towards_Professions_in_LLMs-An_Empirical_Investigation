Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set on the crumbling walls of New Haven Prison, casting a dark shadow over the rugged landscape of the Scottish Highlands. The wind howled through the empty corridors like a chorus of restless spirits, its mournful cries echoing off the stone floors.

Inside the prison, Guard Commander Angus MacPherson stood watch at the entrance to the maximum-security wing, his eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of movement. At 45 years old, he had spent over two decades on the force, and the weight of his responsibilities was starting to show in the deep lines etched into his weathered face.

As a veteran of some of Scotland's most notorious prisons, Angus had seen it all - from the despairing sobs of young offenders to the cold-blooded calculations of hardened felons. He took pride in his work, though, knowing that he was one of the few constants in a world that seemed determined to break him.

The wind died down for a moment, and Angus's trained ear picked up the faint sound of footsteps echoing from the depths of the prison. He tensed, hand on the grip of his nightstick, ready for whatever lay ahead. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a night that would test everything he thought he knew about justice, loyalty, and the true meaning of honor.
