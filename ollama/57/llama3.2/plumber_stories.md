Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood City gleamed like polished leather, reflecting the dim glow of streetlights that cast long shadows across the pavement. Inside his cramped, dimly lit plumbing shop, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins wiped the sweat from his forehead, his calloused hands still stained with the remnants of last night's job.

As a plumber, Hawk had seen it all – clogged drains, burst pipes, and the occasional mysterious stain that seemed to defy explanation. But tonight was different. Tonight, he had received a cryptic phone call from an old acquaintance, Victor LaGrange, who worked at the local hospital. Victor's voice had been low and urgent, his words tumbling out in a rush: "Hawk, I need your help. There's something going on in one of the hospital's pipes, something big. Meet me at the old warehouse on 5th and Main at midnight. Come alone."

Hawk raised an eyebrow as he scribbled down the address on a grease-stained notepad. What could Victor possibly have gotten himself into this time? He rubbed his tired eyes, wondering if it was worth the risk of leaving his shop unattended for the night. But something about Victor's tone had piqued his interest – and Hawk knew he couldn't resist the allure of a mystery.

As the clock struck 11 PM, Hawk locked up his shop and set out into the rain-soaked night, his heart pounding with anticipation. Little did he know, the real adventure was only just beginning.
