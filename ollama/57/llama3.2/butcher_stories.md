Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The misty dawn broke over the sleepy town of Ashwood, casting a gloomy veil over the cobblestone streets and half-timbered buildings that seemed to lean in, as if sharing secrets. In the heart of this quaint village, where the river Trent flowed sluggishly through the valley, stood the family butcher shop, "Harrison & Sons." It was here that Emilia Harrison, a stout woman with a kind face and hands stained with crimson from years of butchering, prepared for another day's work.

As she wiped the sweat from her brow, Emilia surveyed the rows of neatly arranged meat carcasses, each one expertly labeled with its cut and origin. The smell of fresh game and woodsmoke wafted through the air, mingling with the murmur of early morning conversation between the villagers outside. It was a typical Ashwood day â€“ quiet, methodical, and filled with the promise of warmth and community.

But amidst this tranquility, Emilia's thoughts were elsewhere. Her mind kept drifting back to the strange letter she had received that morning, its message cryptic and unsettling. It spoke of an ancient ritual, one that required her unique skills as a butcher, and a mysterious figure who would arrive at midnight, demanding her presence. As the first light of dawn crept over the horizon, Emilia's fingers tightened around the wooden handle of her cleaver, her senses heightened in anticipation of what lay ahead.

With a deep breath, she steeled herself for whatever the day might bring, and stepped into the cool darkness of the shop, ready to face whatever secrets Ashwood had in store for her.
