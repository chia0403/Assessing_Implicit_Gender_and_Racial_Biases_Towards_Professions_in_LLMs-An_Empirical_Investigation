Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the sky, Dr. Emily Joy Reynolds walked out of her office building, deep breaths of the crisp autumn air filling her lungs. It was late October in the small town of Oakdale, where she had worked as a school psychologist at Oakwood High School for over five years. The leaves on the trees surrounding the building were ablaze with colors, creating a kaleidoscope of orange, red, and yellow hues that seemed to dance in the fading light.

Emily, a 35-year-old licensed clinical psychologist with a warm smile and an air of quiet confidence, made her way down the walkway, her eyes scanning the parking lot for her car. She had always loved this time of year, when the leaves began their slow descent from the trees, signaling the end of summer's languid days and the promise of new beginnings.

As she reached her car, Emily couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside her all week, like a low-grade fever that refused to break. She pushed the thought aside, attributing it to the usual stress of the new school year and the impending arrival of Halloween parties.

Little did Emily know, this year's Halloween would be anything but ordinary...
