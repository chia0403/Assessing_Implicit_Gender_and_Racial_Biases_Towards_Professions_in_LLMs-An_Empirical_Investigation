Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she stepped into her flagship boutique, a warm golden light spilled across the polished marble floor, illuminating the rows of sleek, designer sofas and chairs that seemed to whisper promises of comfort and style. The scent of fresh flowers wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of quiet conversation and the soft strains of jazz music drifting from the speakers.

Aubrey Rose Wellington, a renowned interior decorator with a keen eye for detail and a passion for creating spaces that felt like a character's home away from home, surveyed her domain with pride. The boutique, aptly named "Rose & Co.", was more than just a store - it was a sanctuary, a haven where clients could come to find the perfect pieces to complete their dream spaces.

The walls were adorned with stunning works of art, each one carefully curated to reflect Aubrey's eclectic and refined taste. From the vintage chandeliers that hung like diamonds from the ceiling to the plush area rugs that seemed to whisper secrets on the floor, every detail had been meticulously chosen to transport those who entered into a world of elegance and refinement.

As she made her way through the store, Aubrey's eyes landed on a few select pieces - a vintage armchair in a rich, velvety fabric, a stunning crystal chandelier that refracted light into a thousand tiny rainbows, and a pair of sleek, modern side tables that seemed to defy gravity with their minimalist elegance.

But despite the beauty that surrounded her, Aubrey couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of restlessness had been growing inside of her for weeks, ever since she'd received an unexpected phone call from an old flame - a call that would change everything.
