## The Rusty Wrench

Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Arthur "Rusty" Thompson's workshop, turning the usually sunny expanse into a bleak, waterlogged haven.  The workshop smelled of old pipes and gasoline, a potent aroma that always managed to stir memories of childhood. Rusty sat hunched over his workbench, a flickering gas lamp casting long shadows across the tools scattered like fallen soldiers - each one holding stories of countless leaky faucets and overflowing septic tanks. 

He was a man forged by the demands of the city's plumbing underworld, his weathered hands bearing the scars of countless repairs. But today, something different hung in the air. The storm wasn’t just hammering rain; it felt… charged.  Rusty straightened, feeling his gut twist with unease as he glanced at the battered antique clock perched on the wall – its brass face cracked and faded. It was almost time.
