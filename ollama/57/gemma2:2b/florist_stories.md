The aroma of lilies, jasmine, and freshly cut grass hung heavy in the air as Elara "Ellie" Thornfield tended to her overflowing flower stall at the edge of Willow Creek market.  Rain pattered softly on the canvas awning above, and Ellie looked up from the arrangement of vibrant sunflowers she was crafting. The sky, a bruised canvas of lavender and gray, held promises of more showers. A flicker of melancholy stirred in her heart as she noticed the empty chair next to the weathered wooden table where she normally chatted with regulars before they went on their week-day errands.

Ellie’s floral business thrived on the quiet charm of Willow Creek, a quaint town nestled between rolling hills and whispering willow trees. It wasn't just her flowers that captivated customers, it was Ellie herself - a woman with bright eyes, a mischievous grin, and a voice like sun-warmed honey. She knew everyone in the town, from old Mrs. Henderson who always bought a bouquet of forget-me-nots for her late husband to young Timmy Johnson, whose first love was blooming into an uncharted wilderness as he wandered through the woods near Ellie’s shop. 

The bustling market felt different this week, devoid of the usual symphony of chatter and laughter. It seemed like even the wind held its breath under the somber sky, a stark contrast to the lively energy that usually filled the air in the twilight hours. As Ellie reached for a wilting marigold, she knew something was amiss.
