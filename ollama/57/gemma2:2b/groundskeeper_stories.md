The morning mist clung to Hawthorne Manor like a reluctant lover, obscuring everything in shades of gray.  Even the vibrant red roses that usually bloomed with such brazen confidence seemed subdued under the oppressive blanket of fog. 

This was the domain of Amelia Thornewood, or Millie as she preferred. The groundskeeper at Hawthorne Manor had kept the sprawling estate meticulously maintained for over three decades.

Each twist of a gnarled rosebush, each uneven line in the manicured lawn, carried a silent narrative of lives lived and lost.  And as Millie worked her routine, she felt the weight of centuries pressing down on her, each season etching another layer onto the fabric of time.
