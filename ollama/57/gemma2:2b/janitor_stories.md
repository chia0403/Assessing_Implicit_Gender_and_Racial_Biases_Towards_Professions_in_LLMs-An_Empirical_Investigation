The fluorescent lights buzzed like angry bees in Stanley "Stan" Worthington's ears.  His worn, blue uniform felt more like a shroud than protection as he traversed the labyrinthine corridors of the prestigious Blackwood University. Every surface, every inch of these hallowed halls echoed with the hushed whispers of intellectual pursuit and academic ambition. But for Stan, this symphony was punctuated by the relentless whirring of the vacuum cleaner, its mechanical song a stark contrast to the soaring pronouncements he’d overheard from professors. He shuffled down another hall, his mop trailing like a dejected shadow behind him, each step echoing in the cavernous silence. 

Stan wasn't proud of his job; not one bit.  He was the last person anyone expected to clean up after these students who spent their days lost in the pursuit of knowledge. But somehow, he felt strangely attached to this place. Perhaps it was the comforting rhythm of sweeping and mopping, or perhaps it was the memories that clung to him like dust motes - memories of his own youth, of youthful dreams and shattered hopes, all washed away by the harsh reality of adulthood.  He glanced at the worn yearbook he'd found tucked into a dusty corner near the boiler room – the only glimpse of himself from the past twenty years. A photo of a young man with hopeful eyes – Stan. Now, a faded reflection of his former self. 


He sighed and continued down the hallway, the weight of an unspoken story settling on his shoulders.  Tonight was the annual Blackwood Gala.  A night of glitz, glamour, and secrets whispered in hushed tones - a night when the veil between reality and illusion peeled away for just one night.  And Stan, like every janitor before him, would be there, silently bearing witness to it all, a silent observer in the grand spectacle of life.
