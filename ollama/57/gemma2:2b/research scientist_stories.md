Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's laboratory, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the glass.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows on his cluttered workspace, highlighting stacks of dusty books and overflowing shelves lined with test tubes and petri dishes. Outside, the storm raged, mimicking the turmoil churning inside Elias. He had dedicated his life to unlocking the secrets of consciousness, only to find himself facing a wall - not of ignorance, but of insurmountable reality.  His latest experiment was designed to connect to a human brain's neural network in real-time, and he believed it could unlock the potential for thought regeneration, even in those with severe cognitive decline. Yet, all that had been achieved were frustratingly intermittent spikes of connection, followed by a deafening silence from his subject, Dr. Eleanor Bellinger - an elderly woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease.  Elias stared at the monitor displaying Eleanor's fragmented brainwaves, a wave crashing against a beach of sandbars.  His heart pounded in his chest like a caged bird. Was he on the brink of a breakthrough, or had he just fallen further down a rabbit hole of endless possibilities and impossible dreams?
