The air hung heavy with the scent of granite dust and sweat, each detail blending in the grey haze of dawn's arrival.  Rain drummed a persistent rhythm against the weathered roof of the workshop as Arcturus "Art" Blackwood, his calloused hands gripped tightly around a chisel, stared at the block of marble before him.  His quarry was an ancient temple, swallowed whole by the unforgiving sea centuries ago.  The task lay before him: carve out the visage of Poseidon, god of the seas, from this unyielding stone. 

He wasn't just carving; he was painting a story with each stroke. Every line flowed from his soul, echoing the fury of the ocean and the melancholic wisdom of the old sea-worn myths. The workshop, a relic of forgotten times, held a lifetime’s worth of memories –  his grandfather's worn tool belt, a testament to years spent honing these skills; his father's weathered sketches tucked away in an ancient cedar chest; the stories whispered by the wind that rustled through the crumbling remains of the nearby ruins. 

Art was more than just a stone cutter; he was a storyteller, and his chisel was the pen with which he etched tales onto the very stones themselves. The ocean's whispers filled his ears as he began, and he knew this piece would be different, imbued with a quiet sorrow that would forever mark his craft.
