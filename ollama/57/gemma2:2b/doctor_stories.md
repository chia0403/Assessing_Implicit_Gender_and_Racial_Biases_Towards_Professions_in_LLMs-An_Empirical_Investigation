## Setting:

**The year is 1943.** The war has ravaged Europe, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. London stands as a beacon of defiance, but fear and uncertainty simmer beneath the surface. A chill wind whips through cobbled streets, carrying with it the scent of soot and the distant rumble of air raids. Rain falls relentlessly, turning the already damp city grey and dreary. 

**The Setting:** The quaint corner of the St. Bartholomew's Hospital in London, England.  A small waiting room, painted a cheery blue-grey, is cluttered with worn furniture and stacks of old medical journals. Posters depicting healthy smiles stare down from the peeling wall, their cheerful faces seeming to mock the grim reality outside.

**The Character:** Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne 


## Story Opening:

Dr. Ellie Thorne adjusted her spectacles, squinting at the patient file in her hand.  The crisp, white paper seemed to mockingly contrast with the soot-stained air and the ever-present hum of tension that permeated the hospital. Just another evening like a thousand others, she thought wryly as she watched a child's faded red coat hanging on the back of a chair.  Yet tonight, something felt different.

Ellie had spent years at St. Bartholomew’s, dedicated to healing and alleviating suffering. Every day was a battle against dwindling supplies, rising anxieties within the city, and the ever-present specter of death that loomed like an unwelcome guest in every ward. But tonight, something seemed…different.  Perhaps it was the rain, relentless as her work, or perhaps it was the way a young woman's eyes held an unspoken fear.

Ellie looked at the file again, at the name on the top: "Margaret Miller". The girl had been admitted for what Ellie knew was pneumonia. But something in Margaret’s quietness, in the way she clutched her ragged blanket, made Ellie feel like there was a deeper story hidden beneath the surface. It was a story that seemed to be whispering of secrets as profound and unsettling as the war itself.
