##  The Whispering Walls 

**Setting:** A secluded, ivy-choked cottage nestled within the rolling hills of Cornwall, England. Rain lashed against the leaded windows, turning the once-tranquil interior into a swirling mass of grey and green. The stone hearth crackled with a dying fire, its flames struggling to banish the encroaching chill.

**Character:**  Evelyn Thorne - or Evie as she preferred - was her usual self: sharp, methodical, with a stubborn streak visible even in the gentle slope of her worn-out tweed jacket. She had spent years mastering the art of rehabbing the bodies of injury and disease, but tonight, the quiet rustle of leaves against the windows seemed to whisper a different kind of story. 

Tonight, she wasn't just treating a broken ankle or a shattered knee. Tonight, Evelyn was facing her own demons - ones that manifested not in bones and ligaments, but in the dusty, neglected corners of this very house, whispering tales of forgotten lives and lost loves.   The legacy of her family was tied to these walls: a history whispered through generations, a past she hadn't dared to confront until now. 


**Opening:**  Evelyn had always been drawn to the physical, the concrete. The way limbs moved in sync with their muscles, and the symphony of crackling bones after a long day of work. But here, amidst the whispers of the wind and the relentless rhythm of rain, she felt her usual composure falter. It was as if her carefully constructed world of logic and routine had begun to crumble under the weight of these silent stories, of unseen lives that seemed to linger in the very air around her.
