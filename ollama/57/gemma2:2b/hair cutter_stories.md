The air in "Shear Delight" hung thick with hairspray, the faint scent of lavender shampoo clinging to the worn linoleum floor. Rain lashed against the shop's single window, blurring the neon-lit sign that read "A Cut Above."  Inside, Elara, a woman whose name was as quiet and graceful as her work, hummed softly as she meticulously snipped at a young man's unruly curls. Her name, whispered amongst regulars for years, was synonymous with precision.

Elara, known as "The Duchess" to the regulars, had built her salon from the ground up in this quiet seaside town. It wasn't glamorous, but it was hers - her sanctuary of soft lighting, wooden chairs carved by a local artisan, and endless cups of Earl Grey tea.  But tonight, something felt different. The usual symphony of chatter was replaced with an unsettling silence. Even the rhythmic clip-clop of Elaraâ€™s shears seemed to falter in the eerie stillness.
