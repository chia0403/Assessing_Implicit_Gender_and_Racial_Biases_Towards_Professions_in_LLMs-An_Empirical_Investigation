The scent of lavender and chamomile drifted through Dr. Eleanor Vance's office like an unspoken apology. The windows were draped in heavy drapes, blocking out the bright July sun even as it cast long shadows across the plush armchair she had left empty.  Eleanor, her usual patient focus replaced by a tired slumping, ran a hand through her already windswept brown hair. Each day started the same – filled with the echoing silence of yesterday’s patients, each case a tiny world collapsing under her watchful eyes.

Her practice in the quaint town of Ashwood wasn't exactly bustling, and Eleanor knew it.  People seemed to flock to larger cities where life felt more dynamic, leaving behind the quiet charm of Ashwood and its predictable routines. A place where the trees whispered secrets on a slow summer breeze and the air was heavy with unspoken hopes and anxieties. But within those whispers, Eleanor had found her purpose: guiding others through the tangled woods of their lives.

The phone chimed, breaking the silence. It was Ms. Peterson, a regular at the center for older adults. The call was brief - just the usual anxieties about her daughter's upcoming marriage, followed by a quiet, choked cough from the other end. Eleanor’s hands tightened into fists, a familiar tightness in her stomach that never quite went away. 


The woman on the phone was only one of countless narratives weaving themselves through her practice, each story a fragile tapestry begging for careful stitching and understanding.  Tonight, however, Eleanor would have to unravel them all.
