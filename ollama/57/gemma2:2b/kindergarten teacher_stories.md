The morning air hung thick and sweet with the scent of freshly cut lawnmower blades and blooming lilacs.  Sunlight streamed through the windows of Maplewood Kindergarten's bright yellow building, illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden rays. Inside, Ms. Evelyn Rosewell was already lost in a world of crayons and glitter, her patience wearing thin as she watched three-year-olds squabble over a shared box of Play Doh. 

Evelyn sighed as little Finn, with his bright blue eyes and unruly brown curls, shoved his building blocks into the sandbox like a tiny bulldozer. “Finn,” she gently chided, “Sharing is caring.”  He looked at her, brows furrowed in concentration, then plopped a block on top of a pile. 

Evelyn's heart, usually brimming with warm anticipation for another day of learning and laughter, felt as heavy as the leaden clouds gathering over the sky. She knew today was going to be different. Something was off, an intangible hum of unease that ran beneath the joyful chaos of her classroom.
  
Setting: Maplewood Kindergarten, a cozy yellow building nestled amidst the charming Victorian homes of Willow Creek, a small town in Maine. The school is surrounded by lush green lawns and old oak trees, and its windows look out onto the bustling street with children playing.
