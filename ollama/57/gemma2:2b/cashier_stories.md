Rain hammered against the diner windows, blurring the neon glow of "The Rusty Mug" into a kaleidoscope of reds and greens.  Inside, dust motes danced in the warm yellow light emanating from the old jukebox, their quiet waltz interrupted by Amelia's steady rhythm as she rang up the last customer for his double bacon cheeseburger. 

Amelia “Amy” Carter had worked at The Rusty Mug for three years now, three years of witnessing the ebb and flow of small-town life,  from the sleepy mornings to the chaotic Friday night after school dances. She was used to her routine: the familiar faces, the predictable banter with regulars like Mr. Henderson, whose coffee order always involved a generous dash of cinnamon. 

But tonight, something felt different. The rain seemed heavier than usual, and the wind whispered an unsettling tale as it whipped through the worn-out awning outside.  As she scanned a young couple's receipt for their milkshakes, Amy noticed a flicker in the corner of her eye – someone lurking near the back alleyway. They were tall and cloaked in shadow, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. A shiver ran down her spine as she caught a glimpse of their hand holding something... metallic and glinting under the dim light.
