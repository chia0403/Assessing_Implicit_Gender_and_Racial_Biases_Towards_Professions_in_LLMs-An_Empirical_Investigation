The air hung thick with antiseptic and stale anxiety in Dr. Amelia Thorne's office. The only sounds were the rhythmic ticking of a clock on the wall and the gentle sigh of wind whistling through the grimy windowpane, mirroring the unease gnawing at Amelia's gut. She was staring at the case file spread open on her desk, its contents as grim as the image etched into her mind - a child’s twisted handprint in cement, a mangled metal toy lying beside it. It felt like every fiber of her being was screaming to turn away, to forget about the unspeakable tragedy that had unfolded in this quiet suburban cul-de-sac just hours ago.  She was Amelia Thorne, forensic psychologist specializing in trauma and violence, and she was tasked with piecing together a puzzle that would never be whole, a nightmare she wouldn’t wish on anyone.
