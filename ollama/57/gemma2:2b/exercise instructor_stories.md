Rain lashed against the gymnasium windows, blurring the neon sign proclaiming "Fit & Flourish" into an abstract smear of colour.  A familiar feeling of frustration welled up in Aurora Thorne's chest as she glanced at the steady stream of students shuffling inside, their faces illuminated by the harsh glare of the fluorescent lights. It was Wednesday night, her busiest session, and yet... something felt off. 

Aurora, with her vibrant turquoise tank top and matching leggings that showcased every muscle group honed from years of dedication to fitness training, sighed. It wasn't just the weather; there was a strange air of discontent hanging in the room like damp towels left out overnight. The usual jovial energy was replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by the rhythmic thud of sneakers on hardwood floors and muffled sighs. 

Her gaze fell upon Liam, a lanky young man at the back who usually pumped his fists to the beat of the music, his face masked with frustration as he tried, and failed, to complete a series of squats. The air hung heavy with unspoken anxieties - a pressure that felt more suffocating than the raindrops outside. Aurora knew this feeling all too well. She just hadn't expected it to be so prevalent within her own walls.
