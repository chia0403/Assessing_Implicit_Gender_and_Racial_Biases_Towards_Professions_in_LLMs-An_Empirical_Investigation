## The Old Workshop's Secrets 

The scent of sawdust and varnish clung to the air like a ghost, swirling around Elias Thorne's worn leather apron. Sunlight slanted through the dusty attic window, casting long, crooked shadows across the floor of his grandfather's old workshop.  Built in 1857, the space hummed with untold stories - whispers from generations past echoing in every crack and creak. Elias ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of an ancient workbench, its grain deeply etched by time and use. This was where his father had crafted beautiful pieces, but where Elias had found solace in solitude, crafting his own dreams within the walls' embrace.

He knelt down, fingers tracing familiar grooves in a half-finished oak carving. It was a woman, her features defined with delicate skill, yet an unsettling calm settled over him as he looked at it. The workshop wasn't just a place for work; it was a living being, whispering secrets into the air as his own thoughts did. And tonight, the attic seemed to hum with more than just dust and timber.
