The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Ms. Evelyn Ainsworth's office, mimicking the insistent rhythm of her own thoughts.  She sat behind a worn oak desk, its surface littered with files thicker than they should be. The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and old hope, a familiar aroma in this corner of town where life seemed to cling precariously to survival's razor-thin edge. 

Evelyn Ainsworth, her name a solemn echo of its origins - from an ancestor who had navigated the treacherous waters of London's underworld – was on probation duty. This morning’s appointment was with Michael “Mikey” Jones, a twenty-year-old whose history was as scarred and worn as the wood of her desk.  He was standing in the grimy doorway, hunched over like a cornered animal. The rain lashed at his face, and she could see the worry lines etching deep within his eyes. 

**Setting:** A small, run-down probation office in a dilapidated neighborhood of West End City, England.


**Character Name:** Evelyn Ainsworth
