## Setting the Stage: 

**Location:** Sunnyside Elementary School - nestled in a quaint suburban neighborhood surrounded by lush green lawns and towering oak trees. Its iconic red brick façade blends seamlessly with the rest of the neighborhood, but inside, chaos often reigns supreme, fueled by the vibrant personalities of its students and the constant hum of educational anxieties.

**Time:**  A crisp autumn afternoon, just as the first golden rays of sunset start to bleed through the school windows. The last straggling bus is pulling away, leaving behind a chorus of chattering students who are already getting swept into their after-school activities – soccer practice, piano lessons, dance rehearsals, and even the annual bake sale. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia Lawson, her calm blue eyes peering through thick-framed glasses.  She’s been working at Sunnyside for six years now, a familiar presence with a gentle demeanor and a heart overflowing with empathy.  Her office, tucked away on the second floor, is painted in soft lavender, adorned with framed botanical prints and the comforting aroma of lavender oil diffuser. 


## Story Opening:

The click-clack of Dr. Lawson's leather heels echoed through the empty hallway as she stepped into her office. It was time for her afternoon meeting with Liam McArthur, a fourth grader whose world had been shaken by the recent tragedy of his dog's passing.  Liam sat hunched on the corner chair, his usual spark replaced with an unyielding melancholy. 

"So," Dr. Lawson started, her voice soft and measured, "you want to talk about Bailey?"  She placed a comforting hand on Liam’s shoulder, her gaze meeting his tear-filled eyes. "It's okay to be sad." She paused, drawing him out from the depths of his silence. "Tell me, Liam. What do you miss most about Bailey?"
