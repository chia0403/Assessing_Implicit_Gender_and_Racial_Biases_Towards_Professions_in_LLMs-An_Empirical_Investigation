The air hung heavy with the scent of turpentine and dust motes danced in the golden beams that slanted through the skylight.  Eleanor "Elle" Hawthorne's easel stood before her like a silent sentinel, its white canvas awaiting her touch. The studio was a cathedral of color, a world away from the bustling chaos of the city outside. 

Elle was lost, not in thought as much as she was in feeling. A storm raged within her, mirroring the tempestuous ocean that crashed against the rocks just beyond the studio's bay window.  Her latest canvas, an attempt at capturing the raw fury of a hurricane, had remained stubbornly blank for days. All she could muster were muted hues and lifeless strokes; it wasn't the sea that troubled her, but its reflection in the mirror-like surface of her own soul. 

It was here, amidst these colors and this silence, that Elle sought solace, her brush a lifeline to an unyielding reality she couldnâ€™t quite grasp.  The storm outside seemed to echo the turmoil brewing within her; Elle needed to find her way back from this precipice before she drowned in it. The question wasn't if, but how.
