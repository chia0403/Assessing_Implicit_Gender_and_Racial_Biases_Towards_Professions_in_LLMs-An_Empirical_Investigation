Rain lashed against the cracked windowpanes of Mrs. Hemlock's quaint cottage, mimicking the rhythm of the storm brewing inside Amelia "Amy" Sterling's soul. The air hung thick with the scent of damp wood and mildew, an olfactory reminder of her dwindling hope. Amy, a well-respected insurance agent in her quiet corner of rural Maine, felt like she was drowning in a sea of claims –  claims that were more than just monetary losses; they were testaments to lives shattered by unforeseen misfortune. 

Her latest call had been particularly unsettling. A young couple, barely older than college graduates, had lost their entire home in a wildfire that ripped through the pine-covered hills surrounding their little town last month. "How do you even begin to rebuild after something like this?" Amy asked Mrs. Hemlock, her voice catching on a lump of grief she couldn't seem to swallow. The woman simply nodded, her face etched with an unspoken pain that echoed across the miles Amy’s phone line had carried it to.  

As Amy hung up, she stared out the window at the swirling rain, wondering if there was anything left to salvage after the fire had consumed everything. Was this what her career was about, just navigating the wreckage of other people's lives?  She knew that helping people was a cornerstone of her profession but lately, the weight of it all seemed unbearable.
