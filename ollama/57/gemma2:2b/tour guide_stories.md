The morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets of Prague like a stubborn child refusing to leave its blanket.  Even at 7:30 AM on a Tuesday, the air hummed with an almost tangible excitement, fueled by a heady mix of history and possibility that only this city could muster. It was here, in the heart of this gothic wonderland, that Amelia "Amy" Vesper reigned supreme - not as a mere tourist attraction, but as a living legend amongst Prague's eager visitors. 

With her trademark auburn hair cascading down her shoulders like spun flame and eyes alight with the stories she was about to unleash upon the unsuspecting masses, Amy would usher each group through Old Town Square, transforming the familiar into something extraordinary.  As a guide for over 15 years, Amy's knowledge of Prague ran as deep as the Charles River, yet she still found joy in introducing new faces to the city's soul â€“ its secrets, its charm, and its magic.
