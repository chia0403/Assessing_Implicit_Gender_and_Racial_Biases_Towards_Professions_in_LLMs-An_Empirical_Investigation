The sun beat down on Elara Vance's neck like a blacksmith’s hammer.  Sweat stung her eyes as she squinted at the asphalt ahead, where it seemed to shimmer under the relentless glare. Dust devils danced across the desert expanse of Interstate 80, whipping up an eerie haze that obscured the setting sun. Her old pickup truck hummed along behind the heavy grader, the engine a familiar lullaby in this vast emptiness. Elara shifted in her seat, fingers tracing the chipped paint on the steering wheel.  For years, she'd been patching asphalt on this stretch of highway, a solitary act amidst the ever-growing sprawl that threatened to swallow everything whole.  

She was used to being alone, though today it felt different. The usual hum of the grader seemed drowned out by an unfamiliar anxiety thrumming in her chest. This job wasn't just about patching potholes; this was about stopping a leak before it widened into something bigger - something that could potentially threaten everything she’d built for herself here, and everything she thought she knew.
