The midday sun beat down on the cobbled streets of Aubergine City, turning the air thick and heavy with an almost tangible heat. Dust motes danced in the shaft of light that pierced through the worn awning of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's shop, where the air smelled of lavender soap and the faint tang of freshly-forged metal from his latest creation - a pair of intricately patterned breeches for a young Lord who was due to embark on his first hunting expedition.  The windowsill displayed a vibrant tapestry depicting a stag standing amidst wildflowers – a piece Bart himself created with meticulous care, a stark contrast to the bustling chaos outside. 

For years, Bart had been the city's most renowned tailor, known for his precision and artistry. He wove tales into each stitch of fabric, breathing life into simple garments that transformed ordinary men and women into extraordinary individuals. But lately, a disquieting feeling lingered in his heart – an ominous premonition that the city was teetering on the brink of something profound. A sense of unease that hung heavy like the morning mist over the river. He glanced at the clock - 12:03 pm, yet the silence of the workshop felt more unsettling than usual.  A faint tremor ran through the floorboards as if an invisible hand were pushing and pulling on the very fabric of reality.
