The crisp scent of old paper and stale coffee filled Esmeralda "Esme" Delacroix's office. Her worn, leather-bound ledger lay open on her desk, its pages whispering tales of countless transactions and forgotten fortunes.  A sunbeam, filtering through the dusty pane, cast a kaleidoscope of light onto her face as she diligently balanced entries in her familiar accounting journal. The year was 1927, and Esme's little storefront office tucked away in the heart of New Orleans stood as an anchor against the ever-changing currents of time. It was said to be one of the few remaining untouched by the city’s feverish energy, its silence a testament to the quiet life Esme led.  

Yet tonight, a distinct unease hung heavy in the air. The usual comforting hum of her work felt disrupted by an undercurrent of anxiety. A letter clutched in her hand seemed to pulsate with unspoken fears as she traced the faded ink with her fingertips. It had arrived from London, sent from an address that whispered secrets – "The Blackwood Estate."  

A shiver raced down Esme's spine. She knew better than anyone that some stories are never meant for a simple ledger entry; sometimes, they demanded a bolder stroke of destiny.
