The air hung thick with the scent of burning sugar and simmering spices as Elias "El" Moreau struggled to keep up with the morning rush at La Carotte Rouge, his tiny Parisian bistro bursting with life. El, a man whose age was as much defined by flour stains on his apron as it was in wrinkles etched around his eyes, had spent his life perfecting the delicate art of pastry - from the light-as-air puff pastry that brought tears to customers' eyes to the dense, buttery pain au chocolat that fueled their Parisian dreams. The bistro itself felt like a time capsule, its walls adorned with faded floral wallpaper and the same chipped china they'd used since before El could remember. But tonight was different. Tonight, La Carotte Rouge was about to host an exclusive gala for a renowned fashion designer who would be unveiling his new collection, and Elâ€™s usual quiet charm was replaced by a nervous flutter in his stomach as he watched the flurry of activity outside the door. The air crackled with anticipation; tonight wasn't just about the perfect macaron or the impeccable mille-feuille. Tonight, it was about making magic happen under the glittering Parisian night sky.
