Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Croft's cramped office at the law firm. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing inside her.  Amelia, with hair escaping its messy bun and a face etched with exhaustion, stared out at the chaotic cityscape. Her eyes were narrowed, focused on a crumpled legal brief that was supposed to be about as exciting as watching paint dry.

**Main character:** Amelia Croft - an ambitious but slightly burnt-out paralegal at "Fitzwilliam Law" known for handling mundane contract cases and her ever-increasing caffeine addiction.
