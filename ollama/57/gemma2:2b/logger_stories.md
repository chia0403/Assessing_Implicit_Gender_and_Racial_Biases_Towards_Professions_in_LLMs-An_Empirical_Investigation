## The Setting:

The air hung thick and heavy, saturated with the smell of pine needles and damp earth.  Sun filtered through the dense canopy of ancient redwoods in the Olympic National Forest, painting the forest floor in a patchwork of emerald light and shadow. A symphony of chirps and rustles filled the air as the morning mist clung to the towering trunks and the leaves whispered secrets in the breeze. The rhythmic crackle of timber falling echoed across the sprawling wilderness, punctuated by the distant drone of cicadas.

## Character: 

**Jasper Blackwood.**  A man weathered beyond his thirty years, Jasper was a logger with calloused hands and eyes that held the wisdom of countless sunrises and sunsets spent in this unforgiving but beautiful domain. Years of work had etched lines into his face, each one whispering stories of storms wrestled, felled trees he'd learned to respect, and the quiet camaraderie forged with the men who worked alongside him.  Despite the gruff exterior that hid a heart full of solitude, Jasper carried a deep-rooted loyalty to his family and the forest he called home.


## Story Opening:

Jasper adjusted his worn flannel shirt as he squinted at the horizon. The rising sun cast long shadows on the towering redwood giants, their massive trunks like slumbering titans. He was used to working alone -  the silence of the woods a comforting companion in his solitary life. Yet, today, there was an unsettling feeling in his gut, something beyond the usual pre-dawn unease that came with felling trees. The air held a strange stillness; even the chirping of the birds seemed muted.

His eyes narrowed as he looked towards the distant crest of Mount Olympus, the peak shrouded in a thick veil of mist. A sense of foreboding crept up his spine, an instinct he couldn't ignore.  He felt it wasn’t just the forest whispering warnings – it was something else too.  Something bigger, wilder, and… unnervingly silent. 

Jasper knew there was only one thing to do - put on his boots, grab his trusty axe, and head out into the wild. The forest held secrets, but sometimes the secrets whispered back, urging him to listen.
