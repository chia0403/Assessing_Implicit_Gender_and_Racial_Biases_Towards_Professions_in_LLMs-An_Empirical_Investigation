The rain hammered against the windshield like tiny fists, blurring the already fading streetlights into ghostly halos.  Officer Amelia “Amy” Hayes gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. Her beat was notorious for its grimy underbelly - a maze of dingy bars and late-night diners clustered around a crumbling waterfront with a history as dark as the sea itself. The air hung thick with exhaust fumes and desperation, punctuated by the distant wail of sirens. 

It was 3:17 am on a Wednesday, and Amy's shift had just begun. She glanced at the digital clock on the dashboard -  "Awaiting Dispatch" blinked in accusing neon red.  An hour away from her partner, Detective Miller’s usual pre-dawn coffee break at that greasy spoon diner with the chipped countertop and questionable hygiene. 

Amy couldn’t quite shake off a feeling, like an old song playing just out of reach, lingering in the air - something was different tonight.
