The wind whipped at Bartholomew "Barty" Stone's worn leather jacket, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and diesel exhaust.  He leaned back in his battered Ford F-350, the rumbling engine a familiar lullaby beneath the vast, grey expanse of the Montana sky. Barty wiped grime from his forehead, squinting at the towering redwoods that dominated the landscape.  Their emerald green trunks were like prehistoric giants, silhouetted against the bruised sunset he knew intimately well.

Barty's life was an orchestra of heavy metal, roaring chainsaws, and the occasional symphony of screeching brakes as a bulldozer plowed its way through the dense undergrowth. For him, these giant trees weren’t just landmarks - they were reminders. Reminders of the past, of family secrets buried deeper than the roots of any redwood.  He was a heavy equipment operator, but his true calling was to unearth what history had tried to bury. 

The project he was working on – excavating an old mining site rumored to hold some long-forgotten truth - had become more than just work. It was an excavation of Barty's own past. 


**Setting:**  A remote, forested stretch of Montana amidst the last remnants of a once-bustling logging community. The atmosphere is thick with secrets and shadowed by the imposing presence of ancient redwoods.
