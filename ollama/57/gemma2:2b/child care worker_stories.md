The late afternoon sun slanted through the window, casting long shadows across the playroom floor where 5-year-old Lucas was constructing a fortress out of blocks – his imagination running wild in its own little world.  Across the room, Lily Evans, with her bright smile and auburn hair tucked neatly behind one ear, watched him with a quiet fondness. She was a child care worker at "Sunshine Cottage," a small home for pre-schoolers nestled between a bakery and a cozy vintage bookstore. It was a place that buzzed with life, laughter echoing off the pastel walls, and the scent of freshly baked cookies mingling with old book pages. 

Lily found herself lost in thought, watching Lucas's tiny hands maneuver the blocks, then suddenly shifting to stacking them precariously high.  His world was filled with simple joys: building towers that could touch the ceiling, painting pictures of imaginary monsters, and pretending to fly a kite made from an old sheet. It made her heart swell with warmth. 

But today, something was different. A shadow seemed to linger in Lucas's eyes, an unspoken sadness clinging to him like the last wisps of afternoon light. Lily felt it too - a sense of unease that tugged at her resolve like the invisible thread of a child’s forgotten story.
