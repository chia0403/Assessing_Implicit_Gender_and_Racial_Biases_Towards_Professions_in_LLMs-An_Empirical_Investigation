## The Blood-Stained Canvas

Rain hammered against the windows of the clinic, blurring the streetlights into ghostly orbs. Inside, Amelia Thorne, with her sharp eyes squinting at the fluorescent hum of the lab equipment, carefully extracted a tiny vial filled with crimson liquid from a patient's arm.  This was not the first time she’d done it; years of practice had rendered it as commonplace as tying a shoelace. Yet, today, it felt different. The rain seemed louder, the fluorescent hum sharper, and the sterile smell of antiseptic clung to Amelia like an invisible shroud. 

Amelia's name was a whisper in her hometown - a legend amongst those who knew the whispered stories behind her seemingly detached personality. She was known as “The Artist” – not for paintings or sculptures, but for drawing blood. It was rumored that she had an unnervingly keen sense of what needed to be extracted, with each procedure becoming an unexpected masterpiece, each vein a delicate curve on the canvas of a patient's life. 

She worked at the Sunset Clinic, nestled in a quiet street lined by identical Victorian houses, its windows reflecting the dreary storm like cracked mirrors.  The clinic's exterior was bland, almost forgotten; a testament to Amelia’s preference for working her magic within. It was here that she saw not patients but subjects – each unique and complex, their stories etched in veins and arteries. She treated every procedure as a portrait, meticulously drawing the lifeblood onto the canvas of reality.  

Today, however, something felt off. The usual rhythmic tap-tap-tap of the blood draw machine seemed to echo through Amelia’s soul, amplifying the unease that gnawed at her insides.
