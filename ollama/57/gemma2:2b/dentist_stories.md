The morning mist hung heavy over Saltwind, clinging to Dr. Elias Thorne's coat like an unwelcome guest. It was the kind of day that made the salt-air sting in his lungs and brought memories of icy storms from childhood back to life. He pulled on his woolen scarf, its rough texture a familiar comfort against the chill. Elias had always found solace in routine, particularly in the sterile white space of his small office nestled on the edge of Saltwind's harbour.  

His chair was positioned by the window, its polished wood reflecting the muted greys and blues of the ocean outside. The faint scent of bleach, toothpaste, and a hint of lavender from the calming diffuser filled the room, a comforting reminder of order amidst the chaos of life.
