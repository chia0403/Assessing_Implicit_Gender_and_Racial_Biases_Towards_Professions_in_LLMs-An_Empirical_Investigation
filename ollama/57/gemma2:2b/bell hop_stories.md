The neon glow of the Stardust Hotel sign pulsed like a sickly heart against the velvet night sky.  Rain lashed down in sheets, each drop exploding against the glass facade of the grand lobby like tiny, angry comets. It was 1937, and the city of Chicago hummed with an electricity that felt both thrilling and unsettling.

Inside, amidst the swirling skirts of flapper girls and the low murmurs of men whispering over bourbon cocktails, stood Theodore "Teddy" Ashton, a bell hop with hands as weathered as his face, yet eyes that sparkled like the silver spoons he used to polish after hours.  His crisp white uniform was stained with countless spilled drinks and hidden beneath it lay a quiet desperation, fueled by dreams bigger than the city itself.

Teddy had seen more heartache than any man should, each night echoing the same familiar melody of lost love and unfulfilled promises. Tonight, however, held a new kind of burden, one that pressed heavier on his soul than a sackful of luggage ever could: the arrival of Mrs. Eleanor Winthrop, a woman whose beauty seemed to bleed into the very air she moved through. 

Her presence in this opulent hotel was a storm cloud, and Teddy felt it pull him closer, even as he knew its weight might crush him under its force.  He had seen that storm before, but this time, it felt different. This time, he wouldn't let her storms break his spirit.
