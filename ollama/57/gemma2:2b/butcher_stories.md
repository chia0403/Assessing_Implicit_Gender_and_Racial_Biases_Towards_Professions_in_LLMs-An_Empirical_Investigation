The morning mist clung to the cobbled streets like damp ghosts, blurring the already-muted glow of the rising sun. Inside "McAllister's Meats," the air hung thick with the sharp tang of cured hams and the earthy aroma of freshly ground peppercorns. Edgar McAllister sat amongst a mountain of butchered pork, his hands calloused from years of handling meat, yet still gentle when he lifted a tenderloin for inspection.  The rhythmic clang of his cleaver against the bone was almost hypnotic, each swing precise like a conductor leading an orchestra. Outside, London's quiet hum shifted to the cacophony of everyday life as the street vendor began hawking fresh bread from his cart. 

Edgar McAllister wasn’t just any butcher; he was considered a legend in this corner of Whitechapel. A master of his craft, with a keen eye for quality and an unyielding dedication to tradition, Edgar knew that true meat didn't simply exist—it flourished.  His shop was more than a business; it was a sanctuary, a testament to the silent dignity of life itself.
