The humid air hung heavy in the small town clinic, thick with the scent of antiseptic and hope.  Eleanor Pierce, her worn brown boots echoing against the linoleum floor of the waiting room, shifted uncomfortably on her stool. The morning's quiet was shattered by the excited shriek of a young boy, followed by the soft tap-tap-tap of his cane against the linoleum. 

Eleanor glanced down at the paperwork in her hand -  *Timothy McArthur, age 7*, and a scribbled note: *First time using the assistive device.* She smiled faintly; she had worked countless hours to teach Timothy how to navigate his world with ease, even after a recent accident left him struggling with mobility. He was as eager as ever for her visit, and in that, Eleanor found a solace she hadn't expected. 
**Setting:**  A small town clinic nestled amongst rolling hills in the countryside of Vermont. The quaint building with a weathered white facade houses a humble occupational therapy department.
