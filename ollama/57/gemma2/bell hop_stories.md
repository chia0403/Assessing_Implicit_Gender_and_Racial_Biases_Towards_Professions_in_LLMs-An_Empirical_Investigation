The air in the Grand Belvedere Hotel hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and stale cigarette smoke, a peculiar blend that was as much a part of its identity as the ornate mahogany doors and faded grandeur. Beneath the watchful gaze of a gilded cherub perched atop the reception desk, Theodore Bartholomew "Theo" Higgins polished brass buttons on a uniform that felt more like a costume than clothing.  His reflection in the mirror wasn't what he expected – a young man with eyes too old for his twenty-three years, etched with the weariness only constant service could bring. He adjusted the bellhop hat, its once pristine white now speckled with a dusting of dust and despair, then braced himself for another shift navigating the tangled lives and fleeting desires of the Grand Belvedere's guests. 


Theo sighed, the sound barely audible over the rhythmic clanging of a piano in the lobby lounge and the murmur of hushed conversations. The hotel was a microcosm of the city itself – a place where fortunes were made and lost, dreams were spun and shattered, all within the confines of its elegant walls.  For Theo, it was more than just a job; it was a stage upon which he observed humanity's greatest triumphs and most heartbreaking tragedies, playing his small part as the silent witness to their stories.
