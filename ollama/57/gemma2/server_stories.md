The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and desperation.  It clung to Amelia Beatrice Cartwright like a second skin, coating her in a film of grease and regret. The diner was nearing closing time, its once-bright red vinyl booths now faded and stained, mirroring the weariness in Amelia's own eyes. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into an unsteady beacon in the gloom.  Outside, the streetlamps cast elongated shadows that danced with the wind, like restless spirits seeking solace from the storm. Inside, Amelia polished a chipped mug for the tenth time that hour, her movements mechanical, her thoughts adrift. The clatter of dishes and the murmured conversations of tired truckers were the only sounds breaking the silence between bites.  Amelia wished she could disappear into the hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, escape the weight of the evening shift and the crushing loneliness that settled in like a second skin.
