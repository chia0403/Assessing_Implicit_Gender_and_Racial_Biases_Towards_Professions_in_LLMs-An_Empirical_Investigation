The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of Mr. Hemmings' office. Amelia Beatrice Cartwright, her perfectly-pressed skirt swaying as she walked, knew this smell well. It was the aroma of a crisis brewing, the kind that usually involved a misplaced document, a forgotten deadline, or worse - a rogue intern who had decided spreadsheets were best viewed at a 45-degree angle.  

Amelia's fingers itched to tidy the chaos on Mr. Hemmings' mahogany desk: the scattered legal pads, the half-eaten sandwich (mystery meat, likely), and the overflowing ashtray that looked more like a miniature volcano. But she knew better than to touch anything until her boss called for her. He wouldn’t be happy with an interruption, especially not today.

The day started like any other in the bustling heart of New York City, a symphony of honking taxis and distant sirens. Amelia's corner office overlooked a street teeming with life - businessmen rushing to meetings, artists sketching portraits on makeshift easels, and dogs leashed to lampposts, patiently waiting for their owners to finish their coffee. But Amelia felt strangely detached from the vibrant chaos below. Today, even the city seemed shrouded in an ominous stillness, like it was holding its breath. 


And Mr. Hemmings, usually a whirlwind of manic energy, sat behind his desk, uncharacteristically still. His brow was furrowed, and his gaze seemed lost somewhere beyond the city skyline, a silent storm brewing behind his steel-grey eyes. Amelia knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that this wasn't just another crisis. This was something different, something bigger, something…dangerous.
