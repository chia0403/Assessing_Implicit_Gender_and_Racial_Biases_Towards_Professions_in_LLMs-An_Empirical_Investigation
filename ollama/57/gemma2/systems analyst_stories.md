The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Amelia Rosethorn's face as she hunched over her monitor. Her fingers danced across the keyboard, navigating through lines of code like a seasoned conductor orchestrating a digital symphony. The air in the cramped server room smelled faintly of burnt electronics and stale coffee – a scent that had become strangely comforting to Amelia, the resident systems analyst at Helios Industries.

Helios was a sprawling tech giant specializing in AI development, renowned for its cutting-edge algorithms and groundbreaking projects. While most of the company buzzed with excitement about their latest neural network, Amelia's domain was the less glamorous but equally vital infrastructure that kept everything running. 

Tonight, however, wasn't just another night of troubleshooting minor glitches. A cryptic message flashed across her screen, a string of nonsensical characters followed by a timestamp: 03:14 AM. It was an anomaly, something out of the ordinary in Amelia's meticulously ordered world. Her pulse quickened. This wasn't a simple system error; this felt like something… different.


The server room, bathed in the cold glow of digital screens and humming with the low hum of cooling fans, suddenly felt oppressive. Amelia leaned back, her chair creaking ominously, and stared at the message again. A shiver ran down her spine. Whatever it was, she had a feeling this was just the beginning.
