Dust motes danced in the golden light, swirling around her like miniature ballerinas as she sat poised, pen hovering over a legal pad. A faint scent of lavender and sandalwood lingered in the air, a feeble attempt to mask the sterile tang that seemed to permeate every corner of the building. 

Evelyn sighed, the weight of another day settling heavily on her shoulders.  Her clinic, tucked away on a quiet side street in downtown Denver, wasn’t exactly bustling with clients. Most days felt like wading through a sea of melancholy, each patient bringing their own unique brand of pain to unravel. Today was no different. A young woman named Sarah sat opposite her, fidgeting nervously in the worn leather armchair.  Evelyn had a feeling this one would be particularly challenging - Sarah’s silence spoke volumes about the tangled web of anxieties she carried within. 


"Ready to begin, Sarah?" Evelyn asked, her voice a soothing balm amidst the unspoken tension. She leaned forward, her gaze warm and inviting. "There's no pressure, remember.  Just tell me whatever feels comfortable."
