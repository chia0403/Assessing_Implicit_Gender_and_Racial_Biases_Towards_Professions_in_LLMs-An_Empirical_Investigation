The air in "Shear Delight" hummed with the familiar symphony of clippers buzzing, hair dryers whirring, and the rustle of magazines being flipped through. Elara Seraphina adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the salon. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. 

Elara loved this time of day - just before the lunch rush. The quiet buzz was punctuated by bursts of laughter from clients catching up with each other or sharing gossip about the latest neighborhood drama. Elara thrived on these small moments of connection, weaving through conversations like she did through sections of hair, her gentle touch bringing solace and confidence to her customers. 

But today, a different kind of tension hung in the air. It wasn't the usual pre-rush jitters; it was something deeper, more unsettling. A sense of foreboding settled over Elara like a damp chill, even as she greeted Mrs. Henderson with her usual warmth and charm.  


Elara felt a prickle on the back of her neck, an inexplicable feeling that something wasn't right. The salon, usually her sanctuary, suddenly felt precarious, the walls closing in like a whisper of warning. She shook off the feeling, chalking it up to stress. But as Mrs. Henderson sat down, a flicker of panic crossed her face, and she whispered, "Elara, you have to be careful." 


 Elara's heart skipped a beat.
