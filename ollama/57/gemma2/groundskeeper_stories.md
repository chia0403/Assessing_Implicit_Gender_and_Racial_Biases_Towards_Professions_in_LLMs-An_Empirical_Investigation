The dew still clung to Amelia Thistlewick's boots as she surveyed her domain. The sprawling estate of Oakhaven Manor, with its manicured lawns, meticulously sculpted hedges, and ancient oak trees reaching towards the bruised sky, was her canvas. As the groundskeeper, Amelia had an intimate relationship with every blade of grass, every blooming rose, every whispering leaf. She knew the secrets whispered by the wind through the branches, the stories etched in the bark of the ancient oaks, and the silent language spoken by the wildflowers that dotted the landscape.  

But this morning, a disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the morning mist. A sense of unease settled upon Amelia like a shroud. It was more than the unsettling stillness of the manor, usually alive with the chirping of birds and the rustling of squirrels. There was an emptiness here, a void that felt both familiar and profoundly alien. 


This feeling gnawed at her as she began her daily rounds, starting with the rose garden. The delicate petals were marred by an unnatural browning, their vibrant hues fading to dusty shades. It wasn't disease or pests; this was something else entirely, a creeping decay that chilled Amelia to her bones. As she moved deeper into the gardens, other plants withered and died, leaving behind brittle husks where life had once flourished. The once vibrant tapestry of Oakhaven Manor was turning gray.
