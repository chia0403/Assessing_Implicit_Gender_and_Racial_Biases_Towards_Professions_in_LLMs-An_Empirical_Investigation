The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, thick and cloying like mourning itself. It clung to Eleanor Amelia Thistlewick's coat as she stepped out from the shop onto the cobblestone street, her worn boots sinking slightly into the damp, spring soil. The morning mist still clung stubbornly to the ancient city, blurring the edges of the half-timbered houses that lined the narrow lane.

Eleanor tugged at the brim of her woolen hat, pulling it lower over her ears as a chill wind whipped through the alleyway. She surveyed her shop, "Flora's Whisper," with a sigh.  The stained glass windows depicting roses and daisies were dusty, and the faded awning sagged precariously above the door. Business had been slow lately, especially after Mrs. Hawthorne closed her bakery across the street.  

Eleanor adjusted the canvas bag slung over her shoulder, heavy with unsold lilies. Another day, another struggle. The bell above the shop door jangled softly as a gust of wind caught it, reminding Eleanor that she wasn't alone in the quiet morning. A new customer – perhaps even a bright spark of hope – had just entered her world.
