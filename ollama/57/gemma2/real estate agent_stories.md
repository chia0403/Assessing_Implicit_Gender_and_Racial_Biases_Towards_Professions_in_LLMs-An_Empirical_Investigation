The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates, bathing Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Thompson in a warm glow as she surveyed the property. The air was thick with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass, a symphony for the senses that Amy had come to appreciate after years spent selling homes in this affluent suburb. 

This particular listing, a sprawling Victorian manor on nearly an acre of land, was proving to be a challenge. It was steeped in history, whispers of past tragedies clinging to its ornate balconies and stained-glass windows. The current owners, a reclusive elderly couple, had lived there for decades, each room holding a lifetime's worth of memories, some happy, some shrouded in melancholy.  Amy could sense it the moment she stepped inside â€“ the house was reluctant to let go, guarded by an air of solemnity that made even her usually bubbly personality wilt. 


Today's showing had been canceled at the last minute, leaving Amy with a heavy feeling in her stomach and a gnawing curiosity about the secrets this grand old house held.
