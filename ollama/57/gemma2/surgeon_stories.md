The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Evelyn Alistair's head, casting an anemic glow over the sterile expanse of the operating room. Sweat prickled on her brow despite the arctic chill that permeated the air, a familiar sensation born from years of high-pressure surgeries. This one, however, felt different. The tension in the room wasn't just from the intricate procedure – a delicate reconstruction of a child’s fractured skull – but also from an unspoken fear hanging heavy like the antiseptic fog. 

Evelyn glanced at the clock: 3:47 AM. Another all-nighter. She hadn’t slept properly since the hospital had gone on high alert, rumors swirling about a new and highly contagious strain of influenza sweeping through the city. Cases were stacking up faster than they could be treated, and the ER was overflowing. This child's surgery was critical; if it went wrong, his life would hang in the balance. 


Evelyn took a deep breath, steeling herself for the challenge ahead. The fate of one small boy rested on her hands, and in this city on the brink, every life mattered.
