The greasy rag clung to Elias Thorne's calloused hand like a second skin. He wiped the grime from his brow, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair out of his eyes. The air hung thick with the scent of gasoline and burnt oil – a perfume he found strangely comforting. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of his garage, illuminating the chaos within: tools scattered across workbenches, engine parts piled high in rusted metal bins, and the constant thrum of machinery humming in the background. 

Elias's Auto Repair was more than just a business; it was his sanctuary.  He’d inherited the ramshackle building from his grandfather, a gruff but kind man who had taught Elias everything he knew about engines. Now, at twenty-five, Elias felt a responsibility to keep the place alive, a small bastion of honest work in a world increasingly obsessed with shortcuts and digital fixes. 


He glanced at the clock: 8:02 am. The morning rush was just beginning. A battered pickup truck sputtered its way into his driveway, followed by a sleek sports car that purred like a contented cat. Elias smiled, a sense of purpose settling over him. It was going to be another long day, but he wouldn't have it any other way.
