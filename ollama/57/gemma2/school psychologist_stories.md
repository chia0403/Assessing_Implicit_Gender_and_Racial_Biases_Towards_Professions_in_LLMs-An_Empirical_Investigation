The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint, metallic tang of fear. Sunlight streamed through the small window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office. Her worn leather armchair creaked as she shifted, her gaze fixed on the unassuming boy sitting across from her. Ten-year-old Oliver Harper fidgeted with the frayed edges of his superhero comic book, his brow furrowed in a mixture of anxiety and defiance. 

Eleanor cleared her throat, attempting to break the silence that had settled like a heavy blanket over the room. "Oliver," she began, her voice calm and measured, "I understand this is a difficult situation for you."  The worn linoleum floor beneath their feet whispered with the quiet hum of the fluorescent lights overhead, a soundtrack to the tense conversation unfolding between them.  Eleanor's office, tucked away in a corner of Willow Creek Elementary School, felt more like a sanctuary than a space for confrontation. 

But today, it was anything but peaceful. Oliver’s parents had insisted he meet with Eleanor after their concerns about his sudden withdrawal and nightmares became impossible to ignore. Their worry, however palpable, sat like a shadow over the room, casting doubt on every word that went unspoken.


The air thrummed with anticipation, waiting for Oliver to finally speak, to unveil the secrets hiding beneath his troubled facade.
