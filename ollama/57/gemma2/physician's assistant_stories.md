The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop like a miniature drumbeat echoing Amelia Hayes’ unease.  She paced behind the flimsy counter, her white coat slick with condensation, eyes flicking nervously between the digital clock and the door. It was nearing 8 pm, well past closing time, and Dr. Singh was still nowhere to be seen.

Amelia ran a hand through her damp brown hair, pushing back the stray strands that clung to her forehead. This remote outpost in rural Montana, aptly named Dustbowl Creek, had its charms – breathtaking sunsets, quiet nights punctuated by the chirping of crickets, and a community that embraced you like family. But moments like this, when the only light source was the flickering fluorescent bulb overhead and every rustle outside sounded like an intruder, made her long for the bustle and reassurance of the city.  

Dustbowl Creek relied on Dr. Singh, their only physician, and she, Amelia Hayes, his physician assistant, was all that stood between him and a potential disaster when he inevitably overbooked himself and vanished into the unforgiving wilderness to tend to emergencies. But tonight, with the storm raging and the phone dead again, Amelia felt utterly alone.  

A sudden clap of thunder shook the building, making her jump. Then, a muffled thump followed by a groan from outside sent a shiver down her spine. Taking a deep breath, Amelia grabbed the heavy flashlight on the counter and cautiously made her way towards the door, every instinct screaming at her to stay put.
