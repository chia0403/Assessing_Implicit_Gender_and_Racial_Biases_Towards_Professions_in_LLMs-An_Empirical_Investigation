The Nevada desert bled into a shimmering horizon, the sun a molten disc sinking towards the rusted mesas. Heat shimmered off the asphalt ribbon that snaked its way through the desolate landscape.  A lone semi-trailer truck, a behemoth painted in faded blues and greens, rumbled past, kicking up dust devils that danced like phantoms in the dying light. At the wheel sat Silas Clayton Jr., his weathered face etched with the lines of countless sunrises and sleepless nights on the road. His calloused hands gripped the steering wheel, navigating the endless curves of Highway 95 with practiced ease.  

Silas was a man of routine, fueled by coffee, cigarettes, and the open highway. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling unease crawled under his skin, a sensation he couldn't shake off even as he hummed along to a classic country tune on the radio. His usual stoicism seemed to be fraying at the edges, replaced by an anxious anticipation that gnawed at him like a desert rat scavenging for scraps. He glanced at the rearview mirror, checking for a phantom threat behind him, but saw only the endless expanse of dust and fading twilight. 


His destination was Ely, Nevada, a sleepy town nestled among the mountains. Silas had delivered there before, always passing through without incident. But tonight, something about the desolate stretch of highway ahead whispered a warning in his gut. He didn't know what to expect, but he knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that this trip wouldn't be like any other.
