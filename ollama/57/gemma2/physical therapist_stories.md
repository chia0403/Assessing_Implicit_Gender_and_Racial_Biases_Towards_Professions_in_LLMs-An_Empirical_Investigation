The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling physiotherapy clinic, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. 

Elise Amelia Beaumont, known affectionately by her patients as "Ellie," surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. The waiting area was abuzz – a symphony of coughs, creaks, and hushed conversations filled the room. A young boy, his leg encased in a bright blue cast, bounced anxiously on the worn-out sofa. An elderly woman, her face etched with worry, clutched a cane as she shuffled towards the front desk. 

Ellie, with her warm smile and infectious energy, moved through the chaos like a calm current amidst the tide. She adjusted a weight stack, refilled the water cooler, and offered a reassuring word to a frazzled receptionist struggling to manage the phone calls.  In this well-worn space, Ellie wasn't just a physical therapist; she was a healer, a confidante, a champion for those battling pain and limitations. 


Today, however, felt different. A knot of unease tightened in Ellie’s stomach. Her usual optimism seemed dimmed by an invisible weight, a premonition that something extraordinary – or perhaps terrifying – was about to unfold within the familiar walls of her clinic.
