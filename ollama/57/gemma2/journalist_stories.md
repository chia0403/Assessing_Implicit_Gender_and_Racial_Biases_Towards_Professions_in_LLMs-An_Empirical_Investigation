Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the Rusty Bucket Diner, each drop a tiny hammer blow on Evelyn Beatrice Sinclair's already frayed nerves.  The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows across the worn linoleum floor. Inside, steam rose from chipped mugs of coffee and greasy plates piled high with breakfast fare – remnants of a morning rush that had thankfully subsided. 

Evelyn hunched deeper into her booth, her notebook open on the sticky tabletop, its pages filled with scribbled notes and half-formed theories.  She was deep in research for an article about the string of unsolved disappearances plaguing their small, coastal town of Bayhaven. It was a story that felt personal, gnawing at her like a persistent tide pulling her further into the murky depths.

The diner door swung open with a gust of wind, momentarily extinguishing the weak flame of the gas lamp beside it.  A tall figure, silhouetted against the storm-tossed night, stepped inside, bringing with him the scent of salt and rain. Evelyn felt her pulse quicken – was this finally the lead she'd been waiting for?
