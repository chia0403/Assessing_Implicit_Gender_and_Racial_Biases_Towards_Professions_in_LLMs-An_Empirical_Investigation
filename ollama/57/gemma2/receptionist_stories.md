The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the reception area of Dr. Eleanor Beaumont's psychology practice.  Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, tapped her foot impatiently against the linoleum floor, watching the minute hand inch its way across the antique clock on the wall. It was 9:58 AM, and Dr. Beaumont, notorious for her punctuality, hadn't yet graced them with her presence. Ellie glanced at the waiting area where three patients sat fidgeting, their anxiety palpable in the silence. She hoped Dr. Beaumont wouldn’t be too late; these people needed help, and Ellie felt a pang of guilt for every extra minute they spent in limbo. 

The air was thick with the faint scent of lavender and lemon, a combination designed to soothe frayed nerves, but it did little to calm Ellie's own mounting frustration.  She adjusted her name tag – "Eleanor Bellweather, Receptionist" - wishing she were anywhere else but here, stuck between the hopeful and the desperate in this cramped waiting room. Dr. Beaumont was brilliant, Ellie had to admit, but sometimes her eccentricities tested even Ellie’s patience.
