The sticky fingerprints on the crayon-drawn picture clutched in Amelia "Amy" Beaumont's hand felt strangely poignant. She traced the wobbly lines depicting a sun, a stick figure waving, and what was supposed to be a dog with an extra head – a masterpiece crafted by six-year-old Leo during his last day at Willow Creek daycare. Amy smiled sadly, her heart heavy as she glanced around the now-empty playroom. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the worn carpet, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The familiar scent of hand sanitizer and peanut butter sandwiches lingered, a bittersweet reminder of countless laughter-filled mornings and tearful goodbyes. Willow Creek was more than just a daycare; it was a haven for children, a second home filled with the echoes of tiny voices, the clatter of blocks, and the gentle hum of Amy's comforting lullabies. 

But today, an emptiness hung in the air, a silence that amplified the finality of Leo's departure. He and his family were moving to another state, taking a piece of Willow Creek with them – a bittersweet reality Amy had come to accept over her ten years at the daycare.
