The whir of the ultrasonic scaler was the soundtrack to Amelia Rose Cartwright's life. Each high-pitched vibration, each gentle scrape against enamel, was a familiar lullaby in her world of pearly whites and bad breath.  She stood in the sterile, brightly lit office, a blue scrub top straining at the seams over her impossibly toned physique. The aroma of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional floral scent wafting from Mrs. Periwinkle's lavender hand sanitizer. This was Amelia's domain â€“ Comfort Dental Care, nestled amongst the quaint shops and cafes on Maple Street in a sleepy town named Oakhaven. 


But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine as she prepped for her first patient, Mr. Henderson, a man notorious for his chipped tooth and even worse stories about his escapades at the local fishing pier. He was late, unusually so, and Amelia found herself staring at the clock, the familiar whirring of the scaler suddenly sounding discordant in the quiet office.
