The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed like angry hornets above Eleanor Penelope Brightwell’s head as she sat at her cluttered desk, sifting through a stack of college brochures that seemed to multiply overnight. The air in the cramped guidance office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and nervous energy, a familiar aroma that clung to this small corner of Northwood High like a second skin.  Outside, the late summer sun beat down on the sprawling asphalt playground, a chaotic symphony of squealing children and echoing laughter that offered a stark contrast to the hushed anxieties within her office walls. Eleanor sighed, pushing aside a brochure for Harvard (another one?) and pulled out a file labeled "Thompson, Liam." This wasn't just another student facing the daunting prospect of college applications; this was Liam Thompson, star athlete, class president, and the boy who always seemed to have it all figured out. Yet, here he was, his usually confident demeanor replaced with a furrowed brow and hesitant silence.  Eleanor had a feeling Liam’s story wasn't going to be as straightforward as she expected.
