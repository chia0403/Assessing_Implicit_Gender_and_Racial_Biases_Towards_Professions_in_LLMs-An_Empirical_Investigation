The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Beatrice Finchâ€™s head like a chorus of restless bees. Their buzz mingled with the low murmur of the grocery store aisles and the rhythmic beeping of her cash register, creating a soundtrack as familiar as her own heartbeat.  Elara swiped a plastic bag of pre-sliced peaches across the scanner, its barcode chirping in response. 

She worked the night shift at SuperMart #7, a sprawling concrete edifice on the outskirts of Willow Creek, a town where dreams went to die and the only thing that ever truly blossomed were weeds along the cracked sidewalks.  Elara knew every inch of this store: the chipped linoleum floor tiles, the dusty shelves lined with forgotten snacks, the flickering 'Out of Order' sign perpetually hanging over the malfunctioning coffee machine.  She was as much a fixture as the rusty shopping carts and the faded welcome mat that read "Welcome to SuperMart #7 - Where Everyday is Fresh!" (The irony wasn't lost on her.)


Despite the monotonous routine, Elara found a strange comfort in the predictable rhythms of the night shift. The empty aisles felt like a sanctuary, offering a quiet respite from the cacophony of daytime life. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, as if she were being watched. She glanced around, but saw only the usual shadows playing tricks in the fluorescent light.  Perhaps it was just another lonely night in Willow Creek getting to her.
