Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Gus "The Wrench" Watterson's plumbing van, mirroring the storm brewing inside him.  He wasn't just stuck on a backroad in rural Mississippi, miles from civilization and any semblance of decent coffee - he was late for the biggest job of his career. The leaky pipes at the opulent Blackwood Manor weren't just any old drain; they belonged to the enigmatic and notoriously reclusive billionaire, Alistair Blackwood. Gus had spent weeks prepping for this call, picturing himself as a hero wielding wrenches instead of swords, conquering the plumbing behemoth that haunted Blackwood Manor. Now, with each passing minute, he felt his carefully constructed confidence dissolving like a penny in acid.

The muddy road snaked its way through dense, ancient oaks draped in Spanish moss. Each turn threatened to reveal another pitfall - a fallen tree, a flooded ditch, or worse, the ghosts of Mississippi legends whispering tales of misfortune to those who dared venture into these forgotten corners. Gus, however, wasn't one for ghost stories; his only fear was running out of time and facing Blackwood's notoriously short fuse. 

He gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white against the worn leather, and muttered a prayer to whatever plumbing gods might be listening.  "Just get me there in one piece, please," he whispered, "and then maybe, just maybe, I can finally afford a decent cup of coffee."
