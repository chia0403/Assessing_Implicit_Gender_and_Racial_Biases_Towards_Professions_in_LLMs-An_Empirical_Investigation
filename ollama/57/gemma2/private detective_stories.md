Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Daniel Alistair Finch's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow on his already frayed nerves. The flickering neon sign outside, advertising "Finch Investigations: Truth in Every Shadow," buzzed erratically, mirroring the storm raging both inside and out. 

Daniel, a man whose face bore the etched lines of countless sleepless nights and even more unsavory encounters, stared out at the slick streets of New Haven. The city, usually teeming with life, was now reduced to a blurred canvas of neon reflections and rushing water.  He cradled a lukewarm mug of coffee, its bitter taste doing little to soothe the gnawing tension in his gut. A phone call had just come in – his fourth client this week claiming their loved one had vanished without a trace. 

This wasn't like most cases. There was a desperation in the caller's voice, a fear that clung to the words like the damp chill of the storm. Daniel felt it, too, a prickling sensation on the back of his neck, a warning that this case would be different. It wouldn't just be another puzzle to solve, another missing person found safe and sound. This one… this one felt dangerous.
