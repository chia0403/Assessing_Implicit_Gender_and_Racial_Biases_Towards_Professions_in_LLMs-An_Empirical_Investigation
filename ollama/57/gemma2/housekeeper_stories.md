The scent of lemon polish clung to Elara Beatrice Finch like a second skin. It was a smell she knew intimately, a comforting familiarity amidst the whirlwind chaos that often consumed the grand manor house she called home. The year was 1927, and Highcliff Hall, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall, was in its usual state of disarray - a testament to the eccentric whims of its current inhabitants, the Davenport family. Elara, ever the silent observer, watched from behind her feather duster as the youngest son, Theodore, attempted to teach his pet parrot, Esmeralda, to recite Shakespeare with disastrous results. The bird squawked a garbled rendition of Hamlet's "To be or not to be," while Theodore fumed and Esmeralda preened contentedly on his shoulder.  

Elara sighed, her breath misting in the chill autumn air that seeped through the drafty halls. This was just another Tuesday at Highcliff Hall. A symphony of chaos orchestrated by a family teetering on the edge of both brilliance and absurdity. And Elara, with her keen eye for order and unwavering loyalty, was the only one who could keep the ship from sinking entirely.
