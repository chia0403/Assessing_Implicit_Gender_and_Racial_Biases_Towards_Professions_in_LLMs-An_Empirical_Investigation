The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Amelia Celeste's head, casting a sterile, sickly yellow glow over the cramped examination room. A faint scent of disinfectant clung to the air, mingling with the cloying sweetness of Mrs. Peterson’s hand lotion. Amelia sighed, leaning back against the cool metal wall. It was 3:47 am, and she was already on her third round of double-shifts this week. The exhaustion felt like lead in her bones, a dull ache that spread through every muscle.

Outside the window, the city slumbered under a blanket of darkness. Occasionally, a stray car would rumble past, its headlights briefly illuminating the rain-slicked asphalt below. Amelia watched it disappear into the gloom, a lonely speck against the vastness of the night. The ER was quiet tonight, just her and the occasional frantic nurse making her rounds.  She missed the vibrant pulse of the city, the laughter and the chatter that filled the air during the day. But now, all she heard were the rhythmic beeps of monitors and the hushed whispers of patients fighting for their breath.


Amelia wished for a quiet cup of coffee and a moment of peace, but duty called. A harried nurse poked her head in, “Dr. Celeste? We have another one coming in - possible cardiac arrest.”  

Amelia straightened, pushing down the fatigue that threatened to consume her. It was always like this, neverending, always urgent. But she wouldn't let it break her. Not tonight.
