The air in Evelyn Beatrice Clementine's studio hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and regret. Outside, London pulsed with life, but inside, only dust motes danced in the pale afternoon light filtering through the grimy windowpane.  Evelyn ran a calloused thumb over the unfinished canvas stretched before her, its white surface mockingly pristine. She'd been at it for weeks, grappling with a piece commissioned by the prestigious Tate Modern. "Modern London: A Tapestry of Hope," they called it. 

Hope. The word felt as alien to Evelyn as the polished marble floors of the museum she was expected to grace.  Her own life had become a tangled mess of missed deadlines, dwindling savings, and an unshakeable feeling that her artistic spark was slowly fading like a forgotten ember. London, once a vibrant canvas for her imagination, now felt like a suffocating labyrinth of grey buildings and even greyer dreams.
