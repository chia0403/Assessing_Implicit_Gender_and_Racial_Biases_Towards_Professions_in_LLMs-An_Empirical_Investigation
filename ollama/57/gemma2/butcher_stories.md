The rhythmic thunk of cleaver on bone echoed through "Hawthorn & Hunt," a symphony only Elias Hawthorne truly understood.  He hummed along to the tune, sweat beading on his brow as he expertly carved through a thick ribcage, separating it from the rest of the beast with practiced ease. The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and blood, mingled with the sharp tang of rosemary and thyme used in the daily marinades. Outside, London's cobbled streets bustled with life, but within the butcher's shop, time seemed to stand still.

Elias Hawthorne, a man carved from the same sturdy oak as his workbench, surveyed his domain with a practiced eye. Sunlight filtered through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the rows of glistening carcasses hanging from hooks overhead. The shop was more than just his livelihood; it was his legacy, passed down through generations of Hawthornes, each leaving their mark on its worn floorboards and well-seasoned chopping block. 


This morning, however, felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Elias' spine as he watched the bustling street outside. There were whispers in the air, murmurs of a stranger in town, someone who dealt in secrets and shadows. Something about it unsettled him, tugging at the back of his mind like an untied thread.  Elias shook off the feeling, attributing it to nerves stemming from the upcoming market day. He had a reputation to uphold - that of the best butcher in London. And he wouldn't let anything, not even a whisper on the wind, stand in his way.
