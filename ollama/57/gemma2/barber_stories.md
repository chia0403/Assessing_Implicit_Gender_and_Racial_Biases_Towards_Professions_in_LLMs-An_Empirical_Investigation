The air hung heavy with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a familiar balm to Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzwilliam's senses. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness of his shop, "Fitzwilliam's Fine Cuts," on a Tuesday morning just shy of dawn. The street outside was still cloaked in pre-dawn gloom, save for the flickering gaslight that cast long, distorted shadows across the cobblestones. 

Bart leaned back against the worn mahogany counter, idly polishing a pair of shears with his sleeve. He hadn't had a customer yet this morning. It wasn't unusual; most folks preferred to get their hair cut after they'd had their breakfast and done some errands. But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unseen energy, a subtle shift in the usual humdrum of his corner of London. Perhaps it was just the lingering scent of the pipe tobacco he'd smoked the night before, or maybe... there was something more.
