The sunrise was a bruised purple smear on the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cracked asphalt.  Edgar Montgomery squinted through the dust that hung heavy in the air, a familiar grit settling in his throat. He shifted the weight of his work gloves on his calloused hands and tugged his battered baseball cap further down over his forehead. Another day, another mile stretch of Route 35 to mend. 

Edgar was a highway worker, through and through. His life was paved with asphalt, punctuated by the rumble of passing trucks and the occasional screech of brakes.  The rhythmic swing of his hammer, the dull scrape of a shovel against gravel – these were the melodies that composed his days. He knew every pothole, every bend in the road, every rust-eaten culvert like an old friend. And today, just like any other day, he was determined to make this stretch of highway safe for weary travelers. 


The setting sun cast a long shadow over Edgar Montgomery as he surveyed the freshly paved stretch of Route 35. A hawk circled lazily overhead, its cry echoing through the stillness of the fading light. The air was still warm from the day’s heat, but a hint of autumn chill lingered in the breeze.
