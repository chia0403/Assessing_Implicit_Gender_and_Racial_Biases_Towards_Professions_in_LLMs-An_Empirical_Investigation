The amber glow of the “Last Call” sign cast long shadows across the worn mahogany bar, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air.  A lone figure hunched over a glass of whiskey, its contents swirling like embers in the dim light. This was Bartholomew "Bart" Alistair Finch, and this was his kingdom – The Rusty Mug, a dive bar tucked away on a forgotten side street in New Orleans. 

It was past midnight, and the usual after-hours crowd had dwindled to a handful of regulars nursing their sorrows or celebrating their victories, depending on the night. Bart knew them all by name, their stories etched into his memory like constellations in the smoky sky above.  He poured another shot for Mrs. Dubois, whose grief over her late husband lingered like cheap perfume, and winked at Frankie, a trumpet player with a grin wider than the Mississippi River.

But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up Bart's spine, as if the silence itself held a secret waiting to be unraveled. He glanced towards the door, half expecting someone to walk in, someone new, someone who would change everything.   


The humid New Orleans air hung heavy outside The Rusty Mug, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain. A symphony of crickets chirped from the alleyway behind the bar, their song a counterpoint to the melancholic hum of jazz filtering through the cracked windows.  A neon sign flickered erratically across the street, casting an unsettling green light on the cobblestones below.
