The rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of tiny brushes against polished nails was the soundtrack to Eloise Clementine Dubois' life.  Her world was contained within the plush velvet chairs of "Nails by Elise," her own little salon tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Paris. The air hummed with the scent of lavender hand cream, fresh coffee, and a hint of nail polish remover - a comforting trifecta that had become as familiar to Eloise as her own heartbeat. Outside, the city throbbed with life, a symphony of car horns, chattering tourists, and the lilting voices of street vendors, but inside "Nails by Elise," everything moved at a gentler pace.  It was a sanctuary, a place where women came not just for manicures, but for conversation, confidences, and a moment of quiet escape from the Parisian whirlwind. 


Today, Eloise's chair was occupied by Madame Dupont, a retired opera singer who regaled her with tales of backstage drama and the legendary tenor she’d once shared the stage with. But as Eloise expertly filed Madame Dupont’s nails into perfectly tapered ovals, her gaze drifted out the window, towards the bustling street beyond.  There, amidst the familiar chaos, something new caught her eye - a young man with eyes that seemed to hold both curiosity and a hint of sadness, standing outside her shop, watching.
