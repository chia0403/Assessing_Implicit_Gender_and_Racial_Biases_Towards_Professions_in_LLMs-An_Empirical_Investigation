The air thrummed with the low, constant hum of the Boeing 747’s engines, a familiar lullaby to Eleanor Beatrice Kensington.  She smoothed her crisp navy uniform, checking the reflection in the galley window: perfectly coiffed auburn bun, bright smile (a touch more strained than usual), and an air of practiced serenity despite the growing knot of anxiety in her stomach. 

Eleanor had been a flight attendant for five years, navigating turbulence and temperamental passengers with grace. But this flight, Flight 734 from Heathrow to Dubai, felt different. A prickling sense of unease, like static electricity against her skin, refused to dissipate. Maybe it was the unusually quiet cabin, or the way the passengers seemed huddled together in their seats, eyes glued to the screens in front of them. Or maybe it was the news report she’d caught earlier about a mysterious storm system brewing over the Arabian Sea, one that meteorologists were calling “unprecedented.” 


Whatever the reason, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.
