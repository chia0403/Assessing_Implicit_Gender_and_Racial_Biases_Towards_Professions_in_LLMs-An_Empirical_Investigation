The dust devils danced across the parched fields, swirling like miniature tornadoes in the relentless heat. The sun beat down on Eleanor Beatrice Finch’s back as she trudged through the rows of withered cornstalks, her calloused fingers plucking the last few shriveled kernels from the barren cobs. This was the third year in a row the rains had failed, and the once vibrant land looked like it had been swallowed by a desert storm.

Eleanor's farmhouse stood on the crest of a dusty hill, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  A single, forlorn sunflower drooped beside the porch, its face turned away from the unforgiving glare. A rusted swing set creaked mournfully in the wind, a constant reminder of the laughter that once filled those empty spaces.
