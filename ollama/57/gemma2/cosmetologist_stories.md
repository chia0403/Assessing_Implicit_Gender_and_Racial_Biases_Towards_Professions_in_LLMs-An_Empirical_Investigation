The scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill November wind whipping outside. Inside "Vanity & Vogue," hair dryers hummed a gentle symphony, punctuated by the click-clack of manicurist Amelia Rose Cartwright's perfectly manicured nails as she expertly applied gel polish to a client's chipped thumbnail.  

Amelia, with her cascade of auburn curls held back in a neat bun and a floral tattoo peeking from beneath her crisp white lab coat, was the heart of the salon.  A master colorist and stylist with an uncanny ability to transform clients into their desired avatars, she had built a reputation for magic as potent as any potion.   But today, a new kind of magic was about to unfold, one that would weave its way through Amelia's carefully constructed world, threatening to unravel everything she knew. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. A woman stood on the threshold, shrouded in darkness and rain, her face obscured by the wide brim of a hat.  Amelia felt a prickle of unease, an instinct warning her that this client was not like the others. This one carried secrets â€“ secrets that would soon be laid bare under the warm glow of Vanity & Vogue's neon sign.
