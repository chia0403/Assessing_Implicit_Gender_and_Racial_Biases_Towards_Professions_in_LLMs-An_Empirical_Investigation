The rhythmic clang of metal against stone filled Silas Thorne's ears, a familiar lullaby that usually soothed his weary bones. Tonight, however, it grated on him like rusted armor. The moon hung fat and low in the sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the courtyard of Castle Ebonhaven. Each gust of wind sent shivers down Silas’ spine, making him tug tighter at the thick wool cloak that barely kept the biting chill at bay.

He was a veteran guard, his weathered face etched with years spent patrolling these cold, imposing walls. Tonight, though, duty felt like an oppressive weight, heavier than the bronze sword hanging at his hip. His mind wandered to the warmth of his wife's hearth, the comforting aroma of her stew and the laughter of their children.  But duty called, and Silas Thorne, loyal sentinel of Ebonhaven, would answer. 


The castle itself loomed over him, a gothic behemoth of black stone crowned with jagged towers that clawed at the night sky.  Its history was as deep and dark as the moat surrounding it, whispered in hushed tones by locals – tales of powerful sorcerers, imprisoned demons, and ancient curses. Silas had heard them all, dismissed them all as superstitious ramblings. Or so he'd told himself. 

He glanced at the lone flickering lamppost beside the main gate, its weak light struggling to pierce the encroaching darkness. Beyond it, the forest stretched out like a hungry beast, its gnarled branches clawing at the sky. He wasn't afraid of the dark, not really. It was the silence that unnerved him, the way it amplified every rustle of leaves, every creak of the ancient wood beneath his feet. 


Silas Thorne, ever vigilant, drew a deep breath and steeled himself for another night on watch. He could handle any shadow, any whisper in the wind. That's what guards did. They protected the innocent, stood against the darkness. But tonight, something felt different. Tonight, he had a nagging feeling that the darkness might be fighting back.
