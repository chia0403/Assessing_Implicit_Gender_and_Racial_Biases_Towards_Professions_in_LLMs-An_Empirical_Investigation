The bell shrieked its final note, releasing a tidal wave of chattering third graders into the hallway. Miss Eleanor Willowbrook sighed, smoothing down her floral-patterned dress with tired hands. 

Eleanorâ€™s classroom, nestled on the second floor of Elmwood Elementary, had been transformed from a haven of learning into a chaotic playground for the last hour. Crayons littered the floor like fallen soldiers, and the scent of glue and glitter hung heavy in the air. She glanced at the clock, its hands ticking towards the dreaded four o'clock dismissal. 

Another day survived. Tomorrow promised more spilled juice boxes, misplaced homework assignments, and endless questions about the mating habits of earthworms.  But for now, Eleanor craved the quiet solitude of her empty classroom, a sanctuary where she could sip lukewarm tea and plan for another whirlwind week with her thirty rambunctious students.
