The acrid tang of burnt wiring hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sickly sweet scent of disinfectant from the overflowing trash can in the corner.  Flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows on Elias Thorne’s face as he bent over the mangled electrical panel. It looked like a battleground, wires sparking and sputtering like wounded serpents, circuit breakers groaning under an impossible load. 

Elias wasn't fazed. This was his world – the humming symphony of power, the silent dance of electrons, the comforting weight of tools in his calloused hands. He ran a hand over the worn leather of his tool belt, feeling the reassuring solidity of his trusty hammer and screwdrivers nestled against his hip. Tonight, though, even Elias Thorne, master electrician and fearless problem solver, felt a prickle of unease. 

The rundown diner on the edge of town wasn't known for its high-profile clientele, but tonight was different. The usual greasy spoon regulars were gone, replaced by a group of men huddled in the shadows, their faces obscured by wide-brimmed hats and trench coats. Elias could feel their gazes boring into him as he worked, like hungry wolves sizing up their prey. 


Elias Thorne wasn't afraid of much. But something about these men, their whispered conversations laced with menace, sent a shiver down his spine. He tightened his grip on his tools and prepared to face whatever darkness this night might bring.
