The air hung heavy with sawdust and the scent of pine. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of Elias Thornwood's workshop, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness. Outside, the town of Oakhaven stirred to life, but within these walls, time seemed to move at its own languid pace. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously chiseled a delicate carving into a sturdy oak door. Each strike of his mallet resonated through the quiet space, a rhythmic pulse against the backdrop of birdsong filtering through the open window. He was crafting more than just a door; he was building a story, one painstakingly detailed piece at a time.  

This wasn't just any commission. This door was destined for the town's oldest house, a grand Victorian manor known as Whispering Pines, which had been vacant for decades, shrouded in whispers and local legends. Elias felt a thrill of anticipation; the history woven into every inch of the mansion intrigued him, and he yearned to be part of its revival. He hoped this door would become the portal through which a new chapter unfolded.
