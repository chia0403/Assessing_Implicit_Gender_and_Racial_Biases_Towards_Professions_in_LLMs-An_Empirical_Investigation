The air in Alistair Finch's office hummed with the anxious energy of closing bell. Every click of his keyboard echoed like gunfire in the hushed space, punctuated by the frantic clatter of phones ringing unanswered. Outside the panoramic window, the Manhattan skyline shimmered under a bruised, pre-storm sky, mirroring the turmoil brewing within him. 

Alistair, a stock broker with a reputation for both ruthlessness and uncanny insight, felt a familiar prickle of dread crawl up his spine. He wasn't worried about losing money – he thrived on risk, lived for the adrenaline rush of navigating volatile markets. No, this was different. This was personal. His gaze flicked to a framed photograph on his desk: a younger Alistair, beaming alongside a woman with eyes that held galaxies and a smile as bright as the sun. Amelia. His wife, lost to cancer just six months ago. 

His phone buzzed, shattering the silence. "Finch," he growled into the receiver, his voice laced with steel.  "What's happening?"


The news hit him like a physical blow. A rogue trader, known only as “The Serpent,” had infiltrated a rival firm and was orchestrating a systematic takedown of major players. Alistair knew in an instant this wasn’t just about money; it was a calculated vendetta. And he suspected The Serpent's targets weren't random – they were the names on Amelia's medical bills.
