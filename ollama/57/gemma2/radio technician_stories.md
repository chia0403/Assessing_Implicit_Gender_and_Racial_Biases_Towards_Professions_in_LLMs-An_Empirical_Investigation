The static crackled in Elijah Alistair Finch's ear like a thousand cicadas in heat. He adjusted the headphones, wincing as the faint hum of interference buzzed against his eardrums. "Anything on channel 7?" he muttered into the microphone, his voice barely audible over the din. The reply was met with silence, only the insistent hum growing louder.

Elijah was alone in the cramped radio shack nestled deep within the bowels of the abandoned lighthouse. Salt spray clung to the peeling paint and rusted metal, and the air was thick with the scent of mildew and forgotten dreams. Outside, the storm raged, waves crashing against the crumbling stone base, each blow echoing through the hollow tower like a death knell. 

He ran his fingers over the dials, searching for any sign of life amidst the static storm. The lighthouse had been decommissioned years ago, its light replaced by modern technology that deemed it obsolete. Now, it served as little more than a relic, a lonely sentinel against the unforgiving sea. But Elijah refused to let it fall into complete ruin. He poured his heart and soul into keeping its radio operational, clinging to the hope that someday, someone out there might be listening.
