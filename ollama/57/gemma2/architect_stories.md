The midday sun beat down on the steel scaffolding surrounding St. Michael’s Cathedral, turning the air above the construction site into a shimmering haze. Sweat dripped from Amelia Rose Hawthorne's brow as she adjusted her hardhat and squinted at the blueprints clutched in her gloved hand. The intricate details of the cathedral's renovation -  its soaring vaulted ceilings, delicate stained glass windows, and ancient stonework – were a constant source of inspiration for Amelia. Yet, today, frustration gnawed at her. 

The city council had insisted on adding a modern glass dome to the structure, a decision that felt like a betrayal of the cathedral's timeless beauty.  Amelia could picture it now: the jarring contrast between the ancient stone and the sleek, transparent addition, a monument to progress clashing with history. She sighed, knowing that her voice as an architect, even one as respected as herself, held little sway against the whims of the council. 


**Setting:** A bustling city in the late summer, characterized by intense heat, construction noise, and the historical grandeur juxtaposed with modern development.

Amelia Rose Hawthorne, a talented but frustrated architect, finds herself grappling with the ethical dilemma of balancing preservation with progress as she oversees the renovation of St. Michael's Cathedral.
