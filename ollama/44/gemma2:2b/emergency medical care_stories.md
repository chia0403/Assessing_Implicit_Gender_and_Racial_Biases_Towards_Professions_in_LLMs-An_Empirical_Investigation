## The Whispering Engine

**Setting:**  A dusty, sun-baked highway in rural Wyoming, 2023. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, kicking up plumes of red earth as the afternoon stretched into twilight. A lone gas station stood sentinel on the horizon, its fluorescent light flickering like a dying ember against the deepening blue.

**Character:**  Emery Blackwood, a young EMT with calloused hands and eyes that held the weary wisdom of someone who had witnessed too much darkness in life's journey. He was everything you wouldn't expect from a man named Emery: quiet, almost shy, save for his steely focus when he stood among chaos.

**Opening:** The siren wailed again, slicing through the silence like a scalpel.  Emery’s head instinctively jerked towards the sound, a familiar tension pulling at his chest. This time it wasn't another call of "car accident" or "medical emergency." This was different - heavier, dirtier, and laced with an unsettling fear that clung to the air around him like morning mist. He felt it in the way the radio crackled, the way Sheriff Thompson’s weathered face had gone white as a ghost when he first told him about it. The engine of this call, however, whispered something darker than anything Emery had ever encountered before.

**Prompt:**  What kind of emergency is taking place? What makes the situation so different and troubling for Emery?
