Rain lashed against the towering windows of the Grand Blackwood office building, blurring the neon lights of Times Square into shimmering streaks of colour. Inside, Amelia Thorne's fingers flew across the keyboard, her eyes glued to the screen as she typed furiously. Despite the oppressive storm outside, Amelia couldn't escape the feeling of an unseen hand gripping her heart. The air was thick with tension, each keystroke amplifying the anxiety gnawing at her gut. 

Her boss, Mr. Blackwood himself, a man whose stern eyes seemed to pierce through her very soul, was on the line. His voice, low and gravelly, crackled across the speakers like static in a storm. "Amelia," he began, his tone laced with an urgency that sent a shiver down her spine.  "There's been a development." 

It wasn’t just any development. It was the kind of news that made Amelia’s stomach churn and forced her to take a deep breath before continuing to type, each word a prayer for survival. She sat back in her chair, staring at the reflection of the storm raging outside in the polished chrome surface of her desk. 
 
This wasn't just another Tuesday. Tonight, everything changed.
