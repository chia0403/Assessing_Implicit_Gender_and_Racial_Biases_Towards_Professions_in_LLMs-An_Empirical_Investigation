Rain lashed against the boarded-up windows of The Rusty Quill, mirroring the storm raging inside Amelia Wright’s gut.  The name on the faded wooden doorsign felt alien to her mouth – once it had been home, a sanctuary where stories were spun and truth was served steaming from mugs of strong black coffee. Now, it held only memories and echoes of laughter long gone. 

Amelia, a reporter with more grit than grace and an ever-present cynicism that could curdle milk, was supposed to be interviewing the new owner - Mr. Blackwood – about his plans for the town’s most infamous haunt: The Quill Inn, now a shell of its former glory after years of neglect. It wasn't just about the stories she yearned to write; it was about proving her city-wide reputation as a tenacious reporter worthy of respect.  

She huddled deeper in her threadbare coat, letting the chill seep into the bones beneath her thin shirt. The wind whistled like a mournful banshee through the alleyway, pulling at her worn boots and whispering tales she couldn't quite decipher.
