The crisp air of Paris carried a promise of rain, tangling with the scent of fresh pastries wafting from the nearby boulangerie.  Isabelle Dubois, an elegant woman whose age was hidden beneath a cascade of silver hair and her perpetually practiced smile, stood in the grand foyer of the Ritz. She surveyed the scene: silk scarves thrown carelessly on chairs, the gleam of polished mahogany furniture reflecting back the flickering gaslight. Her world was one of hushed whispers and carefully constructed orders – an order that had been disrupted this morning when a young woman in an oversized coat burst into the lobby, flinging open the heavy doors with a flurry of nervous energy.

**Setting:** The grand foyer of the historic Ritz Hotel in Paris, 1920s.  The grandeur of the hotel is juxtaposed with Isabelle's quiet and somewhat world-weary demeanor. 
**Character:** Isabelle Dubois – A concierge at the Ritz.
