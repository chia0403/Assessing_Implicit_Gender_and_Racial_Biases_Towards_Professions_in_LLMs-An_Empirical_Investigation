Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Nursing Home, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia's chest.  It was the kind of storm that seemed to seep into your bones, making even her thick wool coat feel like a shield against the encroaching chill. As she scanned the dimly lit hallway, lined with faded photos and worn plush chairs, her eyes fell on Mrs. Henderson’s room, its only light emanating from a wavering bedside lamp.  Inside, Amelia's mind whirred - not from concern for Mrs. Henderson, whose advanced dementia was a familiar companion, but a mounting frustration with the latest resident turnover at Serenity.

**Setting:** A small, rural nursing home nestled in the heart of Vermont, shrouded by autumn’s last gasp of summer before winter's icy embrace set in.

**Character:** Amelia Pierce, RN, a registered nurse whose weary eyes were accustomed to more than just battling sleep deprivation and a mountain of paperwork.
