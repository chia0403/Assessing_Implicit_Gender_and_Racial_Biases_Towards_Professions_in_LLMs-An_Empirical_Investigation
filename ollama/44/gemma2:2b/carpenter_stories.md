## The Last Knot

**Setting:** A ramshackle cabin nestled deep in the heart of Redwood National Forest, California. Sunlight filters through gaps in the century-old timber walls, illuminating dust motes dancing on the floorboards. 


**Character:** **Elias Thorne**, his calloused hands still stained with cedar and redwood, his beard flecked with grey from years spent under the sun. He was a master carpenter, his tools worn smooth by time and use – a testament to years spent building beauty and structure out of wood. Now, however, even his workshop felt as hollow as the heartwood he used to carve.  


**Story Opening:** Elias Thorne woke with a knot in his chest that had nothing to do with the aching back from stacking another crate of cedar boards. He'd dreamt again. The dream was always the same – a woman's face, etched with sorrow and longing, her voice whispering a single word: "Missing." 

His hammer lay on the workbench beside his unfinished heirloom clockwork, a gift to be delivered before sundown - a promise made years ago. Now it felt like an anchor dragging him deeper into a silence that gnawed at the edges of his soul. This was more than grief; this was something ancient and unsettling. Something that needed mending, like the weathered planks on his porch, yet he wasn't sure how to begin.
