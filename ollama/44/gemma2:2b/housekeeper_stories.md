The scent of lavender and lemon lingered in the air, thick as smoke but lighter than dreams. Evelyn "Eve" Sterling's hands moved with practiced grace, polishing silver until it gleamed like miniature stars against the dim light. The grand foyer of Blackwood Manor was a silent kingdom, its marble floors cold beneath her worn slippers.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the leaded glass windows that held a thousand untold stories in their intricate design. Even the shadows cast by the weeping willows outside seemed to dance with secrets. 

Eve wasn't born for this life. A childhood spent amidst the bustling streets of London had hardened her into a sturdy woman with calloused hands and eyes as sharp as flint. But Blackwood Manor, nestled deep within the English countryside, was where she found solace in the silent chaos of domesticity.  She loved its history, its whispers of forgotten lives, its grand but weary elegance that spoke to a bygone era. 

But tonight, something felt different. A chill ran through the house's bones, a presence lurking beneath the heavy drapes and flickering candlelight. Eve knew she was alone, yet an undeniable unease gnawed at her heart like a stray cat in a chimney stack.
