The neon "For Sale" sign buzzed like a frantic bee trapped in a jar, casting its sickly yellow light across the cracked asphalt driveway. Its glare reflected off the dusty windows of the Victorian mansion, which stood like a forgotten monarch shrouded in an emerald-green shroud. This was the house that had haunted Amelia Thorne's dreams since childhood, a shadow clinging to her every waking moment since she started her real estate career in this very town.

Amelia Thorne wasnâ€™t just any agent; she carried within her the weight of generations of whispers about the house. Her grandmother, the last owner of a sprawling estate that had succumbed to time and neglect before Amelia was born, had left behind an old journal detailing its tragic history. The mansion, she discovered in her research, was said to be haunted by the ghost of Elizabeth Hawthorne, a wealthy socialite who had met her untimely demise within its walls decades ago. 

Amelia sighed, pulling off her worn leather jacket. "Ready for another round, Mrs. Peterson?"  She addressed the woman standing before her, her eyes wide with an unnerving mixture of fear and hope.  The storm brewing outside seemed to mirror the chaos swirling inside Amelia's head. The prospect of facing the house and its secrets was daunting, but there was something about this woman's desperation that compelled Amelia to take a chance.
