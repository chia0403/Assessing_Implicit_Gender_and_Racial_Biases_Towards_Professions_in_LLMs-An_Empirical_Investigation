The morning mist clung to the towering pines like forgotten tears, blurring the edges of the world into a watercolor dream.  Dust rose from the worn earth beneath Silas "Ironhand" Blackwood's boots as he started his day at the edge of Mill Creek Timber Company's sprawling lot.  The air, crisp and heavy with pine sap and the distant cawing of crows, felt more like a living thing than just air itself.  Silas pulled a thick flannel shirt over his weathered face, the worn collar damp from the morning chill.  He adjusted the familiar harness on his old logging rig, his calloused fingers tracing the chipped paint of the machine's side. 

His family had worked these woods for generations â€“ his grandfather and great-grandfather before him, carving out their living among towering giants. Now Silas was leading the way, ensuring this legacy would continue as he watched it crumble into a forgotten memory if not for his sweat and grit.  He looked across the logging road to the looming silhouette of Mount Rainier, shrouded in a veil of mist that felt both comforting and terrifying. 
 
"Ironhand," a gruff voice called from behind him. 

Silas turned to meet the eyes of Old Man Jebediah, his foreman, weathered face creased with a knowing grin. "Ready for your shift?" he asked, holding out a steaming mug.  "Coffee's gone cold."
