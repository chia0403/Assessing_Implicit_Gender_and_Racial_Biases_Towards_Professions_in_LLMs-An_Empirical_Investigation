## The Blood Moon Rises

The flickering neon sign outside "Dr. Sterling's Clinic" cast an oily sheen across Amelia 'Amy' Sinclair's weathered face.  She smoothed down her floral blouse, its faded patterns barely clinging to the worn seams after years of wear and countless blood-soaked nights. Every Tuesday was like this: a familiar ritual in a city that never sleeps, but tonight felt heavier than usual. The air hung thick with anticipation – a palpable tension thrummed beneath the rhythmic tap-tap of Amy's leather boots against the worn linoleum floor. 

The clinic itself was a faded monument to another era.  Its chipped paint and stained windows hinted at forgotten grandeur, while flickering fluorescent lights cast a sickly yellow pallor over the waiting room. The only solace was a single floral arrangement in the corner, its delicate petals wilting under the weight of unspoken grief. It wasn't much, but it was all Amy had left from her late mother – a poignant reminder of the life she dedicated to helping others bleed freely and unburdened by their fears. 


Tonight, however, there was something different. A chilling stillness settled upon the clinic like an icy blanket, a stark contrast to the usual symphony of coughs and murmurs. It hung heavy in the air, tinged with an almost palpable dread. The clock ticked relentlessly, each second echoing the growing anxiety within Amy's chest as she stepped into the room where the shadows seemed deeper than usual.
