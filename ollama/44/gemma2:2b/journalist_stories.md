## Story Opening: The Undercity

**Setting:** A grimy alleyway in the heart of New Albion's underbelly, known as The Scrapyard. Rain lashed down, slicking the corrugated metal walls and overflowing from gutters, creating a symphony of dripping noise against the howling wind.  A lone neon sign flickered above the entrance to "The Rusty Dragon," casting an eerie green glow on the surrounding gloom. 

**Character:** Evelyn Vance, known in journalistic circles as “Eve V.” A hardened reporter with weary eyes and a camera always slung across her shoulder, Eve had spent years chasing down stories no one else dared touch. Tonight, she was hunting for whispers of a legend – The Whispering Man, rumored to be the only person who could communicate with the ghosts trapped in New Albion's crumbling undercity. 

**Opening Lines:**  "They say he speaks to the dead," Eve muttered, her voice barely audible above the din of the alley. "But I’m a journalist, not a psychic." She adjusted her fedora, shielding her face from the dampness and stared through the grimy window into the dimly lit bar. A single figure sat by himself in a corner booth, seemingly invisible against the flickering neon glow.  He wasn't human; his form was fluid, almost ethereal, yet there was an air of stillness about him – an emptiness that matched the bleakness of the city itself. Eve took a deep breath and slowly pushed open the door. "Mr. Whispering Man?" 

**Possible Questions:** What does Eve want from The Whispering Man? How will she approach this unconventional story?  What is the cost of venturing into the city's underbelly, and what dangers await her?
