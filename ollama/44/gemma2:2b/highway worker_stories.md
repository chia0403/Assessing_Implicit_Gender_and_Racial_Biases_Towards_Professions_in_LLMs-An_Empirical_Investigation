The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Daniel "Danny" Callahan like an unwelcome second skin.  He wiped his brow, the bandana on his forehead already damp with sweat, as he surveyed the mess before him. A six-lane stretch of Interstate 80 had seen better days. The asphalt shimmered under the unrelenting August sun, cracked and crumbling in places, a testament to years of relentless traffic. Around him, other workers bustled about - their orange vests a sea of motion against the stark backdrop of faded concrete and steel – but Danny stood alone.  

He held his trusty shovel close, the familiar weight a comforting presence in the stifling heat. 5:00 AM was prime time for road work on this stretch of highway, before the early morning rush turned into a roaring torrent of vehicles. The air hummed with an almost palpable energy - anticipation, maybe? – as the workers braced themselves for the day's task. Danny felt it too, a knot forming in his stomach, mirroring the unease he couldn’t quite shake off. It was just… different this morning. 


**Setting:** 

A deserted stretch of Interstate 80, nestled within the vast plains of Nebraska. The highway is known for its desolate beauty and frequent encounters with wildlife.
