The late November air hung thick with anticipation, tinged with the metallic tang of rain just beginning to fall on the already grey sky.  Inside the grand old library of Oakhaven University, the usual hushed reverence was being replaced by a restless murmur and hurried whispers. It was opening night for the annual "Tales from the Stacks" event, where students could wander through the labyrinthine shelves, listening to readings by faculty members. 

Elias Thorne, known affectionately as "Eli" amongst his colleagues, shuffled across the polished marble floor of the library's grand hall. He wasn’t a stranger to these hushed spaces, but tonight felt different - electric with anticipation, and the air crackled with something more than the usual quiet murmur. Tonight, he had a secret – one that, like the dusty tomes lining the shelves, held untold possibilities. 

Eli adjusted his worn janitor's cap over his unruly brown hair and sighed.  He was used to the silence, the comforting weight of routine. But tonight, Eli felt an unexpected pull toward something beyond the mundane, something whispered at the edges of his consciousness. He just needed someone to listen – and maybe, just maybe, help him find the words.
