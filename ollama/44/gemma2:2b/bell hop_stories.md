The crisp air of late September bit at Elias Thorne's exposed skin as he hauled another suitcase up the grand, curved staircase. The Gilded Age splendor of the Ambassador Hotel shimmered in the fading afternoon light, its brass railings glinting like a million fallen stars.  He navigated the labyrinthine halls with practiced ease, his worn leather gloves gripping the worn edges of each suitcase with a comforting familiarity. Elias was the last bellhop on duty for the night – an almost solitary guardian to a thousand secrets and stories locked away within the towering walls. The city's roar awaited him outside, but tonight, he preferred the hushed symphony of the hotel – every creak of a floorboard, every groan of a rusty door handle, whispered tales of lives lived in this opulent oasis.

His name was Elias Thorne, and for years now, he had walked these halls like a ghost, his life intertwined with the ebb and flow of those who came and went. Tonight, however, something felt different. An undercurrent of unease pulsed within him, a feeling that couldn't be explained by the usual late-night jitters or the lingering scent of stale champagne from last night's gala. 

As Elias reached the final suite on his list – a sprawling penthouse apartment perched high above the city - he glanced at the worn brass plaque attached to its door. Room 34B, it read in stark black letters, and a shiver ran down his spine. For some reason, he felt compelled to unlock it, his heart beating a frantic rhythm against his ribs. This room, this was where the mystery lay hidden. And tonight, Elias Thorne wasn't just a bellhop; he was about to step into the center of it all.
