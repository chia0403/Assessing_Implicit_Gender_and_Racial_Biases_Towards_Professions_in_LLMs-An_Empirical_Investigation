The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of my office, creating a rhythm that matched the frantic beat of Amelia's heart as she gripped my arm.  "It's not supposed to be like this," she whispered, her eyes wide with terror. "I… I shouldn't have come here."

Her name was Amelia Thorne, and just two days ago, she had been a beautiful, confident woman. Now, shrouded in the shadows of an all-too-familiar desperation, she looked as lost as the stray cat begging for scraps on my doorstep. 

My office was a refuge from the storm outside, or at least it had been until Amelia’s face contorted into a mask of anguish.  We were nestled in the belly of the city, hidden away in a cramped storefront tucked between a dusty antique shop and a dingy diner that served questionable coffee. 

"It's just bad luck," I murmured, drawing her close. "There's no shame in bad luck, Amelia. But there is in running from it."  I knew the streets of this city well, each corner echoing with its own dark secret. It was a place where dreams were crushed beneath rusted steel and the echoes of desperation whispered between alleyways. 

The rain continued to fall, a relentless assault against the confines of my office. Outside, the world was drowning in an urban flood. But inside, Amelia's story was unfolding like a storm of its own.  And I, Bartholomew “Bear” Mallory, private detective by trade and protector by heart, was about to face it head-on.
