## The Whispering Walls 

**Setting:** A ramshackle clinic nestled in the heart of the coastal city of Saltwind. It sits precariously on the edge of an old port district known for its crumbling docks and whispering stories of forgotten fortunes and darker secrets. The air is thick with salt, the tang of fish drying against the backdrop of a relentless sea breeze. 

**Character:** Dr. Eleanor Vance, her name etched in stone as much as she carved into the very fabric of life within Saltwind's unforgiving borders. Her eyes, once sparkling like storm clouds reflecting the city’s tempestuous nature, now carried the weary weight of years spent tending to the city's forgotten corners. 

Eleanor stared at the overflowing waiting room.  The air hung heavy with a miasma of anxieties and unspoken fears; it was the kind of atmosphere that clung to her like a second skin, a constant reminder of the fragile line between hope and despair etched into each patient’s face. The clinic was more than just a place of healing - it was a portal to the city's soul, a reflection of its grit and its grace in equal measure. 

Tonight, however, the whispers were different.  A chilling wind swept through the cracked windowpane, rustling the worn fabric of her coat as it tugged at her mind, pulling her into an unwelcome darkness that seemed to pulsate with the rhythm of the crashing waves. The clinic's very walls seemed to breathe in the evening air, echoing a growing sense of unease that whispered of secrets long buried and whispers of something profoundly sinister lurking beneath Saltwind’s weathered charm.
