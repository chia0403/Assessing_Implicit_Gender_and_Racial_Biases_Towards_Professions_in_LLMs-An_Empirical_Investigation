The sun dipped behind the endless ribbon of asphalt, bleeding orange into a bruised purple sky as Clayton "Steady" Thompson shifted his rig’s weight onto the cracked concrete shoulder. He'd hauled countless loads across these desolate plains for nearly two decades – each one etching another line on his weathered face and deepening the grooves in his soul. The engine hummed, an exhausted lullaby against the growing chill of a coming storm. 

Clayton sat on his truck’s worn leather seat, fiddling with the faded "Lucky Dog" patch sewn onto the dashboard. A familiar ache throbbed in his jaw – a dull reminder of last week's fender bender and a relentless yearning for something more than the endless miles and monotonous routines that defined his life.  The rumble of thunder broke across the flatlands, promising rain and whispers of another storm brewing on the horizon, mirroring the unease gnawing at Clayton's heart. He knew he needed to find something – a spark, perhaps – before the storm swallowed him whole.
