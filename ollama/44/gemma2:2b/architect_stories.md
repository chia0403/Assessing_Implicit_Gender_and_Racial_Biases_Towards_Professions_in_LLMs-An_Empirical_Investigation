The city outside was a blur of gray and neon, each streetlamp struggling to illuminate the swirling storm clouds overhead. 

Amelia was known for taking on projects no one else dared touch - repurposing dilapidated Victorian tenements into thriving artist hubs or transforming run-down railway arches into cozy cafes. This time, though, something felt different.  This wasn’t just another commission; it felt personal.

Now, it felt like an impossible dream, a blueprint for something she could never have imagined. But as Amelia stared out at the storm raging outside, she knew one thing:  this was where her father's unfinished masterpiece was meant to be.
