The sunrise bled through the grime-caked windshield of the Komatsu 790, painting everything in hues of burnt orange and pale gold.  Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood Jr., known to everyone as just Bart, was already awake.  He wouldn't have it any other way – the early hours were his sanctuary, a time for contemplation before the cacophony of heavy machinery started to shake the earth. 

The mountain air was crisp, biting at exposed skin and laced with the scent of pine needles and wet earth. The steel-gray shadow of Mount Diablo loomed in the distance, its peak shrouded by a veil of morning fog. A symphony of creaks and groans echoed from the construction site – a stark contrast to the serene serenity Bart usually found at work. This was no ordinary mountainside; this was Devil's Backbone Construction, where every day felt like a battle against both the unforgiving terrain and the demanding pressure of deadlines.  

Bart sighed as he adjusted his trucker cap. Another day, another pile of earth destined for oblivion, but even in the chaos, there was beauty. There always was.
