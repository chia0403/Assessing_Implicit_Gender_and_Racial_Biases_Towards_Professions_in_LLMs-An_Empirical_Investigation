The air in Serenity Spa smelled like lavender and eucalyptus, a gentle balm to the city's constant hum.  Sunlight streamed through the frosted glass doors, illuminating the calm haven where Fiona Blackwood was at work. Fiona had been kneading stress into knots for the past decade, her hands, strong and sure, a symphony of pressure and release. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. A tremor in the air, a sudden flurry of activity beyond the usual quiet hum. A client, dressed in charcoal gray with an expression that could curdle milk, sat across from her on the plush massage table. The man's name was Julian Pierce, and Fiona had never seen him before. He didn't move like his reflection â€“ he moved like a storm cloud about to unleash its fury.

The scent of rain hung heavy in the air, mirroring the tension gripping Fiona's shoulders as she began to work. She knew this wasn't a typical massage session.
