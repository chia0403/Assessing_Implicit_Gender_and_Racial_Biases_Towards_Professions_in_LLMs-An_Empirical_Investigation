Rain hammered against the corrugated steel of the shed, each drop echoing like tiny explosions against the tin roof. Inside, Finn "Hammer" O'Connell hunched over his workbench, the familiar scent of sawdust and pine clinging to him like an unwelcome guest. He shifted, the worn leather of his work gloves damp with a mix of sweat and rain, and let out a long sigh. It wasn’t just the weather; it was the weight of expectations, the constant pressure to keep the roof over everyone's head – literally. 

Finn had inherited the family business from his father, who died last summer. The legacy felt heavier than the lead-laden shingles he dealt with daily. He glanced at the calendar hanging by a nail on the wall; it was already September, and that meant another round of fall roof repairs for the town's stubborn, weather-beaten residents. 

The small town of Oakhaven, nestled between the rugged foothills and the ever-present mist-laden coast, felt like a canvas painted in shades of grey. Its charm lay in its simplicity, but sometimes even simple things held hidden burdens. Finn had always seen that burden, felt it as he climbed up to the dizzy heights of a roof, every gust of wind threatening to rip him from his precarious perch. 

His gaze fell upon the faded photo tucked into his toolbox. A young girl with bright eyes and hair like sunshine beamed back at him, her smile almost tangible in its warmth. It was Amelia, his sister's child.
