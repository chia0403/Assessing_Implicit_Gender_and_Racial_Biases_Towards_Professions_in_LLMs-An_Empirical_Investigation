Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Alistair Blackwood's office, each drop echoing like a tiny heartbeat in the otherwise silent room.  The muted thrum of the city below was almost swallowed by the roaring wind and swirling mist that clawed at the glass facade. Inside, Dr. Blackwood hunched over his worn leather desk, a cup of steaming black coffee clutched between his numb fingers. He had spent the last four hours staring blankly into the flickering reflection of the interrogation room's security camera feed –  the face of the suspect, Edward Thorne, a man whose eyes held not remorse, but an unsettling calm that seemed to seep through the screen and into Alistair's soul. 

Alistair was one of the few forensic psychologists entrusted with working on cases as intricate and volatile as this: the case of the "Night Stalker," who had been terrorizing the city for weeks with a series of seemingly orchestrated murders, each victim chosen from a carefully curated list of individuals with unique psychological profiles and backgrounds. The only link between the victims was their connection to the city's vibrant art scene - each one a patron or curator of an avant-garde gallery, a hauntingly artistic echo that Alistair felt seeping into his thoughts like the rain outside.  He couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn’t simply about power or greed, but something deeper – a twisted reflection of the artist's own subconscious, something hidden beneath layers of societal masks and carefully crafted personas.
