The late afternoon sun, slanting through the stained-glass windows of St. Anne's Rehabilitation Center, cast long, dancing shadows on the worn linoleum floor. Inside one of the therapy rooms, the air hung thick with anticipation and a hint of lavender â€“ Dr. Esme Thorne's signature calming blend of essential oils.  Esme adjusted the straps of her green cardigan as she surveyed the room, her gaze lingering on the young woman lying on the exam table, her face etched with anxiety. 

This was Clara, a budding artist whose dreams were being slowly eroded by the after-effects of a debilitating stroke that had left her paralyzed on one side and struggling to regain control of her hand movements. Esme took a deep breath, knowing the task before her was no simple rehab exercise. Today, Clara wasn't just about regaining physical skills; she needed to reclaim her artistic soul, which seemed to be fading with each passing moment. 
 
The room held promise.  An easel stood against the wall, covered in paint-splattered canvas, a vibrant palette of colors waiting for its creative expression. Esme had planned a three-week program designed to reawaken Clara's artistic spirit through gentle exercises and guided imagery, all while encouraging her imagination and restoring her sense of self-efficacy. 
  
"Ready to start?" Esme asked softly, her voice carrying a calming timbre that was as soothing as the lavender aroma swirling in the room.
