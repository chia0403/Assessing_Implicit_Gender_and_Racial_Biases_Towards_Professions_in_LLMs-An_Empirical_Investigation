Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Hayes' office, mimicking the churning in her stomach. The scent of cinnamon candles, meant to be calming, did little to soothe the anxiety that coiled tight in her chest. Across from her sat Amelia Jones, a woman whose face was etched with worry lines deeper than any she'd seen on a child's hand. 

Eleanor gazed across the worn wooden desk where the client nervously fidgeted. She knew Amelia’s story; it was the kind that haunted her nights, whispering doubts and fears into the quiet corners of her mind. The whispers echoed again in the storm outside: "They don’t understand," they hissed. "You’ll never be good enough."

Amelia's voice, barely a tremor, broke the silence.  "Dr. Hayes..." she started, then stopped, gathering herself before she continued. "My husband… he said I need to see a therapist. He's... scared." 

The words hung in the air like smoke, thick and suffocating. This wasn’t just another case; it was about her own past, about how she had failed to protect those who needed her most, how she had let fear and resentment fester until they bled through into everything she did. Eleanor took a deep breath, ready for the battle that lay ahead – not only for Amelia's soul but for her own in trying to reconcile with the legacy of silence. 

**Setting:**  The storm-tossed town of Oakhaven, nestled amidst rolling hills and shrouded in an ever-present mist. The small, antique-filled counseling center was housed in a cozy cottage that felt both welcoming and deeply isolated.
