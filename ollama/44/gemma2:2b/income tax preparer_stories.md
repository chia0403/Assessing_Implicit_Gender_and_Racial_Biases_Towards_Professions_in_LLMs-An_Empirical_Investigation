The air in Amelia “Amy” Miller's tiny office smelled faintly of stale coffee and despair. It was a Tuesday in late January, 2023, and the snow-dusted windows cast an icy gloom across the worn linoleum floor. Amy watched another year dissolve into the tax season abyss, her weary eyes glued to the mountain of pre-filled forms that seemed to grow taller with each passing day. She had a reputation for being "the miracle worker," but this year felt different.  The financial woes felt more personal, more palpable, as if they were bleeding through to the cracks in Amy's carefully constructed facade of professional detachment. The weight of it all was heavy on her shoulders, making her long for an escape – maybe a hot bath and some freshly baked cookies, or perhaps, a brief flight to Hawaii, a far-off place where tax returns never mattered. But that was just another illusion, she thought, as the familiar pang of duty tugged at her soul. 


**Setting:**  A small, independent tax preparation office tucked away in a quiet residential neighborhood on the outskirts of Chicago. The office itself is a space defined by practicality and clutter – an old oak desk with stacks of tax forms overflowing from one corner, a worn-down couch nestled against a brick wall, and filing cabinets that groan under their own weight. 


**Main Character:** Amy Miller
