The humid August air clung to Ms. Amelia Croft like a second skin as she stood at her classroom door. The smell of freshly cut grass from the neighboring park mingled with the faint aroma of old textbooks and lingering coffee – an unsettling combination that had become as much a part of Mrs. Croft’s daily routine as her tweed jacket and sensible shoes.  The year was 1986, and for Ms. Croft, teaching at the bustling Westview High was not just a job; it was a tapestry woven with years of student encounters, countless late nights grading essays, and the bittersweet ache of watching students grow from awkward teenagers into hopeful adults.

Today's air, thick with anticipation, promised to be different. It wasn’t just the first day of senior year.  Something felt…off. Ms. Croft adjusted her glasses, a familiar feeling of unease creeping up her spine. This was an unsettling time for Westview; whispers of unexplained absences, hushed phone calls about “an incident” in the school library, and rumors of an unknown student who had mysteriously vanished after a late-night study session.  Ms. Croft had spent years navigating the complexities of high school life, but this felt like something beyond the usual teenage drama – this felt ominous. 

With a deep breath, Ms. Croft pushed open the door to her classroom and looked out at the sea of faces that seemed to blur into a single image. They were all there – students with wide eyes, nervous smiles, and whispers in between notes - ready for another year in the seemingly infinite labyrinth of high school life.
