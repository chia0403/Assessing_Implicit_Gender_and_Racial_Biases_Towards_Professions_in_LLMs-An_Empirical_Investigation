The air hung heavy with the scent of vanilla and rising bread in Clara Bellefleur's bakery. The aroma was a comforting blanket against the chill of the October morning, but tonight, it carried an undercurrent of unease that lingered like a stray crumb on the counter.  Clara, her hands dusted with flour, stared out the window at the storm brewing beyond the old town walls of Oakhaven. It was supposed to be the night of the annual Harvest Moon Festival, the culmination of all their hard work in celebrating the bountiful harvest they'd reaped that summer. But now, a knot of worry tightened her chest as she watched the sky darken and the wind pick up, whipping rain against the shop window like frantic fingers clawing at the glass.  

She was known throughout Oakhaven for her delectable pies, each bite bursting with flavor and texture. Every year, she baked for the festival, filling the small town square with warmth and a symphony of sweet scents as she sold her legendary apple pies by day. But tonight, an unsettling feeling crept in; it wasn't just the storm raging outside, but a sense of something deeply wrong, something that felt like the wind itself was whispering secrets she didn't quite understand.
