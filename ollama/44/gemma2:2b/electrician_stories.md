Rain lashed against the grimy window of **Elias Thorne's** workshop, each drop like a tiny fist pummelling the glass. The air inside was thick with grease and the smell of ozone, punctuated by the rhythmic whirring of his tools. Elias, all lean muscle and wiry patience, squinted at the panel on the busted-down boiler in the corner, its metal skin stained with rust. It wasn't just a job, not tonight.  The old man across the street had lost power hours ago, leaving him to fend off the creeping chill of the storm and the gnawing worry that throbbed in his chest like an erratic heartbeat.

Elias knew this kind of trouble all too well. Every time the sky turned from azure to charcoal, a surge of tension would coil around him, tightening until it felt like he was about to pop. But tonight was different. Tonight felt raw and dangerous, the wind carrying whispers on its fury that hinted at something larger than just a faulty boiler. The storm wasn't just weather; it was a warning, a call to action.  Tonight, Elias Thorne would answer.
