The salt-laced wind whipped Elara's cloak around her legs as she stood on the precipice overlooking the bustling port of Veridian. The crimson glow of the setting sun painted the weathered stone walls of the Citadel in shades of fire and blood, its rhythmic pulse echoing through the cobbled streets below. Her duty was clear: to protect this gateway between two worlds - a task that weighed heavier than the chains she wore around her waist. Elara was the last of the Sentinels, the only one who remembered the ancient ways, the forgotten art of navigating the Veil – the shimmering divide where reality shifted and shadows danced. 

Tonight, however, a tension thrummed beneath the jovial hum of trade. Whispers carried on the wind, spoken in hushed tones that spoke of unrest in the Eastern Kingdoms. The rumors claimed they were building an army, fueled by desperation and fear. Tonight, Veridian would be host to a new shipment of goods – precious cargo, bound for the King's Palace.  And Elara knew something was amiss. This wasn’t just about the delivery; it was about the echoes of whispers she could almost hear - a silent promise of something much more sinister than trade.
