Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of "Grease Monkey" Garage like tiny fists pounding on a tired old heart.  The air inside was thick with the scent of motor oil and burnt rubber – a familiar comfort to Ethan Blackwood, his shop's owner and sole mechanic since he’d turned 16.  He’d spent more time under the hood than in most people's kitchens, learning from his grandfather, who had taught him that every engine held a story and every repair was an act of love for the machine.

Tonight was different. Ethan was hunched over a sputtering Ford pickup, trying to coax life back into its worn-down heart.  The owner, a gruff man named Clyde whose demeanor matched his truck's rusty paint job, had been a storm cloud ever since he'd brought in the beast for repair.  Ethan didn’t know why – something about the way Clyde’s eyes narrowed with suspicion when Ethan started to talk about the engine’s “soul”, something about his tight-lipped silence that felt strangely accusing. 

A lone, flickering streetlight outside cast long shadows across the garage floor, making Ethan's hands tremble as he tightened a bolt.  The storm raged on, and the air held an almost palpable tension as if even the wind itself had begun to whisper secrets about Clyde’s hidden anxieties.  Ethan felt it too, a strange unease that prickled at the back of his neck. Something was amiss. Tonight's repair wasn't just about fixing a truck; it was about uncovering a story that threatened to unravel everything Ethan thought he knew about Clyde and the world around him.
