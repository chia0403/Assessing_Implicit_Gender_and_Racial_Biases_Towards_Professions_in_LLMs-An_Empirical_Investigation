The fluorescent hum of the convenience store was almost deafening as Estelle adjusted her "Help Wanted" badge. It felt heavy on her chest, heavier than usual tonight. The late hour brought a strange stillness to the aisles, the only sounds the rustling of plastic bags and the distant whirring of a nearby vending machine.  It was this quiet that made the tension in her shoulders tighten with each passing minute.  

Estelle's name was etched onto a little card attached to the badge - just another face in a sea of strangers, each one a fleeting fragment in the vast tapestry of life. But tonight, she wasn't just filling bags or counting coins; she was facing something bigger, more unsettling than usual: a feeling that there was an unseen presence lurking within the shadows cast by the fluorescent lights. 
 
**Setting:**  A lonely corner convenience store on a quiet suburban street in the middle of the night.
