The steel beam groaned beneath Daniel “Danny” O’Reilly as he tightened the bolts with his trusty wrench.  It was just another Tuesday in Phoenix, the sun beating down on the concrete jungle that was the city's newest apartment complex. The air hung thick and hazy, punctuated by the rhythmic thrum of construction machinery. The 90-degree desert heat shimmered off the scaffolding, turning everything into a distorted mirage.  Danny leaned back against the rough wood support beam, letting out a tired sigh. It was more than just the heat; there was an underlying tension in the air today, a sense of something brewing, waiting to erupt. 

The construction site hummed with activity - the sound of concrete being poured, a pile driver's rhythmic hammer blow echoing through the morning air, and the sharp chatter of workers discussing their day as they worked. Danny could feel it - an unwelcome anxiety clinging to the edges of his consciousness.  He knew this was just another Tuesday. But something felt different today, like the ground beneath him had shifted a fraction. He glanced nervously at the construction manager's office, where a man with a grim expression sat behind a dusty desk. 

"Danny?" The manager's voice, sharp as a blade, snapped Danny back to reality. "You finished the bolt?" 
 
Danny nodded, his fingers still gripping the wrench.  He was used to it. Used to the boss’s questions. But this time, he just wanted a break from the tension and the heat.
