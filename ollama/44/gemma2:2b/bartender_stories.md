The smoky haze hung thick in the air, clinging to the worn leather booths and chipped marble bar like remnants of forgotten wishes.  Rain lashed against the storefront windowpanes, mirroring the tumultuous tempest brewing inside Elias Thorne’s soul. He poured another round for his regulars – three shots of rye whiskey and a side of melancholy that went down smoother than the amber liquid in his hands. It was late, past midnight, on the cusp of dawn. 

Elias, or "Eli" as everyone called him, was a ghost among men - tall, with coal-black hair pulled back tight and eyes that held the blue glint of forgotten winter skies. He ran “The Copper Kettle” – a dive bar tucked away in the heart of Chicago's notorious Westside – his refuge, his curse, his legacy.  For twenty years, he'd weathered storms of broken promises and shattered dreams, pouring solace into weary souls and keeping secrets hidden behind his gruff demeanor.

Tonight, however, even Eli's usual cynicism couldn’t mask the weight of despair that clung to him like a second skin. A man in the corner booth was staring straight ahead, hunched over with a trembling hand clutching a photograph. Every so often, he would mutter under his breath, "She won't answer."
