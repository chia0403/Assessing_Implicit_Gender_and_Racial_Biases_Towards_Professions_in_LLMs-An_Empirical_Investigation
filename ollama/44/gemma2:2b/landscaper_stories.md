The humid air hung heavy in the sprawling, overgrown yard.  Sunbeams struggled to penetrate the dense canopy of leaves that had reclaimed their once manicured form, turning the afternoon into a perpetually twilight zone. Every surface was veiled with an emerald green that felt more oppressive than inviting. It would’ve been beautiful if you weren't constantly wading through layers of leaves and dodging unseen thorns as you tried to navigate it all.  Especially now, as Liam "Lumpy" Miller struggled under the weight of a colossal oak tree.

Liam, his calloused hands gripping onto its gnarled roots, grimaced as he felt the tree’s ancient wood creak under him. The once-pristine lines of the garden that had been meticulously planned by Mrs. Hawthorne before she passed away now lay scattered and wild, like forgotten children left to play in a forgotten yard.  His trusty spade clattered on the worn earth. Lumpy was used to fighting against the overgrown wilderness, a warrior battling against the forces of nature's neglect.  He just wished he had a bit more than his trusty shovel and a few days worth of back pain for this fight.
