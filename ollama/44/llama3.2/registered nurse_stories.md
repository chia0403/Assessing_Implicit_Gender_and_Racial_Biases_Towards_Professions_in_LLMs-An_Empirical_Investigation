Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of New Orleans,Registered Nurse Alexandra Elizabeth Dubois stirred in her small apartment above the French Quarter bakery where she worked as a night shift nurse. The smell of freshly baked croissants wafted up from below, mingling with the scent of damp earth and decay that clung to the city's ancient stones.

Alexandra rubbed the fatigue from her eyes, feeling the weight of another long day at Mercy Hospital bearing down on her. She had always loved the fast-paced, unpredictable world of nursing, but lately, she'd been struggling to balance her demanding job with the growing sense of unease that seemed to settle in the pit of her stomach like a cold, dark stone.

The sounds of the city outside her window - the jazz drifting from Preservation Hall, the distant hum of a motorcycle revving up on Decatur Street - were a familiar lullaby to Alexandra, one that usually soothed her frazzled nerves. But tonight, something felt off. The air seemed heavier, more oppressive, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching her from just beyond the edge of perception.

With a deep breath, Alexandra swung her legs over the side of the bed and planted her feet firmly on the ground, ready to face whatever lay ahead in the night shift ahead. Little did she know, this would be a night like any other - one that would shake her to her very core, and change her life forever.
