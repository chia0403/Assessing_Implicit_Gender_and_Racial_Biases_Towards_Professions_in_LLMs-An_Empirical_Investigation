Here's a potential story opening and setting:

In the sweltering summer of 1985, Amelia Rose Thompson stepped out of the humid New Orleans air and into the gleaming glass lobby of the historic St. Charles Hotel in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. As a top salesperson for the burgeoning software firm, Synergee Inc., Amelia had spent the better part of the past five years traveling the country, peddling her company's innovative new product to corporate executives and small business owners alike.

With her signature red hair tucked away beneath a sleek black blazer, Amelia flashed a bright smile as she greeted the hotel's concierge with a firm handshake. "Good morning, Monsieur LaFleur," she said, extending her business card for inspection. Her eyes sparkled with confidence as she reviewed her sales targets and notes on the company's latest marketing campaign.

As the St. Charles Hotel buzzed with activity - from the late-night revelers pouring out of the jazz clubs to the early-morning business travelers hastily checking in before heading back to their suites - Amelia felt a thrill of excitement wash over her. This was it, she thought, this was the one: the meeting that would seal Synergee Inc.'s deal with Louisiana's largest insurance firm and catapult her to the top of the sales ranks.

But little did Amelia know, her chance encounter with Monsieur LaFleur's rival - a ruthless businessman with a reputation for crushing his competitors - was about to set off a chain reaction that would challenge everything she thought she knew about her job, her company, and herself.
