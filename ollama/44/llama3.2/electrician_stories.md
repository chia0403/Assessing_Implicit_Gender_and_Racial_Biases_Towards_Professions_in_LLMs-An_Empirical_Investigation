Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the small town of Ravenswood like a cold, grey curtain, shrouding its streets and buildings in a misty gloom that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp blanket. Inside the cramped, dimly lit workshop of his family's electrical contracting business, Jamie Michael Reed hunched over a tangled mess of wires and circuit breakers, his eyes fixed intently on the faulty wiring that had brought the entire system crashing down.

It was 3 AM on a Wednesday, and the only sound outside was the steady patter of raindrops against the shop's corrugated metal roof. The only light came from a flickering fluorescent tube overhead, which cast eerie shadows on the walls as Jamie worked to diagnose the problem. He had been an electrician for over a decade, just like his father before him, and he took pride in being able to fix anything that was broken - but there was something about this particular job that had him stumped.

As he carefully probed the tangled mess with a long-handled plier, Jamie couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The building's owner, Old Man Jenkins, had been acting strangely for days, always getting to his office late at night and whispering on the phone in hushed tones. And now, just as Jamie was starting to get close to a solution, he received a mysterious message scrawled on a scrap of paper that lay abandoned on the workbench: "Don't touch anything".

Jamie's eyes narrowed as he stared at the cryptic note. What did it mean? And who had written it?
