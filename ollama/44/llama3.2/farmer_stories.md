Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and worn buildings. The air was filled with the sweet scent of ripe corn and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum. In a small field just outside of town, Emilia "Mia" Thompson was bringing in the harvest from her family's farm, Greenhaven Acres.

As she walked through the rows of golden wheat, the soft earth beneath her boots releasing the smell of damp soil and decaying leaves, Mia couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and accomplishment. It had been a long day of work, but she had managed to get everything in just in time for the harvest festival that was set to take place later that week.

Mia's family had farmed this land for generations, and she took great care to carry on the tradition. She had learned everything from her father, who had learned it from his father before him. The Thompsons were known throughout the county for their high-quality produce and commitment to sustainable farming practices.

As Mia finished up the last of the harvest and began to make her way back to the farmhouse, she noticed a strange sight in the distance - a sleek black car pulling into the driveway, its occupants watching her with an air of curiosity.
