Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The sun was setting over the small village of Ashwood, casting a warm orange glow over the thatched roofs and the bustling town square. Amidst the hustle and bustle, one figure stood out - Kaelin "Kae" Stonebrook, a skilled stone cutter with hands as rough-hewn as the rocks he worked with.

Kae had lived in Ashwood his entire life, learning the art of stoneworking from his father and grandfather before him. He took pride in his work, crafting intricate patterns and designs into the stone that adorned the village's buildings and monuments. But Kae's latest project was different - a grand monument to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the village's founding, commissioned by the wealthy merchant lord, Marcellus Wychwood.

As the light began to fade, Kae made his way back to his workshop, nestled between two rows of timber-framed houses on the outskirts of town. The air was thick with the smell of damp earth and sweat as he carefully cleaned his tools and prepared for the long day ahead.

The sound of hammering echoed through the village streets, punctuated by the occasional shout or laugh from the villagers gathered in the square. But Kae's mind was already on the monument, his thoughts consumed by the weight of responsibility that came with creating something so grand - and the sense of unease that had been growing inside him all day.

What secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of Ashwood, waiting to be uncovered? And what would Kae's role in the village's history become when he finally finished the monument?
