Here's a potential story opening:

The neon sign creaked in the gentle ocean breeze, casting a gaudy glow over the worn wooden deck of McTavish's Pub. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer and yesterday's cigarettes. Behind the bar, Kieran "Kae" McTavish polished a mug with a white cloth, his eyes scanning the crowded room with a practiced mix of disdain and detachment.

At 25, Kae had already spent five years pouring drinks for the locals in this small coastal town, listening to their secrets and keeping them. He'd seen it all – from the fishermen's early morning victories to the beach bums' late-night regrets. The pub was his domain, and the people were his clients.

As the evening wore on and the bar started to clear out, Kae's gaze lingered on a figure sitting alone at the end of the bar. A young woman with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair sat sipping a whiskey, her eyes fixed on some invisible point beyond the horizon. She was new in town, and Kae could sense it – she was waiting for something, or someone. And he knew that when it happened, his life would change forever.

How do you want me to proceed?
