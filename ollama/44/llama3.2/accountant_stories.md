Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the river, shrouding the small town of Ravenswood in a damp, gray mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp blanket. The streets were empty, save for a lone figure hurrying down Main Street, her feet carrying her towards the old office building where she worked as an accountant.

Her name was Emily Josephine Thompson, and she was a woman who had always been good with numbers, but not so great with people. She preferred the quiet, methodical world of finance to the chaos of human interaction, and was content to spend most of her days poring over spreadsheets and balancing ledgers.

As she pushed open the door to her office building, Emily felt a familiar sense of comfort wash over her. The air inside was stale, but it was hers, and she knew every nook and cranny by heart. She made her way to her desk, a small, cluttered space that was filled with stacks of papers, files, and the usual paraphernalia of an accountant's life.

Just as Emily was settling in for another day of work, her phone rang, shrill and insistent. She hesitated for a moment before answering it, wondering who could be calling at this hour, and what they might want.
