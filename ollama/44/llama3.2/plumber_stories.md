Here's a potential story opening and setting for a mystery novel featuring a plumber as the main character:

The rain poured down on the small town of Ravenswood like a dirty blanket, shrouding its streets and homes in a misty gloom. Inside the cramped, dimly lit basement of 1313 Elm Street, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a gruff but lovable plumber with a penchant for getting into tight spots, hunched over his trusty toolbox, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee.

It was just another typical Wednesday evening in Ravenswood, the kind where the town's residents were too busy dealing with leaky faucets and clogged drains to notice the eerie feeling that something was off. The locals called it "the quiet before the storm," but Hawk knew better. He'd spent years working in this small town, and he could smell trouble brewing on days like this.

As he tightened a stubborn bolt on the old water heater, his mind wandered back to the strange phone call he'd received earlier that day from the local sheriff's department. "Hawk, we got us a problem," the dispatcher had said, her voice tight with urgency. "Your boy, Jimmy Jenkins, gone missin' at the Jones' farm on the outskirts of town. You're the only one who can help us get to him before...whatever it is that took him."

Hawk's gut tightened as he thought about Jimmy, a young kid and good friend of his own son's. He knew he had to act fast, but as he looked around the cramped basement, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The kind of feeling that made you wonder if the rain outside was just a coincidence...or something more.

And so, with a deep breath and a resolve born from years of dealing with pipes and problems in Ravenswood, Hawk Hawkins set out to unravel the mystery of Jimmy Jenkins' disappearance, one pipe at a time.
