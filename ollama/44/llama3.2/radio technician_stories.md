Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and shops. In his small workshop on Elm Street, radio technician Emilia Rose Jenkins carefully tuned her latest repair job, a vintage AM radio found in the local antique shop. The soft hum of the equipment and the faint scent of solder and wire filled the air as she worked, her eyes fixed intently on the intricate circuitry beneath the dusty surface.

Emilia had grown up in Ravenswood, learning the ins and outs of electronics from her father, a retired engineer who'd owned the town's only radio repair shop. After his passing five years ago, Emilia had taken over the business, pouring her heart and soul into keeping the art of radio repair alive in a world that seemed increasingly obsessed with digital technology.

As she worked, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A strange noise had been echoing through the workshop's speakers all day, a low-pitched hum that sounded almost like... a voice? She frowned, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tried to pinpoint the source of the sound. It was then that she noticed a small piece of paper on her workbench, folded into a neat square with a cryptic message scrawled across it: "The signal is coming from within."

Emilia's heart skipped a beat as she read the words, a shiver running down her spine. What did they mean? And who could have written such a mysterious message in her workshop?
