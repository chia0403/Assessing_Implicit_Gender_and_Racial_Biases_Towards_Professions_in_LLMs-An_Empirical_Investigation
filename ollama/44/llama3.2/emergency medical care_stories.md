Here's a potential story opening and setting for a thriller/mystery novel featuring an EMT as the main character:

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, nestled in the rugged cliffs and fog-shrouded coves of California's Big Sur coast. The town is home to a tight-knit community, where everyone knows each other's names and secrets.

**Protagonist:**

Meet Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a 32-year-old Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) with the Ravenswood County Fire Department. Lexi has spent her entire life in Ravenswood, where she grew up playing in the sand and surf alongside her parents, both retired EMTs who taught her the ins and outs of emergency care. After high school, Lexi earned an associate's degree in paramedicine from a nearby college and began working for the fire department full-time.

**Story Opening:**

Lexi was on her 30-minute break at the fire station, sipping coffee and scanning the local news app on her phone when she saw it: a breaking news alert about a body found on the beach near Ravenswood's famous Red Rock Cove. The police were on scene, but so far, no one had identified the victim or explained how they ended up dead.

Lexi's curiosity got the best of her, and she quickly grabbed her keys and headed out to get a closer look at the scene. As an EMT, she'd seen her fair share of traumatic events, but something about this story resonated with her. She pulled into the parking lot, where she was greeted by a swarm of police officers, paramedics, and curious onlookers.

As Lexi pushed through the crowd to get a better view, she noticed that one thing didn't add up: there were no emergency medical services personnel at the scene. The body had been found too late for EMTs like her to make a difference, but the police seemed hesitant to claim jurisdiction over the response.

Lexi's instincts told her something was off. She began to wonder if this was more than just a random beach death â€“ and whether she might be about to uncover a dark secret in her own small town.
