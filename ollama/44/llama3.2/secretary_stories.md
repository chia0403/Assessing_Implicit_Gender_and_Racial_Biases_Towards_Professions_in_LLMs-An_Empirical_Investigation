Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished stone as Emily Victoria Jenkins stepped out of the drizzly evening and into the warm, if somewhat musty, atmosphere of her office building. It was 4:47 PM on a typical Wednesday, with only an hour left until the workday drew to a close.

Emily, a petite woman in her mid-twenties with curly brown hair and a smattering of freckles across her cheeks, made her way down the long corridor that led to her office. She had spent the past five years working as a secretary at GreenTech Inc., a small but successful environmental consulting firm, and had grown accustomed to the hum of fluorescent lights overhead and the smell of stale coffee wafting from the break room.

As she entered her office, Emily's gaze fell upon the familiar landscape of neatly organized files, tidy desk drawers, and the large glass window that allowed in a sliver of afternoon sunlight. The view was dominated by the skeletal outline of the Space Needle, its art deco spire reaching towards the grey sky like a shard of splintered steel.

Tonight, however, Emily's thoughts were not on her workday routine or the prospect of leaving behind the fluorescent glow for a night at home with a good book. Tonight, she was consumed by a sense of unease that had been growing in the pit of her stomach all day – an uneasy feeling that something was off, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was.

As she made her way to the water cooler to grab a final sip before locking up for the night, Emily's hand hesitated over the cool glass surface. The silence outside seemed oppressive, and the shadows cast by the flickering fluorescent lights appeared to twist into sinister shapes on the walls.

Suddenly, Emily felt a shiver run down her spine. It was as if she knew that something was waiting just beyond the edge of her perception – something that would change everything.
