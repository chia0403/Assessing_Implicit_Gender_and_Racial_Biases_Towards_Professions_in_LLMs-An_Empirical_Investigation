Here's a potential story opening:

As she stepped out of her small apartment and onto the crisp morning air of Manhattan, Emilia Rose Thompson couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over her. The city was always alive, but on this particular Tuesday morning, it felt like a different beast altogether. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool breeze fill her lungs as she gazed out at the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever.

Emilia, a talented interior decorator with a keen eye for design and a passion for creating unique spaces, had just received an unexpected phone call from an old client who needed her expertise for a high-stakes project. The call had come in at 6:00 AM, when Emilia was still sipping coffee and checking her emails before starting the day's work. Now, as she stood on the sidewalk, Emilia felt a thrill of excitement mixed with a dash of trepidation. What was this project, and what would it take out of her?

The phone call had been brief, but its words had lingered in Emilia's mind like a whispered secret: "Meet me at the Plaza Hotel at 10:00 AM. We need to talk about the penthouse suite."
