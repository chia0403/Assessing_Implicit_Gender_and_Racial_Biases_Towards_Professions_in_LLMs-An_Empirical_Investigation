Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The mist-shrouded streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving during the night shift. It was 2:47 AM on a drizzly autumn evening when Guard Elijah Everett Harris arrived at the crumbling city walls that marked the entrance to Ravenswood's ancient district. His worn leather boots made barely a sound as he moved along the wet stone, his gaze scanning the shadows for any sign of movement.

As a member of the Ravenswood City Watch, Elijah had been stationed here for nigh on five years, ever vigilant and always on the lookout for anything out of place. The city's residents knew him well enough to nod in passing or offer a gruff greeting, but few really paid attention to the quiet, brooding guard who seemed to be perpetually lost in thought.

Elijah's mind, however, was far from his duties that night. His thoughts were consumed by an unsettling feeling of unease, one that had been growing in intensity for days and refused to be shaken off. It started with small things – a misplaced coin here, a forgotten bundle of sticks there – but had escalated to full-blown panic attacks the previous evening.

Now, as he stood watch on the city wall, Elijah couldn't shake the feeling that something was coming, something big and something bad. The wind howled through the streets like a chorus of restless spirits, casting eerie shadows on the walls below. It was as if Ravenswood itself was holding its breath, waiting for... what? Elijah's instincts screamed at him to be prepared, but his rational mind told him that there had to be some logical explanation for this growing sense of dread.

Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, that unseen eyes were trained on him from the darkness. He checked the lanterns along the wall, casting flickering shadows across the wet cobblestones below. The city was dark and quiet, but Elijah's gut told him otherwise. And when you're a guard in Ravenswood, your intuition is usually right.
