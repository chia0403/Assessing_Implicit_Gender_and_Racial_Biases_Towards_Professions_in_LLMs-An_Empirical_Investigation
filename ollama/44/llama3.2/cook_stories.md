The sun had just begun to set over the bustling streets of Marrakech, casting a warm orange glow over the vibrant souks and markets that filled the ancient city. Amidst the chaos, a small, family-owned restaurant stood out - "Le Coeur de l'Amour," or "The Heart of Love," where Chef and owner Fatima El Khroubi was busy prepping for the evening's service.

Fatima couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, and as she glanced out at the crowded streets of Marrakech, she felt a sense of unease wash over her.
