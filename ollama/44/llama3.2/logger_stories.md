Here's a potential story opening:

The mist-shrouded dawn broke over the small town of Raven's Peak, casting a damp gloom over the weathered logs that lay scattered along the riverbanks. Kaidën Everett, a rugged and seasoned logger with a wild tangle of curly brown hair and a bushy beard to match, emerged from his cabin, stretching his tall frame like a bear shaking off its winter slumber. The scent of freshly cut wood and damp earth filled his nostrils as he took a deep breath, feeling the familiar pulse of the forest beneath his feet.

Kaidën lived on the outskirts of Raven's Peak, where the logging roads ended and the dense timber of the Blackwood Forest began. He'd spent his entire life in these woods, learning the ins and outs of the trade from his father before him. The rhythmic crash of the river against its banks and the soft hoots of owls in the distance were familiar comforts to Kaidën, but he knew that this tranquil existence was about to be disrupted – and by more than just the daily grind.

As he walked down to the dock to start his day's work, Kaidën noticed a strange, unmarked boat tied to the railing. It looked old, its wooden hull worn smooth in places, with intricate carvings of leaves and vines etched into the rail. A faded letter attached to the bow caught his eye: "To whoever finds this, beware the darkness that lurks beneath the surface."

Kaidën's curiosity was piqued, but he pushed the thought aside for now, focusing on the day ahead – one that promised to be anything but ordinary in the Blackwood Forest.
