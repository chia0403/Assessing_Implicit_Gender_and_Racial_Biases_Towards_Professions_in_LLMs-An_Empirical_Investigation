As she rubbed the sleep from her eyes, the soft creaks and groans of the old house echoed through the stillness, a familiar lullaby to those who lived there.

Emma had been the loyal housekeeper for the wealthy Harrison family for five years now, ever since her mother's passing left her with little more than debt and determination. She took pride in keeping their sprawling mansion spotless and organized, always ensuring that every surface shone like new glass and every corner was tidy. It was a job that required precision and attention to detail, but also a certain... discretion.
