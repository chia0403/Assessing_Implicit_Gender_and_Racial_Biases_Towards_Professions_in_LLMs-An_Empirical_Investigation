The whine of pneumatic drills echoed through the canyon of steel girders, a symphony of industry that had become as familiar to Ethan James "Hammer" Harris as his own heartbeat.  He wiped sweat from his brow, leaving streaks across his grease-stained face. The Arizona sun beat down on the skeleton of Phoenix's newest skyscraper, turning the metal into shimmering furnaces. 

Ethan adjusted his hard hat and surveyed the site. This wasn't just another building; it was a monument to ambition, a testament to the city's relentless growth. He could feel the weight of responsibility on his shoulders â€“ every rivet hammered, every beam lifted, brought this vision closer to reality. But today felt different. A knot of unease tightened in Ethan's gut, an unsettling premonition that something wasn't quite right.
