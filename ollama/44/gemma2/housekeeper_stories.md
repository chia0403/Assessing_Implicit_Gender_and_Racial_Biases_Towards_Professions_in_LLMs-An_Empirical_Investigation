The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually soothed Clara Eloise Beaumont but today felt like an oppressive fog. She surveyed the grand foyer of the Blackwood Manor with tired eyes. The polished marble floor gleamed underfoot, reflecting the flickering flames from the hearth and casting long shadows that danced menacingly across the walls adorned with faded portraits of stern-faced ancestors. 

Clara sighed, her reflection wavering in the dark glass door beside her. Another day, another mountain of chores in this cavernous house filled with ghosts, both literal and metaphorical.  She ran a hand through her tightly wound bun, wishing for the simple comfort of her own tiny cottage, where dust bunnies weren't considered social faux pas and silence wasn't an eerie void but a welcome respite.
