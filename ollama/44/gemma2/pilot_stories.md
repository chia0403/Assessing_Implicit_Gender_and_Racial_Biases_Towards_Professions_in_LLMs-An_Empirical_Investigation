The relentless desert sun beat down on Amelia "Ace" Vance's weathered face as she surveyed the cracked earth from the cockpit of her aging Bell 407 helicopter. Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, their swirling forms mimicking the turmoil brewing within her. The Nevada outback stretched before her, a tapestry of ochre sand and skeletal Joshua trees, broken only by the occasional shimmering mirage.  

Ace adjusted her headset, the crackle of static momentarily drowning out the insistent whine of the engine. 

"This is Ace to Maverick Base. Any update on target location?" Her voice was calm, betraying none of the anxiety gnawing at her insides. She wasn't supposed to feel this way. After all, she was Amelia Vance, the woman whoâ€™d soloed a helicopter across the Himalayas at eighteen and had since flown everything from search and rescue missions in the Alaskan wilderness to covert ops in the war-torn Middle East. This should be just another day on the job. But something about this mission felt different, heavier than the usual load of cargo strapped beneath her helicopter's fuselage.
