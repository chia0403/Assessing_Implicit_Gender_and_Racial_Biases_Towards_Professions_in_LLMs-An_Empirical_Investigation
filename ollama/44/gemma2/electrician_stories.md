The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Cicadas thrummed their incessant song as Elara Mae "Ellie" Dubois climbed the rickety wooden steps leading to Mrs. LeBreton's porch. Her toolbox, its metal warm against her thigh, felt reassuringly familiar. Ellie squinted at the sun-bleached paint peeling from the roofline, imagining the tangled mess of wires she'd be untangling inside. 

Mrs. LeBretonâ€™s house was a Victorian relic perched precariously on stilts above the bayou, its once vibrant gingerbread trim now faded and weathered. The wind whispered through the gaps in the clapboard siding, carrying with it the mournful cry of a distant boat horn and the faint scent of saltwater. Ellie took a deep breath, bracing herself for the day's work. Every spark she extinguished brought a flicker of light to this forgotten corner of Louisiana, reminding her that even in the midst of decay, there was always something worth saving.
