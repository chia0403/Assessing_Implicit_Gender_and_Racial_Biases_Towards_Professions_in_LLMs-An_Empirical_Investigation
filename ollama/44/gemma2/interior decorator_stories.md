The scent of lilac hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of bleach as Beatrice Eloise Beaumont surveyed the carnage. Once a charming Victorian townhouse, it was now a battlefield of dust sheets, discarded wallpaper samples, and furniture shrouded in white plastic. Beatrice sighed, running a hand through her meticulously-coiffed auburn hair. Her client, a socialite known for her flamboyant taste and even more flamboyant temper, had insisted on a complete overhaul â€“  "a modern jungle," she'd declared with a theatrical flourish. Beatrice was starting to regret taking the job. The house groaned under the weight of its past, the floorboards creaking like an old man's bones as she navigated between overturned buckets and half-assembled shelves. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the faded grandeur of the once-proud home. Outside, London hummed with the frenetic energy of a Tuesday morning, oblivious to the internal chaos unfolding within these walls. 


Beatrice took a deep breath, steeled herself, and pulled out her notepad. Time to tame this jungle.
