The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Eleanor Vance's head, casting a sterile glow over the neat rows of lumbar pillows and reflexology mats. The scent of lavender essential oil hung heavy in the air, masking the faint metallic tang that always seemed to cling to her office after a particularly strenuous adjustment session. Outside, the rhythmic rumble of traffic on Elm Street served as a constant backdrop, punctuated by the occasional screech of brakes or excited bark from a passing dog.

Eleanor sighed, pushing aside a stack of insurance forms with a weary hand. The late afternoon lull was always the worst. It wasn't the silence itself that bothered her, but the weight of anticipation that came with it â€“ the knowledge that soon, another patient would walk through the door, bearing their own burden of pain and frustration, hoping for relief in the form of her expertise.


Today, she felt particularly drained. The lingering ache in her lower back, a consequence of an overly enthusiastic session with Mr. Henderson earlier that morning, served as a constant reminder of the physical toll her profession took.  But despite the weariness, Eleanor wouldn't trade her work for anything. There was something deeply satisfying about helping people reclaim their mobility and well-being, about seeing the flicker of relief in their eyes when a tight knot finally loosened, replaced by a sense of lightness they hadn't felt in weeks, months, even years.
