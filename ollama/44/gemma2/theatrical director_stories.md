The air hung thick with the scent of stale sweat, anticipation, and cheap hairspray backstage at the Grand Majestic Theatre. It was opening night for "Electra's Fury," a tempestuous adaptation of the Greek tragedy, and Ophelia Beatrice Blackwood, Director Extraordinaire (as she insisted on being called), paced like a caged lioness. 

Her crimson silk blouse strained against her sharp collarbones, mirroring the tension radiating from her every pore. A tangle of auburn hair escaped its messy bun, framing eyes that flickered between the stage door and the frantic scribbling of stage manager Harold "Harry" Perkins on his clipboard.  

The Grand Majestic, a relic of a bygone era with ornate velvet curtains and peeling gold leaf trim, had seen better days. Its grandeur was now a faded memory, clinging to its existence like cobwebs in the rafters. Ophelia knew that without a roaring success this week, the theatre would be condemned to another year of scraping by on lukewarm community productions and dwindling ticket sales.  And she, Ophelia Beatrice Blackwood, wouldn't allow it.
