The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Finch's back, turning his already sweat-slicked shirt into a second skin. He adjusted his safety harness, the worn leather digging into his shoulders, and surveyed the dilapidated Victorian mansion before him. The shingles were brittle, curling at the edges like forgotten promises, and gaping holes in the roof threatened to swallow the remnants of summer sunshine. This was Eli's kind of challenge -  a puzzle made of weathered wood and twisted metal, begging to be pieced back together.

The sprawling house sat on a quiet street in Maplewood, its gingerbread trim faded and peeling, like an old woman's lipstick after a long day. Each room held whispers of past laughter and whispered secrets, stories etched into the warped floorboards and cracked plaster walls.  Eli could almost hear the echoes of children playing in the overgrown garden, their voices carried on the warm summer breeze that rustled through the gnarled oak tree shading the porch. But now, silence reigned supreme. The windows were boarded up, dust coating everything like a shroud, and the only sound was the rhythmic hammering of Eli's tool against shingle after shingle, his work a defiant act against the encroaching decay.
