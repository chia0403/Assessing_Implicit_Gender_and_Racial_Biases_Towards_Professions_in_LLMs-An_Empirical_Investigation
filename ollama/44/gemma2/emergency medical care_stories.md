Amy gripped the stretcher handles, her knuckles white against the worn metal, as they hurtled towards their next call: a possible cardiac arrest at a crowded concert venue. 


The adrenaline thrummed in her veins, a familiar cocktail that both energized and calmed her. She was a soldier in this city's battlefield, responding to the cries for help amidst the relentless hum of life. Tonight, another story was about to unfold, another life hanging in the balance.
