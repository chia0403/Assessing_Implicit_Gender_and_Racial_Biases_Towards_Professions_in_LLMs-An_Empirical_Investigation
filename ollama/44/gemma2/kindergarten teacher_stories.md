The aroma of burnt popcorn hung heavy in the air, mingling with the cloying sweetness of hand-sanitizer and the faint scent of glue stick residue.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Miss Eloise Beatrice Butterfield's kindergarten classroom, illuminating swirling motes of dust dancing in the golden beams. 

Miss Butterfield, a woman whose fiery red hair seemed to defy gravity with its perpetual bounce, surveyed her domain with a weary sigh.  Crayon drawings adorned the walls, each one a testament to the boundless imagination and questionable artistic talent of her five-year-old charges. A half-eaten graham cracker lay nestled amongst building blocks on the floor, evidence of an unfinished snack time adventure.

It was the last day before spring break, and Miss Butterfield could practically taste the freedom.  Just one more day of finger painting, circle time singalongs, and navigating the emotional minefield that was a classroom full of five-year-olds who were still figuring out sharing, turn-taking, and the concept of personal space.
