The bell above the door tinkled its cheerful welcome, but Eloise Petalwood hardly noticed. Her hands were stained with crimson carnations, a vibrant red that mirrored the anger blooming in her chest. 

Eloise's Flower Haven wasn't just a shop; it was an extension of her soul. Every bloom, every vase, every fragrant sprig spoke of her love for life and beauty. But lately, her haven felt more like a battlefield. The once-bustling flower market had become flooded with cheap imports, and customers were flocking to the discount blooms over Eloise's carefully curated arrangements.  

Her small shop, nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Willow Creek, was usually bathed in sunlight streaming through the dusty glass windows. Today, though, a heavy fog hung low, mirroring the gloom settling over her hopes. Rain splattered against the windowpanes, blurring the colorful displays within and casting long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. 


The scent of lilies and jasmine, normally so comforting, felt heavy with despair. Eloise sighed, wiping her hands on her apron, a delicate floral pattern faded from years of use. She was losing her fight, one wilting petal at a time.
