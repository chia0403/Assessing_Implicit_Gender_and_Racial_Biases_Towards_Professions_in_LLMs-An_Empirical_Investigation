Rain lashed against the windows of Thorne & Hawthorne's 14th-floor office, blurring the lights of Chicago into an impressionist painting of gold and crimson. Inside, Amelia Claire Bellweather, a paralegal known for her unyielding tenacity and an organizational system rivaling that of the Library of Congress, sat hunched over a mountain of files. The scent of stale coffee and anxiety hung heavy in the air. Her boss, Mr. Hawthorne, had just returned from a meeting with a notorious land developer, his face ashen and tight-lipped. Amelia knew this wasn't good. 

Mr. Hawthorne’s voice, usually a baritone rumble, was now a strained whisper as he addressed her. "Amelia," he began, pushing a particularly thick file across the desk. "This is big. This could make or break us. Get me everything you can on this developer, every contract, every connection, every shady deal. We need to be prepared for anything." 


The file, titled “Project Phoenix,” felt heavy in Amelia’s hands. A shiver ran down her spine. The rain outside seemed to intensify, mirroring the storm brewing within the walls of Thorne & Hawthorne.
