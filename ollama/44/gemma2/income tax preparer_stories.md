The fluorescent lights hummed above Agnes Pemberton's head, casting a pale, sickly glow on the mountains of paperwork that threatened to engulf her small office. Outside, the January air was crisp and clean, promising the start of a new year, but inside, the only thing new was the smell of stale coffee and desperation clinging to the worn linoleum floor. Agnes sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose as she wrestled with a particularly convoluted W-2 form.

Her tiny office, tucked away on the second floor of a nondescript brick building in downtown Davenport, Iowa, felt more like a besieged fortress than a place of business. Every chair was occupied by clients, their faces etched with anxiety and resignation. They shuffled papers nervously, coughed into folded tissues, and fidgeted under Agnes' steady gaze.

Agnes Pemberton, seasoned income tax preparer extraordinaire, was their last hope for navigating the labyrinthine world of forms, deductions, and credits. She was a fortress herself, armed with a vast knowledge of the tax code and an unwavering commitment to fairness â€“ even if that meant battling with the IRS on behalf of someone who couldn't afford a lawyer.
