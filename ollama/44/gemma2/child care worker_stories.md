The rhythmic thump-thump of twenty toddlers' feet echoed through the brightly colored playroom at Wee Care Daycare.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, painting squares of warmth on the worn linoleum floor where Amelia "Amy" Rose Harper knelt, sorting blocks by color with a small group of four-year-olds. Amy's heart swelled with a familiar mix of love and exhaustion. It was almost nap time – a magical hour when the chaos subsided into blissful silence, leaving behind only the soft murmur of slumbering children and the faint scent of crayons and Playdoh.

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Amy's spine, like a stray thought refusing to be ignored. The children seemed unusually subdued, their usual boisterous energy muted. And then there was Mrs. Periwinkle, the owner of Wee Care, who stood rigid by the snack table, her face pale and drawn. 

"Everything alright, Mrs. P?" Amy asked, trying to sound casual.  Mrs. Periwinkle's response was a nervous swallow and a frantic glance at the closed door leading to the back office. A shiver ran down Amy’s spine. This wasn't like her usually unflappable boss. Something was very wrong. 


**Setting:** Wee Care Daycare, a small, brightly colored building on a quiet suburban street.
