The scent of rain-slicked pavement and jasmine hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile neutrality of Dr. Eleanor Violet Thorne's office. Outside, San Francisco hummed with its usual frenetic energy, but within these walls, silence reigned. Eleanor sat perched on the edge of her leather couch, fingers tapping a restless rhythm against the armrest. She watched the clock tick past 4:00 pm, the designated starting time for her session with Mr. Alistair Finch, a man she'd been expecting all week.

Mr. Finch was scheduled to be Eleanor's most challenging case yet: a reclusive tech billionaire plagued by nightmares so vivid they bled into his waking life. His website, plastered across every digital billboard in the city, promised innovative solutions for mental well-being. Yet, Alistair himself couldn't seem to find peace within his own mind.

Eleanor adjusted her glasses, the faint amber lenses reflecting the warm glow emanating from her desk lamp. Her heart ached with anticipation â€“ a mix of professional curiosity and personal empathy. As a former trauma survivor herself, she understood the power of nightmares and the fear they could instil.  She hoped she could offer Alistair not just therapy, but a sliver of the solace she had fought so hard to find within her own darkness. 


The office door creaked open, breaking the tense silence. Eleanor looked up, ready to greet her new patient.
