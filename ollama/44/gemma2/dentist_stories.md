The air in Dr. Eleanor Vance's office always smelled faintly of antiseptic and mint. Not that it mattered much; most patients were too focused on their imminent tooth extractions to notice anything beyond the whirring drill. The waiting room, however, was another story.  

Eleanor had meticulously curated a haven for anxious smiles â€“ plush teal armchairs, soft jazz playing at a low hum, and sunlight filtering through stained glass windows, casting rainbows across the worn Persian rug. It wasn't always enough to calm the fluttering hearts of her patients, but it helped. 

Today, however, even Eleanor couldn't ignore the tension crackling in the air. A young woman sat rigid in one of the armchairs, her knuckles white against the soft teal fabric. Her eyes darted around the room, landing on anything but the framed botanical prints on the wall or the cheerful bowl of ceramic sunflowers overflowing with lilies. 


She was clearly terrified.  And that, Eleanor knew, meant only one thing: this wasn't just a regular checkup. This was about something more. Something bigger.
