The engine hummed a steady lullaby as Elias Thorne wrestled the eighteen-wheeler around the tight bend in the Arizona desert highway. His CB crackled to life with a string of static before spitting out a gravelly voice: "Roadkill ahead, truckers! Looks like a deer took a shortcut to heaven." Elias grimaced and rolled his eyes. Roadkill was an unwelcome companion on this desolate stretch of Route 66, but he wasn't about to be the one taking any shortcuts himself. He eased his rig down, squinting at the sun-bleached landscape that stretched before him like a canvas of endless ochre and burnt sienna. The heat shimmered off the asphalt, blurring the horizon into a hazy mirage.  


Elias had been hauling freight across this swathe of desolate beauty for fifteen years. It wasn't glamorous, but it was honest work. He lived in his rig, his only companions being his trusty hound dog, Maverick, and the ghosts of truckers past who whispered through the wind and rattled in the chrome of his beloved Peterbilt.  The setting sun cast long shadows as he rolled into a dusty roadside diner, hoping for a hot meal and a moment's respite from the endless journey.
