Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the tempest raging within her own mind. She stared at the swirling patterns in her coffee, each eddy resembling a question mark, a plea for answers.  Her small practice, nestled on a quiet street in upstate New York, was usually a sanctuary – a haven of muted pastels and calming aromas designed to ease anxieties. But today, even the gentle scent of lavender couldn't quell the rising unease.

Eleanor’s phone had buzzed earlier that day, shattering the peaceful routine. It was the hospital, calling about a new patient - an enigmatic young man named Thomas Blackwood, admitted for what they vaguely termed "psychological distress." He hadn't spoken a word since arriving. 

She didn't know what awaited her in Thomas’s silence. Was it fear? Despair? Or something else entirely – something that whispered of secrets buried deep, waiting to be unearthed? Eleanor took a sip of her coffee, its bitterness a mirror to the knot forming in her stomach. The storm outside intensified, mirroring the one brewing within her as she prepared to face the unknown.
