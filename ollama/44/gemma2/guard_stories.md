The biting wind whipped across the plains, tearing at Seraphina Briarshield's cloak as she scanned the desolate landscape. The sun, a pale disc behind the swirling grey clouds, offered little warmth against the chill that seeped into her bones. Before her stretched the barren expanse of the Frostbite Expanse, an unforgiving wasteland punctuated by jagged rock formations and skeletal trees stripped bare by winter. 

Seraphina tightened her grip on her spear, its cold steel a familiar comfort in this desolate place.  The wind whistled through the gaps in her armour, carrying whispers of long-dead creatures and tales of forgotten battles fought against unimaginable horrors. It was a landscape that tested the soul, and only the strongest survived.

She was no stranger to hardship. Seraphina Briarshield, daughter of a fallen lord and sworn protector of the fragile border town of Everfrost, had known little but struggle since her childhood. Today, her duty was simple: patrol the perimeter, keep watch for any sign of movement in the expanse, and ensure the safety of the people within Everfrost's walls. But even in its simplicity, the task held a weight that pressed down on her like the ever-present snow. The whispers carried more than just tales; they carried a fear, a primal dread that gnawed at the edges of her resolve. 


The Expanse was a place where legends were born and nightmares walked freely. And today, Seraphina felt it watching her.
