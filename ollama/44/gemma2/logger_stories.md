The mist clung to the Douglas firs like a shroud, muffling the usual symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves. Elias Blackwood squinted through the damp air, his calloused hands gripping the rough bark of the giant redwood beside him. The scent of pine needles and damp earth filled his lungs, a familiar comfort in this world of towering giants and silent shadows.  

Elias was born into this life, raised amongst these ancient forests on the edge of the Olympic Peninsula. His father had taught him everything he knew: how to read the language of the trees, how to fell them with respect, how to harness their power without destroying their spirit. But Elias’s world was changing. The whispers in the logging camps spoke of a new threat – mechanized machines, hungry for wood and indifferent to the ancient rhythms of the forest. 


They called these machines "the iron giants," and Elias felt a shiver of unease crawl down his spine as he watched their tracks scar the forest floor, deeper and wider than any human could ever carve. He knew that soon, they would come for his father’s trees, the ones that had stood sentinel over generations.
