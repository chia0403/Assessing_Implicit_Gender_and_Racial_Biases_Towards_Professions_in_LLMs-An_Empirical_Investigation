The hum of the fluorescent lights overhead buzzed like a swarm of angry bees, adding to the symphony of coughs and rustling papers echoing through the near-empty lecture hall.  Elias Thorne, his weary eyes shielded by the brim of his faded baseball cap, shuffled across the cold linoleum floor, his worn janitorial cart rumbling behind him. Outside, the last rays of sunset painted the Chicago skyline in hues of orange and violet, a stark contrast to the sterile grey that permeated the university building. 

Elias hated these late-night shifts. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the occasional groan of pipes or the distant clink of glass bottles from a nearby dorm party.  He preferred the daytime buzz â€“ the clatter of footsteps, the murmur of students, the occasional forgotten textbook he could salvage for his daughter's burgeoning collection. But tonight, it was just him, the ghosts of forgotten lectures, and the ever-present scent of stale coffee and disappointment.
