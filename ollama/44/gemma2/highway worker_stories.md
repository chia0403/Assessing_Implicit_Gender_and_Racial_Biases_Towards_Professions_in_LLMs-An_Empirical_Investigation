The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Montgomery's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he maneuvered the road grader along Highway 17, scraping away asphalt and smoothing out the rough patch caused by last week's hailstorm. The rhythmic rumble of the machine was the soundtrack to his workday, a familiar lullaby in this desolate stretch of Nevada desert.

Eli squinted at the shimmering heat waves rising off the blacktop. In the distance, the skeletal remains of long-abandoned wind turbines clawed at the sky, monuments to forgotten dreams and failed promises. The only other sign of life was the occasional tumbleweed rolling across the cracked earth like a miniature, dusty apocalypse survivor. He'd been working on this highway for five years, patching up its imperfections and enduring its monotony. This stretch of road was as much a part of him as his calloused hands and sun-baked skin.  

Today, however, felt different. A prickling sensation ran down Eli's spine, an unease he couldnâ€™t shake. The radio crackled with static, the usual country music replaced by a high-pitched whine that sent chills crawling up his arms. He glanced at the rearview mirror. No one behind him. Just the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching into the hazy horizon.
