The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and burnt sugar.  A thin sheen of powdered sugar coated everything - tables, countertops, even Elara Beatrice Frost's unruly auburn braid. It was Saturday morning, the busiest time at "Frosting Fancies," Elara's small bakery tucked away on a quiet side street in Maplewood. Outside, the rumble of autumn leaves crunching underfoot competed with the cheerful tinkling of the shop bell as customers entered. 

Elara wiped her hands on her flour-dusted apron, catching a glimpse of herself in the glass display case.  Her hazel eyes sparkled with a mix of exhaustion and excitement. She loved this chaos, this whirlwind of orders and happy faces. Today was no different. A line of eager customers snaked down the aisle, their breaths puffing out little clouds in the cool morning air. 

Elara took a deep breath, her heart thrumming with the familiar rhythm of a Saturday rush.  It was going to be a good day.
