The aroma of stale coffee and adolescent angst hung heavy in the air of Ms. Eleanor Vance’s office. A worn tapestry depicting a serene mountain lake, clearly chosen for its calming effect on stressed-out teens, did little to mask the faint scent of desperation clinging to the room's faded blue walls. Outside, the relentless drizzle beat against the windows of Northwood High, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor as she stared at the crumpled note in her hand. It was from David Miller, a freshman with eyes that seemed perpetually burdened by unseen weight. His request was simple: "Help me disappear."


Eleanor knew that disappearing wasn't an option for David, or any of the students who poured their hopes and fears into her worn-out armchair. She had to find a way to help him, even if he wasn’t willing to meet face-to-face.  The clock ticked relentlessly towards dismissal, each second another reminder that she had less than an hour before the deluge of teenage anxieties reached its peak. This was just another Tuesday at Northwood High, where the weight of the world often seemed to rest on the shoulders of teenagers, and Eleanor Vance was their reluctant anchor.
