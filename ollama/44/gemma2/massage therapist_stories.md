The air hung heavy with lavender and eucalyptus in Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s tiny studio. Rain hammered against the skylight, mimicking the steady rhythm of her fingers kneading Mr. Henderson's tense shoulders. His breaths, shallow at first, deepened into sighs as she worked, the tension in his neck easing with every stroke. 

Amelia loved this part – the transformation, the quiet symphony of muscle and touch.  Her little haven tucked away on a side street in Portland was her sanctuary, a place where she could soothe not just bodies but souls weary from the relentless churn of city life. Outside, the world might be grey and gritty, but within these four walls, Amelia crafted moments of tranquility. 


But today, even the comforting scent of essential oils couldn't quite mask the prickle of unease crawling up Amelia's spine. A new client had booked, someone she didn't recognize from her usual clientele. And when Mr. Henderson mentioned a "shadowy figure" lurking outside the building earlier, a shiver ran down her spine that had nothing to do with the chill autumn air seeping in through the cracks.
