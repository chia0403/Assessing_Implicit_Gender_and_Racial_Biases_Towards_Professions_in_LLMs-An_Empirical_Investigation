The biting wind whipped through Clara Evangeline Bell's auburn hair as she hunched deeper into her trench coat. The smell of stale fish and salt hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of burning rubber from the ferry terminal across the harbor. A lone streetlamp cast an anemic glow on the cobblestone streets of Grimsborough, highlighting the puddles that mirrored the bruised sky above. 

Clara shifted the worn notebook in her satchel, its leather cool against her hip. She was new to this town, a faded speck on the map at the edge of the world where the North Atlantic churned restlessly.  She'd come looking for a story, any story that would make her career worth something more than lukewarm coffee and endless rejections. And she'd found it, whispered in hushed tones by the weathered fishermen huddled in the tavern down the street: the disappearance of the Grimsborough Siren, the legendary vessel said to sail only under the light of the full moon.
