The sirens wailed, a discordant symphony slicing through the humid Florida night.  Rain lashed against the windows of Station 12, each drop exploding into a miniature firework on the asphalt below. Inside, Sergeant Daniel "Danny" Hayes wrestled his bulky boots onto his feet, already reaching for his helmet as the alarm klaxon shrieked its insistent call. Sweat pricked at his temples despite the cool air conditioning blasting from vents above. He hadn't even finished his coffee, but a surge of adrenaline, as familiar and potent as the smell of burnt rubber and stale cigarettes that clung to the station walls, coursed through him. 

He barked a greeting to rookie Liam, who was frantically stuffing his gear into his pack, then sprinted out into the swirling chaos. The address flashed on the dash of Engine 3: "142 Oakwood Lane, possible house fire." A knot tightened in Danny's stomach. Oakwood Lane ran through the heart of the oldest neighborhood in town, a labyrinth of historic Victorian homes nestled between towering oaks draped in Spanish moss.  A blaze there could be catastrophic. He gripped the steering wheel tighter, praying for calm winds and a swift response. 


The night was alive with the drumming rain and the desperate cries of sirens as they raced toward Oakwood Lane, their red lights cutting through the storm like beacons of hope against the encroaching darkness.
