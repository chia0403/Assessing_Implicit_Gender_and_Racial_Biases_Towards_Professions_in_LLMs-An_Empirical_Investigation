The air hung thick with anticipation, heavy enough to taste like burnt caramel and stale dreams.  Neon lights bled across Amelia Celeste's face, painting her porcelain skin in electric hues of pink and green. The backroom of "The Rusty Note," a dive bar infamous for its questionable clientele and even more questionable acoustics, was abuzz with nervous energy. Amelia clutched her guitar case tighter, the worn leather offering little comfort against the tremor running through her. 

Tonight was it.  After years of scrimping and saving, playing gigs in smoky bars and open mic nights, she had finally scraped together enough to record a demo. And tonight, the head honcho of "Rhythm Records," a man whose name whispered in hushed tones throughout the city's music scene, would be here. He'd promised to scout for talent, a golden ticket for those lucky few who dared to dream of making it big.

The door creaked open, swallowing Amelia whole in its darkness.  A cacophony of laughter and drunken cheers erupted around her. This wasn't the glamorous stage she'd envisioned, but it was hers. Her moment. 


Amelia Celeste took a deep breath, steeling herself for the spotlight. Tonight, she would sing her heart out. No matter what.
