The grand lobby of The Grandview Hotel hummed with an energy that never truly died, even in the dead of night.  Fluorescent lights buzzed above, casting long shadows from the ornate chandeliers that hung like crystal spiders from the vaulted ceiling. Evelyn Beatrice "Evie" Bellweather, a girl barely old enough to shave, darted between tourists and businessmen, her bellhop uniform a sea of navy blue amidst the kaleidoscope of designer luggage.  She was small for her age, with fiery red hair perpetually escaping its braid and eyes that missed nothing - not the subtle shift in a guest's expression, not the telltale gleam of a misplaced credit card, not even the way Mr. Henderson from room 314 always left his newspaper crumpled on the floor by the door.  Evie was quick, efficient, and observant, making her one of The Grandview's most valued employees, despite her youth.

Tonight, however, Evie felt a prickle of unease. A dense fog had rolled in earlier, shrouding the city in an unsettling silence that pressed against the windows like a damp hand. And there was something different about the air - a faint metallic tang, like pennies left too long in rain water. As she took Mr. Henderson's suitcase to his room, Evie couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that something was terribly, unsettlingly wrong.
