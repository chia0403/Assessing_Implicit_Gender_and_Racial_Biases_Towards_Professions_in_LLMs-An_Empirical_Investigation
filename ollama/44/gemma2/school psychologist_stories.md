The scent of stale pizza and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to Eleanor Vance like a second skin. It was lunchtime at Meadowbrook Elementary, and the cacophony of chattering children, scraping chairs, and the occasional shriek of laughter echoed through the fluorescent-lit cafeteria.  

Eleanor, a woman whose auburn hair had begun to pull in with age but who still wore it pulled back in a neat braid, sat perched on a stool at her desk tucked away in a corner. She wasn't eating – her lunch was a half-eaten apple she’d shoved into her purse that morning -  too preoccupied with the swirling emotions of the child waiting for her next. A boy named Daniel, nine years old and already burdened by an anxiety so profound it had begun to manifest in physical symptoms: headaches, nausea, even hiccups at times. 


Eleanor flipped through his file, her brow furrowing as she reread his recent assessments. Something wasn't right. The numbers, while alarming, didn't quite paint the full picture. Daniel's anxiety was more than just a fear of school; it felt like a creeping darkness, an unspoken terror that threatened to consume him.
