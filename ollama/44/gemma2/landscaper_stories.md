The sun beat down on Evelyn Beatrice Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat trickled into her eyes, blurring the manicured edges of Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning rose bushes. "Gotta keep these beauties trimmed," she muttered to herself, snipping away at a rogue stem with practiced precision.  The air hung heavy with the scent of freshly cut grass and honeysuckle, mingling with the faint aroma of sunscreen and exhaust from the passing cars on Oak Street. 

Evelyn's work was more than just trimming hedges and planting petunias; it was an art form. She sculpted the landscape into poems of green, weaving vibrant blooms and sturdy shrubs into stories that unfolded across every lawn. But this particular afternoon, even her artistic inspiration felt wilted under the relentless July sun. A sense of unease prickled at the back of her neck, a feeling she couldn't quite place. The neighborhood felt...off. 


The setting is an idyllic, leafy suburb in late summer, where every lawn seems to be vying for the title of "Best in Show."  Evelyn lives and works here, her knowledge of each house and its inhabitants as intimate as her own backyard.
