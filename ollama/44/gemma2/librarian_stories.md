The air in the Oakhaven Public Library always smelled faintly of old paper and lavender polish. It was a scent Eloise Amelia Cartwright found comforting, grounding her amidst the whirlwind of deadlines, temperamental patrons, and the ever-present threat of budget cuts that haunted every small town library. She ran a finger along the spine of “Jane Eyre,” its worn leather a testament to countless borrowed journeys, then sighed as she glanced at the overflowing donation box beside her desk. 

Oakhaven was nestled in the heart of Vermont, a place where the autumn leaves blazed with fiery hues and snow blanketed the ground for months on end. The library, a stately brick building with arched windows overlooking the town square, was its beating heart – a haven for dreamers, scholars, and anyone seeking refuge from the biting cold or the humdrum of daily life.  

But lately, even Eloise felt a chill in her bones, a sense of unease that had nothing to do with the approaching winter. There were whispers in the town, strange occurrences in the old sections of the library, and a book – an ancient tome bound in blackened leather – had appeared on her desk without explanation.  It was as if Oakhaven itself was holding its breath, waiting for something...something momentous. And Eloise, with her love for stories and her unwavering dedication to her beloved library, found herself drawn into the mystery before it could fully unfold.
