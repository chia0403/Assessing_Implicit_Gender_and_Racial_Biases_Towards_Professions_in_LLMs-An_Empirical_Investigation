The air hung thick with the scent of lilac and coconut shampoo in Vivienne Celeste’s salon, “Celestial Styles.”  Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air. Outside, the bustle of New Orleans on Magazine Street hummed like a lazy beehive, but within those walls, time seemed to move at its own, languid pace. 

Vivienne, a woman with eyes as blue and bright as the Louisiana sky after a summer rain and hair always styled into intricate braids adorned with beads, was expertly weaving a tapestry of color onto her client's head. Her nimble fingers worked magic, transforming plain brunette strands into a riot of auburn and gold, each highlight strategically placed to accentuate her client's freckled face and mischievous smile. 


Vivienne loved this part of her day: the quiet focus, the transformation, the connection she forged with each woman who sat in her chair.  But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, a feeling that something was about to unravel, like a loose thread threatening to pull apart the carefully woven fabric of her life.
