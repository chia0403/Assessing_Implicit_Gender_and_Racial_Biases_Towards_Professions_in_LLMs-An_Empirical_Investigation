The rusted pipes shrieked their complaints like banshees as Harold Percival Worthington III wrestled with the stubborn coupling beneath the sink. Sweat beaded on his forehead, reflecting the harsh fluorescent light of Mrs. Periwinkle's cramped kitchen. The air was thick with the stench of stagnant water and despair – a familiar aroma for any plumber worth his salt, or at least, that's what Harold liked to tell himself.  

Harold’s small van, emblazoned with “Worthington’s Whiz-Bang Plumbing: When Things Go Down, We Bring Them Up!”, sat sputtering outside the Victorian house like a wounded seagull on its last legs. It was a reflection of his current life: worn down, struggling to keep afloat in a city that seemed determined to drown him. 

Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose face resembled a crumpled tissue paper and whose voice wavered between a croak and a squeak, watched Harold with the same intensity she reserved for her prize-winning begonias. "You best fix it quick, Mr. Worthington," she rasped, her gaze flitting to the rapidly accumulating puddle on the linoleum floor. "I have a very important meeting with my bridge club this afternoon."


This, thought Harold, was not going to be a good day.
