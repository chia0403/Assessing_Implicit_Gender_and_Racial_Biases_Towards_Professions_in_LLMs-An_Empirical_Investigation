The scent of burnt sugar hung thick in the air, a bittersweet perfume that clung to Amelia Grace Thornberry like a second skin. It was a smell she both loved and loathed, a constant reminder of her ambition and her failings. The warmth of the brick oven behind her pressed against her back, its heat mimicking the simmering frustration bubbling within her. 

Amelia’s bakery, "The Whispering Hearth," sat tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Oldbury. Once, this quaint town had been bustling with life, a vibrant hub for merchants and travelers alike. Now, it was fading into a melancholic echo of its former self, its buildings draped in moss and its streets hushed except for the occasional clatter of hooves and the mournful cry of crows. The Hearth, too, reflected this slow decline – once a haven for laughter and the aroma of freshly baked bread, now struggling to stay afloat amidst dwindling customers and fierce competition from the gleaming, modern bakery that had sprung up on the outskirts of town.


Amelia’s hands, dusted with flour and stained with berry juice, rested on the worn countertop. Her gaze fell upon the lopsided gingerbread men, their icing eyes staring blankly into the emptiness of the shop. It was a Tuesday afternoon, the quietest time of the week, and Amelia felt the weight of her responsibility settle heavily upon her shoulders.
