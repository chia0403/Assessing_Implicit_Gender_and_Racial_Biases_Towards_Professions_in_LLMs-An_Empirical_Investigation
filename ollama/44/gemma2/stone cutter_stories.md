The air hung heavy with the scent of granite dust and sweat in Bartholomew Thistlewick's workshop. Sunlight slanted through the dusty panes of glass, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness. Outside, the village of Hollow Creek slumbered beneath a blanket of early morning mist. But within these walls, time moved differently, governed by the rhythmic clang of hammer against stone. 

Bartholomew, his calloused hands resting on the cool surface of a half-finished sculpture, surveyed his work with a critical eye. The granite, quarried from the treacherous peaks overlooking Hollow Creek, yielded reluctantly to his chisel. It was stubborn, demanding respect and precision, much like the man himself. 

He was known throughout the village for his artistry, for his ability to coax life from seemingly inanimate rock.  His sculptures graced the homes of prosperous merchants, the altars of the local temple, and even the grand palace in the distant capital. Yet, Bartholomew found solace not in accolades, but in the simple act of creation, in the tactile dance between stone and steel. 


This morning, however, his usual concentration was fractured. A letter, sealed with crimson wax, lay unopened on his workbench, a stark contrast to the rough textures surrounding it. The sender was unknown, the inscription simply: “Bartholomew Thistlewick, You hold the key.”
