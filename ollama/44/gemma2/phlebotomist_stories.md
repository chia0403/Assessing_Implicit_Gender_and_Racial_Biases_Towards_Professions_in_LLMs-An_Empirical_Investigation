The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Seraphina's head like a chorus of impatient bees. She could feel their buzz vibrating through her worn-out scrubs as she meticulously cleaned the armrests and tray table in her assigned station. It was just past 7:00 AM, and the first wave of patients were beginning to trickle into the bustling phlebotomy lab at Mercy General Hospital.

Elara hated mornings. Not because she disliked the quiet before the chaos, but because it meant a fresh batch of nervous faces, pale under fluorescent lights, flinching at the sight of her needle kit. She knew their fear –  the prickling anticipation of pain, the metallic tang of blood in their mouths, the overwhelming sense of vulnerability. And she carried a deep empathy for them, born from years of witnessing this ritual play out countless times, each patient's story unfolding in the taut lines on their faces, the hesitant breaths they took. But she also knew how to ease their fear. She had a knack for finding their weak spots – a funny joke about the hospital food, a genuine question about their day – anything to distract them from the prick. It was her small way of making things less scary, less clinical, less like an impending doom. 


Today, however, Elara felt a tremor of unease herself.  There was a tension in the air, a hushed anxiety that she couldn’t quite place. Perhaps it was the unusually high number of patients or maybe just her own frayed nerves from the week's relentless schedule. Whatever it was, it sat like a cold stone in her stomach. As the first patient shuffled into her station, Elara took a deep breath, steeling herself for the day ahead, hoping to find calm amidst the swirling chaos.
