The whir of the electric typewriter was a familiar lullaby to Beatrice "Bea" Lavender-Smith. Every morning, just as the pale London sun cast its weak rays through the grimy windowpanes of Mr. Fitzwilliam's office, Bea would switch it on and settle into her routine. Her day revolved around dictation: terse legal memos, letters laced with veiled threats, occasionally a surprisingly heartfelt appeal for clemency. 

The year was 1953, and Mr. Fitzwilliam, a renowned barrister known for his sharp wit and even sharper suits, held court in his small yet cluttered office tucked away on the second floor of an aging building in Holborn. The air always smelled faintly of pipe tobacco and old paper, a comforting aroma to Bea that spoke of order and predictability.  Outside, London was a city on the cusp of change: the austerity of war years fading, replaced by a tentative optimism, yet within Mr. Fitzwilliam's office, time seemed to move at a slower, more deliberate pace. 


But today, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than usual. Mr. Fitzwilliam, usually so jovial, was silent, his face drawn and pale beneath his neatly trimmed mustache. His eyes, normally twinkling with mischief, held an unsettling glint of anxiety. He tapped impatiently on his desk, a nervous habit Bea knew well only meant one thing: trouble. And in Beatrice Lavender-Smith's world, trouble often came disguised as a letter, waiting to be deciphered.
