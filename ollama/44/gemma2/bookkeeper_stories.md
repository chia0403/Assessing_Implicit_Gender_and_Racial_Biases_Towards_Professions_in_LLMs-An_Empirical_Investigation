The flickering gaslight cast Amelia Cartwright’s face in alternating shades of orange and shadow as she hunched over her ledger. Dust motes danced in the pale glow, swirling around the cramped room like miniature galaxies. The air was thick with the scent of stale ink, parchment, and pipe tobacco, a familiar aroma that usually soothed Amelia. Tonight, however, it did little to quell the gnawing anxiety twisting in her stomach.

It was tucked away from the boisterous bustle of London, yet still within earshot of the clattering hansom cabs and the hawkers’ cries echoing down the cobbled street. The setting sun cast long shadows across the windowpanes, hinting at the coming night and Amelia's daunting task: balancing the accounts for Mr. Blackwood's latest shipment before dawn broke.
