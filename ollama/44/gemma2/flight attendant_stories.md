The stale air hung heavy with the scent of recycled oxygen and lukewarm coffee as Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Thorne surveyed the cabin of Flight 347. Her eyes, framed by tired but vibrant green lashes, scanned the rows of slumped figures, their faces illuminated by the flickering glow of screens. It was a red-eye to Chicago, a journey usually filled with snoring business travelers and restless families, but tonight felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up Amy's spine, an almost imperceptible shift in the usual humdrum rhythm of air travel. 

The plane itself seemed to vibrate with a subtle energy, a low thrumming that echoed beneath the roar of the engines. Even the turbulence, usually a jarring reminder of the sky's capricious nature, felt oddly rhythmic, like a heartbeat pulsing through the metal fuselage.  Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. It wasn't an emergency, not yet, but there was a tension in the air, a silent anticipation that made the hairs on her neck stand on end.


This flight, she had a hunch, was about to become anything but ordinary.
