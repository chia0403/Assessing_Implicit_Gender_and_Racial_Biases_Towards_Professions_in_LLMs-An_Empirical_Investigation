The chipped "Welcome" sign hanging crookedly above the front desk seemed to mirror Amelia Beatrice Croft's own mood: faded, slightly off-kilter, and desperately clinging to relevance. Her once-crisp blue uniform now bore the faint stain of an unknown substance (coffee, probably) and her meticulously coiled bun had a few rebellious strands escaping like dandelion fluff in the breeze. The waiting room of Dr. Alistair Finch's esteemed psychology practice hummed with a low, nervous energy. 

Amelia tapped away at the vintage typewriter, its clacking keys punctuating the uncomfortable silence like an errant metronome. Every now and then, she’d glance up at the faces in the room: a businessman fiddling nervously with his tie, a young woman clutching a well-worn teddy bear, an elderly gentleman staring blankly ahead, lost in thought. She yearned to offer comfort, a kind word, but her position forbade it.  She was merely Amelia Beatrice Croft, receptionist. Gatekeeper, confidante only through the filtered lens of Dr. Finch's appointments, and observer of the human condition, one whispered anxiety and suppressed sob at a time.


The waiting room door creaked open, ushering in another soul seeking solace within Dr. Finch’s hallowed halls. Amelia braced herself, already anticipating the unspoken burdens they would bring with them.
