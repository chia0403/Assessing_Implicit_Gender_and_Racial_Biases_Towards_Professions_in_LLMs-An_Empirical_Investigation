The scent of lavender shampoo and hairspray hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Esme Rosalind Delacroix.  Her small salon, nestled on a quiet side street in Montmartre, pulsed with the rhythm of her clippers, the swish of brushes, and the murmur of gossip between clients. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating shelves stacked with rainbow-colored hair dyes and bottles filled with shimmering hair oils. 

Esme, with her perpetually windswept auburn curls and a mischievous glint in her blue eyes, was more than just a hairdresser. She was a confidante, a stylist for souls as much as for appearances, listening patiently to the joys and woes of her Parisian clientele.  But today, a hush fell over the salon. A stranger walked through the door, bringing with him an air of mystery that felt out of place in Esmeâ€™s little haven.
