The chandelier in the Grand Majestic Hotel lobby cast long, shimmering shadows across the polished marble floor. Eloise Cavendish adjusted her silk scarf, smoothing out the wrinkles with practiced grace. The scent of lilies and expensive perfume hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint hum of conversation from the elegantly dressed guests scattered around the opulent space. 

Eloise was used to it all. Ten years as head concierge at the Grand Majestic had instilled a calm efficiency within her, allowing her to navigate the whims and demands of the world's elite with unflappable poise. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, like an unseasonal chill in the heart of summer. 

It started with a late check-in. A man cloaked in shadows, arriving hours past his scheduled time, requesting a room on the highest floor, away from prying eyes. His voice was low and gravelly, his face obscured by the brim of a fedora. He paid in cash, crisp hundred dollar bills that felt strangely cold to Eloise's touch.
