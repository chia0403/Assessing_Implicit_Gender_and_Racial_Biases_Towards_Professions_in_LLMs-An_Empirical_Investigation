The scent of lavender and something vaguely chemical hung thick in the air of "Curl Up & Dye," a salon nestled between a laundromat and a perpetually-closed bookstore on Elm Street.  Sunlight, slanted by the afternoon hour, illuminated motes of dust dancing through the space, catching on the silver strands of Esmeralda "Esme" Dubois's meticulously coiffed hair. Esme stood behind her station, a vintage mahogany masterpiece with mirrored drawers that held a lifetime's worth of scissors and combs. Her hands, calloused but deft, expertly snipped away at a client's unruly curls, transforming them into cascading waves. 

But today, the usual buzz of clippers and hairdryer hum was punctuated by something else - an unsettling stillness. Esme felt it in the way her regulars fidgeted, their eyes darting towards the window more than usual. Even the cheerful chatter of Mrs. Henderson, a fixture for weekly perms, had been replaced by hushed whispers about the "happenings" downtown.
