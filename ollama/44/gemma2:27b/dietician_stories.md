The scent of cinnamon and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, white walls of Amelia Rose Cartwright's office. Outside her window, the vibrant chaos of New Orleans Mardi Gras pulsed - beads flying, music blaring, and laughter echoing down Bourbon Street. Inside, Amelia struggled to reconcile the joyful revelry with the woman sitting opposite her, slumped in defeat.

"I just want to enjoy myself," sighed Eloise Dubois, a petite woman with tired eyes and hands that constantly fidgeted with a silver crucifix necklace. "Every year, I tell myself I'll be good, but then the parades start, and the king cake beckons..." 


Amelia, her blonde braid swinging gently as she leaned forward, offered a warm smile. "Eloise," she began, her voice soothing like honeyed grits, "Mardi Gras is about celebration. We can find a way for you to enjoy it without derailing your progress."
