The humid air hung thick over Savannah, Georgia, clinging to Eleanor Rose Cartwright like a second skin as she navigated the cobblestone streets. The Spanish moss draped from ancient live oaks swayed lazily in the breeze, casting dancing shadows that seemed to mock her hurried pace.  Eleanor, with her fiery red curls escaping their usual bun and a smear of sweat on her brow, was late. Again.

Dr. Cartwright wasn't known for her punctuality, but she prided herself on her dedication to her patients. Her small practice, nestled in a charming Victorian house just off Forsyth Park, was a haven for those seeking relief from chronic pain.  Today, however, a rogue traffic light and an unexpected detour thanks to a parade celebrating the city's founding had thrown her schedule into disarray. 


Eleanor hurried up the steps of her porch, the scent of honeysuckle wafting from the overflowing planter boxes. A wave of guilt washed over her as she pictured Mrs. Henderson, patiently waiting in her treatment room, probably already stifling a sigh at Eleanor's tardiness.
