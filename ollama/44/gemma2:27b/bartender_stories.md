The neon glow of the 'Last Chance Saloon' sign buzzed faintly, casting an ethereal green hue across Elijah "Eli" Hawthorne's tired face. It was nearing 2 AM, the usual lull before the graveyard shift regulars shuffled in for their late-night solace. Eli sighed, wiping down the already spotless mahogany bar with a practiced hand. Outside, the desert wind howled like a banshee, whipping sand against the saloon doors and rattling the dusty windowpanes. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of whiskey, stale cigarette smoke, and something faintly metallic that Eli chose not to question.

He was used to this. Used to the weary faces seeking refuge from loneliness or heartbreak, used to the whispered secrets shared across the bar, used to the quiet symphony of clinking glasses and murmured conversations. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the surface of normalcy, a prickling unease that Eli couldn't quite place. As he poured himself a shot of bourbon – his own brand of late-night solace – the saloon door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and something far more ominous.
