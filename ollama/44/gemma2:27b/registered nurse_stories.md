Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Mercy General Hospital, blurring the already bleak cityscape beyond. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of disinfectant and an undercurrent of fear that only hospitals seemed to breed. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, RN, adjusted her mask, the familiar scent of antiseptic doing little to soothe the knot in her stomach. She'd been a nurse for ten years, but tonight felt different. A storm raged outside, mirroring the turmoil brewing within her. Tonight, she was on duty in the ER, facing down a wave of patients pouring in from a multi-car pileup on the rain-slicked freeway.

Amelia glanced at the triage board, already overflowing with names and color-coded labels denoting urgency. Red for critical, yellow for serious, green for stable. Her eyes snagged on a new entry - a young boy, no older than eight, listed as red. The name beneath it sent a shiver down her spine: Ethan Davies.
