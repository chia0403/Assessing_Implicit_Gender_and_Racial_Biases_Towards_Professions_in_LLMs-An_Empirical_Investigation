Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tumultuous emotions churning within his own chest. The scent of old books and brewing chamomile tea usually brought him comfort, but today, even the familiar aromas felt inadequate. His gaze drifted to the framed photograph on his desk: a younger, brighter-eyed Elias stood beside a woman with auburn hair and a smile that could light up a room – Amelia. Grief, sharp and insistent, pricked at him anew. It had been six months since she'd passed, leaving an emptiness in his life that no amount of professional insight or self-reflection seemed to mend.

A soft knock on the door startled him. "Come in," Elias said, forcing a semblance of composure onto his features as he straightened the framed photograph, tucking Amelia's smiling face out of sight. 


The door creaked open, revealing a young woman with nervous eyes and tightly clenched hands. This was it - his first session since Amelia’s passing. He took a deep breath, steeling himself for the emotional tightrope walk ahead.

"Hello," he said, offering a warm smile that felt strained even to him. "Please, come in. Have a seat."
