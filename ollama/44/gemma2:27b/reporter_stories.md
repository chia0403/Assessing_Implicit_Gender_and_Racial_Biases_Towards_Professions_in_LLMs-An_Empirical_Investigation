Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" karaoke bar across the street. Penelope "Penny" Albright, her trench coat dripping onto the threadbare carpet of her apartment, slammed the door shut with a thud that rattled the overflowing ashtrays on her desk. She lit a cigarette, the ember glowing like a defiant eye in the gloom. 

The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation – Penny's usual perfume these days. Three weeks she'd been chasing this story, digging through dusty police files and interviewing shifty informants in back alleys smelling of fish and regret. The disappearance of Anya Petrova, a young Russian ballerina who vanished without a trace from her apartment above the Lucky Dragon, was turning into a dead end. 

Penny stared at the grainy photograph on her desk – Anya's haunting smile frozen in time. Something didn’t add up.  The police were content to chalk it up as a runaway case, but Penny knew better. Anya had everything to lose and nothing to gain by leaving her burgeoning career behind.


There was something else too, a whisper of intrigue she couldn't quite grasp. A hidden message in the choreography of Anya's last performance? An anonymous phone call hinting at a secret admirer with dangerous intentions?  Penny stubbed out her cigarette, her eyes narrowing with determination. She wasn't giving up on Anya just yet. This story was too compelling to let go.
