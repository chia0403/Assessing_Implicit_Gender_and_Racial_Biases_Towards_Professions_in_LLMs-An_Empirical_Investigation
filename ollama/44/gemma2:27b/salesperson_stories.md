Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Harold "Hal" Montgomery's office, mimicking the relentless pounding in his chest.  The air hung thick with the metallic scent of stale coffee and desperation. Hal stared at the phone on his desk, its silence mocking him like a ticking time bomb. He hadn't closed a deal in weeks, his once-overflowing pipeline now drier than the Sahara. 

Outside, the neon glow of the "Used Cars Galore" sign flickered precariously, mirroring the precarious state of Hal's career.  He was on the verge of losing his job at this greasy lot on the outskirts of Phoenix, a place where dreams came to rust and optimism died in the searing desert sun.
