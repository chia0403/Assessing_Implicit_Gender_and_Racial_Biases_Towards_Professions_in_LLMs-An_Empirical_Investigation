The air conditioner wheezed like an asthmatic dragon, struggling to combat the July humidity that seeped through the cracks in Esmeralda "Esme" Delacroix's tiny office window. Travel posters plastered the walls â€“ a turquoise Bahamian beach beckoning next to a snow-capped Swiss Alps vista, their vibrant colors mocking Esme's current reality: stacks of brochures threatening to topple over, and an inbox overflowing with emails from disgruntled clients whose dream vacations had become pandemic nightmares.

Esme sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. She longed for the days when she could genuinely sell adventure and escape, instead of fielding calls about canceled flights and ever-changing travel restrictions. Still, she clung to hope, convinced that the wanderlust in people's hearts wouldn't be extinguished so easily.

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a visitor. Esme straightened her posture, plastering on her best customer service smile.  "Welcome to Voyages Extraordinaires!" she chirped. "How can I help you find your next adventure?"  The figure that stepped into the sunlight streaming through the window was unlike any client Esme had ever seen. Tall and cloaked in a heavy, burgundy velvet coat despite the sweltering heat, they held a weathered leather satchel tightly against their chest. Their face was hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat, casting a shadow over their features.

Esme's curiosity piqued. This wasn't just another traveler seeking a discounted cruise; there was something mysterious, almost otherworldly about this visitor.
