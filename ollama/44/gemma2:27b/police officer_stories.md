Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Elias Vance's office, each drop exploding in a miniature starburst against the already-streaked glass. The flickering neon sign from the pawn shop across the street cast an unsettling purple glow on the overflowing file boxes stacked precariously on his desk.  

Vance sighed, rubbing a hand over his weary face. A day that started with the promise of fresh coffee and catching up on paperwork had devolved into another dead end in the string of petty thefts plaguing the city's historic district. The victims, all elderly residents known for their antique collections, were reporting missing items – a silver locket here, a porcelain doll there – things seemingly insignificant in value but deeply sentimental.

The phone on his desk buzzed insistently, shattering the oppressive silence. Vance braced himself. He knew it wouldn't be good news.

“Vance,” he barked into the receiver, already dreading what he would hear.
