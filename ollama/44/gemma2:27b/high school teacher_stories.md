The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Ms. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's classroom. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and adolescent angst, a familiar cocktail Ellie had come to associate with her Friday afternoon AP Literature class. Outside, autumn leaves danced in the wind, painting the world in fiery hues, but inside, the mood was decidedly less festive. 

Ellie perched on the edge of her desk, watching her students shuffle through their copies of "Wuthering Heights." Emily BrontÃ«'s bleak masterpiece wasn't exactly known for its lightheartedness, and Ellie could sense the collective groan emanating from her class. She knew they were itching to be free for the weekend, just as she was. But there was still a half hour left on the clock, and Ellie was determined to squeeze every ounce of intellectual juice out of it before letting them loose.

The bell above the door clanged harshly, signaling the end of the previous class. A moment later, Ethan Miller swaggered in, his signature smirk plastered across his face. Ethan, the star quarterback with a penchant for challenging authority and skipping homework assignments, was Ellie's perpetual thorn in her side. He slumped into his seat at the back, deliberately ignoring her pointed gaze. Today, Ellie decided, she wouldn't let him get away with it.
