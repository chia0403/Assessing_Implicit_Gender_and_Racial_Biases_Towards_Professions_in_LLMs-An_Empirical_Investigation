The air hung thick with static, both literally and figuratively, as Elias "Eli" Hawthorne tightened the last screw on the battered transistor radio. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly on his ramshackle workshop – a converted chicken coop behind his grandmother's house. Dust motes danced in the single ray of sunlight piercing through the grimy windowpane, illuminating Eli's grease-stained fingers and the tangled mess of wires snaking across his workbench.

Eli wasn't just fixing radios; he was resurrecting them. Giving voice to forgotten stories whispered through crackling speakers. Each hum and pop held a history, a connection to a bygone era that fascinated him. Today's patient was a 1940s Philco, its wooden case scarred and faded, but its innards still humming with potential.  Eli imagined the voices it had carried – news of war, whispers of love, the crackle of laughter around a crackling fire. He longed to hear them again, to bridge the gap between then and now. 

But as he reached for the soldering iron, a sharp rap on the coop door startled him. Eli's heart skipped a beat. Visitors were rare in this dusty corner of the world. Who could it be?
