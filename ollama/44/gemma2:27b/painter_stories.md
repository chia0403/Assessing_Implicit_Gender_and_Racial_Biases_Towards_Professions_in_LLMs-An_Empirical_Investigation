Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the grime-coated glass. Elara Finch squinted at the canvas before her, frustration tightening her jaw. The vibrant colours she'd envisioned for the sunrise scene refused to materialize on the rough canvas, instead looking dull and lifeless under the dim bulb hanging from the rafters. 

Elara lived in a converted attic above a bustling bakery in Edinburgh’s Old Town. The aroma of fresh bread and cinnamon often wafted up through the floorboards, a tantalizing contrast to the musty scent of paint and turpentine that permeated her small studio. It was a space crammed with canvases leaning against every wall, tubes of paint spilling from overflowing boxes, and brushes haphazardly piled in chipped mugs.

Despite its cramped nature, Elara loved her attic sanctuary. The slanted rooflines and exposed beams gave it an air of quirky charm, while the view from the dormer window – overlooking the rooftops and cobblestone streets below – provided endless inspiration. But today, even the charming vista couldn't penetrate the fog of frustration clouding her mind.
