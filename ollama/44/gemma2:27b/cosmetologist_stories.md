Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Shear Perfection," the rhythmic drumming punctuated by occasional booms of thunder. Inside, Emilia Rosalie DeLuca sighed, idly twirling a lock of fiery red hair between her fingers. The salon was empty, the usual bustling energy replaced by an eerie quietude. 

Emilia loved rainy days, usually. They offered a chance to catch up on administrative tasks, experiment with new styles on mannequins, or simply indulge in a good book while sipping strong coffee. But today, the incessant rain felt oppressive, mirroring the storm brewing within her. Her latest client, Mrs. Hawthorne, had been particularly demanding, insisting on a shade of blonde Emilia swore didn't exist outside of Photoshop. The woman had stormed out, muttering about "incompetence" and threatening to leave scathing reviews online. 


Emilia glanced at the clock - 4:30 pm. Closing time was in half an hour, and she hadn't had a single walk-in all day.  A wave of doubt washed over her. Was she truly cut out for this? Should she have listened to her father and pursued a "stable" career like accounting?

Just then, the bell above the door chimed, breaking the silence. A figure stepped in, shrouded in rain and shadows. Emilia straightened, steeling herself for another potential customer service nightmare. She took a deep breath and plastered on her brightest smile. 

"Welcome to Shear Perfection! How can I help you?" she chirped, hoping her voice didn't betray the exhaustion creeping into her bones.  The figure moved closer, revealing a woman with piercing blue eyes and hair the colour of twilight, wet and clinging to her thin frame. She looked at Emilia with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine.

"My name is Seraphina," the woman said in a voice like velvet. "And I need your help."
