Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Earl Montgomery's beat-up pickup truck, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign at Gus's Diner. Earl chewed on a thumbnail, his calloused fingers drumming nervously on the steering wheel. He hadn't intended to be driving through this desolate stretch of Nevada highway at midnight, but a blown transformer in the middle of nowhere had other plans.

Earl, with his salt-and-pepper beard and perpetually grease-stained overalls, wasn't exactly built for glamour. His world was one of tangled wires, flickering lights, and the comforting hum of electricity coursing through properly installed circuits. But tonight, even he felt a shiver of unease as the wind howled like a banshee around him. The diner, its lone beacon in the storm-tossed desert, seemed to beckon with an unsettling promise of warmth and refuge.
