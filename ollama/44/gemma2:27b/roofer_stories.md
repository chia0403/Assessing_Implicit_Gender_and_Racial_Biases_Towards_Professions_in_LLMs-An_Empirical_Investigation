The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck, turning his already sweat-soaked collar into a steaming rag. He balanced precariously on the ridgeline of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian mansion, three stories above the manicured lawn. A gust of wind rattled loose shingles and sent shivers down Eli's spine, threatening to undo his carefully cultivated calm. Below him, the quaint town of Oakhaven bustled with its usual midday hum – children's laughter, the rhythmic clanging of the blacksmith's hammer, and the distant rumble of a Model T chugging up Main Street.

Eli inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar scent of cedar shingles warming under the summer sun. Despite the treacherous position, he felt a sense of peace amidst the chaos. This was his sanctuary – high above the world, where only the wind and the cries of gulls reached him. Up here, Eli wasn't just a roofer; he was an artist, meticulously crafting protection from the elements with each hammer blow and shingle placement. 

Today, however, something felt off. The air hummed with an unseen energy, making the hairs on his neck prickle. Eli glanced down at the street below, searching for the source of this unease, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change – and not necessarily for the better.
