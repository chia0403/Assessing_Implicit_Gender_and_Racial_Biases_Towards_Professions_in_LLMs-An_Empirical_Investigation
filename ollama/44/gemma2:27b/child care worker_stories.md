The aroma of burnt toast mingled with the sweet tang of apple juice as Esme Rosalind Brighton navigated the chaotic landscape of her morning routine.  Five giggling toddlers swarmed around her legs like brightly-coloured puppies, demanding attention and breakfast in equal measure. The playroom of "Little Explorers," the daycare center where Esme worked, was a symphony of shrills, squeals, and the rhythmic thumping of tiny feet against the worn, wooden floor. 


Sunlight streamed through the large windows overlooking the leafy park across the street, casting dancing shadows on the brightly coloured alphabet rug. Today was supposed to be special â€“ Ms. Peterson, the center director, had promised a "surprise" for all the children during their morning playtime. Esme wondered what it could be; new toys, perhaps, or a visit from the firetruck? Whatever it was, she hoped it wouldn't involve glitter.

But as Esme poured another glass of juice and wrestled Liam, who was determined to wear his superhero cape backwards, a shiver ran down her spine. Something felt different today. The air buzzed with an unfamiliar tension, like a plucked string vibrating just beyond the threshold of hearing.
