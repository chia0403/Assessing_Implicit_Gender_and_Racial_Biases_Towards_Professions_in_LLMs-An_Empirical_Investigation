The aroma of jasmine tea hung heavy in the air, mingling with the antiseptic tang that permeated St. Jude’s Rehabilitation Center. Elara Blackwood adjusted her spectacles, peering intently at the tangle of wires and tubes connected to the elderly woman lying on the bed. Mrs. Eleanor Davies, a retired librarian who'd suffered a debilitating stroke, stared blankly ahead, her right side limp and unresponsive.

Elara, with her unruly auburn curls escaping their braid and eyes the color of moss after a spring rain, felt a familiar surge of determination.  This was why she'd chosen occupational therapy – to help people like Mrs. Davies reclaim their lives, piece by fragile piece. St. Jude’s, nestled amidst the rolling green hills of Vermont, was her sanctuary. 

But today, a sense of unease gnawed at Elara. The hushed whispers of nurses in the hallway, the worried glances exchanged between doctors – something felt amiss.  And then there was the new patient, wheeled into Room 203 just before Elara's shift began. A young man, barely conscious, with eyes that held a haunting emptiness and bandages covering most of his face. The mystery surrounding him deepened the unsettling feeling in Elara’s gut.
