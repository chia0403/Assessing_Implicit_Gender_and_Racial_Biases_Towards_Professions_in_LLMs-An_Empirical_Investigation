The scent of sawdust and pine needles hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Thaddeus Blackwood. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of his workshop, illuminating motes dancing in its golden rays. Outside, the wind whipped through the ancient oaks lining the dirt road, their leaves rustling like whispered secrets. 

Elias ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of a half-finished cherrywood table. He squinted, inspecting the grain for imperfections. This piece was destined for Mrs. Hawthorne's parlor, and he wouldn't settle for anything less than perfection.  The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer echoed through the silent workshop, punctuated by the occasional scrape of sandpaper against wood. Elias worked with a quiet focus, his mind adrift in a world of angles and curves, where each piece fit seamlessly together to create something beautiful and lasting. 

But today, even the familiar solace of his craft couldn't quite soothe the unease gnawing at him. The rumors swirling through their small Appalachian town were too persistent to ignore: whispers of strange lights in the woods, unexplained animal deaths, and a growing sense that something wasnâ€™t right. Elias, a man who believed in the tangible world of wood and nails, found himself questioning his own convictions. 

Something was amiss in Blackwood Hollow, and Elias knew he couldn't just stand by and watch. He had to find out what was happening.
