Rain lashed against the windowpane of Eleanor "Ellie" Davenport's cramped office, each drop a tiny hammer blow against her already fraying nerves. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, mirroring the anxiety that thrummed in Ellie's chest. April 15th, the annual tax deadline, loomed like a monstrous kraken, its tentacles threatening to drag her and her clients into an abyss of missed deadlines and hefty penalties.

Ellie's office, nestled above a dusty bookstore on Elm Street, was hardly conducive to serenity. Stacks of W-2s and 1099s teetered precariously on every available surface. Coffee mugs stained with the ghosts of forgotten deadlines littered the desk. Even the air seemed thick with the scent of anxiety and stale coffee, a potent cocktail Ellie had come to associate with this time of year.
