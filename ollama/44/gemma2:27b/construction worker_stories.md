The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Callahan's neck as he wrestled a length of rebar into place. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the lines of the half-built skyscraper stretching towards the cloudless Arizona sky. The air thrummed with the symphony of construction: clanking metal, whirring drills, shouts muffled by hard hats. Eli tightened the last bolt on the rebar cage, a sense of satisfaction blooming in his chest despite the heat and grime. He loved this work - the physicality, the tangible results, the feeling of building something monumental from the ground up. 

Today, however, was different. A nervous energy crackled beneath Eli's skin. The foreman, a gruff man named Gus, had called him into his office earlier that morning, his face unusually grim. Something about the project, he'd said, something "off." Eli hadn't pressed for details - Gus wasn't one for idle chit-chat - but the unease lingered. As Eli hoisted another rebar section, a shiver ran down his spine. He couldn't shake the feeling that this towering monument to steel and concrete held more than just blueprints and ambition.  There was something else here, lurking in the shadows cast by its incomplete form.
