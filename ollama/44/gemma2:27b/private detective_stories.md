Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof above Elias Finch's office like a thousand tiny fists. The streetlights outside cast sickly yellow glows that barely pierced the gloom clinging to the alleyway. Inside, Finch sat hunched over his desk, a crumpled cigarette dangling from his lips, the ember glowing ominously in the dim light. His office smelled of stale coffee, cheap whiskey, and regret â€“ a scent familiar to most private eyes in this part of town. 

Finch had seen it all: cheating spouses, missing persons, stolen jewels, even the occasional blackmail scheme. But the case that lay on his desk now was different. A woman with emerald green eyes and hair the color of raven's wings had walked in earlier that day, her face etched with worry. Her name was Seraphina Beaumont, and she needed Finch to find her missing brother, a renowned archaeologist who had vanished without a trace while excavating an ancient Mayan temple deep in the jungles of Belize.
