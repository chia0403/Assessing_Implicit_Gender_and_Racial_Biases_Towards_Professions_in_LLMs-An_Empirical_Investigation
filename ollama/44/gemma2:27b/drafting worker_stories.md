Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the draftsman's shack, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of the storm.  Inside, Elias Finch hunched over his drawing board, the single flickering gas lamp casting long shadows that danced across the worn wooden floor. The air smelled faintly of oil and stale ink, a comforting aroma Elias had come to associate with both work and solace. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, but within the confines of his cramped workspace, Elias was transported to another world – one he built stroke by stroke on the crisp vellum paper before him.

He wasn't drafting grand cathedrals or sweeping cityscapes like some of his more prestigious colleagues in the metropolis. Elias’ work was humbler, yet no less vital: intricate blueprints for farming machinery, precise schematics for irrigation systems, and detailed plans for sturdy grain silos that dotted the vast, rolling plains surrounding their small town of Dustbowl Creek. He took pride in his contribution to the community, knowing that each line he drew helped sustain the livelihoods of the hardworking farmers who were the backbone of this arid land.

Today, however, Elias wasn’t feeling his usual sense of purpose.  The relentless storm mirrored a growing unease within him. A letter had arrived earlier that day, bearing the official seal of the Royal Engineering Society – an invitation to join their ranks in the bustling capital city. It was an opportunity he had dreamed of since childhood, a chance to test his skills against the best draftsmen in the land and leave his mark on grander projects. Yet, as Elias stared at the faded ink on the vellum before him, he felt a pang of doubt. Could he truly abandon Dustbowl Creek, the place he’d called home for all his twenty-six years?
