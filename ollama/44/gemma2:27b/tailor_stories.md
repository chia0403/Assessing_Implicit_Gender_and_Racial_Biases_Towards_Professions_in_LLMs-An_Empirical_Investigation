The pungent aroma of beeswax and singed thread hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender drifting from Elara Thorne's embroidery basket. Outside her shop window, cobblestone streets bustled with the usual morning chaos of Port Azure – fishmongers hawking their wares, children chasing stray cats through market stalls, and sailors swaggering back to their ships after a night ashore.  

But within Elara's tiny atelier, tucked away on a quiet side street, time seemed to move at a slower pace. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpane, illuminating spools of silk thread in vibrant hues and bolts of velvet shimmering like moonlit water. Elara, her silver hair pulled back in a neat bun, meticulously adjusted the fit of a doublet for a portly merchant, her nimble fingers dancing across the fabric with practiced ease.  

Today was different though. A hush had fallen over Elara's usually bustling heart. An unexpected letter lay on her workbench, its seal bearing the unfamiliar crest of House Valerian. The Valerian family – wealthy and powerful merchants who controlled Port Azure's trade routes – rarely sought out a humble tailor like herself.  Elara traced the elegant calligraphy with a trembling finger, a knot forming in her stomach. What could they possibly want?
