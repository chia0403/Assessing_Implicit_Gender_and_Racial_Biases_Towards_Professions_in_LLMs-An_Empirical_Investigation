The Arizona sun beat down on Jasper "Jazz" Calloway's rig like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his chrome bumper into a searing beacon. Dust devils danced across the endless expanse of highway, mocking Jazz with their carefree pirouettes. He squinted at the horizon, searching for any sign of civilization, anything to break the monotony of asphalt and sand. His CB radio crackled, spitting out static and the occasional unintelligible mumble from some other soul braving this desolate stretch.

Jazz sighed, drumming his fingers on the worn leather steering wheel. This haul - a load of steel beams headed from Phoenix to Las Vegas - had been a last-minute job, promising good pay but delivering little else in terms of excitement. He'd been on the road for three days straight, fueled by lukewarm coffee and greasy diner food, his only companions the ghosts of truckers past who haunted these highways.
