The stale air conditioning hummed above Emilia Rose Beaumont's head, its mechanical whirring mirroring the anxious thrumming in her chest. Outside the tiny galley window, storm clouds churned like a bruised sky, mirroring the turbulence that had gripped Flight 472 for the past hour.  

Emilia adjusted her perfectly coiffed bun and smoothed down the wrinkles in her crisp, navy uniform. Her smile, usually as bright as the airline's logo, felt strained. The passengers were starting to fidget â€“ the occasional nervous cough echoing through the cabin, a child's whimpers escalating into full-blown sobs. She needed to project calm, even though inside she was battling a rising tide of apprehension herself.  This wasn't just any storm; this was the kind that spawned legends, the kind that made seasoned pilots mutter under their breath and reach for extra rosary beads. 


Emilia took a deep breath, channeling her inner Amelia Earhart. She straightened her shoulders, grabbed a tray laden with miniature pretzels and juice boxes, and pushed open the galley door, ready to face the storm, both inside the plane and out.
