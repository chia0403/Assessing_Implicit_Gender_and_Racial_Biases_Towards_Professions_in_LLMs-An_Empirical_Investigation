The frigid wind whipped across the obsidian plains, biting at Elara Stormborn's exposed cheeks. She pulled her woolen cowl tighter, its familiar scent of woodsmoke and lavender offering scant comfort against the relentless chill. Above, the twin moons hung heavy in the sky, casting long, skeletal shadows from the jagged peaks that ringed the desolate wasteland.

Elara gripped the haft of her spear, its obsidian head glinting ominously in the pale moonlight. Her gaze swept across the desolate landscape, searching for any sign of movement.  As a guard for the Citadel of Whispering Winds, she was tasked with protecting the ancient city from the horrors that lurked beyond the protective wards.

Tonight, the wind carried whispers of something unnatural â€“ a low growl, barely audible over the howling gale. Elara's heart pounded in her chest. She had heard tales of creatures that prowled the obsidian plains, feeding on fear and despair.  Could this be one of them?
