Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the abandoned warehouse, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside Elias Finch, Systems Analyst extraordinaire.  The cavernous space was dimly lit by flickering fluorescent bulbs hanging precariously from rusted chains. Stacks of dusty crates and forgotten machinery loomed in the shadows, lending an air of eerie stillness to the constant drumming of the downpour. Elias, hunched over a makeshift workbench cobbled together from scrap metal and plywood, tapped furiously on his battered laptop. Lines of code scrolled across the screen, reflecting the frantic energy coursing through him.

Tonight was different. Tonight, he wasn't working on optimizing data flows for some faceless corporation. Tonight, Elias was on the hunt for something far more elusive â€“ a ghost in the machine.
