The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Ms. Eloise Ainsworth’s third-grade classroom, painting long stripes across the worn linoleum floor. A symphony of cicadas thrummed outside, their incessant song blending with the murmur of last-minute lesson reviews and the rhythmic tapping of pencils against desks.  Eloise leaned against her desk, a mountain of ungraded papers threatening to topple over beside her.  She closed her eyes for a moment, savoring the familiar scent of crayons and chalk that clung to the air. It was a smell she'd come to associate with both chaos and calm, a potent reminder of the whirlwind adventure she embarked on every day.

But today, something felt different. A restless energy thrummed beneath the surface of the usual classroom buzz. Eloise couldn’t shake the feeling that something unexpected was about to happen.
