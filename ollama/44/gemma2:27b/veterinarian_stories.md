Rain lashed against the windows of "Critter Comfort," blurring the neon sign into an indistinct smear of pink and green. Inside, Dr. Amelia Rosalind Thorne wrestled with a particularly recalcitrant Maine Coon named Bartholomew. He'd arrived that morning with a suspected urinary tract infection, but Bartholomew, true to his breed's stoic reputation, was determined to make Amelia earn every milliliter of urine she needed for analysis.

"Come on, Bart," Amelia coaxed, her voice soothing despite the twitch in her left eye. "Just a little bit. For your own good, I promise." Bartholomew glared at her with emerald eyes, his tufted ears flattened against his head. The scent of antiseptic mingled with wet fur and feline disdain filled the examination room, adding to the already tense atmosphere.

The incessant drumming of rain outside mirrored the anxiety rising in Amelia's chest. It had been a long day, starting with a frantic rescue of a litter of abandoned kittens and culminating in this standoff with Bartholomew. All she wanted was to go home, change into something dry, and curl up with a good book and a cup of chamomile tea. But first, she needed to conquer this furry fortress of defiance.
