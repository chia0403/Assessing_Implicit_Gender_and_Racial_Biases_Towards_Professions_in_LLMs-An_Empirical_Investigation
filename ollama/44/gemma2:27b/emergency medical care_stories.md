The rain hammered against the ambulance windows, blurring the already fading streetlights into shimmering orbs. Inside, Elias Thorne, his salt-and-pepper hair plastered to his forehead, wrestled with a stubborn IV line. The patient, a young woman named Maria, groaned softly, her face pale and clammy despite the heater blasting warm air.

Elias had been an EMT for over fifteen years, seen enough blood and broken bones to last several lifetimes. Yet, there was still something about the frantic energy of a call that sent adrenaline surging through his veins.  Tonight, though, the urgency felt different. Maria's shallow breaths and the insistent, rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor painted a picture Elias didn't want to see â€“ one where time ran out before they reached the hospital.

He glanced at his partner, Sarah, a rookie barely out of training, whose eyes reflected the flickering red lights outside. She was quiet, focused on monitoring Maria's vitals, but Elias knew she was feeling the pressure just as acutely as he was. This wasn't some routine fender bender; this was life and death hanging precariously in the balance.
