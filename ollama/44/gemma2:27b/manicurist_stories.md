The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender, a familiar perfume that usually calmed Eloise Bellefleur. Today, however, the sweet, chemical tang only heightened her anxiety.  Eloise glanced nervously at the clock ticking on the wall of "Nails by Eloise," its rhythmic clicks mirroring the frantic beating of her heart. It was 2:57 pm. Madame Dubois, her most demanding client and biggest influencer on Instagram, was due any minute. Eloise's hands trembled slightly as she surveyed her workstation. Every tool was perfectly aligned, every polish bottle gleaming under the warm salon lights. Yet, a cold sweat prickled at her temples. 

Today wasn't just about crafting the perfect French manicure for Madame Dubois' upcoming gala. Today was Eloise Bellefleur's chance to prove herself â€“ not just as a manicurist, but as an artist.  Madame Dubois had challenged her: create a design inspired by the upcoming meteor shower, something "celestial and captivating." Eloise had poured over astronomy books, sketched intricate constellations, and even spent hours mixing custom glitter polishes to mimic the shimmer of starlight. But could she pull it off? Could she capture the fleeting beauty of a celestial event on Madame Dubois' petite fingernails?  


The salon door chimed, shattering the tense silence. Eloise took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and forced a confident smile.

"Madame Dubois," she chirped, "Welcome! I'm so glad you're here."
