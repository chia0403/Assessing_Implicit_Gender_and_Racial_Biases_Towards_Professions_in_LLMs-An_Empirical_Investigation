Dust devils danced across the parched Arizona landscape, twisting and twirling like miniature tornadoes against the backdrop of a merciless sun.  The air hung heavy and still, punctuated only by the distant, mournful cry of a hawk circling overhead. Caleb "Cal" McAlister squinted at the horizon, his weathered face creased with concern. The creek that snaked through his sprawling cattle ranch, normally a gurgling lifeline for his herd, had dwindled to a sluggish trickle.

This drought was unlike anything Cal had seen in his sixty years on this land.  Heâ€™d wrestled steer, mended fences, and battled blizzards, but the relentless grip of the sun seemed an insurmountable foe. His calloused hands tightened around the worn handle of his water bucket as he trudged towards the thirsty herd, their mournful lowing a constant reminder of the dire situation.
