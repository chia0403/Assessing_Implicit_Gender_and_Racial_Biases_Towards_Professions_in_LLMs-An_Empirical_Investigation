The Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Cartwright's weathered neck like a blacksmith's hammer.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt miles ahead, mocking Eli as he surveyed the endless stretch of highway 95. It snaked through the desolate expanse, a lonely black ribbon against the burnt orange landscape.  

Eli squinted at the shimmering horizon. Nothing but scrub brush and the occasional gnarled Joshua tree broke the monotony. His work truck sat idling beside him, its engine sighing like a weary beast. The radio was tuned to static, a fitting soundtrack for this forgotten corner of the world. Today's task: patching a section of pavement riddled with potholes, courtesy of last winter's brutal freeze-thaw cycle. Eli sighed, hefting his tool bag onto his shoulder. It was just another day on the lonely road, but today felt different. A prickle of unease danced along his spine, a feeling that something wasn't quite right.
