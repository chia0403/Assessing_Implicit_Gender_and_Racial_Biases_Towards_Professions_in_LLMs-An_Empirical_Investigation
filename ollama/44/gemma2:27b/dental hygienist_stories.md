The whirring of the drill was a lullaby Beatrice "Bee" Alcott knew by heart.  It sang through the sterile white walls of Dr. Ramirez's practice, mingling with the faint scent of antiseptic and peppermint toothpaste. Bee perched on her stool, meticulously polishing Mr. Henderson's incisors, her practiced touch light as a butterfly's wing. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly, turning Phoenix into a shimmering mirage. But inside, the air conditioning hummed a cool counterpoint, creating a sanctuary of calm efficiency. 

Today, however, Bee couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A prickle of unease danced along her spine, making her acutely aware of the weight of the dental mirror in her hand. It wasn't Mr. Henderson - he was a regular, as predictable as his fondness for butterscotch candy. No, it was something else, a whisper of discordance she couldn't quite place.
