The rusty gate groaned like an old man complaining about his bones as Thaddeus Bartholomew Quince, groundskeeper extraordinaire, pushed it open. Morning mist clung to the ancient oaks lining the driveway of Blackwood Manor, their branches heavy with dew that shimmered like scattered diamonds. The air held the crisp scent of autumn leaves and damp earth, a fragrance Thaddeus found comforting and familiar.

Blackwood Manor, a sprawling gothic edifice perched atop a windswept hill, had been his domain for the past twenty years. He knew every nook and cranny, every whispering breeze through the willows, every creak of the ancient stone steps leading up to the imposing front door. But today felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Thaddeus' spine, a feeling he couldn't shake off as he surveyed the overgrown rose garden, its once vibrant blooms now withered and brown. Something was amiss in his sanctuary, something unseen but deeply unsettling.
