The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile, pale glow on the linoleum floor of Mercy General's draw station. Amelia "Amy" Nguyen tapped her pen against the clipboard, a rhythm that mirrored the nervous flutter in her stomach.  Today was different. Today wasn't just another routine blood draw. Today, Amy was responsible for collecting samples from the hospital's newest patient - a renowned archaeologist who had been flown in from a remote dig site after suffering a mysterious illness.

The air in the draw station, usually thick with the scent of antiseptic and anxiety, now held a tinge of something else – intrigue. Rumors about the archaeologist, Dr. Eleanor Vance, swirled through the hallways like dust motes in the afternoon sun. Whispers spoke of ancient curses, lost civilizations, and artifacts that could rewrite history. 

Amy felt a shiver crawl up her spine. She’d always been drawn to history, devouring documentaries and books on forgotten empires. The chance to be even tangentially involved with someone who unearthed those secrets was exhilarating, if slightly unnerving.  


As the door creaked open, Amy straightened her lab coat and plastered on her most professional smile. Dr. Vance, shrouded in a hospital gown and an air of quiet dignity, entered the room. Her eyes, despite their weariness, sparkled with intelligence. 

Amy's pulse quickened. This wasn't just another patient; this was a chance to touch history.
