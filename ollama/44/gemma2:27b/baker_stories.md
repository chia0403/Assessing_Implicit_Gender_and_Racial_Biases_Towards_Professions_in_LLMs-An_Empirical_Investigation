The aroma of toasted almonds and cinnamon swirled through the cobblestone alley, a fragrant beacon in the pre-dawn chill of Paris. Elodie Marchand hummed along to Edith Piaf crooning from a tinny radio perched on a flour sack, her hands expertly kneading dough that pulsed beneath her touch. The small bakery, "Le Petit DÃ©lice," was Elodie's sanctuary, its worn wooden counters and flour-dusted windows whispering stories of generations past. Today, however, the air crackled with an unusual tension. A letter lay open on the counter, its contents unsettling Elodie like a sudden gust of wind. It was from her estranged aunt, Marie, begging for Elodie's help.

Now, she needed Elodie, and Elodie, despite her apprehension, knew she couldn't ignore the plea from the only family she had left.
