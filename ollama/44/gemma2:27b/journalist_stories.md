Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's cramped apartment, mimicking the tempest brewing in her chest. A crumpled rejection letter lay on the coffee table, its stark words mocking her ambition: "We regret to inform you…"

It was the fifth one this month. Five publications had turned down her exposé on the shadowy dealings of the Onyx Corporation, a tech giant rumored to be manipulating algorithms for profit. Amy knew she had solid leads – leaked internal documents, hushed whispers from disgruntled employees – but no one seemed willing to touch the story. 

Fear, she realized, was the culprit. Onyx's tentacles reached far and wide, its influence weaving through media outlets like a spider's web. To challenge them was to invite retribution, something Amy, with her meager savings and precarious freelance status, couldn't afford.

But the thought of burying such an explosive story gnawed at her conscience. Amy believed in truth, even if it came cloaked in shadows. She needed a way in, someone who could help her expose Onyx without putting herself in danger. And she knew just where to look: the underground hacker collective known as "The Ghosts."  They were rumored to be experts in data extraction and digital subterfuge, capable of navigating the darkest corners of the internet with unmatched skill.

Amy grabbed her battered laptop, its keys worn smooth from years of relentless typing. The rain continued its relentless assault, but Amy felt a flicker of hope ignite within her. She was prepared to take a risk.
