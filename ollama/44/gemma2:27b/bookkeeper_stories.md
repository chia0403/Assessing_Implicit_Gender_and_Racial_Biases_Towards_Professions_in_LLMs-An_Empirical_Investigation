Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Henderson & Sons Accounting, mirroring the storm brewing inside Elias Finchley. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Stacks of invoices teetered precariously on his desk, each one a testament to the failing bakery next door. 

Elias, with his perpetually ink-stained fingers and horn-rimmed spectacles perched precariously on his nose, was not a man for emotional outbursts. Yet, staring at the dwindling balance in Mrs. Henderson's ledger, he felt a knot of anxiety tighten in his chest. For years, Elias had diligently tracked every penny, ensuring the stability of Henderson & Sons. But now, faced with the bakery's imminent closure and the ripple effect it would have on their business, he felt powerless.

He sighed, pushing away the stack of invoices. The rhythmic clatter of rain against the windowpane seemed to mock his helplessness. Elias needed a solution, and fast.  But where could he possibly find one?
