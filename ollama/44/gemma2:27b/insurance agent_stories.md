Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Harold Tiberius Finch's office, mimicking the relentless drumbeat in his chest. The air hung thick with the smell of damp paper and desperation, both emanating from the pile of unpaid claims precariously balanced on his desk.

Harold wasn't your typical insurance agent. He hadn't climbed the corporate ladder fueled by ambition and a ruthless pursuit of profit. Instead, he’d stumbled into the industry after inheriting his grandfather's struggling agency, Finch & Sons Insurance, a relic from a time when handshake deals and personal connections mattered more than quarterly reports.

Harold’s cramped office on the second floor of a dilapidated building in downtown Bellhaven reflected the state of his business: faded floral wallpaper peeling at the seams, a rickety desk creaking under the weight of paperwork, and a phone that seemed perpetually stuck on “ring.” Today, however, the persistent ringing held a different urgency. It was Mrs. Peabody again, her voice trembling as she recounted another leak in her aging roof. Harold knew it was beyond repair, yet he couldn’t bear to tell her. Not today.
