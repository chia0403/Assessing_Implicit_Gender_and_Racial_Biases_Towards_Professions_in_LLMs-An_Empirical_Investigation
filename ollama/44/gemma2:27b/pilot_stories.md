The rusty air brakes hissed like an exasperated serpent as Eleanor "Ellie" Vance eased the ancient Cessna 172 to a halt on the cracked tarmac. Dust devils danced across the desolate airstrip, swirling crimson against the endless backdrop of Nevada desert. The sun beat down with relentless fury, baking the metal fuselage and sending shimmering waves of heat rising from the ground. Ellie unbuckled her harness, wincing as she felt the familiar ache in her lower back - a souvenir from years spent wrestling this temperamental aircraft through turbulent skies. 

This wasn't exactly the glamorous life she'd envisioned when she was a wide-eyed cadet at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. But after a string of bad luck and even worse decisions, Ellie had found herself grounded in more ways than one.  Delivering supplies to remote mining outposts in the unforgiving Nevada wasteland wasn't exactly what she'd dreamed of, but it paid the bills and kept her flying â€“ for now.
