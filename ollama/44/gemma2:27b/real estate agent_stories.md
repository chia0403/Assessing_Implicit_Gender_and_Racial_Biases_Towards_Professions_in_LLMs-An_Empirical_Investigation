Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already fading twilight into an Impressionist painting of greys and blues. Eliza Bethany Cartwright gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. She hated driving in this weather; it always felt like the city itself was conspiring against her.

Eliza pulled up to a dilapidated Victorian mansion perched precariously on a hill overlooking the harbour. The house looked like something out of a gothic novel - ivy clawed at the peeling paint, and broken windows stared down like empty sockets. A chill wind whistled through the skeletal branches of an ancient oak tree, casting grotesque shadows across the overgrown lawn.

This was her latest listing: Blackwood Manor, a property steeped in rumour and whispered legends. Eliza wasn't sure what she'd expected, but this crumbling monument to forgotten grandeur was far more unsettling than any online photograph could convey.
