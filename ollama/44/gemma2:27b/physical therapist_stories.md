Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane, blurring the already-faded sign outside: "Seahaven Physical Therapy - Helping You Move Forward."

It was Tuesday, typically their busiest day, yet the storm had kept everyone huddled indoors.

Seahaven wasn't much to look at - a cramped office above Mrs. O’Malley’s bakery, with peeling paint and threadbare carpet – but Elara poured her heart into it. This small coastal town was her home, and she believed everyone deserved access to quality care, regardless of their ability to pay.  Today, however, even the loyalty of her regulars seemed dampened by the relentless downpour.

Just as a flicker of disappointment threatened to consume her, the bell above the door jingled, announcing an unexpected arrival.
