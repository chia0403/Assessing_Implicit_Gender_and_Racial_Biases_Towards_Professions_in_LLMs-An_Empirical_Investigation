The rhythmic hum of the Boeing 747’s engines was like a lullaby to Amelia Rose Carter.  She adjusted her headset, checking the intercom before addressing the passengers in her smooth, practiced voice. "Good evening ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard Flight 387 to Bangkok. Please make sure your seatbelts are fastened and that all carry-on luggage is stowed safely."

Amelia was a veteran flight attendant with Air Zenith, having spent the last decade navigating turbulent skies and even stormier passengers. The air inside the cabin thrummed with the energy of anticipation – honeymooners whispered to each other, business executives tapped away at laptops, and families fidgeted, excited for their destination. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the tarmac as they taxied towards the runway. Amelia glanced out the window, watching the cityscape shrink behind them.  It was a familiar sight – another adventure about to unfold in the vast canvas of the sky. But tonight felt different. There was an undercurrent of unease that prickled at her skin, a sense that something unexpected lurked beneath the surface of this routine flight.
