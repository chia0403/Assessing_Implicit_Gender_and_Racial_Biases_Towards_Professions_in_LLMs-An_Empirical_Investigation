The bell above the door chimed with a cheerful trill as Amelia Rose Butterfield adjusted her comb and surveyed the salon floor. It was nearly empty, save for Mrs. Henderson, perched in the corner like a regal robin on a wire, getting her usual trim.  

Amelia's "Shear Delight" wasn't exactly bustling this Tuesday morning. The sun, still shy behind the smog-veiled skyscrapers of downtown Chicago, hadn't yet managed to lure customers out from their beds. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Maybe it was time for another flyer campaign. Or perhaps a window display featuring those glamorous French braids she'd mastered in her recent online course?  

But then, the door swung open again, and a gust of wind swept in, carrying with it the scent of wet pavement and something distinctly...unusual. It smelled like cinnamon and old books, a peculiar aroma that made Amelia raise an eyebrow. Standing on the threshold was a figure unlike any she'd seen before.  He wore a long, dusty coat, his hat pulled low over his face, and he seemed to emanate a faint aura ofâ€¦ magic?
