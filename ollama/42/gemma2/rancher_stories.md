The wind whipped across Silas Blackwood's weathered face, stinging his eyes with grit.  He squinted at the horizon, where a bruised purple sky bled into the dusty plains of western Montana. The sun, a bleeding ember in its final descent, cast long shadows from the lone cottonwood that stood sentinel over Blackwood Ranch. It was a lonely vigil, Silas thought, just like this life he'd chosen.  

Born and raised beneath the vast Montana sky, Silas knew every inch of his land. He knew where the sagebrush grew thickest, where the wild horses grazed, and where the best buffalo berries could be found. But lately, even the familiar comfort of the ranch felt suffocating. His father's passing had left a gaping hole in his heart, and the ever-present drought threatened to swallow everything he held dear. 


The creaking of rusty hinges announced the arrival of Jebediah, his oldest hand, trudging towards him with the weariness etched deep into his leathery face. Silas knew what Jeb would say – another day, another barren pasture. But tonight, something else simmered beneath the surface of Silas's discontent.  A restless spirit stirred within him, a yearning for something more than the endless cycle of tending livestock and battling the elements. Tonight, he wouldn't just listen to Jebediah’s report; he would tell him his own story – a story of change, perhaps even escape.
