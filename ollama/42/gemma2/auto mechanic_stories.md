The grease on Amelia "Ace" Hawthorne's forearms gleamed like polished mahogany under the fluorescent lights of the garage.  She wiped a stray smear from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving another streak across her already dirt-smudged face. Ace wasn't particularly concerned about appearances. 

Her world revolved around the symphony of clanks and whirs that filled Hawthorne Auto Repair, nestled in the forgotten corner of Salt Lake City where old brick buildings huddled against the relentless winter wind. It was a haven for battered vehicles, castaways from the sleek modern cars that zoomed by on the interstate just a few blocks north. Ace thrived in this chaotic order, her hands calloused and her mind sharp, diagnosing problems with a practiced intuition honed over years under the hood of countless engines. 


Today's challenge was a 1972 Ford pickup, its engine sputtering like a constipated beast. The owner, a weathered rancher named Hank, leaned against the workbench, his brow furrowed with worry.  "She's been my partner for fifteen years," he muttered, "Wouldn't want to see her rust away in some junkyard." Ace met his gaze, her own eyes reflecting the flickering blue light of the diagnostic tool. 

"Give me a few hours, Hank," she said, a quiet confidence settling over her features. "We'll get this girl running again."
