The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous symphony above Ms. Eleanor Vance’s head as she surveyed her history classroom. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst. A lone paper airplane skimmed across the room, narrowly missing Jason Miller’s meticulously combed hair before landing with a soft thud on Mrs. Rodriguez’s desk. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  She was halfway through explaining the intricacies of the Treaty of Versailles when reality seemed to seep into the classroom like a slow leak. The usual buzz of apathy had been replaced by an unsettling quiet, punctuated only by the rustle of turning pages and the occasional cough.

Eleanor knew something was off. It wasn't just the silence; it was the way her students were looking at her – their eyes wide, unblinking, as if they were watching a scene unfold on some distant screen.  

The bell rang, jolting everyone back to the present. But even as students shuffled out of the classroom, their chatter felt forced, unnatural. Eleanor watched them go, a shiver crawling down her spine. 


This wasn’t just another Tuesday afternoon in Mrs. Vance's history class. Something had shifted, something profound and unsettling. And she couldn't shake the feeling that it had everything to do with the strange dream she'd had that morning.
