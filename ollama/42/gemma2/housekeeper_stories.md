The polished brass doorknob gleamed under the morning sun, reflecting Amelia Thistlewick’s tired eyes. She sighed, pressing her hand against its smooth surface as if willing it to open with less resistance. Another day, another grand mansion to tame. The air hung heavy with the scent of lilies – a heady perfume that overwhelmed even the faintest trace of lingering breakfast bacon from the previous night's soirée. 

Amelia lived in this world of immaculate surfaces and whispered secrets, where her days were spent navigating the labyrinthine corridors of wealthy homes like the sprawling manor she currently inhabited: Blackwood Manor.  She knew its every creak and groan, each strategically placed vase designed to mask a rogue dust bunny, and the precise order in which the porcelain figurines on the mantelpiece must be arranged. 

Amelia wasn’t just cleaning; she was preserving an illusion. A world of perfect order where even the tiniest detail whispered stories of wealth and privilege, shielding its inhabitants from the messy reality beyond these opulent walls. Today, however, a feeling of unease prickled beneath her skin. The lilies seemed particularly cloying, and the mansion felt colder than usual, as if holding its breath in anticipation of something unspoken.
