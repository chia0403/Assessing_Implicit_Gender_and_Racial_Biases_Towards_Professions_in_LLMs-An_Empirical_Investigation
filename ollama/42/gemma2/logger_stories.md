The air hung thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar scent to Elias Blackwood as he swung his axe. Sunlight filtered through the canopy, dappling the forest floor in patches of light and shadow.  Elias, calloused hands gripping the worn handle of his axe, took a deep breath, enjoying the quiet solitude before the day's work began. This wasn't just a job for Elias; it was a legacy passed down from generations of Blackwoods who had roamed these Oregon woods. He felt the weight of their history in every swing, every notch carved into the giant fir trees. But today, there was something different in the air, a subtle shift that made the hairs on the back of his neck prickle. The forest seemed to hold its breath, anticipating something unseen. Elias shook off the unease, attributing it to the pre-dawn stillness and focused on the task at hand. He had a quota to meet, after all. 


This wasn't just any day; it was the first of the full moon harvest, when the timber held an ancient magic whispered about in hushed tones by the old-timers. Elias, a pragmatic man who scoffed at folklore, dismissed these tales as fanciful ramblings.  He believed in the tangible - the feel of the axe head biting into wood, the satisfying groan of the falling giant. Yet, as he stepped deeper into the shadowed forest, a prickling sensation intensified, whispering that perhaps there was more to this day than met the eye.
