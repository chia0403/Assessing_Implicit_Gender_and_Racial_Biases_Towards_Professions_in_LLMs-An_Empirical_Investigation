The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Eleanor Vance’s head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sterile office. Her fingers drummed a restless tattoo on the worn surface of her desk, echoing the anxious fluttering in her own chest. Outside, the late September wind rattled the windows of Redwood High School, carrying with it the scent of damp leaves and impending autumn storms. 

Eleanor glanced at the file before her, its contents a jumbled mess of test scores, disciplinary reports, and frantic notes from concerned teachers. The latest student brought to her by Principal Davies was a sixteen-year-old named Liam Carter, described as "quiet," "withdrawn," and "losing interest in everything."  Liam’s eyes, Eleanor knew from the file photos, held a haunted look, like a child bearing a burden too heavy for his young shoulders. He wasn't just struggling; he was drowning. 


This wasn't unusual for Eleanor. As a school psychologist, she dealt with teenage angst and academic pressure on a daily basis. But something about Liam’s case felt different, heavier. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, an intuition whispering that this session wouldn’t be just another day in the office.
