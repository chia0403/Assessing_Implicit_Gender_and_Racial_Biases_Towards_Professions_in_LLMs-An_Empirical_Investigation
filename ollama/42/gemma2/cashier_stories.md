The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Jones like a chorus of tired bees, their buzz a constant companion to the rhythmic beep-beep-beep of the cash register. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and day-old donuts, a familiar aroma in the dusty corner shop where Amelia spent her afternoons. 

Outside, the late July sun blazed mercilessly, turning the asphalt parking lot into a shimmering mirage. Inside, the tiny store was a refuge from the heat, its worn linoleum floor cool beneath Amelia's scuffed sneakers. A faded "Grand Reopening" banner hung crookedly above the counter, a testament to the shop's struggle against time and encroaching supermarkets.  

Amelia sighed, wiping down a sticky counter with a rag that smelled vaguely of bleach and despair. Another slow Tuesday afternoon in the life of Amelia Beatrice Jones, cashier extraordinaire. At least it wasnâ€™t raining.
