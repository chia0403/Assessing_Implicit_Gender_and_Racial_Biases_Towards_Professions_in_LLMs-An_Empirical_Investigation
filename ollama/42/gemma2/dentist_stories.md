Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Finch adjusted her surgical mask, its cool cotton pressing against her flushed cheeks. The air in her dental office, usually humming with the comforting whir of drills and chatter, was thick with an unsettling silence. Outside, the late summer sun beat down on the dusty Texas town of Jericho, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt parking lot.  

Eleanor's clinic, tucked between a boarded-up diner and a pawn shop, was normally bustling this time of year. School was back in session, insurance bills were being paid, and everyone seemed to need a check-up after months of sugary summer treats. But today, the silence felt ominous. The phone hadn't rung once since opening, and not a single patient had crossed her threshold.

Today, however, felt different, like the air itself held its breath, waiting for something to happen. She hoped it wouldn't be anything too terrible.
