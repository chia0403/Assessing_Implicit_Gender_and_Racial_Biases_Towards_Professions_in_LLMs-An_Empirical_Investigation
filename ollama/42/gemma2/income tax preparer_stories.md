The scent of stale coffee and printer ink hung heavy in Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Finch's cramped office.  A single bare bulb cast a sickly yellow light over stacks of paper, each one filled with a year's worth of someone else's financial life. It was tax season again, the time of year when Ellie emerged from her self-imposed hermitage to wrestle receipts, W-2s, and the IRS forms that seemed designed by a sadist. Outside, April showers lashed against the windows of her second-story office above Mrs. Gunderson's bakery. The incessant drumming was a steady counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Ellie's keyboard as she navigated the labyrinthine world of tax deductions.  

Ellie wasn't your typical income tax preparer. While others saw it as a temporary gig, a way to earn extra cash during the spring months, for Ellie it was an art form â€“ a meticulous dance between financial regulations and individual stories. Each return held a piece of someone's life, their joys, their struggles, their anxieties about making ends meet. 


And this year, Ellie had a feeling things were going to be different.
