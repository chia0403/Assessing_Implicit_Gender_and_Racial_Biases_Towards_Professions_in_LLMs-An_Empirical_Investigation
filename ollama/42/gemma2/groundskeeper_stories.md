The dawn mist clung to the manicured lawns like a shy child, reluctant to release its grip on the world.  Dewdrops glistened on emerald blades, each one a tiny prism reflecting the nascent sunlight filtering through the ancient oaks that lined the drive. 

This was Briarwood Manor, a sprawling estate steeped in history and secrets, where the rustling of leaves held whispers of forgotten tales. And amidst this serene landscape, Silas Hawthorne, head groundskeeper for over three decades, moved with the quiet grace of a man who knew every inch of his domain.  His weathered hands, calloused from years of wielding shears and rakes, gently caressed the petals of a newly bloomed rose bush. 

Silas was a solitary soul, content in the company of his plants and animals. He spoke to them, confided in them, finding solace in their silent understanding. But today, a strange disquiet hung in the air, a discordant note in the familiar symphony of Briarwood. The sun seemed dimmer, the birds quieter, and even the scent of freshly cut grass carried an undercurrent of unease.  Silas paused, his gaze sweeping across the manicured landscape, searching for the source of this unsettling feeling.
