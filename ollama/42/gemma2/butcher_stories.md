The air in Silas Blackwood's shop was thick with the scent of iron and blood, a familiar comfort that clung to his apron like a second skin. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Ashwood were bustling with market day activity, but inside the Butcher's Block, time seemed to move at a different pace, measured by the rhythmic thud of cleavers against bone and the quiet murmur of Silas as he worked. 

Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating the glistening slabs of meat hanging from hooks overhead – prime cuts of beef, plump pork loins, plump chickens ready for roasting.  Silas's hands, calloused and strong, moved with practiced precision, his focus unwavering as he trimmed a leg of lamb, his weathered face reflecting years spent in the shadow of the butcher’s block. He was a man of few words, content to let the symphony of the shop – the clanging of knives, the rhythmic rasp of the saw – speak for him. 


But today, an unfamiliar tension crackled in the air, a tremor that ran through Silas like a chill wind. A stranger stood at the threshold, his shadow falling across the worn wooden floorboards, casting an unsettling aura over the familiar sanctuary of the shop.  Silas paused, his gaze lifting from his work to meet the stranger's eyes. The man's face was obscured by the brim of his hat, but there was a glint in his eyes that sent a shiver down Silas’s spine – a glint that spoke of secrets and danger.
