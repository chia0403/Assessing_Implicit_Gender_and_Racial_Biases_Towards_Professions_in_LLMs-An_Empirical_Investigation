The air hung thick with the scent of simmering saffron and burnt sugar.  Amelia Celeste "Amy" Beaumont wiped her brow, leaving a streak of flour across her already smudged cheek. Her tiny kitchen, more akin to a cramped laboratory than a place for culinary creation, was in its usual state: chaotic. Pots overflowed with bubbling concoctions, knives lay scattered on the worn countertop, and recipe books were piled precariously high, threatening to topple like a Jenga tower. 

Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a messy bun, surveyed the scene with a mix of frustration and fierce determination. Tonight was the night. The culmination of months of planning, stress-fueled sleep deprivation, and relentless experimentation â€“ the opening night of "The Midnight Table," her own intimate restaurant tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Prague's Old Town.
