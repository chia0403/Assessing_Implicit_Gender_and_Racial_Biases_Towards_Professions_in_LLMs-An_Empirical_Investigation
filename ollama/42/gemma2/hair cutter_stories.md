The whirring of clippers was like a lullaby to Elias Thorne. He wasn't sure if it soothed his anxieties or amplified them, but amidst the buzzing symphony of blades shearing hair in his small shop, "Thorne & Co.," he felt most at home. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor. The scent of bay rum aftershave lingered, a comforting testament to countless satisfied customers who had walked out of Thorne & Co. with heads held high and newfound confidence.

Elias himself was an enigma. A man whose hands moved with practiced precision while his eyes seemed perpetually lost in thought. His salt-and-pepper hair, cut short and tidy just like the dozens he styled each day, only emphasized the lines etched around his brow - a map of past anxieties perhaps? He wasn't quite sure what secrets those lines held, but they were there, a silent testament to the life he’d lived, the joys and sorrows neatly tucked away beneath that calm exterior.  

It was a Wednesday morning, just past 9 am, when the bell above Thorne & Co.'s door jingled, announcing the arrival of Elias's first client of the day. He glanced up from his meticulously sharpened scissors, ready to weave another tale through hair and conversation. But this wasn’t just any customer. This one carried an air of urgency, a tremor in their step that spoke volumes before they even uttered a word.
