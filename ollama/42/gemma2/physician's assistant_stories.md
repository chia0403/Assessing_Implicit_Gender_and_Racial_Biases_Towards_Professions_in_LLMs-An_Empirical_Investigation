The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Claire Hawthorne, casting a sterile glow on the waiting room crammed with restless patients. Each cough, each sniffle, felt amplified in the small space, echoing against the faded floral wallpaper.  Amelia smoothed her scrubs, trying to ignore the knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. It was always like this in the morning at Northwood Community Clinic – a whirlwind of fevers, anxieties, and exasperated parents trying to wrangle squirmy toddlers. 

Amelia had loved working here since starting as a PA fresh out of school. She thrived on the fast pace, the constant learning, and the satisfaction of helping people when they needed it most. But today felt different. The air crackled with a tension she couldn't place, a sense of anticipation that hung heavy in the stale air. 


Maybe it was the new doctor who started yesterday – Dr. Evans -  with his brooding silence and piercing gaze that seemed to see right through you. Or perhaps it was the whispered rumors circulating among the nurses about an unusual outbreak somewhere in town. Whatever it was, Amelia couldn't shake off the feeling that this day wouldn’t be like any other.
