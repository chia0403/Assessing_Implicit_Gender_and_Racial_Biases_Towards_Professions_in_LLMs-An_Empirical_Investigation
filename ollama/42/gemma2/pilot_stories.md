The acrid smell of jet fuel mingled with the faint tang of saltwater as Amelia "Ace" Nightingale adjusted her headset. The cockpit of the single-engine Cessna 172 hummed around her, a familiar symphony of engine thrum and wind whistling through the open windows. Below, the emerald expanse of the Caribbean Sea shimmered under the relentless tropical sun.  

Amelia squinted against the glare as she scanned the horizon. Her eyes, sharp as a hawk's, darted between the instrument panel and the endless blue, searching for the telltale flicker of a distant fishing boat. She was on a rescue mission, tasked by the Coast Guard to locate and aid a distressed vessel caught in a sudden squall off the coast of St. Lucia.  The storm had passed, leaving behind calm waters that deceptively hid the potential danger lurking beneath.

Amelia breathed out a steady stream of air, her heart drumming against her ribs with a mixture of anticipation and unease. This wasn't just another routine flight. Every second counted. Lives depended on her finding the boat before it was too late.
