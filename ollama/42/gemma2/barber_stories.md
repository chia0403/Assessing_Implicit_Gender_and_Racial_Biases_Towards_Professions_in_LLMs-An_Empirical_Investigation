The aroma of Bay Rum hung heavy in the air, a sweet counterpoint to the sharp scent of bleach clinging to the worn linoleum floor. Sunlight slanted through the dusty window, casting long shadows across the mismatched chairs and faded posters on the walls of "Barnaby's Barbershop." It was a place where time seemed to move at its own languid pace, a haven from the relentless hum of the city outside.  

Barnaby Fitzwilliam, a man whose salt-and-pepper beard mirrored the greying patches in his neatly combed hair, surveyed his shop with a contented sigh. His calloused fingers idly traced the rim of his mug â€“ lukewarm tea and three lumps of sugar, just the way he liked it. A quiet bell tinkled as the door swung open, interrupting his thoughts.  


Barnaby looked up, ready to greet his first customer of the day.
