The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sterile glow over the worn carpet and plastic furniture in the waiting room. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and nervous sweat. It was 8:57 AM on a Tuesday, which meant Dr. Peterson, the clinic's resident shrink, was already running an hour behind schedule. Amelia fidgeted with her name tag - "Amelia" felt too casual for this place, she thought. "Miss Finch" had a nice ring to it, but who am I kidding? They all just called her "Amy." She sighed and glanced at the clock again. 

The waiting room was sparsely populated today: a harried-looking mother with a fussy toddler, an elderly gentleman nervously tapping his foot, and a young woman who seemed lost in her own world, staring intently at a cracked phone screen.  Amelia watched them all with a practiced neutrality, knowing their stories were just another chapter in the endless saga of human suffering that played out within these four walls.  

She longed to escape this purgatory, to be anywhere else but here, surrounded by the unspoken anxieties and simmering emotions of strangers. But rent was due next week, and Amelia needed this job. So, she straightened her posture, forced a smile onto her face, and waited for the bell above the door to chime, signaling the arrival of another soul seeking solace in Dr. Peterson's expertise.
