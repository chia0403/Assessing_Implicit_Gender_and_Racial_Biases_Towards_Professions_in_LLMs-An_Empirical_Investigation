The musty scent of aging paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor Beatrice Ainsworth.  Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, ran her fingers over the spines of ancient volumes lining the shelves of the Blackwood Library, their titles whispering secrets from bygone eras. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness.

Blackwood was a small town tucked away in the Scottish Highlands, shrouded in mist and legend. Its inhabitants were as reserved as the craggy landscape that surrounded them, but Ellie found solace in their shared silence.  The library, with its worn wooden floors and crackling fireplace, was her sanctuary, a world of stories and knowledge where she felt truly at home. 


But today, a sense of unease lingered beneath the familiar comfort. A single crimson letter lay on her desk, its wax seal broken, the paper crackling as she lifted it. Ellie's breath caught in her throat. This wasn't a typical overdue notice or a donation request.  This was an invitation, penned in elegant script, addressed to "The Keeper of Blackwood's Secrets."
