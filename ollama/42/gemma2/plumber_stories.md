The stench hit Arthur Reginald Fitzwilliam III – better known as Reg – before he even turned the corner onto Maple Street. It was a pungent cocktail of rotten eggs and stale despair, laced with something vaguely floral that could only be weeks-old garbage left in the summer sun. 

Reg grimaced, adjusting his tool belt laden with wrenches, pliers, and a roll of duct tape – plumber’s best friend. His beat-up Ford pickup rumbled to a stop in front of number 13, a two-story Victorian house that seemed to sag under the weight of its own history. The peeling paint, overgrown ivy, and boarded-up porch window spoke volumes about the current state of its inhabitant: Mrs. Elara Grimshaw, a notorious recluse known for hoarding both cats and complaints.

This wasn’t Reg’s first rodeo with Mrs. Grimshaw’s plumbing woes. In fact, he suspected she called him whenever something broke just to hear his polite voice and offer him a lukewarm cup of tea brewed from who-knew-what kind of leaves.  But this time was different. The air crackled with an unsettling energy, like the house itself was holding its breath. Reg swallowed nervously. 


"Just another day on the job," he muttered to himself, pulling his cap low over his forehead and pushing open the creaking screen door.
