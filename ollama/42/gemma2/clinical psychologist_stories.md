The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Amelia Rosethorn's head like anxious insects, casting a sterile pallor over the worn leather couch in her office. Outside, the first tentative rays of dawn painted the Seattle skyline with streaks of orange and purple, but inside, it remained perpetually dusk. The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and unspoken anxieties.  Amelia leaned back in her chair, smoothing the wrinkles from her navy cardigan. Her patient, a young woman named Clara, had cancelled at the last minute, leaving Amelia with an unsettling silence. It wasn't uncommon for clients to miss appointments – life, after all, was rarely predictable – but something about Clara's abrupt disappearance felt different. 


Amelia glanced down at the file on her desk. Clara's case notes were a tangled mess of fragmented anxieties and whispered fears. A recurring theme emerged: shadows lurking in the corners of her vision, voices whispering just beyond hearing. Amelia had initially attributed these to classic symptoms of anxiety, but something about the intensity of Clara's descriptions gnawed at her. Was there more to this story than met the eye? Or was she simply letting her own imagination run wild?
