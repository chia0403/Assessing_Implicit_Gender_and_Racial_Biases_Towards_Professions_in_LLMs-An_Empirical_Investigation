The scent of warm sourdough hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Rosemary Butterfield's apron like a comforting hug. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Little Haven were slick with a recent rain, reflecting the dim glow of gaslights that lined the narrow passageways. Inside her bakery, "Butterfield's Bakes,"  Amelia kneaded dough with practiced hands, the rhythmic thud a soothing counterpoint to the gentle patter of rain against the frosted windowpanes.

Little Haven was a town steeped in tradition, its residents fiercely loyal to their daily routines and rituals.  And Amelia, third generation owner of Butterfield's Bakes, was at the heart of it all. Every morning, her pastries filled the air with the promise of warmth and sweetness, drawing locals in like moths to a flickering flame. But today felt different. A knot of unease tightened in Amelia's chest as she watched a stranger approach her shop, his eyes scanning the menu board with an unfamiliar hunger.  


This was no ordinary customer.
