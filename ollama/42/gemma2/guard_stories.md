The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Xylos, carrying with it the scent of frostbite and despair. The sky was the colour of bruised plums, heavy with an impending storm that promised nothing but misery. 

Elias Thorne, his breath frosting in the air, tightened his grip on the hilt of his long sword. He was a veteran guard of House Aerilon, his face etched with the harsh realities of his duty: protecting the fragile borders against the ever-present threat of raiders and wild beasts.  He had seen too much death in these desolate lands, felt the sting of betrayal and the weight of responsibility.

His post stood at the edge of a crumbling stone wall, the last bastion of civilization before the endless expanse of wasteland began. A rickety watchtower, manned only by Elias and his loyal wolfhound, Fenris, offered scant protection against the looming darkness. As twilight bled into night, Elias scanned the horizon, his senses alert for any sign of movement in the gathering storm. 


His gaze lingered on a distant hill, shrouded in swirling mist. A chill ran down his spine, an unsettling premonition that whispered of danger. He wasn't sure if it was the wind, or something else entirely, that seemed to carry a whisper on the breeze – a chillingly familiar sound… the metallic clang of steel.
