The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in Dr. Amelia Croft's nostrils as she stepped into interrogation room four. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the steel table and bolted chair. Outside, sirens wailed, a mournful symphony that echoed the unease gnawing at Amelia’s gut. She wasn’t used to working with murder cases; her expertise lay in the less brutal world of white-collar crime and corporate espionage. Yet, here she was, tasked with assessing the sanity of Thomas Blackwood, a man accused of brutally murdering his wife and her lover. 

The air inside the room felt thick with unspoken words, charged with the residue of past traumas. The only sound besides the distant sirens was the rhythmic drip from a leaky faucet in the corner, each drop like a hammer blow against Amelia’s nerves.  Blackwood sat hunched in his chair, his face shrouded in shadow, eyes fixed on some unseen point beyond her. He looked defeated, a broken bird with clipped wings. But beneath that facade, Amelia sensed something else: an intelligence that was both unsettling and alluring. 


This wasn't the typical case file she’d reviewed. This was a tangled web of deceit, violence, and unspoken desires, and she needed to unravel it before Blackwood became another statistic in the city's ever-growing list of unsolved homicides.
