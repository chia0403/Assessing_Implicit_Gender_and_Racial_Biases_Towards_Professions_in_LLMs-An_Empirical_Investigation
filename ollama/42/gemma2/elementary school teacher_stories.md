The scent of chalk dust and hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of peanut butter sandwiches from lunchtime. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Pinewood's third-grade classroom, illuminating rows of mismatched desks clustered around her makeshift reading nook – a comfy armchair draped in a faded paisley blanket.  

Eleanor tapped a pencil against her teeth, squinting at the stack of brightly coloured storybooks before her. It was Read Across America Day, and while she usually relished the chance to share her love of literature with her students, today felt different. A knot of anxiety tightened in her chest, refusing to loosen its grip. 


This year, Eleanor had a feeling things were about to change – dramatically.
