The air in St. Jude's Hospital felt thick with unspoken anxieties, a miasma that clung to Dr. Amelia Claire Beaumont like a second skin. Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  She stood in the dimly lit hallway outside the intensive care unit, clutching a lukewarm cup of coffee that had long since gone cold. Every rustle of the medical cart wheels, every beep from a distant monitor, sent a jolt of anticipation through her. 

St. Jude's was notorious for its complex cases, for being the last resort when hope seemed to dwindle. Tonight, it felt like the weight of all those unanswered prayers rested on Amelia's shoulders. Her patient, Mr. Thomas Carter, lay just beyond that door, his life tethered by a fragile web of machines and a doctor's unwavering will.  He was a good man, Amelia knew. A widower with two rambunctious grandchildren who adored him. And tonight, he needed her more than ever.
