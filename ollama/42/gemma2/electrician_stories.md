The humid air hung heavy over Willow Creek, Louisiana, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and simmering catfish. A fat summer rain had just passed, leaving the streets slick and reflecting the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign hanging precariously above the Rusty Wrench Diner.  

Inside, Elijah Bartholomew wiped his brow with a calloused hand, the sweat already starting to bead up again. He tugged his worn electrician's hat off his head, revealing a mess of dark curls that clung to his forehead. "Just another night in paradise," he muttered, taking a swig from his lukewarm coffee. 

Elijah was Willow Creek through and through, born and raised in this small town where everyone knew your name and the gossip travelled faster than a Louisiana hurricane. He’d learned the trade from his grandfather, Old Man Bartholomew, who'd taught him everything there was to know about wiring, circuits, and troubleshooting power outages.  

He glanced at the clock ticking above the counter – 8:32 PM. His shift at the diner ended in an hour. But tonight, Elijah had a bigger fish to fry - literally. The old Johnson family farm, known for its prize-winning catfish, had called about a busted transformer, plunging their operation into darkness.  


Elijah sighed. Another night, another problem waiting to be solved. He just hoped the Johnsons hadn't lost too many of their prized catfish in the meantime.
