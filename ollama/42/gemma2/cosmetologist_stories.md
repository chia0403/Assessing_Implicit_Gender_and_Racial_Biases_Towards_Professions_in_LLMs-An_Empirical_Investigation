The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and bergamot as Seraphina Bellweather swept her way through her salon, "Seraphim's Shear." Sunlight streamed through the large, arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The usual lunchtime hum of conversation and hair dryers was replaced by an unnerving silence. Every chair was empty, every station meticulously clean - too clean. 

Seraphina paused, her hand hovering over a shelf of colourful hair dyes. This wasn't right.  Her clients wouldn't just vanish mid-appointment. She glanced at the clock - 1:03 pm. Her most loyal client, Mrs. Hawthorne, was due in any minute for her weekly perm. Something felt deeply off. A chill snaked down Seraphina's spine, making the delicate silver earrings gifted to her by her late grandmother feel cold against her skin.


The salon, nestled on a quiet street lined with independent shops and quaint cafes, usually pulsed with energy.  Today, it felt eerily deserted, like a stage set waiting for its actors.
