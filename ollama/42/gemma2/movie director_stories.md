The air hung thick with the scent of stale popcorn and desperation in the cramped screening room. Amelia "Amy" Harper-Jones, her usually impeccable bun now slightly askew, chewed on a thumbnail while watching the disastrous test screening of her latest project.

Set against the backdrop of a crumbling Victorian mansion overlooking the tempestuous Irish Sea, “The Whispering Tide” was supposed to be Amy’s breakout film – a gothic horror with a twist of paranormal romance.  Instead, it felt like a low-budget high school play, drowning in melodramatic dialogue and special effects that looked more laughable than frightening. The audience's reaction wasn't much better: stifled yawns, the occasional rustle of candy wrappers, and at one point, a rather loud snore from a man slumped in the front row.

Amy could feel her stomach twisting with each disappointed groan.  She’d poured her heart and soul into this project, sacrificing countless late nights and enduring endless budget cuts. Now, it felt like all that effort was going down the drain, disappearing into the swirling mists of an Irish storm brewing outside.


**Setting:** A cluttered screening room in a dilapidated film studio on the outskirts of Dublin, Ireland. Rain lashes against the windows, mirroring the turmoil within Amy.
