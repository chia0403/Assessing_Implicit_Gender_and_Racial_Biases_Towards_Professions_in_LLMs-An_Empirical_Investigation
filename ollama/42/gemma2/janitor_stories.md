The stale air hung heavy in the grand ballroom, thick with the scent of dust and forgotten champagne. Moonlight filtered through the dusty skylights, illuminating swirling motes and casting long shadows on the worn parquet floor.  

Elias Finch, custodian extraordinaire and bane of every overflowing bin in the dilapidated Chateau de Lumière, meticulously mopped a particularly stubborn stain left by a spilled punch bowl at last week’s gala. He hummed a tuneless melody under his breath, his head bent over the work, ignoring the eerie silence that seemed to press down on the grand space. The ballroom, once a vibrant stage for glittering soirées and boisterous dances, now stood as a monument to forgotten grandeur, its ornate chandeliers draped in cobwebs and its velvet curtains faded to a somber grey.


 Elias, with his calloused hands and worn-out uniform, was an unlikely guardian of this lost splendor. He found solace in the quiet solitude, the rhythmic swish of his mop a comforting counterpoint to the silence. But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down his spine, whispering that something was amiss amidst the dust and shadows.
