The pungent aroma of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint scent of crayons and Play-Doh that clung stubbornly to the carpet in Ms. Eleanor Blythe's classroom. Sunlight streamed through the mismatched windows, casting colourful squares on the scattered toys and half-finished artwork.  

Eleanor, a woman whose patience was as boundless as her affection for the tiny humans entrusted to her care, wiped down a sticky table with a sigh. It was Tuesday, which meant macaroni art day, and the evidence of that creative explosion was everywhere. 


She glanced at the clock: 10:58 am. In precisely two minutes, the toddlers would be free from their naptime slumber and descend upon the room like a swarm of brightly-colored bumblebees.  Eleanor smiled; she wouldn't trade this chaotic symphony for anything in the world. After all, even amidst the sticky fingerprints and endless requests for juice boxes, there was magic in watching these little souls blossom.
