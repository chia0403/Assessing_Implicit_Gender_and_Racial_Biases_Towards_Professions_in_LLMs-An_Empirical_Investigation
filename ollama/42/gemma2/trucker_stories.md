The diner’s fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony with the low growl of the eighteen-wheeler idling outside. Rain lashed against the greasy windows, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign into a hazy, shimmering mirage. Inside, Amelia "Millie" Harper hunched over a lukewarm cup of coffee, her weathered face illuminated by the flickering light of the television playing some daytime soap opera in the corner. Millie had been driving since she was eighteen, hauling freight across the endless expanse of America.  Now, at forty-two, with miles etched into every line on her face and stories in every calloused fingertip, the open road was her only solace. She knew every crack in the pavement, every greasy spoon diner, every lonely truck stop from Chicago to Los Angeles like a map imprinted on her soul. Tonight, however, the solitude felt heavy, pressing down on her with the weight of a thousand unanswered questions. 


Her rig, "The Big Bluebird," sat outside, bathed in the sickly yellow light of the streetlamps. The rain was relentless, blurring the lines between night and day, creating an atmosphere of unsettling quietude that made Millie feel more alone than ever.  She glanced at her phone – no messages, no calls. Just another night on the road, another mile marker passing, another step further away from everything familiar.
