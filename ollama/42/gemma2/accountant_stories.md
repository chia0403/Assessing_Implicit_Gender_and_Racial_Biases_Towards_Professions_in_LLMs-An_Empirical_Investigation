The air in Agnes Pembrooke's office hung heavy with the scent of old paper and stale coffee. It was the kind of smell that clung to you long after you left, a reminder that even the most meticulous order couldn't quite mask the relentless march of time.  Agnes, perched on her swivel chair behind her mountain of spreadsheets, sighed. Outside, London bustled with the usual frenetic energy of a Tuesday morning, but in Agnes's world, the only movement was the frantic clicking of her keyboard as she tried to reconcile a particularly troublesome discrepancy in Mr. Bartholomew's accounts. 

Agnes wasn't one for drama, preferring the predictable rhythm of numbers and figures. She found solace in the neat lines of ledgers, the satisfying click of her calculator, and the quiet hum of the fluorescent lights that illuminated her small office on the third floor of a decidedly un-chic building tucked away in a forgotten corner of Bloomsbury.  Her world was one of debits and credits, where every penny had its place, and chaos was an unacceptable anomaly. Yet, today, Agnes felt a prickle of unease. The discrepancy wasn't just a simple error â€“ it felt like the opening salvo in a much larger, more unsettling mystery.
