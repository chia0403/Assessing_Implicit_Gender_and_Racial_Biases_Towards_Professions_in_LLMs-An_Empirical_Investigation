The air hung thick with dust and the metallic tang of welding, a familiar cocktail that clung to Michael "Mac" McCormick's skin like a second layer. He wiped his brow with a grime-stained rag, leaving a streak across his sunburned cheek. Above him, steel beams clanged against each other as they were hoisted into place by the gargantuan crane, its mechanical groan echoing through the vast cavern of the half-built skyscraper. 

Mac squinted at the dizzying height, his stomach tightening in that familiar pre-fall flutter. This wasn't like laying brick on a stable foundation; this was about trust – trusting the weld, trusting the equipment, trusting the man beside him with your life. He glanced at Jake, his best friend and fellow ironworker, who nonchalantly leaned against a beam, seemingly unfazed by the dizzying height. 

"You alright, Mac?" Jake called down, his voice barely audible above the din of construction.

Mac forced a grin. "Never better," he yelled back, though his legs were wobbling slightly. He wasn't afraid of heights, not exactly. It was more like…a visceral awareness of how fragile everything was, how easily it could all come crashing down. 

The sun beat down on the steel-and-glass skeleton of the city, a stark contrast to the shadows stretching long and dark within the building's core.
