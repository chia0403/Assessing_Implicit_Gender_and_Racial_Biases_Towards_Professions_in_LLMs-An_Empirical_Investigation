The air hung thick with the scent of roasting garlic and simmering rosemary as Amelia Rose Hawthorne surveyed her domain: The Copper Kettle, nestled in the heart of the bustling seaside town of Seahaven. 

It was just past noon, the lunch rush kicking into high gear.  Amelia, a whirlwind of flour-dusted aprons and fiery auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, moved with practiced grace through the kitchen, her every action honed by years of experience. Orders flew in - clam chowder for tourists basking on the pier, hearty fish stew for weathered fishermen returning from their morning haul, and delicate pastries for the ladies meeting at the cafe tables outside.  

But Amelia’s eyes were focused on something else: a lone table tucked away in the corner, occupied by a young man with piercing blue eyes and an air of quiet melancholy. He hadn't touched his untouched bowl of spaghetti carbonara, his gaze lost somewhere beyond the window overlooking the churning sea. 


Amelia knew, without needing to be told, that this was more than just a case of a bad meal.  There was a story etched on this young man’s face, a hunger that ran deeper than any craving for food. And Amelia, with her heart as big as her kitchen and a knack for seeing through facades, felt an irresistible pull to unravel it.
