The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes as he hoisted another section of asphalt onto the truck bed. His calloused hands, permanently etched with the map of years spent wrestling concrete and gravel, trembled slightly from the effort. The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and burnt rubber, punctuated by the distant rumble of traffic thundering along Interstate 85, a relentless river of metal slicing through the heart of Georgia.  

Silas squinted at the endless ribbon of road that stretched before him, shimmering under the unforgiving July heat. It was a familiar sight, one heâ€™d witnessed for nearly two decades, patching, sealing, and mending the arteries of this southern state. Each mile marker held a story, each pothole a silent testament to time's relentless passage. But today, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the humidity, as if the very asphalt beneath his feet vibrated with an unspoken unease.  


As he wiped the sweat from his brow, Silas noticed a plume of smoke rising on the horizon, like a phantom against the azure sky. It was too far away to discern its source, but it seemed to beckon him forward, weaving itself into the tapestry of his mundane day, promising something beyond the usual routine of asphalt and grit.
