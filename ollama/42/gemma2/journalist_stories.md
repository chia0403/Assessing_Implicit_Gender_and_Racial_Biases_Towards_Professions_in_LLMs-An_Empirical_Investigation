Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled through the rusted fire escape, rattling the single window she shared with three other reporters – each hunched over their keyboards, faces illuminated by the sickly glow of their screens.  The city itself seemed to echo the quiet desperation that filled the room; a symphony of sirens wailing in the distance, punctuated by the clatter of construction and the rumble of passing trains. Amy sighed, her gaze falling on the latest assignment tacked haphazardly to the board: "Missing Person - No Leads." A shiver ran down her spine. Another soul lost in the labyrinthine heart of Chicago.
