The rain hammered against the windshield, blurring the neon signs of the strip mall into streaks of hazy color. Evelyn Marie Thompson sighed, pressing her knuckles against the cool glass. Another night shift, another caseload overflowing with stories she didn’t have time to hear.  

Evelyn was a probation officer for the 12th district, and this corner of town was about as far from the pristine white hallways of the courthouse as you could get. This stretch of Route 66 was choked with flickering motels, pawn shops with names that promised more than they delivered, and bars promising oblivion in equal measure. It was a place where dreams went to die, or maybe just hibernate until spring.  

Tonight, she was meeting with Javier "Jay" Ramirez at the Rusty Spoon diner – a greasy spoon with booths worn smooth by countless whispered confessions and broken promises. Jay was her most challenging case: a talented musician caught up in the wrong crowd, facing charges for possession and resisting arrest. His lawyer had pleaded mitigation on the grounds of rehabilitation, and Evelyn had been tasked with ensuring that rehabilitation actually happened. 

The diner’s fluorescent lights buzzed overhead as she pushed open the door, the scent of stale coffee and frying bacon washing over her.  Evelyn scanned the booth in the corner – Jay's usual spot – but it was empty. His phone went straight to voicemail.


He was late, again. And Evelyn was already running behind schedule.
