The whirring of the ultrasonic scaler vibrated through Amelia Beatrice Thornton's fingertips, a familiar hum that signaled another day in her brightly lit purgatory.  Her smile, plastered on for the patient before her – Mrs. Peterson, perpetually battling gum disease – felt as synthetic as the pink plastic bib draped across the elderly woman's chest. The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint cloying sweetness of Mrs. Peterson’s cinnamon breath.  The waiting room outside hummed with a low thrum of anxiety; the kind that only came from facing dental instruments. Amelia sighed, wishing she were anywhere else but in this cramped, fluorescent-lit corner of Dr. Miller's practice.


She longed for sunshine, wind in her hair, and anything remotely resembling adventure. The life of a dental hygienist was a monotonous dance between scraping tartar and reassuring patients about the inevitable pain of root canals.  But Amelia wasn’t just any hygienist. She had dreams, whispered ambitions that lay dormant beneath the weight of responsibility and bills. 


Her gaze drifted to a framed photograph perched precariously on the shelf behind Mrs. Peterson's head. It depicted a breathtaking landscape – snow-capped mountains piercing a clear blue sky, turquoise glacial lakes reflecting the sun's rays. A postcard from her sister, Elara, who had traded their dreary hometown for life as a freelance photographer in Nepal. 


Amelia traced the outline of the mountain peaks with her eyes.  One day, she thought, that could be me. One day, I will escape this dental purgatory and find my own adventure.
