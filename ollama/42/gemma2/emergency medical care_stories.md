The air hung thick with the smell of exhaust fumes and rain-slicked asphalt.  Neon signs flickered erratically, casting an unsettling glow on the puddles reflecting the cityscape's grim silhouette. A steady drizzle punctuated the night, each drop exploding into miniature fireworks against the grimy pavement. This was Gotham, a city that never slept, but tonight, even the underbelly seemed to be holding its breath. 

Inside his battered ambulance,  Elliot Hayes - or Eli, as everyone called him - was meticulously reviewing patient records, his brow furrowed in concentration. The fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across his face, highlighting the exhaustion etched into his features. Years of navigating Gotham's chaos had taken their toll, but Eli wouldn't have traded his job for anything. He was a lifeline, an anchor in the storm for those who needed him most. 


As sirens wailed in the distance, Eli felt a familiar surge of adrenaline. Another night, another chance to make a difference.  The call came crackling through the radio: "Possible stabbing at The Serpent's Den - respond immediately." Eli didn't hesitate. He slammed his folder shut, threw on his coat, and barked out orders to his partner, Danny.


The Serpent's Den. A notorious dive bar known for its questionable clientele and even more questionable security. Eli knew this wasn't going to be a simple case. Gotham rarely was.
