The humid New Orleans air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and stale bourbon. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Detective Alistair "Al" Beaumont's office, blurring the neon glow of the French Quarter across the street.  

Alistair wasn't fazed by the storm brewing outside. He was more concerned with the tempest swirling within his own head. Three days, three sleepless nights, and a case that smelled as rotten as the garbage piling up on the sidewalk below. The missing person – a prominent socialite named Celeste Dupree – had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a cryptic note and a trail of whispers about a forbidden love affair and dangerous secrets. 

Al swirled the amber liquid in his glass, the whiskey burning a familiar path down his throat. He needed to clear his head, but the case gnawed at him like a persistent itch he couldn't scratch.  It felt different this time, more personal. There was something about Celeste, her beauty tinged with an underlying sadness, that resonated with him. Perhaps it was because she reminded him of someone…someone he'd rather forget.
