The scent of lilies and old books hung heavy in the air, a peculiar but oddly comforting aroma that seemed to permeate every corner of the grand Victorian mansion. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses, pushing them further up her nose as she surveyed the scene before her. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating faded floral wallpaper and a once-opulent chandelier now shrouded in cobwebs.  

Amelia, known to clients as simply "Amy," was an interior decorator with a penchant for breathing life back into forgotten spaces. Her latest project: transforming this crumbling relic into a vibrant haven for the recently widowed Professor Edward Blackwood.  His request had been simple – “Make it home again.” 
But Amelia knew that going beyond mere aesthetics was necessary. She felt an unspoken weight clinging to these walls, a palpable sorrow that needed to be gently nudged aside. As she stepped further into the cavernous drawing-room, a shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't just another renovation project. This was a journey into the past, and perhaps, a chance to heal old wounds.
