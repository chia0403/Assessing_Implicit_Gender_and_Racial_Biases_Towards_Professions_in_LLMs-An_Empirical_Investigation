The scent of peppermint oil hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint whiff of antiseptic that clung to Dr. Evelyn Beaumont's white coat. Her small practice, nestled on a quiet side street in Asheville, North Carolina, was bathed in the warm glow of late afternoon sunlight filtering through stained glass windows depicting whimsical anatomical diagrams.  A gentle jazz melody drifted from the Bose speaker in the corner, creating an ambiance that was both calming and invigorating. Evelyn loved this time of day â€“ the lull before the evening rush, when she could steal a moment to herself amidst the organized chaos of her practice. 


Her fingers traced the worn spine of a book on spinal anatomy, a treasured gift from her mentor. Outside, the rhythmic hum of cicadas serenaded the approaching dusk, a soundtrack to the city slowly awakening after a long day. Evelyn took a deep breath, savoring the quiet before the familiar symphony of cracking joints and grateful sighs filled her little world again.
