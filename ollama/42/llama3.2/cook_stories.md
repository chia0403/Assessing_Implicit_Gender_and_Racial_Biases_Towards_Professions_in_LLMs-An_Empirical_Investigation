Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the small coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling harbor. The smell of fresh seafood and saltwater filled the air as people strolled along the pier, enjoying the last moments of summer before the chill of winter began to creep in.
