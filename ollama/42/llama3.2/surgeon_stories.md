Here's a potential story opening:

The stormy night air clung to Dr. Elliot Ryder Wellington III like a damp shroud as he stepped out of his sleek black sedan and onto the rain-soaked parking lot of St. Michael's Hospital. The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow on the deserted scene, illuminating only the wet pavement and the faint outlines of hospital cars still parked outside the entrance.

At 37, Elliot Wellington was one of the most respected surgeons in New Haven, with a reputation for precision and compassion that had earned him a loyal following among his patients. But as he gazed up at the imposing stone facade of St. Michael's, a sense of unease settled in the pit of his stomach. Tonight was different, though - tonight, Elliot wasn't just coming to work. He was coming home.

Elliot pushed open the heavy glass door and stepped into the warm, humid air inside, the scent of antiseptic and disinfectant enveloping him like a familiar hug. As he made his way through the deserted corridors, his eyes scanned the hospital's interior, taking in the sterile surfaces and the rows of empty beds lined up like sentinels. It was quiet tonight, but Elliot knew that was because everyone - including himself - had been waiting for something.

And then, just as he turned a corner into the ICU ward, his phone buzzed in his pocket with an incoming text from an unknown number: "Don't go upstairs yet."
