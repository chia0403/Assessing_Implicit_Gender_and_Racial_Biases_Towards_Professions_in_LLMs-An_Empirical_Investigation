Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Drygulch Ranch, casting a golden glow over the rolling hills and dusty trails that crisscrossed the land like a network of veins. It was a sight that had been etched into the mind of rancher Ethan Austin Ryder for as long as he could remember - the same one his grandfather had looked at with pride when he first took over the reins of this piece of land.

Ethan stood atop the porch of the old homestead, surveying the spread before him. The Drygulch Ranch was more than just a collection of pastures and fences; it was a way of life that had been passed down through generations of Ryders. His family's legacy was one of hard work, resilience, and a deep connection to the land.

As he watched, a faint plume of dust rose on the horizon - a lone rider making their way towards the ranch house. Ethan's eyes narrowed slightly as he wondered who it might be, and what they wanted. The Drygulch Ranch was a place where strangers were few and far between, and when someone did show up, it was usually for business.

Ethan's thoughts were interrupted by the creak of the old swing on the porch, as his grandfather's rocking chair gently came to rest beside him. "You know who that might be, son?" he asked, his voice low and gravelly from years of shouting over cattle calls and ranch work.

Ethan turned to face his grandfather, a mixture of curiosity and trepidation in his eyes. "Who is it, Pa?"
