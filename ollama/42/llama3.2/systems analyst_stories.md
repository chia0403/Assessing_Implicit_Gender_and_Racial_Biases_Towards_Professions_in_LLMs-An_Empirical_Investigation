Here's a potential story opening and setting for a mystery or thriller:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this. The 9 PM Greyhound bus rumbled to a stop outside the drab, fluorescent-lit lobby of the Bellvue Hotel, casting a faint hum of engine noise into the sterile air. Emily J. Wilson, systems analyst for the city's Department of Public Works, stepped off the bus and onto the wet pavement, her eyes scanning the deserted lobby with a practiced air of caution.

It had been six months since her last night on duty, and yet the familiar contours of the hotel's decor still felt like a trap: the worn armchairs, the flickering fluorescent lights, the echoey corridors that seemed to stretch on forever. Emily checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time â€“ she was already running ten minutes behind schedule.

Her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her colleague, Rachel Lee: "Tanya's car is dead. Meet me at the old warehouse at 10."

Emily tucked her phone into her jacket pocket and followed the sound of dripping water to the hotel's small lobby bar, where a lone waitress was polishing a glass with a dirty rag. The bartender, a gruff-looking man with a scruffy beard, nodded curtly as Emily ordered a coffee and asked about the weather forecast for the night.

"The usual," he said, his voice like gravel. "Rain, wind, more rain."

Emily took her coffee and headed back out into the night, the chill of the air biting at her skin like a slap in the face. She had a feeling tonight was going to be a long one.
