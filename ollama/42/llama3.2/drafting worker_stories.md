Here's a potential story opening:

The dim fluorescent lights above the drafting table cast an unforgiving glare on the rows of neat, numbered folders in front of Emily J. Thompson, her eyes scanning the intricate designs with a practiced intensity. It was 4:45 PM on a typical Wednesday afternoon at Wilson & Associates, a mid-sized engineering firm in downtown Detroit's RiverWalk district. The hum of the air conditioning and the soft chatter of coworkers provided a steady background din as Emily worked to meet an impending deadline for a new project. With her elbows propped up against the table and her pen poised over a yellowed blueprint, she was lost in the world of precision engineering, where margins were measured in millimeters and one miscalculation could spell disaster.

Her dark brown hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks that seemed to darken in intensity when she focused intensely on her work. With over five years of experience under her belt, Emily had earned a reputation as one of Wilson & Associates' top drafting workers, and this project, codenamed "Aquarius," was shaping up to be the most challenging yet.

As she worked, Emily's mind wandered to the strange phone call she'd received earlier that day from an unknown number. The voice on the other end had been curt and menacing, warning her to "drop it" or face consequences.
