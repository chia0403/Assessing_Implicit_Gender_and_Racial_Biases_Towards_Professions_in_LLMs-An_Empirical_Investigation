Here's a story opening:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Ravenswood, casting a dark shadow over its crumbling buildings and deserted streets. The only sound was the distant hum of crickets and the soft crunch of gravel beneath the boots of Guardsman Kaidën Ryder Thompson.

Kaidën stood atop the high wall that surrounded the town's central square, his eyes scanning the darkness below for any sign of movement. As a member of the elite Guard unit responsible for protecting Ravenswood from the dangers that lurked in the nearby forest, Kaidën took pride in his role. He had grown up here, learning the ins and outs of the town and its people, and he knew every nook and cranny, every hidden alleyway and secret passage.

The wind rustled through the trees, causing the wooden sign above the gate to creak ominously in the breeze: "Welcome to Ravenswood - Population 2,500". Kaidën's gaze lingered on it for a moment before returning his attention to the darkness below. Something didn't feel right tonight.
