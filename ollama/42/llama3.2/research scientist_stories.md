Here's a potential story opening and setting for your consideration:

---

Dr. Emilia Sofia Rodriguez gazed out the rain-soaked window of her laboratory, the grey London mist swirling like a living entity outside the insulated walls of King's College London. The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow on the rows of petri dishes and microscopes, illuminating the endless rows of specimens that filled every available surface. Emilia's eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed to hold a world of fatigue, squinted slightly as she rubbed the tiredness from her eyelids.

It had been three days since the lab had suffered its first reported case of contamination, and Emilia was still trying to make sense of it all. The normally sterile environment of their virology department had been breached, leaving a trail of infected samples in its wake. As a leading researcher in the field of viral genetics, Emilia's work on developing new treatments for Ebola and HIV was always high-pressure, but this latest development had taken the air out of her lungs.

The phone on her desk shrilled suddenly, jolting Emilia back to reality. She picked it up, her voice firm as she answered, "Lab 3."

"Dr. Rodriguez, we need you in the conference room now," a colleague said from across the lab. The lines crackled with tension as Emilia's heart quickened â€“ whatever was happening, it couldn't be good.

With a sense of foreboding that threatened to engulf her, Emilia set down the phone and made her way towards the conference room, ready to face whatever horrors awaited her in the midst of this unfolding crisis.
