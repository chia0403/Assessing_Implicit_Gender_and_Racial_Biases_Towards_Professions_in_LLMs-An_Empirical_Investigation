Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The city skyline was ablaze with the golden glow of sunset as Executive Director Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of her high-rise office building, gazing out over the concrete jungle below. The wind whipped through her dark brown hair, carrying the faint scent of rain that had threatened to unleash itself all day but seemed to be holding off.

As she scanned the horizon, Lexi's mind was already on the meeting with the board of directors that would take place in less than an hour. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar tension building in her chest. The CEO position she'd been running for the past five years had been going well, but she knew it wouldn't last forever.

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, breaking the spell. Lexi pulled it out to see a text from her assistant, reminding her of the meeting and suggesting that she review the latest quarterly reports before heading down. Lexi nodded to herself, knowing that was exactly what she needed to do. She took one last look at the city below, feeling the rush of adrenaline mixed with uncertainty.

The bright lights of the skyscrapers seemed to mock her, reminding her that in just a few minutes, she would be standing in front of a room full of people who could decide her fate. Lexi smiled to herself, a fierce determination igniting within her. She was ready for whatever came next.

Lexi Thompson was 42 years old, with piercing green eyes and an unyielding sense of ambition that had driven her to the top of her field.
