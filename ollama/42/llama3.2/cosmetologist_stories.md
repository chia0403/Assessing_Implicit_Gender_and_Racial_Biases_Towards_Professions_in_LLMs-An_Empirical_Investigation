The aroma of lavender and chamomile wafted through the air as Rory expertly braided a client's hair, her fingers moving with practiced ease.

The cozy little salon on Hawthorne Boulevard was home to Rory's passion project: Beauty & Bliss.

From the warm hues of the reclaimed wood walls to the soft hum of indie folk music playing in the background, every detail had been carefully curated to make clients feel at ease.

Growing up, she had always been fascinated by the way makeup could transform someone's entire demeanor â€“ but it wasn't until a painful breakup left her feeling lost and uncertain about herself that she discovered her true calling as a stylist. Now, as she worked tirelessly to build Beauty & Bliss into a beloved fixture in the community, Rory couldn't help but wonder what the future held for her and her little slice of Portland heaven.
