Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The fog rolled in off the canal, shrouding the narrow streets of 18th century London in a damp, grey mist. In a small workshop nestled between a bustling market stall and a row of worn stone buildings, Emilia Fanshawe sat hunched over her workbench, surrounded by scraps of silk and velvet, threads of gold and silver, and the soft hum of her sewing machine.

At 25, Emilia was already a skilled dress maker, renowned for her exquisite taste and attention to detail. Her small workshop, tucked away in a quiet alleyway, was a haven for the fashionable ladies of London's high society, who came to her for bespoke gowns that made them feel like royalty. With her slender fingers moving deftly over the fabric, Emilia was creating something truly special - a gown that would soon make its debut at the prestigious Lady Marlborough's Ball, an event that promised to be the social highlight of the season.

As she worked, the sound of horse hooves echoed through the alleyway outside, and the workshop door creaked open, admitting a chill breeze and a visitor who would change Emilia's life forever.
