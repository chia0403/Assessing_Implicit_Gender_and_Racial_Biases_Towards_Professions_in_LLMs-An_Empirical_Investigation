Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Evelyn Joy Taylor stepped out of the stormy night air and into the warm glow of the hospital's emergency department, her eyes scanning the chaotic scene before her. The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the sea of anxious faces, each one telling a story of its own desperation and urgency. As an ER doctor with years of experience under her belt, Evelyn was no stranger to the high-stakes world of emergency medicine. But tonight felt different, the atmosphere thick with an unspoken sense of unease that left her feeling on edge.

**Setting:**

The Emergency Department at Mercy Hospital, located in the heart of downtown Seattle, Washington. The city's rapid growth and tech industry had brought a surge of new residents to the area, leaving the hospital strained to keep up with the demand for emergency care. As one of the busiest ERs in the country, Mercy's ED was always bustling, but tonight it felt like the whole world had converged on its doors.

The storm that had rolled in earlier that evening was still intensifying, the howling wind and lashing rain threatening to flood the hospital's parking garage. But inside, the ER team was already racing against time, their focus laser-sharp as they battled to save lives amidst the chaos.

Evelyn made her way through the throngs of patients, her gaze darting between the various stations: Trauma Bay 3, where a young family sat huddled together after a car accident; Pediatric Intensive Care Unit, where a team of specialists frantically monitored a newborn with respiratory distress; and the busy triage area, where nurses were sorting patients into the appropriate treatment tracks.

As she navigated the crowded ER, Evelyn's trained ear picked up snippets of conversation, each one weaving together to form a patchwork quilt of human experience. She listened attentively, her mind processing the complex web of medical concerns, social issues, and personal struggles that each patient represented.

And yet, despite the chaos, Evelyn felt an unsettling sense of calm, as if something was nudging at the edges of her awareness. It was a feeling she couldn't quite explain, but one that made her pause in the midst of the mayhem, and wonder: what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of this stormy night?
