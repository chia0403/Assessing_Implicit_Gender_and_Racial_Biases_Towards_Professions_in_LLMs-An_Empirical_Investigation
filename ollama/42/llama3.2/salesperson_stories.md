Here's a story opening and setting:

---

As she stepped out of her apartment building and onto the bustling streets of Manhattan, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson adjusted her designer handbag and surveyed the crowded sidewalks. A bright, sunny day seemed to mock her as she trudged through the sea of people, her heels clicking against the pavement in a rhythmic cadence.

Lexi was a salesperson at a high-end jewelry store on Fifth Avenue, known for her razor-sharp instincts and ability to close deals with even the most discerning clients. But despite her professional success, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had been growing inside her all week. She felt like she was just going through the motions, peddling luxury goods to wealthy customers who only cared about status symbols.

As she made her way to the subway, Lexi's mind began to wander to her upcoming meeting with a potential new client, a young entrepreneur looking to make a splash in the fashion world. She had been tasked with showing him the store's latest collection, but she couldn't help feeling like this was just another transaction, another sale to add to her already impressive ledger.

The subway car lurched into motion, and Lexi found herself squashed between a group of rowdy teenagers and a businessman typing away on his phone. She closed her eyes, taking a deep breath as the train hurtled through the tunnels beneath the city. Little did she know, this was just the beginning of a day that would challenge everything she thought she knew about success, style, and herself.
