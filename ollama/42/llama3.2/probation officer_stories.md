Here's a possible story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving on Fridays, but that was just another day for Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a seasoned probation officer with the Washington State Department of Corrections. As she trudged through the downpour, her eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks of Pioneer Square, where the city's most troubled youth and hardened felons roamed free.

Alexandra Thompson had spent years navigating the dark underbelly of Seattle's social services system, working tirelessly to keep at-risk kids like Juan Sanchez out of the prison industrial complex. Her latest assignment was a doozy: Juan, a 19-year-old former gang member with a string of convictions for theft and assault, was fresh off a stint in juvenile detention and now sat under her supervision on conditional release.

Lexi's phone buzzed in her pocket as she turned onto First Avenue, the sounds of the city's nightlife - bars, clubs, and live music venues - mingling with the hum of taxis and sirens in the distance. She pulled out the call log to see who was trying to reach her. Only one person ever managed to cut through the din: her old partner, now a detective with the Seattle Police Department.

"Hey, Lexi," a gravelly voice crackled over the line. "We got another body in Pioneer Square. Looks like our friend Juan didn't take his probation too seriously."

Lexi's gut tightened as she slowed to a stop at the corner of First and Pike. This was not good. Not by a long shot.
