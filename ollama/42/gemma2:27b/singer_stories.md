The air in the dingy bar hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale beer, clinging to Eliza Marie Hawthorne's velvet dress like a second skin.  She adjusted the microphone stand, its chrome dulled by years of spilled drinks and careless hands. The stage lights, flickering fluorescent tubes barely concealed behind frayed red curtains, cast harsh shadows across her face. This wasn’t the grand stage she had dreamed of as a child, belting out show tunes in her bedroom mirror. But it was hers tonight.

Eliza took a deep breath, silencing the nervous tremor in her chest. The few patrons scattered around the room – a pair of weary truck drivers nursing beers, a lone woman hunched over a crossword puzzle – turned their gaze towards her. It wasn't a crowd, not by any stretch, but they were here. They were listening. And that was enough for now.

She closed her eyes, letting the melody flow through her veins. This song, a bluesy ballad about lost love and second chances, resonated deep within her soul.
