Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already desolate view of industrial rooftops and overflowing gutters. Inside, Eloise Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, meticulously adjusted the height of a parallel bar system. The clink of metal on metal echoed through the cavernous therapy room, momentarily drowning out the mournful drone of the city outside. 

Eloise wasn't fazed by the dreary weather. She thrived on these days, when the world felt muted and withdrawn, leaving her to focus solely on the task at hand â€“ helping her patients reclaim their lives, piece by painstaking piece. Today's patient, a young man named Daniel who'd suffered a debilitating stroke, was anxiously awaiting his turn. Eloise knew that beneath his apprehension lay a fierce determination to walk again, and she was determined to be the one to help him achieve it.
