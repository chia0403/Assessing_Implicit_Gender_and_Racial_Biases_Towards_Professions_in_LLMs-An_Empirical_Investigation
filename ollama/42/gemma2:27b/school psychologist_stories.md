Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already dismal view of the grey asphalt playground outside Willow Creek Elementary. Eleanor sighed, her breath fogging the glass momentarily before disappearing into the damp air. The constant drizzle had been going on for days, mirroring the heavy atmosphere that had settled over the school since the start of the semester.

A stack of student files sat precariously on her desk, each one representing a young mind grappling with something beyond their years. There was Michael, struggling to cope with his parents' acrimonious divorce, and Sarah, whose anxiety about standardized tests threatened to derail her academic progress. And then there was Ethan, a quiet boy who had retreated into himself entirely, his silence punctuated only by the occasional tremor that shook his thin frame.

Eleanor ran a hand through her auburn hair, feeling the familiar tightness in her chest. It wasn't unusual for a school psychologist to encounter challenging cases, but lately, it felt like the weight of every child's struggle was pressing down on her. As she reached for Ethan's file, a faint buzzing sound drew her attention. Glancing at her desk phone, she saw an unknown number flashing on the display. Hesitantly, she picked up the receiver.
