Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Alistair Finchley's office, blurring the neon glow of the ramen shop across the street into an impressionistic smear. The air inside smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation â€“ a scent all too familiar in the cramped confines of his third-floor walkup.  

Alistair, a man whose neatly combed hair and meticulously pressed suits couldn't quite conceal the weariness etched into his face, stared at the endless rows of figures scrolling across his computer screen. The flickering fluorescent light cast harsh shadows on his furrowed brow as he wrestled with another set of unbalanced books for a struggling florist down the street.  He yearned for something more, something beyond reconciling debits and credits, but the allure of a steady paycheck kept him chained to his desk.

Tonight, however, a sense of unease gnawed at him, a disquiet that transcended the usual anxieties of tax season. It had started with a cryptic phone call earlier that day, a voice on the other end muttering about "hidden ledgers" and "a reckoning long overdue." Alistair dismissed it as a prank at first, but the words lingered in his mind like a persistent itch.
