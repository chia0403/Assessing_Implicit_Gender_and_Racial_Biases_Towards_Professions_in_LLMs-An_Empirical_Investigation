The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and hairspray, a familiar comfort to Eloise Marie Beaumont. Sunlight streamed through the arched window of her salon, "Eloise's Emporium," illuminating motes of dust dancing in its path. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Montmartre buzzed with life – street vendors hawking their wares, artists sketching portraits on weathered easels, and couples strolling hand-in-hand, lost in their own world. But inside Eloise's Emporium, time seemed to slow down. 

Eloise, her auburn curls pulled back in a neat bun, carefully trimmed the split ends of Madame Dupont’s hair, her nimble fingers working with practiced ease. Madame Dupont, a regular customer and beloved gossip, regaled Eloise with tales of the latest scandal brewing amongst the artists in the neighborhood.  Eloise listened intently, her smile warm and genuine, but her mind was elsewhere. A letter lay unopened on her counter, its stark white envelope mocking her with its mystery. It had arrived that morning, bearing no return address and a single, cryptic word scrawled across the front: "Return." 

A shiver ran down Eloise's spine, for she knew exactly what it meant. The past, a ghost she had thought buried forever, was about to resurface.
