The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the colorful alphabet carpet sprawled across Miss Eloise Beaumont's classroom. It was 7:45 AM, fifteen minutes before the floodgates would open and unleash twenty-five pint-sized tornadoes upon her carefully curated world of glitter glue and finger paints. Eloise nervously smoothed down her floral dress, the scent of cinnamon buns from the school cafeteria already wafting in through the slightly ajar door. Today was Picture Day, and while she'd diligently prepped the little ones with practice smiles and "cheese!" commands, a gnawing sense of dread churned in her stomach. 

Last year's picture day had been a disaster: Timmy Thompson had a full-blown meltdown over a missing dinosaur sticker, Sarah Jenkins tripped and landed face-first in a bowl of goldfish crackers, and the class hamster, Mr. Nibbles, decided to make a daring escape during the photographer's arrival. Eloise shuddered at the memory. This year, she vowed, would be different.

But as the first bell clanged through the hallway, signaling the imminent arrival of her students, Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that chaos was lurking just beyond the brightly painted door.
