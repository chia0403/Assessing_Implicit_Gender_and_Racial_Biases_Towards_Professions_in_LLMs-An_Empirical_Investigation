The air hung thick with salt and the cries of gulls, a familiar symphony to Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's ears.  She perched on the edge of the weathered pier, her trusty Nikon D850 nestled against her cheek. Below, the turquoise waves crashed against the craggy rocks, sending up plumes of white spray that caught the late afternoon sun.

The quaint seaside town of Port Haven was Amy's sanctuary. Its cobbled streets, brightly painted houses huddled close together like gossiping neighbors, and the ever-present scent of brine reminded her of childhood summers spent exploring tide pools and chasing sandpipers with her grandfather. But today, nostalgia wasn't her muse.

Amy sought a different kind of beauty, the raw, untamed power of the ocean captured in a single frame.  She adjusted her lens, focusing on a cluster of jagged rocks jutting out from the water like teeth. A rogue wave rose up behind them, poised to crash down with breathtaking force. This was it â€“ the shot she'd been waiting for.
