The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Hawthorne's neck as he wrestled with a stubborn beam. Sweat trickled down his forehead, stinging his eyes. The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of sawdust, concrete, and exhaust fumes - the symphony of progress echoing through the skeletal frame of the new apartment complex.

Eli squinted, trying to line up the beam with its counterpart on the opposite side. It was always a struggle, this balancing act between brute force and precision. One wrong move could send tons of lumber crashing down, a risk Eli wasn't willing to take. He grunted, shifting his weight and heaving with all his might. The beam finally slotted into place, groaning in protest.

He wiped his brow with the back of his hand, a weary smile tugging at his lips. Another small victory in the ongoing battle against gravity. But even as he celebrated this minor triumph, a knot of anxiety tightened in his chest. Today was payday, and Eli knew it wouldn't be enough to cover the rent, let alone the mountain of medical bills piling up on his kitchen table.
