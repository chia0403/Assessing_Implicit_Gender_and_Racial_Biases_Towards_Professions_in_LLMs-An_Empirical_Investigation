The stench of mildew and stale urine hung heavy in the air, clinging to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' overalls like a stubborn barnacle. He grimaced, wishing for the hundredth time that he'd chosen carpentry instead. At least carpenters got to work with fresh wood and sunshine. Bart, on the other hand, was knee-deep in the guts of Mrs. Periwinkle's century-old Victorian plumbing system, a labyrinthine network of corroded pipes groaning under the weight of forgotten years.

The house itself, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the perpetually fog-shrouded San Francisco Bay, seemed to mirror Bart's current mood â€“ tired, creaky, and desperately in need of an overhaul. The faded floral wallpaper peeled from damp walls, revealing patches of crumbling plaster beneath.  A single ray of sunlight pierced through a grimy windowpane, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like ghostly ballerinas. 

Bart sighed, reaching for his trusty pipe wrench. He knew this wouldn't be an easy fix. Old houses held their secrets tight, whispering tales of forgotten lives and buried plumbing nightmares.
