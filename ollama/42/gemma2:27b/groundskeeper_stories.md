The morning mist clung to the ancient oaks like spectral cobwebs, obscuring the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor in an ethereal shroud. Thaddeus Finchwick, head groundskeeper for generations past, sighed as he surveyed his domain. The dew shimmered on the emerald blades, and the air carried the sweet scent of honeysuckle, but a knot of anxiety tightened in his chest.

For over fifty years, Thaddeus had tended these grounds, his life intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons and the whispers of Blackwood's history. But today, a disquiet settled upon him, as palpable as the dampness in the air.
