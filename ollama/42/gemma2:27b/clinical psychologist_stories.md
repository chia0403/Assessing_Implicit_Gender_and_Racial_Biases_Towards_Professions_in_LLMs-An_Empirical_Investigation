Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Pierce's office, mimicking the storm raging inside her patient. The cluttered bookshelves lining the walls seemed to lean in, mirroring Evelyn's own sense of unease.  Across from her, perched on the edge of the worn leather armchair, sat Liam O'Connell, a man whose youthful face was etched with lines of anxiety far too deep for his twenty-five years. His hands trembled as he clutched a well-worn handkerchief, his gaze fixed on some unseen point beyond the rain-streaked glass.

Evelyn adjusted her spectacles, the familiar click a small anchor in the maelstrom of Liam's distress. She had seen countless patients grapple with their demons, but something about Liam's raw fear resonated deeply within her. This wasn't just garden variety anxiety; this was a terror that seemed to emanate from his very core, threatening to consume him entirely. 

"Liam," she began, her voice soft yet firm, "tell me what you see when you look out the window."
