The insistent chime of the intercom jolted Rosalind "Rosie" Ainsworth from her daydream. She'd been picturing herself on a sun-drenched beach in Santorini, far away from the hushed opulence of The Grand Blackwood Hotel. Rosie smoothed down her crisp navy uniform and plastered a smile on her face as she answered, "Good evening, this is Rosie speaking, how may I assist you?" 

The lobby shimmered under the soft glow of crystal chandeliers, reflecting off the polished marble floor like scattered diamonds. A fire crackled merrily in the grand hearth, casting dancing shadows on the plush velvet armchairs arranged around a mahogany coffee table laden with antique books and porcelain vases overflowing with crimson roses. Outside, the relentless London drizzle hammered against the arched windows, but within The Grand Blackwood's walls, time seemed to stand still. It was Rosie's job to ensure that illusion remained unbroken for each of its discerning guests.

Tonight, however, a tremor of unease ran through her. A guest requesting assistance after midnight wasn't unusual, but the urgency in the voice on the intercom, laced with something akin to fear, sent a shiver down her spine.
