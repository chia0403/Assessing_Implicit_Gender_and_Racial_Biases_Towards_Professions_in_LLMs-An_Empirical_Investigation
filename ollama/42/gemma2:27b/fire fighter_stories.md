The siren’s wail sliced through Elias Blackwood’s dream, dragging him from a tranquil field of sunflowers to the harsh reality of his engine bay locker room. He jolted upright, heart already hammering a frantic rhythm against his ribs. Grabbing his helmet and gear, he sprinted towards the roar of the engine outside.  Smoke billowed on the horizon, staining the twilight sky an angry orange.

He lived for these moments, for the challenge and the chance to make a difference. Tonight, whatever inferno awaited them held his undivided attention.
