Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Evelyn Albright’s office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an unsettling glow on the stacks of college applications piled precariously on her desk. Outside, the autumn leaves swirled in a frenzied dance, mirroring the chaos she felt.  She was responsible for guiding these young minds towards their futures, but lately, it felt like she was steering a ship through a hurricane. 

Her office, tucked away in a quiet corner of Northwood High School, was usually a haven of calm. Posters adorned the walls: inspirational quotes about perseverance, colourful maps of universities across the country, and photographs of smiling graduates clutching their diplomas. Today, though, even the cheerful décor seemed to mock her mounting anxiety.

Evelyn sighed, running a hand through her auburn hair that had escaped its usual bun. The phone on her desk buzzed incessantly, each ring a reminder of the countless students depending on her guidance. But tonight, she wasn't sure if she had the answers anymore.
