The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and rosemary in Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins' shop. Dawn was just breaking over Butcher's Row, painting the cobblestone street a soft lavender, but Barty was already elbow-deep in pig innards, separating kidneys from lobes with practiced ease. He hummed along to the tune whistling through the cracked windowpane - an old sea shanty his grandfather used to sing.

His shop, Higgins & Sons, Butchering since 1842, was a comforting jumble of hanging carcasses, glistening cleavers, and worn wooden counters. It wasn't glamorous, but it was honest work, a legacy Barty carried with pride. He knew each cut of meat like an old friend, their textures, flavours, the best ways to prepare them. But this morning, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced beneath his skin, making him glance nervously at the shop door. The whispers had started again.
