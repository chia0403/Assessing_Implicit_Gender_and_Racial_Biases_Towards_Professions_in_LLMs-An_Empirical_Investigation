The humid air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and woodsmoke.  Beneath the relentless midday sun, the ancient city of Hue shimmered like a mirage. Elodie Nguyen adjusted her conical hat, its woven bamboo offering meager shade against the unrelenting heat. Sweat trickled down her temple, but she plastered on a bright smile as the tour group shuffled behind her, their cameras clicking incessantly.

"And here," Elodie announced, gesturing towards a crumbling stone archway overgrown with bougainvillea, "we stand at the entrance to the Imperial Citadel, the once-mighty heart of Nguyen dynasty rule."  She paused, letting the weight of history settle upon the group. "For centuries, emperors walked these very paths..." 

Elodie's voice trailed off as a shiver ran down her spine. The air seemed to thicken, charged with an unseen energy. Her eyes darted towards a dilapidated pavilion hidden amongst the overgrown foliage â€“ a place she normally steered clear of on her tours. Today, however, something compelled her towards it.
