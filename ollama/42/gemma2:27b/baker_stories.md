The aroma of burnt sugar clung to Elsie Mae Davenport's apron like a mischievous ghost.  It was the smell of failure, a bitter reminder that even her most beloved recipe, Granny Rose's Pecan Sticky Buns, could betray her on occasion.

Dawn was just beginning to paint streaks of pale pink across the sky as Elsie surveyed the blackened remains in her oven.  The quaint bakery, "Sweet Surrender," nestled in the heart of Harmony Creek, a town so small its population barely tipped the scales at 500 souls, was silent except for the ticking of the antique clock on the wall and the low hum of the refrigerator.

Elsie sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear.  Harmony Creek wasn't exactly known for its culinary sophistication; most folks were content with their biscuits and gravy. But Elsie dreamed bigger. She envisioned delicate Ã©clairs, towering croquembouches, and flaky croissants that would transport her customers to the Parisian streets she'd only read about in books.

Today, though, all she had was a sticky mess and a dwindling supply of pecans. The annual Harmony Creek Pie Contest was looming, and Elsie, determined to win for the third year running, knew she needed a showstopper.
