The incessant chirping of the heart monitor grated on Elara Josephine Hayes’ nerves like sandpaper.  She glanced at the frail figure in the bed, his chest rising and falling with each shallow breath, a symphony played on weary lungs. The fluorescent lights of St. Jude's General Hospital cast long, skeletal shadows across the room, amplifying the sense of sterile vulnerability that permeated every corner. Elara smoothed the thin sheet over Mr. Henderson's bony frame, her touch gentle but firm. He was losing his battle, she knew it as surely as she knew her own name.  

But tonight, there was a tightness in her chest that went beyond professional empathy. It felt personal, a premonition whispering on the wind that carried through the cracked windowpane. Elara glanced at the clock ticking away on the wall – 2:17 am. Something wasn't right.
