The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his skin the colour of ripe tomatoes. He wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smear of grime that mirrored the dusty landscape around him. Eli squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him, shimmering in the midday heat. He was part of a three-man crew tasked with repairing a stretch of Highway 17, a lonely artery that snaked through the Nevada desert.

The air hung heavy and still, punctuated only by the rhythmic drone of cicadas and the occasional mournful howl of a distant coyote. Eli tapped his steel-toed boots against the cracked asphalt, listening for the hollow thud that indicated a deeper problem beneath the surface. Today's job was simple enough â€“ patching potholes and smoothing out rough patches. But the monotonous work felt like an endless loop, mirroring the desolate expanse around him. 


Eli longed for something more, a break from the scorching sun and the relentless hum of traffic. He yearned for the cool shade of mountains, the rush of wind through his hair as he rode his battered motorcycle, and the comforting company of his family back in Reno.

But for now, he was tethered to this stretch of highway, another cog in the machine of endless maintenance.
