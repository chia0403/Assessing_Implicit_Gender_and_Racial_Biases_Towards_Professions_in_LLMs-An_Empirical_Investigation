The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, a sickly sweet counterpoint to the sharp tang of acetone.  A chipped ceramic poodle, missing its right ear and sporting a jaunty pink bow, sat on the windowsill overlooking Elm Street. Sunlight glinted off the rows of rainbow-hued bottles lined up like tiny soldiers, reflecting onto the manicured nails of Eloise Beatrice "Ellie" Beaumont. She was humming along to a forgotten 80s pop song, her fingers expertly shaping an almond nail with a delicate rosewood buffer.  

Outside, Elm Street buzzed with the usual Saturday morning activity: Mrs. Higgins' chihuahua yipping furiously from its carrier, teenagers skateboarding down the sidewalk, and the rhythmic thud of Mr. Henderson hammering away at his endless home renovations. 

But inside Ellie's little salon, "Ellie's Elegant Escapes," a different kind of drama was about to unfold. The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of a customer unlike any Ellie had seen before.
