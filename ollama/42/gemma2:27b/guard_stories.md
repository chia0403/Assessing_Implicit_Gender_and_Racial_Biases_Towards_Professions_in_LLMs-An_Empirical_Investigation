The biting wind whipped across Elara’s face, carrying with it the scent of salt and decay. It was always like this on the Isle of Whispers, a perpetual twilight veiled by swirling grey mists that clung to the crumbling stone walls like spectral cobwebs. Elara Thorne, her knuckles white against the cold iron railing of the watchtower, stared out at the churning sea below. 

Her post was lonely, as were all posts on the Isle. Centuries ago, Whispers had been a bustling port, a jewel of trade and culture nestled in the heart of the Azure Sea. Now, it was a forgotten relic, its once grand buildings reduced to skeletal husks haunted by whispers of a forgotten past.  

Elara shifted her weight, her gaze sweeping across the desolate landscape. The only sound was the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead and the relentless crash of waves against the jagged cliffs. Her duty was simple: watch for any ships approaching the forbidden shore. But no ship dared venture near Whispers anymore. Legends spoke of curses and creatures lurking in the shadows, waiting to snatch unsuspecting souls into the abyss. Elara had heard them all – tales whispered by grizzled sailors and fearful townsfolk. Yet, she remained vigilant, a solitary sentinel against an unseen threat. 


What will Elara see first? What secrets does the Isle of Whispers hold?
