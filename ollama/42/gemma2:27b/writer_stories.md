Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the chaotic drumbeat in Elara Blackwood's chest. Her fingers hovered over the worn keys of her grandfather's typewriter, the ancient machine as stubborn as her muse tonight. The attic studio, crammed with dusty trunks and stacks of forgotten novels, pulsed with a melancholic energy. Outside, the wind howled through the gnarled branches of the ancient oak that clawed at the side of Blackwood Manor, casting long, skeletal shadows across the rain-slicked lawn. Elara sighed, her breath fogging the glass. Three days she'd been staring at the blank page, the weight of a deadline pressing down on her like a physical burden. She needed inspiration, something to ignite the spark that had dimmed within her creative soul. But tonight, all she felt was the gnawing emptiness of writer's block and the chilling loneliness of the storm-wracked manor.
