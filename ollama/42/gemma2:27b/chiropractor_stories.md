Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Alistair Finch's practice, blurring the world outside into a watercolour wash of greys and greens. The rhythmic thump-thump of droplets echoed the insistent ache in Alistair's lower back.  Irony wasn't lost on him â€“ a chiropractor struggling with his own alignment. He sighed, massaging the knot that had taken root between his shoulder blades. His practice, nestled in the quaint, historic district of Oakhaven, was usually abuzz with activity by this hour, but today, the storm seemed to have kept everyone indoors. 

The silence, broken only by the ticking clock on the wall and the occasional crackle from the aging fireplace, pressed down on him like a heavy blanket. Alistair longed for the familiar clink of his adjusting table, the soft groan of relief from a patient's sore back, anything to break the monotonous quiet.  He glanced at the overflowing appointment book - a testament to Oakhaven's trust in his healing touch. But today, it felt like an indictment of his own stillness.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled him out of his reverie.
