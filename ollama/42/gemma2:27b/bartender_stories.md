The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting an unsteady purple glow onto the rain-slicked cobblestones. Inside, The Rusty Mug was a haven from the storm, the air thick with the scent of spilled beer and woodsmoke. Elias Blackwood, his salt-and-pepper beard catching the dim light, expertly slid a pint across the worn mahogany bar to a burly dockworker.

"That'll be three shillings, Mick," Elias said, his voice gruff but warm. 

Mick grunted in acknowledgement, tossing a few coins onto the counter before turning back to the flickering telly mounted above the fireplace, where a grainy image of King George VI flickered across the screen. 


Elias wiped down the bar with a practiced hand, his mind wandering as he listened to the low murmur of conversation and the clinking of glasses. He'd seen a lot in his years behind the counter - sailors spinning yarns of distant shores, lovers sharing clandestine glances over stolen kisses, men drowning their sorrows in amber liquid. But tonight, something felt different. A shiver ran down Elias's spine as he caught sight of a figure silhouetted against the rain-streaked window. The figure was tall and cloaked, its face obscured by shadow. It stood motionless, seemingly staring directly at Elias.
