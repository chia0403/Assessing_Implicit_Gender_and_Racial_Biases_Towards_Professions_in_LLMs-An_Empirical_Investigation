Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' cramped cubicle. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cluttered drafting table where Bart hunched, his brow furrowed in concentration. His calloused fingers traced the lines of a blueprint for a new suspension bridge, each precise stroke of his pencil translating abstract calculations into tangible form.

The air in the drafty office was thick with the smell of old coffee and stale cigarettes. The rhythmic clatter of keyboards mingled with the occasional exasperated sigh from overworked colleagues, creating a symphony of urban drudgery. Outside, the city groaned under the weight of the downpour, its neon signs blurring into streaks of shimmering color against the charcoal sky. 


Bart's stomach grumbled, reminding him he hadn't eaten anything since breakfast â€“ a hastily devoured bagel and lukewarm coffee. He was on deadline, though, and couldn't afford to lose focus. The future of this bridge, a crucial artery connecting two burgeoning districts, rested on his shoulders.

But tonight, something felt different. A gnawing unease lingered at the edges of Bart's awareness. It wasn't just the relentless rain or the ever-present deadline pressure. There was a subtle shift in the atmosphere, a prickling sensation that whispered of hidden dangers lurking beneath the surface of his mundane reality.
