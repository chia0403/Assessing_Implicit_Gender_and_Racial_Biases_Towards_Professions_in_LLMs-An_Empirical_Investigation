The air in Benny "Greasemonkey" Grimaldi's garage was thick with the scent of gasoline, hot oil, and desperation.  Benny wiped a smudge of grease from his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, squinting at the sputtering engine of Mrs. O’Malley’s 1987 Buick Regal. The late afternoon sun slanted through the grimy windows, casting long shadows across the workbench littered with wrenches, spark plugs, and half-eaten sandwiches. Outside, the rumble of traffic on Route 66 provided a constant backdrop to Benny's solitary struggle.

Benny was known in his small New Mexico town as the man who could coax life out of any clunker, but Mrs. O'Malley's Buick seemed determined to defy him. She needed it running for her granddaughter’s wedding that weekend, and Benny, despite his gruff exterior and perpetual scowl, had a soft spot for old ladies and weddings.  He just hoped he could pull this miracle off before time ran out.
