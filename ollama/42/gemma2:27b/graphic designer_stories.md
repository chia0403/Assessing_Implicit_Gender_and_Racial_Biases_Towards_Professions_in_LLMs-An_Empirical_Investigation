Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Eloise Beaumont's studio apartment, blurring the glittering cityscape below into an impressionistic swirl of lights. A half-eaten bowl of ramen sat precariously on her desk, its steam swallowed by the chill emanating from the windowpanes. Eloise, usually a vibrant burst of color in her eclectic wardrobe, was draped in a grey hoodie, her fiery red hair pulled back in a messy bun.  

She stared at the screen, frustration twisting her features. The logo she'd been painstakingly crafting for weeks – a stylized phoenix rising from flames for a new tech start-up – felt lifeless, generic. It lacked the spark, the audacity that defined Eloise's work. 

The deadline loomed, casting a long shadow over her creative block.  Eloise needed inspiration, something to jolt her out of this dreary rut. But with the storm raging outside and a gnawing emptiness in her stomach, she doubted even a triple espresso could do the trick.
