Rain lashed against the windowpane of Elmwood Dental Clinic, blurring the view of Maple Street into an Impressionist painting. The rhythmic drumming was punctuated by the insistent ringing of the clinic's phone. Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Hawthorne sighed, pushing aside her clipboard and reaching for the receiver.

The familiar scent of disinfectant hung in the air, tinged with a faint sweetness from the lavender hand sanitizer Ellie religiously applied. Her work station, meticulously organized with neatly sharpened instruments and color-coded floss, reflected her methodical personality. Outside, the grey November sky mirrored her mood. 

Ellie wasn't fond of Mondays, especially rainy ones like this. Today felt particularly heavy, a sense of unease settling in her stomach that had nothing to do with last night's questionable burrito. The phone continued its insistent ringing, reminding her that the day had only just begun.
