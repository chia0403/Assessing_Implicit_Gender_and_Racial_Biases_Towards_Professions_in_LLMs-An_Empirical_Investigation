Rain lashed against the windowpane of Elara Hawthorne's studio, a rhythmic counterpoint to the soft chimes tinkling near the entrance. The scent of lavender oil and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, attempting to mask the faint mustiness that always seemed to linger despite Elara's best efforts. Outside, the storm raged on, turning the cobblestone streets of Prague into treacherous rivers.

Elara sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  She glanced at the clock, its ornate hands frozen at 6:15 pm. Her last appointment had cancelled just an hour ago, citing the inclement weather. The disappointment was familiar; business had been slow ever since she'd moved her practice from the bustling heart of the city to this quieter, more bohemian neighbourhood in Mala Strana.  

But Elara believed in her space. Nestled on a narrow street overlooking the Vltava River, it exuded a tranquility that felt worlds away from the tourist throngs and neon lights just a few blocks away. She'd poured her heart and soul into creating a sanctuary for healing, a place where weary souls could find solace and rejuvenation through touch. 

Tonight, however, that solace seemed elusive.  As Elara straightened the cushion on her massage table, the faint sound of knocking reached her ears. It was barely audible over the storm's roar, but it sparked a flicker of curiosity within her.
