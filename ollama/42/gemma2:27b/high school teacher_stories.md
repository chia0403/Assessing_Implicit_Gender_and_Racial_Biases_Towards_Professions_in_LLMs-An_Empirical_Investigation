The late afternoon sun bled through the dusty windows of Ms. Eleanor Cavendish's classroom, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor. The air hung heavy with the scent of chalk dust and teenage angst, a familiar cocktail that Eleanor had come to both tolerate and, strangely, appreciate. Outside, the bustling streets of Chicago hummed with the energy of rush hour, but within these four walls, time seemed to slow, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the old clock on the wall.

Eleanor leaned against her desk, a mountain of ungraded essays looming before her.  She sighed, rubbing tired eyes. The bell had just rung, signaling the end of another exhausting day trying to instill a love of Shakespeare into teenagers who would rather be scrolling through TikTok. Today's lesson on "Romeo and Juliet" had been met with predictable groans and rolled eyes.
