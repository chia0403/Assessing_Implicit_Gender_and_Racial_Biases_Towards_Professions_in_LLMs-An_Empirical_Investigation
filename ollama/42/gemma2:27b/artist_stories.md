The air in Eloise Beaumont's attic studio crackled with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine. Dust motes danced in the shaft of late afternoon sunlight that pierced through the grimy skylight, illuminating the chaos of half-finished canvases leaning against the walls. Eloise, her paint-stained fingers nimble as sparrows, meticulously dabbed crimson onto a sunflower petal, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the cacophony of Paris – the rumble of trams, the hawkers' cries, the lilting melody of an accordion – faded into a distant hum, drowned out by the symphony playing within her soul. 

Today, however, the familiar rhythm felt off-kilter. The vibrant yellows and oranges she usually wielded with such confidence seemed muted, lacking their characteristic vibrancy. A disquiet gnawed at Eloise's heart, an unsettling premonition that something was about to change.
