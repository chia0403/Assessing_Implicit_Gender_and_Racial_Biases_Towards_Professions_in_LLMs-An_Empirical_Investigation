Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's office, mimicking the turbulent emotions churning within her patient. The worn, leather armchair squeaked ominously with every shift of Elias Thorne's weight, a sound that grated on Amy's already frayed nerves. Outside, the city lights blurred into shimmering streaks through the relentless downpour, casting an ethereal glow across the cluttered bookshelves lining her office walls.

Amy's gaze softened as she watched Elias, his normally vibrant green eyes dulled with despair. His hands, calloused from years of carpentry, trembled slightly as he gripped the frayed edges of a faded photograph.  A bittersweet smile tugged at Amy's lips. Elias was a man sculpted by hardship and loss, yet his inherent kindness shone through even in his darkest hour. Today, she knew, he needed her guidance more than ever.

The antique grandfather clock in the corner chimed five times, its solemn toll echoing the weight of the unspoken words hanging heavy in the air. Amy leaned forward, her empathy a tangible presence in the room. "Elias," she began softly, her voice a soothing balm amidst the storm raging both inside and out.  "Tell me what's troubling you."
