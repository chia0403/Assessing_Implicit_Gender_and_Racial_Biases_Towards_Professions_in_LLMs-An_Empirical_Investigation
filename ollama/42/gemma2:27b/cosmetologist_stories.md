The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly green glow on the rows of hair dye bottles lining the wall. The air was thick with the scent of perm solution and lavender shampoo, a fragrance Evelyn Rose Dubois had come to associate with both comfort and frustration. Today, it leaned more towards frustration. 

Evelyn, with her perfectly coiffed auburn bob and emerald green eyes that sparkled with mischief even when faced with adversity, surveyed the scene before her with a sigh. Her salon, "Evelyn's Enchanted Styles," wasn't exactly bustling. In fact, it was practically deserted. The only client she had all morning, Mrs. Higgins, had just left, complaining that her silver highlights were "too silver" and demanding a refund.

Evelyn glanced at the clock. It was barely past noon.  She still had a mountain of paperwork to catch up on, a delivery of new styling products arriving this afternoon, and a meeting with the landlord looming over her like a dark cloud. Perhaps she should have stuck to being a librarian like her mother had suggested.

But no. Evelyn Rose Dubois had always been drawn to the transformative power of beauty, the way a well-placed curl or a splash of colour could change someone's entire outlook on life.  She just needed a miracle, and maybe a good cup of coffee, to get through this day.
