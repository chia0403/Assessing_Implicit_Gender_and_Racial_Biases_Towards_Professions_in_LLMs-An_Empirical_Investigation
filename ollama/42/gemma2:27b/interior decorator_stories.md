Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Blackwood's studio, mimicking the tempest brewing within her. Stacks of fabric swatches lay abandoned on her worktable, their vibrant hues dulled by the gloom that had settled over her. The scent of cedarwood and bergamot from her diffuser did little to soothe her frayed nerves.  Amelia stared at the blueprints for the Hawthorne Manor renovation, a grand project that should have been her magnum opus. But now, it felt like an insurmountable mountain looming before her, each detail a treacherous crevice threatening to send her tumbling down.

The manor itself was a relic of a bygone era, a sprawling Victorian mansion perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the rugged Cornish coast. Its bones were good – sturdy granite walls and soaring ceilings – but its soul had been neglected for far too long. Amelia had envisioned restoring it to its former glory, weaving together modern elegance with its timeless charm.

But reality was proving to be a harsh critic. The client, a distant descendant of the original owners, was notoriously difficult, constantly changing his mind about every detail, from the wallpaper pattern to the placement of the grandfather clock. Amelia's normally boundless creativity felt stifled, her passion for the project waning with each passing day.
