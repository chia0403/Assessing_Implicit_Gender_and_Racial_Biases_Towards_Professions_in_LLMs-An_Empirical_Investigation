Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's office, blurring the already faded cityscape beyond. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and despair – a fitting aroma for a Tuesday afternoon in the bowels of the Leviathan Insurance building. Teddy, his tie askew and hair perpetually ruffled like autumn leaves, stared morosely at the stack of claims piling up on his desk. Each one represented another shattered dream, another life thrown into disarray by the capricious whims of fate.

He wasn't sure when his idealism had curdled into this bitter cynicism, but it felt like a slow poison seeping through him, drop by agonizing drop.  

Today, however, promised something different. A new client was due in any minute, someone with a claim so unusual it had been flagged for Teddy's attention personally.  A shiver of anticipation – the first he'd felt in months – ran down his spine. Perhaps this case would be the spark he needed to reignite the flame of hope flickering precariously within him.

Or maybe it was just another Tuesday, destined to drown him further in the mire of misery and paperwork. Only time, and a knock on the door, would tell.
