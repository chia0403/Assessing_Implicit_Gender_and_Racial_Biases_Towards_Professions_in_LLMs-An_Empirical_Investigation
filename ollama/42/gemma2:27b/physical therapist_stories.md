The incessant hum of the fluorescent lights overhead buzzed in Eliza Bethany Thorne's ears, competing with the rhythmic squeak of her patient's wheelchair.  Eliza adjusted the weight on the parallel bars, her brow furrowed in concentration as Mr. Hernandez hesitantly shifted his weight, his face a mask of strained effort. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly, turning the already stifling air inside the clinic thick and heavy. 

Eliza worked in a small, independent physiotherapy practice nestled in the heart of Phoenix, a world away from the sterile, high-tech hospitals she'd envisioned herself working in during her university days. The peeling paint on the walls, the mismatched chairs, and the ever-present scent of antiseptic weren't exactly glamorous, but Eliza had grown to appreciate the warmth and intimacy of this little haven.
