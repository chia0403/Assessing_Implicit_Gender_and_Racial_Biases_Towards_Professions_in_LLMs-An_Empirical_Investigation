The aroma of stale crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent to Penelope Evergreen, third-grade teacher extraordinaire at Willow Creek Elementary. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating rows of pint-sized desks adorned with misspelled names and haphazardly glued glitter.  Penelope surveyed her domain, a battlefield littered with crumpled worksheets, forgotten lunchboxes, and rogue Play-Doh creatures. A faint hum of anticipation vibrated through the classroom as students fidgeted in their seats, eager for the start of the school day. Today was special; it was "Show and Tell" day, and Penelope had no doubt that Willow Creek's third graders would deliver a spectacle of epic proportions.
