The rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Elias "Eli" Blackwood's office, mimicking the incessant throb in his temple. The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting an unsettling green glow across the threadbare carpet and stacks of dusty case files. Eli rubbed his weary eyes, the stench of stale coffee and cigarette smoke clinging to him like a second skin. He was knee-deep in another dead-end case - a missing poodle with more personality quirks than sense â€“ when the door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a figure shrouded in shadow.

The newcomer paused just inside the threshold, their silhouette framed against the sickly green light. "Mr. Blackwood?" The voice was low and gravelly, laced with an accent Eli couldn't quite place.

Eli straightened in his chair, suspicion prickling his skin. This wasn't the usual clientele he attracted - bored housewives looking for runaway hamsters or paranoid businessmen convinced their rivals were tapping their phones. Something about this visitor felt different, dangerous even.
