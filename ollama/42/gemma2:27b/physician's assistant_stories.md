The humid air hung heavy in Savannah, Georgia, even at dusk. Cicadas droned their insistent chorus from the Spanish moss-draped live oaks lining Jones Street. Amelia "Amy" Beaumont adjusted her stethoscope and sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow with the back of her hand.  She was exhausted. A twelve-hour shift at Mercy Hospital's ER had left her physically and emotionally drained. 

Tonight, instead of retreating to the quiet solitude of her apartment, Amy found herself drawn towards the rhythmic clinking of glasses and lively chatter emanating from a dimly lit bar called The Grey Owl. She needed a drink, maybe two. And perhaps a distraction from the endless stream of injuries, illnesses, and anxieties she'd faced all day.  


As she pushed open the heavy wooden door, the warm light and jazzy melody washed over her like a comforting embrace. For a moment, the weight of the world lifted from her shoulders. She was just Amy, not Dr. Beaumont's right hand, not the savior in scrubs, but simply a woman craving a respite from the storm.
