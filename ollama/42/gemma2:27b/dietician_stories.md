Rain lashed against the bakery windowpane, blurring the twinkle lights strung across the awning into an impressionistic smear of gold. Inside, the air was thick with the aroma of yeast and cinnamon, a comforting counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Eleanor Rosalind Finch, RD, sighed as she surveyed the nearly empty cafe.  Her appointment with Mrs. Petrov, scheduled for 2:00 p.m., was already ten minutes late.

Eleanor wasn't just any dietician; she specialized in helping people reclaim their relationship with food after trauma. She believed that nourishment shouldn't be a source of guilt or fear, and her cozy cafe, "The Nourished Soul," was designed to feel like a safe haven. Today, however, the storm seemed to be mirroring the turmoil within Eleanor herself.  She hadn't slept well since receiving an anonymous email threatening to expose a secret from her past - a secret she thought she had buried forever.

As the cafe door chimed open, Eleanor straightened her floral blouse and plastered on a welcoming smile. A woman with tired eyes and a hesitant smile entered, clutching a worn leather handbag. "Eleanor?" she asked, her voice raspy.  "I'm Mrs. Petrov."
