Rain lashed against the pharmacy window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an indecipherable smear. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth meticulously counted out twenty-four 500mg ibuprofen tablets, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of rain mingled with the soft hiss of the air conditioner and the faint chirping of crickets from a potted plant forgotten in the corner.

But tonight, the storm seemed to have kept everyone indoors. The silence, broken only by the occasional rumble of thunder, felt heavy, almost oppressive.

Tonight was the anniversary of her father's passing, and the loneliness felt sharper than usual. She missed his booming laugh, his warm embrace, and his sage advice, especially tonight when the world seemed to be echoing the storm raging inside her.
