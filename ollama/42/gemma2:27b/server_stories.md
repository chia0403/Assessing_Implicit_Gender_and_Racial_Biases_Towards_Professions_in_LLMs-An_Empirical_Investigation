The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and cheap cologne.  Neon lights flickered over the red vinyl booths, casting an unsettling glow on the sticky linoleum floor. It was Friday night at The Rusty Mug, and Elara Finch was already bracing herself for the inevitable chaos.  

Elara, a petite girl with fiery red hair perpetually escaping its braid, balanced a tray laden with greasy burgers and lukewarm fries. Her smile, practiced to perfection over years of dealing with demanding customers, barely reached her weary blue eyes. 

Tonight felt different, though. A strange energy crackled in the air, making the hairs on Elara's arms stand on end.  As she navigated through the throngs of regulars and boisterous newcomers, she couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to happen.
