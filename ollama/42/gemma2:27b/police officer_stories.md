Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Precinct 42, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Detective Silas Blackwood's already frayed nerves. The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows across the rain-slicked asphalt. It was past midnight in this forgotten corner of New Orleans, and the air hung thick with humidity and the cloying scent of jasmine struggling to bloom amidst the urban decay.

Blackwood rubbed his tired eyes, the harsh fluorescent light above doing little to banish the weariness that clung to him like a second skin.  He stared at the file on his desk - another homicide, another dead end. This city, he thought grimly, was drowning in its own darkness.
