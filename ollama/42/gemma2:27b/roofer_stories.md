The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he wrestled with a stubborn shingle. He grunted, sweat stinging his eyes, and finally coaxed it into place, securing it with a satisfying clink of the hammer. Below him, the bustling city of New Haven unfolded like a crumpled map. Sirens wailed, car horns honked, and the distant shouts of children playing echoed through the humid air. Eli barely noticed. His focus was on the roof, on the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer, on the satisfaction of transforming a dilapidated structure into something solid and new.

This particular job, however, felt different. The house, an ornate Victorian with peeling paint and overgrown ivy, seemed to hold secrets in its shadowed eaves and cracked windows. Eli had a feeling there was more to this renovation than met the eye.
