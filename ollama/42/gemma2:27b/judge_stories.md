The late afternoon sun bled through the stained-glass windows of the courtroom, casting fragmented rainbows across Judge Evelyn Rosalind Cartwright’s face. Dust motes danced in the golden beams, mimicking the nervous flutter in her stomach. Today was different. Today wasn't about petty theft or broken leases. Today, she would preside over a case that had gripped the city – a murder trial with whispers of political corruption and hidden agendas swirling around it like a storm cloud. 

Evelyn adjusted her spectacles, their familiar weight grounding her amidst the mounting tension. The courtroom, usually abuzz with hushed conversations, was eerily quiet, save for the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. She took a deep breath, reminding herself that justice wasn't served through emotions, but through careful consideration and adherence to the law.

The double doors creaked open, breaking the tense silence. Two figures entered – the defendant, pale and thin, his eyes fixed on the floor, and his defense attorney, a sharp-tongued woman with a reputation for winning impossible cases. Evelyn's gaze met theirs, a silent acknowledgement of the gravity of the situation before them. The trial was about to begin.
