The scent of cedar and sawdust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of sea salt drifting in from the nearby harbor. Elias Finnigan squinted through the morning sun filtering into his workshop, catching the glint off the plane he was meticulously sharpening. Outside, gulls shrieked their greetings to a new day, a counterpoint to the rhythmic rasp of steel on stone.  

Elias’ workshop wasn't much to look at: a humble, weather-beaten shed perched on the edge of Oakhaven, a sleepy fishing village nestled along the rugged Maine coast. But within its creaking walls and dusty floorboards, Elias transformed rough timber into works of art. He crafted sturdy furniture for fishermen's cottages, elegant toys for wide-eyed children, and intricate model ships that captured the essence of the seafaring life he’d always known but never lived.


Today, however, Elias wasn't crafting anything beautiful. He was wrestling with a stubborn piece of oak, its grain twisting against his will as he tried to carve it into the shape of a mermaid's tail for young Millie Peterson's birthday present.
