Rain lashed against the windows of Elsie Mae Davenport's cramped office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air. Outside, the neon sign of "Davenport Realty" blinked erratically, casting an sickly yellow glow onto the slick asphalt street below.

Elsie Mae, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun that mirrored the tension in her shoulders, stared at the stack of unsold listings piled precariously on her desk.  Six months. Six agonizing months since she'd hung her shingle, and not a single sale.  She'd poured her life savings into this dream - a quaint storefront office in the heart of Harmony Springs, a town where everyone knew your name (and your business).

But Harmony Springs was slowly drying up. Young families were fleeing to the city, leaving behind aging houses with peeling paint and overgrown gardens. Elsie Mae had tried everything: open houses, social media campaigns, even offering free pies to potential buyers. Nothing worked.

The phone remained stubbornly silent, a mocking reminder of her dwindling hopes. Today was different though. Today, a glimmer of possibility had appeared on her desk - a handwritten note requesting a showing for the old Victorian mansion on Willow Creek Lane.  Hope, fragile as a newborn butterfly, fluttered in Elsie Mae's chest. This could be it. This could be the break she needed.

With a deep breath and a determined glint in her hazel eyes, Elsie Mae grabbed her keys and stepped out into the deluge.
