The wind howled like a banshee outside, rattling the windows of Amelia "Ace" Blackwood's tiny cabin nestled high in the Alaskan mountains. Snow, whipped into a blinding frenzy by the gale, obscured the view beyond her porch, making the familiar peaks look like ghostly apparitions. Ace chewed on her lip, glancing nervously at the clock. It was past sunset, and the blizzard showed no signs of abating. Her flight to Anchorage was already delayed, and now it seemed impossible.

Ace wasn't one to shy away from a challenge. A seasoned bush pilot with years of experience navigating Alaska's treacherous terrain, she prided herself on her ability to tame even the wildest weather. But this storm felt different. There was an unsettling fury in its roar, a primal rage that sent shivers down her spine. 

The radio crackled to life, spitting static and a faint voice calling out for any aircraft in the vicinity. Ace's gut clenched. It was a distress signal, urgent and desperate. She knew she should stay grounded, wait out the storm. But the voice pleading for help echoed in her ears, a call she couldn't ignore.
