The humid Georgia air clung to Elara "Ellie" Jameson like a second skin as she surveyed the field. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the early hour, the sun already beginning its relentless climb towards midday. The high school football field stretched before her, a patchwork of emerald green and worn brown dirt. The bleachers loomed empty, awaiting the roar of Friday night crowds.

Ellie tugged at the collar of her crisp navy polo shirt, a stark contrast to the grimy jerseys littering the field. Today was hell week: two-a-days, relentless drills, and the ever-present pressure to mold these boys into a winning team. It was a daunting task, especially with a squad that seemed more interested in TikTok dances than tackling. Still, Ellie held onto a flicker of hope. She'd seen glimpses of greatness hidden beneath their apathy: raw talent yearning for direction, a hunger for victory masked by teenage bravado. This year, she vowed to unleash it.
