The acrid scent of burnt coffee hung thick in the air, mingling with the stale aroma of yesterday's takeout containers littering the cluttered desk. Elara Blackwood, her once-glossy black hair now streaked with silver, stared blankly at the flickering screen of her ancient laptop.

Los Angeles, a city shimmering under a relentless sun, stretched out beyond her office window like an endless mirage. But Elara wasn't seeing the palm trees swaying in the breeze or the glittering skyscrapers piercing the azure sky. Her vision was clouded with doubt, fear even. The script lay open before her, a testament to her ambition and now, perhaps, her folly. This wasn't just another Hollywood rom-com or action flick. This was "Echoes of Avalon," a sprawling epic set in Arthurian legend, a project she'd poured her heart and soul into for the past five years.

The problem? Funding had dried up faster than a puddle in the desert sun. Studios balked at the hefty budget, dismissing it as a risky venture. Elara was running out of time, options dwindling like sand through her fingers. 

She needed a miracle.
