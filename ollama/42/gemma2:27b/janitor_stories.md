The fluorescent lights hummed a dissonant symphony as Theodore "Teddy" Finnigan wrestled with a particularly stubborn wad of gum stuck to the underside of a cafeteria table. The aroma of stale pizza and yesterday's french fries hung thick in the air, mingling with the sharp scent of industrial-strength cleaner. Teddy sighed, his breath fogging momentarily in the chilly pre-dawn air. He was used to the solitude of these early morning hours, when the school hallways were silent except for the squeak of his mop and the muffled thump of his cleaning cart against the linoleum floor.

But tonight felt different. A prickling unease crept up Teddy's spine as he worked, a feeling that something was out of place. He couldn't pinpoint it, just a subtle shift in the familiar atmosphere. Perhaps it was the way the shadows danced in the flickering light, or the unnerving stillness that hung heavy in the air. Whatever it was, Teddy couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone.
