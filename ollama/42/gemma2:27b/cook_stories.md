The air hung thick with the scent of rosemary and woodsmoke, a fragrant haze that clung to Eloise Beaumont's apron like a second skin. Dawn was just breaking over the cobbled streets of Aix-en-Provence, casting long shadows from the ancient plane trees lining the Cours Mirabeau. Eloise, her hands dusted with flour, surveyed the bustling chaos of her tiny kitchen. Pots bubbled on the stovetop, their contents releasing aromas that battled for dominance: fragrant saffron bouillabaisse, creamy ratatouille, and the heady sweetness of lavender-infused honey cakes.

Today was market day, the busiest day of the week at "Le Petit Plat," Eloise's beloved bistro tucked away in a quiet corner of the city. Tourists and locals alike flocked to her doorstep, drawn by the promise of authentic Proven√ßal cuisine and Eloise's infectious laughter.
