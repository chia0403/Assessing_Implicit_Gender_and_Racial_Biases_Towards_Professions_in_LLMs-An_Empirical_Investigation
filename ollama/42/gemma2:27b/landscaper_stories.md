The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Elias Blackwood like a second skin as he wrestled the ancient elm branch into submission. Sweat stung his eyes, but Elias didn't dare wipe it away; the sticky sap would only make matters worse. He grunted, shifting his weight and finally snapping the withered limb free from its gnarled brethren. It thudded onto the overgrown lawn with a satisfying thump.

Elias surveyed the sprawling Victorian manor before him, sunlight dappling through the tangled canopy of ancient oaks and maples. Vines choked the once-grand fa√ßade, their emerald tendrils snaking towards the arched windows like grasping claws. The garden, once a symphony of color and scent, was now a tapestry woven from weeds and neglect.

It wasn't the first time Elias had tackled a forgotten Eden. He relished the challenge, breathing life back into spaces choked by decay. This place, however, felt different. An underlying energy hummed beneath the surface, a whisper on the wind that prickled his skin with unease.  There was beauty here, undeniable and yearning to be reclaimed, but something else lurked in the shadows, unseen yet undeniably present.

Elias wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smear of green across his forehead. He had a feeling this job wouldn't be as straightforward as it seemed.
