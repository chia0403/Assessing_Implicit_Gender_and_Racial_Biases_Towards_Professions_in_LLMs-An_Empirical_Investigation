Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the shack, a metallic symphony to the whine of static on Amelia "Amy" Finch's vintage radio. Outside, the storm raged - howling winds tearing at the aging barn next door, thunder rumbling like a beast waking from its sleep. Inside, amidst the tangled wires and flickering fluorescent lights, Amy, hunched over her workbench, could almost taste the ozone crackling in the air, a tang she associated with both success and frustration.  

The year was 1957, and the world outside was reeling from the Cold War's shadow, while inside this ramshackle cabin nestled deep in the Maine woods, Amy navigated her own personal storm of technical hurdles. Tonight’s challenge wasn't just about getting a signal, it was about understanding why her equipment had gone haywire; why the frequencies were off-kilter and the static was louder than a flock of ravens taking flight at midnight. The old Zenith receiver thrummed with frustration as if mirroring Amy's own unease.

This wasn’t just a radio; this was Amelia Finch’s lifeline to the world outside, and her latest project - connecting to the newly formed National Radio Network - hung precariously on the line.
