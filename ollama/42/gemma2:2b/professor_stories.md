The biting wind off the Bay swept Professor Alistair Worthington's tweed jacket right off his shoulders before he could even reach for it. His eyes squinted against the relentless rain, their usual bright blue dulled by years of frustration and countless cups of lukewarm coffee in the cramped office overlooking the University’s ancient library.  He took a deep breath, trying to force the scent of decaying paper and mildew from his nostrils. 

Professor Worthington had devoted his life to deciphering the lost language of the ancients - an impossible task that had left him increasingly disillusioned with both his academic pursuit and the damp confines of his office. His once lively spirit felt as lifeless as the parchment he held, carefully annotated but stubbornly resistant to the light from the single flickering bulb in his dimly lit space. 


Today, however, there was a glimmer of hope.  A package sat on his desk, wrapped in thick brown paper and adorned with a curious symbol etched onto a small piece of wood – an intricately carved bird's head with its wings spread wide like it was about to take flight. The inscription, crudely written on a scrap of parchment that came with the package, simply read: “The answer lies where the words collide.”
 
As he stared at the symbol, Professor Worthington felt a surge of excitement mixed with trepidation. Could this be his break-through? A chance to finally unravel the mysteries hidden in those ancient scrolls? 

He was about to open the package when a sudden tremor shook his office, sending papers scattering across the floor like startled beetles. The rain had intensified, turning into a torrential downpour that sent water pouring through the cracks in the old brick walls.  His heart skipped a beat; this wasn't just another bad storm. This felt different. A feeling of unease settled in his stomach.
