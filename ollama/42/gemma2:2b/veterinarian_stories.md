## Opening Lines:

Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's office, each drop a tiny drumbeat against the worn glass. The fluorescent lights buzzed over her desk, casting an anemic sheen on the stacks of files and the overflowing basket of discarded leashes.  Outside, the storm was churning, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amy as she reviewed the new case file in front of her: "Mr. Bigglesworth's Sudden Deterioration". 

## Setting:

Amy’s office is tucked away in a bustling city block. The walls are lined with shelves overflowing with books, each filled with the weight of years and countless medical cases studied. Her desk, a testament to years of dedicated service, holds a worn leather bound stethoscope, a box of old animal toys for emergency visits, and an ever-present stack of files - all meticulously organized, just like her patient’s medical records. 

## Main Character: Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne

A young woman with warm brown eyes that hold the weight of countless sleepless nights spent caring for other people's beloved creatures, Amy Hawthorne is a veterinary surgeon on the cusp of something more. The years have etched lines on her face, each one a story of animal lives she has touched – and now, it seems, an even bigger tale awaits her.
