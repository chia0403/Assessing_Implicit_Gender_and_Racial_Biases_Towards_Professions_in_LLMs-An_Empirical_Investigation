The smoky haze hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elara's worn apron like a lover's embrace. The dim light of the "Rusty Crow" cast elongated shadows on her weathered face as she wiped down the countertop with practiced ease.  It was 2:00 AM on a Wednesday, a night when even the ghosts seemed reluctant to leave. Elara knew these late-night hours like an old friend – the clattering of glasses, the hushed conversations punctuated by bursts of laughter and tears, the smell of spilled whisky and burnt coffee - all held a familiarity that was both comforting and unsettling. 

Elara’s fingers traced the etched inscription on her battered wooden spoon, “Always Remember,” a reminder of a time she wished to forget. Her late grandfather had gifted it before his passing, leaving behind a legacy of bittersweet memories and empty promises.  She worked at The Rusty Crow, a dive bar with more stories than years - and more secrets than she cared to admit.
