## The Last Light

The air hung heavy with humidity and the scent of salt spray as Elara "Elle" Reyes crouched beneath a crumbling stone archway on the outskirts of San Juan's old city. Moonlight bathed the cobblestones in an ethereal glow, casting long, dancing shadows. Elle, her Leica strapped tightly against her chest, had been drawn here by a whisper she couldn't quite place, a story told over stale coffee and whispered between locals about a hidden gem.  A dilapidated lighthouse on the rocky cliff top, rumored to have witnessed forgotten secrets in its silent vigil. 

Elle was no stranger to seeking beauty in the forgotten corners of life.  Her photographs, often stark black and white portraits of people living lives unseen, held a quiet power that spoke of resilience, hope, and human connection. Yet tonight, she wasn't just seeking an image; she felt something deeper stirring within her. This place felt raw, primal, pulsing with the same energy that coursed through her own soul.  As she adjusted the camera's flash for a single, decisive moment, she heard it â€“ the low groan of shifting stone and the distant howl of the wind. The lighthouse loomed closer, its silhouette against the inky sky as if it were trying to pierce the veil between worlds.
