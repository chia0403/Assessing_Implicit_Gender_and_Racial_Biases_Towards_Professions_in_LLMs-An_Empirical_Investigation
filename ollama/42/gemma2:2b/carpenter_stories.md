The rasping whine of the ancient saw filled the air as Elias Blackwood carefully shaved away at the worn oak boards. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the dust motes dancing in its golden rays. His workshop, nestled in the quiet corner of his family’s old mill, was a symphony of wood and sawdust; a testament to years of labor and passion. It wasn't much to look at – rough hewn beams, patched-up floors, and shelves groaning under the weight of half-finished projects – but for Elias, it was everything. 

He was a man of quiet hands, strong and calloused from a lifetime spent coaxing wood into life. He’d learned the trade from his grandfather, passed on tales of forgotten woods and enchanted joints, instilled in him a love for the raw power of nature's offering. But lately, something felt different. A gnawing unease settled over Elias as he stared at the weathered boards before him, the once familiar scent now tinged with an underlying sense of wrongness. 

The mill had been quiet since his father’s passing last month. The weight of his loss hung heavy in the air like a shroud, and Elias felt adrift on a sea of grief and uncertainty. He was meant to rebuild their family legacy – restore the mill to its former glory. But now, with each meticulously shaped board, the reality of a future without his father’s guiding hand loomed large.
