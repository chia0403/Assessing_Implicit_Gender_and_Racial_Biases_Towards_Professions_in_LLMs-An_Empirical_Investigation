Rain hammered against the windowpanes of the modest office building on Elm Street, each drop a tiny drum beat against the dreary facade. Inside, Eleanor Thornton, or Ellie as she was known to her clientele (and perhaps begrudgingly) by some, hunched over her desk, a mountain of tax forms towering before her like an unruly forest. 

Ellie wasn't built for this life. Not exactly. With her long auburn braid cascading down her back and the ever-present sheen of flour dust on her worn apron, she seemed more suited to baking than battling the complexities of Uncle Samâ€™s ever-evolving tax code. Yet here she was, years into her career as a tax preparer, facing another year of trying to decipher complex schedules and loopholes for people who didn't even understand basic income brackets. The irony wasn't lost on Ellie.  Even with the relentless rain outside mirroring the storm brewing in her soul, Ellie had no choice but to continue. It was a calling, she reasoned, as much a duty as it was an escape from the monotonous life of a small-town baker.
