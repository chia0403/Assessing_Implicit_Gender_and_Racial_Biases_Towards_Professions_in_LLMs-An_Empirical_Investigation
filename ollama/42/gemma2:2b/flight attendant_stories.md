## Opening:

**Setting:**  A cramped, humid cabin on an American Airlines Boeing 777 bound for London. The air was thick with recycled air and the scent of stale coffee. A gentle hum vibrated through the aircraft as it ascended into the darkening sky, leaving behind the familiar cityscape of Chicago. 

**Character:** Amelia "Amy" Thorne. At just 25 years old, Amy felt like a seasoned veteran of the skies.  Sixteen years in the airline industry had given her an uncanny knack for reading people and calming even the most anxious fliers. Her heart thrummed with the familiar rhythm of pre-departure jitters - that mixture of excitement and weariness she couldn't help but feel when leaving family and friends behind, yet again.

**Story Opening:**

"Please take your seats and secure your safety belts," Amy announced with a calm smile, her voice echoing through the cabin. "We’re about to start our climb for London."  But as the announcement echoed around her, Amy couldn't shake off a sense of unease. Something about this flight felt…different. 

The pre-takeoff routine was usually predictable; a symphony of announcements and safety checks, punctuated by the comforting drone of engines and the hushed anticipation of passengers settling in.  But tonight, there was an undercurrent of tension. The murmurings and glances exchanged amongst passengers were sharper, more urgent than usual. 

Amy’s eyes darted around the cabin, taking in the faces etched with a mixture of apprehension and curiosity. She felt it too; something about this flight hummed different, like a hidden current beneath the surface. Something wasn't right.
