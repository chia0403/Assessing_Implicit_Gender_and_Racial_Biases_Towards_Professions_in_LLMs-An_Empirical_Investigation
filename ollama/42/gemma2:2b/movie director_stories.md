## Setting the Stage: 

**City Lights:**  A neon-drenched rain dances on the slick asphalt of Los Angeles, reflecting off the chrome curves of vintage cars parked along Sunset Boulevard. The year is 1978 and Hollywood is a churning beast, hungry for the next big story. This night, the air hums with the buzz of anticipation as director **Alan Thorne**, known for his gritty dramas, prepares for another shoot.  

Alan, gaunt and wearing a tired smile, leans against the door frame of his modest bungalow overlooking a crumbling Hollywood sign. The scent of stale coffee lingers in the air alongside the faint aroma of burnt popcorn from the late-night snack run he made with his assistant earlier. He runs a hand through his thinning hair, frustration gnawing at him.  His latest film, "The Underdog," about a struggling musician in the heart of the LA music scene, was supposed to be his breakout role. Instead, it's stalled, plagued by budget cuts and a cast whose egos outweighed their talent. 

**Alan Thorne:** "This city eats dreams. And then spits them back out." he mutters under his breath, staring at the flickering shadows dancing on the worn floorboards. A single cigarette glows in the darkness, casting an orange glow over his face as he rubs his tired eyes.


His gaze falls upon a crumpled script lying abandoned on a dusty table, its pages marked with frantic scribbles and coffee stains. 
"What am I doing?"  he whispers, his voice heavy with doubt and exhaustion. "This is it."

**What story awaits?**
