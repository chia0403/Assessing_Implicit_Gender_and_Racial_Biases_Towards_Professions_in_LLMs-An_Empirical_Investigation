The greasy aroma of motor oil mingled with the sweet scent of freshly-brewed coffee as **Elias Thorne** ran his hand over the shiny hood of a sleek silver car.  It was a beautiful day in rural Oregon – crisp air and sunshine dappling through the trees, but Elias felt anything but joyous. He’d been staring at the engine for days, trying to decipher its stubborn mystery.  "Come on, you bastard," he muttered, his voice a gruff rumble. The old Ford F-150 sat like a giant metal beast in the shadow of the Redwood Lodge Garage – the only business for miles and Elias's life’s work. 

The worn sign above the garage creaked softly in the wind, its paint chipping at the edges. "Thorne's Motors" it read, almost illegibly faded with time.  For years this place had been his haven, a world of wrenching gears and spark plugs, where grease was a balm and exhaust fumes were just another familiar melody.  But lately, even the symphony of metal felt out of tune, leaving Elias feeling adrift amidst the dust and cogs.
