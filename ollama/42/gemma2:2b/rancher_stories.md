The crisp mountain air stung Elara's cheeks as she checked her latest herd pen. Dawn painted the sky in streaks of fiery orange and bruised purple over the vast plains of Montana, their hues mirroring the turmoil churning within Elara’s own heart.  She was named for the majestic wind-swept valleys that cradled her family's ranch, a legacy built on grit and resilience against the unforgiving landscape. But this year, the valley felt more like a tomb than a sanctuary. Drought had crippled their herd, leaving them at the mercy of a sky choked by dust.

The mare’s hooves, usually light and sure-footed, were heavy with fatigue from weeks of traversing parched land. Elara closed her eyes, inhaling the scent of hay and dust that clung to every corner of their weathered ranch house. This year felt like a storm brewing on the horizon, one that threatened to swallow everything she held dear.
