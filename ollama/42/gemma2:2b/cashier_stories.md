The fluorescent hum of the convenience store lights buzzed in Aila's ears as she rang up groceries. It was a Wednesday night, just before closing time, which meant the usual crowd: tired commuters, weary shift-workers, and families on the run after 7 pm. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale popcorn and artificial sweetener.  The cashier counter, where Aila normally felt invisible, stood like a lonely sentinel. It was her domain, but tonight, even the usual order of things seemed off.

Aila's eyes scanned the items in the basket: a box of cereal that looked suspiciously out of place next to a dozen cans of tuna, a half-deflated basketball nestled against a pack of ramen noodles - each one telling a tiny story of the day’s journey from grocery store to customer's hands.  Her name was Aila Perez, and as she stared at the tired faces behind her, a sense of unease settled on her like a winter coat. 

Tonight felt different, a feeling amplified by a strange silence that had replaced the usual murmur of conversations. The air crackled with an almost tangible anticipation – something beyond the usual hum of customers. Aila felt it too; a ripple of energy that tugged at the edges of her being, pulling her from behind the counter and into the unknown.
