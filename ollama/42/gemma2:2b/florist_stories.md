The air hung heavy with the sweet scent of lilies and honeysuckle, a stark contrast to the icy chill gripping Amelia Hawthorne's fingertips. Her shop, 'A Bloom for Every Season,' nestled amidst the bustling street market in old London, was usually alive with joyous chatter and the gentle clinking of flower pots against each other. But today, a somber quiet had settled over the air, mirroring the heavy weight in Amelia's chest.

She looked out from behind the glass counter at the familiar rows of vibrant tulips and sun-kissed roses, their beauty almost a betrayal against the bleakness that clung to them. The weight wasn't just in the air; it was in her heart – heavy with the news of her grandmother’s passing, a woman whose love for florals ran deeper than any ink on a botanical chart.
