The scent of burnt sugar lingered in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to Amelia like her own shadow. It was Thursday, which meant it was “Scone Day” at Sunnyside Preschool - an event Amelia both dreaded and relished. As Ms. Willow's assistant, she had to oversee the chaotic assembly line of tiny hands wielding cookie cutters, faces smeared with frosting, a whirlwind of sugar-fueled dreams. The setting sun cast long shadows across the classroom windows, transforming the usually brightly lit room into a hazy canvas of orange and purple. 

Amelia adjusted her glasses and surveyed the scene. Her heart thumped against her ribs – a familiar rhythm that came with navigating the unpredictable terrain of preschoolers. A particularly loud outburst from the corner, where Timmy was struggling to separate his cookie-cut animal creation from its fellow creatures, made her smile widen. “It’s okay, Timmy!” she chirped, grabbing him gently before he could unleash another roar.  

“Don’t worry,” she said, kneeling down and offering a reassuring pat on his head. "We'll get it sorted out. Just like we always do."
