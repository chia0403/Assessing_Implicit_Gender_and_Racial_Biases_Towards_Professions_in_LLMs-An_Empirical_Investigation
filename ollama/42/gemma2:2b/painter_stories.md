## The Salt & Sky Blues

**Setting:**  A weathered, sun-bleached lighthouse perched on a craggy cliff overlooking a stormy sea. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the fury of the ocean below. 

**Character:** Elara Blackwood, a woman who could paint the world's secrets into life with just a brush and a canvas, yet whose own soul remained shrouded in a fog of grief.  She had lost her husband, Alistair, a celebrated marine biologist, to a freak storm at sea just two years ago.  

**Opening:** Elara knelt by her easel, a small, battered box beside it. Inside lay Alistair's journal - bound in worn leather and filled with his meticulous scribbles on the ocean’s currents, the language of its creatures, and the intricate beauty she believed he'd found in the vast emptiness of the sea.  She traced her fingers over the faded ink, a familiar ache blooming in her chest. Elara had always said "the salt and sky blues" - his signature phrase - represented both their love for the ocean and the sadness that clung to them like fog itself. He was gone, lost in the very place he'd devoted his life to exploring, and the words seemed to echo with a silent plea: *Where is your art, Elara?*  He’d left her this journal, filled with notes on a new discovery – an underwater cave rumored to hold a breathtaking ecosystem untouched by human hand. His dream was to map it out, capture its secrets in scientific form, and then… maybe, find a way to bring some beauty back into her life too. 


Elara took a deep breath, the damp air heavy with salt.  The storm raged on, mirroring the turmoil within her. She looked up at the flickering lighthouse lantern that cast an unsteady glow through the rain-streaked glass, feeling both suffocated and inspired by its soft light.  "Alistair," she whispered, "Show me your cave."
