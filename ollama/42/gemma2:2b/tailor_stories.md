The midday sun beat down on the cobblestones, turning the air thick and heavy in Prague's Old Town.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of light filtering through the stained-glass windows of the tiny workshop nestled into the heart of the maze-like alleyway.   Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" St. Clair hummed to himself as he meticulously stitched a silk doublet for a young lord. He was known throughout the city for his meticulousness, his fine hand capable of crafting both elegant gowns and sturdy breeches with equal ease.  His shop, “The Stitcher’s Nook,” had become an oasis in the bustling city, offering not just clothes but a sense of calm amidst the frenetic energy. 

Barty sighed as he adjusted the final button on the doublet. A knock echoed from within the workshop’s warped wooden door. The sound was familiar – it was always accompanied by the same rhythmic tap-tap-tap, the soft click of small steps across the worn flagstones leading into his workshop.  He knew who it would be.
