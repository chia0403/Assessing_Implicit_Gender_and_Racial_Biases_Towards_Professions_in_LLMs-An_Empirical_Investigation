## The City's Shadow

The concrete jungle pressed in on Amelia Thorne like a physical force, its towering edifices casting an oppressive shadow across her tiny apartment balcony. Rain hammered down, mirroring the incessant drumming in her skull as she stared out at the swirling mass of humanity below.  Each building seemed to rise like a crooked finger pointing accusatory at her, each window reflecting back the same disquiet within her soul. 

Amelia Thorne was known for two things: her stunning architectural designs and her crippling fear of the city’s underbelly. Her work was lauded – a beacon of modernism against the tide of urban decay - yet she remained anchored to the surface world like a ship caught in a storm, constantly wary of the darkness that lurked just beneath the glittering facade.

This night, however, felt different. The familiar dissonance of her surroundings had been warped into something sharper, more unsettling. A single gust of wind rattled the windowpane, carrying with it an almost imperceptible whisper – a voice she thought she'd only ever heard in her dreams.
