The whirring of the espresso machine was like white noise in a constant storm. It was 2:30 AM, and rain hammered against the grimy windows of "The Last Call," a diner clinging to life on Main Street. Its neon sign, once a beacon of hope for tired travelers and weary souls, now pulsed weakly with faded green light, casting the space in an ethereal blue glow.  

The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of stale coffee and the ghost of burnt sugar. It was just Amelia "Amy" Carter's kind of place. After years on her feet serving the late-shift crowd at this beat-up diner, she knew every creak of its floorboards, every flickering neon, and every faded photograph tacked to the wall.

Tonight's storm was particularly vicious; wind howled like a wounded animal through the skeletal branches overhead while thunder clapped like a giant’s clenched fists against the tin roof. The rain-soaked streets below were choked with waterlogged refuse, and Amelia could barely see past the deluge of rainwater cascading down her diner window.  

Despite the storm's fury and the late hour, a curious mix of regulars was already settling into their usual booths: an elderly couple huddled in the corner, whispering about something best left unspoken; a young man with a faded tattoo on his arm, hunched over a mug of lukewarm coffee; and a woman in a fur coat, her face hidden in the shadows. 

Amy knew it was going to be a long night... and that’s when she heard it: a muffled thud followed by an echo that seemed to reverberate through the diner like a death knell. The clattering of dishes, usually a gentle symphony of clinking plates and cutlery, suddenly stopped.  
 
Amy looked up. A shiver ran down her spine. 

This night was about to get interesting.
