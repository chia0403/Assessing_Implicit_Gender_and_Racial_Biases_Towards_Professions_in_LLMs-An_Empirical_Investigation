## The Scents of Sorrow

**Setting:** A grimy, two-story shop in a forgotten corner of Belfast’s industrial district. 

**Characters:** Bartholomew "Bart" MacAllister, owner and sole employee of MacAllister's Meats, a family-run butcher shop that had been passed down through generations. 

**Opening:** The morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets like phantoms, its dampness seeping into the worn wooden beams of Bart's shop.  A steady drizzle hammered against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the rhythm of his heartbeat – a slow, melancholic tap-tap-tap. Around him, the scent of charring meat mingled with the sharp tang of brine and the dusty aroma of old leather bags. 

Bart's gaze was fixed on the butcher block in front of him, its surface scarred by years of use and countless carcasses. Each cut, each pound, held a story – stories of laughter, sorrow, celebration and mourning, all woven into the tapestry of his life.  He felt it again today, as he carefully selected a plump leg of lamb for Mrs. O'Neill, whose son was heading to university and who longed to recreate her mother's famous roast dinner. A familiar ache settled in his chest, another story lost with the memories of the old woman who had first taught him how to handle a cleaver with such finesse that it almost whispered instead of wielded. 

It had been two years since he’d last seen a proper funeral procession; two years since his father's passing had left a gaping hole in his life and shattered the comforting rhythm of their shared work.  Bart was still picking up the pieces, trying to carve a new normality from the fragments of his grief. The shop was his solace, a place where he could drown himself in the familiar tang of blood, fat, and brine – the scent of his legacy. 

Tonight, however, even that scent felt suffocating.  The silence of the afternoon had begun to stretch into an unnerving quietude. The only sound was the relentless patter of rain outside, a drumbeat against which Bart's worries echoed. A knock on the door startled him. He wiped his hands and peered through the gloom, noticing for the first time the slight frost clinging to the windowpanes.  A chill ran down his spine.
