## The Setting

The grand Victorian hotel, the Astorian Manor, stood sentinel against the sprawling Chicago skyline like a weathered, yet majestic king. Its ornate facade was a symphony of carved mahogany doors, stained glass that cast kaleidoscopic patterns on the marble floors, and iron balconies overlooking a bustling city street alive with hurried feet and honking taxis.  The air thrummed with an unseen energy, a blend of hope and ambition that felt as palpable as the scent of freshly baked bread wafting from the bakery below.

## The Character

**Alaric Thorne**, his age weathered beyond any years he'd truly lived, stood amongst these familiar surroundings. His hands were calloused but gentle, their routine caretaking of the Astorian Manor a comfort to him.  He'd been its concierge for over thirty years, a silent guardian of its legacy and its secrets. He knew every creak in the floorboards, every draft blowing in from the forgotten alleyways behind the building. He understood the whispers of guests, their desires and anxieties, like the language of poetry whispered between two souls. 

The setting sun cast long shadows over the Astorian Manor, illuminating Alaricâ€™s weary eyes as he surveyed the scene.  A hush had fallen over the grand halls, leaving only the faint click of a grandfather clock echoing in the vast emptiness. It was almost time for his nightly rounds, and with every step he took across polished marble floors, the weight of history seemed to settle upon him like an old cloak.
