A world spun from quiet routine: weeding rosebeds, mending fences, and tending the sprawling gardens that hummed with life – all while the whispers of history echoed around him.

As he walked back towards the manor house, Teddy noticed something strange: a flicker of light dancing between the gnarled branches of a particularly ancient willow tree, its leaves shimmering in defiance of the gray gloom.
