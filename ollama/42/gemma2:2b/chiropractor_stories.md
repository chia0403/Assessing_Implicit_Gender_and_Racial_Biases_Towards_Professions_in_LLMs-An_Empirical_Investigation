The sun was struggling to pierce through the thick smog that clung to New Orleans like a damp shroud.  Even at midday, the humidity hung heavy in the air, sticky against Amelia Dubois's skin as she surveyed her patients' waiting room from behind the oak desk. She adjusted the silver-rimmed glasses perched precariously on her nose, smoothing down the wrinkles of a faded velvet scarf draped over the worn armrest.  

Amelia, "Dr. Amy" to her regulars, was more than just a chiropractor; she was a storyteller with callused hands and an uncanny ability to mend both physical ailments and shattered spirits.  Her clinic, tucked away on the edge of the Treme neighborhood, felt like a refuge amidst the city's ceaseless churn. 

Today, a young woman named Marie sat nervously tapping her foot. Her shoulder was stiff, her posture slouched in despair. Amelia could practically hear the knot of worry tightening around Marie's throat as she waited for her turn, its tendrils reaching out to grasp at any semblance of hope.  She knew this was more than just a sprain. It was another thread in the tapestry of life, another knot to untangle.
