Rain pattered against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Sprocket," a thrift store nestled in the shadow of an imposing skyscraper that scraped the bruised sky. Inside, Amelia Bellweather's lips curled into a tight smile as she expertly weaved through a maze of chipped china and dusty records. She was no stranger to this chaotic symphony of forgotten memories. 

After years in the unforgiving sales floor of a big-box store, Amelia had finally landed her dream job â€“ selling pre-loved treasures at The Rusty Sprocket.  Today, she faced an unfamiliar challenge: a new shipment of vintage clothing arrived with a collection of brightly colored garments and an uncomfortably sweet aroma of mothballs. 

**Character:** Amelia Bellweather
