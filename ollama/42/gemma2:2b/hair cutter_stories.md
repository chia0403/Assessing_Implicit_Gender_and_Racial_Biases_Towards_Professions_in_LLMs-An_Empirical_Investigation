The whirring of clippers was Silas's lullaby.  His fingers danced across the comb with practiced ease, the rhythmic snipping of his shears a melody in the symphony of sounds that filled "Silas' Snips."  For twenty years, this cramped corner barbershop on Elm Street had been his domain, and he, Silas Blackwood, was its undisputed king. 

The scent of stale hairspray and beeswax hung thick in the air, a familiar and comforting aroma. Outside, the late summer afternoon buzzed with the quiet energy of a city waking from slumber.  Silas watched a stray fly struggle against the wind, a flicker of yellow and black against the dull brick facade of his shop window.  He wasn't blind to the world outside, but he was comfortable in this microcosm, where the familiar felt like a balm against the relentless pulse of the city.
