The fluorescent hum was a constant drone in Felix's ears, punctuated only by the clink of his mop against the tile floors.  A cold draft snaked through the cavernous atrium of the Grand Central Library, swirling dust motes into miniature galaxies across the polished marble floor. He hated this place - its oppressive silence and the weight of history pressing down on him like a library's worth of unread tomes. 

Felix "The Flash" Farrow, as he was known amongst his fellow janitors, had spent years tending to the Grand Central Library, his life a carefully choreographed routine punctuated by an endless stream of dust bunnies, overflowing trash cans, and the occasional (and often hilarious) encounter with an overzealous poet reading their sonnet in the courtyard. His heart, however, yearned for something more than sweeping floors and cleaning toilets.
