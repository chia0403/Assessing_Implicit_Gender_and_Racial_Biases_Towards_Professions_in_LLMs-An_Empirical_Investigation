## The Flicker

**Setting:** A ramshackle apartment building in Chicago's West Loop district, built over 100 years ago but still holding onto its historic charm (and some serious structural flaws). 

**Main Character:**  Elias "Eli" Thorne - a young and fiercely independent electrician with hands as rough as the old wire he works with.  Eli inherited his grandfather’s worn tool bag and an unwavering belief in using his talents to fix things, even if those “things” often turn out to be more complicated than expected. 

**Opening:**

A symphony of clicks and whirs filled the air within Eli's cramped apartment. The smell of fresh varnish, a testament to his latest repair job on a crumbling storefront sign, hung heavy in the thin air.  He was knee-deep in wiring the back-lit neon lettering for a vintage diner opening its doors down the street, when it happened - a flicker in the light fixture he’d been working with. 

"Damn," Eli muttered, his frustration bubbling over like the kettle on the stove next to him, “Just as I was getting used to this old girl's rhythm."  He adjusted a loose wire, muttering to himself about faulty wiring and a lifetime of stubborn electrical issues. The flicker was nothing more than a fleeting impression before returning to its usual rhythm. But this time, Eli felt something else – an uncanny sense of presence in the room. 

As he replaced the last wire, a shadow shifted at the window.  Eli turned slowly, eyes narrowed, heart quickening. Was it his imagination? Or was there something more? His fingers instinctively gripped the wrench, feeling its cold metal against his palm.
