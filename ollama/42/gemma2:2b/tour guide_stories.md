The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of salt as Elara "Ellie" Hawthorne, her hair plastered to her forehead by sweat, steered their group through the bustling heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. Her Louis Vuitton-bag adorned waist gave her a certain panache amongst the throngs of tourists, but Ellie couldn't shake off the feeling that every glance was tinged with something…uncanny.  

She gestured to a wrought iron balcony above, its faded paint showing signs of an old age that felt too deliberate to be natural. "Remember folks," she said, her voice tight, "that's where they say Marie Laveau made her bargains." 

Ellie knew it was just folklore. But lately, even the whispers around these cobbled streets had taken on a different chill. The stories, once dismissed as mere tourist fiction, now seemed…too personal.  


**Setting:** New Orleans' French Quarter. A lively melting pot of history, music, and magic. The energy is thick, tinged with both charm and unease.

**Main Character:** Ellie Hawthorne - A professional tour guide with a hidden past she guards closely.
