The midday sun beat down on the cracked stone of the Citadel's outer walls, its glare amplified by the vast expanse of sand that stretched towards the horizon. A thin, oppressive haze hung in the air, punctuated by the cries of startled birds as they flitted through the skeletal branches of ancient acacia trees that clung to the crumbling edges of the city. 

This was the domain of Corvus Thorne, a man as stoic and weathered as the sandstone he patrolled. His thick, dark hair was pulled back from his brow, his eyes reflecting the relentless glare of the sun like two obsidian chips. For years, Corvus had served in the Citadel's guard, his duty a silent oath sworn on a battlefield where victory seemed more myth than reality. He had grown accustomed to the weight of responsibility that rested upon his broad shoulders, the burden of keeping order in a city teetering on the precipice between hope and decay.

He walked the length of the wall, his armor clinking against his thigh as he scanned for any sign of unrest. The Citadel's inhabitants lived in fear of the endless sandstorms, the treacherous winds that could sweep them away with equal swiftness to a ship's mast at sea. And tonight, Corvus knew, they would have their usual nightmare - another night where the sky coughed up a tempest of dust and debris, obscuring the moon and leaving them in an embrace of silent terror.
