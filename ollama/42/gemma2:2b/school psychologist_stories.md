## Setting: Whispering Woods Elementary

**Character:**  Dr. Amelia Finch - a woman in her early forties with tired eyes hidden behind thick-rimmed glasses and hair pulled back tightly away from a face etched with constant concern. Years spent navigating the tangled emotional landscapes of children had left their mark. 

Amelia stepped through the double doors, the musty aroma of old textbooks and crayons clinging to the air. Whispering Woods Elementary was a chaotic symphony of shrieks and giggles, punctuated by the occasional exasperated roar from a parent. A familiar wave of dread washed over her as she surveyed the waiting area - a sea of mismatched chairs, peeling paint, and posters proclaiming "Love is Kind" with a faded image of a unicorn that looked more like a disgruntled goat.  

The school psychologist wasn't exactly a 'welcome committee' in this jungle. But Amelia had come to understand that true change begins in the most unlikely of places: not at the top of the educational hierarchy, but with understanding and compassion for the raw emotions hidden beneath the facade of normalcy. Today, she was hoping her empathy would be enough to help little Daniel navigate a storm of feelings only he could see.

* **Introduce another character.** Perhaps a student whose behavior is causing concern, or a teacher who seems lost amidst the chaos of the classroom. 
* **Shift to the outside world.** Is there something happening in the wider community that impacts Daniel's life and Amelia's work?
