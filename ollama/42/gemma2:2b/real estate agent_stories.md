Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane of Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne's office, each drop echoing like tiny bells in the otherwise silent room. The air inside hung thick with the lingering scent of stale coffee and yesterday’s anxiety. Ellie adjusted her glasses, the glare from the single overhead light illuminating the stacks of unopened mail on her desk.

The grand Victorian mansion at the edge of town, with its crumbling facade and overgrown garden, sat vacant –  a silent testament to its former owner's sudden departure. Now, it was Ellie's responsibility to sell this behemoth to whoever dared take it on. The city buzzed about the estate's sale, whispering tales of hidden treasures and potential fortune, but no one had seemed willing to step into the shadows left behind.
