The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and freshly cut grass in the sun-drenched physical therapy gym.  Name: Amara Chen. Her crisp white scrubs felt oddly out of place amidst the boisterous chaos of playground swings, a wobbly balance beam, and the rhythmic thumping of an oversized rubber ball against the concrete floor. Amara surveyed her patients with a practiced eye. There was young Timmy, whose giggles hid a fear of heights he could barely articulate; shy little Elena, who found solace only in the embrace of her dog, Luna; and Michael, who stared out the window with a frown, seemingly lost in his own world. 

Today's session focused on building strength and coordination for the upcoming school field day, but Amara felt a nagging disquiet in the back of her mind. A feeling she hadn't encountered since...since the tragedy that had unfolded just weeks ago at the community center where she worked.  She had always been drawn to children, their boundless energy igniting something deep within her. Now, however, even the most innocent laughter felt tainted by the lingering darkness.
