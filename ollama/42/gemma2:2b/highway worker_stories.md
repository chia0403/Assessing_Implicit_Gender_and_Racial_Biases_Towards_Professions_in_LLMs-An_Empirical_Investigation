The Nevada sun beat down on Elias 'Ace' Carter’s weathered face, turning his usually-slicked back hair into a greasy halo. His calloused hands gripped the rusted steering wheel of his battered pickup truck as he navigated the desolate stretch of Route 305, the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching out in every direction like a forgotten promise.  It was another sweltering day at work for Ace – not exactly a glamorous life, but one that kept the lights on and his family fed back home in Utah. The air hung thick with dust and the scent of burnt oil, punctuated by the rhythmic hum of Ace’s old engine.  He adjusted his worn fedora, feeling the sweat prickling under the brim. A sudden rustle in the dry sage brush caught his eye.
