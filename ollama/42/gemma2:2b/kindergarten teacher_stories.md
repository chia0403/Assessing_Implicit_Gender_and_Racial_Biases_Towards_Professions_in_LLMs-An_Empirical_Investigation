Rain lashed against the windows of Maplewood Kindergarten, blurring the streetlights into a hazy mess. Inside, Ms. Elsie Beatrice Evergreen meticulously crafted paper snowflakes for the upcoming winter fair, humming a cheery tune as her usual classroom chaos unfolded outside. Her students, a vibrant blur of mismatched socks and over-sized backpacks, were engaged in their own version of "Wild Animals," where giggles echoed through the room as they pretended to be ferocious tigers and shy bunnies, each one more flamboyant than the last. 

Elsie's heart swelled with the joy she felt observing them, even amidst the occasional spilled juice box or forgotten lunchbox. But today was different. Today, Ms. Evergreen had a visitor, a man in a crisp suit who smelled of old books and forgotten libraries.  He carried a small briefcase adorned with an intricate wood carving â€“ a single, sharp raven on the lid. Elsie's eyes widened at his appearance; she had received no warning about this unexpected visit.
