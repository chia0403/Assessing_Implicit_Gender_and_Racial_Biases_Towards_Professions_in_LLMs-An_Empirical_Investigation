## The Whispering Oven

**Setting:** A quaint seaside village nestled between rolling hills and the crashing waves of the North Sea. Quaint shops line cobblestone streets where fishermen unload their catches onto the docks, the salty tang of fish and brine filling the air. 

The year is 1895. 

**Main Character:**  Elara Blackwood, known throughout the village as "Little E" for her diminutive stature and fiery spirit. She's a headstrong cook at the "Saltwind Tavern," where she reigns over the kitchen with an iron fist and flour-dusted apron. 

**Story Opening:** 
The air hung thick with the scent of cod, onions, and woodsmoke as Elara watched the seagulls circle above the tavern's roof, their cries echoing across the harbor. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of burnt orange and fiery red, reflecting off the storm-tossed waves churning just beyond the docks. Tonight was a special night.  Tonight, the annual Oyster Festival was upon them, with all its boisterous revelry and the promise of overflowing plates of fresh seafood. But a knot of unease gnawed at Elaraâ€™s stomach. A stranger had arrived in town only yesterday, a man named Silas, whose eyes held a glint of silver beneath the shadows of his hat brim, who spoke with a voice as smooth and sly as the salt brine itself. 

He'd walked into her kitchen unannounced, his presence an unwelcome intrusion amidst the symphony of clanging pots and the comforting hum of baking yeast. He had sought her out, requesting "just a taste" of Elara's famous sourdough bread. But what he truly desired was something more...something she couldn't quite grasp or refuse.

As Elara moved to pull out the dough from the oven's warmth, leaving a trail of flour dust in her wake,  she could feel his eyes on her, watching her with an unnerving intensity.
