The late August air hung heavy in the lobby, thick with the scent of pipe tobacco and forgotten dreams. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight streaming through the grimy windows of the Grand Meridian Hotel, illuminating the worn velvet upholstery on the plush chairs and the tarnished brass accents that once whispered stories of a bygone era.  Here, amidst the echoing silence of empty rooms and the faint hum of the elevator's mechanical groan, resided Theodore "Theo" Blackwood, bellhop extraordinaire. 

At just twenty-five years old, Theo navigated the grand hotel with practiced ease. His worn uniform was his shield against a world of discerning guests and their even more discerning expectations.  A quick flick of his wrist could summon an overflowing trolley of luggage, each box bearing its own weight of secrets â€“ from forgotten love letters to priceless family heirlooms.  He knew the whispers of the building's underbelly like a well-worn song: the secret love affairs in the penthouse suite, the whispered anxieties of the executive floor, and the unspoken stories hidden behind the worn wallpaper. 

Theo had found his place at the Grand Meridian - not because of its opulence or its history, but because it was a place where dreams, like luggage tags, could be lost and found again. His own dreams were still shrouded in dust, however. He just hadn't found the courage to unpack them yet.
