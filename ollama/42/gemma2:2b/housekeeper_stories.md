## The Scent of Old Roses

**Setting:**  The rambling manor house, known as Blackwood Manor, stood on a hill overlooking the sleepy village of Oakhaven. A tangle of ivy crept across its ornate brick facade, and the sun, sinking behind the trees, cast long shadows that danced in the dying light.

**Character:** Amelia "Amy" Croft was the housekeeper of Blackwood Manor. With hands calloused from years of scrubbing floors and polishing silver, she moved with a quiet grace through the silent rooms. The smell of lavender and dust clung to her like an old friend, as comforting and familiar as her worn apron.  Years had etched lines on Amy's face, but her eyes sparkled with a mischievous glint that betrayed the secrets she held close within.

**Story Opening:** "It's not just the scent of roses, Mrs. Blackwood," Amy said to the portrait in the drawing-room, its faded smile a beacon of time and forgotten memories.  "It's the way they smell, just like the woman herself." Her voice was soft as she spoke, her eyes fixed on the rosebud clutched tightly in her hand. "She would've loved this one, wouldnâ€™t you say?"

As if answering her unspoken question, a faint breeze stirred through the drawing-room, carrying with it a delicate fragrance of old roses and whispers of forgotten dreams.  A shiver ran down Amy's spine. Blackwood Manor held more than just dust and cobwebs; it held secrets that whispered in the shadows and echoed in the silence.  It was a place where time had taken hold, leaving its mark on everything from the worn velvet curtains to the melancholy portraits that watched with knowing eyes. And tonight, as Amy stood amongst the ghosts of Blackwood Manor, she felt an unsettling premonition.
