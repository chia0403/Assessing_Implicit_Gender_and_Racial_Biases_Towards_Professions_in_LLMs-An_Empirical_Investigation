The late summer air hung heavy with humidity as Elias "Eli" Crane surveyed the mess before him.  Dust motes danced in the harsh beams of sunlight that slanted through the worn plywood planks covering the attic's gaping window. It was his world, this cramped, dusty space, and he knew it better than his own reflection. A lifetime spent under the relentless assault of sky and weather had left its mark on him – wrinkles etched into his face like a map of a life lived outdoors – but he wouldn't trade it for anything. 

Eli was a roofer, through and through.  He'd built his career on hard work, steady hands, and an unshakable faith in the resilience of good, sturdy materials. Today's job, however, was different. A storm had rolled through the week before, ripping off shingles from the old Victorian house just down the street. The owner, Mrs. Peabody, a woman whose age seemed to have melted into one continuous year, had pleaded for Eli to fix it up. 

The problem wasn't just replacing the damaged wood; it was getting inside this ramshackle structure. The warped floorboards creaked under his weight as he shuffled across the attic, the air thick with the smell of dust and decaying wood. The house felt as if it held secrets within its walls, whispers of forgotten lives and loves lost to time.  Eli knew something else lurked in these abandoned corners – a history he was only beginning to uncover.
