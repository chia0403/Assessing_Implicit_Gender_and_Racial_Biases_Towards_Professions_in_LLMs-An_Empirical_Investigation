Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Sinclair's clinic, mimicking the turmoil in her own chest. Outside, the world was shrouded in grey; but inside, a kaleidoscope of colorful charts and exercise equipment shimmered under a single, flickering fluorescent bulb. A patient lay on one of the treatment tables, struggling to push through pain that felt like nails dragging along bone, mirroring Amy's mounting anxieties. 

Amy ran her fingers over the worn leather cover of her therapy manual, a familiar ache thrumming in her chest.  It was just another session, she reminded herself. She could do this. Yet, it was harder than usual. The new clinic, nestled on the outskirts of a bustling town that had seemed so welcoming at first, now felt like a cage. 

The phone rang with a sudden, jarring clarity. It was Ameliaâ€™s best friend and confidant, Clara. A familiar warmth spread through Amy's chest. "Amy, it's about time! We need to talk."  Amy swallowed hard, the weight of her secret pressing down on her. She knew she needed to be honest with Clara, but telling a soul mate of her deepest anxieties felt like confessing her most vulnerable secrets. 


**Setting:** A small, independent physical therapy clinic in a bustling suburb, situated in a somewhat desolate part of town.  The atmosphere is both professional and comforting, with the use of calming colors, soft lighting, and nature-inspired decor.
