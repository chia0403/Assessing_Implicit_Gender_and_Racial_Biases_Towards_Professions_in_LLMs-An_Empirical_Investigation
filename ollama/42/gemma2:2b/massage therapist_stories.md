## The Scent of Salt and Secrets

Rain lashed against the small storefront window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a watercolor smear of teal and pink. Inside, Amelia Reyes, the whispers-of-wisdom in her hands, ran a warm palm across the worn leather of a massage table. A storm like this was nothing new to the seaside town of Avalon, but tonight it felt different, heavier, charged with an undercurrent of hidden emotions.  The aroma of salt, sea breeze, and lavender oil hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort against the relentless rain outside.

Amelia's small practice, nestled on the cliffside where Avalon met the vast ocean, was more than just a place to knead tension away. It was a sanctuary she had built with her bare hands – literally, every inch of it. The rough-hewn walls held the memories of countless journeys and unspoken stories, each one marked by the soothing scent of sandalwood oil.  It was here, in this quiet haven where bodies were washed clean and anxieties faded, that Amelia felt most herself, a kaleidoscope of hands shaping lives, dreams, and perhaps even her own secrets. 
 
Tonight, however, Amelia's usual rhythm felt broken. A new client, shrouded in silence like a storm cloud itself, had just arrived – a tall man with the weight of his history etched on every line of his weathered face. As he sat down, a familiar shiver ran down Amelia's spine, an echo from a past she couldn’t quite remember.  A scent, sharp and unfamiliar, lingered in the air - a hint of something hidden, something dark...and dangerous.
