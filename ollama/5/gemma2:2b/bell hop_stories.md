The neon glow of "The Palace" hotel pulsed against the rain-slicked asphalt like a trapped firefly, its promise of glamour a stark contrast to the gritty reality of 1930s Chicago's South Side.  This was where Elmore “El” Jackson toiled, his crisp white suit a beacon of hope amidst the grime and longing that seemed to permeate every corner of the city.  He’d grown up on dreams as big as those towering skyscrapers, dreaming of escape - maybe one day a life beyond the endless stream of weary travelers, their faces etched with hardship, who passed through The Palace like ghosts in a sea of neon and steel. 

El’s current task was to retrieve Mr. Thorne's luggage from Mrs. Henderson's suite on the top floor.  His shift had been long and his feet were aching as he lugged the heavy bag up the winding staircase, each step echoing in the silence between whispers of forgotten lives and hidden desires.  The air hung thick with the scent of cheap perfume and old ambition - a mix that reminded El of the dreams swirling in his own mind: escaping this life, maybe finding a place where hope was not a luxury but an inherent right for every human being.
