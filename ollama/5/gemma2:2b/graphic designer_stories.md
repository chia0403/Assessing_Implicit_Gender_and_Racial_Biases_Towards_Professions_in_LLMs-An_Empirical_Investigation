## The Paper Ghost

**Setting:**  The city of Prague, Bohemia - a place where history whispers from every cobblestone and the air hums with an old-world magic. 

**Main Character:** Elara "Ellie" Káranová, 27 years young, dreams of making her mark in the world. Not through grand gestures or social climbing, but through the silent power of design – she's a graphic designer who believes words and images can change the way people see things. Her studio is nestled in a cozy old building on the outskirts of Prague’s Old Town Square, its windows framed by wrought-iron balconies, allowing a glimpse into a world of swirling colours and fonts. 

**Story Opening:**

The whirring of Ellie's vintage electric typewriter was the only sound that broke the silence, punctuated occasionally by the quiet click-clack of her fingers on the keys as she typed. Her head was buried in an old document, its paper brittle with age - a collection of handwritten notes from her grandmother, a renowned architect who had left behind not just blueprints and sketches but also a legacy of words that Ellie desperately sought to decipher.  She hadn't even finished writing down the last page when she heard it: a faint, almost imperceptible tapping sound coming from outside her studio window. 

Ellie paused, her eyes glued to the paper, then turned towards the window, curiosity battling with apprehension. The faint tapping had stopped, and all that remained was a single, white feather against the cold glass of the windowpane.  It looked almost as if it were floating in the air – as if someone or something was trying to speak to her from beyond the boundaries of reality itself. 

Ellie's grandmother was known for her eccentric theories about the nature of design and its power over human perception. Ellie, however, had never believed anything of the sort - until now. As she looked at the feather, a feeling of unease settled on her like a shroud. This was no ordinary feather; this was an invitation to something more, something that felt as timeless as Prague itself.
