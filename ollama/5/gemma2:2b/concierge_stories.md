Rain hammered against the grand glass windows of The Astor Estate, each drop an icy shard falling into the sea of swirling grey outside.  Inside, nestled in the heart of the opulent mansion's foyer, Amelia Hawthorne felt the weight of another day. Her silver-tipped cane tapped rhythmically on the worn Persian rug as she surveyed the chaos that was unfolding - a misplaced tiara, a frantic call from a disgruntled guest, and a spilled vintage champagne that threatened to stain the polished oak floor.  

Amelia, with her sharp wit and an aura of quiet authority honed over years of service in this prestigious hotel, had been the guardian of The Astor Estate for nearly two decades. Every creak in the grand staircase, every echo in the expansive library, held within it stories whispered down through generations - tales that Amelia knew as well as the beating of her own heart. Tonight, however, even her seasoned eyes couldn't help but be pulled towards the newest guest, a young woman named Evelyn Thorne with a sadness so profound it mirrored the stormy sky outside.

Evelyn was a newcomer in every sense:  an enigmatic artist whose canvas seemed to spill its secrets onto the walls of The Astor Estate, only for them to be lost in the relentless rain that hammered against the windows. Amelia's gaze lingered on her; a solitary figure, clutching a paint-stained sketchpad and staring out at the storm with an intensity that threatened to swallow her whole.
