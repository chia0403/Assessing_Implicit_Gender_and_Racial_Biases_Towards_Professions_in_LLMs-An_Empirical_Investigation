##  The Drippy City 

**Setting:** The rain was relentless, battering down on the grimy streets of New Elysium, a city where pipes overflowed with dreams and despair in equal measure. Graffiti clung to crumbling brick walls like stubborn grime, and neon signs flickered promises of fortune amidst the perpetual drizzle. A humid haze hung over the city, swallowing the sounds of car horns, construction noises, and distant sirens into an indistinguishable symphony of chaos.

**Main character:** Bartholomew "Barty" Fitzwilliam, was a man who'd never known sunshine. Not in his life, at least. At 32, he had spent more time battling leaks and burst pipes than escaping the relentless grip of New Elysium's unforgiving weather. A burly figure with calloused hands and eyes as blue as the city's forgotten water faucets, Barty was a plumber by trade and an enigma in his own right. 

Barty gripped his wrench, the familiar feel grounding him amidst the swirling chaos. He stared at the overflowing sink, a torrent of murky water cascading down the cracked porcelain like tears in a silent movie. Each leak was a story, each burst pipe a testament to the city's hidden anxieties. As he surveyed the mess, Barty couldn't shake off the feeling that this wasn't just another call - there was something deeper, something more sinister beneath the grime. 


**And then, from behind the sink, a voice echoed through the small room, dry as dust and laced with an unsettling urgency: "Don't you know what time it is, Barty?"**
