The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air as Amelia "Amy" Davenport's phone rang. The call came with a jarring clatter that echoed through her cramped office in Chicago's bustling Loop.  She glanced at the caller ID: **International Air & Beyond.** It was Mr. Patel, usually a patient soul with a penchant for long, meandering email replies, but today, his voice crackled with urgency. 

"Amy," he rasped, "I have a problem." Amy sighed, knowing this wasn't going to be good news. The world, after all, was full of problems. Especially in the travel industry these days.  She pulled a worn copy of *Atlas Obscura* off her desk and braced herself as Mr. Patel launched into his tale - a lost suitcase, a delayed flight, and an entire itinerary ripped apart by a rogue wave of... well, chaos. 

It was set to be the honeymoon for Amelia’s most prized client: a young couple on their way to a tropical island paradise in the Bahamas, where the sun shone a relentless and dazzling promise every day. But as Amy looked out at the endless gray skyline of Chicago, she wondered if the real challenge wasn't navigating the sea of chaos, but in keeping her clients’ dreams afloat.
