Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Harold "Hawk" Carter's pickup truck, the windshield wipers struggling to keep up with the downpour.  The wind howled around him, whipping the droplets off his worn-out work boots. The small town of Ridgeway was practically submerged in a sea of mud and rainwater, and Hawk knew he wouldn't be able to make it back to his cozy cabin until the storm subsided. 

He squinted at the rickety wooden shed in the center of the lot next to him - the kind that seemed designed to collapse under the slightest pressure. The owner, a gruff old man named Jebediah, had promised to send Hawk down to fix the leaky roof when the weather cleared.  But this was Ridgeway, and everything about their lives revolved around nature's whims. 

Hawk tugged at his beanie and pulled it lower over his face, trying to shield himself from the cold as he hopped out of the truck. The air hung thick with a mixture of damp earth and the metallic tang of rainwater.  He glanced up, taking in the storm-tossed silhouette of Jebediah's house, a solitary beacon against the unrelenting deluge. He sighed, knowing that just getting to his friend would be an epic battle against the elements.
