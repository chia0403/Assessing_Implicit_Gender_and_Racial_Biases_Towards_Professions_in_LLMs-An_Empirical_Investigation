The salt-laced wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Thistlewick's wool coat as she trudged through the biting Antarctic blizzard. The snow stung her cheeks, each flake an icy needle prickling her skin, but she wouldn’t dare stop.  She was responsible for a hundred lives – or rather, a hundred pairs of eyes that waited patiently in their wire-mesh enclosures at the heart of the frozen wilderness. 

Amy was no stranger to this unforgiving landscape. Her job as caretaker at the South Pole Research Station was a constant struggle against the elements, but she thrived on it.  The snowdrifts piled high against the station's metal walls felt more like a friend than an enemy. The icy wind that howled outside was just a reminder of the silent beauty and raw power of nature around her. This vast white expanse offered no solace, yet held a quiet, almost poetic majesty that Amy cherished. 

Today, however, something felt different. A strange unease prickled at the edges of her mind.  A low rumble echoed through the icy air, like an ancient beast shifting its weight on the frozen earth. The penguins, usually so animated and playful, huddled closer to their nests, their chirps now a subdued chorus of uncertainty. 

The unsettling feeling was more than just the approaching storm; it had something to do with the animals.  Something felt… off.
