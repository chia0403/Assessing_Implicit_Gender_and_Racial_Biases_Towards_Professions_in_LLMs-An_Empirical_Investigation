He'd pulled his share of greasy burgers and cheap coffee from its griddle-stained counter, watching local legends spill out over steaming mugs as they swapped tales of highway mishaps and near-misses with other travelers. But tonight was different. Tonight felt… charged. The air crackled, not just with the static hum of a rumbling engine, but with an undercurrent of unease.
