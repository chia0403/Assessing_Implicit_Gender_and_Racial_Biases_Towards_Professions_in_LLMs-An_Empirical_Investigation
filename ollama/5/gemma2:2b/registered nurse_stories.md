The air in the hospital smelled of bleach and something faintly metallic – the kind of smell that clung to you like an unwelcome guest after a particularly harrowing night shift.  Amelia "Amy" Harding, RN, adjusted her stethoscope around her neck, trying to ignore the persistent tremor in her fingers.  Tonight was different. Tonight, she wasn't just navigating a sea of charts and hushed anxieties; tonight, she felt something akin to dread crawl up her spine.

The flickering fluorescent lights painted long shadows across the sterile white walls of Room 302. It was late, well past midnight, and the only sound in the usually frantic symphony of beeping monitors and murmuring doctors was the rhythmic hum of a lone air conditioner battling the humid summer night.  Amy's eyes followed a familiar path – from the cracked IV stand to the worn-out leather chair where Mrs. Evans lay hooked up to various tubes and machines. The once vibrant woman, now confined within those four walls, seemed a pale imitation of her former self. 

Amy felt like a ship adrift in an ocean of unanswered questions.  The diagnosis was as bleak as it could get – terminal lung cancer, aggressive, no sign of remission. Mrs. Evans's husband, Arthur, sat slumped in the chair next to her bed, his face etched with grief and exhaustion. He wouldn’t look at Amy, his gaze fixed on the empty space where her presence should be. The weight of his unspoken burden – a silent acknowledgment of her helplessness – crashed down on Amy's shoulders. This wasn't just another patient; it was a woman she had grown to know, a life she had been entrusted with, and now, a life slipping away.
