The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a pale, sterile sheen over the waiting room. It was 7:15 AM on a Wednesday morning, and Ms. Evelyn Everly-Taylor, DMDH (Doctor of Dental Hygiene - Hygienist), already had her day mapped out in her mind like a well-oiled machine. She had one patient scheduled for each hour slot after 8 AM.  

Ms. Evelyn's calming presence was something many patients appreciated. "You know," she’d say, as she gently lifted the headrest for Mrs. Henderson, “Sometimes even the biggest worries can be brushed away.” She believed in a gentle touch and a kind word to soothe anxieties before tackling anything else. The aroma of pine-scented dental cleaner clung to the air like an old friend, offering a familiar comfort in the otherwise sterile environment. 

However, as Ms. Evelyn scanned the waiting room's usual collection of anxious faces, a new figure caught her eye. It was a young man, dressed in worn-out clothes and carrying a battered suitcase. He looked lost and burdened with a melancholic aura that seemed to seep into the already somber atmosphere.
