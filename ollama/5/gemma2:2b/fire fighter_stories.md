The scent of pine needles and burnt wood clung to the air like a phantom memory as Chief Amelia "Amy" Carter stepped out onto the porch of the fire station.  A cold wind whipped through the Adirondack pines surrounding the building, sending shivers down her spine despite the heavy fleece jacket she wore. It was November in Lakeview - a time of quiet beauty, but one where even the crisp air felt laced with a melancholic urgency. 

The snow had started to fall earlier this week, blanketing the small town in a peaceful white silence that Amy found both comforting and unnerving. The falling snow mirrored her own internal state â€“ calm on the surface, yet churning beneath. She hadn't wanted to come back here after her deployment overseas; her family's quiet life in Lakeview felt like another life altogether.  But duty called, as it always did, and now she was stuck with a mountain of paperwork, an empty house with boarded-up windows, and the gnawing feeling that something was amiss.
