## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Evelyn Ainsworth's classroom, each drop echoing like a tiny drumbeat in the quiet space. Inside, the room was awash in the soft orange glow of afternoon sunlight, filtering through the stained-glass windows depicting scenes from classic fairytales.  Mrs. Ainsworth watched with a weary smile as her fifth-grade class huddled around their desks, each one attempting to ignore the howling wind outside. 

**Character Name:** Mrs. Evelyn Ainsworth (often called "Miss Ainsworth" or "Ev") by her students.

**Setting:** Mrs. Ainsworth's classroom in a rural elementary school nestled amidst rolling hills and dense woodlands. The town has barely any industry, relying on agriculture and the occasional tourist who visits the nearby state park known for its picturesque waterfalls and hiking trails. The year is 1975, and technology remains nascent - the nearest television is at the local public library with limited programming hours.  


**Possible next lines:**

* Miss Ainsworth's smile wavered as she remembered the last day of school before a harsh winter.
* She looked around the room at her students - their faces a blur of tired excitement, anticipation for summer vacation. 
* A single thought lingered in the back of her mind - an old legend about hidden treasure that had been whispered amongst her students ever since they were just small children.
