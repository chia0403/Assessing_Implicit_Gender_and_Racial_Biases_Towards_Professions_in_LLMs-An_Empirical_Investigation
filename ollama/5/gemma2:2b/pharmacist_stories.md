The salty air whipped Amelia’s auburn hair across her face as she stood on the rocky pier. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in fiery oranges and reds that bled into the indigo depths of the ocean.  Her weathered leather gloves clung to the worn handle of her antique satchel, its contents clinking like a nervous heartbeat against her hip - not exactly what you'd expect for a pharmacist. It wasn't just any pharmacy, however; it was "Corium Apothecary", nestled amongst the bustling stalls of Port Haven’s marketplace. The town itself, shrouded in a perpetual fog that clung to its streets like a whispered secret, felt both vibrant and melancholic – a feeling Amelia understood all too well. 

She adjusted her spectacles and took a deep breath.  The air held a unique scent; a blend of brine and old wood, with a hint of something...unknown. A low moan echoed through the fog-laden air. The seagulls squawked in agreement from the distant pier. This was Amelia’s life - blending the practical world of medicine with the mystic undercurrents of Port Haven's lore.
