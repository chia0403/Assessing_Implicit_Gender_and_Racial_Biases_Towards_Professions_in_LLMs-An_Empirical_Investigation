The wind whipped across Caleb Whitman's weathered face, carrying with it the scent of dust and sagebrush. His gaze was fixed on the parched earth stretching out before him as far as his eye could see, a sea of cracked brown beneath the relentless sun.  He ran a calloused thumb over the worn leather strap of his bolo knife, the familiar weight grounding him in the vast emptiness of the Wyoming plains. It had been three days since rain fell on their ranch, Three Days' Hollow. And three long, agonizing days that felt like an eternity. 

Caleb was born and raised under a sky this vast, its power both a blessing and a burden. He understood the language of these plains better than he ever knew human speech. The whispers of wind in the pines, the croaking chorus of crickets, the silent stoicism of the cattle – all spoke a constant rhythm, one he was learning to decipher with his whole being.  Now, as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of blood orange and fiery red, the only sound that dared challenge the silence was the lowing of the herd at the edge of their range. 

Caleb's family had held onto this land for generations – a legacy built on sweat, grit, and endless faith in these wild plains. He knew what it meant to carry the weight of those legacies on his shoulders.  But today, even he was forced to admit that the weight felt unbearable. The drought had taken its toll, and with it, a growing sense of despair gnawed at the edges of his heart.
