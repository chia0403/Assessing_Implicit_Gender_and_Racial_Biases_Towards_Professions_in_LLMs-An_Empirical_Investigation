## The Case of the Missing Manuscript:

**Setting:**  A cramped, bustling office in the heart of downtown Chicago, 2023.  Sunlight slants through dusty windows onto Amelia "Amy" Reed's desk, highlighting the stacks of legal documents that tower around her like miniature Mount Olympus. 

**Character:** Amy Reed, a paralegal with an uncanny ability to understand the nuanced legal language and find meaning in messy files. She is sharp as a tack and twice as determined, fueled by an insatiable curiosity about justice served cold.  She's haunted by a past case – a wrongful death that left her questioning every step of the process – a lingering scar she tries to soothe with caffeine and copious amounts of law books.

**Opening:** 
A wave of nausea washed over Amy as she stared at the crumpled paper clutched in her hand. The words on the document swam before her eyes: *“Confession made under duress,”* scrawled across a page that was, just moments ago, filled with meticulous documentation detailing the contract for a software development company's latest project. 

"The hell?" she muttered, dropping the paper onto the desk. It looked like an inside job – the entire document was hastily scribbled and then crumpled into a useless ball, as if someone had been desperately trying to destroy anything that could be used against them.  But who would do such a thing? And why? 

The clock on her wall ticked with unsettling precision, each click sounding like the slow death of a dying hope. It was just another Friday afternoon, but this case felt different. The weight of it all – the missing manuscript, the crumpled paper, and the unspoken tension in her office - pressed down on Amy, making it feel as though the walls were closing in on her.  Today felt like a turning point, an abrupt, unsettling shift into a new chapter she didn’t quite understand yet.

Amy was about to dive into the case when a sharp knock resonated through the door, followed by a voice that chilled her to the bone.

"Miss Reed?" The young lawyer at the end of the hallway, Liam Collins, stood nervously in the doorway, his face pale and etched with concern.  "We've got a situation."
