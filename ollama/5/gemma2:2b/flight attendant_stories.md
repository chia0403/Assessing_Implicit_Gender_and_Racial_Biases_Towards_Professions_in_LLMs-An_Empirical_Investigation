##  The Crimson Sky 

**Setting:** A bustling, chaotic hub at JFK International Airport in New York City, 1978. The air throbbed with the energy of thousands of people rushing from one point to another. 

**Main Character:** Amelia "Amy" Hayes - a flight attendant for Northwest Airlines.  Her heart beat a steady rhythm against her ribs, a familiar soundtrack as she navigated the airport's labyrinthine terminals. At 28, Amy was young and vibrant, with a mop of auburn hair constantly escaping its ponytail and eyes that seemed to hold both weariness and an underlying spark of excitement.

**Opening:**  The worn mahogany desk in the galley felt cool beneath her hand as she took out a pen and scribbled down another "Delayed" note on the daily passenger log. The faint aroma of stale coffee mingled with the acrid scent of jet fuel, a familiar cocktail that had become synonymous with Amy's life since she began her work at Northwest Airlines over five years ago.  Outside, the skies were a riot of crimson and gold - sunset bleeding into twilight - casting long shadows across the bustling terminal floor. The roar of the approaching planes seemed amplified today, a symphony of power and frustration as Amelia watched passengers grow impatient, their voices rising in a crescendo of discontent. 

"Another one," Amy muttered to herself, "Just another Tuesday."  A sigh escaped her lips, a sound swallowed by the cacophony of the airport. The promise of a long flight, a chance to escape this concrete jungle and soar amongst the clouds, was still weeks away.  For now, she had endless rows of passengers to attend to, each one a story waiting to be unfolded.
