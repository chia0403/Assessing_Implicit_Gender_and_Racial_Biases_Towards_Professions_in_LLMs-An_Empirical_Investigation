Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of the city outside into a hazy smear of orange and blue. The stale scent of coffee and old cigarettes hung heavy in the air, mingling with the damp chill of the November wind that rattled the flimsy cardboard door frame.  His gaze drifted to the half-eaten bag of doughnuts on his desk - the only evidence he had from their last case, a particularly frustrating night spent chasing shadows and empty promises. 

This was a new kind of mess; something far more personal than usual. 

The note lay tucked beneath an old cigar box, its stark black font against the white paper like a splash of ink in the vast emptiness of his desk. It simply read: *Find her before sunrise.* Then, below that,  a single scarlet rose with thorns, carefully trimmed and displayed on a plain sheet of paper. 

"What kind of criminal sends flowers as an insult?" Bart muttered to himself, rubbing the weary lines etched deep into his face. He knew this was no ordinary job; there was something deeply personal, almost desperate, about this case that sent shivers down his spine. His intuition screamed of a tangled web of secrets and buried desires. 

The air in the city felt thick tonight, heavy with the weight of unspoken anxieties. The clock on the wall ticked mercilessly, each second an echo of time running out.  Bartâ€™s mind was already racing; he knew this wasn't just about finding "her," but about unraveling the tangled threads of a case that threatened to expose something far more dangerous than just a missing person. 
 
His finger hovered over his phone, a familiar pang of anxiety gnawing at him. The name, "Evelyn Thorne," flashed across the screen: an elusive trail leading into the heart of the city's dark underbelly.  He took a deep breath, the rain pounding against the windowpane like a drummer on drumsticks. 


Bart Finch was going to find her, no matter what it cost him.
