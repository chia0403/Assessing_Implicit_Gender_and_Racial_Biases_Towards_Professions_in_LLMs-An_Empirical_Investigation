The musty scent of aged paper and leather clung to Amelia "Amy" Blackwood like a second skin.  Her office was a haven amongst the chaos of the Blackwood Library - a sprawling Victorian mansion hidden away in a quiet corner of the city. The mahogany shelves, groaning under the weight of centuries-old tomes, lined every inch of the room; the air hummed with hushed whispers and the rhythmic clicking of antique clocks. Outside, the afternoon sun dipped towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of crimson and rose as Amy meticulously dusted a particularly ancient volume about Norse mythology. 

Today, however, a storm was brewing outside, not just a literal one. The wind howled through the cracked windows, rattling the old panes like ghostly fingers clawing at the edges of reality. Inside, the air crackled with an unease that felt as tangible as the dust motes dancing in the fading sunlight. 

Amy couldn't shake off the feeling of something amiss. A shiver snaked down her spine, and she glanced over the worn leather cover of a first edition copy of Edgar Allan Poe’s “The Fall of the House of Usher.” The title felt more like a grim omen than an intriguing subject for study that day.
