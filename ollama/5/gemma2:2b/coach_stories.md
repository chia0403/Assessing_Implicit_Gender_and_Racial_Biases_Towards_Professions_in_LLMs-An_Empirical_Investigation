The air hung heavy with humidity and the tang of chlorine.  Miles away from his sprawling family farm in Iowa, Adrian "Ady" Thompson, head coach of the University's fledgling swim team, felt like he was drowning.  He stared down at the glistening pool where his team, the Wildcats, were struggling against the formidable force of the Sharks, rivals who had been crushing them for decades. 

Ady gripped the edge of the pool deck, knuckles turning white. Years ago, he'd built this program from nothing - a ragtag bunch of misfits and self-doubt. Now, his dream was being threatened by their ruthless dominance. The tension in the air crackled like static electricity. He could hear the roar of the crowd, but it felt muffled, distant, swallowed by the weight of his responsibility. 

He glanced at his team, their faces reflecting a mixture of frustration and defiance.  His heart ached for them, these young athletes who were willing to push themselves beyond their perceived limits, yet couldn't quite break through the wall that seemed to be insurmountable.
