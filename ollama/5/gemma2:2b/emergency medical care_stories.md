## Story Opening: The Midnight Shift

**Setting:** A dilapidated hospital in a forgotten corner of Chicago, late 1970s.  Run-down hallways echo with the creaks of the aged structure. The air hangs thick with the scent of disinfectant and stale sweat. 

**Characters:**

* **Ethan Blackwood**, a young emergency medical technician (EMT) known for his quick thinking and even quicker temper,  navigates the chaotic world of medical emergencies.


The clock ticked past midnight, each second a hammer blow against Ethan's weary soul as he stared at the endless stream of beeping monitors in the control room. The city outside was bathed in a moonless blanket of rain, reflecting the storm brewing inside him. Just another Friday night in Chicago, he thought, but tonight felt different. Tonight felt like the beginning of something bigger, something darker. 

A sharp, almost-discernible thump from the third floor echoed through the room. It was followed by a frantic call: "Code Blue on the fifth floor, report now!" Ethan's pulse quickened. A code blue always meant chaos. But tonight, something about the urgency felt different, sharper than usual. 


He donned his coat and pulled the brim of his cap down over his eyes as he stepped out into the night, a lone figure in a sea of shadows. The hospital stood silent, a stark silhouette against the oppressive darkness. A shiver ran down Ethan's spine as he knew this was more than just another shift; it felt like something had awakened in the city's heart and was ready to claw its way out into the night.
