## Story Opening: 

The scent of citrus and jasmine hung heavy in the air, a sweet but potent perfume that clung to the worn leather upholstery of Luna Nightingale's salon.  A late afternoon sun streamed through the stained glass windowpanes, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the pristine surfaces of her workspace.  Luna, all sharp angles and auburn hair pulled back into a tight bun, moved with practiced ease as she applied a light layer of foundation to a client’s pale cheeks. 

“You have the most luminous skin,” Luna sighed, tracing a fingertip over the woman’s smooth porcelain complexion. "It's almost unnerving.”  Her words were meant to be comforting, yet they seemed to hang in the air like a warning, leaving a bitter taste on Amelia’s tongue. 

**Setting:** A small, secluded salon hidden away on a quiet street corner in the heart of San Francisco’s historic Castro district. Luna's clientele was primarily LGBTQ+ individuals looking for something more than just a haircut; they sought her unique blend of artistic vision and intimate understanding to truly express their truest selves. 

**Main Character:**  Luna Nightingale, a gifted cosmetologist known for her bold color choices, unconventional cuts, and an almost uncanny ability to understand the soul's hidden desires through her clients’ eyes.
