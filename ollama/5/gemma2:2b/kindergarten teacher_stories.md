## The Littlest Lighthouse Keeper

**Setting:** A quaint, colorful island with craggy cliffs, emerald-green fields dotted with wildflowers, and a harbor teeming with boats. The year is 1980. 

**Main Character:**  Esmeralda “Em” Thistlewick, her auburn hair always tied back in a messy bun that seemed to defy gravity, a perpetual smudge of watercolor paint on her cheek from a recent crafting session with her students.  She stood at the helm of her little red rowboat as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and violet. 

“The Little Lighthouse,” Em muttered, gently rocking the boat back and forth. Her island was home to The Little Lighthouse, a beacon nestled on a rocky outcrop that shone its comforting light through the thick fog every night. Tonight, however, the lighthouse’s glow had been dimmed – a strange fog had settled over the land, casting shadows that stretched for miles. 

Em pulled out her tattered notebook from her satchel and started to write, her pencil scratching against the pages. There was a rhythm to it, an almost hypnotic dance of words. “Tonight,” she wrote, “the wind is holding secrets.”
