Rain lashed against the attic windows of the Victorian house like tiny fists pounding on wood. Inside, huddled amongst dusty volumes and cobwebbed furniture, sat Amelia Croft.  Her fingers hovered above the keyboard, each tap echoing through the cavernous space as if she was alone in the world. Her laptop, perched precariously atop a stack of ancient tomes, reflected the flickering glow of the streetlamps outside in a distorted dance of light and shadow. 

Amelia Croft had always found solace in words. As an author, her imagination blossomed on the blank pages of her manuscripts, weaving worlds where dragons roamed free and love bloomed amidst the ruins of fallen empires. Yet, real life rarely mirrored the magic that she conjured up in fiction. The city of San Anselmo was a concrete jungle, its streets choked with traffic and its people as anonymous as the faceless shadows passing by her window. 

The silence broken only by the rhythmic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard and the distant wail of the wind outside, Amelia took a deep breath. Tonight, she would write about escape, about finding solace in stories that could transport even the most jaded soul. And maybe, just maybe, she'd find some spark of real life magic too.
