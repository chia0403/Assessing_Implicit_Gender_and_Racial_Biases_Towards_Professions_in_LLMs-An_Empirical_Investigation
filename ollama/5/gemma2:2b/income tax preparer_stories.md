The scent of stale coffee and printer ink hung heavy in the air as Amelia "Amy" Lawson meticulously organized her pile of tax forms. Each year, she faced the same familiar chaos: mountains of receipts, confusing schedules, and a never-ending stream of anxious clients, all hoping for some semblance of order amidst the fiscal storm. Her office was crammed into a tiny corner storefront in a bustling strip mall, bathed in the pale fluorescent light that seemed to amplify the weight of paperwork around her. 

The year was 2043, and with automation replacing many jobs, Amy's role as an income tax preparer felt even more precarious than usual. She knew the government’s foray into a universal basic income had softened the blow for some, but she witnessed it daily: the growing anxiety and simmering resentment that often accompanied tax season. 

It wasn't just about numbers and spreadsheets; Amy believed in the human story behind each form. Each year, she found herself connecting with her clients – their dreams of homeownership, hopes for a brighter future – even as the world around them teetered on the edge of change.
