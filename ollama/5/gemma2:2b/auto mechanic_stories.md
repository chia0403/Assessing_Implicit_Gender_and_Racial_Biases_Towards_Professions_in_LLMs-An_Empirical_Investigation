The engine coughed, wheezing like a disgruntled old man trying to catch his breath.  Sweat stung Ethan Blackwood’s eyes as he wrestled with the stubborn piston, its metal limbs resisting his every attempt at cooperation. The air in the cramped garage was thick with oil and grease, punctuated by the rhythmic symphony of clanging wrenches and the whine of a faulty fan. It was dusk outside, casting long, skeletal shadows across the workshop, mimicking the tangled mess of wires and pipes strewn across the workbench. Ethan squinted through his dusty goggles as he shifted his weight on the greasy floor, wondering if he'd ever be able to decipher this particular engine’s cryptic desires. 

**Setting:** Blackwood's Garage - a ramshackle haven for classic cars nestled amidst a maze of backstreets in old town, where time seemed to move at its own pace.  It was an eclectic mix of worn and rusty parts, salvaged tools, and the faint scent of past triumphs and mechanical heartbreak. 

**Main character:** Ethan Blackwood, a man hardened by years spent under the hood, whose hands were more familiar with grease than words, and whose heart beat to the rhythm of pistons and valves.
