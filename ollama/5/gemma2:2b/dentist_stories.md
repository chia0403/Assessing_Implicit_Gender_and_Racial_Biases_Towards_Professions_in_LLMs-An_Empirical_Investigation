The midday sun beat down on Dr. Theodore "Ted" Beaumont's practice. Not only was his building in the heart of bustling Maplewood, but he also had a patio where patients could sit for their check-ups while sipping iced tea or coffee. It was an attempt at making the otherwise sterile environment feel more welcoming, though Ted himself felt anything but relaxed. He’d been staring out the window at the swirling, crimson sunset since his last patient left, and it only magnified the knot of anxiety in his stomach. This appointment was different. 

It wasn't just that Mrs. Henderson had always been particularly difficult; her sharp-tongued complaints about 'the younger generation' and 'uninspired smiles,' usually accompanied by a generous portion of criticism directed at Ted himself, were starting to feel like a personal attack.  No, this time it was the reason for the visit. 

It wasn’t just Mrs. Henderson's anxiety; it was a feeling that thrummed through every fiber of Ted's being. The day he had chosen to accept his father’s legacy - to become a dentist in the same building where his own father had practiced, after serving in the army - had been an emotionally charged one.  His father's passing just two years ago left a void that felt impossible to fill. 

The quiet hum of the fluorescent lights and the whirring of the dental drill seemed almost deafening now. The only sound louder was his racing heart, which was starting to feel like a drum solo against his ribcage.
