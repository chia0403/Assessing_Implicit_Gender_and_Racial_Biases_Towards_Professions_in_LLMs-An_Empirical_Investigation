Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the Greyhound Cafe, each drop like a tiny drumbeat in Amelia "Ami"  Bell's ears. The air hung thick with smoke and stale coffee, punctuated by the low thrum of Ella Fitzgerald on the radio, each note echoing the melancholy settling in Ami's chest. She stared out at the rain-slicked streets of New Orleans, a city that never slept, yet seemed to hold its breath tonight, waiting for something... anything.  

Ami was known as "The Nightingale" in these smoky corners of the city.  Her voice, raw and vibrant like an untamed bird, could soothe frayed nerves or stir the soul. Tonight, though, Ami felt hollow, her heart a cage of silence against the cacophony of rain and rhythm. The gig at the Bourbon Street saloon was just another night in this chaotic symphony; but tonight, something felt off, a discordant note that sent shivers down her spine.  A single spotlight flickered on the stage, casting an eerie glow on Ami's battered guitar. She closed her eyes, picturing herself stepping onto that stage, letting the music flow through her veins, until the notes became a story. A story she was desperately hoping to tell tonight, before the shadows swallowed the city whole.
