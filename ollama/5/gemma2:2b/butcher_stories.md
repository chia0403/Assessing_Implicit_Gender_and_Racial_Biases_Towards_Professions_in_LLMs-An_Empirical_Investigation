The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and aged leather, a familiar aroma that clung to Arthur Blackwood like his own shadow. His shop, "Blackwood's Provisions," was nestled in the heart of  Littlehaven, its wooden door worn smooth by generations of hands reaching out for his expertise. The setting sun cast long shadows across the cobbled street, painting the scene with fiery hues of orange and crimson as Arthur surveyed the day's bounty – a freshly slain boar lay on the slab, awaiting its final transformation. 

His wife, Agnes, had left earlier that day to tend to their younger daughter, Elsie, who was feverish from a bout of illness, but the familiar sting of loneliness lingered in his chest nonetheless. He'd lost his eldest son to a fever a year ago; the weight of it was more than just grief – it felt like a physical presence at his elbow, a constant ache in the pit of his stomach. 

But there was something else: a sense of hope flickering within him. A delivery had arrived earlier that morning - a shipment from the west coast, promising exotic spices and rare cuts of meat. His shop hadn't seen such an influx in years, and Arthur's heart thrummed with anticipation. Maybe, just maybe, this was the spark to rekindle the old flame within him, to remind himself that life wasn't just about loss and regret.
