The late afternoon sun bled through the stained-glass window of Dr. Eleanor Hayes' office, painting squares of colour across the floor.  It was a calming spectacle, but the vibrant hues did little to ease the knot in Eleanor's stomach as she looked at the file on her desk: 18-year-old Liam O'Connell, with his spastic quadriplegia, who was struggling to adjust to life after a debilitating accident.

Eleanor's office, tucked away on the second floor of the Community Wellness Centre, felt like a small sanctuary amidst the chaos of life in Oakhaven.  Oakhaven wasn't exactly bustling - more of a quiet village nestled amongst rolling hills and dotted with sprawling old-growth trees. It was here that Eleanor worked, nurturing the physical and emotional needs of its residents, using the gentle power of touch to help them rediscover movement and resilience. 

But today, something felt different.  Liam's file wasn't just another case; it held the weight of a silent plea for help, a desperate yearning to reclaim some semblance of his lost life. Eleanor took a deep breath, adjusting the thick-rimmed glasses perched on her nose, and began to work.
