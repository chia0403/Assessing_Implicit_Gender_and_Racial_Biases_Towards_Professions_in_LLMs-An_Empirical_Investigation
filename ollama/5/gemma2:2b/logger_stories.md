Silas Hemlock, his weathered face illuminated by the orange glow of sunrise, pulled on his thick leather gloves and surveyed the clearing. He whistled a sour tune, the sound swallowed by the vast silence of the forest.  The air held the sharp tang of freshly cut wood and a lingering scent of pine needles. 

This was his world - a sprawling expanse of towering trees that stretched towards the horizon, their limbs gnarled and ancient as the heart of the forest itself. He'd been hauling logs for over three decades, carving a life from the wilderness, each day feeling like a step in the long dance between man and nature. His lumberyard stood at the edge of this silent kingdom, its weathered wood reflecting the sky like an old, forgotten memory. Silas was a logger, born and bred among the towering giants, his life woven into the fabric of these ancient woods. But something felt off today, the usual hum of the forest tinged with a note of unease.
