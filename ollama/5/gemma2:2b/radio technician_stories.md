The static crackled to life on the receiver in Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's cluttered workshop, pulling her from a dream where giant radios hummed with unseen power. Her heart thumped against her ribs as she twisted a dial on a vintage tube amplifier, its brass casing warm beneath her fingers. Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Ridge buzzed with its usual morning routine – lawnmowers roaring, children's laughter echoing down the quiet streets, and Mrs. Henderson’s cat, Whiskers, strutting up and down the porch like an emperor surveying his domain. But inside Amy's workshop, the only sound was the faint hiss of cooling transformers and the rhythmic click-clack of her worn leather toolbox. 

Amy had spent years honing her craft - rewinding old radios, coaxing life back into discarded electronics, even building custom amplifiers from scratch.  She was known for her uncanny ability to find a solution where others saw only a tangle of wires. Tonight, however, she felt a different kind of anticipation, the air thick with unspoken possibilities as if the very walls held secrets waiting to be unearthed.  The radio on the workbench crackled once more, this time with a burst of static that morphed into a faint, rhythmic melody. This was no ordinary broadcast - it was something more, something that hummed with an otherworldly resonance.
