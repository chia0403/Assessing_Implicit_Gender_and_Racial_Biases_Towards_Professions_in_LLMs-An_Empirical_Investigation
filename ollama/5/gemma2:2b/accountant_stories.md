Rain hammered against the arched windows of Bartholomew's office, turning the normally crisp air of London into a swirling grey mass. The thunder roared like a beast chained in some subterranean prison, echoing through the antique-stuffed walls and sending goosebumps prickling across Bartholomew’s skin. He was hunched over his desk, meticulously balancing entries on a ledger as old as time itself, the worn leather creaking with each calculated stroke of his pen.

Bartholomew "Bart" Beaumont, known to some as the meticulous genius behind the books and to others as the embodiment of Victorian stoicism, was not enjoying this stormy Tuesday afternoon. His normally tidy office, usually awash in the warm glow of candlelight and the comforting scent of aged paper, now felt suffocatingly stuffy and dark. The weight of an impending financial crisis pressed down on him like a stone slab, slowly crushing his optimism to dust. 

The rain intensified, drumming its relentless rhythm against the leaden sky as if mocking Bart's mounting anxieties. He rubbed his forehead, his long beard shaking slightly.  Tonight was the night he would finally face it – the company’s collapse and all the dreams he had built upon the bedrock of numbers were about to crumble like a house of cards.
