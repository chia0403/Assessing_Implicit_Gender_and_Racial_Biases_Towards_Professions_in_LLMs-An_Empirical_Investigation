## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** A derelict psychiatric hospital nestled amongst the overgrown hills of rural Wisconsin, its windows like vacant eyes staring out onto the unforgiving landscape. 

**Character:**  Dr. Eleanor Vance, her sharp wit and keen intellect honed over years studying the darkest recesses of human psyche, a woman who could unravel the most complicated psychological case with surgical precision, yet found herself drawn to the whispers of this forgotten place. 

**Opening:** The first day on the job. Dust motes danced in the slivers of sun that pierced through the boarded-up windows, illuminating Eleanor's worn leather briefcase nestled on the battered desk.  It had been ten years since she’d left the hallowed halls of Harvard University’s psychology department and a lifetime since this decaying asylum had held her childhood fascination. Now, under the guise of an official assessment, Dr. Vance was tasked with examining the history, and possibly, the future, of patients in these dilapidated confines. 

She ran a hand over the faded wallpaper, its once vibrant floral patterns now muted by neglect. The air hung thick with memories - unspoken confessions, hidden desires, and whispered fears that clung to the walls like cobwebs.  As she gazed around the room, her eyes caught on a tattered journal tucked away in an old chair. "The whispers..." she murmured to herself, intrigued by the cryptic note scrawled across its yellowed cover. 

Her breath quickened as the first chilling whisper seemed to drift through the air, barely audible yet undeniably potent: "He sees them all…."   


This was just the beginning. The walls held secrets. And Eleanor Vance, with her sharp mind and relentless spirit, was ready to listen.
