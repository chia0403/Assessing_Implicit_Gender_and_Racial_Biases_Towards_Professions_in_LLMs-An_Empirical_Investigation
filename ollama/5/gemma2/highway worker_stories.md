The sun, fat and orange, hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the asphalt ribbon that snaked through the desolate Arizona landscape.  Cacti stood sentinel at the roadside, their spines glistening with the remnants of a dust storm that had swept through earlier that day. The air was thick with the smell of diesel and sagebrush. This was where you'd find Daniel "Danny" Reyes, his weathered face obscured by the brim of his hardhat, meticulously patching potholes on Highway 19.  

Danny whistled along to a country song crackling from his radio, the rhythmic thump of his tamper echoing through the stillness. He squinted at the horizon, searching for any sign of life â€“ a truck lumbering by, a lost tourist wandering off course, anything besides the endless expanse of scrub and sky.
