This felt like a precipice, the moment before a storm, the hushed anticipation before the first chord of a symphony.

The scalpel gleamed under the harsh surgical lights, reflecting the worried faces of the scrub nurses who hovered anxiously around her.

Its halls were lined with whispered anxieties and silent hopes, each patient a universe unto themselves, their stories etched onto their pale skin and reflected in their tired eyes.  Eleanor had spent her life navigating these stories, dissecting fear and pain with her skilled hands, piecing together fractured bodies with the precision of a watchmaker and the compassion of a poet.
