The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Sinclair like an anxious hive, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sterile walls of the emergency room. She scrubbed her hands for the tenth time that hour, each meticulous swipe against the paper towel doing little to alleviate the knot of tension twisting in her stomach.

It was past midnight, and the ER was a symphony of chaos: the insistent beeping of monitors, the crackle of radios, and the hurried whispers of nurses battling a tide of broken bones, infected wounds, and sudden fevers. Amelia, a veteran RN with five years under her belt at Mercy Hospital, usually thrived in this controlled pandemonium. But tonight felt different.  An icy dread clung to her like a second skin, fueled by the whispered rumours circulating through the staff: a patient had arrived, his condition so dire it had shaken even the seasoned doctors.

Amelia glanced towards the trauma bay, where the curtains were drawn shut, shrouding the scene within. She knew she shouldn't peek. Yet, against her better judgement, her gaze lingered, hoping for a glimpse of light, a hint of hope amidst the brewing storm.  Whatever awaited on the other side of those thick curtains, it felt like a turning point, a moment that could irrevocably alter not just the lives of the people within the bay, but perhaps, Ameliaâ€™s own as well.
