The humid Georgia air clung to  Finnian "Finn" O'Malley like a wet blanket as he wrestled with the tangle of copper wiring in the attic of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian mansion. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom from below, casting long, distorted shadows on the cracked plaster walls. Finn swore under his breath, tugging at a particularly stubborn wire that refused to cooperate.

"This old house," he muttered, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, "has more wiring than a Christmas tree farm." 

Mrs. Henderson's mansion, perched precariously on a hill overlooking Savannah, was a testament to both grandeur and decay. The once-vibrant paint peeled like sunburnt skin, and the ornate gingerbread trim sagged under the weight of years. Finn knew every creak and groan of the place, having been called upon countless times to exorcise its electrical demons. But this time, something felt different. A prickling sensation on his neck told him he wasn't alone in the dusty attic, a feeling amplified by the unsettling silence that had descended, broken only by the tick-tock of an ancient clock somewhere downstairs.
