The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth. Dawn had barely cracked over the Cascade Mountains, casting long shadows from the towering redwoods that dominated Silas Blackwoodâ€™s world.  A chill wind whispered through the boughs, rustling leaves and carrying the distant murmur of chainsaws. Silas, his breath misting in the cool air, pulled his worn wool cap further down over his ears. The early hours were always the quietest, before the rest of the crew arrived and the symphony of industry began. 


He gripped the handle of his trusty axe, its familiar weight comforting in his calloused hand.  Silas had been logging these slopes since he was a boy, learning the ancient language of the trees from his father, then passing it down to his own son, now grown and working beside him. He knew every twist and turn of this forest, every gnarled root and whispering branch. Today, though, there was a tension in the air, a feeling that something was different, something...unnatural.  Silas couldn't shake the prickling sensation on the back of his neck, a warning whisper he hoped to ignore. But as he stepped into the dense undergrowth, the sound of the wind seemed to morph into a low, guttural growl, sending shivers down his spine. 


Something was coming. He just didn't know what.
