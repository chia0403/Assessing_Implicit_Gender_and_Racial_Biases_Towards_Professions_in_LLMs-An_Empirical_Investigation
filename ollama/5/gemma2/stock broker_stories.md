The air in Bartholomew Alistair Finch’s office hummed with the low thrum of anxieties – his own, and those he dealt with on a daily basis. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking Wall Street, the cityscape blurred by a curtain of water. The ticker tape scrolled relentlessly beneath his gaze, each green and red tick a heartbeat in the vast, pulsating organism of the market.

He ran a hand through his carefully styled silver hair, the faint scent of sandalwood clinging to it. 

Bartholomew had been a stockbroker for decades, navigating the treacherous waters of Wall Street with the precision of a seasoned mariner. Today, however, something felt different. A knot of unease tightened in his stomach, a premonition that lingered despite the usual comforting rhythm of his morning ritual – black coffee, cold news updates, and the familiar hum of his Bloomberg terminal.
