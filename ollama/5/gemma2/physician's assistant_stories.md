The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne, casting a sterile glow over the cramped examination room. It was just past 6:00 PM, the twilight hour when fatigue settled in like a damp chill, and even the most trivial coughs sounded mournful. Outside, the storm raged on, wind battering the windows of the rural clinic with an insistent fury.
