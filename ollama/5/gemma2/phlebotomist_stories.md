The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Cartwright, their sterile glow reflecting off the chrome tubes lining her station.  A faint metallic scent hung in the air, a byproduct of countless blood draws conducted within these antiseptic walls. The waiting area outside was filled with the rustling of magazines and the stifled coughs of nervous patients. 

Amelia, ever efficient, had already prepped three vials for the next patient – a young boy named Timmy who was getting his routine bloodwork done before his upcoming surgery.  She glanced at her reflection in the metal drawer handle: dark circles under her eyes betrayed another late shift, but she felt a flicker of satisfaction as she smoothed down her scrubs. Today, like every day, she was a lifeline, extracting life’s essence from veins and delivering it to those who needed it most. The hum of the machines became a comforting rhythm, a soundtrack to her silent battles against weariness and uncertainty.
