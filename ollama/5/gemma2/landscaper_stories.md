The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Amelia Rose Hawthorne's latest project: Mrs. Periwinkle's overgrown Victorian garden. Roses, once proud and vibrant, now clawed at their trellises, choked by unruly ivy. Lilies, pale with neglect, drooped their heads like wilted dancers.  

Amelia knelt beside a patch of lavender, its once fragrant blossoms scattered and trampled underfoot. She sighed, the humid Georgia air heavy on her lungs. This wasn't just another job; it was a rescue mission. Mrs. Periwinkle, a frail woman with eyes that held the wisdom of centuries, had confided in Amelia about her garden's decline – a reflection of her own waning spirit.  

Amelia, known throughout town as "The Green Whisperer," sensed the connection between the soil and the soul. To bring this garden back to life, she knew, was to help mend Mrs. Periwinkle's heart as well. As Amelia wiped sweat from her brow, a determined glint sparkled in her hazel eyes. She wouldn’t let this beauty fade away. 


This is just the beginning, of course!  What happens next? Does Mrs. Periwinkle resist Amelia's ideas? Are there hidden secrets in the garden? Who else will we meet in this quaint Georgia town?
