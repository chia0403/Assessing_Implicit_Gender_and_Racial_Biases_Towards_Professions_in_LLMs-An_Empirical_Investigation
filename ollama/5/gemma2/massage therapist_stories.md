The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that normally soothed Amelia Willowbrook's senses but tonight felt suffocating.  Rain lashed against the frosted windows of her small studio, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. She kneaded a knot in Mrs. Henderson's shoulder, trying to focus on the rhythmic pressure and gentle warmth she was known for, but each tense muscle seemed to scream back with the same discordant melody playing in her own head: **unease**.


Amelia's studio, nestled in a quiet corner of a bustling seaside town, was usually a sanctuary. Soft blues and greens adorned the walls, bamboo plants swayed gently in the corner, and calming music drifted from hidden speakers. But tonight, even the familiar sights and sounds felt disjointed, tinged with an unsettling undercurrent. The storm hadn't just brought rain; it had stirred something else, something lurking beneath the surface of Amelia's quiet life, threatening to pull her into its depths.
