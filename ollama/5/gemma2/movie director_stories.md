The air in Helena Blackwood’s office was thick with cigarette smoke and stale ambition. It clung to the faded velvet curtains, the cracked leather armchair she perched on, even the script pages scattered across her antique desk like fallen leaves. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her tiny West Hollywood bungalow, a discordant symphony echoing the tempest brewing within Helena herself. 

A mountain range of unreturned calls and unread emails loomed beside her computer, a testament to her dwindling reputation. "Helena Blackwood," they'd once whispered reverently, a rising star in a sea of mediocracy. Now, it was more like a sigh, a fading memory of what could have been. Her last film, a gothic romance riddled with miscasting and creative differences, had bombed harder than an asteroid on Hollywood Boulevard.

She ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, the frustration tightening its grip. 

Six months. Six months since she’d felt the electric thrill of creation, since she’d poured her heart and soul into something new. Six months since anyone, let alone someone with actual power, had taken her seriously.


But Helena wasn't one to surrender easily. Not when the story inside her head thrummed like a beating heart, desperate for release. 

She grabbed a pen, her gaze falling on a crumpled napkin beside her coffee mug. A scribbled outline, born in a moment of inspiration at a late-night diner.  A gritty noir thriller set against the backdrop of a decaying seaside town, populated with characters as complex and flawed as she was. 

Maybe this time, she thought, just maybe this time…
