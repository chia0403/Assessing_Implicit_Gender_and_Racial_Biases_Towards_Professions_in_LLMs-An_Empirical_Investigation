The air hung thick with the scent of lilies and beeswax polish in the grand foyer of Blackwood Manor. Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick, known to everyone as Ellie, hummed softly as she dusted the antique marble bust of Lord Blackwood, its once-gleaming surface now dulled by time and neglect.  Sunlight streamed through the stained glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the polished oak floor. Ellie’s worn cotton apron brushed against her knees with each meticulous movement. She paused, gazing up at the imposing portrait above the fireplace – Lord Blackwood himself, a stern-faced man in velvet breeches, his eyes seeming to follow her every move. 

Blackwood Manor had been Ellie's sole residence for the past fifteen years, ever since her parents passed away and she'd inherited this crumbling behemoth from her distant aunt.  The house was filled with whispers of its former glory – forgotten grandeur echoing in the cavernous halls, silent servants’ quarters, and dusty relics of a vanished era. Now, it existed in a state of suspended animation, inhabited only by Ellie and the occasional visiting relative who seemed more interested in the manor's scandalous history than its present inhabitants.  


Ellie straightened her back, ready to tackle the next chore on her ever-growing list. But as she reached for the feather duster, a faint scratching sound echoed from above. It wasn't the usual settling of old wood or the scurrying of mice. This was something new, something unsettling. Ellie paused, listening intently. The scratching came again, closer this time.
