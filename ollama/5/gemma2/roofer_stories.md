The wind whipped around Samuel Bartholomew “Sammy” Thatcher, tugging at his frayed baseball cap and sending shivers down his spine despite the July heat. He clung to the edge of the sloped roof, hammering in another shingle with gritted teeth.  

He squinted across the valley, where the sprawling city shimmered under a hazy sun. Buildings rose like steel and glass giants, casting long shadows that danced ominously across the patchwork quilt of rooftops below. Sammy’s current perch was on Mrs. Henderson’s Victorian home, perched precariously atop a steep hill overlooking the city. The view was spectacular, but today, the wind made him feel like a fly teetering on the edge of a whirlwind.

Sammy hated working in this weather. It made every movement precarious, every gust of wind a potential disaster. But Mrs. Henderson had insisted on getting her roof repaired before the impending storm hit, and Sammy, despite his reservations, couldn't disappoint her. He’d built up a reputation for being honest and reliable, and that mattered more than any fear of heights or fierce winds.
