The insistent chirping of sparrows outside her window was drowned out by the steady hum of the centrifuge in the corner.  Dr. Amelia Rose Brighton adjusted her glasses, peering at the viscous blood sample swirling within the glass tube. It was 8:30 am on a Tuesday, and already, the small town dental practice felt heavier than usual. The lingering scent of antiseptic hung thick in the air, punctuated by the faint aroma of burnt coffee from the ancient percolator brewing downstairs. 

Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples with a weary hand. Her receptionist, Doris, had called in sick, leaving Amelia to handle both patients and the phone calls â€“ a responsibility she'd taken on willingly, but one that was starting to wear thin.  The usual calm of the morning was replaced by an unsettling tension, like a storm brewing just outside the windowpanes. 


Outside, the quaint town of Oakhaven basked in the golden light of dawn. Its sleepy streets were lined with colorful Victorian houses and charming cafes, but Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
