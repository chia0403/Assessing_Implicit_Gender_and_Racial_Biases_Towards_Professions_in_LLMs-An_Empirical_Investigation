The grease clung to Elara "Ellie" Reyes' hands like a second skin. It was a familiar scent, comforting even, a testament to the countless engines she’d wrestled back to life under the flickering fluorescent lights of Reyes Auto Repair. The shop itself was a symphony of clanging metal, whirring gears, and Ellie’s own voice barking instructions at the misbehaving car in front of her: a dusty 1967 Chevy Impala with more personality than its owner.  

The afternoon sun slanted through the grime-coated windows, casting long shadows across the cluttered workspace. A symphony of tools hung on pegboards, their polished surfaces reflecting the amber light. Ellie's workbench was a battlefield littered with wrenches, sockets, and oily rags, all within reach for her nimble fingers. Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Ridge hummed with its usual languid rhythm, oblivious to the battle being waged within the confines of Reyes Auto Repair. 


Ellie wiped her brow, leaving a smear of grease across her forehead.  "Come on, you rusty beast," she muttered, giving the Impala's engine block a sharp tap. "Just tell me what you need.”
