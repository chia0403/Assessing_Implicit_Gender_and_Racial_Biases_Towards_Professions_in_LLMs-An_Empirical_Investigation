The damp morning air clung to Elias Thornwood like a second skin as he surveyed the sprawling Victorian estate. Crimson leaves, still stubbornly clinging to the ancient oak trees lining the gravel drive, crunched under his worn boots.  A thin mist, smelling faintly of decaying leaves and wet earth, hung low over the manicured lawns, obscuring the distant silhouette of the grand manor house. 

Elias took a deep breath, inhaling the crisp autumn air. The grounds were his domain, his responsibility â€“ a sprawling tapestry woven from meticulous hedges, vibrant flowerbeds, and winding paths that echoed with the whispers of past seasons. He knew every inch of this place, every crack in the pavement, every rustle in the undergrowth.  He was Elias Thornwood, Groundskeeper to Blackwood Manor, and he was alone. 


As a low rumble reverberated through the stillness, Elias glanced towards the manor house. The rumbling grew louder, accompanied by a sudden flash of light that illuminated the mist-shrouded lawn for a split second. He narrowed his eyes,  his gaze fixed on the now darkened windows of the mansion. Something was happening. Something out of the ordinary.
