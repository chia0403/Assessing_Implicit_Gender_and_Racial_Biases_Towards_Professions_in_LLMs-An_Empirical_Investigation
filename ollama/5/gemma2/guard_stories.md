The flickering oil lamps cast long shadows that danced across the cobblestones, making the guardsmen’s already imposing forms seem even larger and more menacing.  A biting wind whipped through the narrow alleyways of Duskhaven, carrying with it the stench of brine and rotting fish from the nearby harbor. Elara Nightsong shivered in her thick woolen cloak, its crimson lining barely visible beneath the layers of steel she wore. 

She adjusted the weight of her halberd on her shoulder, the leather straps chafing against her skin.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds that were quickly snatched away by the relentless wind.
