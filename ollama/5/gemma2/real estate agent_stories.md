The stale scent of potpourri mingled with the faint aroma of burnt coffee as Amelia "Amy" Blackwood adjusted the "For Sale" sign in the manicured lawn. A crisp autumn breeze ruffled the scarlet leaves clinging to the sprawling oak tree, casting dancing shadows across the front porch of the Victorian mansion. 

It was a picture-perfect scene, one that usually brought a warm sense of accomplishment to Amy's heart. But today, the weight of the past few weeks pressed down on her like the impending winter. The housing market had gone cold, and listings lingered longer than ever before. Even this sprawling beauty, with its ornate stained glass windows and hidden library tucked behind a bookshelf that swung open silently, seemed to be struggling to attract even the most discerning buyer. Amy sighed, feeling a familiar pang of doubt gnawing at her confidence.  

She straightened her blazer, trying to inject some optimism into her demeanor as she turned towards the house's gleaming brass door handle. This one was different, she told herself. There had been a palpable energy about it from the moment she first stepped inside, a sense that its past stories were waiting to be unearthed. And somewhere, beneath the layers of faded wallpaper and dust-covered antiques, there was someone out there who would feel the same pull. 


Amy took a deep breath and pushed open the door, ready to face whatever lay within.
