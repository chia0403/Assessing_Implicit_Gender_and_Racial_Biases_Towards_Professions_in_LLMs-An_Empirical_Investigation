Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest raging within her own mind. The late-afternoon light, filtered through the grimy glass, cast long, distorted shadows across her sparsely furnished waiting room. A lone armchair sat in the corner, its faded floral pattern barely visible beneath years of dust.  

Eleanor slumped back in her leather chair behind the desk, the worn surface cool against her palms. The day had been a relentless barrage of anxiety-ridden patients, each with their own unique brand of heartbreak and despair. She was running on empty, both emotionally and professionally. 

The insistent chime of the doorbell jolted her from her thoughts. A new patient.  Eleanor forced a smile, knowing she needed to compartmentalize her exhaustion and meet the unknown with her usual practiced empathy. This one, though, felt different. There was an unsettling energy radiating from beyond the door, a palpable sense of darkness that sent a shiver down her spine. 


The waiting room remained shrouded in shadows as Eleanor rose, preparing to face whatever lay beyond the threshold.
