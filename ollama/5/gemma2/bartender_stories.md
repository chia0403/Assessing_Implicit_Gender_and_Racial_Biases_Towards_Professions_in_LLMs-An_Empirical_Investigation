The neon sign outside The Drunken Poet flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked asphalt. Inside, the bar was just starting to hum with life, a Friday night symphony of clinking glasses, low chatter, and the occasional burst of laughter. 

Behind the polished mahogany counter, Elias Blackwood meticulously wiped down a beer stein, his movements practiced and precise. His dark hair was slicked back, revealing sharp cheekbones and eyes that held the weary wisdom of someone who'd seen it all â€“ or at least, most of what happened in this small, forgotten corner of Chicago.  He wasn't looking for adventure, just another night serving drinks and listening to stories, each one a tiny window into someone else's life.

The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival. Elias glanced up, his gaze lingering on the newcomer for a beat too long. Something about the woman's posture, the way she held herself with a mixture of confidence and vulnerability, sparked a flicker of curiosity within him. He couldn't quite place it, but he had a feeling this night wouldn't be just another ordinary Friday.
