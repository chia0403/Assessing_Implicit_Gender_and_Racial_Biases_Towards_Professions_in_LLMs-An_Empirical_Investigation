The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the worn linoleum floor of Mrs. Amelia Brightwood's office.  She sat perched on the edge of her slightly creaky swivel chair, flipping through a file labeled "Johnson, Daniel." Daniel, a sophomore with eyes that seemed permanently clouded by existential dread, was due any minute. 

Amelia adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses and sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her messy bun.  The walls of her office were plastered with inspirational posters – clichéd phrases like "Reach for the Stars" and "Believe in Yourself" felt hollow against the backdrop of Daniel's recent withdrawal from all extracurricular activities and his plummeting grades. 

Her small town, Maple Creek, was known for its quaint charm and close-knit community. But beneath the idyllic surface, anxieties simmered – teenage angst amplified by whispers about dwindling job opportunities and a struggling local economy.  Amelia felt it every day, like a low thrumming current running through the school hallways. She longed to offer more than platitudes and pep talks. She wanted to be a beacon of hope, but sometimes, even she felt lost in the darkness.
