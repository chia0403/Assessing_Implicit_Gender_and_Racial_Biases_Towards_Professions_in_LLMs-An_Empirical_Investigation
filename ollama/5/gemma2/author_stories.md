The flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across Amelia Everly's cluttered desk.  Dust motes danced in the warm light, illuminated like tiny stars against the backdrop of her overflowing bookshelf, crammed with well-worn paperbacks and ancient tomes bound in leather. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Victorian London echoed with the rumble of horse-drawn carriages and the distant chatter of hawkers peddling their wares. But inside Amelia's attic room, nestled above a bustling apothecary, there was only the scratching of her pen against parchment and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. 


Amelia, known for her atmospheric gothic novels that had captured the hearts (and nightmares) of readers across the city, sat hunched over her latest manuscript, a frown creasing her brow. This time, inspiration seemed to have abandoned her. The words wouldn't come, leaving behind a frustrating void on the page. She sighed, rubbing her tired eyes and glancing at the half-empty bottle of ink beside her. Perhaps a walk in the crisp autumn air would do her good.
