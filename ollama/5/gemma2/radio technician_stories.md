The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Elara Thorne like a second skin as she stepped out of her cramped workshop. The Arizona sun beat down mercilessly, turning the corrugated metal roof of her building into a searing hotplate. Sweat trickled down Elara's forehead, stinging her eyes. Even at this hour, just past sunrise, the desert shimmered with heat haze, blurring the distant mesas and cacti into hazy mirages.

It was cluttered with wires, spare parts, and dusty manuals, each one whispering secrets of bygone technology. Elara, known throughout Dustbowl as "The Fixer," possessed an uncanny ability to coax life back into even the most mangled gadgets. 

Today, however, her usual calm was shattered. A frantic radio transmission had pierced through the static, its garbled message a plea for help unlike any she'd heard before.
