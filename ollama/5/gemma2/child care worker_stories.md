The scent of stale Cheerios and hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air like a humid shroud.  Abigail “Abby” Hayes sighed, pushing back a stray strand of fiery red hair that had escaped its braid. The playroom at Sunnyside Daycare was a symphony of controlled chaos: toddlers shrieked with laughter as they chased each other around the miniature climbing gym, while preschoolers huddled on the floor, absorbed in a vibrant story about a princess who befriended a dragon. 

Abby loved this moment.  The sweet, chaotic energy that pulsed through the room like a live wire. It was why she chose to be a childcare worker, despite the low pay and constant battles with glitter and sticky fingers. This little universe of miniature humans, so full of wonder and boundless enthusiasm, filled her with a sense of purpose she'd never found elsewhere. 

But today, a tension hummed beneath the surface of the usual bustle.  Little Liam, usually the life of the party, sat slumped in the corner, his eyes fixed on a discarded building block. He hadn't spoken a word since he arrived this morning. Abby knew something was off, but his parents had simply said he was "having a bit of a day." But Abby suspected there was more to it than that. 


The sun slanted through the windows, casting long shadows across the playroom floor. It painted Liam's face in an eerie light, highlighting the worry etched beneath his normally cheerful features.  Abby crouched down beside him, her heart aching with a mixture of concern and helplessness. 

"Hey, Liam," she said softly, her voice barely audible above the din of the room. "Everything okay?"
