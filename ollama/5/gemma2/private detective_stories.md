The rain hammered against Silas Blackwood's office window like a thousand tiny fists, each blow a relentless accusation against the stillness inside.  He sat hunched over his desk, the dim glow of a single bulb casting long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered space. Papers, cigarette ash, and empty coffee cups formed a chaotic battlefield on the surface, testament to weeks spent chasing shadows and dead ends. 

Silas Blackwood wasn't born into this life, didn't dream of becoming a private detective in a city as grimy and unforgiving as Newhaven. He was a poet once, his words flowing like ink from a quill dipped in moonlight. But the city had a way of twisting dreams, turning them brittle and hollow. His poetry now lay abandoned in dusty notebooks, replaced by case files and half-smoked cigarettes.

A insistent rapping on the door shattered the silence, pulling Silas back from his thoughts.  He sighed, flicking a stray ash into the overflowing ashtray. The rain would keep pounding all night, just like the anxieties gnawing at him. He needed this case to break through, needed it to be something more than another dead end in the long, winding road of his life.


"Come in," he muttered, hoping for the kind of urgency that could jolt him out of his melancholic haze.
