The scent of hand sanitizer and crayons hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume for Emilia Rose Hawthorne, otherwise known as Ms. Rose to her pint-sized charges. Her classroom, nestled in the sunny corner of Oakhaven Elementary, was a kaleidoscope of color: crayon masterpieces adorning the walls, finger-painted rainbows splashed across easels, and alphabet blocks scattered like confetti on the floor. But today, amidst the usual chaos, a tension simmered beneath the surface. 

The morning had begun with an unusual quiet, replaced by an undercurrent of whispers as the children arrived. Even Timmy "Tornado" Thompson, usually a whirlwind of boundless energy, sat slumped in his chair, clutching his favorite stuffed dinosaur.  Ms. Rose glanced at the clock, its red digits mocking her with their relentless march forward. 

It was show-and-tell day. And something told Ms. Rose that this wasn't going to be just another presentation of plastic dinosaurs and worn-out teddy bears.
