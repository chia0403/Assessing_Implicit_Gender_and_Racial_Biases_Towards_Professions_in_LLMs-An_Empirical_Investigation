The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of Harold Percival's office. Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the stacks of manila folders piled precariously on his cluttered desk. A faint scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air. 

Harold, a man whose age seemed perpetually suspended somewhere between fifty and sixty, slumped back in his creaking swivel chair. His nametag – "Harold Percival, Insurance Solutions" – felt heavier than usual today.  He ran a hand through his thinning hair, sighing as he stared at the crumpled note on his desk. "Mr. Henderson's house fire… claims adjuster unavailable... need urgent assessment."

Another day, another disaster. Harold Percival wasn't just an insurance agent; he was a shepherd of misfortune, navigating the turbulent seas of life’s unexpected storms for weary clients like Mr. Henderson. 


The setting: A small, dusty office in a rundown strip mall on the outskirts of a forgotten town. The year is 1987.
