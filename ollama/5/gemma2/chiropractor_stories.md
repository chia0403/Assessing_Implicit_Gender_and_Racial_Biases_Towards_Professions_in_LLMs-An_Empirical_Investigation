The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of antiseptic and Dr. Elara Nightingale's ever-present cup of chamomile tea. Her office, tucked away on the third floor of a weathered Victorian building downtown, wasn't much to look at from the outside, but inside it was a haven of calming colours and soft textures. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window, casting kaleidoscopic patterns onto the worn oriental rug beneath Elara’s feet as she adjusted the vertebrae of Mrs. Peterson, her ninety-year-old patient. 

Mrs. Peterson, despite being confined to a wheelchair, had an unwavering optimism that always brightened Elara's day. "You young folks," she rasped, a smile crinkling the corners of her eyes, "have no idea how good you have it." Elara chuckled, gently releasing Mrs. Peterson’s spine.

The chime above the door tinkled, announcing a new arrival. Elara glanced up, curiosity piqued. The newcomer stood silhouetted in the doorway, tall and shrouded in shadow. He was carrying something bulky and wrapped in canvas – something that didn't belong in her tranquil space. A shiver ran down Elara’s spine, a strange premonition settling in her stomach. This wasn’t just another patient seeking relief from aches and pains. This visit felt different, charged with an unsettling energy that she couldn't quite decipher.
