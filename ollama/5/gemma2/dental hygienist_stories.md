The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of gleaming white chairs that lined the waiting area of Dr. Mallory's Dental Practice.  Amelia Josephine "Amy" Carter smoothed down her crisp blue scrubs, adjusting the tiny sunflower embroidered on the pocket. It was just another Tuesday morning, except today felt different. A prickle of anticipation buzzed beneath her skin, a feeling she hadn't experienced in years. 


Amy had been a dental hygienist for ten years, navigating the mundane routine with practiced efficiency. Scaling teeth and charting cavities had become second nature, but somewhere between the third molar extractions and the countless fluoride treatments, the spark had dimmed. Now, however, staring at the half-empty waiting area, Amy felt a flicker of that old fire. Perhaps it was the new sign hanging on the wall, "Embracing Smiles for Life," or maybe it was the way the morning sun streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Whatever the cause, Amy found herself eager to start the day.
