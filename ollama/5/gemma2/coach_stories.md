The humid Louisiana air hung heavy in the gym, thick with the scent of sweat and stale Gatorade. Outside, cicadas buzzed their incessant symphony, barely audible above the rhythmic thump of basketballs and the gruff commands echoing from Coach Amelia Dubois. Her brow furrowed as she watched her team, the Ruston Red Devils, execute drills. They were a ragtag bunch â€“ mismatched talents and personalities cobbled together under the oppressive summer sun.  

Amelia had inherited this mess after last year's coach bolted for greener pastures. She knew the Red Devils were far from contenders, but something in their tired eyes, the way they slumped onto the bleachers when drills ended, told her they craved a spark. Amelia, with her fiery red hair and relentless optimism, was determined to be that spark. 


She wasn't going to give them just another season of mediocrity. This year, under her watch, the Red Devils would fight.  They would sweat, they would learn, and they would leave everything on the court. But first, she needed to break through their apathy, ignite a fire in their hearts.
