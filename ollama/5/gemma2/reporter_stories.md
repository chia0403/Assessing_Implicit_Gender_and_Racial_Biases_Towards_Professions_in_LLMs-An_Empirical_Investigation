The air hung thick with humidity and the cloying scent of jasmine, clinging to Amelia Blackwood's hair as she navigated the labyrinthine alleys of Old Saigon. A mosaic of vibrant colours – silk sarongs draped over makeshift stalls, jade bangles glittering under the midday sun, crumbling walls adorned with peeling posters – swirled around her.  

Amelia, a reporter for the Saigon Times, wasn't here for the sights, though. She was on the hunt for a story, a whisper circulating in the back alleys about a hidden network smuggling rare artifacts from ancient temples. This rumour, passed down through whispered conversations and veiled threats, was Amelia's ticket to something bigger, something that could catapult her career beyond the mundane crime reports she usually covered. But Old Saigon held secrets close, and unearthing them often came at a price. 


As she pushed open the door of a tea shop, its interior dim with smoke and hushed voices, Amelia knew she was stepping into a world where truth was often more dangerous than fiction.
