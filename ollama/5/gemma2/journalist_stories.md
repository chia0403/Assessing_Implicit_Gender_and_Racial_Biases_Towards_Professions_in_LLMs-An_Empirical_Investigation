Rain hammered against the cracked windowpane of Amelia Josephine Carter's tiny office, each drop a miniature drumbeat echoing her own agitated pulse. The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows across her cluttered desk: stacks of yellowing news clippings, half-empty coffee mugs, and a single flickering candle providing the only light besides the sickly glow of her laptop screen. 

The air hung heavy with the smell of stale cigarette smoke and desperation – a potent combination Amelia had become intimately familiar with in her eight years as a journalist for The Bleak Herald, the last remaining independent newspaper in their dying, rust-belt town of Hollow Creek.  


She gripped her pen tighter, its worn plastic surface slick with sweat. The story she was trying to write felt impossible, like piecing together a shattered mirror from fragments that refused to fit. It was a story about whispers – rumors of a shadowy organization operating in the abandoned mines beneath Hollow Creek, rumors dismissed as paranoid ramblings by most. But Amelia knew there was truth buried beneath the surface, a truth too dangerous for anyone else to touch.
