The scent of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air as Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Cartwright adjusted her stethoscope. The worn vinyl of the chair beneath her creaked with every shift in weight, a familiar soundtrack to her mornings at Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the quiet room.  

Willow Creek was a haven for broken bodies and shattered spirits, a place where Ellie tried to rebuild both, one patient at a time. Today, she had a new case: a young woman named Sarah, who'd arrived after a devastating car accident, her dreams of a career as a dancer seemingly dashed. Ellie felt a pang of sympathy for Sarah, recognizing in her the same fierce determination that drove Ellie herself to help others find their way back from the brink. 


Ellie took a deep breath, smoothing down her crisp white coat. It was time to face another day, another chance to make a difference.
