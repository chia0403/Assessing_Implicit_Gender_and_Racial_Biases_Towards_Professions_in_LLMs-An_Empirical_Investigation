The fluorescent lights hummed above Eliza Blackwood's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows upon rows of meticulously labeled bottles lining the shelves. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and cough syrup, a familiar comfort in this place she'd called home for the past ten years. Her pharmacy, "Blackwood Apothecary," was nestled on a quiet street corner in the heart of Oakhaven, a small town where everyone knew your name and the gossip traveled faster than a speeding prescription refill.  It wasn't always glamorous, but Eliza found solace in the routine - dispensing medication, offering advice, and listening to the town's woes, big and small, over the counter. 

Today, however, something felt different. A tension hummed beneath the surface of the usual morning bustle. The sky outside was a bruised purple, mirroring the storm brewing in Eliza's gut.  She couldn't quite place it, but a sense of foreboding clung to her like the lingering smell of hand sanitizer.
