The scent of coconut shampoo and heated hairspray hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of stale coffee that clung to the corner where Beatrice "Bea" Josephine Albright usually perched with her mug. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes of "Curl Up & Dye," casting long shadows across Bea's station. Her usual array of colorful clips and bobby pins lay scattered on a tray beside a half-empty bottle of purple toner, evidence of her latest client's desire for "a touch of whimsy."  

Bea herself was a study in practicality. She wore a faded denim apron over a worn band t-shirt and her dark hair, usually pulled back in a loose bun, was escaping its confines in wispy strands around her face. Her gaze drifted to the clock - 9:45 am. The first clients of the day were due any minute, and Bea straightened her spine, steeling herself for another whirlwind morning at Curl Up & Dye, the only salon on Maple Street, nestled in a quiet corner of sleepy Havenwood, Oregon.
