The sleek glass walls of her office reflected the city’s shimmering expanse, a million tiny lights twinkling like fallen stars against the inky canvas of night.  Amelia "Amy" Sinclair Thorne adjusted the diamond stud earrings gifted to her by her late grandmother, a reminder of the legacy she carried on her shoulders. Her phone buzzed – another missed call from the head of marketing, demanding an update on the new campaign launch. Amy sighed, pushing away the mounting pressure like a tide retreating back into the sea. 

It was a Friday night, but for Amy Thorne, CEO of Thorne Industries, there was never truly a "weekend." The relentless hum of ambition vibrated within her, fueled by a thirst to build something monumental, something that would solidify her family's name among the giants of industry. Tonight, however, felt different. An unsettling unease coiled in her stomach, a whisper of discord amidst the usual symphony of ambition and success.  


**Setting:**

Amy’s office on the 50th floor of Thorne Industries headquarters, overlooking the sprawling metropolis at night. The modern, minimalist space is furnished with luxurious leather chairs, sleek mahogany desks, and panoramic windows that showcase the glittering cityscape.
