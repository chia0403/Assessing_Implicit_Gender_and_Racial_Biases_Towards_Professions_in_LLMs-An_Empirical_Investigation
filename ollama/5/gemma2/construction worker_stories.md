The steel beams groaned like tormented giants under the oppressive August sun. Sweat plastered Liam Callahan's worn t-shirt to his back, each bead a tiny testament to his grueling labor atop the skeletal structure of what would soon be the city's newest high-rise. He wiped his brow with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a streak of grime that mirrored the cityscape below – a patchwork of concrete and steel stretching towards the hazy horizon.  

Liam squinted at the shimmering heatwaves distorting the view, a familiar ache settling in his aging shoulders. This wasn't the life he had imagined for himself back when he was a kid, dreaming of being an architect. But sometimes, reality felt more like a sturdy foundation - solid, dependable, even if it lacked the soaring ambition of his youthful dreams.  

He glanced at the blueprints clutched in his calloused hand, tracing the intricate lines with a thumb thick from years of handling tools and rebar. This building was going to be something special, he could tell. It would stand tall, a symbol of progress against the ever-shifting skyline. But even as Liam felt a flicker of pride, the nagging worry tugged at him –  would it truly be better than the world it replaced? 


**Setting:** A bustling construction site in an unnamed, rapidly developing city during a sweltering summer day.
