The air in The Grand Magnolia was thick with the scent of jasmine and old money. Evelyn Beatrice Dubois, or Evie as she preferred, navigated the opulent lobby with practiced grace. Her polished shoes whispered against the Persian rug, each step carrying her closer to the grand staircase where Mrs. Worthington, the epitome of Upper East Side elegance, awaited her arrival.

Evie was a bell hop at The Grand Magnolia, a position that demanded an uncanny ability to blend into the gilded tapestry of the hotel's clientele. She knew every corner, every hidden nook, and every whisper that echoed through its halls. Her sharp eyes missed nothing, her smile never faltered, even when faced with demanding guests who mistook her uniform for an invitation to treat her like invisible air. 


She paused by a grand grandfather clock, its ornate pendulum swinging rhythmically, marking the passage of time in this world where minutes seemed to melt away into gilded hours. Evie glanced at the clock's face â€“ 2:47 PM.  Mrs. Worthington would be arriving soon. And with her, the promise of another day unfolding within the intricate web of secrets and desires that held The Grand Magnolia captive.
