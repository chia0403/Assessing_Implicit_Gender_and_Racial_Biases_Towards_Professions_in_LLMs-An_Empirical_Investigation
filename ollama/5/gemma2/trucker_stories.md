The sun, a bleeding wound on the horizon, cast long, skeletal shadows across the desolate Texas plains. Cletus Bartholomew “Big Cat” Callahan squinted through the grime on his windshield, navigating the familiar ribbon of asphalt that snaked through the heart of nowhere. His rig, a hulking Peterbilt named Betsy, rumbled and sighed beneath him, her diesel breath smelling of burnt oil and forgotten dreams. The air hung thick with the promise of rain, a metallic tang clinging to it like a shroud. Cletus had been hauling freight for twenty years, crisscrossing this vast, unforgiving landscape, each mile etched into his weathered face and calloused hands. Tonight, however, felt different. A low hum of unease vibrated beneath his skin, whispering of something unseen lurking in the shadows beyond the truck stop diner’s flickering neon sign. 


**Setting:**  A desolate stretch of highway in West Texas, late afternoon just before dusk.
