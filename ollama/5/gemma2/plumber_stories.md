The incessant drip-drip-drip echoed like a metronome keeping time with Elsie Mae Buttercup’s exasperation. It had started just after dawn, a subtle punctuation to her sleep-drenched morning. Now, it was an insistent tattoo against the silence of her Victorian bathroom, mocking her attempts at ignoring it.  

Elsie Mae Buttercup, sole proprietor of “Buttercup Plumbing: Fixing Your Leaky Dreams,” wasn’t one for dwelling on minor inconveniences. She had a whole house full of leaky dreams waiting to be fixed after all. But this insistent drip, originating from the ancient clawfoot tub, felt personal. It was a challenge, a test of her skills in a house she'd poured years and sweat into restoring.  

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Willow Creek, a quaint town nestled in the heart of Appalachia. Its charm lay in its meticulously preserved Victorian architecture, each house whispering stories of generations past. Elsie Mae’s own home was a testament to that charm, its gingerbread trim and wraparound porch a beacon against the twilight. But tonight, the leaky tub cast a shadow over the house's warmth, demanding her attention.  


The old pipes groaned under the pressure as Elsie Mae knelt beside the tub, flashlight illuminating the worn porcelain and faded floral wallpaper. This wasn’t just another leak; this was a mystery waiting to be solved.
