The scent of jasmine and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting cocoon against the relentless August heat of Savannah, Georgia.  Eloise Clementine Beauregard, or "Ellie" as everyone knew her, expertly maneuvered her curling iron, coaxing loose waves into Mrs. Davenport's thick, silver hair. Outside, cicadas buzzed their incessant symphony and the occasional dog barked a greeting from a shady porch. Inside Ellie’s salon, “Beauté Sud,”  a world of pastel hues, gleaming mirrors, and whispered secrets unfolded. 

Ellie hummed along to an old Ella Fitzgerald tune playing softly on the vintage radio in the corner, her eyes focused on her client's reflection. Mrs. Davenport, a woman who carried herself with the dignity of generations past, leaned back, a satisfied sigh escaping her lips. 


"Honey, you always know just what I need," she murmured, gently touching the newly coiffed waves. "This city wouldn’t be the same without your magic touch."
