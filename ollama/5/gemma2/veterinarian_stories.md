The smell of antiseptic and hay hung heavy in the air, mingling with Amelia Grace Hawthorne's freshly brewed coffee. Dawn was just breaking over the rolling hills of rural Vermont, casting long shadows across her weathered barn-turned-clinic. A rooster crowed in the distance, its call a familiar alarm clock for both man and beast alike. 

Amelia, affectionately known as "Dr. Amy" by the local farmers, ran a hand through her messy auburn curls, fatigue clinging to her like yesterday's dust.  She'd spent the better part of the night tending to Maggie, the prize-winning Hereford cow who'd taken a nasty tumble in the muddy field. Now, with Maggie happily munching on hay and the sun painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, Amelia turned her attention towards the day ahead. A steady stream of worried farmers and their ailing animals were sure to arrive soon, each one hoping for a miracle cure from "Dr. Amy" Hawthorne, the woman who loved animals more than anything else in the world.
