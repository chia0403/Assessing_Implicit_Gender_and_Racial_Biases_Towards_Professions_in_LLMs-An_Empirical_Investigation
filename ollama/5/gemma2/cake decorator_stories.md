The air hung thick with the scent of buttercream and impending deadlines. Amelia "Amy" Rosebud tugged at her toque, feeling the familiar weight settle over her brow like a comforting blanket. Her tiny bakery, "Sprinkles & Dreams," nestled in the cobblestone heart of Savannah's Historic District, buzzed with activity. Tourists snapped pictures of the pastel-colored facade and window displays showcasing Amy’s latest creations: towering wedding cakes adorned with delicate sugar flowers, whimsical cupcakes sculpted into miniature pirates, and an elaborate gingerbread house that would put Hansel and Gretel to shame.  

But amidst the sugary symphony, a storm brewed. A hurricane named "Hazel" was predicted to slam into the coast within 24 hours, threatening not only Amy's carefully crafted displays but also the livelihoods of everyone in her quaint town. As she kneaded fondant for an order due tomorrow morning, Amy stared out at the gathering darkness, her heart a tangled knot of anxiety and resignation. The hurricane might bring destruction, but it couldn’t touch the spirit of Savannah, a city that always rose above the storm, just like its legendary Spanish moss trees.
