The sun clawed its way over the horizon, casting long shadows across Amelia Rose Hawthorne's fields of golden wheat. Dew clung to her overalls, dampening her already calloused hands as she walked towards the farmhouse, the scent of freshly baked bread wafting from within.  The air was thick with the promise of another scorching summer day in Harmony Creek, a small farming community nestled deep in the heart of rural Montana. 

Amelia Rose, with her wind-swept auburn hair and eyes the color of rich, fertile soil, felt the familiar ache in her shoulders – a testament to a lifetime spent working the land. This year, though, the ache carried an extra weight. The drought had lingered longer than usual, parching the earth and threatening the livelihood she’d inherited from generations before.  The whispers of hardship were growing louder in Harmony Creek, and Amelia Rose knew she had to find a way to save her farm, even if it meant defying tradition.
