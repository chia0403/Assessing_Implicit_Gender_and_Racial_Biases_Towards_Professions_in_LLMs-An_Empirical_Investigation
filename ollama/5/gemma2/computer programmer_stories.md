The flickering neon sign outside cast an ethereal green glow across Elara Anya Sharma's face as she hunched over her keyboard. The faint hum of servers filled the tiny air-conditioned space behind the dusty "Cyber Cafe & Games" sign, a stark contrast to the humid Bangalore night pressing against the glass window.

Elara, or LARA as she preferred online, was a prodigy in the world of coding. She could sniff out bugs like a bloodhound and weave intricate algorithms with the grace of a concert pianist. Tonight, however, she wasn't chasing lines of code for profit. This project was personal â€“ a digital labyrinth designed to trap a ghost from her past, one that had haunted her dreams since childhood. 


The cafe was almost empty, save for a group of teenagers huddled over a console game in the corner.  Elara felt a familiar pang of loneliness as she glanced at their animated faces lit by the screen's blue light. She preferred the company of ones and zeros anyway. They were predictable, logical, and never judged her for the shadows that clung to her. 

Tonight, those shadows would be faced. Tonight, Elara Anya Sharma would finally confront the ghost in her machine.
