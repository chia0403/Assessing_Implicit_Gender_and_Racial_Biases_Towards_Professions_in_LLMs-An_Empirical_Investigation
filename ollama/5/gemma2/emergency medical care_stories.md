Rain slicked the asphalt, turning the street into a treacherous mirror reflecting the flashing red and blue lights of approaching sirens. Amelia "Amy" Grace Lawson, her brow furrowed in concentration as she sprinted towards the wreckage, fought against the urge to curse.

A plume of smoke rose from the engine compartment, adding an eerie halo to the scene. Amy could hear the frantic shouts of bystanders even before she reached the wreckage, their voices laced with fear and urgency.  She pushed past them, her EMT bag slung across her shoulder bouncing with every stride, her eyes immediately searching for any sign of life.
