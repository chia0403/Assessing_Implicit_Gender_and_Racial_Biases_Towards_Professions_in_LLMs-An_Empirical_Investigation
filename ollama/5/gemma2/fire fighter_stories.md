The siren’s wail was a familiar lullaby to Amelia Grace "Amy" Blackwood.  She'd known its sound since she was a little girl, growing up in the shadow of Station 12, her father a veteran firefighter with calloused hands and stories that crackled like flames themselves. Now, years later, she wasn’t just standing on the precipice of following in his footsteps; she was already running headlong into the inferno.  

The station itself, nestled between a bustling diner and a dusty antique shop on the edge of Pine Ridge, Oregon, was a symphony of chaos. Grease splattered from the griddle behind the diner wafted through the air alongside the scent of burnt coffee and stale cigarettes. A truck radio blared country music, a tinny counterpoint to the clanging of tools as Amy's team prepped for their next call.  The flickering neon sign outside the antique shop cast an eerie glow on the faces of her fellow firefighters, each one etched with a mixture of apprehension and grim determination. 

It was the smell of smoke that truly woke them up, though. A faint, acrid tang creeping through the open bay door, carried on the wind that whispered promises of rain. Amy felt the familiar surge of adrenaline, knew this call was different. It wasn't just another house fire; it was a gut feeling, a primal instinct screaming at her to move, to act.  The dispatcher’s voice crackled over the radio, confirming their suspicions: "Possible structure fire on Maple Street. Reports of heavy smoke." Amy reached for her helmet, her heart pounding in time with the siren's wail. It was time to face the flames.
