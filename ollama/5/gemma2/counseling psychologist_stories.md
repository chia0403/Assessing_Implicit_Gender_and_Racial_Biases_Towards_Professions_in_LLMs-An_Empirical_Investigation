The scent of rain clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s cashmere cardigan as she entered her office. Outside, Seattle was drowning in a typical April downpour, the grey sky reflecting the muted hues of the late afternoon light filtering through the frosted glass windows. Inside, the air hummed with the soft whirring of the humidifier and the gentle jazz emanating from the concealed speaker system, creating an atmosphere designed to soothe rather than stimulate.

Amelia Hawthorne, Dr. Rose Hawthorne to her patients, ran a hand over the worn leather of her desk, smoothing out imaginary wrinkles. It was just past four o'clock, the time slot reserved for Daniel, a young musician grappling with anxiety so profound it threatened to silence his music forever. She hoped today would be different.  This wasn’t the first time they had danced around the edges of his pain, but something in Daniel's voice on the phone earlier had hinted at a breakthrough, a flicker of light breaking through the storm clouds. 


Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever Daniel might bring. The rain outside seemed to whisper encouragement, a gentle reminder that even after the darkest storms, the sun always eventually returns.
