The stale scent of lemon disinfectant hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Thistlewick's threadbare uniform like a second skin. Her grimy rag danced across the polished floor of the grand old library, blurring the lines between dust bunnies and stray moonbeams filtering through the arched stained-glass windows. Outside, the city hummed with life, oblivious to the silent symphony of rustling pages and creaking floorboards that filled this cavernous space after hours. 

Amy knew every inch of this place â€“ the worn spines of forgotten classics, the whispering shelves holding tales both thrilling and tragic, the secret alcoves where sunlight dared to touch only for a fleeting moment.  She saw the library not just as a repository of knowledge, but as a living, breathing organism, each book a beating heart, pulsing with untold stories waiting to be unearthed. Tonight, however, a different kind of pulse thrummed through her familiar space - a disquiet, a tremor in the air that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.
