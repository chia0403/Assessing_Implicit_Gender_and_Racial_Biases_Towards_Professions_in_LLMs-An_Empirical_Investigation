The dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling like angry spirits in the relentless heat. The sun beat down on Juniper Creek Ranch, baking the weathered wood of the barn and turning the air thick and hazy. This was the heart of Arizona's summer, where even the cacti seemed to sag under the weight of the scorching days.

Amelia Rose Buchanan squinted out at the horizon, her brow furrowed beneath the brim of her dusty Stetson.  She could see the distant sway of tumbleweeds, a constant reminder of the harsh beauty of this land. At 32, Amelia was in her element here, as comfortable wrangling stubborn cattle as she was mending fences under a sky choked with stars. The ranch had been her family's legacy for generations, and she was determined to keep it alive, even if it meant battling drought, rising costs, and the ever-present threat of losing everything.  


Her calloused hand rested on the worn leather of the saddle horn as she looked out at her herd. They were a patchwork of dusty browns and greys, their heads low, searching for patches of green amongst the brittle grass. Amelia sighed. This drought was testing them all, pushing them to their limits.
