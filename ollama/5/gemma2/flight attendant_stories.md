The stale scent of recycled air and lukewarm coffee hung heavy in the cabin as Amelia Evelyn Harding meticulously straightened the tiny plastic tray tables. She hated this particular route - Seattle to Denver, always crammed with bleary-eyed business travelers clutching their laptops like life rafts. It was monotonous, predictable, a symphony of snoring and tapping keyboards punctuated by the occasional cry of a fussy toddler.  

Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Amelia's spine, an intuition she couldn’t shake. Maybe it was the man in seat 23A, his face shrouded in shadow beneath a wide-brimmed hat. Or perhaps it was the hushed whispers emanating from the back of the plane, conversations too low to decipher but thick with nervous energy. Whatever the reason, Amelia felt a knot tightening in her stomach. This flight, she knew instinctively, wasn’t going to be just another Tuesday afternoon journey across the Rockies.
