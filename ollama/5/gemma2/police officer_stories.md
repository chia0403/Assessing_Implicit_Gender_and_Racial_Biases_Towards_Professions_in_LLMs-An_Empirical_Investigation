Rain lashed against Detective Amelia Hawthorne's trench coat as she surveyed the scene. The neon glow of the "Lucky Clover" tavern spilled onto the slick cobblestones, casting an oily sheen across the puddles that mirrored the flickering lights like fragmented pools of despair.  Amelia pulled her collar tighter, trying to ward off the biting wind that whipped through the narrow alleyway where a lone figure lay crumpled against a dumpster. The smell of stale beer and wet asphalt mingled with something metallic and sickly sweet, making Amelia's stomach churn. This wasn't just another drunk passed out, this was a job.


Amelia Hawthorne, a woman who wore her sharp wit and even sharper gaze like armor, knelt beside the body, carefully avoiding the puddles that threatened to soak through her boots. The man, barely in his twenties, had dark hair plastered to his forehead, eyes staring blankly at the indifferent sky.  A thin trickle of blood stained the collar of his white shirt, a stark contrast against the vibrant red of the Lucky Clover's neon sign. 


Amelia knew this was just the beginning. The rain would wash away the evidence, the night would deepen its shadows, and secrets would rise like phantoms from the damp alleyway. She steeled herself for another long night in the belly of the city, where justice often felt as elusive as a dry patch on a rainy day.
