Here's a potential story opening:

---

The snowflakes danced outside the window of Karen Elaine Jensen's small office, casting a serene silence over the quiet suburban street of Oakwood Hills. Inside, Karen hunched over her computer, sipping lukewarm coffee and staring at lines of tax code on her screen. She rubbed her tired eyes, trying to shake off the lingering fatigue from another long day of dealing with audits and deductions.

As an income tax preparer for the past ten years, Karen had seen it all - the happy couples celebrating their refunds, the frazzled singles struggling to itemize, and even the occasional eccentric claiming a legitimate expense for their cat's dental care. But on days like this, when the drizzle of rain outside seemed to match the grayness in her own chest, Karen couldn't help but wonder if she was making a difference at all.

Just as she was about to give up on finding any solace in the numbers, her phone rang, shrill and insistent. "Jensen's Tax Prep," she read aloud, before picking up the receiver with a sigh. Maybe today wouldn't be so bad after all.
