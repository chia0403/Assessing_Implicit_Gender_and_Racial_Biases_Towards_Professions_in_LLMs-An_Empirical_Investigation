Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Portland were always at their most unforgiving in April, when the chill of winter still lingered beneath the surface of spring's promise. Occupational therapist Emilia Greyson stood under the awning of her clinic, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee as she gazed out into the grey mist that clung to the sidewalks like a damp shroud.

Inside, the waiting room was filled with the soft hum of nervous chatter and the muted beeps of anxious children's toys. Emilia's eyes scanned the crowded space with practiced detachment, her mind already tuning in to the complex web of motor skills, sensory sensitivities, and emotional regulation that would soon require her attention.

As a therapist specializing in working with children with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders, Emilia had seen it all before – the triumphs, the setbacks, and everything in between. But on this particular drizzly morning, something about the atmosphere felt off-kilter. Maybe it was the way the light filtering through the rain-soaked windows seemed to vibrate with an otherworldly intensity, or perhaps it was simply her own exhaustion playing tricks on her senses.

Whatever the cause, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that today would be different. Today, something – or someone – would challenge everything she thought she knew about herself and her craft.

How's this? I've introduced Emilia Greyson as a occupational therapist working with children with autism and other neurodevelopmental disorders. The setting is a rainy Portland clinic on a typical April morning. Let me know if you have any requests or changes!
