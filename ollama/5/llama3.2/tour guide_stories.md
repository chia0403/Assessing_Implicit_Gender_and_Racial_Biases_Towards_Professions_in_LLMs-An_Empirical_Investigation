Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. The sound of camel bells echoed through the air as tourists made their way towards the iconic Treasury Building, its facade glinting in the fading light.

Aurora "Rory" Wynter, a seasoned tour guide with a deep knowledge of Petra's history and secrets, stood at the edge of the crowd, surveying her group of guests. She had been leading tours through this ancient city for over a decade, but tonight felt different. Maybe it was the full moon rising high in the night sky, or the sense that she was being watched by unseen eyes.

As the group began to move forward, Rory fell into step beside her most enthusiastic tourist, a young woman named Sophia, who had been traveling solo through Jordan for weeks. "So, Rory, what's the story behind the Treasury?" Sophia asked, her eyes shining with excitement.

Rory smiled, launching into her well-rehearsed tale of how this magnificent building had once served as a royal palace and temple, its facade carved into the sandstone rock face by Nabataean artisans centuries ago. But as she spoke, Rory couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to Petra than met the eye â€“ and that tonight might just be the night she uncovered a secret that had been hidden for centuries.

How's this? I'd love to hear if you have any suggestions or changes!
