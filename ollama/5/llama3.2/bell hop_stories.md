Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans were always at their most unforgiving in April, when the city's mild winters gave way to sweltering summers that seemed to stretch on forever. Amidst the vibrant jazz clubs and ornate mansions, 22-year-old Antoine "Toni" Thibodeaux trudged through the downpour, his bell hop uniform clinging to his frame as he lugged a battered suitcase up the walkway of the historic Crescent Hotel.

As he pushed open the heavy wooden door and slipped into the warm, golden light within, Toni felt a fleeting sense of relief wash over him. It was a feeling that usually eluded him, given the meager pay and endless hours of physical labor that came with being a bell hop at one of New Orleans' most luxurious hotels. But there was something about this particular night that seemed different - perhaps it was the way the rain drummed against the roof above, or the flickering candlelight that danced across the walls like a hypnotic spell.

Whatever it was, Toni felt an inexplicable sense of hope as he made his way to the lobby desk, where his coworker, Rachel, looked up from her phone with a warm smile. "Hey, cher," she said, using the endearment that was so much a part of New Orleans' culture. "You're just in time for the evening shift. Our guests are starting to arrive."

As Toni clocked in and began to put away his suitcase, he couldn't shake the feeling that this night would be one to remember - for better or for worse.
