Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain poured down on the small town of Ravenswood like a dirty blanket, shrouding its crumbling Victorian homes and worn streets in a misty gray gloom. Inside his cramped but cozy plumbing shop, Jack Patrick McGowan huddled over a tangled mess of pipes, sweat-drenched and muttering to himself as he tried to coax the stubborn clog loose.

It was a typical Wednesday afternoon at McGowan's Plumbing, with only a handful of customers scattered about the shop - a gruff old man tinkering with his washing machine in the back, a young couple arguing over whose fault it was that their shower wouldn't turn on. Jack's phone rang, shrill and insistent, and he groaned, knowing it was probably just another emergency call from one of the town's older residents.

As he picked up the receiver, he gazed out the grimy window at the rain-soaked streets beyond. It was days like this that made him wonder why anyone would want to leave Ravenswood - but then, as he listened to the plaintive voice on the other end of the line, he knew exactly where he wanted to be.
