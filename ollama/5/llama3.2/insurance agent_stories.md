Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Orleans glistened like polished onyx as Reginald "Reg" Laurent III stepped out of his office building, a haze of cigarette smoke curling from the corner of his lips. It was a chilly autumn evening in 2015, and the city's vibrant jazz scene had been replaced by the melancholy wail of sirens echoing through the misty air.

As an insurance agent with over a decade of experience under his belt, Reg had seen it all - the devastating floods, the crippling hurricanes, the relentless lawsuits. But tonight felt different. Tonight, something was off.

Reg's eyes scanned the sidewalk, taking in the familiar sights and sounds of the French Quarter: the street performers juggling fire, the vendors hawking their wares, and the passersby hurrying to escape the chill. His gaze lingered on a small, rundown bar across the street, its neon sign flickering like a tired heartbeat.

Reg had been invited to a meeting at that very bar by his old friend, Jean-Pierre "JP" Boudreaux, a wealthy businessman with connections to the city's most powerful families. The note JP had sent him read: "Meet me at Pat's Tavern. Come alone."

Something about those words sent a shiver down Reg's spine. What did JP want? And why was it so urgent that he needed to keep their meeting private?

With a deep breath, Reg lit another cigarette and began his walk towards the bar, ready to face whatever lay ahead in the city he had called home for most of his life.
