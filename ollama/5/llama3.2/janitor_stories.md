Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights above the water cooler flickered like tired eyes, casting an eerie glow over the drab office cubicles of Smith & Co., Inc. The scent of stale coffee and yesterday's donuts wafted through the air, mingling with the faint tang of disinfectant as Janitor Edwin P. Bottomsworth made his way down the narrow aisle, his worn sneakers squeaking in protest on the tile floor.

Edwin had worked at Smith & Co. for five years, cleaning up after the suits and corporate climbers who spent their days huddled over spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations. He knew every nook and cranny of the office, from the clogged air vents to the secret stashes of sugar packets in the supply closet. But despite his familiarity with the space, Edwin felt like an outsider – a quiet, unassuming presence in a world that seemed to value loudmouthed ambition over quiet dedication.

As he pushed his cart through the deserted hallways, Edwin's thoughts turned to the morning ahead: a meeting with the facilities manager to discuss the state of the building's HVAC system, and a rumor circulating among the janitorial staff about a mysterious, unmarked package that was supposed to arrive at 3 PM sharp. Edwin wasn't sure what to make of it – but he had a feeling that today would be different in some way.
