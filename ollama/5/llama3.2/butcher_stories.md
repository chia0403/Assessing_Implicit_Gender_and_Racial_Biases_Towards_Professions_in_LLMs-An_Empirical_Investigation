The fog rolled in off the river, shrouding the streets of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a cold, wet blanket. In the small town's only butcher shop, nestled between a vintage clothing store and a bakery, Emilia "Mia" Thompson wiped down the counter with a dirty rag, her eyes scanning the rows of freshly killed meats on display.
