Here's a story opening:

As she locked up the salon for the day, Emilia Rose Thompson couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The sun had set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. But amidst the peaceful evening atmosphere, Emilia's mind was racing with worries.

The local beauty pageant was just around the corner, and Emilia was in charge of styling the contestants' hair for the big night. She had spent hours perfecting her craft, trying out new techniques and products to give each of them a winning look. But as she walked down the sidewalk, her eyes scanned the crowds of people gathered at the town square, and her heart sank.

There was a sense of unease in the air that Emilia couldn't quite put her finger on. It was as if everyone was waiting for something to happen, but no one knew what. The sound of distant laughter and music seemed to be carrying on the breeze, but it was laced with an undercurrent of tension.

Emilia quickened her pace, glancing over her shoulder at the old, dilapidated building that loomed behind the town square. It was a place that few people dared to venture into, especially at night. But as she walked past its crumbling facade, Emilia felt a shiver run down her spine.

She pushed open the door to her salon, shaking off the feeling of unease. She had a job to do tomorrow, and she couldn't let fear get the best of her. But as she turned to switch off the lights, she caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror.

For a moment, Emilia's reflection seemed to stare back at her with eyes that weren't quite her own. And then, just as quickly, the image vanished, leaving Emilia wondering if she had really seen something at all.
