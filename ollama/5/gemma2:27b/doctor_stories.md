Rain lashed against the warped glass of the dispensary window, blurring the already fading light of dusk. Dr. Elias Thorne adjusted his spectacles, the thin metal frame digging into the bridge of his nose as he peered at the prescription in his hand. It was for laudanum, an alarmingly high dose, and the name scrawled on the slip sent a shiver down his spine: Silas Blackwood.

Elias lived in Havenwood, a once-thriving port town now slowly succumbing to the damp grip of decay. The docks were mostly deserted, the ships long gone, replaced by rickety fishing boats that struggled against the relentless tide. Illness was rife, fueled by poverty and despair, making Elias's small dispensary a beacon of hope in the dreary landscape. Yet Silas Blackwood was no ordinary patient. He was a recluse who lived on the edge of town, in a crumbling mansion shrouded by overgrown ivy and whispered rumors.

Elias hesitated, the weight of the prescription heavy in his hand. What ailment could possibly warrant such a powerful dose? And why did the name Blackwood send a tremor through him? It felt like more than just morbid curiosity; it was an echo of something forgotten, a thread from his past tugging at the edges of his memory.
