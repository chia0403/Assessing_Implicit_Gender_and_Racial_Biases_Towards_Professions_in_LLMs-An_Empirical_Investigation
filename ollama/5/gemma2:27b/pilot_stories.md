The sun beat down on the cracked tarmac of the remote airstrip, baking the smell of dust and jet fuel into the air. Amelia "Ace" Ramirez adjusted her aviator sunglasses, squinting at the shimmering horizon where the endless blue desert met the hazy purple peaks. Her Cessna 172 shuddered slightly in the heat, its single engine whining a tired tune. Ace ran a hand over the faded paintwork, feeling the familiar grooves and bumps like Braille beneath her fingertips. This old girl had seen better days, but she'd always gotten Ace where she needed to be. Today, that was deep into the heart of the Painted Desert, searching for something lost long ago.

Ace wasn't your typical cargo pilot; she specialized in the unusual, the forgotten, the whispered legends. Today's client, a wizened old prospector named Jebediah Crowe, had hired her to locate a rumored hidden canyon said to hold ancient artifacts â€“ relics of a civilization swallowed by the sands centuries ago. The only clue was a faded map clutched tight in Jebediah's gnarled hand, its markings cryptic and barely decipherable. Ace loved a good challenge, and the lure of untold history whispered promises of adventure that she couldn't resist.
