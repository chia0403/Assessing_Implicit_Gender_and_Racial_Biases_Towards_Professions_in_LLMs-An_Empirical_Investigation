Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evans' cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing in Evelyn Rose Hathaway's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the overflowing trays of charts and crumpled prescription pads scattered across her desk. A faint scent of antiseptic battled with the musty odor of old paperbacks lining the shelves.  Evelyn, or "Evie" as her colleagues fondly called her, chewed on her thumbnail, staring at the latest scan results for Mrs. Peterson. The diagnosis was grim: Stage IV pancreatic cancer.

She'd been a physician assistant for five years now, and while she'd seen her fair share of suffering, this case felt different. Mrs. Peterson wasn't just another patient; she was Evie's neighbour, the kind old lady who always offered freshly baked cookies and a warm smile. Now, that smile was replaced with a weary resignation, and the fear in her eyes mirrored Evie's own.
