Rain lashed against the kindergarten classroom windows, blurring the view of the playground into a watercolor smear of greens and browns. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth perched on the edge of her oversized, rainbow-colored reading rug, trying to muster enthusiasm for another round of "The Wheels on the Bus." Five pairs of wide eyes stared up at her, their expressions ranging from boredom to outright defiance.  

It was a Wednesday, which meant Music class followed by free play, usually a joyous explosion of glitter glue and building blocks. But today, the storm outside had seeped into the classroom, leaving a palpable air of melancholy. Even Bubbles, Eleanor's normally hyperactive guinea pig, huddled in the corner of his cage, refusing his afternoon carrot.  

Eleanor sighed. This wasn't how she envisioned her first year as a kindergarten teacher. She'd dreamt of sparking curiosity, nurturing imaginations, and spreading joy through finger paints and singalongs. Instead, she felt like she was battling a tide of tantrums and sticky fingerprints.
