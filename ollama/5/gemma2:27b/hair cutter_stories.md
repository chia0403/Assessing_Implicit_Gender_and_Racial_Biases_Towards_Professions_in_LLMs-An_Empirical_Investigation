Rain lashed against the windowpane of "Curl Up & Dye," blurring the neon sign into a hazy pink smudge. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne hummed along to Billie Eilish as she meticulously snipped at Mrs. Peabody's unruly curls, transforming them into a perfectly coiffed halo. The air was thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and hairspray, punctuated by the occasional sizzle from the straightening iron wielded by her apprentice, Toby.

Amelia paused, tilting her head as if listening to something only she could hear.  The rhythmic click-clack of the rain against the window seemed to shift tempo, a low thrumming vibration weaving its way into the background noise. A shiver danced down her spine. It wasn't just the chill from the drafty storefront; there was an unfamiliar energy in the air, a prickling sensation that sent goosebumps erupting on her arms.
