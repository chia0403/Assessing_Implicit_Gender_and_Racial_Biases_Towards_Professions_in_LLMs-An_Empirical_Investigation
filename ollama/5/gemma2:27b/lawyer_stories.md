The once prestigious Cartwright Law firm, founded by her grandfather, was teetering on the brink of collapse.

She traced the faded inscription on the old clock above the fireplace: "Time waits for no man." A bitter laugh escaped her lips. Time, it seemed, was running out for Eloise and her legacy.
