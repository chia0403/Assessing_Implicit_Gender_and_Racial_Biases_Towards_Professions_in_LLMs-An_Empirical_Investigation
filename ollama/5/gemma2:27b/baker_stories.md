The air in "Batter Up Bakery" hung thick with the scent of caramelized sugar and warm yeast. Sunlight streamed through the front window, illuminating dust motes dancing above trays laden with still-cooling croissants and glistening fruit tarts. Beatrice "Bea" Cartwright hummed along to the old jazz tune crackling from the vintage radio perched on a high shelf, her hands expertly kneading dough into a smooth, elastic ball. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh's Old Town bustled with morning activity, but inside Bea's haven, time seemed to slow down, measured only by the gentle rise of dough and the rhythmic clatter of mixing bowls.  

Today was different, though. A nervous flutter danced in Bea's stomach as she glanced at the clock. She had a meeting later that afternoon, one that could change everything for her beloved bakery.
