The pungent smell of acetone hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of strawberry polish.  It was a familiar cocktail to Esmeralda Diaz, owner and operator of "Esme's Enchanted Nails," tucked away on a quiet side street in Brooklyn. 

Outside, rain lashed against the shop window, blurring the neon sign that flickered intermittently. Inside, Esmeralda hummed along to a salsa song playing softly from her phone, meticulously shaping a client's acrylic nails into elegant almond shapes. Her hands, calloused but precise, moved with practiced ease. The woman in the chair, Mrs. Rodriguez, sighed contentedly, her eyes closed as Esmeralda buffed the nail surface to a glossy shine.

Suddenly, the bell above the door jangled, announcing a customer. Esmeralda glanced up, expecting to see a familiar face from the neighborhood. Instead, a stranger stood framed in the doorway, his tall figure obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and a trench coat that seemed to swallow him whole. A chill ran down Esmeralda's spine, despite the warmth radiating from the nail dryer. Something about this man feltâ€¦off.
