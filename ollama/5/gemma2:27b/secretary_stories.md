The insistent chirp of Amelia Winthrop's vintage Bakelite phone sliced through the afternoon quiet like a hot knife through butter.  She sighed, pushing aside the stack of invoices she was meticulously organizing and reaching for the receiver. The mahogany desk, polished to a gleam by generations of secretaries before her, hummed beneath her fingers.

Outside, the late October rain hammered against the stained-glass windows of Winthrop & Sons Shipping Company, blurring the intricate floral patterns into watercolor swirls.  Amelia peered out briefly, wishing she were tucked away in a cozy bookstore with a cup of steaming tea and a good mystery novel instead of facing another afternoon of deciphering Mr. Davenport's scrawled notes.

"Winthrop & Sons," Amelia answered, her voice as crisp and professional as the starched white collar of her blouse.  

The caller on the other end spoke quickly, his voice laced with an urgency that pricked Amelia's ears. It wasn't a routine inquiry about cargo schedules or shipping rates. This was something different, something intriguing. Something that promised to shatter the predictable rhythm of her workday and plunge her into a mystery far more thrilling than any she could find in a book.
