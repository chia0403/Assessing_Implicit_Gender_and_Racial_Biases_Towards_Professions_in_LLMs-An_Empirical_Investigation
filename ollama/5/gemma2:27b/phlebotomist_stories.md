Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of City General Hospital, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Elara Mae Ramirez's heart.  The waiting room buzzed with anxiety, a symphony of coughs and sniffles punctuated by the occasional sob. Elara, her navy scrubs damp from the humid night air, tried to focus on the task at hand: drawing blood from Mrs. O'Malley, whose face was pale and etched with worry lines deeper than the wrinkles on an ancient map.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile pallor over everything. The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang Elara associated with fear. She knew that for many patients, seeing her arrive meant confronting their own mortality, their anxieties amplified by the sharp prick of a needle. 


Elara had always been drawn to phlebotomy, finding a strange comfort in the act of drawing lifeblood, a silent observer of the body's hidden currents. Yet tonight, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.  A nameless dread gnawed at her, fueled by the storm raging outside and the unnerving stillness emanating from the usually boisterous ER.

"Ready when you are, Mrs. O'Malley," Elara said, her voice calm despite the tremor in her hands. As she prepped the needle, a chilling gust of wind rattled the windowpane, plunging the room into momentary darkness.
