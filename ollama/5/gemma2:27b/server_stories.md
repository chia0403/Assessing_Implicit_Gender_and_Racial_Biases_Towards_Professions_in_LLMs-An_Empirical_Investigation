The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and desperation.  Elara Mae Thompson expertly navigated the crowded dining room of "Mama Rosa's," her worn leather apron straining against the weight of overflowing plates. 

It was Friday night, which meant chaos. Families bickered over red-checkered tablecloths, businessmen barked into cell phones, and college kids giggled nervously on their first dates. Elara, with her sunshine-yellow hair pulled back in a tight braid and eyes that sparkled with weary amusement, treated them all the same - a smile for everyone, even the grumpy old man who always complained about his lukewarm coffee.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Mama Rosa herself wasn't in the kitchen, stirring her legendary marinara sauce. She was at home, battling a stubborn flu, leaving Elara in charge of the entire restaurant.
