Rain hammered against the greenhouse glass, a relentless rhythm that mirrored Alistair Fitzwilliam's churning stomach. He hunched his shoulders deeper into his patched tweed jacket, staring out at the storm lashing the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor. It was supposed to be a day for trimming roses and coaxing life back into the wilting hydrangeas, not bracing against a tempest that threatened to tear the fragile petals from their stems.

Blackwood Manor, with its ivy-choked stone walls and turrets reaching towards the bruised sky, had been Alistair's domain for fifteen years. He knew every gnarled branch of the ancient oak by the pond, every hidden nook where rabbits sheltered, every secret pathway threading through the overgrown gardens. But today, even this familiar haven felt hostile. The wind howled like a banshee, and lightning illuminated the storm clouds with an eerie, flickering light.

Alistair shivered, not from the cold, but from a deeper unease. Something felt amiss â€“ a disquiet he couldn't quite pin down. It started with the unsettling dreams that plagued him each night, visions of shadowy figures lurking in the darkened corridors of the manor. Then there were the whispers, faint and fleeting, carried on the wind, speaking of secrets buried beneath the soil.
