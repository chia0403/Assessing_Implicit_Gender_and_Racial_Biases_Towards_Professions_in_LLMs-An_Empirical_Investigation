The air in the atelier hung thick with the scent of lavender and singed silk. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path and catching on the intricate embroidery adorning a half-finished gown draped over a mannequin. Eloise Genevieve Beaumont, her brow furrowed in concentration, delicately traced the outline of a rosebud onto ivory satin, her needle flashing like quicksilver in the warm light.

Outside, the cobbled streets of Montmartre buzzed with life â€“ vendors hawking their wares, children chasing pigeons through the square, and the rhythmic clang of a nearby blacksmith's hammer. But inside Eloise's world, all was hushed save for the soft rustle of fabric and the gentle tap-tap-tap of her needle against the silk.  Eloise dreamed of escaping the confines of her tiny atelier, of seeing her creations gracing the grand ballrooms and opulent salons of Paris. 

But first, she had a deadline to meet. The Duchess de la Fontaine was expecting her wedding gown in three days, and Eloise wouldn't rest until every bead was perfectly placed, every seam flawlessly sewn.
