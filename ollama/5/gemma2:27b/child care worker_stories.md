Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the Cozy Corner Daycare, blurring the vibrant colors of the hand-painted murals into streaks of watercolor. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she listened to the symphony of sniffles and cries echoing from the nap room. It was always like this on dreary days; even the littlest ones seemed to sense the gloom outside, reflecting it in their own tiny storms of emotion.

She adored the sticky fingerprints, the endless questions about dinosaurs and princesses, and the pure joy radiating from a child who'd just mastered stacking blocks. But today, with the relentless rain pounding on the roof and a chorus of sniffles filling the air, she felt a pang of longing for something more, something beyond the colorful chaos of her daily routine.
