The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's shop was thick with the metallic tang of blood and the comforting scent of woodsmoke curling from the old cast iron stove in the corner. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Grimsborough were slick with rain, reflecting the gaslight glow in a distorted shimmer. Bart wiped his brow with a sleeve stained crimson, a grim smile playing on his lips as he surveyed the day's work. Two haunches of venison hung from hooks, glistening ruby red under the butcher shop's single lantern. A fresh side of pork lay neatly wrapped on the counter, ready for Mrs. Hathaway's Sunday roast. 

But today felt different. A chill clung to the air, deeper than the autumn drizzle could explain. Bart shivered, not from cold, but from a nameless unease that settled like lead in his gut. He glanced towards the back door, bolted tight against the howling wind, and couldn't shake the feeling that something wicked this way came.
