Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, mimicking the frantic drumming in Elara Ainsworth’s chest.  The storm had rolled in unexpectedly, shrouding the ancient oak trees that lined Elmwood Street in an ominous gloom.  Normally, the rhythmic patter of rain on the library roof was a comforting sound, but tonight it felt like a prelude to something sinister.

Elara straightened her spectacles, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her bun.  She glanced at the towering shelves that stretched towards the vaulted ceiling, crammed with volumes spanning centuries and continents. The scent of aged paper and leather usually calmed her frayed nerves, but tonight even the familiar aroma couldn't soothe the unsettling feeling that gnawed at her insides.

It had started subtly – a misplaced book here, a whispered voice there.  But now, things were escalating. A shadow flickered in the periphery of her vision, disappearing when she turned to face it. Pages rustled in empty aisles. And then there was the inscription she'd found etched into the spine of an ancient grimoire: "When the raven cries thrice, darkness shall descend."
