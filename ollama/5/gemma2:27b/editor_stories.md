Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia Blackwood's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. The incessant drumming mirrored the anxiety thrumming in her chest. A stack of manuscripts towered precariously on her desk, each one a potential lifeline or a final nail in the coffin of Blackwood & Sons Publishing House.

Amelia ran a hand through her salt-and-pepper hair, the weight of generations settling onto her shoulders.  Her grandfather had started the press with nothing but a dream and a battered typewriter. Her father had nurtured it into a respectable literary house. But the digital age was proving ruthless, swallowing smaller publishers whole like ravenous beasts.

Tonight, Amelia faced a crucial decision. One manuscript promised a commercial slam dunk, a gritty thriller guaranteed to fly off shelves. The other, a lyrical coming-of-age story set in the Scottish Highlands, tugged at her heartstrings but held little commercial promise.  Choosing one meant abandoning the other, a choice that could make or break Blackwood & Sons.
