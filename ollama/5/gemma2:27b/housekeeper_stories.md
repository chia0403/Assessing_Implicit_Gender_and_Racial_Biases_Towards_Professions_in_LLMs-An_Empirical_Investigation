Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Blackwood Manor, each gust rattling the ancient panes like skeletal fingers clawing for entry. Eleanor Ainsworth, her silver braid bouncing with every determined stride, wrestled a heavy laundry basket up the grand oak staircase. The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and beeswax, overlaid with the faint, cloying sweetness of decay that seemed to permeate the very stones of the house. 

Blackwood Manor had been Eleanor's domain for nearly twenty years.  She knew every creaking floorboard, every dusty portrait staring down from its gilded frame, every secret nook and cranny where cobwebs gathered like ghostly lace. It was a job she'd taken on with desperation after her husband's untimely demise, a job that had become more than just a paycheck â€“ it was an anchor in a sea of grief. 

But tonight, the manor felt different. The wind seemed to whisper warnings through the eaves, and the shadows danced with an unnatural energy. Even the usually stoic gargoyles perched on the roofline appeared to be leering down at her with malevolent glee. As Eleanor reached the landing, she paused, a shiver tracing its way down her spine. Something was amiss.
