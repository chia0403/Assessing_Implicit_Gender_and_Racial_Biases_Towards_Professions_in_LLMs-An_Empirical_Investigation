Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside him. The antique grandfather clock in the corner ticked with an unsettling rhythm, each chime a hammer blow to his already frayed nerves. Outside, the city of Bellhaven, usually bustling with life, was cloaked in an oppressive grey silence.

Elias, a man whose salt-and-pepper hair and kind eyes belied a mind constantly grappling with the complexities of human emotion, stared at the empty chair across from him. It had been vacant for the past hour â€“ a testament to the cancellation Elias received mere minutes before his scheduled session. He understood, of course. Bellhaven was reeling from the disappearance of a local artist, Sarah Evans, vanished without a trace three days prior. Fear and anxiety hung heavy in the air, making even the most routine appointments feel fraught with uncertainty. 


Elias sighed, pushing aside the stack of journals he'd been reviewing. He needed to ground himself, find a way to navigate this unsettling tide. But how do you help others when the world itself feels on the brink of collapse?
