Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of "Petal & Plume," blurring the vibrant hues of the dahlias Amelia Winthrop had meticulously arranged that morning. The scent of lilies and hyacinths mingled with the earthy aroma of damp soil, creating a comforting cocoon within the tiny shop. Amelia sighed, her breath fogging the cool glass. Usually, the dreary November weather brought a surge in customers seeking to brighten their homes with splashes of color. Today, however, only the wind seemed eager for company.

Amelia adjusted the worn apron over her floral-patterned dress and picked up a stray rose petal from the countertop, twirling it between her fingers.  She glanced at the clock ticking away on the wall â€“ almost closing time. A pang of disappointment tugged at her heart. She had been hoping to sell the last of the sunflowers, their golden heads drooping slightly under the weight of unsold dreams.

Suddenly, a gust of wind slammed open the shop door, sending a swirl of rain and leaves skittering across the floor. Amelia startled, looking up to see a figure silhouetted against the dim light.  A man, tall and cloaked in shadows, stood dripping on her doorstep.
