Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office, blurring the view of the already dreary playground beyond. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the colorful posters lining the walls: "Kindness Matters," "You Are Enough," and a cheery cartoon sun proclaiming "Every Day is a Fresh Start."  Eleanor, however, didn't feel particularly sunny. She stared at the file in her hand, the name "Ethan Miller" scrawled across it in bold black ink. Ethan was a new student at Oakhaven Elementary, recently transferred from another district after a series of…incidents. 

The reports Eleanor had received were vague, citing “behavioral challenges” and “difficulty adjusting to new environments.”  But something about them felt off, like a puzzle missing crucial pieces.  Eleanor took a deep breath, pushing away the unease that gnawed at her. It was time to meet Ethan Miller and see for herself what lay beneath the surface.
