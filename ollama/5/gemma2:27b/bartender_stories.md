The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow over the rain-slicked alleyway. Inside "The Rusty Nail," the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of stale beer.  Behind the mahogany bar, Elias Thorne meticulously polished a glass, his movements practiced and precise. Each swipe of the rag was a counterpoint to the cacophony surrounding him: drunken laughter, slurred confessions, the mournful wail of a blues guitar from the corner jukebox.

Elias wasn't one for idle chatter. He preferred listening â€“ absorbing the stories spilled across the bar like spilled whiskey, each one a fleeting glimpse into another life. Tonight, however, something felt different. A palpable tension thrummed beneath the surface of the usual revelry, as if a storm was brewing beyond the grime-streaked windows.  A shiver ran down Elias's spine, and he instinctively tightened his grip on the glass. 


He knew this city, knew its underbelly like the back of his hand. And tonight, something whispered that trouble was about to walk through that door.
