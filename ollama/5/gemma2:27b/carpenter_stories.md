The smell of sawdust and pine hung heavy in Elias Thorne's workshop, a comforting aroma that had been his constant companion for over forty years. Sunlight, filtered through grimy windows, illuminated motes dancing above the worn wooden workbench where he stood. Elias, with his calloused hands and greying beard flecked with wood shavings, surveyed the half-finished rocking horse before him. Its mane was carved from a single piece of oak, impossibly flowing and lifelike. He ran a rough finger over the smooth surface, feeling the grain beneath his fingertips. 

Today was different, though. The familiar rhythm of his work felt off-kilter, punctuated by a gnawing unease that settled in the pit of his stomach. He glanced at the window overlooking the cobblestone street below, where villagers bustled about their day. Something was amiss. A hushed tension hung in the air, thicker than the sawdust itself.  

Elias knew it had something to do with the whispers he'd overheard in the tavern the previous night â€“ whispers of a darkness creeping towards their valley, a shadow that threatened their peaceful existence. He shook his head, trying to dismiss the unease. Surely it was just old wives' tales, figments of imagination fueled by ale and fear.  But deep down, Elias couldn't shake the feeling that something truly sinister was brewing.
