The incessant ping of the elevator announced another arrival, jolting Elara Finch back to reality. She pasted on her practiced smile, smoothed down her perpetually-creased uniform skirt, and braced herself for whatever walk-in fate had in store. The Grand Blackwood Hotel, with its gleaming marble floors and ostentatious chandeliers, prided itself on impeccable service. Which meant Elara, the unassuming receptionist with a penchant for forgotten poetry and chipped teacups, was expected to embody grace under pressure, even when faced with demanding socialites or bewildered tourists.

Today, however, felt different. A restless energy thrummed beneath her skin, an unsettling premonition that something unusual was about to unfold. The air hung heavy with the scent of lilies and old money, but beneath it lurked a faint tang of ozone, like the air before a thunderstorm. Elara glanced at the antique grandfather clock in the corner - 3:17 pm precisely. Time seemed to stretch, every tick an amplified drumbeat against the backdrop of hushed conversations and clinking champagne flutes.
