The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby hung heavy with the scent of lilies and regret. Bartholomew "Bart" Quincy Higgins III adjusted his crisp bellhop uniform, the brass buttons glinting under the ornate chandelier. Dust motes danced in the golden light, swirling like miniature tornadoes. Bart sighed, watching a gaggle of socialites, dripping in diamonds and disdain, glide past him towards the opulent ballroom. Another night, another parade of wealth and unhappiness.

The Grand Blackwood was a relic of a bygone era, its marble floors and gilded moldings whispering tales of faded grandeur. But beneath the shimmering surface lurked shadows â€“ hushed whispers of lost fortunes, broken promises, and secrets buried deep within its walls. Bart had seen it all, from tearful farewells to clandestine rendezvous. He knew every creak of the floorboards, every echo in the echoing hallways, like a familiar lullaby.

Tonight, however, felt different. An unsettling tension thrummed through the air, as palpable as the humidity clinging to his starched collar. Bart sensed a storm brewing, something beyond the usual drama that unfolded within these gilded walls. He just didn't know what it was, yet.
