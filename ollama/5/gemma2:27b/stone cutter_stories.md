The relentless Tuscan sun beat down on Elio Visconti's back, turning his linen shirt damp with sweat. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh light filtering through gaps in the worn wooden roof above his workstation. Around him, the cavernous workshop hummed with activity. Hammers clanged against chisels, saws rasped rhythmically, and the rhythmic thud of mallets echoed off the rough-hewn stone walls. Elio, however, worked in a focused silence, his weathered hands guiding his chisel with an almost intuitive precision. He was shaping a delicate marble angel, its wings poised for flight, its serene face reflecting the timeless beauty he sought to capture from the raw stone.

His workshop, nestled in the heart of Florence's Oltrarno district, was a testament to generations of Visconti stonemasons. The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and linseed oil, mingled with the faint aroma of woodsmoke from the forge next door. Tools of every imaginable size and shape lined the walls - mallets worn smooth with use, chisels gleaming sharp, templates for sacred geometries, and rough sketches of unfinished commissions. Elio, his brow furrowed in concentration, was oblivious to the bustle around him. He saw only the angel taking form beneath his touch, its ethereal grace slowly emerging from the cold, unforgiving marble.
