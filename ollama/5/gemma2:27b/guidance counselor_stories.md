Rain hammered against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the drum solo her heart seemed intent on playing. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an unsettling green hue over the worn posters plastered across the walls: "Dream Big," "Your Future Starts Now," "Believe in Yourself." Irony, Eleanor thought bitterly.

Her office at Northwood High School was anything but a haven of hope and ambition. It smelled faintly of stale coffee and teenage angst, with crumpled tissues peeking from overflowing wastebaskets and a trail of candy wrappers leading to the door. 

The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly towards 3:00 pm, dismissal time. Eleanor knew that meant another wave of stressed-out seniors desperate for last-minute college applications help, their faces etched with anxiety and entitlement in equal measure.  She sighed, rubbing her temples. Today was already shaping up to be one of those days where even a triple espresso wouldn't be enough.
