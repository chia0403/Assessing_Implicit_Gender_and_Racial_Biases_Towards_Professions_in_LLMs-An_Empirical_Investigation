The chrome grille of Big Rig Betty reflected the dying embers of sunset in a fiery dance. Behind the wheel, Silas "Ironhand" Jackson squinted at the horizon, his calloused fingers tightening on the worn leather. The endless tapestry of Nevada desert stretched before him, punctuated by distant mesas casting long, skeletal shadows. A weary sigh escaped his lips, mingling with the faint scent of diesel and stale coffee that permeated the cab. He'd been hauling this load of copper ore from Arizona for three days straight, barely stopping except for fuel and bathroom breaks. 

Silas was a man of few words and even fewer smiles. His weathered face bore the map of a life spent on the road – deep furrows carved by sun and wind, eyes that held the wisdom of countless miles traversed. The nickname "Ironhand" wasn't just a moniker; it spoke to his legendary grip on the wheel and his unwavering determination in the face of any obstacle. He was a solitary figure, content with the hum of the engine and the endless expanse of asphalt as his companions.

But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced at the nape of his neck, a nameless unease settling in the pit of his stomach. The desert wind seemed to whisper warnings, carrying the scent of dust and something else…something metallic and unsettling.
