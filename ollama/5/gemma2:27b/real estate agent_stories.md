Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Penelope "Penny" Davenport's beat-up Honda Civic, blurring the already dismal view of the abandoned textile mill looming ahead. Penny grimaced, tugging her threadbare scarf tighter around her neck. The stench of mildew and decay hit her before she even stepped out of the car. This place was a death trap waiting to happen, a far cry from the charming Victorian homes she usually peddled in the historic district.

But desperation had a way of stripping away pretenses. Penny needed this sale, bad. Three months without a decent commission and her landlord's threats were starting to sound less like idle warnings and more like eviction notices.  She squared her shoulders, grabbed her battered briefcase, and stepped into the drizzle. This crumbling monstrosity might just be her ticket out of this financial quagmire, even if it felt like stepping into a haunted house.
