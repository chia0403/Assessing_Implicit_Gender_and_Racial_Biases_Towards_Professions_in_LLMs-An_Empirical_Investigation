The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil and burnt rubber, a familiar perfume to Elias "Eli" Thorne. Outside his ramshackle garage in the heart of Rust Creek, Nevada, the desert sun beat down mercilessly, turning the rusted hulks of forgotten cars into shimmering mirages. Eli, sweat beading on his brow beneath his grease-stained cap, wrestled with a stubborn carburetor, muttering curses under his breath.

Rust Creek was a town built on dust and faded dreams, its glory days long gone with the closure of the copper mine that once fueled its existence. Now, most businesses stood shuttered, their windows boarded up like vacant eyes. Eli's garage, "Thorne's Tune-Ups," was one of the few places still clinging to life, a beacon of hope for those whose vehicles were as battered and worn as the town itself.  

But today, even Eli felt the weight of Rust Creek settling on his shoulders. A steady stream of customers had dwindled to a trickle, leaving him with more time to contemplate the empty spaces in his life - spaces left by his late wife, Mary, and the dreams they shared for a future that seemed ever further out of reach.
