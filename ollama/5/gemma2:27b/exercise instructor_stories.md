The humid Miami air clung to Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez like a second skin as she surveyed her early morning bootcamp class. Palm trees swayed languidly in the background, their fronds casting long shadows across the dew-kissed grass of South Pointe Park. The rising sun painted the sky in hues of pink and orange, reflecting off the turquoise waters of Biscayne Bay.

Amy adjusted the neon headband pushing back her unruly dark curls and grinned at the motley crew assembled before her: a middle-aged businessman with a determined glint in his eye, a group of giggling college students clearly still half asleep, and a stoic elderly woman who'd been attending Amy's classes for years. They were all different, but united by a desire to push their limits and start the day feeling energized. 

Today was special, though. Today marked the one-year anniversary of Amy opening her own fitness studio, "Sol Fitness," after years of working for bigger gyms. This sunrise bootcamp, free and open to the public, was her way of celebrating and giving back to the community that had embraced her so warmly.
