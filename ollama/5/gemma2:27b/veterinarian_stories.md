Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Dr. Amelia Blackwood's clinic, blurring the lights of Main Street into shimmering streaks. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old sign that creaked above the door: "Blackwood Veterinary - Caring for Critters Great & Small". Inside, Amelia sighed, her breath fogging the air as she leaned against the exam table. A storm always seemed to dampen spirits, human and animal alike. 

The clinic was quiet tonight, a rarity in Harmony Creek, a small town nestled amongst rolling hills where everyone knew their neighbour's pet by name. But even the most resilient creatures seemed to be hunkering down tonight, leaving Amelia with nothing but the rhythmic ticking of the antique clock on the wall and the distant rumble of thunder.  She idly traced the worn inscription on the table: "Hope heals."  It was her grandfather's motto, the one that had inspired her to follow in his footsteps.

Suddenly, a sharp rapping at the door jolted Amelia from her thoughts. She straightened, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and wiping her hands on her apron. The storm was intensifying, but whoever it was needed help, and Amelia Blackwood never turned away a creature in need.  "Coming!" she called out, her voice echoing through the empty clinic as she hurried towards the door.
