Outside, the cacophony of bartering merchants and gossiping housewives rose and fell like the tide, but within Esme's sanctuary, a calming silence reigned.

The emerald silk shimmered, promising untold beauty, yet it felt empty, devoid of the story it was meant to tell. This commission, for the cityâ€™s esteemed Oracle, held the weight of not just one life but an entire prophecy. And Esme feared she might be out of her depth.
