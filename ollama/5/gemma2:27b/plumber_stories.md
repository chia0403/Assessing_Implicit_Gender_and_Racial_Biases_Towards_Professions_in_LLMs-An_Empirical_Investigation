Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, drumming a relentless rhythm that echoed through Elias Bartholomew's cramped workshop. The air hung heavy with the scent of rust and mildew, punctuated by the sharp tang of soldering flux. Elias himself, a burly man with hands perpetually stained copper green and hair perpetually damp from the ever-present drizzle of his seaside town, hunched over a cracked porcelain sink, muttering curses under his breath as he wrestled with a stubborn pipe fitting. 

The phone, perched precariously on a stack of overflowing invoices, began to shriek its tinny melody. Elias sighed, wiping grease on his already filthy apron.  He knew it would be another leaky faucet, a backed-up toilet, or perhaps even Mrs. Higgins' annual plea for him to unclog her eternally clogged bath drain. Plumbing wasn't glamorous, but it was honest work in Grimsborough, a town where the sea wind seemed to carry the scent of salt and despair in equal measure.
