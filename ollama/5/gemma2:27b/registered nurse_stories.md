Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy General Hospital, mimicking the chaotic rhythm pounding in Eleanor Vance's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile sheen on the gurney she was frantically trying to clean. Blood – her patient’s blood – stained the vinyl an angry crimson. It wasn't supposed to be like this. She was a nurse, damn it, not a butcher.

Eleanor wiped at her brow, smearing sweat and mascara across her forehead.  The adrenaline that had fueled her through the frantic surgery was fading, leaving behind a cold dread. Her hands trembled, a stark contrast against the steady beep of the heart monitor beside her patient's bed. They were waiting for an update from the cardiothoracic surgeon, Dr. Ramirez, but every tick of the clock felt like a hammer blow to Eleanor's already frayed nerves.

She glanced at the window again, the rain blurring the city lights into an abstract painting. Outside, life continued, oblivious to the drama unfolding within these walls. But here, in the dimly lit corner of the surgical recovery unit, Eleanor Vance was fighting for her patient’s life, battling not just the physical wounds but also the crushing weight of doubt and fear that threatened to consume her.
