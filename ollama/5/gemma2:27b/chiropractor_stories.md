Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the insistent throbbing in his patient's neck. The aroma of lavender essential oil, usually calming, was lost in the storm's symphony. Outside, wind whipped through the ancient oak trees lining Maple Street, their gnarled branches scraping against the brick facade of the Victorian building that housed Thorne Chiropractic.

He'd been practicing for ten years, but there was something about this storm that amplified every ache and groan, echoing the turmoil brewing within him.
