Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elara Vance's tiny studio, each drop a staccato beat in the symphony of the storm. The air hung thick with the scent of rain-soaked earth and developing chemicals, a smell Elara had always found comforting. Outside, the neon glow of Hong Kong nightlife blurred into streaks of colour through the grimy windowpane. Inside, her darkroom pulsed with a warm, red light, illuminating rows of silver gelatin prints drying on lines strung across the cramped space.

Elara adjusted the focus on her enlarger, the faint hum a familiar lullaby. Tonight, she was working on a series documenting the city's neon signs â€“ ghostly apparitions flickering against the inky canvas of the night sky. Each photograph was a fleeting moment captured forever, a testament to the ephemeral beauty that pulsed through Hong Kong's veins.
