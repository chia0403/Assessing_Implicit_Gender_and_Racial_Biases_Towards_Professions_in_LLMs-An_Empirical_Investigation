This time, Ellie felt a shiver of trepidation mixed with her usual steely resolve.  

Outside, the storm raged on, and Ellie knew she couldn't afford to wait any longer. She grabbed her battered raincoat, its faded blue mirroring her own weary spirit, and stepped out into the night, ready to face whatever secrets awaited her in the city’s underbelly.
