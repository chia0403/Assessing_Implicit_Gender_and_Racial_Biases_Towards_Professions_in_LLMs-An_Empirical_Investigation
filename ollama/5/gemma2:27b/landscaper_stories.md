The humid Florida air clung to Elias Finnigan like a damp shirt as he wrestled with a stubborn bougainvillea vine. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes, but Elias ignored it. He was used to the relentless sun and the sticky heat; it was part of the job. Besides, the vibrant fuchsia blooms were worth the struggle. 

Eliasâ€™s landscaping business, "Finnigan Flora," was a small operation, catering mainly to the retirees who dotted the pastel-colored houses lining Palm Bay Drive. Today, he was working on Mrs. Henderson's yard, a sprawling patch of bougainvillea, hibiscus, and palm trees that demanded constant attention. As Elias wrestled with the vine, his mind drifted, imagining the cool shade of the oak tree at the edge of the property, where he often took refuge during his lunch break.

But today was different. Today, Mrs. Henderson had mentioned a strange occurrence: an unsettling humming sound coming from the empty lot next door. It had started a few nights ago, she said, and it seemed to be getting louder. Elias, a pragmatist at heart, dismissed it as wind chimes or some other mundane explanation. Still, a flicker of curiosity sparked within him.
