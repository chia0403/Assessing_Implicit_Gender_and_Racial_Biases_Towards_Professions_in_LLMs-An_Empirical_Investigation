The Nevada sun beat down on Silas "Si" Hawthorne's neck like a branding iron. Sweat trickled down his temple, stinging his eyes as he leaned over the asphalt patch, meticulously smoothing it with his trowel. The endless ribbon of Highway 93 stretched out before him, shimmering in the heat haze. Si could hear the distant drone of an eighteen-wheeler approaching, its rumble a constant reminder of the relentless flow of traffic that roared past his work site every day.

Si wasn't sure what was worse – the scorching sun or the boredom. Days bled into weeks, each one a monotonous cycle of patching potholes, replacing guardrails, and clearing debris. He dreamed of escape, of leaving this dusty highway behind and venturing out to explore the world beyond. But Si had responsibilities – a mother in a nursing home needing care, bills piling up on his kitchen table. For now, Highway 93 was his cage, his asphalt world a testament to the sacrifices he made every day.

He wiped his brow with a grease-stained handkerchief, squinting at the horizon. The landscape was bleak and beautiful – a vast expanse of ochre desert punctuated by thorny Joshua trees and rugged mountains that shimmered in the distance. Somewhere out there, Si thought, lay adventure. But for now, he had potholes to fill.
