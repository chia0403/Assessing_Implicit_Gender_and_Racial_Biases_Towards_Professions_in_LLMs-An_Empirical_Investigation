Rain hammered against the warped glass of Elias Blackwood's office window, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street into an Impressionist smear. The smell of cheap whiskey and stale cigarette smoke hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of a busted grandfather clock in the corner. Elias, his face etched with years of hard living and bad decisions, sat hunched over his desk, a half-empty bottle of bourbon sweating beside him. A single flickering bulb cast long shadows across his rumpled trench coat and the stacks of dusty files piled high on every surface.

The phone, a battered rotary relic from a bygone era, jangled harshly, jolting Elias from his brooding. He squinted at the caller ID â€“ "Blocked."  He sighed, knowing it was probably another deadbeat client or a crank call, but something in his gut told him to answer. 


"Blackwood Investigations," he growled into the receiver, his voice raspy from too many cigarettes and not enough sleep.
