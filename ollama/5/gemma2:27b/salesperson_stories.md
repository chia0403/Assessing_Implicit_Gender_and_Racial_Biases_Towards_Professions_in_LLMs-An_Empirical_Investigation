The air conditioning in Elias Finch's used car lot wheezed like an asthmatic dragon, barely making a dent in the sweltering July heat. Beads of sweat trickled down Elias's forehead as he adjusted his tie for the tenth time that morning. The polyester clung to him like a second skin, amplifying the discomfort. Outside, cicadas screamed their relentless chorus, blending with the distant hum of traffic on Highway 49.

Elias wasn't afraid of hard work, but this heatwave was testing even his boundless enthusiasm. He glanced at the row of dusty vehicles lining his lot, each one a potential sale waiting to be unlocked. Today, he had his sights set on Mrs. Henderson, an elderly widow who had expressed interest in a pre-owned Honda Civic. He imagined her smiling face behind the wheel, feeling the freedom and independence that came with owning a car. That's what Elias loved about his job - connecting people with vehicles that would change their lives for the better. 

But first, he had to navigate this infernal heat.
