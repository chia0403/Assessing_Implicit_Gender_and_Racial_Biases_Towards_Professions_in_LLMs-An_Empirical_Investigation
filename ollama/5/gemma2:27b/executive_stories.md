Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Alistair Montgomery's 42nd-floor office, blurring the glittering cityscape below into an impressionistic mess. The wind howled like a banshee, shaking the skyscraper ever so slightly, and Alistair barely registered it. His focus was entirely on the sleek black tablet in his hand, the numbers dancing across its screen demanding his attention. 

Alistair Montgomery, CEO of Montgomery Industries, wasn't a man easily rattled. He'd built his empire from the ground up, weathering countless storms both literal and metaphorical. Yet, tonight felt different. The figures before him painted a bleak picture: declining profits, stagnating market share, and a looming threat from a ruthless competitor.

He tapped the screen impatiently, summoning the latest projections. A chill snaked down his spine as he saw the predicted trajectory. Unless something drastic was done, Montgomery Industries could be teetering on the brink of collapse within the year.
