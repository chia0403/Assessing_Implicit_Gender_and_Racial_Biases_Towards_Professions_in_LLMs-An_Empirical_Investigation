The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and simmering garlic as Beatrice "Bea" Moreau stirred the massive pot of bouillabaisse. Steam rose from the crimson broth, carrying with it whispers of saffron, thyme, and the briny tang of the Mediterranean Sea. Outside her tiny Marseille kitchen window, the sun dipped towards the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and dusky purple.  Bea wiped a stray bead of sweat from her brow, her weathered hand leaving a smear of red pepper oil on her forehead. The clatter of fishing boats returning to the Vieux Port echoed through the narrow cobblestone streets, their calls mingling with the distant strains of accordion music drifting from a nearby café. Tonight was the annual Fête de la Pêche, and Bea's bouillabaisse, a recipe passed down through generations, was the star attraction.
