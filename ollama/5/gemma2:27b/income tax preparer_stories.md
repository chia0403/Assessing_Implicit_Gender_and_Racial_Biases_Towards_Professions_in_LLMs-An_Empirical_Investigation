Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon sign of "Al's Discount Donuts" across the street. The smell of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Beatrice Ophelia Thistlewick's office.  Beatrice, or Bea as she preferred (though few dared call her anything but Ms. Thistlewick), hunched over a stack of W-2 forms, her bifocals perched precariously on the bridge of her nose. 

Tax season had arrived like an unwelcome plague, transforming her normally quiet office into a whirlwind of anxiety and last-minute deductions. The incessant buzzing of her phone, punctuated by the frantic staccato of keyboard keys, was a constant reminder that she was drowning in a sea of receipts, charitable donations, and dubious business expenses.

But Bea Thistlewick thrived in the chaos. She saw herself as a financial guardian angel, guiding the confused and overwhelmed through the labyrinthine world of tax codes.
