Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane, blurring the neon sign across the street that declared "Paradise Awaits."  Eleanor Cartwright sighed, her reflection momentarily obscured by the deluge before reappearing – tired eyes framed by spectacles, auburn hair escaping its bun in rebellious wisps. Her small travel agency, nestled between a boisterous pizzeria and a perpetually closed antique shop, was as quiet as a mausoleum.

The phone hadn't rung all day.  Eleanor idly traced a heart onto the condensation that had formed on her window, a tiny rebellion against the dreary afternoon. Outside, tourists huddled under umbrellas, their faces obscured by raincoats, hurrying past without a glance at her agency's inviting glow. 


Eleanor yearned for the day she could escape this grey existence and sell tickets to those mythical paradises she so often dreamed of. Today, however, all she had was paperwork – invoices, confirmations, and a stack of brochures that promised sun-drenched beaches and vibrant cultures, but only served as a painful reminder of her own unfulfilled wanderlust.
