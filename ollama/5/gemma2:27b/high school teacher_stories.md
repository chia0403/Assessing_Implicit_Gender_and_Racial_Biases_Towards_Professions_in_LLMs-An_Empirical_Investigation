The bell for fourth period should have rung minutes ago, but the power flickered ominously, threatening to plunge them all into darkness.  Eleanor wasn't sure if it was the weather or the approaching end of the semester, but a pervasive sense of gloom hung over Northwood High today. Even her usually boisterous class of seniors seemed subdued, their faces pale reflections in the flickering fluorescent lights.
