The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's office smelled perpetually of old paper and dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight that slanted through the grimy windowpane. Bart himself was no stranger to dust; fine, grey particles clung to his waistcoat and the neatly combed silver hair that framed a face permanently creased with concentration. He sat hunched over his ledger, a battered tome bound in cracked leather, its pages filled with spidery handwriting and columns of figures that danced before his eyes.

Outside, the cobbled streets of Pennyworth buzzed with midday activity: vendors hawking their wares, children chasing pigeons through the square, the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith's hammer. But Bart was oblivious to it all, lost in the labyrinthine world of debits and credits. For him, the quiet hum of his quill scratching across parchment was the only symphony he needed.

Today, however, a prickling unease disrupted his usual focus. A letter lay unopened on his desk, the wax seal bearing an unfamiliar crest â€“ a coiled serpent entwined around a silver sword. The script on the envelope, elegant and spidery, hinted at something beyond the mundane requests for balance sheets that usually graced his doormat. This letter, Bart knew instinctively, promised something far more intriguing, and perhaps, far more dangerous.
