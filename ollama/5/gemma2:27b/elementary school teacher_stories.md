Rain lashed against the classroom windows, blurring the vibrant fall colors outside into streaks of orange and yellow. The air smelled faintly of wet leaves and crayons, a comforting combination that usually soothed Amelia Grace Winthrop. Today, however, it did little to quell the storm brewing in her stomach.
