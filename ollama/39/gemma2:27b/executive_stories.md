Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Alistair Cavendish's corner office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The city lights, normally a glittering tapestry below, were blurred into an impressionistic smear by the deluge.  Alistair, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit that seemed to absorb even the dim light filtering through the clouds, tapped his pen impatiently against the mahogany desk. His phone lay silent, mocking him with its lack of response.

He was accustomed to control, to having every detail meticulously planned and executed. But this latest acquisition – Titan Industries, a behemoth in the renewable energy sector – was proving to be more unruly than anticipated. Negotiations had stalled, whispers of sabotage circulated, and Alistair felt an unfamiliar knot of anxiety tightening in his chest. This deal, meant to solidify Cavendish Enterprises as a global leader in sustainable development, now threatened to unravel his carefully crafted empire.

He needed answers, and he needed them fast.
