The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and almond, a sweet fog that clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's apron like a second skin. Outside the bakery window, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone street, painting the quaint village of Oakhaven in a warm, golden hue. Inside "Sugar & Spice," however, it was always summertime. The ovens hummed a constant lullaby, and Amelia’s nimble fingers danced across a canvas of buttercream, transforming a plain white cake into a swirling galaxy of edible stars.

Today, she was working on a masterpiece for the annual Oakhaven Midsummer Festival: a three-tiered wonder adorned with sugar flowers blooming in impossible hues, delicate spun-sugar butterflies flitting between them, and a cascading waterfall of shimmering chocolate. It was a challenge worthy of her talent, one that made Amelia’s heart beat faster with each precise stroke of her piping bag. But as she meticulously sculpted a tiny hummingbird from marzipan, a shadow fell across the counter.

Turning, Amelia found herself face to face with a stranger – tall, imposing, and with eyes as blue as the forget-me-nots she was planning to sprinkle around the base of the cake.
