Rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Elara Finch's tiny studio apartment, blurring the cityscape beyond into a watercolour wash of greys and yellows. The city hummed beneath her, a constant thrumming pulse she usually found comforting but tonight felt oppressive, mirroring the tension knotting in her stomach. 

Elara stared at the glowing screen of her Macbook Pro, the cursor blinking accusingly beside a half-finished logo design. "The Bloomery," it was supposed to be â€“ a whimsical floral shop opening in the trendy Lower East Side. But instead of blooming with creativity, Elara felt wilted.  

She needed this job. Her freelance gigs had dried up, and rent was due next week. A sense of panic crept into her chest as she remembered the landlord's gruff reminder just that morning. "Pay up or pack up," he'd growled, his words echoing in her mind like a death knell.
