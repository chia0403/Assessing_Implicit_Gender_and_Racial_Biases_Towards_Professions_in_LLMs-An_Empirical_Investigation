The rooster's crow was swallowed whole by the relentless wind whipping across Silas Blackwood's wheat field.  Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking the meager green shoots struggling to push through the parched earth. Silas, his face weathered and etched with worry lines deeper than any furrow he plowed, pulled his worn cap lower over his greying hair. The sun, a cruel orange eye in the hazy sky, promised another day of unforgiving heat.  

Silas surveyed his land, his calloused hands clenched into fists. His family had farmed this patch of earth for generations, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons. But this year, the rains hadn't come. The well was running dry, and the whispers in town spoke of a drought unlike any they'd seen before.

Hope, though brittle as dried wheat stalks, still flickered in Silas's chest. He remembered his grandfather's tales of resilience, of weathering storms both literal and metaphorical. Silas Blackwood was a farmer, damn it, and farmers didn't give up easily.
