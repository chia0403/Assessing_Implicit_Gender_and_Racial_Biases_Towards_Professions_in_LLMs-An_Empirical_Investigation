The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn carpet and scuffed plastic chairs lining the waiting room. Elara Winthrop smoothed her skirt, the polyester scratching against her knees. It was 8:57 AM – three minutes until the deluge. The phone would begin to shriek, demanding appointments be rescheduled, insurance information verified, and directions given with unwavering cheer.

Elara hated mornings. Especially Mondays. 

She glanced out the window at the grey sky mirroring her mood. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already indistinct view of the bustling city street below.  Dr. Hawthorne's office wasn't in the most glamorous part of town. It nestled amongst pawn shops and laundromats, a beacon of hope for those who couldn't afford the fancy clinics downtown. 


Elara sighed. Despite her reservations about the early hours and the endless stream of anxious patients, she knew this was important work. She was often the first friendly face they saw – a comforting presence in times of uncertainty. Still, a tiny part of her yearned for something more, something beyond the monotonous click-clack of the keyboard and the incessant ringing of the phone. Something that sparked joy instead of weary resignation.
