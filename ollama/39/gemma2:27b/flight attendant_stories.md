The recycled air hummed a monotonous tune, barely masking the low murmur of anxious passengers settling into their seats. Amelia Cartwright adjusted her navy blue scarf, ensuring it lay perfectly against her crisp white shirt. The overhead lights flickered on, illuminating rows of expectant faces. Amelia plastered on her most reassuring smile â€“ one she'd perfected over years of navigating turbulent skies and unpredictable human behaviour. 

She was aboard Flight 714 from London Heathrow to Singapore, a twelve-hour journey across continents. The familiar pre-flight jitters fluttered in her stomach, a cocktail of excitement and apprehension she always felt before take-off. This wasn't just another routine flight; this was Amelia's final journey before retiring after twenty years with Skyway Airlines.

The plane shuddered as the engines roared to life, pulling them away from the bustling London airport. Outside, the fading twilight painted the sky in hues of orange and purple. As Amelia strapped herself into her jump seat, she couldn't help but wonder what awaited her on this last adventure.
