The bell shrieked, its metallic wail echoing through the near-empty hallways of Northwood High. Eloise Ainsworth sighed, pushing her chair back from her desk with a groan that rivaled the bell's harshness.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sun filtering through the window, illuminating the worn surface of her history textbooks. Another Friday had ended, another week spent battling apathy and the allure of Snapchat amongst her sophomore students.

Eloise loved teaching, truly she did. There was a flicker of satisfaction in witnessing a student's eyes light up with understanding, or hearing them debate historical events with newfound passion. But lately, that flicker felt dimmer, harder to find. The energy Eloise once brought to the classroom seemed to be fading, replaced by a weary resignation. Maybe it was the endless standardized testing, the budget cuts that left her scavenging for supplies, or the feeling that she was constantly swimming against a tide of indifference. Whatever the reason, Northwood High felt more like a prison than a place of learning these days.  

Today, however, something felt different. A faint buzz in Eloise's pocket pulled her attention away from her dwindling enthusiasm. It wasnâ€™t her phone; it was the antique compass she always carried, a gift from her grandfather, a man who had filled her childhood with tales of faraway lands and whispered promises of adventure. The needle spun wildly, then abruptly pointed towards the old oak tree outside her classroom window. Eloise frowned, her curiosity piqued. That tree had stood sentinel over Northwood High for generations, its gnarled branches whispering secrets to the wind. What could it possibly want from her?
