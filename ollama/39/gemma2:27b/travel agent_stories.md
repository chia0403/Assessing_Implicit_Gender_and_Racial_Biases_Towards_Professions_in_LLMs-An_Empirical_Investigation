Rain hammered against the windowpanes of "Wanderlust Travels," blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into an indecipherable smear. Amelia Rose Thornton sighed, her reflection distorted in the glass. Outside, London was drowning in a November tempest, but inside, it was stiflingly still. Not a single soul had crossed the threshold all morning.

Amelia traced the outline of a turquoise parrot painted on a vintage suitcase propped against the wall. It was a reminder of Fiji, where she'd spent her honeymoon, blissfully unaware that two years later she'd be running her late grandmother's travel agency, desperately trying to keep it afloat in a world increasingly obsessed with online booking platforms.

Today, however, Amelia wasn't drowning in despair. Today, an email had arrived, promising something far more enticing than discounted flights and last-minute deals. It promised adventure.
