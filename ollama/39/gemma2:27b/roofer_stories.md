The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck as he wrestled a stubborn shingle into place. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of tar and asphalt, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of his hammer against nails. Below him, the sprawling cityscape of Newhaven stretched out like a rumpled tapestry, its streets choked with midday traffic and its inhabitants oblivious to the precarious dance Silas performed atop the three-story office building. He preferred the view from up here, where the noise faded into a dull roar and he could lose himself in the repetitive rhythm of his work.

Silas wasn't one for crowds or chatter. Give him a toolbox, a steep slope, and the challenge of coaxing recalcitrant shingles into submission, and he was content. He knew every nuance of the trade, from the precise angle needed to lay a flashing to the subtle differences between slate and asphalt. It was honest work, demanding yet satisfying. 

But today, something felt off.  A prickle of unease ran down Silas's spine as he surveyed the street below. A black sedan sat parked across the way, its tinted windows reflecting the sun like watchful eyes. He dismissed it initially, but as he continued his work, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.
