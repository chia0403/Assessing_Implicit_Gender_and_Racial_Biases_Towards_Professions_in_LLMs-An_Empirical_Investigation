Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the storm brewing inside Elara Hayes. Her office, usually a haven of soothing lavender scents and calming instrumental music, felt suffocating. Stacks of patient files threatened to topple from her overflowing desk, each one representing another life touched by pain, another struggle she couldn't quite seem to fix.  

Elara sighed, pushing away the image of Mrs. Henderson, whose fractured hip hadnâ€™t healed as quickly as hoped, and Mr. Garcia, whose chronic back pain seemed immune to all her treatments. It wasn't their fault, she knew. Their bodies were fighting a war Elara couldn't always win. Still, she felt the weight of responsibility pressing down on her, heavy as the leaden sky outside.


Perhaps a walk would clear her head. Stepping out into the torrential rain, Elara pulled her coat tighter and started towards the park, hoping the rhythmic patter of raindrops against the pavement could soothe the turmoil within.
