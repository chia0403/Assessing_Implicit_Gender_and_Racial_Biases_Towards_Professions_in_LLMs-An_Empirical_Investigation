The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda Rodriguez's head, casting a sterile glow over the endless parade of candy bars, gum, and overpriced magazines that lined the aisles of QuickMart. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and artificial watermelon from the bubblegum display.  It was 2:17 am, a time when even the shadows seemed exhausted. Esmeralda idly tapped her manicured nails on the counter, counting down the minutes until her shift ended.

Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of the convenience store and sending shivers down Esmeralda's spine. She glanced at the security camera mounted above the door, its red light blinking ominously. Tonight felt different, charged with an unsettling energy she couldn't quite place.
