Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy General Hospital, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic smear of yellow and grey. Inside, fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the bustling Emergency Room. Elena Ramirez, her navy blue scrubs slightly damp from rushing in from the rain-soaked parking lot, scanned the triage board with a practiced eye. Three trauma cases were currently vying for her attention, each code a symphony of urgency: red, orange, yellow.

Elena took a deep breath, steeling herself. She'd been an ER nurse for five years now, and had seen her share of chaos and heartbreak. But the relentless rhythm of adrenaline and compassion was what kept her coming back, shift after grueling shift. Tonight, however, felt different. A gnawing sense of unease twisted in her gut as she mentally prepared herself for whatever horrors might walk through those doors next.
