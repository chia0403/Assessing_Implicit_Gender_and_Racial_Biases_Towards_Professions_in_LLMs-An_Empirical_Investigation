Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her own chest. The worn leather armchair across from her desk sat vacant, a testament to the canceled appointment that had just thrown her afternoon into disarray. It wasn't unusual for clients to cancel last minute, especially in this weather, but Eleanor couldn't shake the gnawing feeling of unease that accompanied it.

Her office, nestled on the top floor of a rambling Victorian house overlooking San Francisco Bay, usually hummed with a comforting energy. Sunlight streamed through stained-glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across worn Persian rugs and overflowing bookshelves. But today, the storm seemed to have seeped into the very walls, muting the usual warmth and leaving Eleanor feeling adrift in a sea of her own anxieties.
