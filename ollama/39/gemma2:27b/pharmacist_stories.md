Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Apothecary's Haven," blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously above the door. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth meticulously counted out blue-green capsules, the rhythmic clatter echoing in the otherwise silent shop. The air smelled faintly of chamomile and lavender, a comforting aroma she’d painstakingly cultivated over years.

Outside, wind howled down Elm Street, whipping fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes. Eleanor glanced at the clock – 10:47 pm.  Most folks were safely tucked away for the night, but this late-night lull was nothing unusual for her. In a quaint town like Willow Creek, even pharmacists occasionally doubled as nocturnal confidants.

She sighed, tucking the capsules into a vial. Tonight's visitor, however, wouldn't be seeking solace in lavender or chamomile. Eleanor had sensed it from the moment he stepped inside – a tall, gaunt figure shrouded in shadows, his face obscured by the brim of a worn fedora. The air around him crackled with an unsettling energy, leaving her with a prickling sensation on the back of her neck.
