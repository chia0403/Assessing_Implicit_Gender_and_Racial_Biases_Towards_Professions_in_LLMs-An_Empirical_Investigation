The air in the Grand Blackwood Library hung thick with the scent of aged paper and leather, a comforting aroma to Eleanor Ainsworth-Whitby, Head Librarian for the past twenty years. Sunlight streamed through the arched Gothic windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path. The library was Eleanor's sanctuary, a labyrinthine haven where stories whispered from countless volumes lining the shelves that stretched towards the vaulted ceiling. Today, however, a disquieting silence hung heavy over the usually bustling space.  

Eleanor paused at the top of the grand oak staircase, her hand resting on the polished banister. Something felt amiss. The rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the reading room seemed amplified, each second a hammer blow against the unsettling quiet. She descended the stairs, her sensible shoes clicking on the marble floor, her gaze sweeping across the empty tables and silent rows of patrons. 

Where was everyone?
