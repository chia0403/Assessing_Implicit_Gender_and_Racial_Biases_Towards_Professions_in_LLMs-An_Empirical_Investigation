Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic tempo of Eleanor Blackwood's fingers flying across the keyboard. The scent of damp wood and old paper hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea steeping on a rickety table beside her. Dust motes danced in the sliver of moonlight that pierced through a gap in the boarded-up window, illuminating Eleanor's face â€“ pale and drawn, framed by unruly curls the colour of autumn leaves. Her attic studio, crammed with stacks of dog-eared novels, overflowing notebooks, and dusty typewriters, was her sanctuary, a world away from the bustling city below and the suffocating expectations that came with being the only daughter of a renowned literary dynasty. Tonight, however, even this haven felt oppressive. 

Eleanor stared at the blinking cursor on the screen, a digital embodiment of the writer's block that had plagued her for weeks. Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in a crumbling manor house on the windswept Yorkshire moors, refused to budge beyond its first chapter.  The characters were flat, the plot meandering, and the atmosphere, meant to be chilling, felt more like lukewarm bathwater.
