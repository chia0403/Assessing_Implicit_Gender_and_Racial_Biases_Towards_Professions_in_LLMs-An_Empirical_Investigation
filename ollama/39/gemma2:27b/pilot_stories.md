The pre-dawn air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Amelia "Ace" Cortez like a second skin as she walked towards her Cessna 172. The runway at Isla Verde Airport in Puerto Rico shimmered under the nascent light, reflecting the orange and pink hues creeping across the horizon. Ace ran a hand through her short, dark hair, feeling the grit of yesterday's flight still clinging to it.  She could smell the salt air mingled with the tang of jet fuel â€“ a scent she found oddly comforting. Today was a cargo run: medical supplies destined for the remote mountain village of Adjuntas. 

Ace loved these runs. They weren't glamorous, but they were vital, connecting communities often cut off by treacherous terrain. Looking up at the Cessna, its paint faded but well-maintained, Ace felt a familiar surge of anticipation. This machine was her partner in adventure, and today, she knew, it would carry hope to those who needed it most.
