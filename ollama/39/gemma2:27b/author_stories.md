Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a miniature drumbeat against the aging glass. Amelia Winthrop Hawthorne, renowned author of gothic mysteries, sat hunched over her antique writing desk, a frown etched on her usually serene face. The room, illuminated only by a flickering gas lamp, was crammed with dusty tomes and stacks of handwritten manuscripts.

Outside, thunder rumbled like a disgruntled giant, echoing the storm brewing within Amelia. Her latest novel, a chilling tale set in a crumbling manor house haunted by vengeful spirits, had hit a snag. The ending, once clear as day, now felt muddled, the climax lacking the punch she craved.  Frustration gnawed at her, threatening to unravel the carefully woven threads of her narrative.

She rose from her chair, her woolen shawl rustling softly, and paced towards the window. Peering through the rain-streaked glass, she could just make out the silhouette of the ancient oak tree swaying ominously in the wind. It was a sight straight out of one of her own novels, and Amelia couldn't help but feel a sense of déjà vu.

Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminated the sky, followed by a deafening clap of thunder that shook the house to its core. As Amelia gasped, a gust of wind slammed the attic door open with a resounding bang. A cold draught swept through the room, extinguishing the gas lamp and plunging her into darkness.

Fear, sharp and unexpected, pricked at Amelia's skin. This wasn't part of her story.
