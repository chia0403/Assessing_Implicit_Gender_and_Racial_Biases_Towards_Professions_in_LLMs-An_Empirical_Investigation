The air in the Blackwood Manor hung thick with dust motes dancing in the pale morning sunlight filtering through grimy windows. Elara Finch, her silver braid bouncing with each step, surveyed the cavernous drawing-room with a sigh. Cobwebs draped the ornate chandelier like macabre tinsel, and a layer of grime coated every surface. It was always like this when the Blackwoods were away on their extended "continental tours," leaving Elara to grapple with the dust bunnies and decaying grandeur of their ancestral home.

She tugged her threadbare gloves tighter, the faded floral pattern a ghostly reminder of better days. This house, once bustling with laughter and music, now echoed with only the mournful creak of floorboards and the distant cawing of crows. 

Today, however, a sense of anticipation prickled beneath Elara's weary resignation. The Blackwoods were due back that very afternoon, bringing with them whispers of a new addition to the family - a young bride. Elara couldnâ€™t help but wonder what kind of woman would choose to join this crumbling dynasty.
