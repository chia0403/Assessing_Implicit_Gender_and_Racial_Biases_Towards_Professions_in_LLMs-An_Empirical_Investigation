Rain lashed against the glass front of "Petal & Bloom," blurring the vibrant colours of the dahlias and lilies within. Eleanor Rosethorn sighed, watching the deluge turn the cobblestone street into a rushing river. It was supposed to be her busiest day - Valentine's Day - but the weather had seemingly conspired against love. Usually, the shop would be buzzing with last-minute romantics grabbing bouquets and single roses. Today, however, it was eerily quiet, save for the soft tinkling of wind chimes strung above the door. Eleanor idly twisted a strand of her auburn hair, feeling a pang of disappointment.

She loved her little shop nestled in the heart of Edinburgh's historic Grassmarket. The scent of fresh blooms always lifted her spirits, and she took pride in crafting unique arrangements that spoke to each individual's sentiment. But today, even the heady fragrance of garden roses couldn't dispel the gloom settling over her.
