The air hung thick and heavy with humidity, clinging to Jasper "Jaybird" Calloway like a second skin as he wrestled his eighteen-wheeler into the dusty truck stop off Highway 61.  Cicadas throbbed in the sycamore trees that lined the lot, their rhythmic chirping blending with the low growl of idling engines and the sizzle of bacon from the greasy spoon diner. Jaybird, weary from a fourteen-hour haul through Mississippi's sweltering heartland, eased himself out of the cab, his knees popping like overripe popcorn kernels. 

His rig, "Sweet Georgia Brown", was a faded turquoise Peterbilt with chrome accents glinting in the setting sun.  She'd seen better days, just like Jaybird himself, but she got him where he needed to go, and that was all that mattered.
