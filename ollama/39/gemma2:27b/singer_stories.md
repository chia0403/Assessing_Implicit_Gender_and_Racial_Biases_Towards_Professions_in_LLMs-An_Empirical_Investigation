Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mic, the relentless drumming mirroring the frantic beat in Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather's chest. The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke and spilled beer, a haze illuminated by flickering neon signs advertising cheap drinks and forgotten dreams. Sera clutched her battered acoustic guitar, its worn wood smooth beneath her calloused fingers. Tonight was her last chance. The club owner, a gruff man named Knuckles who looked like he'd wrestled bears for breakfast, had given her an ultimatum: wow the crowd tonight or lose her regular slot. 


Sera swallowed hard, her throat dry. A tangle of nerves tightened in her stomach. She wasn't known for her ballads, she thrived on raw energy and gritty lyrics that spoke of love lost and battles fought. But Knuckles wanted something different, something to draw in a bigger crowd. He'd suggested a classic, something the regulars would sing along to. 

But Sera couldn't bring herself to play someone else's song. Not tonight. Not when her own heart was overflowing with melodies yearning to be heard.
