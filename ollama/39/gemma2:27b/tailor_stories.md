The flickering gas lamp cast elongated shadows across Eloise Beaumont's cluttered workshop.  The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax, lavender sachet stuffing, and the faint, sweet decay of old cloth. Outside, the cobbled streets of London's Whitechapel district thrummed with the sounds of late-night revelry and distant shouts. But inside, Eloise was lost in the intricate dance of her needle, stitching a delicate rosebud onto the bodice of a velvet gown destined for a wealthy socialiteâ€™s ball.

Her workshop, tucked away above Mrs. Higgins' bakery, was a haven from the harsh realities of life on the streets. Bolts of vibrant silk and linen lined the walls, each roll a promise whispered in muted hues.  Skeins of thread, like shimmering rainbows, spilled from baskets. And amidst it all, Eloise worked with the calm focus of a woman who found solace in the rhythmic click of her shears and the soft tug of thread through fabric.

Tonight, however, a knot of unease tightened in Eloise's chest. The whispers swirling around Whitechapel had grown darker, tales of shadows stalking the fog-choked alleys, and women vanishing without a trace. Eloise, with her sharp eyes and even sharper wit, couldn't shake the feeling that something wicked was brewing.
