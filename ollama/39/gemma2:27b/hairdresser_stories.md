The humid air hung heavy in "Curl Up & Dye," smelling sweetly of coconut oil and burnt hairspray. Estelle Beatrice Dubois, her name emblazoned in elegant cursive above the salon door, expertly snipped away at Mrs. Henderson's overgrown poodle perm. Estelle wasn't just a hairdresser; she was an artist, sculpting dreams into hair with her nimble fingers and razor-sharp wit.

The year was 1968, and Savannah, Georgia, simmered under a relentless summer sun. The air crackled with the promise of change, whispers of civil rights marches and anti-war protests reaching even this sleepy corner of the South. But within the brightly painted walls of "Curl Up & Dye," time seemed to stand still. Estelle's regulars, mostly Southern belles and gossiping housewives, settled into their familiar routines – swapping recipes, lamenting lost loves, and preening under Estelle's attentive gaze.

Today, however, a strange tension hung in the air. A young woman, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, sat nervously in the waiting area. Estelle couldn’t shake the feeling that this newcomer held a secret, one as tangled and alluring as a braid begging to be undone.
