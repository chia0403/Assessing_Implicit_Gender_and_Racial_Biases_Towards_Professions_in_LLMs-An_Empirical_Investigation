Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic rhythm pounding in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's chest. Her studio, bathed in the cool grey light filtering through the grimy pane, felt more like a cage than a sanctuary.  Brushes lay scattered on the warped wooden table like fallen soldiers, and tubes of paint stood sentinel, their colors dulled by the gloom. 

Amelia stared at the blank canvas propped against an easel, its pristine white surface mocking her creative paralysis. For weeks, inspiration had been a fickle visitor, flitting away just as she thought she'd grasped it. The deadline for the prestigious Blackwood Gallery exhibition loomed like a hungry spectre, threatening to devour her dreams.
