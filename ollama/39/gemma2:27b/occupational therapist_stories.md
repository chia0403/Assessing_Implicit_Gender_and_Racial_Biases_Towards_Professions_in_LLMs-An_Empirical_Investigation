The humid Charleston air hung heavy as Amelia Rose Callahan wrestled with the rusted latch on the dilapidated porch swing. It groaned in protest, mimicking the weary sigh escaping Amelia's lips.  She smoothed down her crisp, white blouse, already regretting choosing it for this appointment. The peeling paint and overgrown jasmine vines spoke of neglect, a stark contrast to the pristine rehabilitation center where she usually worked.

Amelia was here for Mrs. Eleanor Davenport, an octogenarian who had stubbornly refused in-patient therapy after a fall shattered her hip. Convincing Eleanor to accept any help at all had been a feat in itself, achieved through a combination of Amelia's persistent phone calls and the promise of homemade pecan pie - Eleanor's weakness. 

Now, standing on the cracked porch steps, Amelia could only hope that the pie would be enough to bridge the chasm between her modern approach to therapy and Eleanor's deeply ingrained resistance to change.  The screen door creaked open a sliver, revealing a pair of suspicious, watery blue eyes peering out from behind a curtain of silver hair.
