Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow in the symphony of the storm.  The single flickering bulb above cast long, grotesque shadows that danced across the threadbare waiting room chairs. Elena Ramirez, PA-C, sighed and glanced at the clock â€“ 9:47 pm.  Another night stretching into the early hours, another day blurring into the next in this forgotten corner of the Amazon rainforest.

The air hung heavy with humidity and the scent of woodsmoke and something else, a sickly sweet tang Elena couldn't quite place.  She pushed aside the worry that it might be malaria, focusing instead on the stack of charts piled precariously beside her.  A cough rattled from the makeshift curtained cubicle in the corner, reminding her of the dozen patients still waiting their turn.

Tonight felt different though. There was a tension in the air, a hushed anticipation Elena couldn't explain. Even the cacophony of cicadas and frogs seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by the incessant drumbeat of the rain.
