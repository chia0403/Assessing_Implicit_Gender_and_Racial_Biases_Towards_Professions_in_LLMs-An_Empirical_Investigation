Rain lashed against the windshield of Eleanor Winthrop’s vintage Ford Mustang, blurring the already muted colours of the Victorian houses lining Elm Street.  Eleanor grimaced, her perfectly manicured nails drumming nervously on the steering wheel. The For Sale sign in front of 12 Elm Street swayed ominously in the wind, its cheerful yellow clashing with the dreary grey sky. This was Eleanor's third showing this week for the old house – a charming but decidedly creaky relic that had been sitting vacant for years. Each potential buyer had balked at something: the leaky roof, the musty basement, the inexplicable chill that seemed to permeate every room. 

Eleanor knew it wasn't just the house. There was something else about this place, an unsettling energy that prickled the back of her neck.  She tried to dismiss it as nerves – she'd been feeling on edge ever since her grandmother passed away last month, leaving her the responsibility of selling this family heirloom. Still, the whispers among the locals didn't help. Tales of strange noises at night, flickering lights, and shadowy figures glimpsed in the windows lingered like a shroud over the house.

Eleanor took a deep breath and steeled herself. This was her last chance. If she couldn’t sell the house today, it would likely be condemned, torn down to make way for another generic McMansion. The thought filled her with a pang of sadness. This house held memories – her childhood summers spent exploring its dusty attic, listening to her grandmother's stories by the fireplace. She owed it to her to find it a new beginning.
