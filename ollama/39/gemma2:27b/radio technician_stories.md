The air hung thick with humidity, even at this early hour. A bead of sweat trickled down Elias Finch's temple as he wrestled with the tangle of wires behind the ancient AM transmitter. The station, KRKT, was a relic from a bygone era, its signal barely clinging to life amongst the digital giants. Its cramped studio nestled in the heart of Dusty Gulch, a town that hadn’t seen real excitement since the gold rush faded into memory. Elias, with his calloused hands and grease-stained overalls, was KRKT's sole lifeline. He kept the ancient tubes humming, coaxing music and the occasional rambling talk show out of its rusty innards.

Today, however, KRKT wasn’t broadcasting Hank Williams or local gossip about Mrs. Henderson's prize-winning zucchini. Today, Elias was expecting a visitor - someone who promised to change everything.
