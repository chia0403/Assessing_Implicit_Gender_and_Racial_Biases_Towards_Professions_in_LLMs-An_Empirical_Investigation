The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and bay rum, a familiar comfort to Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Thorne as she surveyed her domain. Sunlight streamed through the dusty storefront window, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the chrome and leather barber chairs lining the walls. Ellie's Scissors & Shears wasn't fancy, just a cozy corner shop tucked away on Elm Street, but it was hers â€“ a testament to years of hard work and a love for the art of transforming hair into something beautiful. 

Today, however, the usual rhythm of snipping shears and friendly banter was disrupted by a strange silence. Ellie glanced at the clock: 10:37 AM. Unheard of. Her regulars were always punctual, their appointments etched in their schedules with the precision of surgeons. A shiver ran down her spine. Something wasn't right.
