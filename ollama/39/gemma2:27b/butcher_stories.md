The air in "Fleisch & Blut" hung thick with the coppery scent of iron and the faint sweetness of drying blood. Wilhelm Heinrich Gruber ran a calloused thumb over the gleaming cleaver hanging by his side, its weight familiar and comforting. Dawn was just beginning to bleed across the cobblestone streets of Leipzig, painting the sky in shades of bruised plum and faded gold. It was market day, which meant Wilhelm would be up before the roosters crowed, preparing his stall for the deluge of housewives and innkeepers seeking the freshest cuts. 

Wilhelm wasn't a man prone to sentimentality, but there was something satisfying about the rhythm of his work: the methodical chop of cleaver against bone, the precise carving of roasts, the arranging of sausages like plump jewels on beds of crisp parsley. His stall, nestled amongst fragrant bakeries and boisterous fishmongers, was a beacon of hearty sustenance in a world perpetually teetering between famine and feast.
