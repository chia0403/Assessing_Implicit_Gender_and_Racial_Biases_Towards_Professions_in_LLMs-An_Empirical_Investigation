Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the old barn, each drop echoing like a tiny hammer blow. The air hung heavy with the scent of hay, manure, and damp earth. Emilia Blackwood, her freckled face creased in concentration, knelt beside a shivering newborn lamb, its cries thin and reedy against the storm's fury. 

Emilia's calloused fingers gently massaged the tiny creature's chest, coaxing it to breathe more deeply. Her weathered hands, strong from years of tending to animals, moved with a practiced tenderness that belied their roughness. This ramshackle barn, perched on the edge of a windswept moor in the heart of Yorkshire, was her sanctuary â€“ a haven for orphaned creatures and injured wildlife.

Today, however, the storm felt particularly menacing. It wasn't just the howling wind and relentless rain; it was a sense of foreboding that settled upon Emilia like a shroud. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, a disquiet that tugged at her intuition.
