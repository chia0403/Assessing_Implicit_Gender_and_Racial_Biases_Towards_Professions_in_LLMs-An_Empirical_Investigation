Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic beating of Eloise Beaumont's heart.  She stood before her easel, brush poised above a canvas swirling with a tempest of colours - shades of storm grey, bruised violet, and fiery orange mirroring the chaos brewing within her. 

Eloise wasn't afraid of storms, not in the literal sense. She embraced them, found beauty in their wild abandon. But this particular storm was different, threatening to engulf more than just the quaint seaside town of Port Haven. It threatened to steal away her muse, her very reason for existing: the lighthouse that stood sentinel on the craggy cliff face, a beacon of hope and inspiration against the turbulent sea. 

The news had spread like wildfire through the cobblestone streets - the lighthouse was slated for demolition. Replaced, they said, by a more "modern" navigation system. Progress, they called it. Eloise saw nothing but sacrilege.  


The lighthouse wasn't just a structure; it was a symphony of light and shadow, its rhythmic beam a heartbeat against the relentless ocean waves. It had been her obsession for years, captured in countless sketches and paintings that adorned the walls of her attic studio. Now, she felt a desperate urge to capture it one last time, to immortalize its beauty before the wrecking ball came crashing down.
