Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Finch's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Clover Insurance" sign outside. The rhythmic drumming mirrored the steady thrumming in Elias's chest, a mixture of anxiety and caffeine jitters.  He chewed on his thumbnail, squinting at the file before him: "The Blackwood Estate - Claim #4721." A shiver ran down his spine. Blackwood Manor, perched precariously on Widow's Peak overlooking the storm-tossed sea, was notorious for its unsettling history. Elias had heard whispers of strange occurrences, unexplained deaths, and a lingering sense of dread that clung to the very stones of the place.  

This wasn't just another claim for fire damage or stolen jewelry. This was something else entirely, something that made Elias wish he'd chosen a career path lessâ€¦ spectral.
