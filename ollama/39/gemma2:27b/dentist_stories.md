She glanced at the clock, its hands ticking with relentless indifference. Four o'clock. Too early to leave.

Suddenly, a sharp rapping on the door jolted her from her contemplation. It wasn't the polite knock of a scheduled patient. This was urgent, insistent. Elara straightened her lab coat and walked towards the sound, her curiosity battling with a prickle of unease.
