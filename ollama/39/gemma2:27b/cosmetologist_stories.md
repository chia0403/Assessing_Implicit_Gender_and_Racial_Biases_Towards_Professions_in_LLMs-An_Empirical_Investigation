The neon sign flickered, casting a lurid green glow across Aurelia "Ari" Sanchez's face as she unlocked the salon door.  Dust motes danced in the sliver of moonlight slicing through the grime-coated window. The air inside was thick with the ghosts of yesterday's hairspray and the faint, sweet decay of forgotten flowers. Ari sighed, her breath a wispy cloud in the chill air.  

This wasn't how she pictured her life at 28. She'd dreamt of owning a bustling salon in the heart of Miami, filled with laughter and the intoxicating scent of exotic conditioners. Instead, she was stuck running "Shear Madness," a faded beauty parlor tucked away on a forgotten street in the city's outskirts. The clientele was sparse, mostly regulars clinging to their routines like lifelines. Still, Ari held onto hope. She believed that even in this dusty corner of the world, she could weave magic with her scissors and brushes, transforming lives one strand at a time.
