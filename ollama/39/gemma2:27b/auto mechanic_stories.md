The midday sun beat down on Jasper "Jazz" Callahan's grease-stained hands as he wrestled with a seized alternator.  Sweat beaded on his forehead, blurring the already chaotic tangle of wires under the hood of the rusty Ford pickup. 

Jazz's shop, "Callahan's Clunkers," sat tucked away on a dusty backroad just outside Harmony Creek, a town that hadn't seen much excitement since the general store swapped its rotary phone for a push-button model. The air hummed with cicadas and the distant whine of a lawnmower, a symphony familiar to Jazz's ears.

He grunted as the alternator finally loosened, sending a shower of rust flakes onto his worn overalls. "Stubborn beast," he muttered, wiping his brow with a rag stained blacker than the night sky. He was used to wrestling with temperamental machines; they were more predictable than people, in his experience.
