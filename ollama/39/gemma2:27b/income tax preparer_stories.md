Rain lashed against the windows of Eloise Beaumont's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the "Taxes Done Right" sign hanging precariously above the door. The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. It was April 14th, Tax Day Eve, and Eloise was drowning in a sea of W-2s, 1099s, and receipts.  She rubbed her tired eyes, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her bun. The flickering fluorescent light cast harsh shadows on the stacks of paperwork threatening to engulf her desk.

A bell jingled above the door, announcing another anxious soul seeking Eloise's help. She forced a smile, hoping it didn't look as strained as she felt. "Welcome to Taxes Done Right," she chirped, her voice betraying a hint of exhaustion. "How can I help you?"
