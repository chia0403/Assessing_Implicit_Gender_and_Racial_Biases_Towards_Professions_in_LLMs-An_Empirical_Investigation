Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the drafters' bullpen, blurring the city lights into an impressionistic smear. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and graphite, punctuated by the rhythmic whirring of plotters churning out blueprints. Amelia Winthrop hunched over her drafting table, a fortress of crumpled paper, plastic triangles, and chewed pencils surrounding her. A tangled mess of lines snaked across her vellum sheet - the skeletal outline of a futuristic skyscraper, destined to pierce the very clouds Amelia could barely see through the downpour. 

A low groan escaped her lips as she realized the proportions were off again. Frustration gnawed at her. This project, the Zenith Tower, was supposed to be her big break, a chance to prove herself amongst the grizzled veterans of the firm. But so far, it felt like nothing more than an endless string of revisions and setbacks.

Suddenly, a sharp clap echoed through the bullpen, silencing the rhythmic clatter of pencils. Mr. Hawthorne, Amelia's perpetually grumpy supervisor, loomed over her table, his bushy eyebrows knitted together in a scowl. 


"Winthrop," he barked, "What's the holdup? Deadline's looming."
