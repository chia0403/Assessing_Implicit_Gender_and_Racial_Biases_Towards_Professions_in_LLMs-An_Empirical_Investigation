The rain hammered against the iron-wrought gates of Castle Eldoria, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of silver on the cobblestones below. A gust ripped through the courtyard, snatching Bartholomew Blackwood's cloak from his shoulders and sending it swirling across the flagstones. He cursed, spitting out rainwater that had caught in his beard, before wrestling with the heavy lock securing the main gate.

Bartholomew wasn't a man born for comfort. His weathered face spoke of long hours under harsh sun and relentless wind, his calloused hands were more at home gripping a sword hilt than a goblet. He'd been guarding Castle Eldoria for twenty years â€“ ever since he was a young man, fresh from the war and seeking solace in solitude. The castle's imposing walls, shrouded in mist and ancient secrets, had become Bartholomew's sanctuary. 

But tonight, even the familiar weight of his responsibilities felt heavier. A strange unease gnawed at him, stirred by the relentless storm and the unsettling silence within the castle itself. Usually, flickering lamplight would spill from the windows, accompanied by the distant strains of music or laughter. But tonight, Eldoria seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something unknown to unfold.
