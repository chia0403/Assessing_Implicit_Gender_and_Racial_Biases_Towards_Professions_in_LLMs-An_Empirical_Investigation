The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows, casting long shadows across the alphabet rug and the mismatched collection of desks she'd inherited from decades past. A faint scent of crayons and old glue lingered in the air â€“ a comforting aroma Beatrice associated with childhood innocence and boundless imagination.

But lately, a shadow had fallen over Oakhaven, dimming the usual vibrant energy. Something wasn't right, and Beatrice was determined to find out what it was.
