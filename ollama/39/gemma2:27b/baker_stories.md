The aroma of caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the yeasty scent of rising dough and the faint tang of cinnamon. Amelia Roseweather surveyed her domain â€“ "Amelia's Sweet Surrender," a cozy bakery tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Willow Creek. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating shelves piled high with glistening croissants, jewel-toned macarons, and loaves of bread still warm from the oven.  

Despite the idyllic scene, Amelia felt a knot of anxiety tighten in her chest. Today was the annual Willow Creek Bake-Off, and her sourdough starter, lovingly named "Gertrude," had decided to stage a rebellion. Instead of its usual bubbly exuberance, Gertrude remained stubbornly flat, threatening to sabotage Amelia's chances at winning the coveted Golden Whisk trophy for the third year running.  

As Amelia kneaded the sluggish dough, she couldn't help but wonder what was wrong with Gertrude. Was it the change in weather? The new batch of flour? Or something more sinister lurking beneath the surface of her sourdough starter?
