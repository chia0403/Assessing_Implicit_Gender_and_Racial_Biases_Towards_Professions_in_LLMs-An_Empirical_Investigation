The sun beat down on Elias Clayborne's weathered neck as he surveyed his domain. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, kicking up red clouds that seemed to mock the dry creek bed snaking through his property. His calloused hands tightened on the reins of his chestnut mare, Belle. The once-lush pastures were now brittle and brown, a testament to the unrelenting drought gripping their corner of Montana. Elias squinted towards the distant horizon, hoping against hope for a sign of rain. But the sky remained a relentless blue, as empty and unforgiving as his cattle's bellies. 

For generations, the Clayborne family had wrangled this land, riding out floods, blizzards, and rustlers. This drought, however, felt different, a slow, creeping death threatening to consume everything Elias held dear. He needed rain, and he needed it soon.
