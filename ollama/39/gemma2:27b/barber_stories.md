The bell above the door jingled merrily, announcing Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' first customer of the day. Bart sighed, smoothing down his apron and glancing at the clock: 8:02 am sharp. Mrs. Peabody, always punctual. He liked that about her.

His shop, "Higgins' Haircut Haven," wasn't much to look at â€“ a narrow storefront sandwiched between a laundromat perpetually smelling of stale soap and a dimly lit pawn shop rumored to sell stolen goods. But inside, it was warm and inviting. Walls the color of worn leather were adorned with framed black-and-white photos of classic hairstyles: pompadours from the fifties, slicked-back styles from the sixties, and feathered mullets that Bart swore never went out of style.

The scent of bay rum and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma Bart had meticulously cultivated over his twenty years as a barber. Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the cracked pavement of Elm Street, but inside Higgins' Haircut Haven, time seemed to slow down. It was a haven, indeed, from the hustle and bustle of everyday life, where men could relax, confide, and leave feeling like a million bucks. 

Bart smiled at Mrs. Peabody as she settled into his worn leather barber chair, her silver hair pulled back in a neat bun. "Morning, Millie. The usual?"
