Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the Chinatown alley below. Eleanor "Ellie" Chen tapped her pen impatiently against the notepad, the rhythmic click the only sound competing with the relentless downpour. The air in the cramped apartment was thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and instant noodles, a testament to Ellie's late nights chasing leads for the Chinatown Chronicle. Tonight's story: the disappearance of Old Man Wong, a revered herbalist who vanished without a trace three days ago. 

The police had written it off as another case of an elderly man wandering away, but Ellie knew better. There was something unsettling about the quiet desperation etched on the faces of Wong's family and the hushed whispers circulating amongst Chinatown's residents. Something smelled rotten, and Ellie, with her nose for trouble and unwavering belief in justice, was determined to sniff it out.
