The air in Amelia Beatrice Winthrop's tiny office was thick with the scent of old paper and lukewarm coffee. A perpetual haze of cigarette smoke hung just beneath the ceiling, a testament to her late-night editing sessions fueled by caffeine and nicotine. Outside, New York City throbbed with its usual frenetic energy, but here in Amelia's cramped sanctuary, nestled above a noisy bodega on the Lower East Side, time seemed to move at a different pace. 

Amelia tapped a red pen against the manuscript spread across her desk, her brow furrowed in concentration. The words blurred before her eyes, the writer's voice grating against her sensibilities like fingernails on a chalkboard. This wasn't the kind of raw talent Amelia typically sought out – she preferred stories with heart and soul, narratives that hummed with life and truth. This one, however, had landed on her desk courtesy of a persistent agent, promising untold potential. 


Amelia sighed, pushing back from her desk and reaching for another cigarette. Perhaps if she squinted hard enough, the potential would magically appear. But as she lit up, her gaze fell upon a faded photograph tucked beneath a stack of manuscripts. A younger Amelia, her face bright with optimism, stood beside a towering oak tree in a sun-drenched field. In that moment, she remembered why she became an editor – to unearth hidden gems, to polish rough stones into brilliant diamonds, to help writers find their voice and share it with the world.

Maybe this manuscript wasn't so hopeless after all.  Amelia took a long drag, the smoke swirling around her head like a halo of doubt.
