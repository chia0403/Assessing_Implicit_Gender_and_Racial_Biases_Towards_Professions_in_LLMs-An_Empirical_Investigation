Rain hammered against the bus stop shelter, a relentless assault echoing Elara Ainsworth's pounding headache. The neon sign above flickered weakly, casting her face in alternating shades of sickly green and bruised purple. She tugged her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself, wishing she hadn't skimped on coffee this morning. A double shift at the Mercy General Hospital blood bank awaited, and Elara knew caffeine would be her only solace amidst the endless tide of donors.

Elara wasn't thrilled about her job. The constant pricking, the occasional fainting spell, the weary faces - it all felt monotonous and draining. But with mounting student loan debt looming over her like a storm cloud, she needed the steady paycheck. Besides, there was something oddly satisfying about transforming fear into calm with a practiced smile and a gentle touch.  


She longed for something more. A chance to use her biology degree for something beyond drawing blood. Something that didn't involve fluorescent lights and antiseptic smells. But for now, Elara Ainsworth was just another cog in the Mercy General machine, waiting for her bus to arrive and usher her into another day of veins and vials.
