The fluorescent lights buzzed above Dr. Eleanor Vance's head, casting an unforgiving glare across the stainless steel instruments laid out on her tray. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, catching the light before disappearing into the unruly curls escaping her surgical cap. The air in the operating room hung heavy with the metallic scent of blood and antiseptic. Outside, a storm raged, mirroring the tumult in Eleanor's chest.

It wasn't the complexity of the procedure – a triple bypass on a seventy-year-old man with a history of heart problems – but the patient himself: her estranged father, Henry Vance. He lay unconscious on the operating table, his chest rising and falling in shallow breaths, the stark reality of their fractured relationship laid bare under the unforgiving OR lights. 


Eleanor had always been driven by logic, by precision. But tonight, emotions threatened to cloud her judgment, her scalpel trembling slightly as she picked it up. Could she separate the surgeon from the daughter? Could she save the man who had barely acknowledged her existence for most of her life?
