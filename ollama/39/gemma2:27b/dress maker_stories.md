The air in Estelle Evangeline Dubois' workshop hummed with the quiet industry of her sewing machine. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, catching the iridescent threads spilling from spools like spilled rainbows. Outside, Paris bustled with the cacophony of early morning, but within Estelle's haven, all was calm save for the rhythmic whirring of the needle and the gentle rustling of silks.

Estelle herself was a vision in contrasts: her hands, roughened by years of manipulating needles and fabric, delicately adjusted a lace collar on a gown of the palest lavender. Her face, etched with the wisdom of countless fittings and alterations, held a youthful sparkle as she contemplated the final touches needed to transform this simple garment into something breathtaking. Today was no ordinary day. The Duchess de Valois herself was due for a fitting, and Estelle's reputation, already whispered among Paris' elite, hung delicately in the balance.
