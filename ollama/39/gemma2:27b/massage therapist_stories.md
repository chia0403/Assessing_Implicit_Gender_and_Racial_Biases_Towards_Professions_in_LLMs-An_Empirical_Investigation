Rain lashed against the frosted glass windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously above the door. Inside, Eliza Rosewick knelt beside the worn massage table, smoothing out the crisp linen sheets with practiced hands. The scent of lavender and chamomile hung in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the storm raging outside.  Eliza wasn't fazed by the weather. She thrived on these quiet evenings, when the hustle of the city seemed to melt away, leaving only her and the soothing rhythm of muscle and bone beneath her fingertips. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Eliza's skin as she waited for her last client of the night.  

The bell above the door jingled, echoing through the small, dimly lit space, and a tall figure stepped inside, silhouetted against the storm-tossed street.
