The midday sun beat down on Elias Bartholomew Finnigan III's already sweat-slicked forehead as he gestured towards the crumbling archway. "And here," he announced, his voice booming over the excited chatter of his tour group, "stands the last remnant of the once magnificent Hadrian's Gate, a testament to the Roman Empire's enduring influence on this ancient city."

Elias adjusted the fedora perched precariously on his head and surveyed his audience. A motley crew of tourists, they were: a young couple giggling over a shared selfie stick, an elderly woman diligently scribbling notes in a leather-bound journal, and a group of boisterous teenagers more interested in their phones than the history unfolding before them.

But Elias, with his unwavering enthusiasm and encyclopedic knowledge of Ephesus, was determined to ignite a spark of wonder in each one of them. This wasn't just a job for him; it was a calling. He felt a deep connection to these ancient stones, imagining the lives lived, the stories whispered, the empires risen and fallen within this very space.

Today, however, something felt different. As Elias delved into the history of the gate, his gaze snagged on a flicker of movement in the shadows beyond the archway. A flash of emerald green disappeared behind a crumbling pillar, leaving him with a prickling sensation at the back of his neck. He dismissed it as a stray cat, but the image lingered in his mind, casting an unsettling shadow over the familiar stories he was telling.
