Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Vance's cramped office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across stacks of college brochures and motivational posters featuring grinning teenagers holding oversized diplomas. Outside, the usually bustling hallways of Northgate High were eerily silent. It was a Friday afternoon, but Ms. Vance hadn't felt this heavy in years.  

The recent string of suicides in the town had shaken everyone to their core. As Northgate's guidance counselor for the past decade, Eleanor felt personally responsible. She prided herself on building connections with her students, creating a safe space for them to share their struggles. Yet, it seemed she'd failed to see the pain lurking beneath the surface in some. The latest victim, Jason Miller, a quiet but bright junior, had been struggling with his grades and social isolation. Eleanor remembered him coming into her office just last week, his eyes downcast, asking for help with college applications. She'd offered the usual advice – study groups, extracurriculars – but she hadn't delved deeper. Now, Jason was gone, leaving behind a void that echoed through the hallways of Northgate High.  

Eleanor stared out the window at the rain-soaked football field, remembering Jason's shy smile as he hesitantly joined the soccer team last spring. He had been hopeful then, eager to find his place among his peers. The thought sent a pang of guilt through her. What if she had pushed harder? What if she had seen past the surface and truly understood his pain?

The office phone buzzed, jolting her back to reality. It was Principal Thompson, his voice grave. "Eleanor," he said, "we have another situation."
