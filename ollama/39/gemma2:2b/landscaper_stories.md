##  The Whispering Hedges

**Setting:** A sprawling estate nestled amongst the rolling hills of rural Vermont, where time seemed to move differently, measured by the seasons' slow dance. The grand house, its facade a weathered symphony of greystone and ivy, stood sentinel over a meticulously kept garden. 

**Main Character:**  Ethan Thorne, known as "Ebby" by his friends who found his gruff demeanor softened by his passion for shaping the earth. At 35, Ethan was a solitary man, haunted by the ghosts of a family legacy he never quite fit into.  He walked through life in well-worn boots, his hands calloused and strong from years spent coaxing beauty out of stubborn soil. His days were filled with mowing emerald lawns, pruning overgrown rose bushes, and tending to the whispering hedges that gave his clients' gardens their gentle allure â€“ but each day felt as much about escaping his own melancholic landscape as it did about creating one for others. 

**Story Opening:** The early morning air hung heavy with dew and the promise of rain, clinging to Ethan like a reluctant friend. He surveyed the manicured lawns of Mrs. Henderson's estate - her prized hydrangeas were already bursting forth in vibrant pink and purple hues, each bloom a testament to his meticulous care.  But today, something felt different. A subtle shift in the wind carrying an unfamiliar scent, almost metallic, caught Ethan's attention. He paused at the base of the whispering hedges, their rustling leaves now eerily silent. "Don't you start," he muttered to the wind, though a nagging feeling settled in his gut like a stone. Something was amiss, and it wasn't just the scent of rain on earth.
