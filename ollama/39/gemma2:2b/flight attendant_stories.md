## Setting:

The steel-and-glass belly of American Airlines Flight 347 hummed with a silent energy, its passengers in their various states of pre-flight anticipation.  The sun, a fiery orange disc sinking towards the horizon, painted long, dramatic shadows across the cabin as Amelia "Amy" Taylor adjusted her polished uniform and checked her watch for the fifth time.

**Amelia "Amy" Taylor**, with her cascading auburn hair neatly tucked behind her ear and a smile that seemed to radiate warmth even in the harsh fluorescent lights of the galley, was known throughout her crew for her calm demeanor and ability to diffuse any pre-flight jitters. 

### Story Opening: 

The captain's voice crackled over the intercom, a dry, practiced tone devoid of emotion.  "Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for takeoff." Amy watched as a ripple of nervous laughter broke out from the front rows. She knew these anxieties well; every flight was an adventure in its own right, each passenger with their own story waiting to unfold during a journey across the sky. 

But something felt different tonight.  A tension hung heavy in the air, a palpable shift in the usual pre-flight hum that resonated with Amy's gut.  She couldn't quite put her finger on it â€“ a lingering unease, perhaps?  Or was there something more ominous lurking beneath the surface of this ordinary flight? 


**Amy took a deep breath and looked out the window.** The runway stretched before them, an endless ribbon of concrete against the fading twilight sky.   The setting sun cast long shadows across the tarmac, each one mirroring the unsettling feeling in her heart.
