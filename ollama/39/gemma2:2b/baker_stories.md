The air hung thick with sugar dust and cinnamon swirls, the scent both familiar and comforting to Elara Blackwood. Her tiny bakery, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the shadow of the imposing Clock Tower, was her sanctuary, her world. The walls were lined with hand-painted tiles depicting whimsical scenes of nature – blooming sunflowers and cascading waterfalls - each one chipped and faded but imbued with the years of warmth she’d poured into them. 

Elara's days were a rhythm as predictable as the rising and falling tide, measured out in flour sacks and oven timers. She began her morning kneading dough before the sun even dared peek over the rooftops, then carefully crafted each loaf, whispering little prayers for each one to be perfect.  Each day, she brought life to her pastries with an artistic flair – heart-shaped scones filled with apricot jam, delicate sugar-flower cakes spun from lavender and lemon, golden croissants that held a promise of warmth. 
 
But tonight, something felt different. A storm was brewing on the horizon, its shadows stretching across the sky like hungry cats. Elara, her apron dusted with flour, stood at her window, watching the first heavy drops fall, each one sounding a mournful echo of the whispers in the wind that promised more. Tonight's delivery was unusually large, and tonight, fate seemed to hold something sinister for Elara Blackwood.
