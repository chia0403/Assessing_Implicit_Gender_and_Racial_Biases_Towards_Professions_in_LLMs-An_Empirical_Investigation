## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Vance's small clinic nestled amongst towering oaks in Maple Creek. The air inside was thick with the scent of disinfectant and anxiety. Amelia, her long auburn braid bouncing as she moved between examining tables, sighed heavily. 

The last hour had been a whirlwind. First came Mrs. Odette’s worried schnauzer, Sparky, whose limp was as sudden as it was inexplicable. Then, young Toby's boisterous labrador mix, Bruno, who'd swallowed his owner's prized antique pocket watch while chasing after a frisbee in the park. Now, there was Billy, a stoic bull mastiff with labored breathing and an obvious refusal to move. 

Amelia ran her hands through her hair, frustration simmering just beneath the surface of her usual calm demeanor.  The clinic had been unusually busy lately; perhaps it was the change in season, or maybe it was the growing unease settling over Maple Creek like a damp fog. The truth was, she couldn't quite put her finger on why, but something felt…off.
