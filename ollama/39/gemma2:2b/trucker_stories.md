The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel and dust as Reginald "Reg" Butterfield steered his rig through the desolate plains of Wyoming. The sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Route 87, baking the windshield until it shimmered like a mirage. Reg squinted, his leathery face etched with lines from years spent under the open sky.  

His trusty eighteen-wheeler, affectionately nicknamed "Old Betsy," rumbled along beside him, its chrome gleaming beneath the midday sun.  Reg had driven her for fifteen years, carrying everything from steel beams to furniture across the vast American landscape. He knew every curve of this lonely road like the back of his hand, every mile a familiar friend. 

But today was different. The usual calm that came with endless stretches of asphalt was missing. A tightness gripped Reg's chest, a feeling he couldn't quite name, a sense of wrongness like a whisper on the wind. He flicked on the radio – only static greeted him.  It wasn’t just the silence; there was a creeping unease in the air that made his scalp tingle. 

Reg took a deep breath, the dry Wyoming air filling his lungs.  “Gotta find a place to stop,” he muttered, pushing onward towards a lone gas station sign on the horizon. “I need to stretch my legs and clear my head.”
