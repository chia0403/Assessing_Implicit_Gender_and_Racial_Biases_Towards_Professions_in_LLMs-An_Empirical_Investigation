The midday sun beat down on Daniel "Hawk" Holloway's back as he shifted his weight from one foot to the other. He squinted at the seemingly endless stretch of asphalt before him â€“ a ribbon of grey slicing through the heart of Wyoming, where even the wind seemed to hum with exhaustion. The air was thick with heat and dust, clinging to Hawk like an unwelcome second skin.  He wiped his forehead, leaving behind streaks of sweat in the shimmering glare of the sun. It had been another scorching day on the highway, and the endless line of orange cones marking construction zones stretched as far as the eye could see. 

This was where Hawk belonged, he thought, feeling a familiar calm settle over him as he adjusted his hardhat. His calloused hands were used to wielding tools, not words, but today felt different. The usual quiet hum of routine had been replaced by an unexpected tension in the air. The foreman's voice echoed from behind him, booming across the desolate landscape: "Hawk, we got a problem." Hawk sighed deeply and pulled off his dusty gloves.  The silence that followed was thick with anticipation, like a storm about to break.
