Rain pattered against the dusty windowpane of Flora's Flowers, blurring the vibrant reds and purples of her beloved begonias. Inside, the air hung thick with the heady scent of roses and lilies, their fragrance competing for dominance with the sharp tang of petrichor that clung to the storm-battered exterior. The wind, a restless spirit howling through the eaves, rattled the old windows like skeletal fingers tapping on glass.  Flora, her hands callused and stained with ink from countless floral arrangements, adjusted a drooping hydrangea in its vase. 

Her name was Flora Bloom, and she'd inherited the shop from her grandmother. It wasn't just a business; it was an extension of herself, a living canvas where life's fleeting beauty found solace within the delicate petals and sturdy stems. But today, even the blooms seemed to lack their usual vibrance. A melancholic song played in the background, the same tune she'd composed for her grandmother on her deathbed, a melody that echoed with unspoken grief as the rain continued its relentless assault. 


What was Flora going to do?
