## Story Opening:

The air hung thick with the aroma of brine and sawdust as Elias "Big Ed" Thorne ran his callused hands over the slab of venison he'd been carving for hours. The morning light slanted through the window of his shop, illuminating dust motes dancing in its beams. Big Ed was alone – a fact that only served to amplify the symphony of sounds that accompanied his work: the sharp thwack of the cleaver against meat, the rhythmic rasping of sandpaper on worn wood, and the low hum of the refrigerator behind him holding countless months’ worth of cured ham and bacon. Outside, the town of Willow Creek hummed with life – children playing tag in the cobblestone square, a farmer's cart overflowing with peaches ladenly rolling down Main Street, a dog barking its way into a nearby yard, but for Big Ed, time seemed to slow its frantic pace within the confines of his shop. 

He glanced at the clock on the wall: just past eight. The town was about to wake up. 


## Setting:

**Big Ed's Butcher Shop:** Willow Creek, small town in the American Midwest.  The shop is a well-worn haven for local farmers and families alike. Its interior is filled with wooden counters and shelves laden with various meats – fresh cuts of pork, beef, poultry, and even cured hams – all displayed in rows that seem both familiar and comforting to Big Ed's regular customers. His hands know each piece as well as he knows his own face; each cut, each piece has a story, a tale of life on the farm or from market days long gone by. 
 
The shop sits at the heart of Willow Creek – right next door to the town’s only bakery, and down the road from the general store where folks go for essentials. The scent of wood smoke hangs heavy in the air even though it's early morning, a subtle reminder of Big Ed's trade and the family life he built within these walls. He runs his own establishment with quiet efficiency, respecting tradition while also looking ahead – preparing not just meat for his customers but offering them a glimpse into their past and a taste of the future.
