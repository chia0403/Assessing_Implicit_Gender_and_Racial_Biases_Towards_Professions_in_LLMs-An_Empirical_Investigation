The scent of lavender oil clung to the air, a calming fragrance that did little to soothe the simmering anger in Evelyn "Eve" Hawthorne's stomach. She stood behind the velvet curtain separating her treatment room from the waiting area, staring at the overflowing inbox on her laptop. Each notification was another reminder – an angry email, a demanding note, even a call from a disgruntled client whose ankle had refused to cooperate during yesterday’s session.  The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple as Eve sighed, pushing back strands of auburn hair that seemed determined to escape her braid. 

**Setting:** A cozy, secluded spa nestled amidst the rolling hills of Vermont. The air was crisp with the promise of autumn, and a gentle breeze carried the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  The interior, though rustic, boasted plush carpets, soft lighting, and calming, earthy tones. 


**Main Character:** Evelyn "Eve" Hawthorne - A skilled massage therapist with a heart of gold and an almost uncanny ability to make even the most tense muscles relax. Eve's life was dedicated to her clients’ well-being, but she couldn't shake the growing sense of unease that something wasn’t quite right. There were whispers in the town, murmurs about strange occurrences around the spa, and lately, Eve herself had felt a creeping disconnect from her usual calm demeanor.
