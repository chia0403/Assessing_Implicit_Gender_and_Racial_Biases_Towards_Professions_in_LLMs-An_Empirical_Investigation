The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt sugar and unspoken grievances as Agnes Thistlewick navigated the cluttered hallways of Blackwood Manor. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight filtering through the stained-glass window depicting some long-forgotten knight. A sigh escaped her lips, not from exhaustion but from the weight of secrets that seemed to cling to this grand yet decaying home like cobwebs. 

Agnes Thistlewick was the quiet keeper of Blackwood's dust and its lingering memories. For twenty years, she’d been the unseen hand behind the manor's polished facade, scrubbing grime off walls and polishing silver in the dead silence punctuated by the ticking of a grandfather clock.  Her days were measured out by the rhythm of cleaning: dusting, vacuuming, ironing - each task a small victory in the face of the manor's grand but crumbling grandeur.  But something was brewing beneath the surface, a subtle shift in Agnes’ usual order of life that threatened to shatter her quiet routine. The air itself felt thick with an unspoken tension – the kind that came when ghosts whispered through empty rooms.
