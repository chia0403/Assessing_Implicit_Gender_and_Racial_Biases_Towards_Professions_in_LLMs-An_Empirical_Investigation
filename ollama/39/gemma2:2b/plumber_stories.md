## The Rust-Eaters 

**Setting:** A cramped, rain-slicked alley behind a forgotten five-and-dime shop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Neon signs flicker erratically above crumbling brick facades, casting long, grotesque shadows on the damp concrete floor.  The air hangs heavy with the scent of decaying leaves and diesel exhaust, punctuated by the sharp tang of rust.

**Main Character:** Bartholomew "Barty" Fitzwilliam is a man as rough around the edges as the rusted pipes he tends to repair. His calloused hands, scarred from years of wrestling stubborn plumbing fixtures, hold his wrench like an extension of himself. He's got a thick beard that blends in with the grime and a face etched with worry lines deeper than any sewer line he tackles.  

**Opening:** Barty squinted into the gloom as rain battered down on the corrugated metal roof overhead. A sigh escaped his lips, mingling with the relentless drumming of rain against the tin. The last job was done for another week, but tonight he felt a gnawing unease. He wasnâ€™t sure why. Just something didn't feel right, like the usual symphony of plumbing groans and taps had been replaced by an unsettling, discordant silence. Tonight, even the rusty pipes seemed to whisper secrets in his ear.

Barty lifted his battered wrench, its worn metal handle feeling familiar against his weathered palm. It was a routine night; a leaky faucet here, a clogged drain there, until his stomach settled with the satisfaction of solving the plumbing puzzles that were life's minor catastrophes. 


But tonight felt different. Something was amiss.
