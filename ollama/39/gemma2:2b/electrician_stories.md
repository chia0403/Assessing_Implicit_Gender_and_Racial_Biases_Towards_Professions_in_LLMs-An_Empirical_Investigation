## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:** A bustling, vibrant city at night. Neon signs paint the sky in kaleidoscopic hues, casting long shadows on the slick concrete streets. The air hums with a constant symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and the rhythmic pulse of life in this urban jungle. 

**Character:**  Ethan Blackwood, a man with calloused hands and eyes that reflected the harsh glow of his work lamps, stood on the fire escape of an old Victorian building. He was everything he wasn't: sharp and meticulous - yet his clothes were worn, his brow perpetually furrowed in thought. As the city slept beneath him, Ethan felt most alive.  His trusty toolkit lay open beside him, a testament to the quiet power his hands possessed. 

**Opening:** 
"Another busted breaker panel," Ethan muttered under his breath, tracing the outline of a circuit diagram etched into the wall behind him with calloused fingers. The flickering neon light cast a ghostly glow on his weathered face as he pondered the complex web of wires before him. A groan emanated from the rusted metal of the old buildingâ€™s frame - an unwelcome soundtrack to Ethan's silent struggle with the city's chaotic electricity. "Guess tonight, the lights are going out for a few." 
He pulled out his voltmeter, tapping it against his worn toolbox like a drum, and began the methodical dance of troubleshooting. He could feel the weight of another restless night ahead - the kind that always seemed to pull him into its shadowy embrace.  His mind whirred with the intricate calculations of electrical circuits, each flicker a puzzle he couldn't resist solving.
