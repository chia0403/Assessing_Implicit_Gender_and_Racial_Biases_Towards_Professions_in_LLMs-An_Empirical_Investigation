The desert wind whipped at Amelia "Amy" Walker's weathered face as she stared out from atop the enormous bulldozerâ€™s cab.  Sandstorms swirled across the desolate expanse of Nevada, turning the horizon into a swirling canvas of orange and brown.  The air throbbed with the low hum of machinery, punctuated by the occasional screech of brakes or the roar of the diesel engine as Amy steered the behemoth.  She was alone in the world except for the ever-present rumble of the machine and her thoughts - heavy thoughts about a job that felt both monumental and meaningless. 

The sun beat down on the rig, turning its metal surface into a burning furnace within seconds. This wasn't your typical construction site; this was the edge of civilization, where miles of barren land met the unforgiving expanse of the Nevada desert.  A skeleton crew - mostly men who looked like they belonged in a film noir with their worn leather jackets and tired eyes - worked around Amy. Her foreman, Gus, a mountain of a man who could crush a steel beam with one hand, walked towards her, his face etched with concern. 

"Amy," he rumbled, his voice thick with dust.  "We've got another transmission problem."
