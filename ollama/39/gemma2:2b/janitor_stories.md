## Setting: The Dusty Cathedral of St. Bartholomew's

**Opening:**

Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of St. Bartholomew’s cathedral, casting dancing shadows on the worn tile floor. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of incense and regret, the last echoes of a Sunday service fading into silence as Father Bernard locked up for the night. His tired gaze swept over the vast space, lingering on the dusty altar where once-brilliant angels now appeared to be weeping silent tears. This place, a monument to faith and grandeur, was more often than not filled with dust and despair. 

**Main Character:** Bartholomew "Bart" Miller

At the age of 47, Bart had long traded the polished silver of his life as a priest for the grime and grit of being a cathedral janitor. It wasn't a career choice; it was a necessity born from a tragic family history, one that seemed to leave him trapped between the solemnity of this grand space and the chaos of the world he yearned to escape. 

He pushed his mop across the floorboards with practiced ease, each stroke brushing away years of memories: echoes of whispered prayers, fleeting moments of childlike awe during Sunday services, and a lingering sense of guilt for leaving the church. 


The storm outside mirrored the turmoil within Bart. He wasn't sure he even wanted to escape anymore. St. Bartholomew’s held him captive, not with chains or walls, but with its history - his family's history, intertwined with its every creak and groan.
