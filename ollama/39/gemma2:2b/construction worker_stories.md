The concrete was still fresh-baked and vibrantly grey beneath Finn "Brick" O'Malley's boots.  It shimmered under the relentless July sun in the heart of the Oklahoma plains, baking the air thick and stagnant.  He squinted at the towering steel structure rising from the earth like a monstrous, skeletal titan – the project his whole crew was dedicating itself to, the one that would literally change this godforsaken town for generations to come. Brick's calloused hands gripped a freshly-repaired section of scaffolding as he surveyed the construction site. 

It wasn't much, just another speck in the vast expanse of the American Southwest.  But for Finn "Brick" O'Malley, it was home. His family had been a part of this town for generations, their roots sunk deep into the very foundation of the city - and now Brick was working to continue that legacy. The wind carried with it the distant rumble of an approaching thunderstorm, a threat as tangible as the heat radiating off the concrete.  He felt the weight of expectations on his shoulders – both from the foreman, Mr. Thompson, who had set his sights on seeing this project completed before the next harvest season, and from the ghosts of generations past that seemed to whisper their anxieties through the wind.
