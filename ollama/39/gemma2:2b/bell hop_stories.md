## Setting the Scene: The Grand Majestic Hotel 

The Grand Majestic Hotel stood like an opulent monument to excess in the heart of San Francisco's bustling Financial District. It was a labyrinth of mirrored halls, mahogany-paneled elevators, and glittering chandeliers that cast dancing shadows across every polished surface.  Every room boasted its own view – sprawling cityscapes to dramatic sunsets on the Golden Gate - but it was the air itself, thick with old money, whispered secrets, and the faint tang of expensive cigars, that truly defined the Grand Majestic's aura.

The year was 1928, Prohibition had brought a wave of hushed speakeasies to the city, and the hotel served as a meeting ground for ambitious businessmen, glamorous socialites, and countless other denizens of the high-society world.  It was here that young Edgar Bellweather worked, his youthful face barely visible beneath a fedora that hid a mind brimming with dreams far grander than the routine he lived in each day.

Edgar, known to most as "Ed" or even affectionately by guests as “The Whisper,” served as a bell hop. He had been working at the Grand Majestic since he was sixteen, ever since his family's modest laundromat fell on hard times.  He felt like an invisible man amongst the grand tapestry of society, yet he carried an internal fire that yearned for something more. 


## Story Opening

The crisp morning air stung Edgar’s cheeks as he finished tying the last of Mrs. Winthrop's floral arrangements into place. She had been a frequent guest in room 307, always arriving with her trademark chihuahua perched on her shoulder and an endless stream of gossip about local society figures. "You know how you can get," she often said to Ed after settling into the plush armchair at his discretion. “Sometimes, it's best not to let your nose lead the way."

Ed gave a small chuckle, tucking away the last of her floral arrangements in a neat stack. The air still held the scent of lilies and lavender, mingled with the faint echo of laughter and champagne from the hotel’s rooftop lounge where the guests were enjoying pre-dinner cocktails.  A familiar feeling washed over him as he walked past the grand elevator doors. This was his world - the world of hushed conversations, expensive perfume, and the thrill of getting to be a part of it all, even if it only happened in this quiet corner of the Grand Majestic’s expansive world.

The day's schedule had begun with a symphony of bells, each one announcing a new arrival or departure from the hotel.  As Edgar went about his duties, however, he couldn't help but notice the unusual silence that followed Mrs. Winthrop’s exit. He looked around. The usual hum and chatter seemed muted, as if everyone was waiting for something. 

A deep sense of unease crept over him.  He felt a shift in the air - an undercurrent of anticipation that he couldn't quite place. A feeling like the Grand Majestic itself was holding its breath.
