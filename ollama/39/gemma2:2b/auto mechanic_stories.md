The greasy air hung heavy in the shop, thick with the scent of oil, burnt metal, and forgotten dreams. Dust motes danced in the weak beams of the overhead lights as Edgar Thornton, owner and sole operator of "Thornton's Torque", ran his hands over the engine block of a battered 1968 Mustang. Its cherry-red paint was chipped and scratched, its chrome dull from years of neglect. It was a beast that had seen more battles than it could possibly remember, and now, Edgar had to bring it back to life. 

The year was 2047, and the city's old soul was being devoured by technological marvels. Hover cars zoomed through traffic, automated robots replaced most manual labor, and even streetlights hummed with a soft, green glow powered by nanobots. Yet, in this concrete jungle, Edgarâ€™s garage remained a bastion of a bygone era.  He took pride in the clangs and whirrs of his tools, in the smell of burning fuel and fresh grease. 

Edgar was no tech wizard. He understood cars like he understood his own heartbeat - instinctively, intuitively. The world moved too fast for him sometimes, leaving him longing for a slower pace, for the familiar rhythm of work that kept him grounded.  As he tightened a bolt, Edgar could almost hear his grandfather's voice whispering encouragement in his ear: "It ain't about the shiny gadgets, boy. It's about knowing the heart of the machine."
