The desert wind howled like a banshee across the rolling plains of Dust Devil Ranch, whipping dust into miniature tornadoes that danced erratically around Jebediah 'Jeb' Cartwright's weathered boots. He stood at his favorite vantage point: the old windmill, its rusty blades creaking in the relentless wind. Years of toil had etched lines deep into Jeb's face, like a map of the harsh land he called home. His eyes, though faded with age, still held a stubborn glint, reflecting the steely determination that had kept him afloat during countless blizzards and scorching droughts. The air hung thick with the scent of parched earth and burnt sagebrush, a familiar aroma Jeb couldn't shake off, even after decades of battling the unforgiving plains. It was a smell that clung to his soul, as much a part of him as the calluses on his hands or the weathered leather of his boots. Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced at the edge of Jeb's consciousness, amplified by the eerie silence that had settled over Dust Devil Ranch like a shroud.
