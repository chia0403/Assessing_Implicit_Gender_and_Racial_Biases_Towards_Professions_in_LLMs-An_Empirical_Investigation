The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and acetone. It was one of those rare days in New York City where the humidity didn't seem to cling like an unwanted guest, but rather danced lightly on the breeze that swirled around Elena's nail salon. The setting sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor, painting streaks of orange and pink against the chipped paint on the walls.

For years, she had found solace in this little corner of Manhattan, surrounded by the soft clinking of metal against glass and the rhythmic tapping of nail polish bottles.
