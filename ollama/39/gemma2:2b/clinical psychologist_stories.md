The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor "Elle" Sterling's office window, blurring the vibrant hues of the autumn foliage outside into abstract streaks of charcoal and gold.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of chamomile and sandalwood incense, two scents Elle used to attempt to soothe her own anxieties before each session began. But tonight, as she gazed at the swirling rain through the watery glass, she felt a familiar weight settle in her chest, heavy like leaden clouds themselves. 

Elle's late-night thoughts were not for the usual woes of her patients: divorce, grief, or the anxieties of raising teenagers. This night, her own demons were playing a macabre game.  She couldn't shake off the unsettling premonition that had been creeping in ever since she received a cryptic email from a former patient, a woman named Sophia Bell who had struggled with intrusive thoughts and obsessive tendencies years ago before their sessions ended abruptly. The last line of the email, "The past is never truly gone," echoed in her mind like a phantom whisper.  As Elle reached for her notepad, another wave of anxiety washed over her, making it hard to even write down the name that now seemed etched onto her soul: Sophia Bell. 
 
Elle was about to begin working on a case study that she knew would lead her into uncharted territory when the unexpected occurred. A phone call. The caller's voice, distorted by static and urgency, broke through the symphony of rain and her internal turmoil. It was from Sophiaâ€™s husband, asking for help.
