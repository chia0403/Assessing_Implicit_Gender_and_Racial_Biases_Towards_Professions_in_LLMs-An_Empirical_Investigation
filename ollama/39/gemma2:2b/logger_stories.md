##  Opening Paragraph 

Elias Thorne's calloused hands gripped the worn leather grip of his axe tighter, knuckles bone-white against the fading light. He’d been felling timber for longer than he could remember, each strike resonating with a familiar beat in the rhythm of his life –  the thwack of wood, the creak of the ancient trees, the wind whispering secrets through the pines. For years, Forks Cove had been his haven, a place where he could drown himself in the comforting chaos of the forest. Today, however, a knot of unease coiled tight in his gut as he surveyed the towering redwood before him, its massive trunk casting an ominous shadow over the clearing. He felt a presence, heavy and unsettling, like the weight of decades-old secrets whispering on the wind. Something was different this evening, something that sent a chill down his spine far beyond the approaching storm.
