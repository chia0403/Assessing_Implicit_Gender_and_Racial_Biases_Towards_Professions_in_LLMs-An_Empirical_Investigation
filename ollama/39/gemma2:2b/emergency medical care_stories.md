The late afternoon sun, already dipping below the horizon like a reluctant artist hiding its brush, cast long shadows across the asphalt of Central Avenue.  Rain pattered against the windows of Mercy's ambulance, rhythmically mimicking the frantic beat of her own heart. The name tag dangling from her neck was more than just a piece of metal; it felt like an accusation, a beacon that said "I am here to help," even as she battled the rising tide of doubt within. 

Her name wasn't merely Mercy; it was *Eleanor Mercy*, and tonight, unlike any other in her career, she was facing something personal â€“ the son of a former colleague, a boy with a broken leg who had been thrown from his bicycle during the rush hour chaos. Her mind was a whirlwind of memories:  her own childhood scrape, her mother's whispered stories of "the good old days" before the city became a labyrinth of concrete and metal; then, the chilling image of the boy's shattered arm, mirrored by the reflection of a flickering streetlight in the ambulance's rearview mirror. 

Eleanor took a deep breath and turned the ignition to the engine, starting the rhythmic hum that was both comfort and stress to her â€“ a soundtrack for an evening that had taken its first, sharp turn towards something profoundly personal.  She glanced at the boyâ€™s face, pale and still under the flickering streetlight. The boy's mother had been adamant about his treatment; no pain medication, just immediate care and then the hospital. But in her mind, Eleanor saw a world beyond charts and algorithms â€“ a world where she might actually be able to make a difference.
