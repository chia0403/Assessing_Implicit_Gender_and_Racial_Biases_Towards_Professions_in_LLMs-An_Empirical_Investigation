The air hung thick and heavy in the hushed library, smelling faintly of aged paper and dust motes dancing in the morning light filtering through the stained-glass window.  Evelyn Thorne, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously refiled a stack of dusty Victorian travel journals, couldn't help but feel a creeping sense of unease.  The silence was too absolute, too oppressive.

**Setting:** The story takes place in a small, independent library nestled within a charming, centuries-old city known for its Gothic architecture and hidden historical secrets. 

**Main Character:** Evelyn Thorne, a woman in her late 50s, with silvering hair neatly tucked under a worn librarian's cap, possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of local lore and a quiet intensity that hides a hidden talent for observation.  She has been the sole custodian of the library for over two decades, meticulously guarding its secrets and fostering a sense of wonder in her patrons.
