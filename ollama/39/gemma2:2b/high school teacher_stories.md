The humid air clung to Amelia Carter like a second skin, each breath carrying the sweet, cloying scent of honeysuckle and a hint of burnt rubber – the aroma of her own failing history classroom. She surveyed the chaos before her: spilled coffee cups, crumpled papers forming a haphazard landscape on Mrs. Higgins' desk, and the collective sighs of bored teenagers who, if she were honest, looked like they'd rather be anywhere else but here.  

Amelia wasn’t meant for this. At least, not in the way she had imagined her life would unfold. She'd dreamt of grand adventures – saving endangered species from poachers or unraveling ancient mysteries hidden in forgotten libraries. Now, at 27 with a Master's degree and a teaching certificate hanging on her wall, she was trapped in a world of standardized tests and classroom anxieties, battling boredom and the occasional teenage rebellion.

It was the last period before break, and Amelia could feel the weight of her own expectations pressing down. She’d started this year with a spring-loaded optimism that now felt as fragile as a dandelion puff caught in a breeze. This wasn't what she signed up for.
