The sky was bruised purple, mirroring the mood that had settled upon her heart. For weeks, whispers of discontent had been creeping through the city like a virus. Now, the air itself felt thick with tension, an unspoken anticipation for something dark and inevitable to unfold.

Her name was Elara Blackwood, and she wasn't just any guard; she was sworn protector of Ashwood Manor, tasked with maintaining order and protecting its wealthy inhabitants from the rising tide of unrest. But tonight, as shadows stretched long and twisted in the twilight, Elara felt a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. The air carried not only the chill of the approaching night, but also a palpable sense of dread that seemed to emanate from the very stones of the manor itself. 

The guardsmen at the gate were grim-faced, their eyes darting nervously between Elara and the silent procession entering the manor grounds â€“ an ominous line of figures draped in somber robes.  Each step they took echoed like a portent of doom, each word unspoken hanging heavy in the air.
