The air hung thick with the scent of wet granite and brine as Elara, her brow furrowed in concentration, surveyed the massive block.  She'd been working on this piece for weeks, painstakingly chipping away at the rough edges of the mountain-born stone. The quarry was a silent beast under the unforgiving sky, its slopes scarred with veins of iron ore and punctuated by jagged outcrops of granite like teeth bared against the blue expanse. Elara’s calloused hands, stained the color of sunset, worked deftly, her focus unwavering.  The sun had begun to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quarry floor. She was almost finished with this particular section, and then…

**Setting:** A sprawling quarry nestled in the heart of a windswept mountain range. The sky is eternally overcast, mirroring the ever-present storm clouds that gather above the stone like a brooding giant.  Granite outcroppings pierce the grey sky, forming the skeletal landscape of an ancient world swallowed by time.
