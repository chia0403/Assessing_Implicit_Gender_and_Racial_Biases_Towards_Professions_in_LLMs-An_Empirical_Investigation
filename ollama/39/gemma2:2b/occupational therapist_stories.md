## Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of The Willow Clinic, blurring the already gray city skyline into streaks of charcoal and washed-out blue. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and disinfectant, each breath a reminder of the fragility of human life. Eleanor Hayes, a seasoned occupational therapist with calloused hands and a heart worn like an old leather jacket, watched as her latest patient, a young man named Thomas, struggled to grasp a set of tweezers. His face was contorted in frustration, his eyes red-rimmed from exhaustion.

Thomas had been diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a cruel thief that stole his muscles and left him paralyzed inch by inch. Eleanor saw the quiet panic in his voice as he spoke, “I just want to make something myself again, even if it’s just…a picture frame.” 

The clinic's walls were lined with photos of patients past, each story a testament to resilience, but also a stark reminder of the ever-present struggle. As Thomas reached out, his hand trembled slightly before releasing the tweezers, Eleanor knew that this day was about more than crafting a simple frame. It was about relearning hope, a skill as fragile and valuable as any muscle he'd lost.
