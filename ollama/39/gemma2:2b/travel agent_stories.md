##  Setting: The Sunken City

A shimmering glass dome held a panorama of turquoise waters, dotted with emerald islands. Above, the air shimmered with heat trapped in an impossible twilight. Beneath the glistening surface, though, lay the ruins of Atlantis, its ancient buildings now submerged beneath swirling blue currents and luminescent seaweed. 

The "Atlantis Undersea Resort" was a recent marvel of sustainable tourism.  But not all visitors found it enchanting. **Amelia Everly**, with her perpetually-windblown turquoise hair and eyes that held the same depth as the ocean depths, stood in the doorway of her office - an intricately carved wooden door leading to what should have been a luxurious haven. Instead, she stared at the seafoam outside her window, swirling like a restless spirit.

The phone chimed, a shrill ring echoing through the quiet resort lobby. "Amelia?" it was Ms. Patel's voice, brittle and crackling over the line. 
"Yes, Mrs. Patel," Amelia replied, her tone matching the storm brewing within her. She knew what came next: another family lost at sea, another dream dashed in the unforgiving embrace of the ocean.  And as she looked out towards the endless blue, Amelia felt a familiar sense of unease. This was more than just a job; it was a lifeline to something long-forgotten.
