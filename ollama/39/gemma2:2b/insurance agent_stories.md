## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the office windows of Arthur Finch's small agency, mimicking the tumultuous storm brewing inside him.  The smell of stale coffee and damp paper hung heavy in the air, as did the weight of another disastrous day. Just hours ago, he had received a call from Mrs. Henderson - her prized bonsai collection had been destroyed by a rogue branch falling from a nearby willow tree, leaving her devastated and financially burdened.  Arthur knew this was just another domino falling on his already precarious life. The world felt as if it were tilting precariously towards the abyss, and he, like everyone else in the insurance industry, was caught in its violent current.
