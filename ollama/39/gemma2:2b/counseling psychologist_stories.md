The rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Thorne's windowpane like a thousand tiny fists. Inside her cozy Seattle apartment, nestled amongst towering trees and the scent of wet wood, Amelia was wrestling with the familiar unease that clung to her like cobwebs in the afternoon shadows.  It wasn't the storm itself; she felt a pang of empathy for those forced to brave the elements in search of shelter, but something deeper stirred within her as she stared at the swirling grey canvas above. 

Amelia Thorne was not just another counselor, not just another person dealing with the complexities of human emotions. Her mind held the weight of countless stories –  each etched onto her soul like a faded watercolor portrait. She'd spent years building a career on navigating the tangled pathways of grief, heartbreak, and the ever-shifting landscape of mental wellness. Yet tonight, even as she held her patients' struggles close to her heart, a storm within her own psyche raged against the calm facade. 

Tonight's case, Dr. Jones, was particularly disturbing. The man’s life had been ripped apart by a devastating car accident that took his wife and left him reeling in the aftermath of unimaginable loss.  Amelia's therapist-induced self-reflection promised to be a double dose of heavy – both the storm outside and the turmoil within. 


**Setting:** Seattle, Washington. A rainy day with overcast skies. The city's vibrant skyline is obscured by thick fog that settles over the iconic Space Needle at dusk.
