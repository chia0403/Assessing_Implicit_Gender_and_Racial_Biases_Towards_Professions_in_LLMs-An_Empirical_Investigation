Rain lashed against the window of 21 Baker Street, turning the worn brick facade into a swirling canvas of grey. Inside, Elara Thorne, her auburn hair tucked beneath a fedora, sat hunched over a dusty, leather-bound book. Its pages whispered secrets in forgotten tongues, but they were just as easily drowned out by the insistent drumming of thunder and the distant wail of sirens echoing from the city's bowels.  Her gaze flickered to the clock on her desk â€“ 3:17 AM. Not exactly prime time for a private eye, especially in this part of London.

Elara took a drag of her cigarette, a plume of smoke curling into the oppressive air. Her office was small but efficient - cluttered with files, old cases, and even a few jars of assorted spices she claimed were essential for "solving mysteries." But tonight, the case felt different. A heavy weight settled in her gut, a stark contrast to the usual anxieties that followed her around like stray cats. This wasn't just another missing person; this was about stolen memories.

The name on the file in front of her, etched in faded ink, sent a shiver down her spine:  "Miss Vivian Thorne."
