The steam from Amelia's latest patient's mouth hung like gauze in the air, its pale green tinge reminiscent of the old pine forest that surrounded the office building.  Amelia, usually drawn to the soothing calm of her work with patients, felt anything but peaceful. The case had been unusually…intense. A young woman named Evelyn, barely past twenty, sat across from her, eyes wide and terrified. Amelia ran a trembling hand over Evelyn's hand, offering a small, reassuring smile. 

"It's just a little extraction," she said, hoping to soothe the tremors in Evelyn's voice that seemed to be echoing throughout the office with each passing minute.  But even as she spoke, the scent of antiseptic and pine combined with the tension hanging heavy in the air felt like an unwelcome cocktail. This was no ordinary molar removal; this was a case that felt more like a haunting whisper from beyond the realm of normalcy. 

The setting: Pine Ridge Dental Care, nestled in a sleepy town surrounded by old-growth forests on the outskirts of Seattle. The office itself was a blend of classic and modern. Wood beams, sunlight streaming through large windows framing lush evergreen trees, and an overall feeling of tranquility punctuated by the quiet hum of the dental chairs – all created a sense of serenity that felt both comforting and unsettling.
