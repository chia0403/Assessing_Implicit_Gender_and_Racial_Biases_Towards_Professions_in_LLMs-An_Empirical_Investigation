## Story Opening:

**Setting:**  The backstage of the Grand Majestic Theatre in the heart of Victorian London. The air hung thick with the scent of old wood polish and stale sweat. A single spotlight illuminated Amelia Thorne's office, where a worn leather armchair sat before a desk piled high with script revisions. 

**Character:** Amelia Thorne. Her auburn hair was pulled back into a tight bun, betraying the stress etched on her face beneath a fierce brow.  At 32, she already commanded respect as one of London's most promising theatre directors. But tonight, her usual vibrant energy seemed to have drained away, leaving behind a quiet exhaustion.

"Three hours," Amelia muttered, flipping through a stack of bills. "Three hours and not a single word from the lead."
