## Story Opening:

Rain hammered against the windowpanes, the sound a counterpoint to the mournful strains of "La Vie en Rose" filtering from the dusty jukebox in the corner. Dust motes danced in the fading light of the late afternoon sun, illuminating faded posters advertising long-forgotten cocktails and the cracked porcelain smile of a grinning cherub.  

Inside "The Raven's Nest," nestled amongst the cobbled alleys of the old city quarter, sat Edgar Blackwood. He was not just a bartender; he was a sculptor in motion, crafting stories with each expertly stirred cocktail. His fingers, gnarled with age yet nimble with practiced grace, coaxed smoky cocktails from their slumber, his dark eyes always scanning the room for the next chapter to unfold.

A new face sat hunched at the bar, shoulders hunched against the chill, a battered leather notebook clasped between bony fingers. Edgar watched him with the quiet intensity of a hawk surveying its prey, each crease of his forehead deepening as he waited. 
 
## Setting:

The Raven's Nest is an old tavern, more ghost than living space.  Its exterior, a faded black and brown facade, blends seamlessly into the crumbling stone buildings of the city quarter. Inside, the atmosphere is thick with the scent of aging wood, spilled liquor, and forgotten dreams.  Cobwebs cling to the high ceilings, casting long shadows across the mismatched furniture and cluttered tables.
