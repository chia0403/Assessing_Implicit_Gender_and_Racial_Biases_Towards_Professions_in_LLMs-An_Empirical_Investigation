##  The Whispering Walls of Blackwood Manor

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the whispering woods of Cornwall. The manor itself is a looming gothic structure, its dark stone facade punctuated by gargoyle-laden spires and arched windows that seem to stare out at the world beyond with an unsettling intensity. Rain lashed against the windows, casting dancing shadows on the worn floorboards.  

**Main Character:** Thomas Blackwood (a.k.a. Tom) - A stoic groundskeeper who has spent his life tending to the overgrown gardens and whispering trees of the manor, often venturing into the depths of the woods where he claimed a wild sort of peace among the rustling leaves and murmuring wind.

A shiver ran down Tom's spine as he finished clearing the last of the fallen branches. The Manor, usually shrouded in a comforting mist that clung to its stone walls, was tonight cloaked in a raw kind of fear. He felt it in the creak of the ancient floorboards under his worn boots and a cold prickle on the back of his neck as he looked at the sky – an ominous tapestry of swirling grey clouds that seemed to groan with unspoken secrets. 

He’d always considered himself an outsider here, a solitary creature who found solace in the company of the earth and its whispering truths.  The Blackwood family was steeped in a kind of melancholic isolation that seemed to seep into the very fabric of the manor. And tonight, as he walked through the shadowed corridors, Tom felt it – a growing unease that settled like dust on his skin. 

He wasn't afraid exactly. He was simply… unnerved. There were whispers in the woods, stories spun by those who sought solace in their own fears. Whispers of strange lights dancing at night beneath the ancient oak trees and unexplained footsteps echoing through the silence. Tonight, Tom felt a creeping suspicion that these whispers might be more than mere folklore - he just didn't know what they meant.
