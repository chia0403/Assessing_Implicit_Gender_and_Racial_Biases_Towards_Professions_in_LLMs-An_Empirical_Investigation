Outside, the city hummed with its usual chaotic symphony of sirens, car horns, and distant construction, but within these walls, the world seemed to pause.  

Amy watched as Ethan Carter, a young man whose face was etched with exhaustion and frustration, gripped the worn handle of the exercise bike.

The air crackled with anticipation, a silent question hanging between them: would today be the day he started to ride again?
