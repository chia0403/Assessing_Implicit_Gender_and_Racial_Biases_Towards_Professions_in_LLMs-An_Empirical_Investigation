The air in the interview room was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, sat across from Michael Harper, his face pale and etched with worry lines that seemed far too deep for a man barely thirty.  

Eleanor glanced at the file on her desk: *Subject: Michael Harper; Accused of first-degree murder; Potential defense: diminished capacity*. A chill ran down her spine despite the stifling heat. This wasn't just another case â€“ Michael Harper was a former colleague, someone she had once considered a friend.

The sterile white walls of the interrogation room at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department seemed to amplify the tension. It felt like a stage set for a tragedy, and Eleanor, despite years of navigating the darkest corners of the human psyche, found herself feeling an unwelcome pang of empathy. The weight of Michael's accusation, the potential consequences, hung heavy in the air, a tangible presence threatening to suffocate them both.
