The ancient, oak-panelled library at Blackwood University hummed with the quiet rustle of turning pages and the soft click of keyboards. Professor Evelyn Alistair Bellweather, her silver hair pulled back in a severe bun, navigated the labyrinthine aisles with practiced ease.  She paused before a towering bookshelf, its spines crammed with leather-bound volumes, their titles whispering secrets from centuries past. Her fingers traced the worn edges of a particularly thick tome, its title barely visible beneath layers of dust: “The Codex Umbrae.”

Evelyn knew this book like the back of her hand. It was the cornerstone of her research on ancient magics, and the key to unlocking the mysteries surrounding Blackwood’s own history - a history steeped in whispered legends of powerful spells and forgotten alliances. Tonight, however, Evelyn felt a strange pull towards the Codex, an unsettling urge that defied logic and reason. She knew this was more than mere academic curiosity; something within its pages called to her, promising both knowledge and danger in equal measure. 


The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the library floor, highlighting dust motes dancing in the air. Evelyn took a deep breath, steeling herself for the journey into the unknown that lay ahead. The Codex Umbrae had always held secrets; tonight, it seemed, those secrets were ready to be revealed.
