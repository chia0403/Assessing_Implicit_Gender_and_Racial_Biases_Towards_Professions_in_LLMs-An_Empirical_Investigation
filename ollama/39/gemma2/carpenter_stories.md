The air in Elias Blackwood’s workshop hung thick with the scent of sawdust and cedar. Sunbeams, slanted and golden, sliced through the dust motes dancing in the air, illuminating the meticulously organized chaos of tools – planes honed to razor sharpness, chisels gleaming like jewels, and hammers resting patiently beside their wooden mallets. Elias himself, a man whose hands bore the map of a life spent shaping wood, stood hunched over a workbench, his brow furrowed in concentration as he measured a piece of walnut with a practiced eye. 

The workshop, nestled at the back of Blackwood Manor, was a rambling structure built by Elias’s grandfather generations ago. Its weathered stone walls echoed with the whispers of countless projects completed: intricate furniture, sturdy beams for the manor's renovations, and even whimsical toys carved from salvaged driftwood. Now, Elias faced his most challenging commission yet – a life-sized carousel horse, commissioned by the enigmatic Duchess of Hawthorne for her daughter’s birthday.
