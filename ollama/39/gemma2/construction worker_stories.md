The air hung thick with dust, grit clinging to Amelia "Amy" Harper's eyelashes like stubborn sand.  She squinted, wiping them away with the back of her gloved hand, watching the sunrise bleed orange and pink over the steel skeleton of the new skyscraper. A symphony of clanging metal, whirring drills, and shouted instructions echoed around them, a familiar morning chorus in this concrete jungle. 

Amy stood on the fourth floor platform, her boots firmly planted on the steel grating, the city sprawling beneath her like a waking dragon. The wind whipped through the gaps between the half-erected walls, carrying with it the faint scent of exhaust and fresh tarmac.  She took a deep breath, savoring the metallic tang that was as much a part of her as the calluses on her hands. This wasn't just another job site; this was home, the only place where she felt truly alive.
