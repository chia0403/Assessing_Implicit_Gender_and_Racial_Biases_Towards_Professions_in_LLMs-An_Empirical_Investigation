The air hung thick with the metallic scent of blood and the earthy aroma of sawdust, a familiar symphony to Finnigan “Finn” McCready’s nostrils.  His worn apron, splattered with crimson souvenirs from past dissections, felt as much a part of him as his calloused hands. The light filtering through the grimy windows of “McCready’s Meats,” cast long shadows across the cold steel cleavers and hooks that lined the walls. Each cut of meat hung like a silent testament to Finn's skill, from plump roasts to delicate sausages, all waiting for their transformation into something more than just flesh.

The bell above the door jangled, pulling Finn from his reverie. He glanced up to see a woman step inside, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and a cloud of apprehension. This wasn't like the usual crowd - regulars who knew Finn’s reputation for quality and his blunt, no-nonsense demeanor. This one looked lost, a stray caught in the butcher’s labyrinthine shop.

"What can I do for you?" Finn asked, wiping down a cleaver with a rag as he watched her approach, hesitant steps echoing on the cold wooden floor.
