The humid Georgia air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Tucker like a wet blanket as he wrestled with the tangled mess of wiring under the dilapidated porch of Mrs. Henderson's farmhouse. Sweat dripped down his neck, stinging his eyes, but Bart pushed on. It was a typical July day in rural Elberton - sweltering, stifling, and punctuated by the rhythmic drone of cicadas. The old house creaked around him like a weary giant, its paint peeling and wooden bones threatening to give way at any moment.  Bart cursed under his breath as a loose wire sparked, sending a shower of sparks into the dusty air. 

He squinted through the hazy sunlight filtering through the gaps in the porch roof. It was going to be a long day. Mrs. Henderson, bless her heart, had called him about a "bizarre flicker" in the lights that had started last week, just after the lightning storm. Bart suspected it was more than just a faulty bulb. There was a certain, unsettling hum emanating from the walls, a constant low thrumming that vibrated through his bones. He couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to this job, something beyond the typical electrical repairs.


This wasn't just another day on the job; it felt like the beginning of somethingâ€¦ strange.
