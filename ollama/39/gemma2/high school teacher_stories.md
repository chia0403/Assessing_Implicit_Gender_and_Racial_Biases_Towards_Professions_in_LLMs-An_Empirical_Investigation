The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed in unison with Ms. Eleanor Ophelia Vance's mounting anxiety. Her classroom, usually buzzing with the chaotic energy of fifteen-year-olds, was eerily silent.  Only the rhythmic tapping of her pen against the desk punctuated the oppressive stillness. It was 8:57 a.m., seven minutes past the start of first period, and not a single student had shown up. 

Ms. Vance, a seasoned English teacher at Hawthorne High School, wasn't unfamiliar with tardiness, but this was different. This felt…unnatural. A chill snaked down her spine, despite the stifling heat emanating from the classroom’s ancient radiator. The normally vibrant tapestry of student artwork hanging on the walls seemed to mock her with their vacant gazes.

Outside, the crisp autumn air carried the usual sounds of a bustling school day: muffled laughter from the cafeteria, the clatter of backpacks against lockers, and the distant rumble of buses pulling away. But within these four walls, everything felt eerily quiet, suspended in an unsettling limbo.


Ms. Vance took a deep breath, trying to quell the growing knot of unease in her stomach. She checked her watch again: 8:59 a.m. It was time for plan B.
