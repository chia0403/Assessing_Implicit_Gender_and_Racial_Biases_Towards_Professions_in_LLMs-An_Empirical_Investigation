The crimson sun bled across the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the rusted oil rigs jutting out of the shimmering desert expanse. The wind, hot and gritty, whipped Amelia “Ace” Thorne’s dark hair around her face as she adjusted the worn leather strap of her flight helmet. Her knuckles whitened against the cold metal of the cockpit door as she waited for the engine to roar to life. 

Ace was a veteran pilot, hardened by years of ferrying cargo across the desolate expanse of the Rubicon Wasteland – a landscape ravaged by a cataclysmic solar storm decades ago. Today's delivery: precious water, vital for survival in this unforgiving desert. Her destination: Oasis Station, a crumbling haven clinging to existence on the edge of a vast sand sea.  


The wasteland stretched before her, a canvas of bleached bone and ochre sand. The silence was broken only by the mournful whistle of the wind, a constant reminder of the harsh realities that governed their lives. Ace gripped the controls tighter, her heart pounding in time with the rising hum of the engine. Another day, another journey into the unknown.
