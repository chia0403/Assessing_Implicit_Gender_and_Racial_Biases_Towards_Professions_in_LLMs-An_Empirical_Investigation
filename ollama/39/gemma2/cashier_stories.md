The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright's head like a chorus of agitated bees. Each buzz seemed to amplify the dull ache in her lower back, a constant companion since she'd started working the graveyard shift at Bob's Discount Bargain Bonanza.  

Eleanor swiped a chipped blue ceramic frog through the scanner, its price ringing up as $1.99 on the screen above. Another sale for another lonely customer browsing the aisles past midnight. The air in the store hung heavy with the scent of stale popcorn and discount cologne. She yearned for the quiet chirping of crickets outside, the soft rustle of leaves beneath her feet - anything but the sterile silence punctuated by the beep-boop symphony of the register.  

Outside, a storm brewed. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon glow of Bob's Discount Bargain Bonanza sign into a shimmering rainbow. Inside, Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright felt utterly alone.
