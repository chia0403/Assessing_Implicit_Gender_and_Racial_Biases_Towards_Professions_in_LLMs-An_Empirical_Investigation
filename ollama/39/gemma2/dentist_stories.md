The whirring of the ultrasonic scaler was a familiar lullaby to Dr. Amelia Rose Blackwood.  She traced it along Mrs. Higgins' incisor, watching the gritty plaque crumble away like dry sandcastles. The antiseptic scent of the air mingled with the faint aroma of peppermint toothpaste, creating a uniquely comforting fragrance in her dental practice nestled within the bustling heart of Oakhaven. Outside, the late spring sun streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the waiting area where Mrs. Peterson anxiously tapped her foot, clutching a well-worn copy of "Pride and Prejudice." 

Amelia paused, taking a moment to observe the scene before turning back to Mrs. Higgins. Oakhaven, with its charming brick facades and cobblestone streets, was as familiar to Amelia as the placement of each instrument in her sterilizer drawer.  But lately, beneath the comforting rhythm of her daily routine, a quiet disquiet had begun to hum.
