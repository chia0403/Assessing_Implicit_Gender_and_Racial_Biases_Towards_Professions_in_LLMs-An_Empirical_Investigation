The diesel engine growled like a tired beast, its breath fogging in the pre-dawn chill.  Inside the cab, Silas "Ironhand" Jackson rubbed the sleep from his eyes, squinting through the windshield at the endless ribbon of highway stretching before him. The sunrise was barely a whisper on the horizon, casting long shadows that danced with the swaying blades of tallgrass lining the road.  

Silas gripped the worn leather steering wheel, feeling the familiar rumble of the eighteen-wheeler beneath his calloused hands.  He'd been hauling freight across this desolate stretch of Nevada for ten years, his loyal rig, a Peterbilt 379 affectionately nicknamed "Old Girl," his only companion in the vast emptiness. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic hum of the engine and the occasional crackle of static from the CB radio.

Tonight, Silas had a deadline.  A shipment of delicate microchips destined for Silicon Valley, a cargo that could make or break a young tech company's future. He wasn't just delivering freight; he was delivering dreams. But as the miles ticked by and the desert sun climbed higher, a strange unease settled in Silas' gut. Something felt off.  


The setting is a desolate stretch of Nevada highway, early morning. The air is crisp and quiet, with only the rumble of Silas's truck breaking the silence.
