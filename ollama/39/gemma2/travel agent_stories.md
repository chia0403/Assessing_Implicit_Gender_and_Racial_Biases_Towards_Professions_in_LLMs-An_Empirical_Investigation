The air in "Amelia's Escapes" hummed with the quiet energy of anticipation. It wasn't just the scent of freshly brewed coffee from the mini-espresso machine tucked in the corner, or the soft jazz playing on Amelia Brighton’s vintage record player, it was the atmosphere that she meticulously cultivated. Each inch of her travel agency in Portland, Oregon, throbbed with wanderlust - from the framed photographs of snow-capped Himalayan peaks to the hand-painted globe hanging above the reception desk.

Amelia herself was a whirlwind of organized chaos. Her blonde curls were perpetually escaping their braid, and her hands flew across the keyboard as she responded to client emails while simultaneously sketching a possible itinerary for a honeymoon in Tuscany on a notepad. A smile played on her lips as she read a message from Mr. Henderson, requesting a "surprise" trip for his wife’s birthday – Amelia lived for these kinds of challenges.  

But beneath the energetic facade, Amelia felt a nagging emptiness. Her own wanderlust had been put on hold for years, sacrificed for the dream of owning her agency and helping others discover the magic of travel. Yet, lately, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. 


The bell above the door chimed, pulling Amelia back to the present. A tall, lanky man stood hesitantly in the doorway, his gaze flitting around the office before landing on Amelia. He clutched a worn leather suitcase in one hand and a crumpled map in the other. This wasn't your typical client. 


"Can I help you?" Amelia asked, her voice laced with curiosity.
