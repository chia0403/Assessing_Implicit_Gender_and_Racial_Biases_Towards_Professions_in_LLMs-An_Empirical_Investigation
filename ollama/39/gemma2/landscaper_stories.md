The midday sun beat down on Amelia Hawthorne’s neck as she wrestled with a stubborn oak root. Sweat stung her eyes, but she couldn't stop. The client, a wealthy socialite named Mrs. Van Derlyn, was notorious for her exacting standards and Amelia wasn't about to disappoint. 

Amelia, her hands calloused from years of coaxing life from the earth, gripped the shovel with renewed determination. She had dreamed of being a botanist, but practicality had led her to landscaping instead. It wasn't glamorous, but it allowed her to work with nature, which was all that truly mattered.  

The setting was Mrs. Van Derlyn's sprawling estate in Aspen, Colorado. Towering pines fringed the manicured lawns and vibrant flowerbeds burst with color against the backdrop of snow-capped mountains. Despite its beauty, Amelia felt a prickle of unease. There was something about the stillness of this place, a hushed expectancy that made her skin crawl.  The mansion itself loomed like a watchful giant, its windows dark despite the bright afternoon.


Amelia wiped her brow and took a moment to survey the scene.  The oak tree needed to be moved to make space for Mrs. Van Derlyn’s new rose garden, a project Amelia found both daunting and strangely alluring. The scent of freshly cut grass mingled with the earthy aroma of pine needles, creating a heady perfume that filled the air. She took a deep breath and steeled herself. There was work to be done.
