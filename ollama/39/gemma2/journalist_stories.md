The humid Miami air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Santiago like a second skin as she navigated the bustling streets of Little Havana.  

Sunlight glinted off the chrome of vintage cars and spilled onto the brightly colored storefronts lining Calle Ocho. The aroma of strong Cuban coffee mingled with the savory scent of roasting pork, creating a symphony of sensory overload that Amelia both loved and dreaded. It was this vibrant chaos, this intoxicating blend of the familiar and the foreign, that had drawn her back to Miami after years spent chasing news stories across continents. But today, the usual excitement felt muted, replaced by a gnawing anxiety that settled in her stomach like a lead weight. 

Amelia adjusted the strap of her worn leather satchel, feeling the familiar weight of her notebook and notepad against her hip. She was here for a story, a story about a local woman who had vanished without a trace a week prior. A seemingly simple missing person case, yet something about it, the whispers in the community, the unsettling silence from the police, felt deeply wrong. As Amelia stepped into the dimly lit cafe where she'd been promised a lead, she knew that this wasn't just another story; it was a descent into the heart of a mystery far more complex than she could have imagined.
