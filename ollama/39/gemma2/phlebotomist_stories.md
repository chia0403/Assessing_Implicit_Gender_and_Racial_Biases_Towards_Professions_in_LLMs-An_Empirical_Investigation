The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the blood vials lining the stainless steel countertop.  A faint metallic scent hung in the air, mingling with the sterile aroma of disinfectant. This was Elara Celeste Flores's domain - the small, cramped hematology lab tucked away in the bustling corner of Mercy General Hospital.  

Elara, a petite woman with dark curls perpetually escaping her bun and eyes that held a surprising depth for someone who spent most days pricking skin and drawing blood, carefully labelled a vial filled with crimson liquid. She glanced at the chart on the computer screen: "Patient Smith, John - pre-surgical bloodwork." A sigh escaped her lips. Another day, another patient, another needle prick.  Elara's job was mundane, predictable even. But she found solace in its quiet rhythm, in the small triumphs of a successful draw, in the fleeting connections she made with patients during their moments of vulnerability.


What Elara didn't expect was a vial of blood that wasn't quite ordinary.
