The acrid scent of sewage hung heavy in the air, clinging to everything like a shroud. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Mrs. Periwinkle's shed, each drop exploding with a miniature clap of thunder. Inside, huddled beneath a flickering fluorescent light, sat Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick, his brow furrowed in concentration as he wrestled with a stubborn pipe fitting. 

His calloused fingers, stained a permanent shade of rust-brown from years of battling clogged drains and burst pipes, tightened their grip on the wrench. The insistent drumming of rain seemed to mock him, each beat a tiny hammer against his already frayed patience.  

"Blast it all," Bart muttered under his breath, wiping sweat from his forehead with a grimy rag. Mrs. Periwinkle's ancient plumbing system was giving him a run for his money, and the clock was ticking. The storm was due to worsen, threatening to turn the already soggy backyard into a churning swamp.  

Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the flimsy walls of the shed. Inside, Bart Thistlewick, plumber extraordinaire (at least in his own mind), knew he had one shot at saving Mrs. Periwinkle's toilet from becoming another victim of the tempestuous night.
