The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and desperation. Lila Mae Clementine wiped down the sticky tabletop with a rag that was more stained than clean, her movements echoing through the near-empty diner. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the chipped Formica counter and faded vinyl booths. It was 3:00 AM, well past the witching hour for most establishments, but the Starlight Diner remained stubbornly open, a beacon of greasy comfort in the desolate pre-dawn darkness of Amarillo, Texas. Lila Mae, a woman hardened by years of late nights and even later customers, leaned against the counter, chewing on her lower lip as she watched the rain lash against the windowpanes. The storm outside mirrored the tempest brewing within her – a storm that threatened to consume everything she held dear. 


She knew tonight was different. Tonight wasn't just about another shift, another plate of lukewarm coffee and soggy fries.  Tonight, something felt…off.
