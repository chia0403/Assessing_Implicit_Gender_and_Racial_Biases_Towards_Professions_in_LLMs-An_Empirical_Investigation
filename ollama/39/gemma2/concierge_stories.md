The air in the Grand Bellini Hotel shimmered with the heat of the late afternoon sun.  Even the marble floors seemed to sweat, reflecting the light in an almost iridescent haze. This was Naples, after all – summer had arrived in a blaze of glory. 

Standing at his post, Antonio di Fiore surveyed the scene with an air of weary resignation. The lobby buzzed with tourists, their accents and languages forming a chaotic symphony that only he, as Concierge extraordinaire, could navigate with ease. He straightened his crisp white uniform jacket, adjusting the miniature hotel bell pin on his lapel. His smile was practiced, warm yet efficient, like a barista expertly churning out lattes in peak hour. 


Antonio had seen it all – honeymooners giddy with love, families frazzled by travel woes, and lone businessmen drowning in spreadsheets. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along his spine, whispering warnings he couldn't quite decipher.  He just knew that the day wouldn’t unfold like any other.
