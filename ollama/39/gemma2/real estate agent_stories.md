Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's office, blurring the glittering cityscape into an impressionist painting. She chewed on her pen, staring at the email notification blinking accusingly on her screen: "Refinancing Request Denied - Client #4327." Another one bites the dust.  

Amelia sighed, rubbing a hand across her tired eyes. This wasn't how she envisioned her day. The vibrant, sun-soaked open houses and enthusiastic first-time homebuyers were replaced by dreary offices, frantic clients battling loan sharks, and the ever-present sting of rejection. She missed the spark in people's eyes when they found their dream homes, the shared excitement of signing on the dotted line.  

Maybe it was time for a change, she thought, gazing out at the storm swirling below. Maybe it was time to find her own haven, a place where the rain couldn't dampen her spirits and the cityscape felt like more than just a backdrop to disappointment.
