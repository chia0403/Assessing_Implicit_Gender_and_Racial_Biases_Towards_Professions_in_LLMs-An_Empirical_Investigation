The stale scent of old paper and ink clung to Beatrice Thistlewick like a second skin. It was a comforting aroma, one that had filled her tiny office in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town for twenty years. Sunlight filtered through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating the rows upon rows of ledgers, each meticulously balanced by her steady hand. Outside, the cobblestone streets were bustling with tourists and locals alike, but inside Beatrice's world remained a sanctuary of order and precision.

Her current task was particularly intriguing: untangling the financial mess left behind by a recently deceased antiquarian bookseller named Alistair Finchley. His ledgers were chaotic, filled with cryptic notes and bizarre entries for "talking skulls" and "invisible ink". Beatrice, normally a stickler for convention, found herself strangely drawn into the mystery of Finchley's peculiar dealings.  

As she pored over the faded script, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, a small, handwritten note tucked between two pages caught her eye. "Beware the Raven," it read in Alistair's spidery handwriting. 


Beatrice shivered despite the warmth of the afternoon sun. This was no ordinary bookkeeping job. This felt like the beginning of a story.
