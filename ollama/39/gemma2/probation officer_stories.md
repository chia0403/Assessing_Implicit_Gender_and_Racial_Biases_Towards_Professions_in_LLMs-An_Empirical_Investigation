The stale scent of coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Ms. Evelyn "Eve" Blackwood's cramped office.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the relentless pounding headache behind her eyes. She rubbed at her temples, trying to ignore the insistent buzzing of her phone. It was 8:30 am on a Tuesday – prime time for probationers to either forget their appointments or show up late, reeking of stale cigarettes and excuses.

Eve’s office, nestled in a forgotten corner of the city courthouse, felt more like a holding cell than a place of justice. Worn, beige walls were adorned with faded motivational posters that seemed to mock her weary spirit. Stacks of paperwork threatened to engulf her desk, each file representing another soul caught in the tangled web of the legal system. 

Today's first appointment was Liam O’Connell, a young man with a troubled past and a volatile temper, notorious for bending the rules as easily as he bent his own iron will. Eve felt a familiar knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach. She knew dealing with Liam would be like trying to herd cats – messy, unpredictable, and likely to end with a few scratched arms.


She reached for her coffee mug, the chipped porcelain offering little comfort.  Liam was going to be interesting.
