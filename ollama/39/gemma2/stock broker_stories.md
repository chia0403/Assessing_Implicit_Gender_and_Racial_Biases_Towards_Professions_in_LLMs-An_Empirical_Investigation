The stale air of the trading floor clung to Eleanor Alistair like a second skin.  Sunlight, filtered through the glass skyscraperâ€™s impossibly high windows, sliced through the haze of cigarette smoke and desperation. Screens flickered, displaying a dizzying array of numbers that moved faster than Eleanor's aging eyes could follow. The cacophony of ringing phones, barked orders, and triumphant yelps was a constant symphony of stress, punctuated by the occasional groan of defeat. 

Eleanor, perched at her station amidst the frenzied chaos, sipped lukewarm coffee from a chipped mug. Her fingers, calloused from years of navigating keyboards and scribbling frantic notes on legal pads, hovered over the phone headset.  Today was "Black Friday" - not the day after Thanksgiving known for retail mayhem, but the dreaded quarterly earnings report release day. The air crackled with anticipation and fear in equal measure, a palpable tension that had settled over the entire trading floor like a shroud. For Eleanor, it wasn't just about the numbers; it was about proving herself again, to her colleagues, to her clients, and most importantly, to herself.
