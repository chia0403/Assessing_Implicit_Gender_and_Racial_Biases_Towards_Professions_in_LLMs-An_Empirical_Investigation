The flickering neon sign outside The Rusty Note cast a sickly yellow glow onto Evelyn "Eve" Beaumont's face as she sat slumped against the cracked brick wall. Rain lashed down, each drop exploding in a miniature burst on the pavement.  Her voice, usually so strong and clear, now felt rough and raw, barely able to muster a whisper above the din of the storm. 

The Rusty Note was a dive bar, tucked away in a forgotten corner of New Orleans, where dreams went to drown their sorrows in cheap whiskey and second-rate blues. Eve had once dreamed of playing bigger stages, brighter lights, but tonight, she just yearned for the simple solace of a warm cup of coffee and a place to hide from the storm – both metaphorical and literal. 


Her fingers tightened around her worn guitar case, a shield against the world that seemed determined to swallow her whole.  Each note she had played tonight felt hollow, devoid of the passion that usually fueled her performances. The crowd, a motley collection of regulars and lost souls seeking temporary oblivion, hadn't even bothered to clap at the end of her set. 

Eve knew this wasn’t just about a bad night. There was a deeper ache gnawing at her soul, a sense of emptiness that no amount of applause or adulation could fill.
