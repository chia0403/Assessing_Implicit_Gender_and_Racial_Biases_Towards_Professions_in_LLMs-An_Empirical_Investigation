The humid air hung heavy over New Orleans, thick with the scent of jasmine and stale beignets. Rain threatened, the sky bruised purple and grey above the wrought iron balconies that adorned the French Quarter. Detective Amelia "Amy" Dubois sat on her porch swing, nursing a lukewarm cup of chicory coffee, its bitter taste mirroring her mood. The rhythmic creak of the swing seemed to echo the steady thrumming in her chest – a dull ache she’d come to associate with unsolved cases and sleepless nights. 


Tonight's case was particularly grim: a young jazz musician found lifeless in his apartment, strangled with a length of guitar string. A chilling note left on the wall read, "The music dies." Amy grimaced; the city had become a graveyard for dreams lately, each victim another silenced melody lost to the night. The rain finally broke, fat drops splattering onto the cracked concrete and sending rivulets cascading down the street.  Amy took another sip of her coffee, steeling herself for the grim reality waiting at the precinct. She had a city to protect, a score to settle, and a symphony of justice to conduct.
