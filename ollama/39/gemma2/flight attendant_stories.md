The gentle hum of the engines was a familiar lullaby to Amelia "Amy" Rosethorn.  She smoothed down her crisp blue uniform, the soft fabric catching on her silver name tag - 'A. Rosethorn' - that glinted under the cabin lights. Her reflection in the mirrored wall showed a woman of quiet grace: dark hair pulled back neatly, eyes a piercing hazel green that seemed to take in everything and nothing at once.  

She was on Flight 347, bound for Lisbon from London Heathrow, her route well-trodden and predictable. The passengers were mostly businessmen, their faces etched with the weariness of long flights and even longer days. Amy knew their routines by heart: the frantic scramble for overhead compartments, the hushed whispers into cellphones, the awkward attempts at conversation over lukewarm coffee. 

But this time, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she looked out the window at the moonlit clouds swirling below. There was a stillness in the air, an almost oppressive silence that hadn't been there on previous flights. And then she noticed it: a faint, ethereal glow emanating from somewhere beyond the horizon. It pulsed softly, like a distant heartbeat. 


Amy swallowed nervously. She had flown countless times, weathered every storm and turbulence, but this...this was something new. Something unsettling.
