The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and sweat in Elias Thorne's workshop. Sunlight slanted through the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the dust that swirled around his feet.  Elias, hammer resting on his weathered workbench, squinted at the rough block of jade he was chipping away at. It was a piece brought from a faraway land by a travelling merchant, rumored to contain a spirit trapped within its green depths. Elias wasn't sure about spirits, but he knew good stone when he saw it. This one, even in its raw form, hummed with an inner light, a subtle energy that prickled against his skin.

His workshop, tucked away on a cobbled side street in the port city of Aethelgard, was a sanctuary from the bustling crowds and clamour of trade. Here, amidst the clutter of tools and half-finished sculptures, Elias found peace. The rhythmic clang of his hammer, the rasping grind of his files, the soft sigh of stone yielding to his touch â€“ these were the sounds that soothed his soul. 


Today, however, the familiar rhythm was disrupted by a gnawing unease. A sense of foreboding hung in the air, thick and oppressive like the humid morning fog. Elias dismissed it as city stress, but the feeling lingered, a persistent itch beneath his skin. He turned back to his work, needing the focus the jade offered, praying that the stone's hidden spirit wouldn't be disturbed by the darkness gathering at Aethelgard's heart.
