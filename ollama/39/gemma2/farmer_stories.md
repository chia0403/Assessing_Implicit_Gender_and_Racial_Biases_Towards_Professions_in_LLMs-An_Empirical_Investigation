The pre-dawn air hung heavy with the scent of dew-laden clover and damp earth. A thin layer of mist clung to the fields surrounding Willow Creek Farm, obscuring the rolling hills beyond.  

Eleanor Beatrice Harper, known to everyone simply as Ellie, squinted into the rising sun, its pale rays filtering through the haze. Her weathered face, framed by a mess of unruly auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, held the weariness of a long day already spent. The chickens had been restless all night, her prize-winning rooster crowing with unusual ferocity. She could only hope it wasnâ€™t another fox prowling the coop.

Ellie reached for her worn leather apron hanging on the hook by the door, its pockets overflowing with seeds and tools of her trade. Her boots, scuffed and mud-stained, slapped against the porch as she stepped onto the dew-soaked grass. Another day in the life of a farmer, another day of tending to her land, her animals, her legacy.
