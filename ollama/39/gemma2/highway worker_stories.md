The sun bled across the asphalt horizon, painting long, fiery streaks against the dust-choked air.  A haze hung heavy over Interstate 80, shimmering like a mirage in the early morning heat. The silence was broken only by the distant rumble of eighteen-wheelers and the occasional clatter of construction equipment. This wasn't Kansas anymore; this was Nevada, where the land stretched endlessly before you, parched and unforgiving.

Ethan Caldwell, his face etched with lines from years under the merciless desert sun, squinted at the horizon. He shifted his weight, the rough denim of his work pants chafing against his calloused skin. He hefted a heavy metal sign, its faded lettering proclaiming "Detour Ahead: Road Closed." Ethan didn't mind the isolation; it was the only company he truly craved after years of hauling asphalt and mending shattered dreams on this desolate stretch of highway.  But today felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine, a feeling that something wasn't quite right. The silence seemed to press in on him, heavier than usual, pregnant with unspoken secrets.
