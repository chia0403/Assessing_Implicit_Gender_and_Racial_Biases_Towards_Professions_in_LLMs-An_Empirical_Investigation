The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile, pale light across Dr. Eleanor Vance's office. Paperclips clinked as she sorted through files, each one a miniature universe of anxieties, fears, and triumphs belonging to the children entrusted to her care. Outside, the bell marking the end of the school day shrieked its usual cacophony, sending a wave of muffled noise through the thin walls.

Eleanor sighed, rubbing her temples. Today had been particularly draining. A new student, a boy named Finn, had arrived with a quiet intensity that unnerved even her seasoned intuition. He seemed to carry a weight far too heavy for his ten years, refusing to speak about anything beyond basic facts.  His silence, coupled with the unsettling drawings he'd left on his desk - stark black lines against the white paper depicting twisted figures and empty eyes - sent a chill down Eleanor's spine.

Her gaze fell upon Finn's file again. It was thin, almost pitifully so, containing little information about his past or family. A single note from his previous school mentioned "behavioral issues" and a recommendation for intensive therapy.  Eleanor frowned, pushing the thought away. This wasn't just another case; something felt profoundly different, like a dark undercurrent threatening to pull them both into its depths. 


The setting is a small suburban elementary school in a mid-western town, a place seemingly idyllic on the surface but harboring secrets beneath its manicured lawns and cheerful facades.
