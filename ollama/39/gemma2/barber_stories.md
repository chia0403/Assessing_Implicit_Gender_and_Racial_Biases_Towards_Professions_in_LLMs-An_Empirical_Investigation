The bell above the door jingled its usual melancholic tune as Jeremiah Bartholomew "Remy" Finch surveyed his empty shop.  Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the rows of neatly arranged clippers and combs on the mahogany shelves behind him. The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, a nostalgic perfume that spoke of bygone days, of gentlemen with slicked-back hair and crisp suits. Remy sighed, running a hand through his own unruly, dark curls.  It had been three weeks since Mr. Henderson, his most loyal customer, passed away.  His death left a gaping hole in Remy's life, a hole that mirrored the emptiness of his shop.

The setting was Barstow, a small town nestled in the heart of Texas. Time seemed to move slower here, measured by the languid afternoons and the rhythmic chirping of crickets at dusk. The main street was lined with aging storefronts, each whispering stories of prosperity past. Remy's barber shop, "Finch & Sons," stood proudly at its corner, a testament to three generations of Barstow men who had learned to wield shears and razors with equal skill.  But now, the once vibrant shop felt like a tomb, echoing with the memories of laughter, gossip, and the comforting hum of clippers. 


The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the dusty street. Remy wiped down his already spotless counter, a gesture both mundane and purposeful. He knew he couldn't stay here forever, shrouded in grief and silence.  Barstow needed its barber, even if its heart had grown a little colder lately.
