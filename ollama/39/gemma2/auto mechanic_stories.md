The grease under Amelia "Amy" Gearhart's fingernails was more than just a badge of honor; it was practically a second skin. It mirrored the grime coating everything in her workshop, a symphony of rusted tools and tangled wires that could only be found on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Wyoming. 

Dustbowl was not a place for the faint of heart. The wind constantly whipped through the cracked asphalt streets, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and forgotten dreams. Buildings hunched against the relentless sun, their paint peeled back like scabs, revealing the weathered bones beneath. But Amy found solace in this chaos, in the rhythm of clanging wrenches and the guttural roar of engines coming back to life under her expert touch. 


This was her sanctuary, a greasy haven where she could fix anything with a spark plug and a prayer.
