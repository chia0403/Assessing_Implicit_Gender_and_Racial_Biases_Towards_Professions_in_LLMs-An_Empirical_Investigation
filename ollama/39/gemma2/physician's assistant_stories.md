The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and simmering anxiety in Dr. Anya Ivanova’s bustling clinic. Sunlight slanted through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. The waiting room was a cacophony of coughs, sniffles, and hushed conversations, punctuated by the occasional wail from a child clinging to their parent’s leg.  

Amidst this controlled chaos sat Amelia "Amy" Brighton, her name badge gleaming on her crisp scrubs. A physician's assistant for five years now, Amy was used to the frantic pace of Dr. Ivanova's practice – a haven for the city's uninsured and under-served. She preferred it this way. The constant stream of patients, each with their own unique story etched into their weary faces, kept her grounded, reminded her why she chose this path.  


Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she watched the clinic doors swing open, admitting a new patient – a man shrouded in shadows, his eyes holding a flicker of fear that resonated with Amy's own subconscious anxieties.
