Rain hammered against the frosted glass windows of the "Davis & Drake" office, mimicking the relentless thrumming in Amelia Harper's skull. The city outside was a blur of grey, mirroring the bleakness that had settled over her since last Friday. Last Friday, when Mr. Davis, her boss and the name behind the firm's prestigious facade, had informed her, with the air of someone announcing a minor inconvenience rather than shattering an ambition, that she wasn't "cut out" for legal work.

Amelia slumped deeper into her ergonomically designed chair, a pale imitation of comfort in this sterile, corporate environment. The mahogany desk before her, usually a battlefield of legal briefs and overflowing coffee mugs, was uncharacteristically bare. She felt like an abandoned chessboard, all pieces scattered, waiting to be swept away by the tide.

The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and disappointment. Even the potted fern in the corner seemed to droop under the weight of the city's relentless storm. A city that, unlike Amelia's aspirations, showed no signs of softening its harsh edges.
