The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume that clung to everything in Redwood Creek. Sunlight dappled through the towering redwoods, casting long shadows across the forest floor where Elias "Eli" Thorne knelt, carefully sharpening his axe. His calloused hands moved with practiced ease, honing the blade to a razor-sharp edge against the rough surface of a whetstone. 

Eli was one of the last loggers in Redwood Creek, a small town nestled deep within the redwood forests of Northern California. For generations, his family had worked these lands, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the trees. But times were changing, and the old ways were slowly fading.  The whispers of progress – about development, new roads, and concrete replacing ancient giants – echoed through the valley like a dissonant symphony, unsettling the quiet harmony Eli had always known. 


He glanced up at the towering redwoods that guarded the logging camp, their branches reaching towards the sky like gnarled fingers grasping for light. Each tree held stories within its rings, whispers of seasons past and resilience against time. But Eli knew the silence wouldn't last forever.  The bulldozers were waiting just outside the town limits, hungry to devour the forest and reshape it in their own image.
