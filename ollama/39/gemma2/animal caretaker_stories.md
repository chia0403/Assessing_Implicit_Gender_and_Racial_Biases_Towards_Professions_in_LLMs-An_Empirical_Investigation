The morning mist hung low over Willow Creek Sanctuary, clinging to the dew-laden grass like a ghostly shroud.  Sunlight struggled to pierce through the haze, casting long, wavering shadows across the sprawling grounds. A symphony of bird calls and rustling leaves filled the air, punctuated by the occasional bleat of a sheep or the soft whicker of a horse.

Eleanor Beatrice Finch adjusted her thick woolen gloves, her breath puffing out in small white clouds against the crisp autumn air.  Her sturdy boots crunched on the gravel path as she made her way towards the barn, her weathered canvas bag swinging against her hip. 

Ellie, as everyone called her, had been the caretaker at Willow Creek for nearly twenty years. She knew every nook and cranny of the sanctuary, every animal by name and temperament, and every whisper of the wind that carried the secrets of the forest.  Today, however, a sense of foreboding settled in her stomach like a stone. The animals seemed restless, their usual morning greetings subdued, replaced with an air of unease. Something was amiss, and Ellie, with a heart heavy with responsibility, knew she had to find out what.
