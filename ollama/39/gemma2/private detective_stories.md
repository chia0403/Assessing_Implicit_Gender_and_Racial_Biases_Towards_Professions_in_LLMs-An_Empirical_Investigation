The neon glow of the "Lucky Clover Lounge" cast a lurid pink hue over Detective Bartholomew "Barty" Finch's trench coat as he pushed through the sticky doors. The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke and cheap perfume, a symphony of scents that Barty had come to associate with trouble. 

He spotted his contact, a dame named Ruby, perched on a velvet stool at the far end of the bar. Her scarlet dress clung to her curves like liquid fire, and her emerald eyes were fixed on him as he approached. The Lucky Clover was notorious for its shady clientele and even shadier dealings. It wasn't Barty's usual haunt, but Ruby had promised information about a case that had been gnawing at him - the disappearance of Amelia Davenport, a socialite last seen entering the very same lounge three weeks ago.  


Barty pulled up a stool beside her, the chrome groaning under his weight. "Ruby," he said, his voice gravelly from too many late nights and cheap whiskey. "You got what I asked for?"
