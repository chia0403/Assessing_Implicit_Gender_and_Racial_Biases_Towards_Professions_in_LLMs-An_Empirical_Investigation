The stale air hung heavy in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby, thick with the scent of old money and forgotten dreams. It clung to Theodore Bartholomew "Teddy" Hastings like a second skin as he polished the brass doorknob for the tenth time that morning.  His movements were practiced, precise â€“ another facet of his carefully curated facade, one that hid the gnawing loneliness beneath. 

The Grand Blackwood, once a beacon of elegance and opulence, was now a shadow of its former glory. Its faded grandeur whispered through the peeling wallpaper, the threadbare carpets, and the vacant stares of the remaining guests. Teddy navigated this world with practiced ease, his bellhop uniform his armor, his smile his weapon against the encroaching despair. 


He yearned for something more, a life beyond polishing doorknobs and carrying suitcases filled with secrets. But in this crumbling palace, hope was a fragile thing, easily crushed beneath the weight of reality. And Teddy, despite his carefully constructed facade, was learning that sometimes, even the most dazzling bellhop can't escape the echoes of their own forgotten dreams.
