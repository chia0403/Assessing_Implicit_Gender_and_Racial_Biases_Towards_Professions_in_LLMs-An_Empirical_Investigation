The flickering neon sign outside "Mind Haven" cast an unsettling purple glow across Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's face as she locked up for the night.  Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the relentless drumming in her chest. It had been a long day. The kind where every patient seemed to carry a piece of their darkness inside them, threatening to spill over into the sterile white walls of her office.

Amelia stood there for a moment, watching the storm rage. Her small practice nestled on a quiet street in Baltimore was usually bathed in the warm golden light of streetlamps at this hour.  Tonight, however, the rain and wind conspired to shroud everything in an unsettling gloom. The familiar comfort she usually found in the routine of closing up felt absent tonight, replaced by a prickling unease that sent shivers down her spine.


She turned, intending to head out into the storm, when a flash of lightning illuminated a figure huddled under the awning across the street. A young man, soaked and shivering, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and desperation. The light flickered again, revealing a thin, bloodstained handkerchief clutched in his trembling hand. 

Amelia's heart lurched. Something wasn't right.  This wasn't just a case of someone seeking shelter from the rain. This was someone who needed help, and he needed it now.


Against her better judgment, Amelia crossed the street.
