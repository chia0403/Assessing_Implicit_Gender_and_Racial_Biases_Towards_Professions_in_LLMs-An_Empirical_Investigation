The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice Amelia Thistlewick's head like a swarm of impatient wasps, mirroring her own mounting anxiety.  Outside, March rain lashed against the windows of her tiny office on Main Street, drumming a relentless rhythm that echoed the frantic tapping of her fingers against the keyboard. It was the last week before tax season officially closed, and Beatrice was drowning in forms. Every chair in her waiting room was occupied, each person a miniature mountain of paperwork representing weeks (or sometimes months) of procrastination.  

Beatrice longed for the calm solitude of autumn, when the leaves turned vibrant shades of orange and crimson outside her window, and the only sounds she heard were the rustling of papers and the quiet click-clack of her calculator. But now, it was a battle against deadlines, temperamental software, and the occasional tax fraud attempt.  Tonight, Beatrice had vowed to work late, fueled by lukewarm coffee and sheer willpower, to make sure she could meet her clients' needs and somehow, miraculously, keep her sanity intact.
