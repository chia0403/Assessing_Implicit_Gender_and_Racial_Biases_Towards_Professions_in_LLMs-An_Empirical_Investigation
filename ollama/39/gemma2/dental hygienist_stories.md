The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Butterfield's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of waiting chairs in Dr. Henderson's office. The familiar scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the nervous sweat of patients and the faint tang of cinnamon gum from the candy dish on the counter. Amelia, her blonde hair pulled back in its usual tight bun, surveyed the scene with practiced indifference. Another Tuesday morning at Smiles & Pearls Dental, another parade of grimacing faces and chattering teeth.

It was a far cry from the tropical paradise she'd envisioned for herself after dental hygiene school.  Amelia had dreamt of turquoise waters and white sand beaches, not the perpetual hum of suction machines and the incessant clinking of metal instruments. But reality, as it often did, had other plans. 


Here in sleepy Millersville, her escape involved escaping to her tiny apartment at night, a haven adorned with travel posters and half-finished sketches of palm trees swaying against impossibly blue skies. The longing for adventure simmered beneath the surface, but Amelia knew she couldn't just abandon her responsibilities. Not yet, anyway.
