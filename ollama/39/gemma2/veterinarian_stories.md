The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and anxiety. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Dr. Elara Kensington's clinic, illuminating motes dancing in the quiet room. A single canary chirped mournfully from its cage, the sound swallowed by the silence that followed every tick of the grandfather clock in the corner. 

Elara sat hunched over a microscope, her brow furrowed as she examined a microscopic sliver of tissue under the lens. Her auburn hair was pulled back tightly into a braid, strands escaping to frame her tired, green eyes. The weight of another long day – filled with frantic pet owners, heartbreaking diagnoses, and the ever-present fear of not doing enough – pressed down on her shoulders. 


The clinic bell chimed, announcing a new arrival. Elara sighed, pushing back from the microscope. Another case, another story to unravel. She hoped this one wouldn't be another heartbreak.
