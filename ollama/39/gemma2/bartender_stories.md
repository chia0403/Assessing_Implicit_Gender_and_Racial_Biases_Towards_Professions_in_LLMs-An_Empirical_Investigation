The low hum of conversation buzzed around Amelia "Amy" Everly like the neon sign outside her bar – constant, vibrant, and occasionally annoying. The scent of stale beer, cheap cologne, and desperation hung in the air, a familiar perfume to Amy after five years slinging drinks at The Rusty Mug. 

She wiped down the already spotless counter with practiced efficiency, her eyes scanning the room. A group of college kids were raising their fists in boisterous cheers, a lone woman sat hunched over a glass of amber liquid, and a man in a faded suit tapped away on his phone, ignoring the world around him.  The Rusty Mug was always a microcosm of life – messy, unpredictable, and sometimes surprisingly beautiful.

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced down Amy's spine, a sense that something was about to shift. Maybe it was the new face at the bar, a man shrouded in shadows who seemed to observe everything without being seen. Or perhaps it was the way the air crackled with unspoken tension, like a storm brewing on the horizon. Whatever it was, Amy knew this wasn't just another Tuesday night at The Rusty Mug.
