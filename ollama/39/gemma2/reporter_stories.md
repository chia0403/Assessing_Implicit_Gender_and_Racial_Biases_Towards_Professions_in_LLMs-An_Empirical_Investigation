Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Comet's newsroom, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia Beatrice Finch.  She hunched over her desk, tapping furiously at her keyboard, the pale glow of her monitor reflecting in her tired eyes. Outside, the city of Veridian was drowning in a deluge that rivaled Noah's flood, its neon lights blurred and shimmering through the downpour. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. 

Amelia, known to some as “Amy” but always “Miss Finch” by her editor, had been chasing this story for weeks. A whisper in the shadows, a rumour amongst the city's underbelly – an elusive organization called "The Obsidian Hand" was pulling strings from behind the scenes, manipulating Veridian's politicians and businesses alike. 

Her editor dismissed it as "local conspiracy theory," but Amy knew better. She'd felt the tremors of their influence, seen the coded messages in seemingly innocuous news clippings, heard the hushed whispers in dimly lit alleys. Tonight, she was finally going to uncover the truth. The source had contacted her through a burner phone – a single message: "Meet me at the abandoned lighthouse. Midnight." 


Veridian's infamous lighthouse, perched precariously on the edge of the storm-battered cliffs, was as much a legend as it was a landmark. Abandoned decades ago after a devastating storm claimed the lives of its last keeper, it stood shrouded in mist and rumour. A perfect meeting place for shadowy figures and whispered secrets.
