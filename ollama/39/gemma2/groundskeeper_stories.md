The morning mist clung to the emerald lawns of Oakhaven Manor like a shy child clinging to its mother's skirts. Dewdrops, glittering like scattered jewels, adorned every blade of grass, reflecting the pale light filtering through the ancient oaks that lined the propertyâ€™s perimeter. 

Bartholomew Percival "Bart" Greenthumb squinted at the rising sun, its rays just beginning to pierce the morning haze.

Forty-two years tending to Oakhaven's sprawling grounds had taken their toll on his aging body, but the familiar ache was a comforting reminder of a life well lived, a life dedicated to nurturing beauty from the earth.  


He adjusted the worn leather strap of his gardening hat, its brim shading his sun-weathered face, and surveyed his domain. This morning, like every morning, felt different. He couldn't quite place it, but an unsettling tension hummed beneath the idyllic tranquility.
