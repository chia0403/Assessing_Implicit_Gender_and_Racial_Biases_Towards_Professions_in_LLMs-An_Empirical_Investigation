The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's desk.  Her fingers danced across the keyboard, lines of code cascading down the screen like digital rain. Outside her window, the city throbbed with life, but inside the cramped cubicle, it was just her and the labyrinthine systems of OmniCorp's online retail platform. 

Amelia wasn't one for the mundane, yet she found a strange solace in the predictability of code. Every line had its purpose, every function its place. It was a puzzle to be solved, a symphony of logic waiting to be conducted.  But tonight, the usual hum of order felt off-key. A rogue error message blinked insistently, defying Amelia's attempts to decipher it. This wasn't just a glitch; this was something... different.


The setting is OmniCorp's bustling headquarters in Chicago, a glass and steel monolith that seemed to pierce the stormy night sky.  Amelia works late, her only company the flickering glow of computer monitors and the distant clatter of keystrokes from other overworked analysts.
