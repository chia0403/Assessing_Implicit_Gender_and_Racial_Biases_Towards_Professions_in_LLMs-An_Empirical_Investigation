The bell above the door chimed its usual jaunty tune as Amelia Beatrice Butterfield adjusted her headset microphone, forcing a smile onto her face despite the dull ache in her lower back from hours hunched over the reception desk.  

Amelia's world was contained within the four walls of Dr. Eleanor Vance's holistic wellness clinic, a pastel-hued haven amidst the grey bustle of downtown Chicago. It smelled faintly of lavender and sandalwood, and soothing instrumental music played softly over the speakers.  Through the large glass windows, Amelia could see the bustling street scene – yellow cabs weaving through traffic, pedestrians rushing to their destinations, skyscrapers piercing the overcast sky. But here, in the calming embrace of Dr. Vance's clinic, the world outside seemed miles away. 

She glanced at her clock: 2:47 pm. Just a few minutes until her lunch break, and she was already dreaming of a steaming bowl of ramen from the street vendor across the street. But first, she had to get through the afternoon rush – the usual influx of patients seeking solace from the city's relentless energy.  

Amelia leaned back in her ergonomically designed chair (which, ironically, wasn't doing much for her aching back), and took a deep breath, bracing herself for whatever came next.
