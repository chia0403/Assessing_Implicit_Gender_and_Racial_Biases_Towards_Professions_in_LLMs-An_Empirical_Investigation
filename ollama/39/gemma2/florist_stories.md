The bell above the door tinkled its melancholic tune as Iris Willowbrook straightened a drooping sunflower, her brow furrowing in concentration. Outside, the Seattle sky was the color of bruised plums, mirroring the mood settling over her shop, "Blooming Whispers." It was late November, the day after Thanksgiving, and the usual post-holiday rush had yet to materialize.  

Iris, usually an effervescent beacon of floral cheer, felt a sliver of worry tugging at her heartstrings. The last few months had been tough. Rent had skyrocketed, competition from online retailers was fierce, and even the loyal customers who frequented Blooming Whispers seemed hesitant to spend. She glanced at the wilting sunflowers, their once vibrant faces now drooping in defeat, a reflection of her own anxieties. 


As she reached for a watering can, the bell chimed again, announcing the arrival of a customer. Iris straightened, forcing a smile, and turned towards the newcomer, ready to spin tales of vibrant lilies and fragrant roses, even if it was just to herself.
