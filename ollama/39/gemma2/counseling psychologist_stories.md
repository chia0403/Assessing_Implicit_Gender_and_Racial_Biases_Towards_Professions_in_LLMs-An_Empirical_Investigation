Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Anya Hayes' office, blurring the cityscape outside into an impressionistic watercolor. The rhythmic drumming on glass mirrored the anxiety churning in her gut. She hadn't seen this kind of dread in a client since... well, since she couldn't remember.  

The waiting room, usually filled with the quiet murmur of anxieties and hopes, was deserted save for the flickering lamp beside the worn armchair where Daniel sat. He fidgeted, his knuckles bone-white against the smooth armrest, his eyes fixed on the scuffed linoleum floor. He hadn't spoken since she ushered him in five minutes ago.

Eleanor took a deep breath, smoothing down her cardigan and steeling herself. This was what she signed up for â€“ to be a beacon of calm in a storm, a safe harbor for those lost at sea. She just hoped, with a rising tremor of doubt, that she wouldn't lose them both tonight. 


 **Setting:** A rainy Wednesday evening in a mid-sized city, nestled between the bustle of the downtown core and the quiet residential areas. The counseling psychologist's office is located on the second floor of a brick building, overlooking a street perpetually under construction. Inside, the waiting room is small and book-lined, with worn furniture that speaks to years of shared stories and anxieties.
