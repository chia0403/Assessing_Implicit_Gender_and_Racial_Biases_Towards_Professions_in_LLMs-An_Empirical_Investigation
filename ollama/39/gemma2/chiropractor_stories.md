The insistent clinking of Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright’s antique coffee grinder cut through the pre-dawn silence of her seaside town. Seagulls cried in response, their raucous calls echoing off the weathered shingles of the Victorian houses lining Beach Street. Evelyn glanced out the window of her modest practice, “Cartwright Chiropractic & Wellness,” a plume of pale lavender mist rising from the churning Atlantic. The air smelled of salt and brine, a scent that always invigorated her.

Evelyn carefully poured the ground coffee into her French press, savoring the earthy aroma.  The sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, casting long, orange shadows across the sand. A new day on Gull Island promised a familiar rhythm: adjustments for stressed tourists, consultations with weathered fishermen complaining of crick necks, and the occasional bewildered local convinced their bunions were caused by faulty alignment of their toes. 

It wasn't always this serene. The past few weeks had been anything but calm.  A string of unexplained occurrences had shaken Gull Island to its core – disappearances, strange lights in the sky, whispers of ancient curses. And now, a new patient was due to arrive - a renowned astrophysicist with claims so outlandish they bordered on madness. Evelyn took a deep breath, her gaze lingering on the antique stethoscope hanging on the wall, a reminder that sometimes, even the most rational explanations couldn't account for everything.
