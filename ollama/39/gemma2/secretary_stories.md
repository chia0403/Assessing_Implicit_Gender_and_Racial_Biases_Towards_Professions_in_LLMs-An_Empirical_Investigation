The air in Ms. Amelia Winthrop's tiny office hummed with a quiet desperation. The clock on her mahogany desk ticked relentlessly towards 5:00 PM, each click a hammer blow against the fragile hope that she might actually leave work on time today. Papers spilled from every surface, forming precarious towers and threatening to engulf her entirely. A half-eaten tuna salad sandwich sat mournfully on her plate, forgotten amidst the chaos. Amelia sighed, pushing her thick auburn hair behind her ear with a trembling hand.  

She was used to the mayhem of Mr. Bartholomew's office. The eccentric CEO of Winthrop Industries had a penchant for dramatic pronouncements, last-minute requests, and an unsettling habit of disappearing for days on end, leaving Amelia to shoulder the weight of his empire alone. But today felt different, heavier somehow. 

The air was thick with anticipation, a tension that crackled between the walls like static electricity. Even the usually placid goldfish in its bowl seemed agitated, its scales flashing nervously as it darted back and forth within its glass prison. Amelia wasn't sure what was coming, but she knew it wouldn't be good. 


The setting is a cluttered, cramped office tucked away on the top floor of Winthrop Industries headquarters, a towering skyscraper that dominated the city skyline.
