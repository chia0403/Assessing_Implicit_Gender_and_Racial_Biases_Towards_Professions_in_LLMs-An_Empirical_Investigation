Here's a potential story opening and setting for a thriller or mystery novel:

---

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, shrouding the streets of downtown Richmond in a gloomy mist. Inside the stately brick building that housed the Richmond Courthouse, Judge Emilia Adelaide Wellington stood at the edge of her polished mahogany bench, surveying the crowd with an air of detachment. Her piercing blue eyes, rimmed with a fine network of wrinkles, seemed to bore into the souls of those gathered before her.

At sixty-five, Judge Wellington was a fixture in the community, respected for her fairness and razor-sharp mind. A product of the city's elite, she had graduated at the top of her class from the University of Virginia Law School, where her sharp intellect and quick wit had earned her both academic accolades and a reputation as a formidable debater.

Over the years, Wellington had presided over countless trials, earning a reputation for being unyielding in her pursuit of justice. Her imposing presence – a commanding figure with silver hair and a stern expression – commanded attention, even when she was delivering a ruling that was unpopular with one or more of the parties involved.

But today, as the rain drummed against the courthouse windows like a cadaver's heartbeat, Judge Wellington felt a growing sense of unease. Something about this trial, which pitted a young black woman named Maya Thompson against her estranged father, felt off-kilter. A nagging sense that she had overlooked something crucial – something that would come back to haunt her.

As the courtroom fell silent once more, Wellington steepled her fingers and fixed her gaze on the two litigants before her. It was time to get this trial underway, no matter how foreboding the atmosphere seemed.
