Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement outside, casting a gaudy glow over the small, cramped bar that was "McGinty's Tavern". Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer and worn leather, and the sounds of Sinatra and the occasional argument between patrons filled the air. Behind the bar, bartender Declan Patrick McSweeney polished a mug with a white apron, his eyes scanning the room for trouble as he waited on his regulars.

It was a chilly autumn evening in New Haven, Connecticut, and McGinty's was one of the few places that still catered to the locals who called this rough-around-the-edges town home. Declan had worked here for five years, pouring drinks and listening to stories from the patrons who came and went like the wind. He knew everyone's name, except for a handful of newcomers who seemed to pop up every now and then like the sun in the morning sky.

As he wiped down the bar with a dirty rag, Declan couldn't shake the feeling that something was off tonight. The regulars were all accounted for, but there was an undercurrent of tension in the air that made his skin prickle. It started with whispers and glances, and grew louder as the night wore on. Whatever it was, Declan knew he'd be at the center of it, behind the bar where he could keep a close eye on everyone and everything.

And just as he was starting to relax back into his routine, the door swung open and a stranger walked in, their eyes scanning the room like they were looking for something - or someone.
