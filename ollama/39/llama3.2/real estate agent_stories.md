Here's a potential story opening:

As she stood on the worn wooden dock, gazing out at the mist-shrouded lake that stretched out before her like a canvas of emerald and sapphire hues, Evelyn Rae Jenkins couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The once-quaint town of Willow Creek, where she'd spent countless summers as a child exploring the woods and playing in the water, now seemed...different. The sun was setting over the lake, casting long shadows across the deserted streets and illuminating the for-sale signs that lined the highway like a macabre welcome mat.

Evelyn Rae, or Evie to those who knew her, had always been drawn to real estate. She'd inherited the business from her father, a successful agent in his own right, and had spent years building a reputation as one of the top agents in the county. But lately, she'd found herself feeling restless, like there was something more out there for her than just selling houses to happy families.

As she breathed in the cool evening air, Evelyn's mind began to wander back to the letter she'd received that morning from her estranged brother, James. He'd moved back to Willow Creek a few weeks ago, after years of living abroad, and had reached out to her with an offer: meet him at the old family cabin on the lake, where their father used to take them fishing when they were kids, and discuss the future of Jenkins Real Estate.

Evelyn's instincts told her that this was more than just a friendly family gathering. Something was brewing in Willow Creek, and she had a feeling that she was about to be right at the center of it all.
