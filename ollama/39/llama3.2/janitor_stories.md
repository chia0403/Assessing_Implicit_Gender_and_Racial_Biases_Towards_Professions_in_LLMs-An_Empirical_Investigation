Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the deserted corridors of Ravenswood High School, the once-thriving hub of teenage life now reduced to a mere shadow of its former self. The halls were eerily quiet, save for the soft hum of the cleaning carts that wheeled across the polished floors, their contents whirring softly as they collected the detritus of another day.

Among them was Edwin Jenson "EJ" Thompson, a janitor with a keen eye for detail and a penchant for observing the smallest imperfections in the worn linoleum. He had been working at Ravenswood High for over five years, watching generations of students come and go as he diligently swept, mopped, and scrubbed his way through the school's endless expanse of classrooms, hallways, and lockers.

As EJ pushed his cart to the next room, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the dusty corners and abandoned textbooks; it was a nagging sense of unease that had been growing in the pit of his stomach since morning. Little did he know, today would be no ordinary day at Ravenswood High.

How's this opening?
