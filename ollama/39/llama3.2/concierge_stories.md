Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The snowflakes danced in the flickering candlelight, casting a mesmerizing waltz on the polished marble floor of the Grand Hotel's lobby. It was Christmas Eve, 1922, and the air was alive with the whispers of holiday magic.

Amidst the bustle of revelers, one figure stood still, her piercing green eyes scanning the room with an air of quiet dedication. Her name was Adelaide "Addie" LaRue, a consummate concierge at the esteemed Grand Hotel. With her razor-sharp mind and quick wit, she had earned a reputation among the hotel's discerning guests as the go-to problem solver and confidante.

As Addie expertly juggled the demands of her high-maintenance clientele, her thoughts strayed to the mysterious letter she had received earlier that day. The note, penned in elegant script on a cream-colored envelope, bore no return address but contained only two cryptic words: "Come home." Addie's curiosity was piqued, and as she began to clear a path through the throngs of partygoers, her gaze lingered on the letter, a silent promise of adventure beckoning just beyond the horizon.
