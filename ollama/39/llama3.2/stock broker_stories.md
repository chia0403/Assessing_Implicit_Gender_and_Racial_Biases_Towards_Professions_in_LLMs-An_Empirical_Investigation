Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the Manhattan skyline reflected off the polished chrome of the luxury skyscraper where Harrison Grant Wellington III, investment banker and stock broker extraordinaire, sat sipping his scotch on the rocks at the penthouse bar.

It was a chilly autumn evening in October 2023, and the rain-soaked streets below seemed to stretch on forever, a seemingly endless expanse of dark glass and steel that seemed to swallow up the city's secrets. The hum of the air conditioning units and the muted chatter of the other patrons created a soothing background noise that allowed Harrison to focus on his phone screen.

As he scrolled through his Bloomberg feed, Harrison's eyes narrowed at the sudden drop in market value of his most prized investment: NovaTech, a cutting-edge tech firm that had been making waves in the industry with its revolutionary new AI software. The numbers were flashing red, and Harrison could feel his gut knotting with anxiety.

Just as he was about to send an email to his broker to try and stem the bleeding, the bar's bartender slid him another whiskey, and Harrison raised an eyebrow at the friendly gesture. It was going to be one of those nights, he thought, as he set his glass down and gazed out the window at the city below, feeling like the king of Wall Street but secretly trembling with uncertainty.
