Here's a story opening and setting:

The rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Sofia Elizabeth Rodriguez's office, casting a rhythmic melody that seemed to match the beat of her own weary heart. It was a sound she'd grown all too familiar with in recent weeks, as the small coastal town of Ravenswood struggled to cope with the aftermath of the devastating storm that had ravaged its shores just a fortnight prior.

Sofia, a successful and respected surgeon in her late thirties, had returned to her hometown of Ravenswood after a decade away, seeking solace and a fresh start. Her parents still lived in the same small house on Elm Street where she'd grown up, surrounded by the familiar sights and sounds of her childhood.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee and stared out into the rain-soaked streets, Sofia's mind wandered to the long list of patients waiting for her attention at the Ravenswood Hospital. The storm had left a trail of destruction in its wake, and the medical staff was stretched thin trying to meet the demand for care.

Sofia's thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of her trusty nurse, Rachel Jenkins, who burst into the office with a look of urgency on her face. "Dr. Rodriguez, we've got a code blue in room 304," she said, her voice low and serious.
