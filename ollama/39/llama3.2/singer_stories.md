Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit alleyway behind the famous Starlight Theatre was always bustling with activity, but on this particular night, it was eerily quiet. The only sound was the distant hum of the theatre's neon sign, which cast a gaudy glow over the crowded streets of Hollywood Boulevard.

Inside the theatre, Aurora "Rory" Evergreen, lead singer of the indie-rock band "Electric Storm," stood backstage, fidgeting with her guitar strings as she waited for her cue to take the stage. The crowd had been buzzing all day, and Rory could feel their energy coursing through her veins like adrenaline.

As she adjusted her mic stand and took a deep breath, Rory's mind wandered back to the mysterious package that had arrived at the theatre earlier that evening. It was a small, unmarked box with no return address, but inside, she'd found a cryptic message scrawled on a piece of black paper: "The spotlight will shine brighter than you ever thought possible."

Rory shivered at the ominous words, feeling a shiver run down her spine as she wondered who could have sent them and what they meant. She pushed the thoughts aside, focusing instead on the performance ahead â€“ but as she stepped out onto the stage and into the spotlight, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The crowd erupted into cheers as Rory launched into the opening chords of her hit song "Lightning in a Bottle," but as she began to sing, she felt an unsettling sense of disconnection from the music itself. It was as if someone or something had taken hold of the performance, using it to channel a dark and ancient power that threatened to consume her whole.

And then, just as Rory was hitting her stride, everything went black.
