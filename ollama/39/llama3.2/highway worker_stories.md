Here's a potential story opening and setting for a thriller novel:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of Route 66, casting a pale glow over the deserted asphalt. Highway worker Axel Ryder Jensen stood at the edge of the road, his reflective vest a deep shade of orange that seemed to glow in the pre-dawn light. The wind whipped through his dark brown hair as he squinted out at the endless stretch of highway, his eyes scanning for any sign of trouble.

Axel had worked on this stretch of road for over five years, and he knew every inch of it like the back of his hand. But despite his familiarity with the terrain, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The roads were always quiet at dawn, but today there seemed to be a sense of anticipation in the air - a feeling that something was waiting just beyond the horizon.

As he checked his tools and equipment for what felt like the hundredth time, Axel's mind began to wander back to the strange phone call he'd received last night. The voice on the other end had been distorted and menacing, with an accent that Axel couldn't quite place. "You're getting too close," the voice had said. "Back off while you still can."

Axel shivered, despite the warmth of the morning sun. He knew that he was taking a risk by investigating the strange occurrences on his route - but something about this felt different. Something that made him want to dig deeper and uncover the truth.

Little did Axel know, the truth would be more sinister than he could ever have imagined...
