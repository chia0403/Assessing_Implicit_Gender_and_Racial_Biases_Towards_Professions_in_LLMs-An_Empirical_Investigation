Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dim glow of the instrument panel illuminated Captain Atlas Ryder Jackson's weathered face as he banked the small charter plane to the left, the engines roaring in response to his gentle touch on the controls. The vast expanse of the Arizona desert stretched out before him, a sea of golden sand and rocky outcroppings that seemed to shimmer like diamonds in the fading light of day.

As he flew over the rugged terrain, the pilot couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had been growing inside him for weeks. It was as if he'd stumbled into something he wasn't meant to see, a secret that someone had gone to great lengths to keep hidden. And now, with the mysterious message on his phone still burning in his mind - "Meet me at the old lighthouse at midnight" - Captain Atlas Ryder Jackson knew that his life was about to take a drastic turn.

The small plane, a Cessna 172 named "Bertha," banked and turned once more, following the contours of the desert landscape as it made its way towards the small town of Red Rock. It was a place he'd known for years, a refuge from the dangers and uncertainties that lurked in the skies above. But tonight, something felt different. Tonight, Captain Jackson had a feeling that his life would never be the same again.
