Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As a bookkeeper for the local antique shop, "Curios and Antiques," Emilia spent most of her days surrounded by dusty relics and forgotten memories. But tonight, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quiet streets, Emilia felt an inexplicable restlessness.

As Emilia took a deep breath and stepped into the downpour, she couldn't shake the feeling that this quiet evening was about to become anything but ordinary.
