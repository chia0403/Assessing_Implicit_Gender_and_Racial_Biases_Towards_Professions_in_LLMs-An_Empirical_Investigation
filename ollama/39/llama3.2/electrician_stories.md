Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood City gleamed like polished steel as Jack Ethan Thompson stepped out of his small apartment and into the damp morning air. A 35-year-old licensed electrician with over ten years of experience under his belt, Jack had seen it all - from flickering fluorescent lights to blazing electrical fires that could reduce a building to ashes in an instant.

As he took a deep breath, the smell of rain and ozone filled his nostrils, and he felt a sense of comfort wash over him. He lived for days like this, when the world outside seemed to slow down and the only sound was the rhythmic beat of the raindrops on the pavement.

Jack's eyes scanned the street, taking in the rows of Victorian-era houses, each one adorned with intricate woodwork and ornate decorations that seemed frozen in time. He had spent countless hours working on these very streets, fixing broken circuitry, rewiring old wiring, and even installing new systems for homeowners who wanted to stay up-to-date.

Today was no exception. Jack had a job lined up at the local historic mansion, Ravenswood Manor, where he would be tasked with repairing the ancient electrical system that had been in place since the 1800s. It was a challenge he relished, and one that would put his skills to the test in ways he hadn't experienced before.

As he made his way towards the manor's grand entrance, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The mansion's normally immaculate facade seemed a bit...tarnished today, as if the rain had somehow seeped into the very fabric of its stone walls. And the front door, usually adorned with a gleaming brass knocker in the shape of a lion's head, was open - just a crack - as if waiting for him.

A shiver ran down Jack's spine as he pushed open the door and stepped inside. He had a feeling that this job was going to be more than just a simple repair...
