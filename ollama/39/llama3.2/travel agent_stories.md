Here's a potential story opening:

As she gazed out the rain-soaked window of her small office, Emily Joy Thompson couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over her. The dimly lit room was filled with the familiar scent of old maps and dusty globes, a comforting reminder of the countless adventures she'd helped plan for her clients over the years. But as she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Emily's mind wandered to her own bucket list - one that had been gathering dust since her last big trip to Japan three years ago.

Located in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon, Emily's travel agency, "Wanderlust & Co.", was a cozy haven for those seeking inspiration and expert guidance on their next journey. The walls were adorned with framed postcards, vintage suitcases, and colorful brochures from far-flung destinations around the world. It was here that Emily spent most of her days, pouring over itineraries, making recommendations, and watching her clients' faces light up as they planned their dream trips.

Despite her successful business, Emily felt a pang of wanderlust herself - a yearning to break free from the routine and explore the world beyond the Pacific Northwest. As she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time that morning, Emily's gaze drifted back to the rain-soaked streets outside, where the sound of umbrellas and splashing puddles created a soothing melody that seemed to whisper: "It's time, Em... it's time."

This opening sets the scene for a story that could explore themes of travel, adventure, and self-discovery, as Emily navigates her own desires and the challenges of running a successful business.
