Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Tokyo glistened like polished onyx as Kaito Yamato stepped out of the neon-lit office building, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks for any sign of life. As a top-performing salesperson at the prestigious Japanese technology firm, NeuroSpark Inc., Kaito had spent countless late nights and early mornings peddling their revolutionary brain-computer interface to skeptical CEOs and cash-hungry venture capitalists.

With a worn leather briefcase clutched tightly in his hand, Kaito navigated the throngs of pedestrians with an air of practiced confidence, his tailored suit and slicked-back hair giving him an almost otherworldly aura. He hailed a taxi, and as they sped through the city's chaotic streets, Kaito's mind began to wander to the impending meeting at the high-stakes tech conference in Osaka – the one that could make or break his career.

The year was 2025, and the world of artificial intelligence had reached a fever pitch. NeuroSpark Inc.'s latest innovation, codenamed "Echo," promised to revolutionize the way humans interacted with technology by reading and writing brain signals. But as Kaito knew all too well, the real challenge lay not in selling the product itself, but in convincing his clients that this revolutionary tech was worth the risk of disrupting their entire business models.

As the taxi pulled up to the conference center, Kaito felt a familiar mix of excitement and trepidation. This was it – his chance to prove himself as more than just another salesperson; to secure a spot among the pantheon of AI visionaries who would shape the future of humanity. Little did he know, however, that this meeting would also be his last chance at redemption.
