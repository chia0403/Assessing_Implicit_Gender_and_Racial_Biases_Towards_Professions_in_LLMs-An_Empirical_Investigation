Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The dimly lit workshop was a maze of twisting pipes, hissing valves, and the faint scent of soldering metal. Amidst the chaos, Aur√©lien "Ren" LaFleur moved with practiced ease, his hands deftly guiding the drafting software on his workstation as he worked to finalize the plans for the latest project. As a skilled drafting worker at the esteemed engineering firm, LaFleur & Co., Ren was responsible for bringing the designs of the company's visionary engineers to life.

The year was 1922, and the city of New Orleans was abuzz with the promise of progress and innovation. The great Mississippi River had long been the lifeblood of the city, but as the population grew and the need for modern infrastructure increased, so did the demand for talented draftsmen like Ren. With his keen eye for detail and talent for translating complex ideas into precise blueprints, Ren was in high demand.

As he worked, the soft hum of machinery and the occasional shout from a coworker created a lively background noise that was both familiar and comforting to Ren. He had spent countless hours within these walls, perfecting his craft and honing his skills, and he knew every nook and cranny of this workshop by heart.

But despite his familiarity with the space, Ren couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside him for days, ever since he'd stumbled upon a cryptic message in the company's engineering files. Now, as he worked to meet the demanding deadlines set by his boss, Ren couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary world.
