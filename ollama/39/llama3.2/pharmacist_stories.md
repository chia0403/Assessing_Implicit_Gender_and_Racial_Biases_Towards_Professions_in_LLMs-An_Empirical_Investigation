Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn crept over the small town of Willow Creek like a damp shroud, casting a gloomy veil over the streets and homes that slumbered quietly in their morning beds. In the midst of this sleepy rural landscape, the Willow Creek Pharmacy stood as a beacon of warmth and life - its bright yellow facade and cheerful sign a stark contrast to the grayness outside.

Inside the pharmacy, pharmacist Emily Elizabeth Rose Jenkins stirred the last remaining embers of her morning coffee, watching as they dissolved into nothingness in the empty cup. It was 5:45 AM on a chilly winter morning, and the streets were still deserted except for the occasional passing truck or early riser hurrying to start their day.

Emily took a deep breath, feeling the familiar scent of disinfectant and medicinal herbs fill her lungs as she gazed out at the quiet town. She loved mornings like this - just her, the pharmacy, and the promise of another day spent helping people find relief from their ailments. But today felt different. Today, Emily couldn't shake the sense that something was off in Willow Creek.

As she began to prep for the day's customers, a faint feeling of unease crept over her, like a whispered warning in the back of her mind. She pushed it aside, attributing it to the lingering effects of a difficult night's sleep. But as she made her way to the counter to start prepping for the morning rush, her eyes caught on a small piece of paper slipped under the pharmacy door - an anonymous note that read: "The poison is coming".
