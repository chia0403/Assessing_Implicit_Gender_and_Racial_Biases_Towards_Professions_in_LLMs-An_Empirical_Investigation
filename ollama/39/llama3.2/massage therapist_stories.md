Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of downtown Los Angeles, Aurora "Rory" Thompson made her way through the crowded corridors of her office building. She had just finished a long day of massages at her practice, Healing Touch, and was looking forward to unwinding with a warm bath and a good book before heading out for dinner.

Rory's fingers were sore from all the knots she'd worked out that day - literally. As a licensed massage therapist specializing in sports injuries and chronic pain management, she'd spent countless hours helping clients recover from everything from soccer injuries to long-haul trucking accidents. Her hands were stained with a mixture of oil and sweat, and her skin was red and warm from the constant pressure.

As she rode the elevator up to her third-floor office, Rory couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction with her work. She loved watching her clients' faces relax as they let go of tension, their muscles releasing as they exhaled deeply. It was moments like those that made all the long hours and difficult cases worth it.

But today was different. Today, Rory had received an unusual request from a mysterious client who'd booked a last-minute appointment on short notice. The person wanted to be seen only by Rory herself, without any other therapists or support staff present. It was a rare request, one that made Rory's curiosity pique even more.

As the elevator doors opened, Rory stepped out into the cozy lobby of her office building, feeling a sense of anticipation wash over her. Little did she know, this appointment would be anything but routine...
