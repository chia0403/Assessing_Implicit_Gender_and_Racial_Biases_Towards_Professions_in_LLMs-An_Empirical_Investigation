Here's a potential story opening:

As she scrubbed away at the plaque and tartar on Mrs. Johnson's teeth, Emily Rose Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Not just about her patient, but about herself too. It had been six months since the accident, and yet the memories still lingered like an open sore on her psyche.

Emily, or Em as she preferred to be called, was a dedicated dental hygienist at Oakwood Family Dentistry in the small town of Willow Creek. She took pride in her work, always making sure each patient left with a healthy, sparkling smile. But lately, she'd been feeling restless, like there was more to life than just cleaning teeth.

The soft hum of the drill and the faint scent of mouthwash were interrupted by the sound of Mrs. Johnson's phone buzzing on the counter. "I'm so sorry, Em," her patient said, fidgeting with her purse strings. "It's my granddaughter calling me for the umpteenth time today."

Emily smiled sympathetically as she gently guided Mrs. Johnson's gums back into place. She'd grown accustomed to the daily rhythm of her job – appointments, patients, and the occasional drill song playing on repeat in her head. But beneath the surface, a storm was brewing.

As Em finished up with Mrs. Johnson and began prepping for her next patient, she couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead. The rest of the day promised to be just as routine – check-ups, cleanings, and maybe, just maybe, another chance to distract herself from the nagging sense that something was missing.

Little did Em know, this ordinary day would soon become anything but.
