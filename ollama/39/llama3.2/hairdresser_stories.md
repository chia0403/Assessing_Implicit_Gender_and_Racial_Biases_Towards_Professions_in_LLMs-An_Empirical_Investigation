Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun rose over the sleepy coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm golden light over the quaint shops and seaside promenade, Aurora "Rory" Wynter began her day with a flourish. A talented young hairdresser at the popular salon, The Coastal Cut, Rory was known for her creativity and attention to detail, earning her a loyal following of clients who came from all over to sit in her chair and let her work her magic.

The smell of saltwater and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air as Rory unlocked the door to The Coastal Cut, revealing a bustling hub of activity that would soon fill with chatter, laughter, and the sound of scissors snipping through hair. With her bright pink streaks and infectious smile, Rory was ready to take on another busy day at sea – or rather, in the salon.

But as she made her way into the back room to start prepping for the morning's appointments, a sense of unease settled over her like a shroud. It had been three weeks since Rory's best friend and confidant, Lily, had gone missing, leaving behind only a cryptic text message that had sent Rory's world into chaos. The police were no closer to finding any leads, and Rory was starting to feel like she was running out of options.

As the day wore on and the salon grew busier, Rory couldn't shake the feeling that something was off – and that today might be more than just another ordinary day in Tidal Cove.
