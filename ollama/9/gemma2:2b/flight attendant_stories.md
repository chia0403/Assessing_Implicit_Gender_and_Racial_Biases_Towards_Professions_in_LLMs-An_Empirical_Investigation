The stale air in the galley hung heavy like forgotten dreams, punctuated by the rhythmic clink of stainless steel utensils against porcelain plates.  Amelia "Amy" Hayes, her uniform neatly ironed as always but feeling too stiff under the weight of the cabin's anxieties, hovered over a lukewarm breakfast tray. The setting sun bled orange and pink across the window, casting long shadows onto the faces of passengers slowly dozing off in their seats. 

A young boy, barely five years old with bright, tear-filled eyes, sat in the corner of the galley, his face buried in a crumpled tissue. His mother, weary and worn down like an overused plane engine, was slumped against the wall, trying to soothe him as she watched Amy's hurried movements. This wasn't the usual humdrum routine of a late-night flight; tonight, something felt different. A tension clung to the air, thick with unspoken worry and hushed whispers about a storm brewing on the horizon that threatened to swallow them whole.
