Rain lashed against the windows of "The Daily Grind," blurring the neon sign proclaiming "Coffee & Comfort" into an erratic kaleidoscope of red and green.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Thorne hurried to stack another dozen boxes of pre-packaged muffins behind the counter, her usually tidy smile strained as she fought back a headache throbbing in sync with the downpour outside. The aroma of burnt coffee hung thick in the air, punctuated by the sharp tang of bleach from the cleaning cart rolling through the aisle.  

It was 2:00 pm on Tuesday, a day that felt perpetually stuck between the frantic energy of morning rush and the languid afternoon lull. Amy glanced at her watch, counting down the minutes until she clocked out and could escape this symphony of clattering mugs and murmuring customers.  But tonight wasn't another night where she was just 'on call.' Tonight, she had a delivery. 

A delivery from a mystery client with an ominous-sounding name: The Shadow Broker.
