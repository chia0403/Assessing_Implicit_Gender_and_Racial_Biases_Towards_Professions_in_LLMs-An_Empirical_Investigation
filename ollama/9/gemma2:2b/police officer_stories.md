Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Officer Michael "Mac" MacKenzie's patrol car, blurring the already dim streetlights into streaks of light and shadow. The air was thick with the scent of wet asphalt and diesel, clinging to Mac like an unwelcome layer of humidity. The beat he was assigned had a reputation for being rough - a melting pot of broken dreams, forgotten hopes, and whispered secrets in alleyways. He parked his car on Elm Street, its name ironic considering it seemed more like a concrete canyon than anything else.  

Mac adjusted his cap, the worn brim casting a shadow across his tired face. He was halfway through his third shift, and the relentless drizzle mirrored the storm brewing inside him. His partner, Detective Miller, had been called away for a domestic call; another one of their city's endless tragedies. Mac felt like a solitary island in this urban jungle, every street corner holding some silent story begging to be told.
