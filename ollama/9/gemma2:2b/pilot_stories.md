The salt spray stung Amelia’s face as she wrestled with the controls, her eyes squinting against the relentless assault of dawn. Above, the sky was a bruised canvas of purples and oranges, promising nothing but wind and turbulence. The small plane, nicknamed "Sea Serpent" by its quirky owner, creaked precariously beneath her. Amelia’s knuckles were white on the yoke as she maneuvered through the choppy air above the treacherous Alaskan coastline.  It was a place where mountains clawed at the sky, their summits veiled in mist, and glaciers carved deep into the earth's skin. This was the wild heart of Alaska, and this was Amelia’s domain - her love for it as fierce and untamed as the winds she fought against.

The last known coordinates of her friend and fellow pilot, James “Maverick” McTavish, led her to a remote research outpost in the unforgiving wilderness. Maverick, famed for his daring flights and unyielding spirit, had vanished without a trace days ago. His disappearance sparked a frantic search that Amelia had pledged to find answers to – no matter the cost.
