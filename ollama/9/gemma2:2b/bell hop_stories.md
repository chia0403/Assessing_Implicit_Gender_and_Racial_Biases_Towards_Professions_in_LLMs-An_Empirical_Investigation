## The Clock Strikes Twelve

**Setting:**  The Grand Astoria Hotel in Boston, 1920s. A sprawling, opulent hotel with grand staircases, marble halls, and ornate details that seem to whisper stories of bygone glamour. It was once the center of society in a city where fortunes were made and lost, but now it sat on the cusp of decline.

**Main Character:**  Elias Thorne, a man whose quiet efficiency belied a restlessness simmering beneath his crisp uniform and clean-cut demeanor. At 25 years old, he had risen from humble beginnings to become one of the most reliable bell hops in the city, but even with this seemingly secure job, he couldn't shake off a gnawing sense of unfulfillment.

**Opening:**  The insistent chime of the Grand Astoria’s central clock tower echoed through the hotel's grand lobby. Elias, his eyes fixed on the worn-down leather of the luggage cart he was pushing, let out a weary sigh as another late night descended upon him. He'd been tending to luggage all afternoon, a tedious task that seemed to lack any real purpose in the grand scheme of things.  Tonight though, something felt different. A distinct unease settled over Elias like a shroud. It started with a peculiar scent – a faint whiff of salt and seaweed - before it manifested as a series of cryptic letters scrawled on a crumpled note left behind in a guest’s room: “The clock strikes twelve... for the final bell. Don't forget the past, Elias.”   He knew he shouldn't pay much attention to these messages, but something about them resonated deep within him - an unsettling feeling of foreboding mixed with an almost desperate curiosity.  

As his eyes drifted towards the dusty fireplace, a flicker in the hearth sent chills down his spine. Was it just smoke and embers dancing on the dying flames? The last time he had seen this kind of light, his grandfather's stories about "The Sea of Souls" began to resurface, vivid as if pulled from a forgotten dream.
