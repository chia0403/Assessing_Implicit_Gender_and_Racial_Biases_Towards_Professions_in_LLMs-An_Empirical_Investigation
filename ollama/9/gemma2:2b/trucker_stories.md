The desert air hung heavy, thick with the scent of dust and burnt rubber.  Miles rolled by in endless waves of shimmering sand, punctuated only by the occasional scrub oak and the lonely wind whistling through the canyons. It was this kind of desolation that drove Bartholomew “Bart” Jackson to his truck, a hulking behemoth of chrome and diesel named "The Wanderer." Bart, with his weathered face and calloused hands, felt at home in its embrace.

He pulled into the desolate rest stop nestled against the edge of the Mojave, just long enough to snatch some stale coffee from the vending machine and refill his tank. As always, he found himself staring out at the endless expanse, a familiar ache settling in his chest.  It was like a curse – this feeling of being adrift in a sea of sand, never quite landing anywhere, never quite finding anything. But then again, maybe that's just what made it all feel so real. 

He shifted into gear, starting the engine of The Wanderer with a rumble that echoed the desert itself.  Bart was going to make his way north, across Nevada and into California. He just needed to find a place to lay down his load before sunrise. His route, however, wasn't a straight shot, not even close. It was a winding dance of miles, always shifting, always finding new twists.
