The scent of sugar and citrus hung heavy in the air, mixing with the faint aroma of woodsmoke from the outdoor grill where Chef Louis was tending to his smoker for the day's special – smoked salmon cakes. This was Magnolia Bakery at night, its usually cheerful façade now adorned with a single spotlight highlighting a mountain of frosted cupcakes stacked precariously on display tables. 

Inside, the normally bustling bakery was quiet tonight. The last customer had just left and the usual symphony of clattering trays and whirring mixers had died down, replaced by the rhythmic hum of the fluorescent lights overhead and the soft murmur of the evening breeze whistling through a loose window pane.  Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, her caramel curls escaping from their messy bun in wisps of cinnamon-laced air, surveyed the scene with a sigh. 

Tonight wasn't just any night. This was the first day she had dared to challenge her father, the legendary pastry chef and owner of Magnolia Bakery. Tonight was the night she would unveil her own cupcake designs for his renowned annual Sweet Harmony competition. It was her chance to prove that Amelia Hawthorne, not just "Amy", could be an artist in her own right.
