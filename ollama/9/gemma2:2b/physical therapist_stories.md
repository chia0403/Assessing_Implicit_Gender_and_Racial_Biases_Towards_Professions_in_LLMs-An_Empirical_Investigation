The salt air clung to Amelia's scrubs like an old sweater, clinging stubbornly to her face as she walked across the sand dunes.  A cool breeze rustled through the swaying grass, carrying with it the scent of sunbaked earth and distant pine forests. She squinted towards the azure horizon where the sky bled into the ocean, a stark contrast to the gritty grey concrete of the city she'd left behind. Amelia had traded in her worn-down office on Madison Avenue for this wild, windswept corner of the world—a small beach town nestled within an untamed stretch of California coastline. 

It wasn’t always this way.  Amelia used to be a woman defined by schedule and routine. A wife, a career in high-pressure rehabilitation at a renowned New York City hospital, and nights spent staring into empty eyes as she helped patients navigate the treacherous waters of their physical struggles. Now, her days revolved around long walks on the beach, sunrise yoga sessions, and the comforting rhythm of ocean waves.  But lately, even this escape was no longer enough. 

This was supposed to be a fresh start. A chance to reclaim her own life after years of pushing someone else’s dreams forward. But something about the silence echoed in the space between her work and home, a void she desperately tried to fill with every sunrise and every sunset.  She clutched the worn leather folder in her hands, its contents a jumbled mess of notes, charts, and names – all reminders of why she'd left it all behind. But sometimes, even looking at the pictures felt like running from herself.
