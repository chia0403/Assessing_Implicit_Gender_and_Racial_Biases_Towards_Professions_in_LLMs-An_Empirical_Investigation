The scent of sugar spun through the air, clinging like honey to the worn wooden beams of Elara's bakery. Sunlight dripped like melting chocolate through the dusty shopfront window, illuminating motes dancing in the dust that settled perpetually on everything, especially her heart.  Elara, known as "Lira" by regulars for her lilting voice and flour-dusted apron, wiped a smudge of cocoa off her cheek with the back of her hand. 

The town of Oakhaven nestled comfortably between rolling hills, its cobblestone streets lined with houses that looked like oversized gingerbread men. A constant drizzle painted the sky in shades of grey and lingered on the eaves of every building as Elara worked, the rhythmic hum of the old oven resonating in her ears.  But even these familiar sounds couldn't quite drown out the anxious fluttering in her stomach. 

A new batch of gingerbread cookies sat cooling, their ginger scent tinged with a hint of something unsettling - fear she couldn't place. Today was the annual Harvest Festival, and while Elara had always loved this time of year, filled as it was with the warmth of community and the sweet taste of pumpkin spice everything, a sense of dread clung to her like a damp blanket.  This year felt different, darker somehow.
