## The Setting: 

The early morning air hung thick and humid over the I-70 overpass, casting the asphalt in an almost oily sheen under the merciless glare of the sun.  Creosote smoke curled lazily from the welding torches as they worked on patching the rusted joints of the aging bridge. Miles stretched out before them, a ribbon of concrete and steel weaving its way through the sprawling suburbs, connecting bustling city life to quiet suburban life. 

## The Character:

The man's name was **Jeremiah "Jerry" O’Connell**, and he had been working on this overpass for the past three years.  Years that had seen his beard turn silver and his once youthful blue eyes turn a steely gray, reflecting the harshness of the work and the unforgiving sun. Jerry was a man built from hard edges, quiet and deliberate, with calloused hands and a stoic face that rarely cracked a smile. 

He stood back, surveying his worksite.  A half-finished patch lay on the ground, its metallic sheen promising a future life of silent service. A faint smell of burnt rubber and gasoline clung to him like an old friend. He lit another cigarette from a pack tucked into the pocket of his worn-out work jacket. The smoke, thin and gray, rose towards the sky before trailing away as he closed his eyes. 

Jerry was used to solitude.  The rhythmic drone of the machinery and the symphony of creaking steel provided him with company. He preferred it that way, his mind working in tandem with the hum of the highway’s veins – a quiet rhythm broken only by the sudden rush of traffic and the occasional shout from a passing truck driver.


**Opening:**

A screech of tires echoed through the stillness as a black sedan hurtled towards them. Jerry's eyes snapped open, his hand instinctively reaching for the pipe wrench at his side. A wave of nausea washed over him as he watched a figure emerge from the car: a woman dressed in an immaculate white suit, her face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat. Her lips moved, forming words that were barely audible above the roar of the engine. 

"The bridge..." she whispered, her voice husky and laced with fear, "it's... collapsing."
