## Opening

The smell of burnt coffee clung to Mr. Alistair Hawthorne's worn sweater as he surveyed his students.  He wasn’t exactly a morning person, but there was something about the stillness before the storm that held a certain melancholic beauty. It reminded him of composing an old-fashioned sonnet, his heart yearning for the rhythmic cadence and carefully chosen words. He adjusted his glasses, their lenses reflecting the dull grey light streaming through the classroom windows, and sighed inwardly. 

His students were an eclectic bunch:  the bubbly, perpetually anxious Sarah; the brooding, artistic Lucas; the quiet genius, Maya; and Liam, whose charm was as fleeting as a summer breeze.  Mr. Hawthorne's year of teaching English at Westford High hadn't exactly gone according to plan. The usual teenage rebellion had been replaced by an unsettling silence, punctuated only by the occasional discordant note from the drama club's latest production - their rendition of "Romeo and Juliet", which they’d filmed entirely on iPhones with varying degrees of success. 


## Setting

* **Location:** Westford High School – a sprawling public institution nestled amidst the quaint, tree-lined streets of Westford, Massachusetts. It has stood for generations, its brick facade bearing witness to countless teenage dreams and disappointments.
* **Time:**  A late Autumn afternoon, just after school has let out for the day. The air is crisp and cool, with a hint of the approaching winter.
* **Mood:** The setting is both nostalgic and melancholic. It evokes a feeling of quiet anticipation, a sense that something is about to change, but what exactly remains uncertain. 


This opening introduces the characters and the setting while hinting at a deeper story waiting to be told.  The silence, the burnt coffee aroma, and the melancholic atmosphere provide an intriguing backdrop for the narrative. The use of specific details –  the mention of sonnets, teenage rebellion, drama club's production – adds complexity and intrigue.
