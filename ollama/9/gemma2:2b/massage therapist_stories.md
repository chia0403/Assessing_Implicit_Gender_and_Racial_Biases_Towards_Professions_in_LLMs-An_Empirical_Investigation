Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa like angry fists pounding on a tin roof. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, her usually bright turquoise scrubs dampened from the downpour outside, sighed as she adjusted the diffuser in the aromatherapy room. The scent of lavender and chamomile was supposed to soothe, but tonight it seemed to amplify the tension clinging to the air - a palpable knot of unease that even the most calming oils couldn't quite unravel. 

Tonight wasn't just another Tuesday evening. Tonight, Amelia had been entrusted with the task of helping Mrs. Eleanor Beaumont prepare for her daughter's wedding. The weight felt heavier than any of her usual clientâ€™s burdens. This was more than muscle knots and headaches; this was a legacy, a chance to weave magic in the fabric of two lives about to embark on an adventure.
