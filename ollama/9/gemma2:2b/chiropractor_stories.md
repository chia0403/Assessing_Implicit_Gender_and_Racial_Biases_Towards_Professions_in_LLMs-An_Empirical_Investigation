The morning mist clung to the town of Pinewood like cobwebs, its grey tendrils creeping across the historic stone houses as if afraid of the rising sun. Inside Dr. Alexander "Alex" Finch's clinic, however, a golden ray was cutting through the gloom, illuminating a patient named Mrs. Eleanor Thorne. Her stiff shoulders and the weary creak of her joints were testament to years spent working tirelessly in her bakery,  her spirit as sweet and warm as the bread she churned out daily.

Alex, his neatly trimmed white beard contrasting with his youthful face, sat with his hands tucked in his pockets, his gaze fixed on Mrs. Thorne's hunched form. The aroma of old book leather mingled with the subtle sweetness of almond cake from Mrs. Thorne’s bakery, creating a peculiar and comforting fragrance.  He couldn't help but smile at the scene before him; it was one of Pinewood's daily rituals: a quiet morning in his clinic, a gentle crackle of bones beneath hands that were surprisingly deft despite their age. 


Alex had been practicing chiropractor in Pinewood for over thirty years, his reputation built on an uncanny ability to ease the aches and pains that burdened the lives of its people. But this morning, something felt different. The quiet hum of the clinic seemed louder than usual, vibrating with a strange tension.  He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, like an old melody starting to repeat itself, too familiar yet unsettlingly new.  


As he began adjusting Mrs. Thorne's spine, Alex felt a sudden jolt, a shiver run down his spine and a shadow flicker at the door. His eyes met Mrs. Thorne’s, then, with a flash of blue light in her eye as she whispered: "The clock is ticking."
