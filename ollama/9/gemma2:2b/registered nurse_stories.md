Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy General Hospital, each drop a tiny percussionist playing out an endless rhythm of sorrow. The air inside was thick with antiseptic smells and a kind of weary tension that clung to the staff like cobwebs in a forgotten attic.  Eleanor Vance, RN, 42 years young but bearing the weariness of decades under her tired eyes, stood at the foot of the bed. The patient, Mrs. O'Connor, lay hooked up to machines, her face drawn and pale beneath a tangle of white hair.

Mrs. O’Connor had been the embodiment of life itself for so long; vibrant, outgoing, her laugh a sound that echoed off the walls of the hospital. Now, she was merely a shell, clinging to this world with the last vestiges of her will, her voice barely more than a croak when they finally coaxed something out of her.  Eleanor ran a hand over Mrs. O’Connor's thin blanket, feeling the coldness seep through the fabric and touch something deep within herself. The woman was fading. It wasn't just her body that was failing; it was the very essence of hope Eleanor had seen in Mrs. O’Connor for years.
