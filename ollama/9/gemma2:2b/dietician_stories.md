Rain hammered against the diner windows, each drop echoing like a tiny drumbeat on the already restless asphalt outside. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Thorne, her stethoscope perpetually slung around her neck, felt the weight of another Monday morning settle over her. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an ethereal glow on the lukewarm coffee cups and greasy spoon specials. Her usual table by the window, usually a haven for escaping the chaos outside, was occupied by Mrs. Henderson, her patient's frail mother, who clutched a crumpled photo in her hand. 

"Is it...is it gone?" she whispered, her voice barely audible over the diner's din.  Amy gently touched Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s arm, offering a quiet smile. "Gone where, Ma?"

The woman pointed to the picture. It was a picture of her husband, John, beaming with pride at his daughter's graduation last spring. "Gone... gone," she repeated, tears brimming in her eyes. 

Amy knew this scene too well. She had dealt with countless grieving families, their pain as raw and familiar as the steam rising off the coffee mugs.  It wasn't just about food; it was about navigating a life that suddenly felt unmoored, about finding meaning and solace in a world where even routine meals seemed like a poignant reminder of what once was.
