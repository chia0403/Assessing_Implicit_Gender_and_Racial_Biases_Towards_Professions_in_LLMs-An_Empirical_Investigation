## The Ballad of Miss Evelyn Maple

**Setting:**  Willow Creek Elementary School, a sprawling brick building with peeling paint and faded windows, nestled on a sleepy street lined with maple trees. 

**Main Character:** Miss Evelyn Maple, a woman whose youthful energy had been worn down by years of navigating the minefield that was teaching first-graders.  Her once vibrant turquoise scarf now sat abandoned in her locker, a testament to its years of being dragged across desks and used as a makeshift bookmark for too many stories.

**Story Opening:**

The aroma of cinnamon rolls clung stubbornly to the air like a forgotten memory. It was usually Miss Maple's signal: time to head to her classroom, where the world of first-graders awaited, each one a miniature universe with its own rules and dramas. 

Today, though, something felt off. The usual cacophony of laughter, complaints, and excited chatter had been replaced by an eerie silence.  A single, crumpled letter lay on Evelyn's desk, the words "Mr. Wilson" scrawled in a frantic hand. 

Evelyn took a deep breath, her chest tightening as she unfolded the note. Her stomach churned. It was his last year at Willow Creek; Mr. Wilsonâ€™s departure had been a long-awaited event, but this... this felt different.  A shiver ran down her spine. Was there something more to it? 


Evelyn glanced around the room, trying to make sense of the sudden disquiet. The usual tableau of crayon-covered walls and mismatched alphabet blocks seemed to mock her with their normalcy. This wasn't just Mr. Wilson leaving; this felt like a warning.
