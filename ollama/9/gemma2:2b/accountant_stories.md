The humid Chicago air clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin as he shuffled through the labyrinthine office building. Rain slicked the streets outside, each drop exploding into miniature geysers on the pavement. Inside, however, the world was an unforgiving monochrome. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile sheen onto the rows of identical desks and overflowing filing cabinets. Elias felt his stomach churn as he entered his own office – 314, nestled in a corner like a forgotten memory. 

His fingers tapped on the calculator pad, each number a weight in his hand, reflecting the crushing anxiety that had settled over him. His client, Mr. Peterson, was demanding an impossible sum of money - a tax bill for the year he’d just closed. A bill that Elias knew was far from accurate. The numbers simply didn't add up – not to him, not ever since the day his father, his mentor, had died in a mysterious accident. 

His father, a man of integrity and meticulous accounting, had always taught him the true meaning of precision, the importance of every line of code. Now, Elias was grappling with an impossible choice – stay within the rigid structure of the law or fight against it.
