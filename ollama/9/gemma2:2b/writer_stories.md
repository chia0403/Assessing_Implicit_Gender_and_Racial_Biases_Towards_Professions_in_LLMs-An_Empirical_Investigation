The air hung heavy with the scent of saltwater and old dreams as Lyra Blackwood penned her latest tale in the cozy corner of her seaside cottage. Rain lashed against the windowpanes like angry cats, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.

As if summoned by her despair, the faint crackle of static filled the air. A sudden flash illuminated her room, followed by a booming voice that resonated deep in her bones, like a lost mariner's call: "Lyra. You have been chosen."  The words echoed in the small space, their meaning both alluring and terrifyingly unknown.
