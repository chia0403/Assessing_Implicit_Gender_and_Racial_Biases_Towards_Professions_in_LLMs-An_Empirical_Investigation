Rain lashed against the windows of the cramped clinic, each drop a tiny explosion that sent a shiver down Amelia's spine. It was one of those nights that even the streetlights seemed to shrink back from the relentless grey sky, creating an atmosphere thick with both melancholy and resignation.

It wasn't just the rain that made Amelia uneasy; it was something deeper, more unsettling. The feeling clung to her like the damp sheets of her worn coat, a premonition of something waiting to surface. As a single drop of water splashed against the windowpane, she glanced at her watch.
