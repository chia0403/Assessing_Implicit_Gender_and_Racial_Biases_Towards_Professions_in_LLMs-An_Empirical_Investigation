Every day, she reported on the small-town struggles: a struggling dairy farm, a sudden spike in local theft, even the annual dispute over the best way to carve pumpkins. Today was no different. The news was swirling around her like the wind outside, a tempest in the form of a missing child and a series of bizarre, unsolved crimes that seemed to be twisting their small town into something twisted and unsettling.
