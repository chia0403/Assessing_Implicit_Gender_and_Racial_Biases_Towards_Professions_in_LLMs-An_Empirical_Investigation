The air was thick with diesel fumes and the incessant drone of machinery as Marcus "Ironhand" Callahan navigated his behemoth - a yellow-and-orange Komatsu  bulldozer named Bertha. It wasn't just any bulldozer; Bertha carried an unspoken history, a legacy passed down through generations of men whose hands had known grit and grime like Marcus'. The Nevada desert stretched out before him, a tapestry of dust clouds and bleached bone cacti, the relentless sun beating down on the cracked earth. He squinted through the haze, his eyes scanning the endless stretch of land - the same sight he'd faced countless times since joining Ironhand Excavation at nineteen. 

Today was different though. A hush had fallen over the usual cacophony of Bertha's roar and the clanking of chain-links on steel as they worked the vast expanse, a silence thick with anticipation.  The foreman, Jebediah "Jeb" Walker, leaned against the cab of his old pickup truck, his weathered face set in an expression that could only be described as grim. He tapped a worn leather patch on his pocket watch, its face faded with time and wear. 

"Something's coming," Jeb muttered to himself, his voice gravelly from years spent under the Nevada sun. "Something big." His gaze locked onto Marcus, expecting an answer he might not get.
