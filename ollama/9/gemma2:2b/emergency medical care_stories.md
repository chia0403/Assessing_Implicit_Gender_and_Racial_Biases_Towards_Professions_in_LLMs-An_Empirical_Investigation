## Story Opening

**Setting:** A bustling coastal town named Oakhaven, where sun-kissed houses cling to verdant hillsides, each with their own secret whispers of forgotten stories and hidden sorrows. 

The salty air carried the scent of sea spray and fish market treats, a comforting symphony for **Dr. Evelyn Thorne**, her nickname “Eve” known amongst paramedics as she's one of the few who can navigate the town's chaos both professionally and personally. 


**Story Opening:** The siren wailed above Eve’s head like a mournful lament.  It was another late night, another call in the labyrinthine streets where emergency lights danced on the familiar faces of Oakhaven's inhabitants. A young boy, no older than five, lay sprawled beneath a tangle of street lamps, his face a mask of pain etched with terror. His mother, pale and trembling, hovered beside him.

Eve’s instincts kicked in - years spent learning how to navigate the human body’s fragile equilibrium had made her an expert at reading the unspoken language of fear, the unspoken stories behind each broken bone or gasping breath.  Even before she stepped through the threshold of the boy's home, she knew it was going to be a long night. 


**Eve stared down at the scene, her heart sinking with the weight of another life hanging in the balance.**
