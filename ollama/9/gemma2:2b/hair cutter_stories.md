Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "The Snippet," blurring the neon sign that cast an unsteady glow over 14th Street. Inside, Amelia Featherbottom, with her signature auburn curls escaping in wild tendrils from beneath her cap and apron, sighed as she glanced at the steady stream of customers through the doors. It was a Tuesday, the day she swore would be "easier." Easier for what?  Easy wasn't really a word she used to describe a hair salon, especially one run by a woman whose very name suggested delicate, almost fragile beauty – the antithesis of the bustling city life unfolding outside her shop. 

But that was Amelia Featherbottom - resilient and stubborn as the roots of the old oak tree growing across the street, refusing to be swept away. The aroma of hairspray and chamomile conditioner mingled with the smell of rain, creating a comforting but familiar scent that somehow always felt better than facing the city's endless storm.

Amelia had inherited her grandmother's salon after she passed away just three years ago.  It wasn't the opulent salon on Madison Avenue Amelia had dreamed of as a girl reading Vogue magazines; this was a space filled with chipped enamel and old, worn chairs that creaked like tired bones. Yet, within its dusty walls lived stories – tales of love lost and found, of first haircuts for children who would grow up to be adults, of the quiet comfort of familiar strokes on hair. And Amelia, though she might not admit it often, was holding onto those very stories with every strand of hair she cut.
