The neon "Open" sign hummed on like a trapped bird in its cage, flickering out occasionally before returning to life with an irritatingly cheerful buzz.  Inside "The Last Call", the air hung thick and heavy as a fog bank, smelling of stale beer and regret. The last few customers had gone down to the usual suspects - weary travelers seeking temporary solace, or those who'd lost their own battles in this city and were hoping to find some kind of peace. 

At the bar,  Elias Thorne sat behind the counter, his back a familiar ache against the worn mahogany. He wiped his forehead with the sleeve of his stained apron, sighing as he saw his usual evening crowd shuffling in. His name wasn't exactly common, let alone a draw for these sorts, but Elias was known by some, and feared by many: for years, he'd been The Last Call's resident barkeep, his skills with potions and concoctions legendary. 

His eyes fell on the latest patron - a young woman with haunted eyes and a dress that seemed to shift colors depending on the angle of light.  She sat alone in a corner booth, her presence echoing the unsettling silence of the room. Elias knew he should leave her be, but there was something about her, like she might disappear into this very bar if she didn't find someone to listen. He picked up his dusty notebook, the worn cover whispering tales of forgotten recipes and whispered secrets. Tonight, he wouldn't just serve drinks.  Tonight, Elias Thorne would try to understand a story he had never heard before.
