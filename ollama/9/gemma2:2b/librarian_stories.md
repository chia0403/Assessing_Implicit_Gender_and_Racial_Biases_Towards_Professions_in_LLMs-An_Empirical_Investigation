## The Whispering Stacks

The air in the library was thick with the scent of aged paper and forgotten stories, a comforting aroma Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne had always adored. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting intricate patterns on the dusty shelves that stretched into the far corner of the Grandview Public Library. Rows upon rows of books, their spines worn smooth from countless hands, lined the towering walls.  

Amy was perched on a ladder at the very top shelf, her small frame dwarfed by the sprawling collection. She held aloft a particularly fragile volume, its leather cover cracked and faded with time. “Just a little more,” she murmured to herself, her voice echoing in the cavernous space. For months now, this book had been taunting Amy with its secrets. A dusty note penned in elegant script, tucked inside, seemed to invite her into its pages. 

The library felt different today. An unnerving silence hung heavy, broken only by the occasional rustle of paper. The usual symphony of whispers and hushed voices, a hallmark of reading time, was absent. Even the usually playful chatter of children had ceased. Amy felt an unsettling prickling on her skin as she began to explore the book's contents.
