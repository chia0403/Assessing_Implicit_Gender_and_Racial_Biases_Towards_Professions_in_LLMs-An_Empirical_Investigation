Rain pattered against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Mr. Alistair Worthington's office, blurring the twinkling lights of New York City beyond. The aroma of fresh lilies, courtesy of his secretary's morning ritual, fought weakly against the stale scent of yesterday's burnt coffee and the ever-present hum of ambition that permeated the air. 

Alistair Worthington was a man sculpted from spreadsheets and driven by quarterly profits. At 45, he wore the polished image of success with an unsettling ease; his sleek suit, perfectly tailored to every curve, matched the sharp angles of his face, and his eyes, the color of aged emeralds, scanned the boardroom projections on his screen like a hawk assessing its prey. Today was no different: a crucial investor call awaited. 

His company, Worthington Holdings, was a titan in the tech sector – their innovative software had revolutionized online security for businesses across the globe. But Alistair's mind wasn’t on the numbers; he couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling of being watched. Something felt different today, like an unseen hand tugging at his subconscious, urging him towards a revelation he was desperately trying to ignore.
