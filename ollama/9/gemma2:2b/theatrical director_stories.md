The air in the rehearsal room hung thick with anticipation and the scent of old sweatsocks – a peculiar combination that somehow felt strangely comforting.  Rain pattered against the dusty, Victorian windowpanes outside as **Cassian Thorne** paced back and forth before the makeshift stage, his long, charcoal-streaked hair falling into his eyes.  His brow furrowed as he peered at the scattered scripts lying on the worn wooden floor. 

A year ago, Cassian had stormed out of a prestigious theatre company in London after a particularly frustrating experience with their interpretation of a Shakespearean tragedy. He'd been convinced that audiences craved something more than just predictable formulas and dusty costumes.  His vision was to create art that felt raw, visceral, even unsettling. This small community theatre in the sleepy English village of Ashworth, while seemingly insignificant on the national stage, offered a canvas for his grand ambition. The play he was preparing to stage, "The Serpent's Whisper," was set against the backdrop of a cursed Victorian manor and its haunting legacy.  

Cassian’s eyes fell on a single sheet of paper lying crumpled under his feet, the script marked with frantic scribbles and cryptic notes – “The darkness in these walls is not just physical,” it read. "It's something they all carry."  A shiver ran down Cassian's spine as he realized that this play was more than just a theatrical endeavor. It was about confronting his own demons, about unlocking the secrets buried beneath years of meticulously crafted facade. 

He had to be careful.
