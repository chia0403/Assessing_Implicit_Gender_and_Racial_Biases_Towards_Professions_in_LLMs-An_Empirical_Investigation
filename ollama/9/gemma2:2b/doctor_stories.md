Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Croft's office, each drop echoing like tiny knives on the stained glass depicting the Virgin Mary. The storm had been raging for hours, mirroring the unease churning in Amelia’s stomach.  The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and old books, a familiar smell she normally found comforting. But tonight, it suffocated her.

Amelia clutched the worn leather-bound journal in her hands, its pages filled with intricate diagrams and handwritten notes scribbled in a hurried script. Her father had given it to her, his voice heavy as he'd explained that this was "the key," the final piece of the puzzle that would explain the mysteries of their family's long-forgotten curse. 

The journal chronicled Amelia’s lineage; a centuries-long line of doctors, each afflicted with a peculiar ailment – an unexplained condition that seemed to manifest only in generations after generation.  Now, she was staring at the final entry: "The answer lies not in the symptoms, but in the cure.” The words felt like a betrayal, as if her father’s secrets were meant to be hidden even deeper. 

Amelia's hand hovered over the call button on her bedside table, an almost automatic reaction after years of relying on his voice. But today, she had a gnawing certainty –  she would find her answer, one way or another. Tonight, she would face the storm and the curse that followed in its wake. 


**Setting:** A quaint, historic town nestled amidst rolling hills in Scotland. The old Victorian building housing Dr. Croft's practice is adorned with stone gargoyles and intricate carvings depicting biblical scenes.
