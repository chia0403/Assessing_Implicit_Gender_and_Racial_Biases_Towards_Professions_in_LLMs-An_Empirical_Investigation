Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Mrs. Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne's office, mimicking the tumultuous storm brewing inside her own mind. The flickering fluorescent light cast long, distorted shadows that danced across the worn carpet and file-filled shelves lining the walls. Outside, thunder rumbled like an angry beast, while within the confines of the small room, Ellie wrestled with a weight she couldn't quite name. It was more than just another case; it was the specter of fear, hovering over the young boy's face reflected in the worn-out yearbook photos on her desk -  Ethan Hayes, an eighth grader whose struggles seemed to echo across every class and hallway within the otherwise vibrant, suburban school. 

Ellie adjusted her spectacles perched precariously atop a crooked nose, her eyes tracing the intricate web of anxieties woven into Ethan's file folder. He hadnâ€™t spoken a word since the incident - the sudden surge of panic that had shattered the quietude of his room, leaving behind a trail of unsaid fears and broken promises. His parents stood on opposite sides of an unspoken gulf, their faces mirroring the storm raging outside. Ellie felt the familiar pressure in her temples as she started to piece together the puzzle: Ethan's recent struggles with social anxiety had escalated into something more profound, something that threatened to engulf him entirely.  She needed answers, but also a way to help him navigate through the tempest and find some semblance of calm before it swallowed him whole.
