Rain lashed against the windows of "Miller's Tax Haven," blurring the flickering neon sign outside into an abstract smear of orange and red. Inside, Evelyn Miller, her normally warm eyes clouded with fatigue, hunched over her computer. The air in the tiny office was thick with stale coffee and the scent of last week's tax forms – a smell she could barely tolerate even on the rare occasion when fresh air flowed through the vents. 

The year had been a mess, starting with Mrs. Henderson’s “unexpected” death (and the subsequent inheritance) followed by the chaotic scramble for refunds after the IRS update. Now, Evelyn faced the annual deluge of forms – another wave of tax-related misery threatening to drown her under a tidal wave of paperwork and deadlines. It was supposed to be a quiet Saturday afternoon before the storm hit. But tonight, it felt more like an impending hurricane.
