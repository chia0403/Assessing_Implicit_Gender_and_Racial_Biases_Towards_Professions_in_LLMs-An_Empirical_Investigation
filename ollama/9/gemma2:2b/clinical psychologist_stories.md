Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Thorne's office in the bustling heart of Chicago. The storm mirrored the turbulence within her, a tempest brewing in the quiet sanctuary she had cultivated for years. Outside, the world was reduced to a blur of grey and white, but inside, the air hung thick with the scent of cedarwood and old books, remnants of Eleanor's childhood spent nestled amongst stacks of volumes in her grandmother's library. Her gaze drifted towards the worn leather couch in the corner where patients were accustomed to settling down, each visit a delicate dance between empathy and professional detachment. 

This time, however, the calm was interrupted by a sharp rap on the door. The man stood in the doorway, his features as stark and unforgiving as the November sky. 
His name was Michael, she would learn, and his past held more secrets than he dared to reveal.  And just like the rain, the storm within him had begun to seep out of the confines of his closed-off shell, threatening to flood her carefully crafted world. 

Eleanor took a deep breath, ready for the fight - not against the elements outside, but against the encroaching darkness that seemed to linger in the very air inside her practice. This case was unlike any sheâ€™d encountered before; it promised an unraveling, and Eleanor, for all of her years as a clinical psychologist, felt deeply apprehensive about what the journey would bring.
