The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of old copper, clinging to Daniel "Danny" Reyes like a second skin.  His worn tool belt was a tapestry of scars and testament to years spent coaxing electricity from stubborn wires. He was perched on his battered ladder, adjusting a flickering florescent bulb in the bowels of Mrs. Peterson's Victorian home, its bones groaning under the weight of forgotten time. 

The setting sun cast long, melancholy shadows across the worn wooden floorboards as Danny surveyed his work.  He had been called in to fix the infamous "phantom breaker" that plagued this house for years. The whispers about it – a curse more than a glitch – were legendary amongst the younger electricians. Mrs. Peterson herself was convinced it was her late husband's restless spirit causing the electrical mayhem, a theory Danny found both entertaining and slightly terrifying.  

Danny had been fixing things since he could hold a screwdriver. His father had taught him to understand the language of sparks, the way they danced between metal strands and gave life to forgotten systems. Tonight, however, the lines between reality and superstition were blurring – even for someone like Danny, who knew his craft better than anyone else in town.
