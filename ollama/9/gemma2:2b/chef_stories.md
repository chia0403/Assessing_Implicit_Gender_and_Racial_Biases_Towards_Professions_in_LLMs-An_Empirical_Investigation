## Story Opening:

Rain hammered against the bakery windows like angry tin soldiers marching in formation. Inside, **Alastor "Al" Thorne** stood before his most ambitious creation yet – a towering three-tiered cake adorned with sugar flowers and spun sugar swirls that resembled snowflakes dancing on air. The aroma of vanilla and cinnamon, usually comforting, felt heavy tonight, thick as the fog creeping through the alleyway outside. Al's eyes, normally alight with the joy of creating, were dull, clouded by a worry he refused to let out into the world. 

**Setting:**  The quaint, rain-swept bakery called "Whispering Frost" was nestled in the heart of a Victorian seaside town. The shop itself was a cozy haven – warm wooden floors, pastel paint, and shelves overflowing with jars of jam and cookies. Despite its charm, the business was struggling. Al's passion for baking was a double-edged sword; his talent was unmatched, but his tendency to pour every ounce of himself into his creations had made him financially unstable. 


**Next:**  A wave of dread washed over him as he heard the familiar "beep" from his phone. It was another late delivery notice – this time for an order of delicate macarons for a prestigious family event. The irony wasn't lost on Al: it was a chance to finally make good, but also a reminder of how easily his ambition could slip away like sugar dust in the wind.
