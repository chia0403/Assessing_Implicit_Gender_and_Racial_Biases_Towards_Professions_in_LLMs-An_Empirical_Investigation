The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and blood, a symphony of sharp, metallic tangs that had been the soundtrack to Thomas Blackwood's life for as long as he could remember. The shop, Blackwood's Fine Meats, was his father's legacy; a place where weathered walls held stories of generations past, each cut and char mark whispering tales of survival, resilience, and the quiet art of butchering. 

Thomas knelt amidst the mountain of freshly-cleaned carcasses, his calloused hands tracing familiar grooves on a side of beef.  He wasn't just a butcher; he was an artist, coaxing out beauty from raw material. The rhythmic clank of cleavers against bone, the sizzle of fat melting in the pan - these were the notes to his symphony, each action a graceful dance between craft and instinct. But tonight, something felt different. Tonight, an unwelcome storm was brewing on the horizon, its whispers a stark contrast to the comforting hum of the shop. The sky outside was the colour of bruised plums; a harbinger of what was about to unfold.
