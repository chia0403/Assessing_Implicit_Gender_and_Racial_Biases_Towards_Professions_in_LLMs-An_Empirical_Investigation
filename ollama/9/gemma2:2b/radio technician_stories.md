The hiss of static filled the airwaves as young Jasper "Jazz" Wright, his forehead creased with concentration, fiddled with the tuning dial on his radio. The sun beat down relentlessly on the back porch of his ramshackle shack nestled in the middle of nowhere, Arizona. The only sound louder than the insistent whine of the receiver was the low rumble from the nearby quarry – a constant reminder that beneath the dusty plains lay something vast and unknown. 

Jazz had spent years honing his skills as a radio technician, painstakingly rebuilding vintage equipment in the hope of picking up signals beyond the normal broadcast range. His obsession wasn't just about tinkering; it was about deciphering the whispers of the universe itself, searching for hidden stories and forgotten voices across the vast expanse of radio waves.  He dreamed of a day when his receiver would crackle to life with something other than static – an anomaly that would break the mundane and expose the secrets buried in plain sight. The kind of signal that could change everything.
