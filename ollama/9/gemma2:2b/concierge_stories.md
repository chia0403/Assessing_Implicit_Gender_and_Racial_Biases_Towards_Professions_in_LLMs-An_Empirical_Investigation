The worn leather of his briefcase felt stiff in Arthur's calloused hands. He pushed open the ornate double doors of the Grand Astoria Hotel, allowing the humid Parisian air to billow around him like a sea breeze, smelling faintly of lavender and freshly baked bread. The lobby was always buzzing at this hour – just after five pm, when the rush of day travelers began their descent from the airport and the city's upper crust started making their evening rounds. Arthur was used to it, but tonight felt different. There was a hum of anticipation in the air, a subtle nervousness that seemed to emanate from the hushed whispers and lingering glances exchanged between the guests and staff alike.

Arthur’s full name was Arthur DeVille. It was not a name one chose lightly, especially in the bustling metropolis of Paris, where even the most ordinary Parisian names were imbued with a certain weight and significance. A concierge at the Grand Astoria had to be more than just a bearer of keys and a keeper of schedules; they were a guardian of a life built on tradition, and perhaps something more. Tonight, Arthur could feel that he was standing on the precipice of something significant, an unspoken event swirling in the hushed corners of his mind.
