Rain lashed against the grimy window of Amelia "Mac" Mallory's office, the sound barely registering as she flipped through a worn file. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of stale coffee and despair. It was late, past midnight, but Mac had a job to do. 

The case was simple enough â€“ missing person, local barman named David "Digger" Miller vanished without a trace after one too many drinks on Tuesday night.  But Digger was the kind of guy who went up to every stranger in the alley and started talking about his life story - a man with an aura like a weathered old sailor with stories for days. Mac, known in her circles for finding answers where others saw only silence, took it upon herself to unravel the mystery. 

**Setting:**  A dingy but bustling office on Elm Street in New Orleans. Mac's office was crammed with vintage books, faded photographs, and a tangle of old blueprints that suggested more than just private investigation - she was hunting for forgotten lore. Outside, the city pulsed with life, a symphony of honking cars, jazz bars, and alley cats chasing stray pigeons. 


**Main Character:** Amelia "Mac" Mallory, a tough-as-nails private detective whose intuition was as sharp as her wit.  She had eyes that saw beneath the grime and hidden agendas, and ears that heard the secrets whispered on smoky backstreet corners.
