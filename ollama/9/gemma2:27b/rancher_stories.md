The wind whipped across the plains, biting at Elias Blackwood's weathered face as he surveyed his herd. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling like miniature tornadoes against the backdrop of a cloudless, cerulean sky. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the world into a shimmering mirage.  Elias squinted, his calloused hand shading his eyes. His gaze swept across the undulating sea of brown and white hides, searching for any signs of distress. 

He'd been a rancher all his life, inheriting this land from his grandfather who had, in turn, inherited it from his father before him. The Blackwood Ranch was more than just property; it was woven into the fabric of Eliasâ€™s being, its rhythm and routines as familiar as his own heartbeat.  But lately, a sense of unease had settled over him, like a storm brewing on the horizon.
