The humid Miami air hung heavy, even at 6:00 am. Palm trees swayed languidly in the breeze, their fronds casting dancing shadows across the glistening sand. The rhythmic crash of waves against the shore blended with the distant pulsing beat emanating from Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez's beachfront bootcamp.

Amy, a whirlwind of energy despite the early hour, bounced on her toes, her neon pink tank top and black leggings already slick with sweat. Her dark curls were pulled back in a tight ponytail, escaping strands framing a face radiating infectious enthusiasm.  

Today's class was special. A local news crew was filming a segment about Miami's burgeoning fitness scene, and Amy was their star attraction. She took a deep breath, channeling her pre-workout jitters into excitement. This could be her big break â€“ a chance to share her passion for fitness with the entire city.
