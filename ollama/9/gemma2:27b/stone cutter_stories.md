The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's weathered shoulders as he chipped away at the granite block. Dust swirled around him, catching in his thick beard and turning it grey. He squinted, focusing on the delicate line he was carving into the stone – the curve of a swan’s neck for a fountain planned for the Duke's new garden.

Elias lived in Stonemont, a town nestled amongst rolling hills and carved from the very granite he worked with. Generations before him had mined the stone, shaping it into everything from humble tombstones to grand cathedral arches. The air itself hummed with the legacy of his craft. But Elias wasn't like his ancestors. He dreamt not of grand monuments, but of smaller, more intimate pieces - sculptures that whispered stories instead of shouting them.

Today, however, the Duke demanded a swan. A symbol of grace and purity, he said, for his pristine garden. Elias sighed. Grace and purity were fine, but they didn't fill him with inspiration. He longed to carve something wild, something untamed – perhaps a snarling wolf or a soaring hawk.

A sudden clatter from the back of his workshop snapped him out of his reverie. His apprentice, young Toby, stood amidst scattered chisels and a broken hammer head, face pale with alarm.

"Master Thorne," Toby stammered, "there's a stranger at the door. He says… he says he needs your help urgently."
