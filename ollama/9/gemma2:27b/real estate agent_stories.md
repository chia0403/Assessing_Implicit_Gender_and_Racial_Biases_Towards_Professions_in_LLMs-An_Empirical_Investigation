The humid Charleston air clung to Eliza Jane Beaufort like a second skin as she navigated her vintage cherry-red Mustang down Meeting Street. Cobblestones, slick with recent rain, glistened beneath the gas lamps that cast an orange glow over the historic district. Eliza, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a loose braid and emerald eyes sparkling with determination, was on her way to show a grand Victorian townhouse nestled just off Rainbow Row.

She'd been itching for this listing â€“ it had all the charm and intrigue she loved about Charleston real estate: ornate balconies dripping with jasmine, a wrought iron gate adorned with faded gold fleurs-de-lis, and whispers of hidden stories within its aged brick walls. 


Eliza Jane knew this town like the back of her hand. She could point out the exact window where Edgar Allan Poe penned "The Raven" or recount tales of Revolutionary War skirmishes in whispered tones. But today, she was focused on something else: selling this magnificent house to a family who would appreciate its history and beauty as much as she did.
