Rain lashed against the windows of "Critter Care," blurring the neon sign into an abstract smear of pink and green. Inside, Dr. Eleanor Vance sighed, pushing away a wet curl that had escaped her braid. The storm had kept most people home, but not all creatures were so easily deterred. 

Eleanor glanced at the lone occupant of the waiting room: a shivering chihuahua huddled in a towel burrito, its large brown eyes fixed on her with anxious whimpers. She knew this little guy – Pipsqueak was his name – and she knew his owner, Mrs. Henderson, wouldn't be far behind. 

The clinic, nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of Willow Creek, had seen its fair share of emergencies over Eleanor’s ten years there. From orphaned kittens to injured hawks, each creature that crossed her threshold carried a story, and Eleanor felt a deep responsibility for their wellbeing. But tonight, with the wind howling like a banshee outside and Pipsqueak trembling on the floor, a sense of unease crept into Eleanor's heart. It wasn't just the storm – there was something else in the air, something that made her shiver despite the warmth radiating from the old cast-iron stove.
