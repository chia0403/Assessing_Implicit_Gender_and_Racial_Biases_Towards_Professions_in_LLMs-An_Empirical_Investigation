Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Amelia "Amy" Lawson's tiny Brooklyn apartment. The neon glow of a bodega sign across the street flickered erratically, painting stripes of lurid green onto her cluttered work desk. Amy chewed on the end of her paintbrush, frustration knotting in her stomach. The deadline for the new restaurant logo was looming, and all she had was a half-hearted sketch of a fork and spoon intertwined in a vaguely heart shape.

"Ugh," she groaned, tossing the brush onto the overflowing palette. "This is hopeless." Her eyes darted around the cramped space â€“ mountains of design books threatening to topple over, crumpled sketches littering every surface, her trusty Mac laptop humming patiently in the corner.

Inspiration seemed as elusive as a unicorn riding a bicycle. Maybe she needed a change of scenery? A walk through Prospect Park in this downpour didn't seem appealing, but something had to jolt her out of this creative rut.
