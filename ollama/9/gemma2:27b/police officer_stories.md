Rain lashed against the cracked windshield of Detective Elias "Eli" Blackwood's cruiser, blurring the neon glow of the Lucky Dragon Casino sign ahead. The air hung heavy with humidity and the metallic scent of blood. Eli gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the worn leather. He hated these late-night calls, especially when they involved something as messy as this. 

The scene was a back alley behind the casino, cordoned off by yellow tape flapping like distressed flags in the wind. A lone streetlamp cast an anemic pool of light on the slick asphalt where the body lay - a man, his face contorted in a silent scream, a crimson stain blooming across his chest. 

Eli sighed, the weight of another life lost settling heavily in his gut. He was tired, bone-tired, but this was his job, his city. He wouldn't let them down. Not tonight. Not ever. Pulling on his rain slicker, he stepped out into the storm, the harsh yellow light illuminating the grim tableau before him.
