Rain lashed against the windows of "The Knotty Pine", Amelia Cartwright's cozy massage studio nestled on a quiet side street in Portland, Oregon. The aroma of lavender and sandalwood incense battled valiantly against the damp chill seeping in from the alleyway behind. Amelia, her auburn braids escaping their usual bun, sighed as she surveyed the deserted waiting area. A Tuesday afternoon storm wasn't exactly prime time for relaxing massages. She glanced at her phone â€“ no new appointments.

The silence was broken by a sharp rapping on the front door. Amelia startled, her hand instinctively reaching for the smooth, heated stones she kept nearby for soothing sore muscles.  Who would be brave enough to venture out in this downpour?
