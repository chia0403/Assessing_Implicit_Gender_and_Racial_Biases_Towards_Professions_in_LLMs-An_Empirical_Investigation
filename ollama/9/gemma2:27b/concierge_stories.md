The plush crimson carpet muffled Eloise Beaumont's footsteps as she glided through the opulent lobby of The Grand Blackwood Hotel.  Sunlight streamed through the stained glass dome overhead, painting intricate rainbows across the polished marble floor. The air hummed with hushed conversations and the gentle tinkling of a distant grand piano. Eloise, impeccably dressed in her midnight blue uniform with gold braid detailing, adjusted the pearl necklace framing her collarbone – a subtle reminder of her family's past connection to this very establishment. For generations, Beaumonts had served as The Grand Blackwood’s esteemed concierges, entrusted with upholding its legacy of unparalleled service and discretion. Today, the mantle fell on Eloise's shoulders, and she wore it with quiet pride.

But today was different. A palpable tension crackled beneath the surface of The Grand Blackwood's usual tranquility. A string of peculiar requests had arrived at her desk – a private séance in the ballroom, an order for twelve black ravens delivered to suite 407, and a cryptic message requesting "the key to unlocking shadows." Eloise, accustomed to catering to the whims of the wealthy and eccentric, felt a prickle of unease. Something was amiss in this gilded cage.
