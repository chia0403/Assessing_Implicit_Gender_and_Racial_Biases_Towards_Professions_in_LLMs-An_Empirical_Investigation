The air hung thick with the scent of beeswax and lavender in Thaddeus Bartholomew's workshop. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windowpane above his workbench, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its rays. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oldhaven echoed with the clatter of hawkers and the cries of gulls circling overhead. But within these four walls, time seemed to slow, measured only by the rhythmic snip-snip of Thaddeus' shears against fabric.

He was hunched over a bolt of deep crimson velvet, his nimble fingers coaxing it into the shape of a doublet for Lord Everly. The silk lining gleamed like moonlight beneath the plush velvet, and Thaddeus couldn't help but feel a pang of pride at the artistry unfolding before him. For Thaddeus Bartholomew wasn't just any tailor; he was the finest in all of Oldhaven, his creations whispered about in hushed tones amongst the city's elite.

But today, a familiar unease tugged at the edges of his concentration. A shadow lingered over his workshop, a sense of impending change that felt as palpable as the wool beneath his calloused fingertips. He glanced towards the door, half expecting someone to burst through it â€“ a desperate duchess needing a last-minute alteration, perhaps, or a messenger with news from beyond Oldhaven's walls.
