The morning mist clung to Butcher's Row like cobwebs, obscuring the vibrant crimson awnings and the cheerful painted signs advertising "Finest Cuts in the Five Boroughs!" Bartholomew 'Bart' Grimshaw, proprietor of Grimshaw's Meats, sighed as he wrestled open the heavy oak door. The smell of yesterday's rosemary-infused sausages still lingered, a comforting aroma amidst the damp chill. Bart ran a hand through his greying beard, the faint tremor in his fingers betraying his sixty-odd years. He wasn't just battling the morning mist today; a darker cloud had settled over Butcher's Row. A cloud named Silas Blackwood. 


Blackwood, a newcomer with a butcher shop across the street, was known for two things: his unsettlingly pale complexion and his suspiciously low prices. Bart suspected something foul - maybe even literally foul - was going on, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. Today, as Bart surveyed his meticulously arranged cuts of beef, pork, and lamb, a decision hardened in his gut. He wouldn't let Blackwood undercut him, not without a fight. It was time to remind Butcher's Row why Grimshaw's Meats was the undisputed king of the street.
