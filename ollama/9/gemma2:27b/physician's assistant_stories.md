Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the makeshift clinic, each drop echoing like a hammer blow in the stifling heat. Emilia Reyes, her brow slick with sweat despite the damp chill in the air, adjusted the lamp casting a harsh yellow glow over the rickety examination table. The smell of antiseptic battled with the earthy scent of damp wood and woodsmoke drifting from a nearby fire. Outside, the relentless downpour blurred the already indistinct silhouettes of the ramshackle huts that made up Esperanza, a village nestled deep in the Honduran rainforest. Emilia sighed, her gaze drawn to the worried face peering at her through the doorway.

She knew this look well. It was the look of someone who had walked for hours, maybe days, through mud and treacherous terrain, carrying their sick loved one on their back.  Emilia took a deep breath, steeling herself for another long night, knowing that for many in Esperanza, she was their only hope.
