The flickering fluorescent lights of Northwood High's library cast long, skeletal shadows across the rows of dusty tomes. Beatrice "Bea" Augustine, her sensible cardigan perpetually askew, adjusted her spectacles and sighed.  It was 3:45 pm on a Friday, the air thick with anticipation for the weekend, but Bea remained resolutely chained to her desk, grading stacks of essays on Shakespeare's *Macbeth*.

The musty scent of aging paper mingled with the faint aroma of stale coffee wafting from Bea's travel mug. Outside, the autumn wind rattled the library windows, a mournful symphony echoing the weariness settling in her bones. She glanced at the overflowing inbox on her desk, a testament to the never-ending tide of emails, parent requests, and committee meetings that punctuated her days.

Tonight, however, promised something different. Tonight, Bea wasn't just Mrs. Augustine, the stoic English teacher. Tonight, she was Beatrice, adventurer, seeker of forgotten lore.  Tonight, she would finally delve into the mystery hidden within the dusty grimoires she had inherited from her eccentric grandmother - a legacy that whispered promises of ancient magic and untold secrets.
