The rusted squeak of the gate echoed through the deserted rose garden, a mournful counterpoint to the cheerful chirping of sparrows flitting amongst the thorny canes. Silas Beaumont, his calloused hands gripping a dented watering can, surveyed the scene with a sigh. Dawn had barely cracked the horizon, casting long shadows across the overgrown beds and crumbling fountain that were once the pride of this grand estate.

Now, the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor lay dormant, swallowed by a creeping tide of weeds and neglect. Silas, the only remaining fixture of a bygone era, diligently tended to what he could. It was his solitary sanctuary, a place where memories lingered in the scent of damp earth and decaying roses, whispering tales of elegant balls, laughter echoing through sun-drenched courtyards, and a love story as bittersweet as the fading beauty around him.
