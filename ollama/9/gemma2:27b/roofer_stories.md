The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck as he wrestled a stubborn bundle of shingles into place.  He squinted against the glare reflecting off the zinc flashing, sweat stinging his eyes. Beneath him, Chicago sprawled like a concrete and glass jungle, its rhythm a constant hum punctuated by sirens and distant car horns. The roof Elias was working on, atop an aging brick apartment building in Lincoln Park, offered a panoramic view of the city's skyline â€“ a jagged line of steel and glass piercing the haze.

Elias adjusted his worn baseball cap, grateful for the meager shade it offered. He loved the work, the physicality of it, the sense of accomplishment that came with transforming a dilapidated roof into something solid and secure. But today, even the satisfaction wasn't enough to quell the gnawing anxiety in his gut. Something was wrong. He just couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.
