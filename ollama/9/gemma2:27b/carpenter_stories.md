The scent of cedar and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma Elias Hawthorne knew better than his own reflection. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windowpanes of his workshop, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stillness. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Port Haven bustled with life – fishermen hawking their catch, children chasing stray dogs, and the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith's hammer echoing from down the lane. 

But Elias barely registered the sounds. His gaze was fixed on the intricate curves he was carving into a mahogany chest, his weathered hands moving with practiced precision. Each stroke of the chisel chipped away not just wood, but years of loneliness and longing. He dreamt of building something grander than chests and tables – something that would leave a lasting mark on Port Haven, something that would make him feel truly connected to this place he'd called home for twenty years.

Today, however, Elias was simply trying to finish the chest before sundown.  A commission from the town's wealthiest merchant promised a hefty sum, enough to buy new tools and perhaps even… a ticket aboard one of the ships sailing south towards warmer climes.  Elias had always yearned to see more of the world, but fear and the weight of familiarity kept him tethered to Port Haven.
