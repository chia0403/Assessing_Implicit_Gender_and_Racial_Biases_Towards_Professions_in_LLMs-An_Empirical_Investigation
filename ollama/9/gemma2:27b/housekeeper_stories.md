Rain lashed against the arched windows of Blackwood Manor, mimicking the relentless drumbeat in Amelia Hawthorne's chest. The ancient house groaned under the assault, its timbers protesting centuries of weathering wind and storm. Shadows danced in the flickering gaslight, making the ornate furniture seem monstrous and menacing.

Amelia, with her sensible grey bun and perpetually damp apron, stood frozen at the foot of the grand staircase. Dust motes swirled in the air disturbed by a gust that rattled the panes. This wasn't just any storm; it felt ominous, pregnant with an unspoken threat. It mirrored the unease twisting in Amelia's gut.

She was used to Blackwood Manor’s quirks – the creaking floorboards, the phantom drafts, the unsettling chill that seemed to seep from its very stones. But tonight, everything felt different, charged with a strange energy that pricked at her senses like static electricity.  

A sudden crash from upstairs shattered the silence, sending a shiver down Amelia's spine. It was time to face whatever lurked in the shadowed recesses of Blackwood Manor.
