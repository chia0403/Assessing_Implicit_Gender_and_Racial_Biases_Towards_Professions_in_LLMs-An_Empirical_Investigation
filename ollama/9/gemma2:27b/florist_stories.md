Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the vibrant colours of Amelia Hawthorne's flower displays into watercolour washes. The scent of lilies and freesia mingled with the damp earthiness of the pavement outside, creating an oddly comforting aroma in the small, cluttered space. Amelia, her auburn hair escaping its braid and clinging to her forehead, sighed as she surveyed the day's meagre sales: a single bouquet of roses for a funeral, and a wilted bunch of carnations destined for someone's neglected windowsill. 

"Business is blooming," she muttered sarcastically, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. The irony wasn't lost on her â€“ a florist withering away in the heart of bustling London. Perhaps it was time to consider a career change, one that didn't involve whispering sweet nothings to tulips and coaxing orchids into bloom.

But then, a bell chimed above the door, announcing a customer. Amelia straightened, a flicker of hope igniting in her chest. Maybe this wasn't the end after all.  Perhaps today was the day the shop would finally come alive with colour, laughter, and the intoxicating scent of possibilities.
