The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and desperation. Neon signs flickered outside the grimy windows of The Last Call, casting grotesque shadows on the cracked leather booths and sticky bartop. Silas Blackwood, his name as weathered and worn as the establishment he tended, sighed as he polished a glass for the tenth time, the rhythmic motion doing little to soothe the gnawing emptiness in his gut. 

It was past midnight, the usual crowd thinned out, leaving behind only a few lonely souls nursing their sorrows. Silas knew their stories by heart – the heartbroken waitress drowning her tears in cheap tequila, the gambler chasing his last dollar, the old man haunted by ghosts of a past he couldn't outrun.


Silas wasn't one to judge. He had his own demons to wrestle with, secrets swirling beneath the surface like the sediment at the bottom of an untouched beer. 

The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Silas glanced up, his heart thudding with a strange anticipation. The newcomer was unlike anyone he'd seen before – tall and slender, draped in a long coat that concealed their features in shadow.  They walked with a quiet confidence, their boots barely making a sound on the worn wooden floor.

"What can I get you?" Silas asked, his voice rough from disuse. 

The figure paused, seemingly considering him for a moment before speaking in a low, husky voice.

"Something strong," they said, "and something with a story."
