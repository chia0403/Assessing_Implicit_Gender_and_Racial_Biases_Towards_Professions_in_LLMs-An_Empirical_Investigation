Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Theodore "Teddy" Beaumont's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the already fractured pane. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Teddy stared out at the dreary cityscape, the neon glow of a distant liquor store reflecting in his tired eyes.

He was drowning in paperwork – claims for leaky roofs, fender benders, and even an absurd claim for "emotional distress" caused by a malfunctioning ice cream machine.  His phone buzzed incessantly with new calls, each one another plea for help that he felt powerless to answer. 

Teddy wasn't cut out for this life. He dreamed of open spaces, fresh air, maybe writing poetry in a cabin by a lake. But life, like a rogue hailstorm, had other plans. Now, stuck in his cramped office, Teddy was just another cog in the machine, grinding away at the mundane realities of insurance claims.

But today was different. Today, a mysterious letter arrived, its contents promising something far beyond leaky roofs and broken ice cream machines – something that could change Teddy's life forever.
