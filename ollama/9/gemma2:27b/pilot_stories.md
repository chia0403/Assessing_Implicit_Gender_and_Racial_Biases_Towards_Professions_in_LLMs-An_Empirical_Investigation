The pre-dawn air hung heavy with moisture, clinging to Eleanor Vance's skin like a second shirt as she climbed into the cockpit. The hangar lights cast long, distorted shadows across the scratched metal fuselage of her Cessna 172, making it look more like a slumbering beast than a trusty steed.  Beyond the corrugated iron walls, the sky was just beginning to blush with the promise of sunrise over the rolling hills of the Shenandoah Valley. Eleanor inhaled deeply, the scent of aviation fuel mingling with damp earth and dew-kissed grass – a familiar aroma that always calmed her nerves.

Today’s flight wasn't for pleasure.  It was a delivery, a vital one. Tucked away in the cargo hold were vials containing precious samples for a research lab on the other side of the Appalachian Mountains. The clock was ticking, and Eleanor knew she had to get airborne before the mountain thermals started rising, making her flight unpredictable and potentially dangerous.

But something wasn't right. A faint buzzing sound emanated from behind the instrument panel, followed by a flicker in the engine gauges. Eleanor frowned. This wasn't part of the usual pre-flight symphony.  

Was it just a glitch? Or was this the start of something more serious?
