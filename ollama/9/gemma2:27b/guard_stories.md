The air hung thick with the smell of brine and woodsmoke as Elias Blackwood adjusted his helm, the cold iron biting into his forehead. He squinted through the narrow slits at the churning grey sea beyond the obsidian ramparts of Blackrock Keep. A storm was brewing â€“ he could taste it on his tongue, feel it in the tremor running through the ancient stone beneath his boots.

Elias wasn't afraid of storms. He was a Blackwood, after all, forged from the same unforgiving rock that guarded their ancestral home. For generations, his family had stood sentinel against the treacherous tides and the whispers of ancient magic that clung to these shores. But tonight, something felt different. The wind carried a mournful howl, laced with an unnatural chill that seeped into his bones. Even the gargoyles perched atop the ramparts seemed to watch him with unsettling awareness, their stone eyes glinting like malevolent stars.

As Elias gripped his spear tighter, a shiver ran down his spine. He knew, deep in his gut, that tonight wouldn't be like any other night. Tonight, something was stirring in the depths.
