Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Finchâ€™s cramped office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside him. Papers lay scattered across his desk like fallen leaves, each one a reminder of the uphill battle he faced. The flickering fluorescent light cast long, distorted shadows on the worn furniture and faded legal posters on the walls. A faint smell of stale coffee hung in the air, mingling with the scent of damp wool from Elias's threadbare coat. He was weary, his face etched with lines that spoke of countless sleepless nights spent poring over case files. Yet, a spark of defiance still flickered in his deep-set blue eyes.

Elias Finch, a man who believed justice could be found even in the darkest corners, stared at the photograph on his desk - a faded image of a young girl with a gap-toothed grin. Her name was Lily, and she was the reason Elias wouldn't give up.
