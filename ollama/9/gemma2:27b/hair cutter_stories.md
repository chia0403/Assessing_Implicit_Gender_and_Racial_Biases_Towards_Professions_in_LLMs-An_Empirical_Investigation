The scent of lavender and clove hung heavy in the air, battling with the sharp, metallic tang of disinfectant. A symphony of snips and buzzes punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter filled Salon Aurelia, a small but charming haven tucked away on a cobbled street in Montmartre. Elodie Moreau, her auburn braids piled atop her head like a crown, meticulously swept stray hairs from the plush velvet chair, her gaze reflecting the warm glow of the pendant lights. Today was shaping up to be another busy day in her little corner of Paris. Tourists were trickling in, drawn by the promise of a "French makeover," and Elodie's regulars were already filling their usual slots, eager for their dose of Elodie's magic touch and her signature lavender tea. 

But today was different. Today, Elodie felt a prickle of unease, a subtle shift in the salon's usual rhythm. A shadow seemed to linger at the edges of her vision, an inexplicable chill in the air despite the summer sun blazing outside.  As she prepared for her next client, a woman with a face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and eyes that glittered like emeralds, Elodie couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to unfold.
