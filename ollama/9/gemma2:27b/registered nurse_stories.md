Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Hospital, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Amelia Rose Callahan's already fraying nerves. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and something else - fear, she realized, her own mingling with that of the patients around her. It was a Wednesday, but felt like a Friday the thirteenthth.

The emergency room buzzed with controlled chaos, a symphony of beeping monitors, hurried footsteps, and panicked cries. Amelia, a seasoned RN with five years under her belt at St. Jude's, navigated the maelstrom with practiced ease.  She checked vitals, administered medications, reassured anxious family members – all while fighting the gnawing feeling that something wasn’t right. 

Tonight felt different. The cases were more severe, the injuries stranger, and a palpable tension hung in the air. Amelia chalked it up to her exhaustion. She hadn't had a proper night's sleep in weeks, juggling double shifts with caring for her ailing grandmother.  But deep down, a seed of unease had been planted.

Then came the ambulance siren, piercing through the storm’s roar. It heralded the arrival of a patient unlike any Amelia had ever seen.
