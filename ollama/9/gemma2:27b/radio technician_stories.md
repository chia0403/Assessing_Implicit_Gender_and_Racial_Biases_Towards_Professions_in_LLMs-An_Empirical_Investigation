Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound. The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to chew on. Inside the cramped workshop, fluorescent lights flickered, casting long shadows that danced with the rhythm of the downpour.  Aromas of burnt solder and ozone mingled with the earthy scent of the storm.

Elias Finchley, his brow furrowed in concentration, adjusted a tiny capacitor on the radio receiver he was repairing. His calloused fingers, stained with grease and flux, moved with practiced precision. He could practically hear the faint whine of the vacuum tubes, even before he flipped the power switch. Elias was a man who lived for the symphony of static, the crackle of incoming signals, and the thrill of bringing voices from distant lands back to life. 

But tonight, something felt different. A restlessness pulsed beneath his skin, a sense of anticipation tinged with unease. The storm wasn't just an atmospheric disturbance; it felt like something was brewing in the ether itself. As Elias reached for his soldering iron, a burst of static erupted from the receiver, followed by a voice, faint and distorted, speaking a language he didn't recognize.
