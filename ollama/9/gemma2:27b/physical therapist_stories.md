The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Ramirez's auburn braid across her face as she stood on the edge of the weathered boardwalk. Below, the turquoise waters of the Caribbean Sea churned restlessly, mirroring the turmoil in her own chest. Leaving Chicago for this remote island off the coast of Belize hadn't been easy. Trading the sterile predictability of Northwestern Memorial Hospital for a dilapidated clinic with sand floors and rusted equipment felt like stepping back a century, but Amy needed this. Needed the sun on her face, the rhythm of the waves, and the chance to rebuild her shattered life after the accident that had stolen her fianc√©.

This island, Isla Esmeralda, was supposed to be a fresh start. A place to heal, not just physically, but emotionally. She'd signed a contract with the only clinic on the island, determined to use her skills as a physical therapist to help the locals who had limited access to healthcare. But as she stared out at the vast expanse of ocean, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that maybe this wasn't enough. Maybe healing herself would take more than just sunshine and salt air.  Maybe it would take facing the ghosts she'd been running from all along.
