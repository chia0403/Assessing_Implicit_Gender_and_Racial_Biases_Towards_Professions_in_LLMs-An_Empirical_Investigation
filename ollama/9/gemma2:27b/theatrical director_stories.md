The air in the Grand Majestic Theatre hummed with anticipation, a discordant symphony of hammering, sawing, and muffled curses rising from the stage below.  Evelyn Beatrice Hawthorne, her silver hair escaping its usual impeccable bun, surveyed the chaos with an unwavering gaze. Fifty years in theatre had taught her that controlled pandemonium was often the prelude to a masterpiece.

The Grand Majestic, once a jewel box of gilded balconies and plush velvet seats, was now shrouded in dust sheets and scaffolding, undergoing a desperately needed renovation. Evelyn had poured her savings into this project, betting on the revival of a faded star. Tonight, she would unveil her latest production â€“ a daring adaptation of Shakespeare's "Macbeth" set in a dystopian future. The stage manager, young Theo, his face pale with stress, scurried towards her, clipboard clutched tightly.

"Evelyn," he rasped, "the holographic projectors are malfunctioning."
