The sun beat down on Elias Blackwood's back, turning his work shirt damp with sweat even before he reached the first cone. He grimaced, tugging the brim of his battered Stetson lower to shield his eyes. The asphalt shimmered in the heat, radiating waves of invisible fire that made it feel like he was walking through a furnace.

Elias surveyed the stretch of highway ahead: mile after mile of cracked and potholed blacktop baking under the relentless Nevada sun. Today's task - filling the yawning chasms in lane three with hot asphalt â€“ promised to be long and grueling. He sighed, hefting his shovel onto his shoulder and trudging towards the rumbling behemoth that was the asphalt truck. 

The distant whine of a semi-truck engine broke the silence, a familiar soundtrack to Elias' days spent mending the arteries of this vast desert state. As the truck thundered past, kicking up a plume of dust in its wake, he couldn't help but feel a pang of longing for something beyond the endless horizon and the monotonous rhythm of road repair.
