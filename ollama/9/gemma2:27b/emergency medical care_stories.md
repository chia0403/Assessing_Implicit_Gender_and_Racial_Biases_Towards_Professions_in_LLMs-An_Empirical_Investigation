Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city into an impressionistic smear.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Ramirez, her dark ponytail plastered to her forehead with sweat, wrestled with a gurney, maneuvering it through the cramped space and towards the back doors. The siren wailed, its mournful cry echoing her own anxiety.

They were responding to a multi-car pileup on the freeway â€“ a call that always sent a shiver down Amy's spine. In five years as an EMT with the Chicago Fire Department, she'd seen enough trauma to last a lifetime, yet each call was a fresh wave of adrenaline and uncertainty.

Tonight, though, felt different.  The storm, a raging beast unleashed on the city, seemed to mirror the turmoil brewing inside her. Amy hadn't slept properly in weeks, haunted by nightmares of past calls, of faces she couldn't save. She longed for a moment of calm, a chance to catch her breath and remember why she chose this chaotic path. But tonight, there was no time for introspection. The lives hanging in the balance demanded her full attention.
