The flickering fluorescent lights hummed an off-key symphony as Theodore "Teddy" Beaumont mopped the linoleum floor of the Grand Blackwood Auditorium. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale popcorn, dust motes dancing in the pale beams that sliced through the cavernous space.  It was past midnight, and Teddy was alone, the echoes of yesterday's concert fading into the silence. He paused his work, leaning on the mop handle and letting out a sigh that mingled with the faint hiss of the steam cleaner. Above him, the ornate gilded balconies seemed to loom like watchful ghosts, their velvet seats empty and waiting for the next performance.

Teddy knew this place better than anyone. He'd walked its every aisle, polished its brass railings until they shone, emptied overflowing bins of discarded programs, and scrubbed away spilled champagne with a resigned sigh. Yet tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he glanced at the shadowy stage. The silence seemed heavier than usual, pregnant with an unseen energy that sent shivers down his arms.  He chalked it up to fatigue, but the feeling lingered, a discordant note in the symphony of the night.
