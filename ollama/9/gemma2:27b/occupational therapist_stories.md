Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunnyside Rehabilitation Center, blurring the view of the manicured gardens into an impressionistic watercolour. Inside, the air hummed with the quiet industriousness that only a place dedicated to healing could possess. 

Eleanor Ainsworth adjusted her spectacles, her gaze sweeping across the bustling therapy room. Laughter mingled with the rhythmic clang of weights and the gentle whir of exercise machines. A sense of purpose permeated the space, a tangible testament to the resilience of the human spirit. Eleanor, a seasoned occupational therapist with a heart as big as her smile, felt a familiar surge of satisfaction.

Today's session promised to be particularly challenging. Her new patient, a young man named Leo Carter, had suffered a severe spinal cord injury in a motorcycle accident.  His world had been abruptly shrunk, his dreams and aspirations seemingly ripped away. Eleanor knew the road ahead would be long and arduous, but she was determined to help Leo reclaim as much of his independence as possible.

With a deep breath, Eleanor walked towards the curtained cubicle where Leo awaited her. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his fingers against the armrest filled the air, betraying both his impatience and his apprehension.  Eleanor knew this first meeting was crucial; it would set the tone for their journey together.
