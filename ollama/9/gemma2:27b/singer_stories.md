The air hung thick with humidity and anticipation, a palpable blanket over the dimly lit dive bar.  Neon signs buzzed outside, casting lurid streaks across the sticky floor, illuminating the sparse crowd gathered around rickety tables. On stage, bathed in the harsh spotlight of a single overhead bulb, stood Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather. Her voice, rough with emotion and years spent singing the blues away, filled every corner of the room, weaving tales of heartbreak and hope into each note.

Sera closed her eyes, her fingers dancing across the worn frets of her battered acoustic guitar. The melody swelled, a mournful cry that resonated deep within the souls of those who listened. For a moment, everyone was transfixed, lost in the raw power of her performance.
