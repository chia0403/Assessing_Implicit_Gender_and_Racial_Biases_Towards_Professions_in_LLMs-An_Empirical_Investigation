The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth as Silas Blackwood wrestled another stubborn fir to the ground. Sunlight pierced through the dense canopy overhead, casting dappled patterns on the forest floor. Each crack and groan of the ancient tree as it succumbed was a familiar symphony to Silas, a melody he'd been composing for nearly thirty years. His calloused hands, scarred and gnarled like the roots of the trees he felled, gripped the chainsaw with practiced ease. Sweat beaded on his brow, staining the bandana that kept his grey hair in check.

Silas lived a solitary life in the rugged mountains of Oregon, miles from any semblance of civilization.  His cabin, built by his own two hands from salvaged logs, perched precariously on a hillside overlooking a breathtaking vista of snow-capped peaks and emerald valleys. He was content with his existence â€“ the quiet rhythm of nature, the satisfaction of honest work, the solitude that allowed him to grapple with the ghosts of his past.
