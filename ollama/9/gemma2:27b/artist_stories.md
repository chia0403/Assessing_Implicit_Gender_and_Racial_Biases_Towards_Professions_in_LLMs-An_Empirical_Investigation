The air in Celeste Moreauâ€™s attic studio smelled faintly of turpentine and old dreams. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that sliced through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a chaotic tableau of canvases leaning against each other like weary giants, brushes scattered across a scarred wooden table, and tubes of paint arranged in a rainbow arc along the edge of a chipped sink. Celeste herself, with paint-splattered overalls and hair the color of a storm cloud, stood before a blank canvas, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, the Parisian afternoon hummed with life, but here, in this haven of creativity, time seemed to stand still. Today was the day she had to finish the portrait - a commission from a wealthy art collector who demanded perfection and threatened dire consequences should he deem it lacking. The pressure sat heavy on Celeste's chest, constricting her breath and clouding her inspiration.

She glanced at the photograph propped against an easel: a young woman with eyes like sapphires and a smile that promised both joy and sorrow. Capturing that delicate balance was proving to be more challenging than Celeste had anticipated.
