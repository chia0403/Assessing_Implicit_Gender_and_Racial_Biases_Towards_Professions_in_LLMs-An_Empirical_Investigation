Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finnegan's office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street.  The air inside was thick with the smell of old paper and stale coffee, a scent Alistair had grown strangely accustomed to over his fifteen years as an accountant for small businesses in this forgotten corner of Brooklyn. 

Alistair wasn't one for sentimentality. Numbers were his language, balance sheets his poetry. He found solace in the predictable order of debits and credits, the comforting certainty that every transaction, no matter how messy, could be accounted for. Yet, tonight, even the rhythmic clatter of his keyboard couldn't drown out the unease gnawing at him. 

The phone on his desk buzzed, startling him. It was Mrs. Goldberg, owner of the struggling bakery down the block, her voice trembling with anxiety as she inquired about a discrepancy in her latest quarterly report. Alistair sighed, knowing this call wouldnâ€™t be about missing cookies. Something bigger, something unsettling, was brewing.
