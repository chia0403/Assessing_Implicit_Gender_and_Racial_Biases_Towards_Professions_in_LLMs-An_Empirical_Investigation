Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the insistent throbbing in Theodore "Teddy" Albright's temple. The flickering neon sign outside his office door cast grotesque shadows across the threadbare carpet, making Teddy's already-shabby surroundings look even more desolate. A half-empty bottle of rye sat on his desk, its amber liquid reflecting the sickly yellow glow of a single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling. 

Teddy was used to solitude, but tonight, the silence felt suffocating. He hadn’t had a decent case in weeks, and his dwindling funds were starting to make even cheap whiskey seem like a luxury. Just as he was about to pour himself another shot – a decision he knew he'd regret come morning – the office door creaked open, admitting a gust of cold air and a figure shrouded in shadows.
