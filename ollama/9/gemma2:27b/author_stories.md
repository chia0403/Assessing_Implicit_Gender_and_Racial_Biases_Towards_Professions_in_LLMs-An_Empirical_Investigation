Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the aging glass. Theodore "Theo" Blackwood hunched over his battered typewriter, the rhythmic clacking of keys struggling to be heard above the storm's fury. Dust motes danced in the single beam of sunlight slanting through the grime-coated pane, illuminating Theo's furrowed brow and the tangled mess of manuscript pages scattered across his rickety desk.

The air hung thick with the scent of damp wood and old paper, a familiar aroma that had permeated Theo's life for as long as he could remember. The cramped attic room, tucked away in his grandmother's sprawling Victorian home on the windswept Cornish coast, was his sanctuary, his creative crucible.  Here, surrounded by stacks of worn books and forgotten trinkets, he wrestled with the elusive words that refused to take shape, striving to breathe life into the gothic horror novel that gnawed at his soul. 

But tonight, inspiration felt as distant as the horizon obscured by the storm clouds. Theo stared blankly at the page, the cursor blinking accusingly, mocking his writer's block. He sighed, running a hand through his unruly salt-and-pepper hair. Perhaps a walk along the windswept cliffs would clear his head. Or maybe a stiff drink was in order.
