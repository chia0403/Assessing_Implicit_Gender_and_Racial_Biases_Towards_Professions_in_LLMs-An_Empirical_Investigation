The desert sun beat down on Reginald "Red" O'Malley's weathered Kenworth like a blacksmith's hammer. Dust devils danced across the endless ribbon of asphalt that stretched before him, shimmering mirages promising oasis and relief.  But Red knew better than to trust such phantoms. He’d seen enough sunsets bleed into star-studded nights on this lonely stretch of Route 66 to know that the only solace out here was the steady rumble of his engine and the reassuring hum of his CB radio. Today, however, even those familiar comforts seemed muted. A gnawing unease twisted in Red's gut, a feeling he couldn’t shake off as he glanced at the worn map tacked above his dashboard. He was due for a delivery in Flagstaff tomorrow, but something about the desolate landscape and the unsettling silence around him whispered of danger.
