The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and diesel fumes as Eliza Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the chaos unfolding before her. The "Grand Opening" banner strung across the doorway of "Eliza's Escapes" flapped listlessly in the humid breeze, mocking her dreams of a smooth first day. 

Tourists milled about, their faces a mixture of confusion and impatience. A middle-aged couple bickered over brochures showcasing Tuscan vineyards, while a gaggle of teenagers crowded around Eliza's lone computer terminal, desperately trying to access Wi-Fi. The rhythmic clacking of her vintage typewriter, usually a source of comfort, was drowned out by the cacophony of voices and the insistent buzzing of ceiling fans struggling against the tropical heat.

Eliza sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow. She'd poured her heart and soul into this travel agency, envisioning it as a haven for wanderlust-stricken souls yearning to escape the mundane. But with malfunctioning air conditioning, a printer refusing to cooperate, and a seemingly endless queue of disgruntled customers, Eliza wondered if she'd bitten off more than she could chew.
