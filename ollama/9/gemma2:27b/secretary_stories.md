Rain lashed against the frosted glass panes of the Gotham Chronicle building, obscuring the twinkling city lights below. Eleanor Ainsworth, hunched over her Remington typewriter, barely noticed. The rhythmic clacking of keys was the only solace in the echoing emptiness of the late-night office. 

Eleanor's fingers danced across the aged ivory keys, transcribing a rambling article on the latest pigeon racing scandal into neat columns. Despite the mundane nature of the task, she couldn't help but feel a thrill. This newspaper, with its tattered edges and smell of stale ink, was her portal to a world beyond her small desk tucked away in the corner. She dreamt of being out there, notebook in hand, uncovering stories instead of simply transcribing them.  

Tonight, however, a sense of unease gnawed at Eleanor. The phone, usually silent after hours, had rung incessantly just before she arrived. Each call was cut short with a frantic "I'll be there soon!" from the editor, Mr. Harding, leaving Eleanor in a state of nervous anticipation. 


What happens next?
