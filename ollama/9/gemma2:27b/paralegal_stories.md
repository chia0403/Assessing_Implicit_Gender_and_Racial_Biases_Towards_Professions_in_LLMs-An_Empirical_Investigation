Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the law office, mimicking the storm brewing inside Eleanor Vance. The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across the cluttered desk piled high with case files.

Eleanor, a woman with steel-grey eyes that held a flicker of defiance despite the weariness etched around them, tapped her pen impatiently against a stack of witness statements. A paralegal for ten years at the firm of Henderson & Blackwood, she'd seen her fair share of legal battles, but this one felt different. The case, a wrongful death lawsuit against a powerful pharmaceutical company, had a weight to it that threatened to suffocate her. 

The victim, a young mother named Sarah Evans, had died after taking a new medication for chronic pain. The evidence pointed towards negligence on the part of the drug manufacturer, but proving it in court against their army of lawyers felt like an impossible feat. Eleanor stared at Sarah's photograph, a smiling woman cradling a giggling baby girl, and vowed to fight with everything she had.
