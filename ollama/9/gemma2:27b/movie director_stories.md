Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Flicker, a faded art deco cinema in downtown Los Angeles. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of popcorn and desperation. Elias Thorne, his salt-and-pepper hair plastered to his forehead, stared at the projector screen, its blank white expanse mocking him like an empty canvas.  

Elias was a man haunted by unrealized dreams. Once a darling of independent cinema, known for his gritty, atmospheric thrillers, he'd fallen from grace after a string of critical and commercial flops. Now, reduced to directing low-budget horror flicks for streaming services, he found himself questioning everything â€“ his talent, his choices, even the point of it all. 

Tonight was supposed to be different. This wasn't just another schlocky slasher film; it was a chance for Elias to reclaim his vision. A neo-noir thriller set in the neon-soaked underbelly of LA, it promised darkness, intrigue, and a touch of the macabre.  But as he sat there, the script lying open on the dusty table before him, doubt gnawed at his confidence. Could he truly pull this off? Or was he destined to be forever relegated to the shadows, a forgotten auteur haunted by what could have been?
