The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' barbershop was thick with the scent of bay rum and anticipation. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air above Bart's worn leather chair. Outside, Market Street bustled with the morning rush - housewives hurrying to the butcher's, children chasing pigeons, the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith hammering away at his forge. But inside the barbershop, time moved differently.

Bart, a man whose salt-and-pepper hair mirrored the stripes in his barber pole, worked with the quiet precision of a surgeon. He expertly wielded his straight razor, the silver blade glinting as it shaved away the rough stubble on Mr. Henderson's jawline.

Mr. Henderson, the town baker, was a fixture in Bart's chair every Tuesday morning. They chatted about the weather, the price of flour, and the upcoming Harvest Festival with the comfortable familiarity of old friends.


This morning, however, something was different. An unfamiliar tension hung in the air, a prickling sensation that made the hairs on Bart's neck stand on end. 

As he finished the shave and dusted Mr. Henderson with talcum powder, a shadow fell across the doorway. The shop bell chimed with an unsettling clang.
