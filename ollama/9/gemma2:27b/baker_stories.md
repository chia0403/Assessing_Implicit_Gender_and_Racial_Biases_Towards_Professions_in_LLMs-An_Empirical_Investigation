The air in "Le Petit Pain" hung thick with the scent of caramelized sugar and yeast. Eloise Dupont kneaded the sourdough dough with practiced hands, her movements rhythmic and precise. Dawn light streamed through the bakery window, illuminating the fine dusting of flour that coated everything: the worn wooden counter, the gleaming copper mixing bowls, even Eloise's freckled cheeks. Outside, Paris was still waking up, but Le Petit Pain was already humming with activity. The ovens roared, sending waves of heat against Eloiseâ€™s back, and the clinking of trays filled with croissants and pain au chocolat punctuated the quiet morning. Today was a special day - Bastille Day - and Eloise had spent the past week crafting elaborate pastries to celebrate:  tricolor macarons, miniature Eiffel Towers sculpted from gingerbread, and her signature brioche, studded with plump cherries and dusted with powdered sugar. 


But as Eloise carefully shaped the final baguette, a shadow fell across the doorway. Her heart skipped a beat. It was him. The man with eyes the color of melted chocolate and a smile that could melt butter.
