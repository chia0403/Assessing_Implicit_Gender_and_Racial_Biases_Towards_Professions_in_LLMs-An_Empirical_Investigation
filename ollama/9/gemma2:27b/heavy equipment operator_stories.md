The pre-dawn air hung thick with diesel fumes and the scent of pine needles. Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley squinted through the windshield of his Caterpillar D9 bulldozer, its massive yellow frame casting an elongated shadow across the dusty clearing. The roar of the engine reverberated through his bones, a familiar lullaby he'd woken up to for the past twenty years.

He was nestled deep in the Cascade Mountains, miles from any town, carving out a new logging road through dense old-growth forest.  Towering Douglas firs and Ponderosa pines cast long shadows, their branches reaching towards the bruised purple sky like skeletal fingers. 


Bart inhaled deeply, the crisp mountain air filling his lungs with a sense of invigorating solitude. He loved this work â€“ the raw power of the machine beneath him, the satisfying crunch of timber as he pushed through the undergrowth, the knowledge that he was leaving his mark on this wild landscape.
