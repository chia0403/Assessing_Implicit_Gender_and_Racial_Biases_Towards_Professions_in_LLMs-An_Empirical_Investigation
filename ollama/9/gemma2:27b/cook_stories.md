The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and woodsmoke, a familiar symphony to Elias Thornewood's senses.  He stood in the heart of his domain: a ramshackle kitchen nestled within the ancient stone walls of The Crooked Chimney, a tavern perched precariously on the edge of Whispering Gorge. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping snow into frenzied swirls against the leaded windows.

Elias, a man whose weathered face mirrored the craggy landscape beyond his doorstep, stirred a bubbling cauldron with practiced ease. His hands, gnarled from years spent wielding cleavers and whisks, moved with the grace of a seasoned dancer. Tonight's menu was simple: venison stew, roasted root vegetables, and crusty bread still warm from the hearth. 


But something felt amiss. A disquiet hummed beneath Elias' usual calm, an unsettling premonition that whispered through the clattering pans and crackling fire. It wasn't the storm raging outside; he'd weathered countless blizzards in his years at The Crooked Chimney. This was different. Something darker loomed on the horizon, a threat as palpable as the icy wind seeping through the cracks in the ancient stone walls.
