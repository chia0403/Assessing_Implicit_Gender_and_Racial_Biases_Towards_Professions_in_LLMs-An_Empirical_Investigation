Rain lashed against the warped windowpane, mimicking the frantic beating in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest.  The antique clock on her cluttered desk ticked with an infuriating slowness. 5:47 pm. Three minutes until she was supposed to leave for her niece’s birthday party, and she was still knee-deep in notes from a particularly unsettling session.

Eleanor’s cramped office felt like a pressure cooker tonight.  The air hung heavy with the weight of unspoken anxieties and suppressed traumas, remnants of the day's patients lingering like ghosts.  Her sanctuary, usually a space of calm and understanding, now seemed to echo with their troubled whispers. She craved the escape promised by her niece’s laughter and brightly colored balloons, but the image of Mrs. Davenport's haunted eyes kept flickering in her mind. 

Mrs. Davenport had arrived this afternoon, consumed by an unshakeable fear that something terrible was about to happen. It wasn’t a rational fear, Eleanor knew, but it felt visceral, real. As Eleanor delved deeper, she unearthed a childhood trauma Mrs. Davenport had buried for decades – a nightmare reliving itself in her waking hours. The weight of responsibility pressed on Eleanor; could she help Mrs. Davenport break free from the chains of her past before something truly terrible did happen?
