The air in Le Petit Coq was thick with the scent of roasting garlic and thyme, punctuated by the sharp tang of lemon juice. Outside, the Parisian twilight was settling, casting long shadows across the cobblestone street. Inside, Genevieve Dubois, her fiery red hair pulled back in a severe bun, surveyed the chaos of her kitchen with a critical eye. Pots bubbled on the stovetop, whisks danced furiously in bowls, and a symphony of clanging pans and sizzling meat filled the air.  Genevieve's hands, calloused but nimble, expertly diced shallots while she barked orders at her sous chef, Pierre. Tonight was no ordinary night; it was the night Le Petit Coq would be reviewed by Antoine Moreau, the notoriously sharp-tongued food critic for Le Monde. Genevieveâ€™s heart hammered in her chest, a drumbeat of anxiety beneath the clatter of the kitchen. This review could make or break her restaurant, her dream.
