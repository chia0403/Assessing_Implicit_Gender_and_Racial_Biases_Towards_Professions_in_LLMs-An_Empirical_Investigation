Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the vibrant mural depicting fruits and vegetables dancing on the sidewalk outside. Inside, Evangeline Willowbrook sighed, her gaze flickering between the overflowing inbox and the ticking clock. A steady stream of appointments filled her day, but a gnawing unease twisted in her stomach. 

Evangeline wasn't your typical nutritionist. While she championed kale smoothies and quinoa bowls with unwavering enthusiasm, her approach went beyond calories and macros. She believed in understanding the individual: their struggles, their joys, their deeply ingrained relationships with food. But lately, something felt off. A new wave of clients came seeking solace not just for physical health but for emotional well-being, wrestling with anxieties she felt ill-equipped to address.  

The chime above the door announced a new arrival, momentarily drawing Evangeline from her thoughts. She plastered on her warmest smile, ready to greet whoever walked through the rain-streaked doorway. Little did she know, this arrival would shatter her carefully constructed world and plunge her into a mystery that intertwined nutrition, ancient rituals, and the very essence of human connection.
