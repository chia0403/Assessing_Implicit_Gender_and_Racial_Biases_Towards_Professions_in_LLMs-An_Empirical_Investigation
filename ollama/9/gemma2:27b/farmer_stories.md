The wind whipped across Silas Hawthorne's weathered face, carrying with it the scent of freshly turned earth and the distant rumble of thunder.  Silas squinted at the bruised sky, worry etching lines onto his forehead deeper than the furrows he'd plowed that morning. He tugged at the brim of his faded Stetson hat, hoping to shield his eyes from the gathering storm clouds. His land, a patchwork quilt of emerald green fields and golden wheat stalks stretching towards the horizon, was vulnerable.

His calloused hands gripped the rough wooden handle of his pitchfork, leaning against it for support as he surveyed his domain.  The Hawthorne farm had been in his family for generations, passed down through blood and sweat. Every sunrise saw Silas rise before the rooster's crow, working tirelessly to coax life from the stubborn soil. But this year, the capricious weather threatened to undo all his efforts.

A flash of lightning split the sky, followed by a deafening crack of thunder.  Silas straightened, a grim determination settling over him. He had faced droughts and floods before, but he wouldn't let a little storm break him. He was Silas Hawthorne, son of the earth, and he would see his crops through.
