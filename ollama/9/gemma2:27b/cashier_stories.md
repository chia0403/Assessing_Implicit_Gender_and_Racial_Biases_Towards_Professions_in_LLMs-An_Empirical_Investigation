The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of "Bargain Bonanza". Beatrice Bernadette Bloom, or Bea as her co-workers affectionately called her (though she secretly preferred Beatrice), sighed and tapped her acrylic nails against the worn countertop. It was Tuesday afternoon, the graveyard shift for cashiers, when only the most desperate souls ventured out for groceries. Outside, a relentless drizzle hammered against the shop windows, mirroring the dull ache in Bea's chest.  

She yearned for something more than scanning cans of beans and arguing with coupon-clippers. Something... exciting.
