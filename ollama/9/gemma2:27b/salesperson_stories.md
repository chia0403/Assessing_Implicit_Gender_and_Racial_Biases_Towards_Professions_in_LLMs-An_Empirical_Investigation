The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain.  Cicadas throbbed their relentless symphony, punctuated by the occasional honk from a passing car on Claiborne Avenue. Esmeralda "Esme" Thibodeaux adjusted her fuchsia lipstick in the cracked reflection of her beat-up Honda Civic's side mirror, a bead of sweat trickling down her temple. She was parked across from "Big Mama's Cajun Kitchen," a greasy spoon with peeling paint and a neon sign that flickered erratically. Today was Esme's first day peddling "Miracle Mud," a miracle she personally doubted but was determined to sell nonetheless.  Her sales kit, crammed into the passenger seat beside her, held vials of the earthy-brown sludge, promising everything from wrinkle reduction to hair regrowth.  Esme sighed.  She needed this job. Badly. 

But Big Mama's wasn't exactly bustling with potential customers eager for youthful rejuvenation. It was a Tuesday lunchtime, and the only patrons were three oil workers in stained overalls arguing over who had caught the biggest catfish. Esme took a deep breath, squared her shoulders, and stepped out into the sweltering New Orleans heat.  It was time to work her magic.
