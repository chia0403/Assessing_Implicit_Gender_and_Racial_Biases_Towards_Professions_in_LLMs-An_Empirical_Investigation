The flickering fluorescent lights of Northwood High's guidance office cast long shadows across the worn beige carpet. A faint scent of stale coffee lingered in the air, battling for dominance with the ever-present aroma of anxiety emanating from the teenagers huddled on mismatched chairs. Amelia Cartwright sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she glanced at the clock. 3:15 pm. Just fifteen minutes until the final bell rang and the tide of adolescent angst receded for another day.  

Amelia loved her job, truly she did. Helping students navigate the treacherous waters of high school – from college applications to social dilemmas to crippling self-doubt – was a calling, not just a career. But some days, like this one, felt heavier than others. Today, it was the palpable dread in the room that weighed on Amelia’s soul.

A knock on her door startled her from her reverie.  "Come in," she called out, straightening her floral blouse and bracing herself for whatever emotional rollercoaster awaited her next.
