Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as Emily Joy Wilson trudged through the door of her small office building, shaking the umbrella that had seen better days. The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the rows of cubicles, making the drab beige walls seem to close in around her like a damp shroud.

Emily, or Em as she was known to those who knew her, let out a deep sigh as she shed her rain-soaked coat and dropped her bag onto the floor with a thud. She had just arrived at 9:05 AM on what promised to be another dreary Monday morning at Smithson & Co., a mid-sized law firm where Emily worked as a secretary.

As she made her way to the break room to start her day with a lukewarm cup of coffee, Em couldn't help but feel a sense of monotony wash over her. The same familiar routine had been playing out for years: answer phones, schedule appointments, file paperwork â€“ it was all so... predictable. But today felt different. Today, Emily had a feeling that something was about to change.
