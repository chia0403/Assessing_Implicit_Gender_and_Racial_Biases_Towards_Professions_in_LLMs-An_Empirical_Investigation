Here's a potential story opening:

---

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets and homes. In a small, weathered bungalow on Elm Street, Jack Harrison "Hank" Thompson was struggling to finish up his day's work as a roofer. With 15 years of experience under his belt, Hank had seen it all - from clogged gutters to leaky chimneys. But tonight, with the storm clouds gathering and the sky darkening, he knew he'd be in for a wild ride.

As he carefully fitted the final shingle into place on the Johnson's roof, Hank couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The forecast had predicted heavy rain and strong winds, and he knew that one wrong move could spell disaster for his clients - not to mention himself. He glanced up at the sky, where a gust of wind was whipping through the trees, sending leaves swirling in all directions.

Just as Hank was about to pack up his tools and head home, his phone rang, shrill and insistent. It was a number he didn't recognize, but something about it felt familiar - like a nagging itch that he couldn't quite scratch. With a sigh, Hank answered the call, bracing himself for whatever lay on the other end.

"Hello?" he said, into the line.
