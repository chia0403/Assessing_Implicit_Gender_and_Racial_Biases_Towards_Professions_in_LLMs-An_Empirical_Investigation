Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare over the rows of dusty lockers, each one bearing the faded initials of students long gone. The air was thick with the smell of old sweat and stale air, a constant reminder that this wasn't a place of learning, but rather a relic of the past.

Axel James "AJ" Thompson trudged through the deserted hallway, his worn sneakers making soft scuffing sounds on the linoleum floor. He pushed a cart of cleaning supplies behind him, the wheels creaking as he navigated the narrow passageway. As the school's janitor, AJ had spent countless hours in this very corridor, scrubbing down surfaces and sweeping up crumbs.

It was a job that allowed him to keep to himself, to observe without being observed. But despite the solitude, AJ felt a sense of unease creeping over him as he made his way towards his favorite corner of the school: the old library. The door creaked open with a soft sigh, revealing rows upon rows of forgotten books and dusty relics that seemed to whisper secrets in the silence.

AJ had always been fascinated by this place, where time itself seemed to have slowed down. As he began to sweep the floor, his gaze drifted over the shelves, running his fingers over the spines of the old textbooks and dog-eared paperbacks. It was here that AJ felt most alive, as if the weight of the world was momentarily lifted off his shoulders.

Little did he know, however, that today would be different. Today would mark the beginning of a journey that would shake everything he thought he knew about himself and this crumbling old building.
