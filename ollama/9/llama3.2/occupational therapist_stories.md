Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the window of her small apartment, gazing out at the rain-soaked streets of Portland, Oregon. The sound of the droplets hitting the pavement was a familiar lullaby to Lexi, who had grown up in this city and had spent countless hours exploring its neighborhoods as a child.

As an occupational therapist specializing in adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), Lexi had seen her fair share of struggles. But it was the quiet moments like these, when she could let her thoughts wander without the distractions of the day's work, that allowed her to feel most grounded.

Lexi took a deep breath and turned away from the window, running a hand through her curly brown hair. She made herself a cup of tea and sat down at her cluttered desk, where stacks of medical journals and case files waited for her attention. It was going to be one of those days - she could feel it.

The phone on her desk rang out, shrill in the silence. Lexi smiled wryly as she picked up the receiver, knowing that whatever news or concerns came with it would only add fuel to the fire that had been building inside her for weeks.

"Hello?" she said, already sensing the uncertainty in her own voice.

And then, just as she was about to launch into a smooth apology, Lexi heard the unmistakable tone of her client, 35-year-old Ryan Jenkins.
