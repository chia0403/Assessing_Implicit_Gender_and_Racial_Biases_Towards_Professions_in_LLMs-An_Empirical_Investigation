Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp blanket. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the streets were empty save for the few stragglers hurrying home from the local pub or seeking refuge in their own homes.

In a small kitchen above the pub, Emilia Rose Winters stirred a bubbling pot of bouillabaisse, her hands moving with a practiced ease that belied the doubts that had been nagging at her all day. She was a chef at the age of 25, having started out as an apprentice in a Michelin-starred restaurant in Paris and worked her way up to become one of Ravenswood's top culinary talents.

The pub, where Emilia worked as the head chef, was a cozy, family-owned place that had been around for generations. It was a hub of community activity, with locals gathering there every evening after work to share stories and enjoy a pint or two. But tonight, something felt off. The wind howled through the streets like a wolf, and Emilia could sense that it was more than just the weather causing the unease.

As she stirred the bouillabaisse, Emilia's mind kept drifting back to the phone call she had received earlier in the day. It was from an old friend, a food blogger who had recently returned to Ravenswood after years abroad. The message had been cryptic - "Meet me at the lighthouse at midnight. Come alone."
