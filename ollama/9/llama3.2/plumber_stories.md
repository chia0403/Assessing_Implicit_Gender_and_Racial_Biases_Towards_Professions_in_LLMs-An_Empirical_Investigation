Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain pounded against the rusty pipes of the old building, causing the creaks and groans to echo through the deserted corridors like a chorus of restless spirits. In a cramped, dimly lit alleyway behind the building, the flickering fluorescent lights above seemed to cast an eerie glow on the figure huddled over his toolbox.

This was Jack Edwin "Hank" Thompson, a gruff but lovable plumber in his mid-forties with a thick beard and a perpetual air of exhaustion around him. Hank had spent years working for various plumbing companies, fixing leaky faucets and unclogging drains for the good people of Ashwood City. But despite his tough exterior, he had always felt like there was something missing - a sense of purpose, perhaps, or a mystery to solve.

As he tinkered with the pipes beneath the old building's foundation, Hank couldn't shake the feeling that this particular job might be more than just a routine repair. The building's owner, a reclusive millionaire named Henry Winters, had been acting strange in the days leading up to this visit - nervous and agitated, always seemed to be checking his watch or glancing over his shoulder as if he expected someone to burst out of nowhere at any moment.

Hank shrugged off the feeling, telling himself it was just his imagination playing tricks on him. But as he tightened a final bolt and stood up, brushing off the grime from his hands, he couldn't help but wonder what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of this old building - and whether he'd be brave enough to uncover them.
