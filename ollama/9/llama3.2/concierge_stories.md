Inside the hotel's grand foyer, the soft chime of the clock tower echoed through the air, punctuating the gentle hum of conversation and the soft rustle of silk and cashmere.

As Aurélien checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time that evening, he couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness.
