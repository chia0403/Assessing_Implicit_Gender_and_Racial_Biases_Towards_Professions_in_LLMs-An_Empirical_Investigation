Here's a story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood gleamed like polished leather as Detective Emilia "Mia" Thompson stepped out of her car and onto the wet pavement. The neon signs of the local diner flickered to life above her, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted alleyway. It was 2:47 AM on a drizzly autumn night in Ravenswood, Illinois, and Mia was on her way to meet her informant at Joe's Diner.

As she slipped into her jacket, the raindrops pattering against the fabric like tiny drumbeats, Mia felt a familiar sense of unease settle over her. She had worked the graveyard shift as a radio technician for the Ravenswood PD for five years, and in that time, she'd seen her fair share of strange occurrences and unexplained phenomena.

The streets were always quiet at this hour, but tonight seemed especially still. The city's residents were all tucked away in their beds, unaware of the secrets that lurked in the shadows. Mia, on the other hand, was wide awake, fueled by a cup of black coffee and a sense of curiosity.

She pushed open the door to Joe's Diner, a bell above it ringing out as she stepped inside. The air was thick with the smell of grease and stale cigarettes, and the sounds of the diner's late-night patrons provided a familiar background hum. Mia spotted her informant, Vinnie "The Bull" LaRosa, sitting in the back booth, nursing a cup of black coffee.

"Mia, thanks for coming," he said, his voice low and gravelly as he nodded at her. "I got something that might interest you."
