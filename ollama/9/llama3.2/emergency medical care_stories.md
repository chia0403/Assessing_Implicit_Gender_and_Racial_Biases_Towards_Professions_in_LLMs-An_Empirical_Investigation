Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

Dr. Maya Alexandra Jensen, a seasoned emergency medical technician (EMT), stood at the edge of the makeshift field hospital, gazing out at the sea of faces stretching before her. The sun had long since set over the ravaged landscape, casting a golden glow over the devastation. The air was thick with the acrid scent of smoke and ash, and the distant rumble of thunder echoed through the valley.

It was 3 AM on a sweltering summer night in August, and Maya's team from the emergency response unit had been deployed to this remote area of New Mexico, where a devastating wildfire had ravaged the local community. The terrain was arid and unforgiving, with rocky outcroppings and scrubby desert plants that seemed to writhe in the flickering light of the generators.

Maya's eyes scanned the makeshift tents, her mind racing with the latest reports from the scene. Dozens of people had been injured or displaced, many with serious burns or traumatic injuries. As she surveyed the chaos, Maya felt a sense of unease creeping over her. She knew that every minute counted in this situation â€“ and she was determined to do everything in her power to save as many lives as possible.

With a deep breath, Maya turned to face her team, her voice steady as she called out orders for the night's shift. "Alright, people, let's get moving! We've got patients to treat and a long night ahead of us."
