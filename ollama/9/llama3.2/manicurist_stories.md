As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the dusty streets of Tokyo's Golden Gai district, Naomi Katsuragi slipped into her favorite after-work ritual: the tranquil world of nail polish and chatter. With a deft touch, she transformed tired hands into works of art at her small, unassuming salon nestled between a vintage clothing store and a ramen shop.

The sign above the door read "Koko's Korner" in elegant calligraphy, a name Naomi had coined for herself years ago as a nod to her grandmother, who had taught her the delicate dance of Japanese nail art. As she began to prep for the evening rush, the soft hum of jazz music and the gentle chatter of her clients created a haven from the chaos outside.

Tonight was different, however. Tonight, Naomi's thoughts were preoccupied with the news she'd received just that morning: the owner of Koko's Korner, her mentor and mother figure, had fallen ill, leaving Naomi to take on the responsibilities of running the salon alone. The weight of this new responsibility settled onto her shoulders like a fresh layer of polish â€“ a task both exhilarating and terrifying as she prepared to face the unknown challenges that lay ahead.
