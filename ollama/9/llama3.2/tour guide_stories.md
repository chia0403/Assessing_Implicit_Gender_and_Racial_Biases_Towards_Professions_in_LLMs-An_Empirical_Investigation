Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. The air was thick with the scent of frankincense and myrrh, carried on the whispers of a thousand midnights past.

Amidst this mystical landscape, Alexandria "Lexi" Thompson stood poised at the edge of the crowd, surveying the sea of tourists gathered before her. A veteran tour guide with over a decade of experience under her belt, Lexi had seen it all - from awestruck wonder to outright disillusionment. She knew every twist and turn of the Siq, every hidden corner and secret passage that lay beyond the tourist trail.

With a sharp eye for detail and an encyclopedic knowledge of Petra's rich history, Lexi was the go-to guide for intrepid travelers seeking a deeper connection with this ancient city. And yet, despite her many successes, she couldn't shake the feeling that this particular group - a ragtag bunch of honeymooners, adventure-seekers, and armchair archaeologists - was about to stir up more trouble than excitement.

As she waited for the group to assemble, Lexi's gaze drifted out across the canyon, where the setting sun was slowly revealing the towering facade of Al-Khazneh, the Treasury. It was a sight that never failed to move her, this ancient wonder of the world - a testament to the ingenuity and craftsmanship of long-lost civilizations.

But tonight, something felt different. Tonight, Lexi sensed that the past was about to collide with the present in ways she couldn't yet imagine...
