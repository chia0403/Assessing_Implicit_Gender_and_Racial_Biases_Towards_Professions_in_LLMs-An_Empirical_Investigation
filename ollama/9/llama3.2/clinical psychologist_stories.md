Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp autumn morning, gazing up at the grey sky that seemed to mirror her mood. The leaves on the nearby trees had long since fallen, leaving behind a layer of crunching gravel beneath her feet as she made her way to the parking lot.

As a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma and anxiety disorders, Lexi was no stranger to the darker corners of human psychology. She had spent years studying the effects of PTSD, anxiety, and depression on individuals and families, and had developed a keen ear for the subtle signs of emotional distress that often went unnoticed by those around them.

Lexi lived in Portland, Oregon, a city known for its quirky vibe and eclectic mix of artists, musicians, and writers. But despite its reputation as a haven for creative types, Lexi found herself drawn to the quiet desperation of her patients, who struggled to find their footing in a world that seemed increasingly unpredictable and terrifying.

Today was no exception. As she climbed into her car and started the engine, Lexi felt a familiar sense of unease building in the pit of her stomach. She had a patient appointment scheduled later in the day, one that she had been dreading for weeks. It seemed that another young woman had arrived in town, fleeing some unknown terror from her past, and was now seeking out Lexi's expertise to help her unravel the tangled threads of her own trauma.

Lexi took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for the emotional rollercoaster that lay ahead. She knew that the next few hours would be intense, but she was ready. After all, it was in these darkest of moments that people found the courage to confront their deepest fears and begin the long journey towards healing.
