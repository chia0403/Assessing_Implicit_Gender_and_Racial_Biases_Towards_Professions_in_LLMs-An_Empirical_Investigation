Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The city streets were always alive with energy at night, but for Emily Elizabeth Patel, the vibrant lights and bustling crowds were just a reminder that another day was done. As she walked out of the office building where she worked as a sales representative for a pharmaceutical company, the cool evening air hit her like a slap in the face, invigorating her senses after hours spent staring at spreadsheets and pitching to skeptical clients.

Emily Elizabeth Patel, or Emi to those who knew her well, had always been driven by one thing: making it to the top. Growing up in a family of modest means, she'd learned early on that hard work and determination were the keys to success. And now, at 28 years old, she was finally starting to see her hard work pay off. She'd just landed a major deal with a big pharmaceutical firm, one that would catapult her career into the stratosphere.

But as Emi turned onto the sidewalk, her phone buzzing in her pocket and her mind racing with thoughts of the next day's sales calls, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The usually reliable GPS on her phone was taking a weird detour, leading her down alleys and side streets that seemed to appear out of nowhere. And then there were the strange whispers - faint, but unmistakable - that seemed to follow her wherever she went.

It wasn't until Emi stopped in front of the small diner where she always grabbed breakfast on her way to work that the whispers grew loud enough for her to make out: "Get out while you still can."
