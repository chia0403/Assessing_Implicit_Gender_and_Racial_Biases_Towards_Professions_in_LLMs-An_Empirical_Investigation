Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in October 2015, and journalist Emilia Rose Flynn stood outside the crumbling mansion on Willow Creek Road, her eyes fixed on the peeling paint and overgrown gardens that seemed to whisper tales of secrets and scandals past. The once-grand estate had been the residence of the reclusive and enigmatic millionaire, Henry Blackwood, who had died suddenly under mysterious circumstances three months prior.

Emilia, a tenacious and intrepid investigative journalist for the local paper, had received a cryptic letter from an anonymous source claiming to have information about Blackwood's final days. The letter read: "Look again at the truth you thought you knew. Meet me at Willow Creek Road at midnight if you dare."

As Emilia lit her cigarette and took a long drag, she couldn't shake the feeling that this tip was more than just another wild goose chase. Something about the words seemed to resonate deep within her, echoing a nagging sense of discontent that had been growing inside her since she'd first started working on Blackwood's story.

She glanced around at the deserted streets, the only sound being the distant hum of a passing car and the soft patter of raindrops on the pavement. The clock on her watch read 11:47 PM. She took another drag, her heart racing with anticipation, and stepped out into the darkness to uncover the secrets that lay hidden in the shadows of Willow Creek Road.
