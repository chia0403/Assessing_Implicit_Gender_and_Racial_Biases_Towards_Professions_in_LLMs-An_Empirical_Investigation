The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on Amelia Beatrice Finchâ€™s workspace.  Amelia, a whirlwind of efficiency even at 7:30 am, was already prepping for her first patient. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and peppermint mouthwash, a scent that had become as familiar to her as the smell of freshly cut grass after a summer rain.

Her dental practice, nestled in a quiet suburb just outside the bustling heart of Denver, felt more like a sanctuary than a typical office. Sunbeams slanted through the skylights, illuminating the vibrant blue and green accents on the walls. Calming nature scenes adorned the waiting area, replacing the usual medical posters with landscapes that promised tranquility. 

It was this serenity Amelia aimed to provide, not just clean teeth. She believed in treating patients like people, remembering birthdays, offering a kind word, a listening ear. Today, however, she felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Mrs. Henderson, the practice's oldest and most beloved patient, was due for a check-up, and Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.
