The air in Blush Beauty Bar was thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and ambition.  Sunlight streamed through the large storefront windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid Miami air. The sound of rhythmic hair dryers buzzed, punctuated by bursts of excited chatter and the soft strumming of a ukulele from the corner where Amelia "Amy" Celeste Diaz was expertly braiding her client's hair.

Amy, a woman with a smile as bright as the fuchsia walls that lined her salon, hummed along to the music, her nimble fingers weaving intricate patterns into the dark strands.  She loved this part of her job - the quiet intimacy of transforming a head of hair into a work of art, the trust and connection she forged with each client who sat in her chair. 


But today, there was a tremor of unease beneath Amy's sunny disposition. A flyer pinned to the community board caught her eye â€“ "Salon Owner Wanted: Prime Location."  The words seemed to whisper a challenge, a ripple in the calm waters of her carefully built life. 


What if...what if she didn't just work at Blush Beauty Bar? What if she owned it?
