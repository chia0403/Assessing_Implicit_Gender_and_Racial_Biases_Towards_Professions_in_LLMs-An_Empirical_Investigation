The stale aroma of recycled air hung heavy in the aisle as Amelia "Amy" Rose adjusted her headset. The engine's hum vibrated through the cabin floor, a constant reminder that they were hurtling towards Chicago at 35,000 feet. Below, clouds swirled like cotton candy, obscuring the familiar patchwork quilt of fields and towns. It was a mundane Tuesday flight, just another leg in her cross-country rotation for Skyward Airlines.

But something felt different today. A prickle of anticipation danced on Amy's skin, a feeling she usually reserved for flights over the Grand Canyon or when she spotted an unexpected celebrity boarding. 

This time, it was the passenger list that had her buzzing.  One name, circled in red ink by the senior flight attendant, stuck out like a beacon: "Victor Thorne." He was a reclusive tech billionaire, rumored to be working on something groundbreaking â€“ a project shrouded in secrecy. Amy couldn't help but wonder what secrets he carried with him onboard this seemingly ordinary flight.  


Would she be bold enough to find out?
