The polished mahogany gleamed under Agnes Thistlebottom's watchful eye as she buffed it with a meticulous flourish. The afternoon sun, slanting through the French doors overlooking the sprawling English garden, cast long shadows across the grand hall of Blackwood Manor.  Agnes hummed softly to herself, her nimble fingers moving with practiced ease over the antique surface. She knew every inch of this house, from the intricate carvings on the fireplace mantel to the faint scuff marks on the Persian rug in the drawing room. It was her domain, a world meticulously maintained beneath the watchful gaze of its absent occupants. 

Blackwood Manor itself felt like a character, breathing with the weight of generations past. Agnes had worked there since she was a girl, her parents having served the Blackwood family before her. The house held both comfort and melancholy for her - the comforting rhythm of routine, the echo of laughter in empty rooms, and the lingering scent of lavender that Mrs. Blackwood used to wear. Today, however,  a new tension hummed beneath the usual quietude. It was the day Mr. Blackwood returned after a long absence, bringing with him whispers of secrets and anxieties. Agnes felt it in the air, a subtle shift in the house's very essence.
