The bell above Aisling O’Malley's salon door tinkled, announcing another customer into the symphony of buzzing shears and whirring hairdryers. 

Aisling, perched on her usual stool at the back, glanced up from her client's meticulously curled hair. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, casting a warm glow over the mismatched chairs and vibrant murals that adorned the walls. The air was thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and jasmine conditioner, a comforting blend Aisling had perfected after years of mixing her own concoctions. 

The newcomer was a young woman, barely out of her teens, with wide, nervous eyes and a tangle of dark hair that seemed to defy gravity. She clutched a crumpled flyer in her hand, its faded colours revealing the promise of "A New You" at Aisling's Salon on Maple Street.  

Aisling smiled warmly, her Irish brogue as comforting as the familiar scents swirling around them. "Welcome," she said, gesturing towards the waiting area. "What can I do for you?"
