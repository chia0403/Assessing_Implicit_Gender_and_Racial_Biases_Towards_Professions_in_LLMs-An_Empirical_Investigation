The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Jones's domain: aisle six of Save-Rite Grocery. The shelves groaned under the weight of canned peaches and discounted ramen, their labels faded and peeling like sunburnt skin. Amy meticulously rearranged a pyramid of discount cereal boxes, her name tag - neatly printed in black on an ugly lime green fabric - bouncing slightly with each movement. A symphony of clanks and hums filled the air: the whirring of the refrigerator behind her, the rhythmic beeping of the scanners at checkout, and the incessant buzz of the intercom announcing "Attention shoppers, we're running low on bread." 

Amy sighed.  It was a Tuesday afternoon in July, a slow period for Save-Rite, but that didn't mean it was peaceful. It just meant more time to hear Mrs. Henderson grumble about the price of frozen peas and witness Mr. Rodriguezâ€™s epic struggle to choose between generic ketchup and Heinz. She glanced at her reflection in the dusty glass of the cereal aisle. Her blonde hair, usually tied back in a messy bun, had escaped its confines, framing tired blue eyes that seemed older than her twenty-two years. 


A loud crash jolted her from her thoughts.  Mrs. Henderson's shopping cart, laden with discount soup and overripe bananas, had taken a tumble near the dairy section. Amy exchanged a knowing look with the young stockboy nearby. This was going to be interesting.
