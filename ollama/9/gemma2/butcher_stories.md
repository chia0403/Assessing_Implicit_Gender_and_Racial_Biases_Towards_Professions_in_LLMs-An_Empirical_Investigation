The pungent aroma of blood and iron hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent to Bartholomew "Bart" Cleaver as he surveyed his domain. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of "Cleaver & Sons," illuminating dust motes dancing in the cool morning air. The shop was a haven of worn butcher blocks, gleaming cleavers, and hanging carcasses, their stillness belying the symphony of sizzling fat and clanging metal that would erupt later that day. 

Bart ran a calloused hand over the cold steel of his grandfather's prized butcher knife, its blade still sharp as the day it was forged. He felt a pang of melancholy, remembering how his father used to stand beside him, their hands moving in a practiced ballet of flesh and bone. Now, Bart stood alone, a solitary guardian of this fading legacy, wrestling with the rising tide of supermarket convenience that threatened to wash away everything he held dear. 


The morning was quiet, save for the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock and the distant rumble of delivery trucks navigating the cobblestone streets outside.
