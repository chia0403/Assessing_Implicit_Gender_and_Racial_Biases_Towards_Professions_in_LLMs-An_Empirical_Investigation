The rain hammered on the corrugated iron roof of Silas Blackwood's office, each drop a miniature drumbeat against the symphony of dripping pipes and crackling static from the antiquated radio in the corner.  Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow light filtering through the grimy windows of his third-floor walk-up in the heart of New Albion City's perpetually overcast Undercity. It wasn't exactly glamorous, but Silas Blackwood, PI, preferred it that way. Less glitter meant less scrutiny, and fewer questions about the chipped enamel on his worn detective badge, a relic from his brief stint with the city police before reality had punched him square in the gut and left him disillusioned. 

The phone on his desk, a hulking monstrosity cobbled together from scavenged parts, buzzed insistently. Silas snatched it up, his voice raspy from days of cheap whiskey and sleepless nights. "Blackwood. What's your problem?"  


He was about to hang up when the voice on the other end, tinny and laced with desperation, made him pause.

"Mr. Blackwood," the voice pleaded, "They say you can find anything. I need your help."
