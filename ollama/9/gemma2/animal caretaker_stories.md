The morning mist clung to Willow Creek Sanctuary like a damp blanket, muffling the usual symphony of bird calls and rustling leaves. Inside the weathered barn, Amelia "Amy" Cloverthorn hunched over a bucket, meticulously scrubbing out her tools with a ferocity that rivaled the rooster crowing outside.  

The sanctuary, nestled in the rolling hills of Oregon's Willamette Valley, was Amy's haven. It wasn't always glamorous - dealing with stubborn goats, temperamental llamas, and the occasional escaped peacock was hardly a walk in the park. But for Amy, it was everything she ever wanted: a place where rescued animals could find solace, care, and a second chance at happiness. 


Today, however, felt different. A knot of unease twisted in Amy's gut, tighter than the laces on her worn leather boots. There was a silence in the barn, an unnatural stillness that spoke of something amiss.  Her gaze swept over the familiar faces: Patches the one-eyed pig snoozing in his hay bale, Buttercup the rescued Clydesdale munching on oats, and even Jasper the mischievous raccoon, usually bouncing off the walls, sat unusually still.


Amy's heart pounded a worried rhythm against her ribs. Something was wrong, she could feel it in her bones.
