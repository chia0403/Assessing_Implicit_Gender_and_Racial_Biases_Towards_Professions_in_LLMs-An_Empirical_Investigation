The sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Harper's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat plastered her faded blue work shirt to her back, each bead of perspiration tracing a path through the dust that clung to her skin. The endless ribbon of asphalt stretched before her, shimmering under the relentless July heat.  She squinted at the horizon, where the hazy line between sky and land blurred into an indistinguishable mass.

Amy adjusted her hardhat, its brim offering little respite from the sun's glare. Her gloved hand rested on the handle of her shovel, a familiar weight in the landscape of dust and asphalt that was her world. She worked for the Department of Transportation, a solitary figure in a vast expanse of nothing but road. Every day was the same: patching potholes, clearing debris, marking lanes - an endless cycle of fixing what nature and careless drivers relentlessly destroyed. 

This particular stretch of Highway 12, snaking its way through the desolate heart of Nevada, was particularly unforgiving. The silence here was a palpable thing, broken only by the whine of passing trucks and the distant cawing of ravens circling overhead.  It was a lonely existence, but Amy had grown accustomed to it. She found solace in the rhythm of her work, in the quiet satisfaction of knowing she played a small part in keeping the world moving forward, one pothole at a time.
