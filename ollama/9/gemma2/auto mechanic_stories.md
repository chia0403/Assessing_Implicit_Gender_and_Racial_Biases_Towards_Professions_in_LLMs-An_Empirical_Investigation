The air in Benny "Gearhead" Gallagher's garage hung thick with the scent of motor oil and burnt rubber, a familiar perfume that had become as comforting to him as his worn leather jacket. Grease stained his hands, mirroring the splatter patterns adorning the floor around his workbench. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down mercilessly on the rusty corrugated iron roof, making the entire space feel like a miniature oven.  Benny wiped the sweat from his brow, squinting at the engine block he was wrestling with. It was a 1967 Mustang, cherry red and screaming for attention, its owner – a young woman named Chloe – impatiently tapping her foot outside. Benny sighed; this wasn't just any old engine repair. This one had to be perfect. He owed it to Chloe, who had inherited the car from her grandfather, and he owed it to himself. After all, fixing this Mustang was more than just another job; it was a chance for him to reconnect with his own past, a past filled with grease stains, roaring engines, and the sweet smell of freedom.
