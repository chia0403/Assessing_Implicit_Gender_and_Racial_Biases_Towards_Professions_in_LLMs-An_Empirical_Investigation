The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia “Amy” Harper like a second skin as she wrestled her paramedic bag into the back of the ambulance. The siren wailed mournfully, echoing off the brick buildings lining Main Street in Savannah. Amy ran a hand through her sweaty hair, trying to ignore the swarm of flies buzzing around the overflowing dumpster next door. 

It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind where even the sun seemed to be wilting under the oppressive heat.  This call, though – a possible cardiac arrest at the historic River Street market – had a sense of urgency that sliced through the languid summer haze. Amy could feel the familiar rush of adrenaline as she strapped on her helmet and slid behind the wheel.

Her partner, veteran EMT Jake Miller, was already checking vitals, his calm demeanor a stark contrast to the frantic energy buzzing around them. The dispatcher's voice crackled over the radio, updating them on the patient: an elderly woman, unconscious, last seen clutching her chest.

Amy took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever they might find at the market. Savannah held its secrets close, and this call felt like it was about to unravel one.
