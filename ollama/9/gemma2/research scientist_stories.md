The air hung heavy with the scent of ozone and burnt metal, a familiar aroma in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s laboratory. She wiped stray particles of soot from her forehead, her brow furrowed in concentration as she peered through the microscope lens. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across the cluttered workbench, illuminating an array of wires, circuit boards, and disassembled robot parts – remnants of her latest experiment. 

The lab itself was a cavernous space tucked away in the bowels of the research facility, nestled deep beneath the bustling streets of Neo-Tokyo. Its walls were lined with dusty bookshelves crammed with forgotten scientific journals, their pages whispering secrets of past endeavors. A single, grimy window offered a fleeting glimpse of the neon-drenched cityscape beyond, a stark contrast to the sterile, almost monastic atmosphere within.

Eleanor wasn’t one for distractions; she thrived in this isolation, her only companions the hum of machinery and the relentless pursuit of scientific knowledge. Tonight, however, the usual hum was punctuated by an unsettling silence. Her latest creation, Project Phoenix, had gone dormant mid-experiment. She needed to understand why.
