The scent of crayons and impending meltdowns hung heavy in the air, as thick as the humid July heat that clung to Mrs. Eleanor Thistlewick's blonde curls.  Her classroom, usually a riot of color and playful chaos, was eerily quiet. Only the rhythmic whirring of the ceiling fan broke the stillness. It was the last day before summer vacation, and the five-year-olds were exhibiting their usual end-of-year blend of barely suppressed excitement and crippling boredom.  

Eleanor surveyed her domain: glitter glue smeared across a once pristine table, a half-eaten snack clutched in the plastic grip of a tiny dinosaur figurine, and a lone purple crayon lying abandoned on the rug. It was a battlefield, littered with the remnants of a year spent nurturing tiny minds and taming wild imaginations. 


But Eleanor wouldn't trade it for anything. She loved her kindergarten class at Sunnyside Elementary with all its sticky fingerprints and ear-splitting giggles. This last day felt different though, tinged with a bittersweet melancholy she couldnâ€™t quite shake off.  The end of the year always brought a wave of change, but this time felt heavier, more profound.
