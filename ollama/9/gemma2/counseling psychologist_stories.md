The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Rosalind Hawthorne's window, mimicking the relentless rhythm of her anxiety. Her small office, nestled on the third floor of an aging brick building in downtown Asheville, was usually a sanctuary, filled with the calming scents of lavender and chamomile. But today, it felt like a pressure cooker.  Eleanor stared at the notepad before her, the neat lines mockingly empty. It had been three weeks since her last client – the longest stretch she'd gone without seeing anyone in years. The sudden void felt heavier than any caseload. 

She ran a hand through her auburn hair, already starting to gray at the temples. She was supposed to be a beacon of calm, a guide through emotional turbulence, but lately, she felt adrift herself. The city outside seemed to echo her internal struggle – a symphony of honking horns and screeching brakes against the backdrop of relentless drizzle. It was as if Asheville, her beloved mountain haven, was reflecting the turmoil within. 


The chime above the door jingled, breaking Eleanor's spiraling thoughts.  A new client. Perhaps this unexpected interruption would be just what she needed to ground herself again.
