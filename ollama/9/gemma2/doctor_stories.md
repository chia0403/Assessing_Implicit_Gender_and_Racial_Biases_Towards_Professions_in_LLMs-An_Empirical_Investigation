The flickering fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly pallor over Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she hunched over the patient chart. It was 3:17 AM, the witching hour for the emergency room at Mercy General. The air hung heavy with the antiseptic scent of bleach and the faint metallic tang of blood.  Outside, a symphony of sirens wailed in the distance, a constant reminder of the city's restless pulse, always on the edge of chaos. 

Eleanor rubbed her weary eyes, their dark circles testament to countless nights spent battling both physical and emotional wounds. Her shift had been particularly brutal - a double trauma case followed by a relentless wave of flu patients. Now, she stared at the chart in front of her, feeling the familiar knot of dread tightening in her stomach.  The name scrawled across the top was one she knew all too well: Samuel Carter, a man with a history as complicated as his injuries.
