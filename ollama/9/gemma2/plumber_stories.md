The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Barnaby Bartholomew's van, each drop sounding like a miniature drum solo in the confined space.  Barnaby himself was huddled under a thin blanket, trying to nap amidst the cacophony. He was tired, bone-deep and weary from a morning spent wrestling with a particularly stubborn burst pipe in Mrs. Higgins' kitchen, followed by an afternoon of battling a clogged drain in Mr. Perkins' bathroom that turned out to be more than just hair and soap scum (a whole plastic toy pirate ship, for heaven's sake). 

He was parked on the outskirts of Ashwood, a town tucked away in the rolling hills of rural Vermont, where the only sounds besides the relentless rain were the occasional bleating of sheep from Farmer McGregor's field and the distant rumble of thunder.  Ashwood wasn't exactly bustling, but it provided Barnaby with enough plumbing emergencies to keep him busy, especially during the spring thaw when every leaky faucet seemed to have a mind of its own. 


Barnaby’s phone buzzed, pulling him from his attempted slumber. He squinted at the screen: another call. It was Mrs. Peabody from Elm Street. Her sink had stopped draining again.  

He sighed. “Maybe tomorrow,” he muttered, but his stomach rumbled in reply – a reminder that his own leaky faucet of hunger needed immediate attention. Still, duty called. A plumber's work is never done, especially in Ashwood during the spring thaw.
