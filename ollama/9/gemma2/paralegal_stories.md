The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Amelia "Amy" Harper's cubicle. Papers overflowed from her filing cabinet, their edges curling like dying leaves. The air smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation – a familiar aroma in the small law firm nestled on a gritty street corner in downtown Chicago.  

It was 6:45 PM, Friday night, and Amy was supposed to be out enjoying the last warm days of summer. Instead, she was hunched over a stack of case files for Mr. Thornton's lawsuit against the city, her mind already churning with weekend anxieties – unpaid bills, a leaking faucet, and a cat named Schrödinger who seemed particularly grumpy this week.

A sharp rapping on her cubicle wall startled Amy from her reverie. 

"Harper?" A gruff voice boomed through the flimsy partition. "Get down to Thornton's office. Now!"


The setting: A small, understaffed law firm in downtown Chicago, struggling to stay afloat amidst a wave of high-profile cases and relentless bureaucracy. The atmosphere is one of chaos and exhaustion, fueled by cheap coffee and the constant pressure of meeting deadlines.
