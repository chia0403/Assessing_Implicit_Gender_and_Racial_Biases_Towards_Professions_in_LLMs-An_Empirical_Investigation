The low hum of conversation, punctuated by clinking glasses and the rhythmic whir of the ice crusher, filled The Gilded Cage like a contented purr. Amelia "Amy" Beaumont meticulously polished a martini glass, her reflection shimmering back at her from its cool surface.  A smear of lipstick – crimson like a spilled ruby – marked the edge of the counter, a silent testament to last night's revelry. Amy, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight braid and emerald eyes that seemed to see right through you, surveyed the dimly lit bar. It was Tuesday night, which meant an eclectic mix: bored businessmen nursing scotch, college students sharing cheap beer, and the occasional lone soul seeking solace in a stiff drink.  The air, thick with cigarette smoke and the lingering scent of jasmine perfume, crackled with anticipation. Amy leaned against the bar, her gaze fixed on the door. Tonight felt different. A storm was brewing, both outside and within the walls of The Gilded Cage. 


**Setting:**  The Gilded Cage - a dimly lit, smoky jazz bar nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter.
