The aroma of turmeric, ginger, and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender from the diffuser in the corner.  Sunlight streamed through the large south-facing windows of Amelia Harper's Holistic Wellness Studio, illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden light. Outside, the bustling city of Toronto hummed with its usual symphony of car horns and construction noise, but within these walls, a sense of calm prevailed. Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, surveyed her space – rows of brightly colored yoga mats lined the far wall, while shelves overflowed with jars of organic herbs, essential oils, and cookbooks promising healthy and delicious meals. 

Her gaze fell upon a man slumped in one of the plush armchairs, his shoulders hunched, brow furrowed. This was Simon Miller, a high-powered lawyer known for his ruthless drive and even more demanding schedule. He'd booked Amelia for a consultation after landing himself in hospital with exhaustion and a severe case of indigestion – symptoms he blamed on "too much work" and "not enough sleep." 


Amelia approached him with a warm smile. "Simon, good to see you. Please don't worry, we'll get you feeling better."  

She knew Simon was skeptical about alternative medicine. Could she convince him that his physical ailments weren't just stress-induced but stemmed from years of neglecting his basic nutritional needs?
