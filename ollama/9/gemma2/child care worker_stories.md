The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Peterson's head, casting a sterile glow on the plastic alphabet blocks scattered across the floor. Around her, six children - a whirlwind of sticky fingers, boundless energy, and unbridled imaginations - were engaged in their own chaotic symphony of play. Amelia smiled, the familiar warmth spreading through her chest despite the lingering scent of crayons and spilled juice that permeated the air. This was "Sunshine Daycare," her haven amidst the bustling chaos of suburban life, a place where tiny humans thrived under her watchful eye. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease, like static electricity buzzing under Amelia's skin, lingered in the back of her mind. Perhaps it was the way little Ethan kept clutching his teddy bear, whispering frantic words to himself. Or maybe it was the unnerving silence that had fallen over usually boisterous Lily, who sat alone, staring at the wall with vacant eyes. Whatever it was, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
