Amy’s job was to clear land for a new residential development, a concrete testament to humanity’s relentless march towards progress. 


But today felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, thick and unsettling like the dust motes dancing in the sunlight. It wasn't just the heat, nor the ever-present buzz of construction. Something else was off, a prickling at the back of Amy's neck that whispered of danger lurking beneath the sunbaked surface.
