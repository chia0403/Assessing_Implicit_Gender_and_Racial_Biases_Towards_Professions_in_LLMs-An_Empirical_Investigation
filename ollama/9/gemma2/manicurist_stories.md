The midday sun slanted through the dusty window, casting stripes of light across the worn linoleum floor of "Nails by Nadia."  Nadia Petrova hummed along to the jaunty pop music on the radio, her focus entirely absorbed in shaping the perfect almond nail for Mrs. Henderson, a regular client with impeccable taste and an equally impeccable disdain for anything less than flawless. 

Nadia's tiny shop, tucked away on a side street in the heart of Baltimore's Little Italy, was a haven of vibrant colors and calming scents. Rows of shimmering polishes lined the walls, their names – "Ruby Sunset," "Midnight Sapphire," "Mermaid Tears" – whispering promises of transformation. A gentle lavender mist hung in the air, a soothing counterpoint to the insistent hum of the electric file against Mrs. Henderson's nail.  

But beneath the cheerful surface, Nadia felt a prickle of unease. It had started with a dream – vivid, unsettling, and impossible to shake off. Now, even the familiar rhythm of filing and polishing couldn't quite drown out a sense of foreboding that settled in her chest like a stone.  It was just a bad dream, she told herself, trying to focus on the delicate task at hand.
