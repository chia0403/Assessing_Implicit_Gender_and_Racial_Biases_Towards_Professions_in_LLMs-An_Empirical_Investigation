The humid Louisiana air clung to Eliza Beatrice Beaumont like a second skin as she unlocked her classroom door.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stale air. The familiar scent of chalk and old textbooks mingled with the faint aroma of magnolia blossoms from the giant tree outside. 

Eliza sighed, adjusting the strap of her worn canvas bag. Summer break had been a welcome respite, but now the thought of facing another year of teenage angst and standardized testing filled her with a mixture of trepidation and weary enthusiasm. She straightened the stack of ungraded essays on her desk, each one a testament to the creative chaos that was high school English. Today, she'd be introducing the class to Shakespeare's *Hamlet*, hoping to spark some passion for the Bard amidst the collective yawns.  


Eliza took a deep breath, steeling herself for the onslaught of teenage indifference and the occasional rogue paper airplane. It wouldnâ€™t be easy, but this was her classroom, and she was determined to make it a haven for words and ideas, even if it meant battling distractions like buzzing flies and slumbering students one sonnet at a time.
