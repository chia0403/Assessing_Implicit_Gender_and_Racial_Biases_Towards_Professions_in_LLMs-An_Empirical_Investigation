The flickering neon sign outside "Buzzworthy Branding" cast an unsettling glow across Elara Beatrice Finch's tired face. She rubbed her eyes, trying to fight off the remnants of a restless night fuelled by instant ramen and anxieties about the upcoming pitch. 

Inside, the office was still shrouded in the pre-dawn darkness. The only sound besides the hum of the fluorescent lights was the rhythmic click-clacking of Elara's keyboard as she frantically tweaked the design for "NutriNoms," a new line of protein bars targeted at millennial gym rats.  She squinted at the screen, her brow furrowed in concentration. 

The city outside was still slumbering, its skyline a jagged silhouette against the bruised purple sky. A lone taxi sped by, its yellow form a fleeting beacon in the otherwise dark urban canvas. In this quiet pre-dawn hour, Elara felt a familiar pang of loneliness. The weight of responsibility for the agency's success, coupled with the constant pressure to be creative, often left her feeling isolated, like a single spark flickering in an endless expanse of darkness.
