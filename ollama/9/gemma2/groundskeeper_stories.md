The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick’s wool coat like a damp memory, swirling around his ankles as he trudged across the dew-laden lawns of Ashwood Manor.  Bartholomew, known affectionately by the staff as “Thistle” for his prickly demeanor and equally prickly personality, was not a man who relished mornings. He preferred the afternoon sun, when shadows stretched long and his work felt less like drudgery and more like sculpting. 

Ashwood Manor wasn't just any manor; it was steeped in centuries of history, its sprawling gardens a testament to generations past. Twisted oaks whispered secrets carried on the wind, their branches entwined like lovers caught in an eternal embrace. Ancient box hedges formed geometric patterns that echoed the grandeur of the manor itself, and vibrant roses bloomed in unruly profusion, their sweet fragrance competing with the earthy scent of freshly tilled soil. 

Thistle gripped his trowel tighter, feeling a familiar pang of discontent as he surveyed the scene. The manicured lawns were marred by patches of unmowed grass, and a rogue squirrel had decided to make a nest in the prized rosebushes. It was a constant battle, this war against nature's whims. Yet, despite his grumbling, Thistle felt a strange sense of belonging here. Ashwood Manor was his domain, its secrets as familiar as his own reflection. He knew every twist and turn of the paths, every hidden nook and cranny of the gardens. And he suspected that somewhere within this labyrinth of green, there were stories waiting to be unearthed, just like the forgotten treasures buried beneath the soil.
