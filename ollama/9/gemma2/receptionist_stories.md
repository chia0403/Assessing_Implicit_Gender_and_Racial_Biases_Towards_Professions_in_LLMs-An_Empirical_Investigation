The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Periwinkle, their pale glow illuminating dust motes dancing in the stagnant air. She tapped her acrylic nails against the chipped laminate countertop, a rhythm as familiar to her as her own heartbeat. The waiting room of Dr. Caldwell's Neurology Practice was eerily quiet, a stark contrast to the cacophony of coughs and sniffles that usually filled this space by mid-morning. 

Amelia glanced at the clock for the tenth time in the past five minutes. 9:52 am.  Where was everyone? Was there a local flu outbreak she hadn't heard about? Or had Dr. Caldwell, notorious for his last-minute cancellations and unpredictable schedule, decided to take a spontaneous day off again? 

Whatever the reason, Amelia felt a familiar twinge of boredom settling in her stomach. She craved something more than the mundane routine of answering phones, filing paperwork, and occasionally dispensing lukewarm cups of instant coffee. Perhaps today would be different. Perhaps today, something interesting would happen.
