Rain lashed against the window of Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s cramped office, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the warped glass. The wind howled like a banshee outside, rattling the ancient building that housed the "Sunstone Chronicle," a small-town newspaper clinging to relevance in a digital age.  

Amelia, her name emblazoned on a faded brass nameplate above a dusty desk piled high with crumpled papers and half-empty coffee cups, stared out at the storm. It mirrored the tempest brewing within her. A month ago, she'd been assigned the "fluffy" beat – local bake sales and school talent shows. Now, she was facing down an investigation that could rock their sleepy town of Oakhaven to its core. 


The source? A trembling woman with haunted eyes, claiming to have seen something unspeakable in the woods beyond the abandoned Thorne Manor.  A place whispered about in hushed tones, said to be cursed and riddled with shadows. Amelia, a journalist who'd always believed in facts over folklore, scoffed at first. But then came the missing posters, the frantic whispers, the undeniable fear that clung to Oakhaven like the fog rolling in from the sea.  
 
Now, Amelia had a choice: bury her head in the sand, or face the storm and unravel the truth, no matter how terrifying it might be. And she knew, with a certainty that settled deep in her bones, that she wouldn't turn away. Oakhaven deserved better than whispers and shadows. It deserved Amelia Rose Hawthorne.
