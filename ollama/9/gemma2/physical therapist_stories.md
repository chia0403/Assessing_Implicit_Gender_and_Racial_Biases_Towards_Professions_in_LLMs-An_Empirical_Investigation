The scent of antiseptic and warm linoleum clung to Amelia Harper like a second skin. It was a familiar smell, comforting in its predictability. For five years, this small, sun-drenched therapy room had been her sanctuary, a place where she helped people reclaim their mobility, their independence. 

Amelia glanced at the clock – 9:15 am. Her first patient of the day, Mr. Thomas Miller, was due any minute. He’d come in with a mangled ankle from a fall on the icy steps of his porch. Amelia had already reviewed his X-rays and compiled a treatment plan, but she always took a moment to listen to her patients before she began. 

Outside, the crisp autumn air rustled through the leaves of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel outside her window. The branches, now bare, cast intricate shadows across the worn wooden floor, a stark reminder of the fleeting nature of time. Just like her patients, Amelia knew life could change in an instant, leaving you vulnerable and unsure of your next step. 


But here, in this small room filled with the promise of healing, she found purpose.
