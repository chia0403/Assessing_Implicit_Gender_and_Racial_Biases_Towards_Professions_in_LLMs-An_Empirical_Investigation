The humid Georgia air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain as Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont weaved her way through the crowded Saturday morning farmer's market. A kaleidoscope of vibrant colors assaulted her senses: crimson strawberries glistening in their baskets, emerald green zucchini piled high, sunflowers taller than a child reaching for the sun.  But Ellie wasn't there to admire the local bounty. 

She was here on a mission. To sell. Her worn leather portfolio bag, laden with brochures and samples, felt like a weight against her hip as she navigated the bustling stalls. A practiced smile plastered across her face, Ellie approached a stall overflowing with plump pumpkins, ready to launch into her pitch about the benefits of the new, eco-friendly fertilizer she represented.  

Ellie had always been good at sales. Her charm, wit, and uncanny ability to connect with people were her weapons of choice in the cutthroat world of agricultural marketing. But today felt different. A sense of unease, like a storm brewing on the horizon, shadowed her usual confidence.  Perhaps it was the unsettling stillness in the air, or maybe it was the way the sunlight seemed to cast everything in an eerie, golden glow. Whatever the reason, Ellie couldn't shake the feeling that something big, and perhaps unwelcome, was about to change.
