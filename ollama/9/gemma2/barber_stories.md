The scent of Bay Rum hung thick in the air, clinging to Bartholomew “Bart” Finch’s apron like a well-loved shroud. He stood hunched over his chair, clippers buzzing rhythmically against the scalp of Mr. Henderson, a gruff old fisherman with a face weathered like driftwood. Outside, the sun beat down on the sleepy seaside town of Havenport, casting long shadows from the pastel houses lining Mermaid Street. 

Bart’s barbershop, tucked away at the end of the street, was a sanctuary of sorts – a haven from the salty air and the incessant cries of gulls. It held within its worn wooden walls a tapestry woven with stories whispered over steaming mugs of coffee and the rhythmic snip-snip-snip of Bart’s clippers. 


He had been tending to Havenport's hair for twenty years, long enough to know the ebb and flow of every life that passed through his door. But lately, a stillness had settled over the town, a quiet hum beneath the usual symphony of seagulls and fishermen’s shanties. Bart couldn’t put his finger on it, but something felt...different.
