The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the deserted hallways of the National Museum of Natural History after closing time. Edgar Bartholomew Tremont, better known simply as "Ed," maneuvered his mop across the polished tile floor, its rhythmic swish echoing through the cavernous space. He paused before the mammoth skeleton, its colossal ribs stretching towards the high ceiling like petrified fingers reaching for a forgotten sky. Ed ran a hand over the smooth, cold bone, imagining the creature's immense power, its thundering gait across frozen plains millennia ago. A shiver ran down his spine, not from the chill of the night, but from the weight of history pressed against him.

The museum held a million stories, whispered by the rustling leaves in the dioramas, etched into the worn pages of ancient books, and preserved within the amber tombs of extinct creatures. Ed, with his worn-out sneakers and faded uniform, might have seemed an unlikely custodian of these secrets, but he knew them all intimately. He knew the precise angle of sunlight that illuminated the Hope Diamond's deep blue fire, the scent of formaldehyde that lingered in the paleontology wing, and the exact location of every loose floorboard that creaked underfoot. 


He was more than just a janitor; he was a silent guardian of these relics, the keeper of their stories, waiting for the dawn to bring new visitors, eager to discover the wonders hidden within the museum's walls.
