The bell above the door chimed its usual discordant jingle as Amelia Beatrice Periwinkle surveyed the sparse afternoon crowd.  It was always quiet at "Apothecary on Alder," especially after the lunch rush faded and before the evening shift began. The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a soothing blend Amelia concocted herself to combat the lingering dustiness of the century-old building.

The shop itself was a charming labyrinth of cluttered shelves, each groaning under the weight of dusty bottles filled with curious elixirs and tinctures. Amelia's grandfather, a renowned herbalist in his time, had filled every nook and cranny with his legacy - handwritten journals detailing arcane remedies, faded photographs of smiling patients clutching his concoctions, and even a taxidermied badger perched atop the cash register, forever guarding a jar of "Badger Bile Tonic for Stubborn Colds." 

Amelia ran a hand over the smooth surface of a mortar and pestle, its wooden handle worn smooth by countless hours of grinding herbs.  She sighed, watching as a lone sunbeam illuminated a swirling cloud of dust motes dancing in the afternoon light. Another slow day at the Apothecary. Maybe tomorrow would be different.
