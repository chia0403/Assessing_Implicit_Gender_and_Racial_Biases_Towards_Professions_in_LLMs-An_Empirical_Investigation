Rain hammered against the windows of Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's cubicle, mimicking the staccato rhythm of her keyboard clicks. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the rows of desks in the sprawling open-plan office of GlobalTech Solutions. Outside, Chicago roared with the fury of a thunderstorm, but inside, Ellie was lost in the quiet hum of code and the blinking cursor on her monitor. 

She was knee-deep in debugging the company's new customer relationship management system, a behemoth of interconnected databases and algorithms dubbed "Phoenix." Phoenix was supposed to revolutionize GlobalTech's interactions with its clients, streamlining communication and personalizing services. So far, it was doing more revolutionizing than Ellie had bargained for, wreaking havoc on their entire network like a digital wildfire.  

Ellie squinted at the screen, her brow furrowed in concentration. A cascade of error messages scrolled past, a cryptic language she desperately needed to decipher before Phoenix brought down the entire company. The deadline was looming, and with it, the ever-present pressure from her superiors. 


"If this goes south, Vance," Mr. Henderson had warned, his voice like gravel on asphalt, "you'll be cleaning out your desk faster than you can say 'bug.'"
