The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Harper's head like a swarm of anxious bees, casting a sterile glow over the clutter of her office.  Posters promoting college prep and self-esteem hung precariously from mismatched walls, their cheery slogans battling with the musty smell of old textbooks and unfulfilled dreams. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sprawling high school campus, where teenagers moved like restless phantoms, oblivious to the weight Amelia carried in her heart.  Every day she navigated the labyrinthine hallways, a silent shepherd guiding lost souls through the treacherous terrain of adolescence. Each whispered worry, every tearful confession, chipped away at her own resilience, leaving behind a weary ache that only coffee and late-night reruns could temporarily soothe.

A new student, arriving mid-year, with a last name whispered to be "shadowed by tragedy." Amelia sighed, bracing herself for another emotional storm. Some days, guiding these young hearts felt less like counseling and more like holding back a tsunami.
