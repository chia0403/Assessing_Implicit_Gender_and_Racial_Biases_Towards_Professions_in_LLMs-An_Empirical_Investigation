The air in Amelia Brighton’s office smelled faintly of jasmine and despair. It wasn't a pleasant combination.  She stared at the screen, her reflection distorted by the glow emanating from the laptop. Her inbox overflowed with cancelled trips, postponed honeymoons, and panicked inquiries about refunds. The vibrant brochures on her wall, once boasting sun-kissed beaches and snow-capped mountains, now mocked her with their unattainable promises.

Amelia Brighton, "Travel Guru" as she'd proudly dubbed herself on her website, felt anything but.  The world had ground to a halt, leaving her stranded in a sea of unfulfilled dreams and mounting bills. Her once bustling office, located in the heart of New York City’s vibrant tourist district, was now eerily quiet, save for the gentle hum of the AC unit struggling against the summer heat. 


Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  She glanced at the photo on her desk - a picture of herself grinning broadly in front of the Taj Mahal, taken just before the world went sideways.  A pang of longing shot through her. She missed the thrill of sending people off on adventures, watching their eyes light up with anticipation, listening to their stories upon their return. 

But for now, all she had were emails and a dwindling hope that someday soon, the world would start spinning again.
