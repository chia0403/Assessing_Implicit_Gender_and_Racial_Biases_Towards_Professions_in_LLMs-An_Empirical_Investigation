The aroma of burnt coffee hung heavy in Dr. Amelia Celeste’s office, a testament to her late start and preoccupation with the patient file on her desk. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her second-floor space, mirroring the tempest brewing within her own mind.  

Amelia stared at the name emblazoned across the file: “Victor Thorne.” The mere whisper of it sent a shiver down her spine. She had heard whispers in the halls about him – a recluse, a tortured soul, haunted by a past he refused to share. Now, he sat across from her, shrouded in shadows and an aura of unnerving stillness.

Her office, usually bathed in soft sunlight thanks to its west-facing windows, felt suffocatingly dark this afternoon. A worn armchair faced her desk, draped in faded floral fabric – the remnants of a cheerful past that now seemed a distant memory. Bookshelves lined the walls, overflowing with tomes on psychology, neurology, and mythology, each offering a potential key to unlocking Victor's enigmatic silence. 

Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the journey ahead. This wasn't just another session; it was an invitation into the labyrinth of the human psyche, a place where shadows danced with secrets and truth lay hidden beneath layers of pain.
