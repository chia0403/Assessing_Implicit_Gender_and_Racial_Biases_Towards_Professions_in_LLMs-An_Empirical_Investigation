The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sterile glow over the pristine white surfaces of her dental practice. Outside, Seattle thrummed with its usual frenetic energy, but inside "Finch Family Dentistry," time seemed to move at a slower, more measured pace. The air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and faintly, a hint of peppermint from the sugar-free gum Amelia kept in a bowl for her anxious patients.

Amelia leaned back against her mahogany desk, the polished wood warm beneath her fingertips. She sipped her lukewarm tea, its floral aroma barely registering amidst the omnipresent tang of dental tools. Her gaze drifted towards the framed photo on her desk â€“ a younger Amelia, beaming alongside her parents and two mischievous siblings, all posed in front of their childhood home in Vermont. A bittersweet ache settled in her chest.  She'd left that world behind years ago, drawn to the bustling city life Seattle offered. 


Amelia adjusted her glasses, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its confines. It was a Tuesday morning, and already appointments were stacking up on her schedule. Just another day in the life of Dr. Amelia Beatrice Finch. But something felt different today. A prickle of anticipation danced on her skin, an almost imperceptible shift in the atmosphere. Perhaps it was just the Seattle drizzle seeping into her bones, or maybe, just maybe, it was something more.
