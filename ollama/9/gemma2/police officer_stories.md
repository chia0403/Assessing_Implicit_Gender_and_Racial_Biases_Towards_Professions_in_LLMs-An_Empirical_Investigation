The flickering neon sign outside “Jimmy’s Diner” cast a sickly green glow over Detective Alistair Finch's rain-slicked trench coat. He hunched deeper into his collar, the wind whipping icy droplets against his face. A steady drizzle had turned the normally bustling city street into a shimmering maze of puddles and blurred headlights.  

Finch was all too familiar with this kind of night in New Albion City - the damp chill that seeped into your bones, the hollow echoes bouncing off empty storefronts, and the gnawing feeling that something dark lurked just beneath the surface. He pushed open the diner's door, a blast of warm air and sizzling bacon hitting him like a wall. 


A tired-looking waitress with red hair pulled back in a tight bun looked up from wiping down a counter. “Coffee?” she asked without asking, her voice thick with exhaustion.

Finch nodded, sinking into a booth near the window. He watched the rain lash against the glass, his mind already churning over the case that had brought him here: the disappearance of Professor Evelyn Thorne, a renowned historian who vanished without a trace from her locked office at the city museum just hours ago.
