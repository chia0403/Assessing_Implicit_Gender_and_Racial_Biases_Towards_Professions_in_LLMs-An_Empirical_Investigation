The aroma of roasting almonds hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of lemon zest from the breakfast muffins just out of the oven. Eleanor Amelia Butterfield adjusted her apron – a splash of vibrant sunflower yellow against the crisp white walls of "Nourish & Bloom," her cozy wellness clinic nestled in the heart of Asheville's eclectic downtown. 

Sunlight streamed through the large windows, bathing the space in a warm glow. Fresh flowers burst from rustic vases on every table, and soft, instrumental music played softly in the background.  Eleanor took a deep breath, savoring the calm before the storm. This Saturday morning was always her busiest, filled with clients eager to kickstart their health journeys. 

But today felt different. A sense of anticipation, tinged with a flicker of apprehension, buzzed beneath Eleanor's skin. Today wasn't just about helping another client shed a few pounds or manage their diabetes; today, she was facing her own demons –  a challenge that threatened to upend everything she held dear.
