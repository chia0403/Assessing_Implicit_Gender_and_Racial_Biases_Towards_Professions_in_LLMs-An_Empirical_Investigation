The whine of static filled Amelia "Amy" Thorne's ears as she tightened the last nut on the vintage Marconi receiver.  Its brass casing glinted under the single bare bulb hanging from the ceiling of her cramped workshop, a space squeezed between a laundromat and a pawn shop in the bustling heart of New Orleans.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, drumming out a frantic rhythm that mirrored Amy's own nervous energy. 

She wasn't supposed to be tinkering with this antique, not tonight. The old woman had been clear: "Only use it when you hear the whisper." But the air crackled with an unseen electricity, and a message, faint as a dying ember, pulsed through the receiver's speaker. Amy couldn't ignore it, wouldn't ignore it.  This was more than just another repair job; this was a chance to prove herself, to show her father she wasn't just "a tinkerer."


The old woman had called herself Madame Evangeline. She claimed the Marconi could pierce the veil between worlds, that its whispers held secrets both beautiful and terrifying. Amy, ever the pragmatist, dismissed it as eccentricity until tonight.  Tonight, something was different. Tonight, the whisper spoke to her soul.
