The humid Georgia air clung to Daniel Jeremiah "Danny" Blackwood like a wet blanket as he wrestled a length of thick cable through the doorway of Mrs. Henderson's porch. Danny, with his grease-stained overalls and unruly auburn hair escaping from under his hard hat, was a far cry from the genteel atmosphere that usually permeated this quiet cul-de-sac in Savannah's historic district.  

Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose age seemed to defy the wrinkles etched around her eyes, peered out at him with a mixture of apprehension and relief. Her porch, usually adorned with blooming jasmine and hummingbirds, was shrouded in an unsettling silence. The source? A dead light fixture that had cast a pall over her entire world – literally. 


Danny grinned, wiping his brow with the back of his hand. "Don't you worry, Mrs. Henderson. We'll have your lights back on brighter than ever before." He winked, then surveyed the porch, his electrician's eyes scanning for the culprit behind the blackout. This wasn't just any faulty wire – this was a mystery waiting to be solved.
