The morning sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Finnegan's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes as he wrestled another steel beam into place atop the skeletal frame of the skyscraper. The city of New Zenith sprawled around him, a dizzying tapestry of glass and chrome reflecting the blinding light.  

Bart squinted, trying to find some solace in the familiar chaos of construction. Cranes danced like mechanical giraffes against the azure sky, their long arms wielding steel and concrete with robotic precision. Below, a symphony of clanging metal, whirring engines, and shouted instructions filled the air. The rhythmic clang was the city's heartbeat, the pulse of progress, and Bart was its muscle. 

Today, though, something felt different. A knot of unease tightened in his gut, making him question the rhythm he knew so well. Maybe it was the way the wind seemed to whisper secrets through the unfinished steel ribs of the building, or the unsettling stillness that descended upon the construction site for a fleeting moment before the din resumed. Whatever it was, Bart couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change, something big.  


He wiped his brow again, ignoring the prickle of goosebumps on his arms. Time to get back to work. The steel wouldnâ€™t weld itself.
