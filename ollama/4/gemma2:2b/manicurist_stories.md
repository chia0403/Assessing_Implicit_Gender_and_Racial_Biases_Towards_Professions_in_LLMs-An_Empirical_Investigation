The humid air hung thick in the tiny salon nestled between a curry house and a pet grooming parlor, clinging to Eloise "Ellie" Fontaine's already sweat-slicked hands as she scrubbed a stubborn stain off a vintage ruby nail polish bottle.  It was always like this - a symphony of simmering spices, buzzing fluorescent lights, and hushed whispers of gossip from the other stylists. Ellie loved the chaos, even though it meant her usual calm demeanor could be easily disturbed. She wasn't just a manicurist; she was an artist, creating masterpieces out of chipped acrylic and the occasional stray fingerprint. 

Ellie surveyed her workstation, her eyes sweeping over the array of tools: tiny metal files, shimmering emery boards, glass jars filled with swirling polishes - each one telling a silent story of its own. Tonight, though, something felt different. An undercurrent of unease thrummed beneath the usual buzz, making Ellie's hands feel heavy and her thoughts unfocused. 

Outside, the city hummed with an energy that was almost tangible; a mixture of exhaust fumes, sirens, and laughter spilling out from nearby bars. Tonight was Friday night, and in this corner of the city, life pulsed with the rhythm of late-night revelry.  But Ellie felt detached, her focus on the swirling crimson polish and its mysterious stain while oblivious to the world around her.
