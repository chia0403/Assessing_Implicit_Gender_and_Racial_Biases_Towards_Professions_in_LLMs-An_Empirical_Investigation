The morning mist clung to Willow Creek like a sleepy child's breath, refusing to give way to the relentless sun that would soon burn it away.  Willow herself, as she surveyed her charges from her perch atop the oak, sighed. The usual symphony of chirps and snuffles had been replaced by an unnerving quiet, a void that stretched even further than the miles between the sprawling animal sanctuary and the bustling city beyond. 

Her name was Willow Brook, and for eighteen years, she'd dedicated herself to the welfare of these creatures who couldn't speak for themselves.  Here, among the rolling hills, verdant meadows and tangled woods of Willow Creek Sanctuary, she found solace in a life spent nurturing not just beasts but also her own heart. The sanctuary was a place where forgotten souls came to find peace, a haven for all manner of animals – from the majestic stallions who grazed peacefully by the forest’s edge to the mischievous squirrel that had taken up residence in her workshop. 

But today, a shadow clung to Willow's usually optimistic spirit.  Her heart pounded like a trapped bird as she saw movement in the dense undergrowth near the sanctuary's boundary – something large and unfamiliar. The air itself seemed charged with anticipation, every rustle of leaves in the breeze carrying an ominous message.
