## The Clocktower's Bite

The air in the Clocktower Hotel was thick with a peculiar blend of lavender perfume, dust motes dancing in the fading afternoon sunlight, and a hint of something slightly metallic.  Evelyn Bellweather, perched precariously on the edge of her worn-leather stool, surveyed the chaos unfolding around her like an overworked conductor watching his orchestra descend into disarray. The reception desk, normally adorned with a cheerful floral arrangement, now bore the brunt of a three-legged cat's artistic rampage - floral petals were splayed across a freshly-delivered stack of brochures, and a misplaced teapot dripped viscous brown liquid onto the glossy surface of her pristine nameplate.

Evelyn sighed, pushing back a unruly strand of auburn hair that seemed to defy gravity's grasp. Her day hadn’t started well; Mrs. Higgins, notorious for her dramatic complaints and uncanny ability to summon ghostly whispers when she was dissatisfied with the hotel's air conditioning, had been particularly vocal about wanting a room overlooking "the whispering trees." The clock tower, a constant, silent observer in the corner of the lobby, chimed midnight, its mournful tone echoing through Evelyn’s tired bones. 

Evelyn knew this was just another day. Another symphony of demands, misplaced expectations, and the ever-present pressure to keep the Clocktower running like a well-oiled machine.  But as she watched the clock tower's face slowly turn from midnight to one in the morning, a strange thought crept into her mind: maybe there were whispers about these trees too.
