## Setting: 

The air hung thick with the smell of freshly cut grass and pine needles, even as a light drizzle began to fall on the manicured lawns of Elmwood Estate. The sprawling grounds were a symphony of greens and blues under the watchful eye of the late afternoon sun. But for Theodore "Theo" Blackwood, the only colors he saw were the muted grays and browns of a wilting hydrangea and the worn edges of his well-loved canvas bag.

## Story Opening: 

The last call came at three o'clock sharp – a customary ritual Theo found both comforting and unsettling. He had grown accustomed to the routine, yet never quite warmed up to it. The rhythmic click of his lawn mower was almost a lullaby after years spent tending to Elmwood Estate's verdant landscape. Today, however, something felt different. A heavy silence hung in the air, punctuated only by the steady hum of Theo’s machine and the occasional flash of a nearby bird's wing. 

Theo paused his work at the rose garden, glancing up towards the looming silhouette of Elmwood Manor. The mansion was shrouded in an eerie stillness, its windows dark as if holding their breath. Even the usually boisterous chatter of squirrels seemed subdued, almost afraid.  A shiver ran down Theo’s spine; something wasn't quite right in this symphony of nature.
