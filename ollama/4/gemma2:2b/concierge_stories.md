The crispness of late fall air bit at Isabelle Beaumont's cheeks as she navigated the ornate foyer of Maison du Ciel.  Her breath caught in her throat; even after years spent navigating the luxurious currents of Parisian life, this place always sent a shiver of awe down her spine.   She adjusted the worn leather strap of her satchel, its contents – keys, bills, and a crumpled piece of paper with a handwritten address - rattling softly against its weight.  

A hush fell over the grand marble staircase as Isabelle entered the living quarters of her newest charge, a wealthy art collector known only as Monsieur Dubois. The opulent atmosphere was in stark contrast to the bustling streets clamoring for attention just outside the wrought-iron doors. 
The scent of old books and woodsmoke hung in the air, swirling with hints of cinnamon and something uniquely aged that Isabelle found both comforting and intoxicating.  A single ray of late afternoon sun slanted through a vast skylight, illuminating dust motes dancing across the polished floors.

This was her life - keeping order in a world overflowing with chaos and secrets. It wasn't always glamorous, but it gave her an unparalleled view of the lives she served. Tonight, though, even as Isabelle expertly sorted through the day’s deliveries and whispered instructions to the housekeeper, she couldn't shake off the strange unease that had been settling in her heart like a fog rolling over the city lights.
