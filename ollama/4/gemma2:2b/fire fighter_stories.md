The amber glow from the fire hydrants painted long shadows across Station 12's asphalt parking lot.  Rain lashed against the roof of the station building, each drop a tiny percussion in the symphony of the storm. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of burnt coffee and damp leather jackets. Captain Michael Callahan, his name a guttural echo in the sudden silence after the klaxonâ€™s final wail, pulled off his helmet, letting his weary face be swallowed by the shadows. He was staring at the flickering blue screen of his phone, a tired sigh escaping his lips. 

"No signal," he muttered, shoving his hand deeper into his thick coat pocket to adjust his earpiece again. "Not even a whimper." His voice echoed hollowly in the otherwise empty station, the only sound besides the insistent drumbeat of rain and the relentless hum of emergency lights outside. He knew this wouldn't be easy - another storm, another night, another fight against the elements and the encroaching darkness. But tonight, something felt...different. Tonight, it was as if a shadow had been cast over the city's usual fire-breathing chaos.
