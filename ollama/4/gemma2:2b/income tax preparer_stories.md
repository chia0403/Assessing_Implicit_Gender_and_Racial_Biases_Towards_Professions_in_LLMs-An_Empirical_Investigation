## Opening & Setting

**Name:**  Elara "Ellie" Reyes 

**Setting:** Ellie's office was nestled amongst the chaos of downtown Seattle, tucked away on a side street behind a bustling coffee shop and a vintage bookstore. The air hung heavy with anticipation and the scent of cinnamon-infused coffee as customers filed in, some nervous butterflies fluttering around their tax forms like captive fireflies. 

**Opening:** Ellie tapped her pencil impatiently against the worn surface of her desk. January had always been her busiest month –  a whirlwind of spreadsheets, brackets, and the ever-present rumble of anxious whispers from worried faces. This year, though, was different. The scent of cinnamon seemed to twist into something more sinister this evening, almost a cloying undercurrent that sent chills down Ellie's spine. 

The last client was just leaving when the call rang, its insistent tone jarring through the quiet hum of her office. She grimaced as she picked it up, a wave of nausea washing over her. It wasn’t just any call – it was from the police, demanding she come down immediately.  Ellie felt a knot forming in her stomach; this wasn't part of the usual December chaos, and something about this case felt… personal.
