## The Setting:

The air in "Scissors & Secrets" was thick with the scent of citrus shampoo and nervous anticipation. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing across a worn wooden countertop where Bartholomew 'Bart' Evermore meticulously trimmed the fringe of a client's unruly curls.  The shop itself held its secrets close, a cozy haven tucked away in the heart of Portland's historic district. 

## The Story Opening:

"He doesn't trust anyone else with his hair," whispered Elara, her voice barely above a murmur as she leaned against the doorway, watching Bart work with the detached grace only someone who knew every curl and bend of a person’s face could possess. "He says you have an…artistic eye." 

Bart stopped cutting, the scissors hanging in mid-air like startled sparrows. He turned, his hazel eyes meeting Elara's for the first time. The world seemed to dim, his usual focus shifting as he took her in - her dark dress cascading around her slender legs, the way she held herself with quiet confidence. 

"Elara," Bart said, his voice husky with something that felt like both curiosity and a hint of fear. "You should be careful what you wish for."
