The mist clung to the towering pines like a shroud, obscuring the familiar beauty of the forest with each breath of wind that whistled through the boughs. Silas Blackwood, his weathered face creased with years spent battling the elements and the stubborn heart of the trees, tightened his grip on the worn leather of his chainsaw, its familiar weight grounding him in the unforgiving silence of the morning. He’d been logging these woods for almost twenty years now, a lifetime felt more like an eternity by the relentless pace of the seasons.  His boots crunched over the damp earth as he navigated the uneven path, each step measured and deliberate amidst the eerie stillness of this ancient land.  

The air reeked of pine needles and damp earth, but a faint chill clung to it, hinting at the impending snowfall that was already painting the sky with an ominous gray. As Silas started toward his logging site, he saw it - a small, almost imperceptible tremor in the ground. It was as if the forest itself had taken a breath, shifting ever so slightly. 

**Setting:**  The story takes place in a remote part of the Pacific Northwest, where towering evergreen forests meet rugged mountain ranges. The area is known for its dense woodland and challenging logging conditions, with the occasional glimpse of rushing waterfalls and misty canyons hidden within the verdant canopy.


 **Main Character:** Silas Blackwood. A seasoned logger haunted by an unsolved mystery from his past, he’s stoic and reserved, but deeply protective of the land he calls home.
