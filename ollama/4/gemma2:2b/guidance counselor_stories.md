## Setting: 

The air in Sunnyview High hangs thick with teenage angst and the lingering scent of chlorine from the pool next door. It's early fall, the sun still clinging to the end of the day with an unhealthy intensity that makes even the usually cheery facade of the school feel oppressive. The parking lot is dotted with rust-colored SUVs and beat-up minivans - a familiar symphony of parental anxieties about their children's futures playing out on every corner. 

## Character: 

**Ms. Amelia "Amy" Carter,**  a woman whose carefully manicured eyebrows perfectly frame the worn lines etched across her face, knows this well. Twenty years she’d spent navigating the labyrinthine corridors of Sunnyview, witnessing first-hand the burgeoning hopes and crippling insecurities of a generation who seemed more concerned with their TikTok followers than their own futures.  

## Story Opening: 

"So," Ms. Carter began, peering over her thick glasses at Mr. Henderson, whose face was redder than his tie, "You're here for your... " she paused, drawing the word out like a painful sigh - **first-ever college application**. Mr. Henderson swallowed hard, fiddling with his worn leather wallet. 

"I'm just not sure what I want to do," he confessed, voice cracking slightly. "Ever since this whole 'finding yourself' thing became so popular..." He trailed off, frustration simmering in his eyes. The air hung heavy around them, the silence punctuated by the faint buzz of the fluorescent lights overhead. Ms. Carter felt a familiar ache settle in her chest, an echo of countless conversations she’d had with hopeful yet terrified teenagers like Mr. Henderson. 

“I get it,” she whispered, leaning forward. “But maybe we don't have to figure everything out before applying.” She looked at him, her eyes crinkled with a mix of understanding and unwavering belief.  "Maybe we just start by choosing the first step."
