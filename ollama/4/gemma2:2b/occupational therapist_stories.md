The gentle clink of metal against metal was the only sound in Dr. Amelia Thorne's clinic, a stark contrast to the usual cacophony of her day at the hospital. Outside, autumn leaves danced in an ethereal dance, their fiery colours muted by the persistent grey clouds that had lingered over Chicago for weeks. The air smelled of wet asphalt and fading summer memories. Inside, Amelia’s focus was on Elias Peterson, a 20-year-old aspiring musician whose dreams seemed to be as fragile as his fractured wrist. 

Elias sat in her therapy room, an oversized armchair cradling him in an uneasy stillness. His fingers, normally expressive, were now tightly wrapped around a small notebook, each page filled with intricate musical notations and doodles that spoke of a soul yearning to sing. Amelia, wearing her signature blue scrubs and a tired smile, adjusted the straps of her backpack, a worn canvas bag overflowing with tools – from bulky rubber balls for grip exercises to tiny, colorful blocks for fine motor skills. 

“Ready for our first session, Elias?” she asked softly, trying to inject a spark into his listless demeanor. The air felt heavy with unspoken anxieties and the weight of a silence that seemed to press down on them both.
