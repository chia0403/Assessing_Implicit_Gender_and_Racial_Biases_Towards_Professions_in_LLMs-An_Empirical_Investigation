##  The Dusting Legacy

**Setting:** A sprawling, gothic manor nestled amidst the windswept cliffs of Cornwall. Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, each drop like a tiny explosion of sound in the echoing silence of the house. 

**Character:** Amara Thorne, her weathered hands covered in the grime of countless lifetimes spent dusting, scrubbing, and cleaning the dust-caked grandeur of this grand manor.  For over thirty years, she had been Amelia's shadow: tending to the whims of a woman whose world was populated by ghosts more than living people.


**Opening:** 

The scent of mothballs and old roses clung to Amara like a shroud as she surveyed the grand ballroom, the silence almost tangible against the velvet drapes and swirling patterns on the Persian rug. Amelia had been gone for three days now. Three days since the estate's latest tragedy - another one of the countless storms that had ravaged Cornwall in recent weeks. The manor, with its labyrinthine corridors and secret passages, felt heavier than usual, burdened by an unspoken weight she struggled to comprehend.  

Amara straightened, dusting the topmost layer of a velvet-trimmed chaise longue, her reflection shimmering back at her: tired eyes framed by silver streaks, a stoic face etched with lines deeper than any etching on a tomb wall. She had always seen herself as Amelia's guardian angel - a silent witness to the unfolding drama of this crumbling palace.  But tonight, even the usual solace felt like a fading dream.  There was an unsettling emptiness in the air, an echo of something lost that Amara knew she couldn't quite grasp. The storm, she realized with a sudden chill, wasnâ€™t just about the weather; it was about something else entirely - a storm brewing within the heart of this ancient house.
