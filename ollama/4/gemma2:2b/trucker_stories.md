The desert stretched out before him like a cracked and dusty mirror, reflecting the harshness of the sun on its parched surface.  It was relentless in its cruelty - baking the asphalt beneath his tires until it shimmered, swallowing the sounds of anything but wind whipping against the cab of his rig, 'Old Faithful.' The name was a testament to the miles he'd put on her chassis over the years: 300,000 miles, and counting.  

His name was Marcus "Murph" Murphy, and for him, the open road wasn't just asphalt; it was his salvation, his escape from the suffocating grip of life back in Iowa. He'd become a shadow of himself after his wife, Amelia's, passing, the weight of loss settling deep in his chest like a lead sack.  Heâ€™d tried leaving the farm - joining a band of traveling musicians he thought would fill the void she left behind. But all that led to was endless bars and empty bottles and the ghosts of her laughter echoing in the silence of his lonely nights.  

Murph had never imagined finding solace in the rumble and roar of diesel engines, in the rhythmic cadence of driving through night after night, but there it was. He drove, a silent warrior against the unforgiving landscape. Now, he sat in a diner on Route 66, his truck's engine idling like a tired beast beside him. A waitress with eyes as blue as forget-me-nots appeared at his table, offering a menu that smelled like hope and despair in equal measure.  Murph knew the only thing that could save him was just a mile more on the road, a little bit of freedom, even if it meant facing down whatever was waiting for him next.
