## The Open House

**Setting:**  A sun-bleached Victorian on Elm Street in Savannah, Georgia. It’s mid-October, and the air holds the scent of decaying leaves and simmering Spanish moss, a melancholic melody against the backdrop of a late summer storm.

**Main Character:** Evelyn Blackwood, known to some as "Ellie" or "The Black Widow," is a real estate agent who's been navigating the choppy waters of Savannah's historic market for years.  Despite her fierce independence and sharp wit, she often finds herself haunted by the past - particularly the unsolved disappearance of her grandmother years ago. 

**Story Opening:**

Rain slapped against the windowpanes as Ellie stood on the porch of a grand old Victorian with peeling paint and ivy creeping up its decaying brick facade.  The house throbbed with a quiet melancholy, its faded grandeur mirroring the weight in Ellie's own chest. Today was the opening for the estate sale of Mrs. Amelia Cartwright’s sprawling home. An elegant woman known as the “Iron Lady” of Savannah’s elite, Amelia had passed away suddenly, leaving behind a legacy of whispers and hidden secrets. 

A sudden gust of wind sent a sheet of rain down Ellie's face, stinging her cheeks. She adjusted her glasses and glanced at the listing notes clutched tightly in her hand. It was an open-house invitation for a house teeming with stories - both spoken and unspoken. Ellie took a deep breath, the humidity clinging to the air like a ghost from Amelia’s past.  

Tonight, she would unravel the mysteries of this crumbling beauty, one keyhole at a time.
