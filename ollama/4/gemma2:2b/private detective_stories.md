The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Arthur "Ace" Blackwood's office like a thousand tiny fists pummeling a wet canvas. Inside, Ace hunched over his desk, cigarette smoke curling from his lips and blurring the already faded map of the city he was studying. It was a messy affair – crumpled bills, half-empty coffee mugs, and an ever-growing pile of empty liquor bottles – but it was also Ace's sanctuary. 

A worn leather briefcase sat on his desk, its metal clasp scratched from years of use. Inside it was a jumble of files, each containing the life story of another victim, another shadow in the city’s dark underbelly. A case, Ace knew, he couldn't just turn away from – even if it meant losing his own soul to the muck and mire of this city that held its breath for answers every night.

His name was Arthur Blackwood, but everyone called him Ace. An apt nickname considering his history with women – a whirlwind of lost loves and abandoned promises. But tonight, Ace wasn't thinking about love or loss. He was focused on unraveling the mystery of Mrs. Evelyn Thorne, a woman who claimed her husband had been murdered by the very mobsters that ran this city like a playground of their own making.  

Ace knew it wouldn’t be easy; the police were already circling, and the city’s underbelly held secrets tighter than any bank vault. But Ace was no stranger to fighting against the odds, even if he often felt outnumbered by his own demons. Tonight, though, something in Mrs. Thorne's plea for justice resonated with him, a flicker of hope amidst the encroaching darkness. He needed answers - and he would find them.
