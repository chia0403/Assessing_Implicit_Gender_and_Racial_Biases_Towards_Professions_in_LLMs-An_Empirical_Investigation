The biting wind whipped Amelia's auburn hair around her face as she held up her hand to shield it from the onslaught of snowflakes. A wave of coughs escaped the group behind her, their breath fogging in the frigid air of the Scottish Highlands.  "Just think," she chirped brightly, trying to break the tension that had settled over them after an unfortunate detour due to a flock of sheep refusing to budge from the path. "This is why you guys booked me as your guide! It wouldn't be a proper tour without a bit of... rustic charm."

Her gaze flitted across the faces of her guests – a rambunctious group of students from California, wide-eyed with wonder and a sprinkle of nervous energy. The imposing stone buildings of Dunrobin Castle loomed closer in the distance, their silhouette framed against the swirling snowstorm. Amelia's name echoed around them - Amelia Blackwood, the "charmingly unconventional" tour guide who had an uncanny knack for making history come alive in her stories and even more so for weaving a tale or two. 

They were here in the heart of the Scottish Highlands to uncover a legacy steeped in mystery – the story of King Aodhán mac Eochaidh, whose tomb lay beneath the ancient castle walls. Amelia's eyes twinkled, reflecting the faint, ethereal light filtering through the snowstorm. "And wouldn't you know it," she whispered conspiratorially, “rumours say that even on a day like this, he’s still whispering secrets."  She raised an eyebrow, adding with a sly grin, "You just might be able to hear them if you listen close enough." 

The students huddled together, their excitement now palpable, eager to unlock the secrets whispered by the wind and the snow.
