## The Midnight Shift

**Setting:** A neon-lit diner perched on the edge of town, its weathered exterior barely surviving the harsh winters of rural Maine.  The place smelled perpetually of greasy bacon and stale coffee. 

**Character:** Amelia “Amy” Thorne, age 21, with hair pulled back in a messy bun and hands that seemed to have a life of their own – calloused from years of handling cash registers and endless cups of sugary sodas. She’d been working the midnight shift at The Rusty Spoon Diner for two years now, her only companions the late-night chatter of patrons and the occasional stray howl of a dog on the wind. 

**Opening:**

"Next!" Amy barked out, her voice barely audible over the hum of fluorescent lights. The diner was almost empty, save for a solitary old man at the counter, sipping something strong and dark that only he seemed to know the recipe for. The clock ticked past two am, each second echoing the slow, methodical beat of a lonely heart.  It wasn't the kind of place anyone wanted to be at midnight; not without the company of others, anyway. And yet, Amy felt strangely content. 

She glanced over her shoulder, the familiar ache in her bones settling as she scanned the last few customers lingering near the door. The town outside seemed to sleep – a blanket of snow hushed its usual sounds as if it knew the weight of the quiet pressing down on everyone. This was her world; this was the Midnight Shift.
