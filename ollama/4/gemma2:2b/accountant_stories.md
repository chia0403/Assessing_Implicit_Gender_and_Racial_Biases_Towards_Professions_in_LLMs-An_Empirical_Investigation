The fluorescent hum of the office was as constant as the pressure building in Gregory Thorne's chest. His cubicle, tucked away on the 10th floor, offered the illusion of anonymity -  a stark contrast to the storm raging outside. Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the chaos that seemed to have taken root within him. He adjusted his glasses, the thin wire digging into his nose, and let out a shaky breath. It wasn't just the rain or the impending audit. The entire system was crumbling. 

The year was 2047. Global economic instability had left governments clinging to precarious balances of power, each struggling for a tiny advantage in the treacherous landscape of currency exchange. Gregory, with his meticulous spreadsheets and dry sense of logic, had always thrived on control, meticulously crunching numbers to keep things running smoothly within Thorne & Sons - an accounting firm that was as old-school as its name suggested. But lately, even the most finely crafted projections seemed destined to fail.  

A shadow fell across his desk. He looked up and saw his mentor, Arthur Thorne, a man whose steely gaze had once held a quiet power, now clouded with concern. "The market's shifting, Gregory," Arthur said, his voice as gravelly as the rain on the windowpane. "There might be some... unexpected turbulence."
