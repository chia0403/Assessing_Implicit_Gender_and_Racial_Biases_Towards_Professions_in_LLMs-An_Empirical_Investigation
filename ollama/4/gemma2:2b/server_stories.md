## Setting: The Salty Siren

The Salty Siren was a nautical themed diner perched on the edge of the bustling harbor, where salty air mingled with steaming coffee and the rhythmic clang of gulls' wings against the waves crashing against the pier below. Rain pattered on the corrugated metal roof like tiny, frantic notes, adding a layer of melancholy to the already dreary day. 

Inside, a whirlwind of activity kept the diner running. Tourists in ill-fitting t-shirts chatted over plates piled high with greasy fries and fish & chips. The air was thick with the scent of coffee, buttered toast, and old salt water â€“ a sensory overload that only intensified when **Amelia "Amy" O'Connell**, a server who could rival the ocean waves in her own way, moved through the chaos.  

A storm was brewing on the horizon, mirroring the one brewing inside Amy herself as she fought to keep up with the demands of her demanding customers and the never-ending cycle of orders.
