##  Opening Scene:

Rain lashed against the windowpane of Daniel "Danny" O'Malley's office like tiny, relentless hammers. Outside, the storm mirrored the chaotic jumble of emotions churning in his gut. The phone on his desk buzzed with another frantic call from Mrs. Henderson - her parrot had apparently gotten loose and was causing a scene at their neighbor's house. "It's just feathers," she'd said, voice strained, "but my insurance policy..." 

Danny sighed, rubbing his tired eyes. The job wasn't exactly fulfilling.  He'd dreamt of being an author all his life, but reality had thrown him a hard curve and landed him in the dreary world of insurance claims. He ran a weary hand through his thinning hair, watching the storm outside grow wilder. This city was a beast, churning and spitting with fury, just like his own soul right now.
