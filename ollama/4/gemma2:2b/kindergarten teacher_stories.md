The morning air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and freshly cut grass as Ms. Eleanor Peabody settled her stack of brightly colored flashcards on the table. Her classroom, 'Little Explorers,' buzzed with the anticipatory chaos of kindergarteners.  She straightened the blue bow on her name tag, a faint echo of the vibrant purple hair ribbon she'd worn in her own childhood.

Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating Ms. Peabody's neatly arranged classroom â€“ a rainbow explosion of alphabet charts and animal figurines. But today, something felt different. The usual cheerful chatter had been replaced with an undercurrent of anxious whispers, punctuated by the occasional stifled sob. 

The first to reach her was Thomas, his small hand clutching a crumpled paper boat, his face streaked with tears. "Ms. Peabody, Mr. Henry... he's gone!" he declared in between sobs, before dropping the boat into Ms. Peabody's lap. A wave of quiet panic washed over her as she took note of the little boy's distress. The incident was already being whispered about in the hushed tones of other kids and parents, a dark cloud hanging over their normally joyous world.
