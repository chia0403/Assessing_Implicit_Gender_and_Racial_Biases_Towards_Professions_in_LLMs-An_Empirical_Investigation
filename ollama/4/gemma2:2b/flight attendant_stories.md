## The Girl With Silver Wings:

**Setting:**  A luxurious first-class cabin aboard Air Atlantis's "Zenith" aircraft, soaring through the cobalt depths of the Pacific Ocean at 35,000 feet. The sun dips below the horizon, painting streaks of orange and gold across the clouds. 

**Main Character:** Celeste "Cee" Evermore, her silver-blonde hair swept back in a neat chignon, expertly navigates the crowded first-class aisle with a calm grace.  Her smile is as polished as her navy blue uniform, reflecting both the shimmering ocean outside and the inner peace she cultivates within herself. 

**Opening:** "Another one for the road?" Celeste's voice, soft yet melodic, drifted over the hum of the engines. She gently placed a steaming cup of chamomile tea on Mrs. Beaumont's aged lap, whose eyes, magnified by thick spectacles, flickered with curiosity.  "It's quite a sight, isn't it? The Earth shrinking away beneath us." 

Mrs. Beaumont chuckled, her voice raspy but warm. "The ocean is a fickle beast, darling. One moment serene, the nextâ€¦ churning. This view reminds me of my youth on those coastal islands you visit often..." she trailed off, a wistful expression crossing her face.  

Cee knew this was more than just a routine act. She understood that Mrs. Beaumont's "churning" referred to something deeper: The turbulence in her daughter's life back home, the same turbulence that had been plaguing Mrs. Beaumont for years.

**What happens next? Will Cee offer solace or will she be pulled into another layer of the mystery?**
