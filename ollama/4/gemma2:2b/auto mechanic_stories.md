The smell of motor oil, hot grease, and burnt rubber hung thick in the air like a second skin. It was a familiar scent to Elias Thorne, a symphony of machinery that he knew by heart. His garage, "Thorne's Garage," nestled in the heart of old town Willow Creek, seemed almost timeless. The red brick facade held onto its charm, with peeling paint and chipped window panes, like a weathered smile on an old friend.  

Elias was meticulously tracing the intricate circuit board of a beat-up 1957 Ford Thunderbird, his hands calloused but nimble. His shop wasn't just a place to fix cars; it was a refuge, a space where he could lose himself in the world of metal and gasoline. He was known for fixing everything from rusty vintage classics to sputtering family sedans, even the occasional broken-down farm equipment that kept the local farmers afloat. 

But today was different. Today, an air of unease hung in the garage like a storm cloud. Elias couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. A quiet hum he usually ignored had become a persistent buzz, an itch at the back of his mind, a warning from the soul of his beloved machines.
