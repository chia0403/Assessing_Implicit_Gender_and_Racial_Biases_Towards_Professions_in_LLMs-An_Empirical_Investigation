The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia’s head like trapped cicadas. Dust motes danced in the pale sunbeams filtering through the window, illuminating the sterile white walls of The Grove Rehabilitation Center.  A symphony of creaking wheelchairs and rhythmic beeping from medical machines filled the air as she made her rounds, checking on her patients - each more frail and broken than the last. Amelia was a Physical Therapist here, a woman forged in the crucible of human struggle and fueled by the desire to rebuild hope where it had been shattered. 

Today, however, something felt off. The usual disquiet that permeated the air, a mixture of pain, vulnerability, and determination, hung heavier than usual. A deep unease settled in Amelia's chest as she stopped before the doorway of Mr. Peterson's room. It wasn't just his stiff gait or the tremors in his hands – something felt...off. There was a weight to it, a suffocating sense of finality that clung like damp fog. 

Amelia took a deep breath, and with each exhale she felt her anxiety rise. She knew this wasn't just about Mr. Peterson's recovery anymore. This time, the weight of unspoken words hung heavy in the air – an undercurrent of despair, maybe even fear.  Something was different, and she had to find out what it meant.
