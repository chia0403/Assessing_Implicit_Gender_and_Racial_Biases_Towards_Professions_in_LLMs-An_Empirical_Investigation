Rain lashed against the worn windshield of the Cat 797, each drop exploding in miniature geysers as it cascaded off the hood.  **Bartholomew “Bart” Miller**, his thick, salt-and-pepper beard plastered to his chin with sweat and grime, gritted his teeth. He’d been driving for nearly twelve hours straight, dodging gravel storms and weaving through thick fog on the desolate stretch of Wyoming highway. The old machine groaned under him like an arthritic beast, each bump sending a shudder through its steel frame.  The engine's monotonous hum was a soundtrack to Bart's growing fatigue. 

His destination was a remote construction site deep in the heart of the Beartooth Mountains. Bart wasn't some city slicker; he was born and raised on this rugged terrain, his hands calloused and toughened by years of operating heavy machinery like an extension of himself.  He’d inherited his father’s love for these earth-moving behemoths, a legacy passed down through generations of men and machines working together. The mountain was silent except for the rhythmic clink of tools against metal and the occasional bleat of a distant sheep. 

But Bart wasn't going for a peaceful stroll in nature.  He was on a mission: to bring down an ancient, crumbling dam before its inevitable collapse would send a tidal wave of mudslide cascading through the mountain villages below. And he needed to do it fast. A ticking time bomb.
