## The Sunken Seed

**Setting:**  The rolling hills of Meadowbrook farm are blanketed in the soft haze of dawn. Dew-drops cling precariously to the last straggling leaves of corn that stood defiant against the night's chill, their faces already wilting under the unrelenting rays of the morning sun.  A lone barn stands sentinel on the far side of a field choked with tall grass and swaying in the faint breeze. 

**Character:** Elias Hawthorne. A man weathered like an old oak, his hands gnarled by years spent tilling the soil. His face, though etched with lines of toil and worry, still bears the hopeful glint of youth. Even with his stoicism, a deep sadness lingers within him, as if the earth itself had stolen something precious from him. 


**Opening:**  Elias was alone again. The silence of the farm was deafening, broken only by the occasional bleating of sheep or the rustle of unseen creatures in the tall grass. Heâ€™d spent hours staring at the barren patch in his field, the sunken seed he'd planted so meticulously a stark reminder of what had been lost.  This wasn't just a failed harvest; it was a failure of spirit, a testament to the relentless march of time and the cruel hand of fate. The seeds had never sprouted, their delicate souls never awakening under the sun. What would he do?
