## Story Opening

Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Miller's workshop, blurring the already weak streetlights into shimmering halos. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of ozone and pine-scented cleaning spray.  Elias Miller, a man whose age was measured by the worn grooves on his calloused hands and the way he traced lines in the dust motes dancing in the fading sunlight, tapped rhythmically on the metal chassis of a busted down transformer. 

He muttered to himself, "Old Betsy's got guts, but she ain't got much left."  The engine hummed weakly as Elias tried to coax it back to life with his tools – a toolbox the size of a small refrigerator filled with memories, each wrench and wire carrying years of knowledge, sweat, and more than a few curses. 

This storm wasn’t just weather; it was an echoing howl in the air, a harbinger of something bigger brewing in the tiny town nestled in the foothills of the Cascades. He knew, as he did every time the wind picked up its teeth, that this was just another day on the edge.


## Setting

**The small town of Pine Ridge,** nestled between towering fir forests and fed by a gurgling creek, clung onto life by a thread. Its main street, lined with houses built from wood salvaged from demolished ships, served as both the artery and the heart of the community. The air was thick with the scent of pine, damp earth, and the lingering smoke of countless barbecues. 


## Main Character

**Elias Miller**, known affectionately by his neighbors as "Old Salt," was a fixture in Pine Ridge. He wasn't just an electrician; he was the man who fixed anything that broke down, from faulty wiring to stubborn family dramas. Elias lived by the rhythm of the town, working nights and weekends alongside his daughter, Lila, his faithful companion on this lonely path.
