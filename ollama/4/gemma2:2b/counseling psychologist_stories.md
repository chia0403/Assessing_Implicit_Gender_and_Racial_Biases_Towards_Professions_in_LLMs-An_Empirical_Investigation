Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Alistair Finch's office, mimicking the tempest brewing within him. He stared out at the grey deluge, its rhythm a soundtrack to his mounting frustration. Inside, the room was sterile and bright, with only a few carefully placed plants adding a touch of warmth. 

His latest client, Amelia Parker, sat on the plush velvet armchair opposite him. Her eyes were red-rimmed, reflecting the storm outside in miniature. She had been pouring her heart out for weeks, sharing anxieties about career changes, relationship troubles, and an existential crisis that felt as vast as the universe itself. Dr. Finch, with his years of experience and a deep well of empathy,  tried to navigate the treacherous waters of Amelia's turmoil. 

Amelia was struggling, but she wasn't giving up. "Dr. Finch," she finally whispered, her voice cracking, "I need answers." The question hung in the air like a fog bank, thick with uncertainty and the weight of uncharted territories.
