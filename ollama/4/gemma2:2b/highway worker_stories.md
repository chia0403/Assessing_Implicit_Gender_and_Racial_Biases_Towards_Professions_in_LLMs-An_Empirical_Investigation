The air hung heavy with the scent of diesel fuel and hot asphalt as Raymond "Ray" Miller, his face still smudged with grime from a recent pothole repair, watched the sun beat down on the cracked concrete barrier that bordered Interstate 80.  It was the kind of afternoon in Nebraska where even the cows seemed to be wearing shades against the relentless glare. Ray sighed, rubbing his aching neck and pulling off his worn-out ball cap. He'd been working on this stretch for nearly a year now, ever since his father had gotten sick, forcing him to take over the family business. 

Ray was used to the long hours and endless grind, but something in the way the sun reflected off the asphalt today seemed to amplify the vastness of it all. It wasn't just the heat; it was an undercurrent of unspoken loneliness that he couldn't quite shake off. Ray felt like a lone rock on a barren desert plateau, alone beneath the endless expanse of highway and sky. His only companion was a battered pick-up truck that sputtered and coughed with the weight of his anxieties, parked nearby just like a lonely shadow under the vast blue sky.  The monotony had its own silent language, and he knew it all too well.
