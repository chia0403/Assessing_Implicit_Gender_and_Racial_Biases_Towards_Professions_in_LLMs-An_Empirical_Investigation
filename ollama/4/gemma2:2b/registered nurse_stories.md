## Setting: 

The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across the sterile walls of Mercy General Hospital's intensive care unit.  Rain lashed against the windows like angry fingers, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Grant. A young mother, no older than twenty-two, lay hooked to machines in a bed bathed in blue light. Her tiny body was a tableau of vulnerability, a stark contrast to the imposing steel and glass that housed her. 

## Opening:

Amelia's heart pounded against her ribs like a captive bird desperately trying to fly free. It wasn't the usual adrenaline rush she felt when performing life-saving surgery. This time, the weight of it all pressed down on her like a physical force.  Her hands, usually steady and confident, trembled slightly as she checked her patient's vitals one last time before the shift change. 

"Amelia?"  Dr. Chen's voice sliced through the silence, his eyes grave. "How did she get this severe? We couldn't stabilize her during the transfer."
