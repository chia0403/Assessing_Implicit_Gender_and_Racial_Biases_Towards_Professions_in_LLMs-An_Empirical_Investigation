## The Guard's Oath

**Opening:** A chill wind whipped through the stone arches of Castle Evermore, carrying the scent of rain and damp earth. The old city walls, battered by centuries of storms and time, creaked in protest against every gust. Inside the imposing castle, its towers rising like skeletal fingers into the stormy sky, Sergeant Alaric Thorne stood sentinel at the outer gatehouse. His uniform, once pristine white, was now stained with streaks of grime and ash from his arduous watch.

**Setting:** Castle Evermore stands as an island of stone amidst a wild landscape, its high ramparts overlooking the swirling mists of the Sea of Shadows. The city below is shrouded in a perpetual twilight, a testament to the ancient curse that plagues the land â€“ a darkness clinging forever to the mortal realm. 

**Main Character:** Sergeant Alaric Thorne - A grizzled veteran of countless battles against creatures of shadow and nightmare, his face etched with lines of both war and weariness. He's known for his unwavering loyalty to the castle and its inhabitants, and his quiet, almost stoic demeanor masking a deep-seated sense of duty and responsibility.

**Narrative Hook:** Alaric had sworn an oath - centuries ago - to protect the inhabitants of Evermore from the horrors that lurk in the darkness. But tonight, a sense of foreboding settled upon him like a shroud. Whispers of an approaching storm, whispered by the wind itself, seemed to echo a dire portent. He felt a prickle of fear on the back of his neck, a feeling he couldn't quite place.
