Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Mine, casting a golden glow over the dusty terrain and the array of heavy machinery that lined its edges. Amidst this industrial landscape, 32-year-old Axel Ryder stood confidently atop his favorite machine, a Caterpillar 797F articulated haul truck named Bertha.

Axel had spent the better part of a decade operating Bertha, watching her grow from a young buck into a reliable workhorse of the mine's heavy equipment fleet. He took pride in knowing every inch of her mechanical heart, every quirk and idiosyncrasy that made her perform at peak efficiency. As he checked the truck's vital signs – hydraulic pressure, engine RPM, fuel levels – Axel felt a sense of comfort and control wash over him.

The mine was a behemoth of an operation, stretching across hundreds of acres in the Arizona desert. It employed thousands of workers, from seasoned miners to fresh-faced rookies like the young operator who had just taken Axel's place on Bertha for a day's shift. The air was thick with the smell of diesel fuel and sweat, and the only sounds were the distant rumble of drills and the creaking of the desert wind through the rocky outcroppings.

Axel's thoughts, however, were elsewhere. He had received a cryptic message from an old friend just hours before, hinting at a long-buried secret that threatened to upend his life forever. As he waited for Bertha to finish her shift and head back to the depot, Axel couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change – and not necessarily for the better.
