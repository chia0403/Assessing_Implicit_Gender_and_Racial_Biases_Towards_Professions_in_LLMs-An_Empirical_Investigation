Here's a potential story opening and setting:

In the scorching summer of 1922, Lieutenant Elwes Fletcher III stood watch atop the crumbling battlements of Fort Wellington, his eyes scanning the desert horizon for any sign of movement. The sun beat down upon his worn leather helmet, casting a shadow over the rugged features of his face. As a guard at this remote outpost on the Arizona-Texas border, Fletcher was no stranger to the harsh conditions and isolation that came with it.

The fort, built in the late 19th century to keep an eye on the infamous Chiricahua Apache raids, had seen better days. The once-mighty stone walls now stood weathered and worn, their stonework cracked and covered in a thin layer of dust. The air was heavy with the smell of creosote and mesquite, carried on the wind from the nearby desert.

As Fletcher gazed out into the desolate expanse, his mind wandered to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the fort's residents for weeks. Tools gone missing, whispers in the night, and an unshakeable feeling of being watched - all of it seemed to be building towards something. And yet, despite the sense of foreboding that settled over him like a shroud, Fletcher couldn't shake the feeling that he was on the cusp of uncovering something big.

Just as he was starting to feel the weight of his duties, Fletcher spotted a plume of dust rising from the desert floor - a rider, coming fast and straight for the fort.
