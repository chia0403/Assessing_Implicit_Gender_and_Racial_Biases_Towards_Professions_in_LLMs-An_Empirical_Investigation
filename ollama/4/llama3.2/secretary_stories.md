Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain pattered against the windows of Emma Elara Wilson's small, cluttered office like a relentless drumbeat, casting a gloomy shadow over the cramped cubicle she had called home for five years. As the chief administrative assistant to the city's beleaguered mayor, Henry Lee, Emma was no stranger to drizzle and gray skies. But on this particular day, something felt different - a sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach like a cold stone, refusing to be shaken.

Emma sighed, pushing back her hair, which had escaped its ponytail and tangled itself around her face. She rubbed the tired creases from her eyes, wincing as the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum with an extra sharpness, casting an unforgiving glare over her worn office furniture. It was going on 5 PM, and the city's offices were still buzzing with late-afternoon activity - a testament to Henry Lee's unyielding dedication to his constituents, even if it meant sacrificing what little personal time he had.

The phone on Emma's desk jolted her back into reality, shrill and insistent. She picked up the receiver, her hand steady despite the faint tremble she couldn't shake. "City Hall, this is Emma."
