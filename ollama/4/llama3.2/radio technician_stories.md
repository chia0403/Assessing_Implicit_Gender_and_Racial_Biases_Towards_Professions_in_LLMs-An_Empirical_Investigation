Here's a potential story opening:

---

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. The rain-soaked streets were empty, save for the occasional car driving by with its headlights shining through the misty veil that shrouded the town.

Inside his cozy workshop, radio technician Julian Everett Harris huddled over a tangle of wires and circuit boards, trying to coax a stubborn signal out of a vintage transmitter. The workshop was cluttered with boxes of assorted parts, dusty old manuals, and the faint scent of solder wafting through the air. A small sign above his workbench read "Julian E. Harris - Electronics Repair & Radio Restoration."

As he worked, Julian's mind wandered to the mysterious letter that had arrived earlier that day. The envelope was plain white, with no return address or indication of who might have sent it. All that was written on it was a single sentence: "Come to the old lighthouse at midnight if you want to know the truth about your past."

Julian's curiosity was piqued. He had always known he was an orphan, raised by his widowed grandmother after his parents' tragic death in a car accident when he was just a child. But there were gaps in his memory, and strange dreams that hinted at a life before Ravenswood.

He looked up from the transmitter, his eyes locking onto the clock on the wall: 11:45 PM. Time to make a decision.
