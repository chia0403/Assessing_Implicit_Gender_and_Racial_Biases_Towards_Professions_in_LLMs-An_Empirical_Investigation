The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood City gleamed like polished onyx under the faint moonlight, casting long shadows behind the crumbling Victorian mansions that lined the streets. Inside one such mansion, at 345 Elmwood Drive, the evening air was thick with tension.

Aurora "Rory" Winters, a private investigator with a reputation for being fearless and razor-sharp, stood outside her office, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee as she gazed out at the wet pavement. The neon sign above her door cast an eerie glow, reading "Winters Investigations" in bold, cursive letters.

Rory was a woman with a complex past - one that had driven her to become the best detective in Ashwood City's underworld. With piercing green eyes and raven-black hair that fell to her waist, she exuded an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention. Her sharp mind and quick wit had earned her a loyal client base among the city's most powerful figures.

As she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time, Rory knew she was running late. She had promised her client, the enigmatic billionaire Marcus Blackwood, that she would meet him at his mansion by 9 PM sharp. And now, as the clock ticked closer to 10, she was starting to get anxious.

With a deep breath, Rory slung her trench coat over her shoulders and stepped out into the night, ready to face whatever secrets Ashwood City had in store for her next case.
