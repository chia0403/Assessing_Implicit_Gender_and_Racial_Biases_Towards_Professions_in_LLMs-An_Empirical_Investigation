Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Portland gleamed like polished leather as Kaidën Everett trudged through the downpour, his worn brown boots splashing in the puddles that lined the sidewalk. It was a drizzly Wednesday evening, and Kaidën had just left another long day at work on the drafting floor of his small but respected architecture firm.

As he made his way back to his apartment, a faded coffee-stained notebook clutched in one hand and a soggy cigarette dangling from his lips, the city's neon lights seemed to blur together like wet paint. The towering skyscrapers that dominated the city's skyline loomed above him, their peaks shrouded in mist and cloud.

Kaidën shivered, feeling the familiar sting of loneliness as he turned onto his quiet street. His apartment was just a short walk from the office, but tonight it felt like a world away - a refuge from the frustrations and disappointments that had dogged him all day. As he fumbled for his key in the rain-soaked darkness, Kaidën couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting for him inside, watching him with cold, calculating eyes.

How's this? I tried to set the scene for a moody, atmospheric story with a focus on Kaidën's inner struggles. Let me know if you have any requests or changes!
