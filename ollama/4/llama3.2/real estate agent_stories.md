Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the sleepy coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint beachside homes and bustling boardwalk. It was a typical summer evening in late July, with tourists strolling along the shore, collecting seashells and enjoying the salty air.

In her sleek, silver sedan, real estate agent Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson cruised down Ocean Drive, scanning the neighborhood for potential listings to show to her clients. With over five years of experience under her belt, Lexi had seen it all - from beachside mansions to cozy bungalows with sea views. She was known for her keen eye and knack for matching buyers with their dream homes.

As she pulled up to a particularly promising property on Elm Street, Lexi's phone buzzed in her pocket. It was a text from her best friend and confidant, Rachel, who owned the local bakery: "Hey girl! Meet me at the Cove Caf√© in an hour. I need your help with something."

Lexi's curiosity was piqued - what could Rachel possibly need her expertise for? She smiled to herself as she pulled over to the curb, eager to find out what the evening had in store.

The Tidal Cove real estate market was about to get a whole lot more interesting...
