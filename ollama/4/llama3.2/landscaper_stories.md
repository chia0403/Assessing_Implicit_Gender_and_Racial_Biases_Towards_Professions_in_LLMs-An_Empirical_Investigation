As the first light of dawn crept over the small town of Willow Creek, Arizona, landscaping specialist Ethan James Thompson stepped out of his rusty old truck and onto the cracked asphalt of his driveway. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of mesquite trees and the distant hint of rain. It was a rare sight in these parts, but one that brought a smile to Ethan's face nonetheless.

Ethan lived on the outskirts of Willow Creek, where the desert landscape stretched out as far as the eye could see. He had spent his entire life here, learning the ins and outs of the land from his father, a fellow landscaper who had passed away a few years ago. Now, at 35, Ethan was the one who ran the family business, Thompson's Landscaping.

As he breathed in the morning air, Ethan gazed out at the small spread of his property, where a few scrubby cacti and a half-dozen prickly pear plants struggled to survive in the arid soil. It wasn't much, but it was home, and Ethan loved it here. Little did he know that this ordinary day would soon become anything but ordinary, as a mysterious phone call from an unknown number would set off a chain of events that would change his life forever.
