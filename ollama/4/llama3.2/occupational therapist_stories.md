Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled off the Pacific Ocean like a damp blanket, shrouding the small coastal town of Tidal Cove in a misty veil. It was a fitting accompaniment to the mood that had settled over Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, occupational therapist and owner of Coastal Therapy Services.

Lexi stood at the edge of the oceanfront office building, her eyes fixed on the sea as she stared out at the waves crashing against the shore. The sound was like a constant hum in her mind, a reminder that even as the world outside seemed to be moving forward, some things remained still and steadfast. Like the ocean.

As she gazed out at the water, Lexi's thoughts turned to her latest client, a young boy named Jack who had been referred to her by his parents after a traumatic accident left him with severe physical and emotional scars. She had met with Jack just that morning, watching as he struggled to perform even the simplest tasks, like buttoning his shirt or using a pencil.

Despite the challenges they faced, Lexi felt a spark of hope ignite within her. She knew that with patience, persistence, and the right approach, she could help Jack rebuild his skills and rediscover the joys of everyday life. And as the fog swirled around her, Lexi felt a sense of resolve wash over her: today was just the beginning of their journey together.

The oceanfront office building, once a bustling hub of activity, now stood quiet and still, its occupants either absent or huddled indoors, seeking refuge from the misty morning. But Lexi knew that she wasn't alone. She had Jack's story etched in her mind, and she was ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead, one wave at a time.
