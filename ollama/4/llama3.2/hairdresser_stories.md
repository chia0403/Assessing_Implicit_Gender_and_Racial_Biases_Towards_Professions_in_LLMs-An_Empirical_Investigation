Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn morning in the small coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, where the salty air carried the sweet scent of saltwater and the sound of seagulls filled the air. In a cozy little shop nestled between a vintage bookstore and a seafood restaurant, Ember Rose Wellington adjusted her scissors and surveyed her latest client, a frazzled young woman named Lily.

As a fourth-generation hairdresser, Ember had grown up watching her grandmother work her magic on clients' locks in their family's salon, which had been passed down through generations. Now, at 28 years old, Ember was the proud owner of her own shop, "Tidal Waves," where she spent her days coaxing color and style from the most unruly manes.

The phone rang, shrill and insistent, breaking the silence between Ember and Lily as they chatted about everything from the latest fashion trends to their shared love of indie folk music. With a warm smile, Ember picked up the receiver, ready to face whatever new day had in store for her and her clients at Tidal Waves.

How's that? I've created a cozy setting and introduced Ember, our hairdresser protagonist. Feel free to modify or discard as you see fit!
