Here's a potential story opening:

---

The fog rolled in off the Thames, shrouding the streets of Whitechapel in a damp, gray mist that seemed to cling to everything it touched. It was a chill autumn evening in 1888, and the gas lamps that lined the cobblestone roads cast flickering shadows on the pavement below.

In his small shop, "Finley's Fresh Meats," located at the corner of Hanbury Street, Alexander Finley wiped the sweat from his forehead with a white apron. He had spent the better part of the day preparing for the evening's customers - a mix of local shopkeepers and workers who needed their meat supplies replenished before the night's work began.

Finley, a burly man in his mid-30s with a thick beard and a bushy eyebrow, surveyed his store with a practiced eye. The display cases were full of plump sausages, neatly wrapped packages of bacon, and fresh racks of lamb. His hands, deft from years of handling raw meat, moved quickly as he arranged the offerings.

Just as Finley was about to lock up for the night, the door swung open and a tall, gaunt figure strode in, casting a long shadow across the shop. The man's eyes, sunken and dark, scanned the store with an unnerving intensity that made Finley's hackles rise. He knew the type - a customer who came to his shop seeking more than just meat.

"Evening, sir," Finley said gruffly, trying to keep his tone neutral despite the growing sense of unease that settled in the pit of his stomach. "What can I get for you tonight?"

The man's gaze locked onto Finley, and for a moment, it seemed as though he could see right through him - into the very soul of the butcher.

"I'll have a pound of your finest beef," the man said, his voice low and husky, like the rustling of dry leaves. "And something else. Something special."

Finley's instincts screamed warning, but he forced himself to smile and ask, "What might that be?"
