Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Double R Ranch, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and fields of golden wheat that stretched as far as the eye could see. At the heart of it all stood the rustic ranch house, its weathered wooden beams and tin roof a testament to generations of hard work and dedication.

Inside the ranch house, 32-year-old Ryder Jackson Brooks was scrubbing down the kitchen table with a mixture of soap and vinegar, his eyes fixed on the old calendar hanging from the wall. Today marked five years since his father's passing, and Ryder couldn't shake the feeling that it had been an eternity since he'd last felt like himself.

Ryder's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of his truck pulling into the driveway outside. He wiped down the table one last time before heading out to greet the unexpected visitor - his old friend and neighbor, Jace McCoy, who was known for showing up unannounced whenever something needed fixing or talking through.
