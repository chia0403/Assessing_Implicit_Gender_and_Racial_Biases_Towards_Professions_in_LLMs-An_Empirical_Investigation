Here's a potential story opening:

As she stepped out of the misty dawn, the rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like a canvas of dark blues and greys, casting a somber tone over the city. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a seasoned probation officer with over five years of experience, pulled her water-stained jacket tighter around her frame as she walked towards the coffee shop on 5th Avenue. She was already running late for her morning meeting with the local court officials to discuss the progress of her latest client.

The dimly lit interior of the coffee shop provided a brief respite from the drizzle, and Lexi slid onto a stool at the counter, ordering a black coffee in her gruff tone, accustomed to dealing with the harsh realities of her job. As she waited for her drink, her eyes wandered towards the small notebook on the edge of the counter, containing a cryptic message scrawled in hasty handwriting - 'Erebus is coming'. The words sent a shiver down her spine, and Lexi's mind began to wander about what could be the meaning behind this ominous warning.

This opening sets the tone for a darker and more suspenseful story, with Lexi as a complex and intriguing character.
