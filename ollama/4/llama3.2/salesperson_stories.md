Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy mist over the already-forgotten streets of downtown Metropolis. In a small, cramped office nestled between a vintage clothing store and a 24-hour diner, salesperson Emily Alexandra Wellesley sat hunched over her desk, staring blankly at the stack of unfulfilled orders in front of her.

At 27 years old, Emily was already well-versed in the art of persuasion, having spent years working for her father's small but successful import-export business. But despite her natural charm and quick wit, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing - a sense of purpose, perhaps, or a connection to something more meaningful than just making sales.

As she scanned the list of unfulfilled orders, Emily's eyes landed on one item in particular: a custom-made fountain for the new luxury high-rise going up in downtown Metropolis. The client had been pushing hard for it, but the project had stalled due to budget cuts and design changes. Emily felt a shiver run down her spine as she thought about the potential consequences of failing to deliver - not just for herself, but for the entire company.

With a deep breath, Emily pushed her chair back from the desk and stood up, surveying the drab office with fresh eyes. The fluorescent lights overhead seemed even more oppressive now, and the stale air reeked of desperation. It was time to take action - time to prove to herself, and everyone else, that she was more than just a salesperson.
