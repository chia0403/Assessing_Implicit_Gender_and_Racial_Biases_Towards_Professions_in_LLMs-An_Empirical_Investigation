Here's a potential story opening:

In the sweltering summer of 1955, Alexandria "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment in New Orleans' French Quarter and into the humid air that clung to the city like a wet blanket. As a reporter for the New Orleans Times-Picayune, Lexi had grown accustomed to the city's eccentricities, but tonight felt different. Tonight, the streets were alive with the sound of jazz drifting from the clubs on Bourbon Street, and the smell of beignets wafted from Cafe du Monde, enticing passersby to stop and sample the sweet treat.

Lexi pulled out her notebook and pen, tucking them into her purse as she made her way to the newspaper office. Her phone rang as she walked, shrill in the stillness of the night air. She hesitated for a moment before answering, knowing that whoever was on the other end wouldn't be calling with good news.

"Hey, I just got word from my source," said the low, gravelly voice on the other end of the line. "There's been another death at St. Anne's Asylum. Another one of your patients is gone."

Lexi's gut tightened as she stopped in front of the newspaper office, a faded brick building that seemed to lean inward, as if sharing secrets with its neighbors. She had written about the asylum's troubles before - the allegations of patient abuse, the rumors of supernatural occurrences that kept even the bravest journalists away.

But this was different," she said into her phone, trying to keep her voice steady. "Who is it? What happened?"

And then, just as she hit send on the line, a gust of wind swept through the streets, extinguishing the streetlights and plunging the city into darkness.

"Looks like we've got our story, Miss Thompson," said the voice on the other end of the line, before hanging up.
