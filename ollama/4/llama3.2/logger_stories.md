Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The mist-shrouded forest loomed above, its ancient trees standing sentinel like Nature's own cathedral. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a primordial aroma that seemed to seep into every pore. It was a smell that Evan McCormick knew all too well, one that evoked memories of long days spent felling giant trunks and hauling logs through the treacherous underbrush.

Evan, a rugged and weathered logger in his mid-40s, stepped out of his worn truck and onto the forest floor. His boots sank into the soft earth as he gazed up at the towering trees, their branches like skeletal fingers reaching for the sky. The sun was hidden behind a veil of clouds, casting the forest in an eerie, emerald green gloom.

It had been three years since Evan's last major logging job, one that had ended in tragedy when his crew was ambushed by a group of poachers. Since then, he'd been drifting from town to town, taking on small jobs and trying to put the memories behind him. But as he gazed out at the forest, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting for him in these woods, something that would draw him back into the world of logging and confront him with secrets and lies.

With a deep breath, Evan shouldered his pack and began to make his way through the underbrush, the weight of his axe slung over his shoulder like a mantle. He knew this forest like the back of his hand, every twist and turn, every hidden stream and every ancient standing tree. But he also knew that nothing was as it seemed in these woods, and that sometimes, the things you thought you knew best were the very things that would get you killed.

As he walked, the silence of the forest swallowed him whole, and Evan felt a shiver run down his spine. He had a feeling that he wasn't alone out here after all...
