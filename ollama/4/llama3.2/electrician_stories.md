Here's a potential story opening and setting for a tale involving an electrician:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as Jack Ryder, a seasoned electrician with over a decade of experience, stepped out of his pickup truck and onto the sidewalk. The neon signs of the city's bars and clubs reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the deserted street. Jack rubbed the weariness from his eyes, feeling the fatigue of a long night's work at the construction site where he'd been installing LED lighting for a new high-rise development.

As he gazed up at the towering skyscraper, its peak disappearing into the grey mist, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The building's electrical system had seemed unusually temperamental during his work, and he'd caught glimpses of flickering lights and erratic voltage readings that didn't quite add up to normal wear-and-tear.

With a deep breath, Jack shouldered his toolbox and began the short walk to the entrance of the building, where a stern-faced security guard eyed him warily from behind the reception desk. "Can I help you, Mr...?" the guard asked, eyeing Jack's worn jeans and faded denim jacket.

"I'm here about the job," Jack replied, flashing his ID and handing over his badge. "I was told to meet with someone at the top floor."

The guard nodded curtly and handed him a secure keycard. "Go ahead up. But be warned, Mr. Ryder: that building's got more problems than just a few dodgy wires."
