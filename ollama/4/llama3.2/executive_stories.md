Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had just set over the Manhattan skyline, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers of the financial district. In the heart of this bustling metropolis, the sleek glass and steel tower of the NovaTech Corporation pierced the sky like a shard of light.

Ava Elizabeth Thompson, a rising star in the corporate world, stood at the top of her 35th floor office, gazing out over the glittering lights of Times Square. As the Senior Vice President of Marketing for NovaTech, Ava had spent years climbing the corporate ladder, earning the respect and admiration of her peers through her cunning business sense and razor-sharp instincts.

Tonight, however, Ava's focus was not on the bright lights or the endless possibilities of the city below. Her mind was consumed by a nagging sense of unease, one that had been building for weeks. It started with small things: a discrepancy in the quarterly reports, an unexpected drop in market trends, a cryptic message from an anonymous source.

Now, as she stood at the edge of her office's expansive view, Ava couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Something big.

A gentle tap on her shoulder broke the spell, and Ava turned to face her assistant, Rachel Lee, who held a small, discreetly packaged folder in her hand.

"Ms. Thompson, your 6 o'clock meeting with Mr. Patel has been rescheduled for 7 pm," Rachel said, her voice low and even. "And, ma'am, I have some news that might interest you."

Ava's heart skipped a beat as she took the folder from Rachel. Inside, she found a single sheet of paper, bearing a message in Ava's own handwriting â€“ a code phrase, encrypted and unsigned.

The words danced on her mind like a whispered secret: "They're watching."

And with that, the world around Ava began to shift into high gear.
