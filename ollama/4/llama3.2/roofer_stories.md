Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the rows of quaint brick homes and rusty red roofs that seemed to stretch on forever. It was a typical autumn evening in this quintessential American town, where everyone knew each other's names and the local diner served as the hub of community gossip.

On the roof of his own home, 32-year-old Jaxon Wyatt Thompson wiped the sweat from his forehead with a worn leather glove, surveying the patchwork of shingles that covered his modest two-story bungalow. As a skilled roofer with over five years of experience under his belt, Jaxon took pride in keeping his family's roof secure and well-maintained – a task that had been passed down to him from his father, a veteran roofer himself.

Just as Jaxon was about to finish the final inspection, his phone buzzed on the nearby workbench. He pulled it out, expecting a call from a customer or perhaps a message from his best friend and business partner, Jake – but instead, he saw an unfamiliar number flashing on the screen with a single text message: "Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Come alone."
