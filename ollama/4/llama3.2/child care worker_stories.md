Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the rows of tidy houses on Elm Street. In the heart of this quiet neighborhood, the Brightside Childcare Center bustled with activity as the day drew to a close. Amidst the chaos of toys and snacks, 25-year-old Emily Rose Thompson expertly juggled her duties as lead child's play assistant.

As she helped little Timmy Jenkins with his afternoon snack, Emily's mind began to wander to the peculiar note she'd received earlier that morning from the center's administrator, Mrs. Johnson. The cryptic message had read: "Meet me at the old oak tree in the park at 5 pm. Come alone." A shiver ran down Emily's spine as she made a mental note to ask around discreetly about the mysterious summons.

Outside, children played and laughed while their caregivers worked tirelessly behind the scenes, making sure everyone went home happy and exhausted by bedtime. It was just another day at Brightside Childcare Center, where Emily Rose Thompson had spent countless hours nurturing young minds and watching them grow â€“ but little did she know that tonight would be anything but ordinary.

This story setting establishes a peaceful atmosphere of a small-town childcare center during the end of the day.
