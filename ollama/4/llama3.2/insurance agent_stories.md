Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the small town of Oakdale, Illinois, 32-year-old Ethan Patrick Thompson stepped out of his office building, taking a deep breath of the crisp autumn air. The streets were already emptying, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to find warmth and refuge from the chill that had settled in for the night. Ethan's own office, located on Main Street, was still bathed in the soft glow of its overhead lights, casting a warm ambiance over the space. His assistant, Rachel, had locked up and headed home hours ago, leaving Ethan to his own devices as he prepared to close out the day.

Ethan, an insurance agent with Thompson & Associates, Inc., had spent years building a reputation for being reliable, trustworthy, and – above all – results-driven. He took pride in knowing his clients' families were protected from financial ruin, whether it was through life insurance policies or liability coverage. Tonight, however, Ethan couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.

The phone on his desk had rung once during the day, and when he'd answered, a frantic voice had hung up without speaking a word. Since then, an unsettling sense of unease had settled in the pit of his stomach. He checked the clock: 9:05 PM. Time to head home himself.

Little did Ethan know that this evening would change everything.
