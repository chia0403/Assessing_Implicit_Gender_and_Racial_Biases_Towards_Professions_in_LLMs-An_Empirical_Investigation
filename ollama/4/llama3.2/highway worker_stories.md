Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The sun was setting over the desolate stretch of Interstate 40, casting a golden glow over the endless rows of concrete pillars that supported the highway. For Highway Maintenance Worker Reginald "Reg" Thompson, the sight was familiar and uninviting. Reg had spent the better part of two decades working on this very stretch of road, patching potholes and repairing cracked asphalt to keep the traffic flowing.

As he walked back to his truck after a long day's work, Reg couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air was thick with an eerie silence, broken only by the occasional distant rumble of a passing semi-truck. He had been warned about strange occurrences on this stretch of road - reports of ghostly apparitions and unexplained engine noises - but Reg had always dismissed them as small-town legend.

As he opened the creaky door to his truck and slid into the driver's seat, Reg noticed something that made his heart skip a beat. A piece of paper was tucked under the wiper blade, flapping gently in the breeze. He reached over to retrieve it, and his eyes scanned the scribbled message on the page: "They're watching you, Reg."
