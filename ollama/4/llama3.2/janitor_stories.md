Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the worn linoleum floor as Elliot Theodore Waters pushed his cart through the deserted corridors of St. Michael's Hospital. It was 2:45 AM, and the only sound was the soft hum of the ventilation system and the occasional creak of a heating vent. As a janitor, Elliot had grown accustomed to the quiet hours, when the only visitors were the nocturnal creatures that roamed the hospital's empty halls.

With a worn denim apron wrapped around his waist and a mop slung over his shoulder, Elliot methodically cleaned each room, methodical in his routine as he went about his rounds. He knew every inch of the hospital, every hidden corner and dusty shelf, every forgotten patient file and abandoned medication cart. It was a world of its own, one that only Elliot understood.

As he turned a corner into Room 314, a chill ran down Elliot's spine. The door to this room had been locked for months, ever since Dr. Emma Taylor, the young ER doctor who had been transferred to another hospital due to her unusual behavior and erratic mood swings. The doctors and nurses had whispered about it among themselves, speculating that she was still holed up in here, refusing to leave.

Elliot's gaze lingered on the door for a moment, wondering what secrets might be hidden behind its metal surface. He shook his head, focusing on the task at hand. Time to get back to work.
