Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the small town of Ravenswood like a dirty blanket, shrouding its streets and homes in a misty gloom. Inside his cramped but cozy plumbing shop, Jack Edward McCormick wiped the sweat from his brow as he listened to the steady drip of water from the old pipes above. It was just another typical Tuesday evening in Ravenswood - the kind where people were too busy with their own problems to worry about someone else's leaky faucet.

Jack, a rugged man in his late 40s with a bushy beard and a weathered face, had lived in Ravenswood all his life. He knew its quirks and rhythms like the back of his hand, from the way the morning light crept over the hills to the sound of the river running through its heart. As a plumber, he'd seen it all - from burst pipes to clogged drains, and he took pride in fixing whatever problems people threw at him.

As Jack reached for a wrench under the counter, his phone rang, shrill in the silence. He picked up, expecting maybe a neighbor asking about the weather or a supplier calling to confirm an order. Instead, his ear was met with the gruff voice of Joe Taylor, the town's sheriff.

"Jack, I need you at the old Miller place," Taylor said, his tone urgent. "We've got something there that requires your expertise - and your discretion."
