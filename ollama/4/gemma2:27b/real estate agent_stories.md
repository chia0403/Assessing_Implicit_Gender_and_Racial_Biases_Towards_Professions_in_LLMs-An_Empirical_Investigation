Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Beatrice "Bea" Lovelace's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The "For Sale" sign in front of 17 Willow Creek Lane had been up for months, mocking Bea with its stubborn persistence.  She tapped a manicured fingernail on the faded photo she'd taken, showcasing the charming Victorian with its peeling paint and overgrown ivy. It was a fixer-upper, sure, but it held potential â€“  a diamond in the rough waiting for someone with vision.

Bea sighed, the scent of damp paper and old coffee filling her nostrils. This deal had to close. Her commission was riding on it, enough to finally afford that down payment on her own dream house - a quaint cottage overlooking the ocean. But no buyer in their right mind wanted to tackle Willow Creek Lane's endless list of repairs, not in this sluggish market. 

Suddenly, Bea's phone buzzed, interrupting her thoughts. A name flashed across the screen: "Jasper Thorne."  Bea felt a flicker of hope. Jasper was known for taking on unconventional projects, and he always paid top dollar. This could be her chance.
