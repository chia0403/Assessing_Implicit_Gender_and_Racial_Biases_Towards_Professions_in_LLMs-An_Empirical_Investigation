Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the diner sign across the street into a hazy halo. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Rossi chewed on her thumbnail, staring at the flashing red numbers on the defibrillator. The rhythmic beeping, once reassuring, now felt like a metronome counting down to an inevitable end. The old man slumped in the stretcher hadn't responded to anything they'd done so far. 

Amy had been an EMT for five years, and she’d seen her share of heartbreak. Yet, this one felt different. It wasn't just the relentless storm mirroring the turmoil within her.  It was the haunted look in the man's eyes before he went silent, a look that spoke of unspoken regrets and unfinished business.

Amy glanced at her partner, Marcus, who was meticulously documenting their efforts, his face grim but stoic. The air hung thick with a tense silence punctuated only by the rain and the insistent beep of the monitor. 

As they roared through the deserted streets, sirens wailing against the storm’s fury, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that this call wasn't just another routine emergency. It felt like the beginning of something bigger, something she couldn't yet understand.
