Rain hammered against the stained glass windows of Blackwood Manor, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of the storm. Eleanor Cavendish, her grey bun slightly askew, wrestled with a stubborn stain on the Persian rug in the grand foyer. The manor was a labyrinth of echoing halls and dusty portraits, each one seeming to watch her every move with unnerving intensity. It had been ten years since she'd taken this job, tending to the empty rooms and the lingering memories of a family long gone. 

Today, however, something felt different. A shiver ran down Eleanor's spine, unrelated to the chill seeping through the ancient stone walls. An uneasy anticipation hung in the air, thick as the scent of beeswax polish. It was the kind of feeling that whispered of change, of secrets about to be unearthed.
