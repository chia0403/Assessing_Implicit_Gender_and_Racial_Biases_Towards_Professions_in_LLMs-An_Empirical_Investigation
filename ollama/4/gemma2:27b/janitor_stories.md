The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Astoria Theater cast long, skeletal shadows across the dusty velvet seats. A faint smell of popcorn lingered in the air, a ghost from performances past. Elias Bartholomew, his nametag crooked and stained with what could have been anything, shuffled down the aisle with his ancient mop bucket clanging rhythmically against his knees. The theater was an empty husk tonight, its grandeur muted by the silence, but Elias found a strange comfort in its quietude. 

He'd been the janitor here for almost twenty years, a fixture as much as the ornate cherubs carved into the balcony railings. He knew every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of the wind through the crumbling gargoyles perched on the roof. Elias wasnâ€™t just cleaning; he was keeping the ghosts of the Grand Astoria alive.
