Rain lashed against the window of Beatrice Eloise Winthrop's home office, each drop a tiny hammer blow on her already frayed nerves. Tax season was in full swing, and her inbox overflowed with panicked emails from clients scrambling to gather receipts and decipher cryptic expense reports. Beatrice sighed, pushing a stray curl away from her face. She loved helping people navigate the labyrinthine world of taxes, but this year felt particularly brutal.

The flickering neon sign across the street cast an eerie green glow onto her cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of W-2s, 1099s, and crumpled grocery receipts.  Beatrice took a sip of lukewarm coffee, grimacing at the bitter taste. She longed for the days when her biggest concern was choosing between vanilla and strawberry ice cream, back before life had thrust upon her the mantle of "tax whisperer."

The phone shrilled, jolting Beatrice out of her reverie. It was Mrs. Henderson, a sweet but perpetually disorganized client who always seemed to be missing crucial paperwork.  Beatrice braced herself, already anticipating the frantic pleas and apologies that were sure to follow. As she answered the phone, a sudden gust of wind rattled the windowpane, sending a shiver down her spine. This tax season felt different, charged with an unsettling energy Beatrice couldn't quite explain.
