The wind, smelling faintly of rain and freshly turned earth, whipped across Silas Bartholomew's face as he surveyed his field of barley. It was late June, and the stalks stood tall and thick, their golden heads heavy with promise. The sun beat down on Silas' weathered neck, turning the sweat that beaded there into tiny, sparkling diamonds. He squinted at the horizon, a distant line of dark purple clouds gathering like an angry bruise against the azure sky.

Silas Bartholomew wasn't a man prone to worrying, but those clouds held a familiar threat. Drought had been their unwelcome companion for three summers running, and his family depended on this barley harvest. He needed rain, and he needed it soon. 

The farmhouse, built by his grandfather generations ago, stood at the crest of a gentle hill overlooking the fields. Its white paint was peeling in places, but its sturdy frame held strong against the elements. Smoke curled lazily from the chimney, promising the warmth of home and the comforting smell of his wife Martha's baking bread. 

Silas took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the scent of the earth and the promise of the coming harvest. He had faced hardship before, and he would face it again. This land was in his blood, and he would fight tooth and nail to protect it.
