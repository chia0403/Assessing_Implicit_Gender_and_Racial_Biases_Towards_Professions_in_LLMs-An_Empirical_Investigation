The air in the Grand Blackwood Library hung heavy with the scent of aging paper and beeswax polish. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stillness. Eloise Amelia Finch adjusted her spectacles, her gaze sweeping over the endless rows of towering bookshelves. Each one was crammed with centuries of knowledge, whispered secrets, and forgotten dreams.  

Eloise, a woman who lived and breathed literature, felt most at home amongst these silent guardians of history. She knew each creak of the floorboards, the gentle rustle of turning pages, the soft thud of a book settling back onto its shelf. 


Today, however, something felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, a discordant note amidst the usual tranquil symphony of the library. Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
