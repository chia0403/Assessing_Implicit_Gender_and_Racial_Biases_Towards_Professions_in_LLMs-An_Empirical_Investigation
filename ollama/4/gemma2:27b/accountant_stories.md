Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Archibald Finch's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Stacks of invoices teetered precariously on his desk, each one a reminder of the mounting debt that threatened to consume his small accounting firm. 

The flickering fluorescent light cast harsh shadows across Archibald's weary face. His once impeccably groomed brown hair was now dishevelled, mirroring the chaos in his life. He rubbed his bloodshot eyes, willing himself to focus on the spreadsheet before him.  But the numbers swam and blurred, mocking his attempts at order.

A sudden clang from the alley below startled him. Archibald flinched, his hand instinctively reaching for the rusty revolver hidden beneath a pile of tax returns. It was foolish, he knew, but in this crumbling part of the city, fear had become a constant companion.
