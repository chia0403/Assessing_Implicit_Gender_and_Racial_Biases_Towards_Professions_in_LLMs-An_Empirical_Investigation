The humid air hung heavy over the ancient Mayan ruins of Chichen Itza, thick with the scent of jungle blooms and damp earth. Esmeralda Reyes, her dark hair pulled back in a braid threaded with turquoise beads, squinted at the rising sun. It was already baking the limestone steps leading up to El Castillo, the iconic pyramid that dominated the sprawling complex. Tourists began to trickle in, blinking against the glare and clutching their cameras like precious talismans.

Esmeralda straightened her embroidered blouse, a riot of vibrant colours depicting hummingbirds and flowering vines. Her ancestors had walked these very paths centuries ago, worshipping gods whose names echoed through the carvings on the temple walls. Today, she was their bridge to the past, weaving tales of forgotten empires and sacrificial rituals for wide-eyed visitors from across the globe.
