The acrid smell of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the stale scent of yesterday's takeout noodles. Eliza Jane Hawthorne grimaced, pushing away the lukewarm mug on her cluttered desk. The blinking cursor on her laptop screen mocked her writer's block.

It was 3:02 am, and Eliza had been chasing this story for days. A series of strange disappearances in the sleepy seaside town of Oakhaven â€“ a fisherman vanished from his boat, a young woman disappeared from her apartment without a trace, a dog walker simply...ceased to be, leaving only an empty leash dangling on a park bench. The police were baffled, attributing it all to "isolated incidents," but Eliza smelled something far more sinister lurking beneath the surface.

Outside, the relentless Atlantic pounded against the jagged cliffs overlooking Oakhaven, mirroring the restless churning in Eliza's gut. She needed a breakthrough, a clue, anything to unravel this tangled mystery before another soul vanished into thin air.
