Rain hammered the corrugated iron roof like a thousand frantic fists. Elias Finch, perched precariously on the edge of a three-story Victorian townhouse, cursed under his breath. The wind whipped at his worn canvas jacket, threatening to rip him from his perch and send him tumbling onto the cobblestone street below.

The sky above London was an angry bruise, swallowing the last vestiges of daylight. Elias squinted through the downpour, trying to gauge the distance to the chimney he needed to repair. He'd been called out on a Sunday – emergency job, the homeowner had pleaded – and while Elias appreciated the overtime, he wouldn't mind being tucked away in his warm flat with a mug of tea right about now.

The smell of damp brick and wet tar hung heavy in the air.  Elias tightened his grip on the rusty scaffolding ladder, feeling the familiar ache in his shoulders and the sting of rain biting at his face. He was a man carved from granite, weathered by years spent battling the elements atop London's rooftops. 

This wasn't just any job though. This townhouse perched on the edge of Bloomsbury held a peculiar allure for Elias. He'd glimpsed the antique roses struggling to bloom in the overgrown garden below, and the faint glow of lamplight emanating from a window on the top floor promised a story waiting to be unfolded.
