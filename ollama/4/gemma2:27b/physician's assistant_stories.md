Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to chew on.  Inside the makeshift clinic, a single flickering bulb cast long shadows across the dirt floor, illuminating the worried faces gathered around Elara Esperanza.

Elara, her dark hair pulled back tight, her brow furrowed in concentration, examined the feverish child lying on a worn cot. His chest heaved with each shallow breath, his tiny hand clutching at his mother's rough cotton dress. The clinic was little more than a dilapidated hut perched precariously on the edge of a sprawling refugee camp.  

Beyond the thin canvas walls, Elara could hear the constant thrum of life â€“ children playing amongst the tents, women gossiping over shared pots of stew, men huddled around crackling fires discussing the latest news from their war-torn homeland. The camp was a microcosm of humanity, teeming with hope and despair in equal measure.

Elara Esperanza, a physician's assistant who had traded her comfortable life in Boston for this chaotic, humbling world, felt the weight of responsibility settle heavily on her shoulders.  She knew that her skills were desperately needed here, but sometimes she wondered if it was enough.
