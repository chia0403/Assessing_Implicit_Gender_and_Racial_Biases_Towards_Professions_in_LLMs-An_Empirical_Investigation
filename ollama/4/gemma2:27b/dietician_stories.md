The aroma of turmeric and ginger hung heavy in the air, battling with the sterile scent of disinfectant that always permeated the community clinic. Elara Finch adjusted her stethoscope, frowning at the stubborn stain on her white coat â€“ a testament to her last patient's rather enthusiastic curry habit.

Today was supposed to be the day she finally convinced Mrs. Gupta to switch from ghee-laden samosas to healthier baked snacks. A task that felt about as achievable as teaching a mango tree to grow apples.
