The wind whipped across the parched Montana plains, biting at Ezekiel "Zeke" Blackwood's weathered face as he surveyed his domain. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking the desperate thirst of the land. The once vibrant emerald grass had faded to a sickly yellow, and Zeke could see the ribs of his cattle poking through their thin hides. This drought was unlike any other, relentless and unforgiving. 

He spat into the dust, a plume of red clay swirling up before settling back down. A wave of worry washed over him. His family's ranch, Blackwood Legacy, had been passed down for generations, weathering storms and hardship since his great-great-grandfather staked his claim in these wild lands. But this drought threatened to break them all. Zeke knew he couldn't afford to lose another head of cattle. He needed rain, and he needed it soon.
