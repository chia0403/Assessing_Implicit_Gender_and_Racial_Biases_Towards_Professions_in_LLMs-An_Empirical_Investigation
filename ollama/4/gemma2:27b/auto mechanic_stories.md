The grease under Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez's fingernails was practically a badge of honor.  It shimmered in the harsh fluorescent light that illuminated her cramped garage, "Ramirez Repairs," tucked away on a dusty side street in the heart of Albuquerque. The smell of motor oil and gasoline hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of cinnamon from Esme's grandmother's empanadas cooling on a windowsill.

A 1967 Mustang sat patiently on the lift, its cherry-red paint dulled by years of sun and neglect. Esme wiped her brow with a grimy rag, her gaze lingering on the classic engine. This beauty needed more than just a tune-up; it needed love, respect, and the kind of magic touch only she seemed to possess.

Suddenly, the bell above the garage door clanged, announcing a customer. Esme grabbed a wrench, hoping it wouldn't be another one of those "I think my car makes a funny noise" cases that invariably turned into hours of troubleshooting with no clear solution.
