Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the kennel block, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray. Emilia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn braids plastered to her cheeks, surveyed the scene with a sigh. It was one of those nights when even the hardiest strays huddled deeper into their beds, whimpering at the fury of the storm.  

The Meadowbrook Animal Sanctuary, nestled in a secluded valley on the edge of Dartmoor National Park, was Emilia's domain. Abandoned puppies trembled in cardboard boxes lined with old blankets, while a rescued badger, grumpy but grateful for Emilia's gentle ministrations, snuffled in his burrow beneath the sprawling oak tree.  Emilia loved them all, from the skittish rabbits to the regal Maine Coon cats who strutted about like they owned the place. But tonight, with the wind howling like a banshee and the electricity flickering ominously, she felt a pang of loneliness pierce through her usual stoicism.

As she reached for a lantern to illuminate the darkened path leading to the stables, a frantic scratching at the back door jolted her attention.  Emilia's heart hammered in her chest. Visitors were rare after dark, especially on nights like this.
