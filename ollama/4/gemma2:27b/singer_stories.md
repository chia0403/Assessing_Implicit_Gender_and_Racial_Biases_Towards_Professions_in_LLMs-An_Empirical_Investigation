The air hung thick with humidity, carrying the scent of jasmine and woodsmoke from the open-air market stalls that lined Rue de la Fontaine. It was Bastille Day in Montmartre, Paris, and the cobblestone streets thrummed with life - accordion melodies weaving through boisterous laughter, the clatter of glasses, and the rhythmic pulse of a distant drum circle. 

Amidst the revelry, tucked away in a dimly lit cafe called "Le Chat Noir," sat Celeste Delacroix. Her fingers traced nervous patterns on the worn wooden tabletop as she waited. Tonight was her first performance at this legendary venue, a stage graced by countless musical icons before her.  Her heart pounded against her ribs like a frantic hummingbird. This wasn't just any gig; it could be the break she’d been waiting for, the chance to share her music with a wider audience and finally step out from the shadows of anonymity. 


Celeste took a deep breath, willing herself to calm down. Her voice, rich and textured like dark chocolate, was her greatest asset – a gift honed through years of singing in smoky bars and intimate cafes.  Tonight, she'd pour her soul into every note, hoping it would resonate with the expectant crowd.
