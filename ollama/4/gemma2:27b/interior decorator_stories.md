Rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Eliza Kensington's studio apartment, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist painting of shimmering lights and muted greys. The relentless drumming mirrored the anxiety that thrummed in her chest. Today was the deadline for the Hawthorne Manor proposal, a project she’d poured her heart and soul into.

Eliza traced the lines of her intricate sketches, each meticulously detailed with fabric swatches and paint samples. The manor, a crumbling Victorian mansion on the outskirts of town, was begging for revival, its faded grandeur whispering promises of elegance and history. She’d envisioned restoring it to its former glory, weaving modern comfort into its antique bones while preserving its unique character.

But would the Hawthorne family see her vision? Would they trust her with their ancestral home? Eliza's phone vibrated, pulling her from her anxious reverie. It was a text from Mr. Hawthorne, requesting a meeting at the manor that afternoon. A surge of adrenaline coursed through her. This was it, her chance to breathe life back into Hawthorne Manor and, perhaps, finally prove herself worthy of the dreams she held close.
