The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the stainless steel instruments laid out before Dr. Evelyn Moreau like offerings to a god. She ran a gloved finger along the edge of a scalpel, testing its sharpness. The cool metal brought a sense of familiarity, grounding her in this chaotic world she inhabited. Outside the operating room window, the Seattle skyline glittered under a waning moon, oblivious to the life-or-death drama unfolding within.

Evelyn took a deep breath, trying to quell the nervous flutter in her chest. This wasn't just any surgery. It was a triple bypass on Mayor Thornton, the city's beloved figurehead who'd suffered a massive heart attack earlier that evening. The weight of expectation pressed down on her, heavy and suffocating. 


Her team assembled around the table â€“ nurses checking vitals, anesthesiologist prepping the patient. Evelyn felt their eyes on her, waiting for her to lead them through this intricate dance with death. Her hand tightened on the scalpel. Tonight, she wasn't just a surgeon; she was a guardian angel, entrusted with the life of a man who held Seattle in his hands.
