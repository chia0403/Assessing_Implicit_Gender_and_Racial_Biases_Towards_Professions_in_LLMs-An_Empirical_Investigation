The acrid smell of ozone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Silas Hawthorne, Master Electrician. He knelt beneath the flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned textile mill, his forehead beaded with sweat despite the chill that permeated the cavernous space. Rusted looms stood sentinel amongst tangled spools of thread, their silent majesty a stark contrast to the rhythmic hum of Silas's testing equipment. 

A shiver ran down his spine, unbidden and unexplained. This place held a peculiar energy, something beyond the usual electromagnetic hum he expected in decaying industrial structures. He glanced towards the darkened windows, high above the concrete floor, where shadows danced with the flickering light. It was then he heard it - a faint whisper, like static on a radio, barely audible over the drone of his testing equipment.

Silas straightened, his heart thudding against his ribs. "Just the wind," he muttered to himself, but the hairs on the back of his neck remained raised. The whisper came again, this time clearer, tinged with a mournful melody that seemed to seep into his bones. He knew then, with a certainty that defied logic, that this was no ordinary job.
