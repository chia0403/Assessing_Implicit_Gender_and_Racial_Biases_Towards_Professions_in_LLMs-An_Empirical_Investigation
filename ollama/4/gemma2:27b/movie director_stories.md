Elias Thorne, a man whose face bore more wrinkles than his thirty-eight years should allow, squinted up at them. The flickering light mirrored the chaos brewing inside him.

Elias wasn't meant for Bangkok. He was a creature of Hollywood hills and soundstages â€“ a meticulous auteur who prided himself on crafting stories with the precision of a surgeon.
