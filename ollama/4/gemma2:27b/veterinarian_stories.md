Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Carmichael's mobile clinic, mimicking the frantic hammering in her chest. Her headlights cut weakly through the sheets of water, illuminating a mud-slicked dirt track leading to an ancient barn nestled on the edge of a windswept moor. It was far from ideal conditions for a house call, especially when the patient was a newborn foal struggling to survive. 

Eve gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. This was why she'd chosen this life - the urgency, the unpredictability, the chance to make a difference in the lives of creatures who couldn't speak for themselves. But tonight, doubt gnawed at her. The storm felt like an omen, and the silence from the farmer on the other end of the phone had been unnerving.
