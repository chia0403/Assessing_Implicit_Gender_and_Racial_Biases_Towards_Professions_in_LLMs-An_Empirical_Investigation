Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Peterson's Dental Practice, blurring the already dreary view of Elm Street. Inside, Amelia Blackwood adjusted her headlamp, its bright beam illuminating the cavernous maw of Mrs. Higgins, a formidable woman whose teeth seemed to have their own gravitational pull.

Amelia loved this part of her job â€“ the meticulous detail work, the tangible satisfaction of revealing gleaming surfaces beneath years of accumulated grime. It was almost meditative.
