Rain lashed against the glass doors of The Obsidian Building, blurring the neon sign that proclaimed "Luxe Living Apartments" in shimmering purple letters. Eleanor Beatrice Finch sighed, pushing a stray curl back into her bun with a weary hand. Five minutes past eight and already she felt like she'd been fielding complaints for hours. 

The lobby was an oasis of calm amidst the storm raging outside. Polished marble floors gleamed under soft spotlights, expensive potted palms swayed gently in corners, and the air hummed with the low thrum of a hidden water feature. Yet, none of it could soothe Eleanor's mounting frustration.  She longed for the days when her job simply involved answering phones and directing visitors. Now, thanks to budget cuts and a disappearing building manager, she was expected to handle everything from plumbing emergencies to tenant disputes.

A shrill ringing pierced the air, jolting Eleanor back to reality. It was the phone on her desk, probably another irate resident complaining about a leaky faucet or a malfunctioning elevator.  As she reached for the receiver, a figure emerged from the shadows cast by the towering ferns flanking the entrance. Tall and shrouded in a long, dark coat, the stranger stood silently, watching Eleanor with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through her.
