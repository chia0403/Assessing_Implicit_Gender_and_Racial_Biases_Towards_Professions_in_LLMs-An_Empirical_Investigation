Rain lashed against the attic window, a relentless drumming that mirrored the turmoil in Eloise Beaumont's chest. Her studio, nestled under the eaves of her grandmother's rambling Victorian house, felt suffocatingly small. Canvases leaned against the walls, splashed with vibrant colours and unfinished dreams.  Each one stared back at her, accusingly silent, a testament to her creative block. 

Eloise ran a hand through her tangled auburn hair, frustration twisting in her gut. It had been weeks since inspiration had graced her brush. The once-flowing ideas, the whispers of colour and form that usually filled her mind, were gone, replaced by a bone-deep stillness. She longed to recapture the joy she felt when paint flowed onto canvas, transforming blankness into something beautiful, something real.

But today, even the scent of turpentine couldn't ignite a spark. The grey sky outside mirrored her mood, and the wind howled like a mournful beast. Eloise sank onto the worn wooden stool by her easel, the familiar creak a lonely sound in the otherwise silent attic. She knew she needed a change, something to shake her out of this creative rut.  But what?
