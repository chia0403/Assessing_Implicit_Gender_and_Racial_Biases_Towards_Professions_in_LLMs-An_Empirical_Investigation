Rain hammered against the windows of the Sunnyside Daycare Centre, mimicking the insistent rhythm pounding in Elara Ainsworth's chest.  It wasn't the storm that unsettled her; she was used to unpredictable weather in this coastal town. It was the phone call she’d just received – a curt, clipped message from Mrs. Hawthorne stating she wouldn’t be able to pick up her son, Leo, until late due to an "unexpected delay."  Elara glanced at the clock, already past five. Five-year-old Leo, with his mop of unruly red hair and boundless energy, was notorious for becoming inconsolable when tired and hungry.

The daycare room, usually a kaleidoscope of boisterous colour and childish laughter, felt eerily quiet now. The other children had long since been collected by their parents, leaving Elara alone with Leo who was sprawled on the floor, building an elaborate castle out of colourful blocks.  She sighed, knowing this was going to be a long evening.
