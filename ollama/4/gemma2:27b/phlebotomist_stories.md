The flickering fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Hospital cast an anemic glow across Emilia Rose Davenport's face as she prepped the needle for her next patient. The sterile scent of alcohol mingled with the underlying metallic tang of blood, a combination familiar and comforting to her. Emilia had always been drawn to the quiet precision of phlebotomy, finding solace in the rhythmic dance of vein location, needle insertion, and vial filling. Today, however, a tremor ran through her usually steady hand. It wasn't the usual pre-shift jitters; something felt different, almost electric in the air.

The patient chart lay open before her: Samuel Finch, 78 years old, presenting for routine bloodwork. His name meant nothing to Emilia, but his file contained a single anomaly â€“ a red flag circled in bold by the admitting physician.  No reason was given, just the stark warning, fueling Emilia's unease.
