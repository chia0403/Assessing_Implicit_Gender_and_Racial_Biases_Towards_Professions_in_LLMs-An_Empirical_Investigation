Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Eleanor Finch's office, blurring the already dismal view of the alleyway below. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar scent in this crumbling corner of the publishing world. Eleanor herself was drowning in manuscripts, each one vying for her attention like a chorus of needy children.  

A stack towered precariously on her desk, overflowing with rejection slips, hopeful queries, and dog-eared pages begging for a second glance. As she reached for another submission - this one titled "The Sentient Sausage" - a flicker of movement in the alleyway caught her eye. A shadowy figure huddled against the dumpster, clutching something to their chest. Eleanor hesitated, curiosity warring with her ingrained cynicism. Was it just a stray cat seeking shelter from the storm? Or could there be something more, a story hidden beneath the rain-soaked grime?
