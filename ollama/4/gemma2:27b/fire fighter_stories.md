Smoke curled like a vengeful spirit from the top floor windows of the abandoned textile mill.  Flames danced against the bruised twilight sky, painting the crumbling brick facade in flickering shades of orange and crimson.

Eli took a deep breath, forcing himself to ignore the gnawing unease in his gut. "Let's go get 'em," he said, his voice gruff but determined. The siren wailed, piercing the night, as Eli and his team charged towards the inferno, their faces illuminated by the flashing red and blue lights.
