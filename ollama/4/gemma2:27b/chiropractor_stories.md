Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Finch's office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart. It was barely past six in the evening, and the storm showed no sign of abating, mirroring the unease that had settled over Eleanor since receiving the cryptic message.  

Her practice, nestled on a quiet side street in bustling Savannah, Georgia, normally hummed with the comforting clicks and pops of adjustments. But tonight, the only sound was the relentless drumming of rain and the faint ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner. The message, scrawled on a faded postcard and slipped under her door that afternoon, simply read: "Magnolia Cemetery, midnight." No signature. No explanation. Just an address and a time.

Eleanor traced the worn spine of a chiropractic textbook with trembling fingers, her mind racing. Magnolia Cemetery, a place steeped in Savannah's history and shrouded in tales of hauntings, felt decidedly out of place for her world of skeletal alignments and muscle tension relief. But something about the message tugged at her, a subtle thread of familiarity interwoven with an unsettling sense of foreboding.
