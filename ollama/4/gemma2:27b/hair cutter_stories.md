The humid New Orleans air hung heavy, thick with the scent of beignets and chicory coffee. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of "Curl Up & Dye," casting stripes across the worn checkerboard floor. Eloise Bernadette Dupree, her fingers stained crimson from the latest fiery ombr√© she'd crafted, sighed contentedly. She loved this time of day, when the afternoon rush had subsided and only the gentle whir of ceiling fans punctuated the quiet. Eloise surveyed her domain: vintage barber chairs upholstered in faded velvet, walls adorned with framed photographs of iconic hairstyles (think Grace Kelly's chignon and David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust red mullet), and shelves overflowing with bottles of potion-like hair treatments. 


Today, however, a strange stillness pervaded the air. No one had walked through the door since noon, and even the usual clatter from the cafe next door seemed muted. Eloise frowned, picking up a stray curl from the floor. Something felt...off.
