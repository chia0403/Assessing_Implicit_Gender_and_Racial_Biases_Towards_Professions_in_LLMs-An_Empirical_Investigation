Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Dr. Elias Finch's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee, a familiar comfort in this forgotten corner of London's East End. His desk, cluttered with stacks of files and worn medical textbooks, seemed to groan under the weight of his responsibilities. 

Elias ran a hand through his thinning hair, exhaustion etching lines around his tired blue eyes. He was the only doctor left in Whitechapel, tending to the city's forgotten souls â€“ the factory workers coughing up coal dust, the children riddled with consumption, the mothers losing their babies to unseen enemies. He felt like he was bailing out a sinking ship with a teaspoon, fighting a losing battle against poverty and disease.

Tonight, however, the storm raged on a different front. A frantic knock at the door sent Elias jolting upright, his heart pounding in his chest. A messenger stood drenched on his doorstep, clutching a crumpled note. "Doctor Finch," he gasped, "It's urgent.  A young woman... she's been found..."

Elias's gut clenched. He knew what that meant. Another victim of the terror stalking their streets.  He grabbed his worn leather bag and followed the messenger into the night, the rain blurring the cobblestone streets and the gaslights flickering like dying embers.
