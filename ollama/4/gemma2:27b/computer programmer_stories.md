Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thorne's cramped apartment, blurring the neon glow of Tokyo's Shinjuku district into an impressionistic mess. Elias, hunched over his keyboard like a gargoyle perched on a crumbling cathedral, barely noticed. His world was confined to the flickering screen before him, lines of code scrolling past like cryptic hieroglyphs. He was neck-deep in debugging a particularly stubborn algorithm for a new augmented reality app, his fingers dancing across the keys with practiced precision.

The humid air hung thick with the smell of instant ramen and stale coffee. Empty energy drink cans littered the desk beside stacks of dusty programming manuals. Elias hadn't slept properly in days, fueled by caffeine and sheer willpower. This project was crucial - a chance to prove himself after years of struggling as a freelance programmer.  

Suddenly, his screen flickered, and a string of unfamiliar characters appeared. Elias squinted, confused. He’d never seen anything like it before. This wasn't part of his code. Was it some kind of glitch? Or something… else?
