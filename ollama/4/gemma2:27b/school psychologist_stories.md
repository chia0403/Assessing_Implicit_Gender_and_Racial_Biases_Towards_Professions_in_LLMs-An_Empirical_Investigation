The fluorescent lights hummed incessantly above Dr. Eleanor Vance's head, casting a sterile glow over her cluttered desk. A half-eaten bagel sat precariously on a stack of student files, its cream cheese beginning to dry and flake. Outside the window, a storm brewed, wind whipping against the glass panes like angry fists. It mirrored the turmoil brewing inside Eleanor. 

Willow Creek High School was notorious for its tight-knit community and idyllic charm, but beneath the surface simmered anxieties Eleanor knew all too well. Today's case – a withdrawn freshman named Liam Blackwood – felt different. His file was thick with teacher notes detailing erratic behavior, sudden bursts of anger, and unsettling drawings filled with macabre imagery. As Eleanor reread Liam's latest outburst in art class, where he'd reportedly declared himself "the harbinger of darkness," a shiver snaked down her spine. This wasn't just teenage angst; something deeper, more sinister, seemed to be at play.
