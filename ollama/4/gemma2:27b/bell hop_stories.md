The brass bell gleamed under the harsh fluorescent light of the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby, its polished surface reflecting Elias Finch's tired face. Another late check-in meant another round of hauling oversized suitcases up to some anonymous room on one of the higher floors.

Elias sighed, hefting the heavy bag with a grunt. The couple who'd just arrived were already arguing in hushed tones, their voices clipped and tense. They reminded him of his own parents, always sniping at each other like irritable sparrows. He longed for the day he could afford to leave this gilded cage, escape the endless cycle of bellhops, porters, and room service waiters that seemed to be the only life available to him.

Tonight, though, something felt different. The air hung heavy with an unusual stillness, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock near the entrance. Even the chattering guests seemed subdued, their eyes darting nervously towards the ornate double doors leading out onto Blackwood Avenue.

As Elias pushed through the revolving door into the night, he couldn't shake the feeling that something big was about to happen. The city lights shimmered with an eerie glow, and a chill wind whispered down the cobblestone street, carrying with it the faint scent of rain and something else...something metallic.
