The rain hammered against the frosted glass of Amelia Cavendish's office window, mimicking the insistent thrumming in her chest. The city lights below blurred into an impressionist painting, streaks of gold and crimson bleeding through the incessant grey. It was the kind of night that made even the most hardened soul crave a fire and a hot cup of tea. Amelia, however, craved justice.

Justice for her client, Daniel Hayes, whose world had crumbled around him when his tech startup was accused of stealing proprietary software. A young, ambitious man on the cusp of greatness, Daniel now faced accusations that could ruin him, both professionally and personally.  Amelia stared at the file open on her desk, the weight of Daniel's future pressing down on her. She knew the case wouldn't be easy. The opposing counsel was a shark, known for his ruthlessness and penchant for winning at any cost. 

But Amelia Cavendish wasn't afraid of a fight. She had built her reputation on defending the underdog, those who couldn't afford the best legal representation but deserved it nonetheless. Daniel Hayes was one such case. And she wouldn't let him down.
