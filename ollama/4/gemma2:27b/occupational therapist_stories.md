Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already bleak cityscape beyond.  A low rumble of thunder echoed through the aging building, sending a shiver down the spine of Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright, OT.

Eleanor sighed, her gaze drifting over the empty therapy room. Usually buzzing with activity at this hour, it lay silent, chairs pushed haphazardly against the walls, forgotten exercise balls scattered like oversized marbles across the floor.  Today was different. The annual St. Jude's Carnival had been canceled due to the torrential downpour, leaving Eleanor and her patients adrift in a sea of unfulfilled expectations and stifled energy.

Eleanor straightened the stack of brightly colored therapy putty on her desk, trying to inject some cheer into the gloomy space.  She was determined to make the best of this unexpected lull, even if it meant improvising. After all, Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright never backed down from a challenge.
