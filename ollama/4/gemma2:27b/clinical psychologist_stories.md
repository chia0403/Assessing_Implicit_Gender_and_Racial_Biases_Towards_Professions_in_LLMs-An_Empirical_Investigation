Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the cityscape outside into an impressionistic watercolor of grey and gold. The rhythmic drumming seemed to mirror the anxiety thrumming beneath Eleanor's skin. She stared at the manila folder on her desk, the name embossed in bold black letters: "Samuel Hayes." It wasn't the unusual surname that bothered her; it was the file itself, unusually thin for a referral from St. Jude's Psychiatric Hospital. 

Eleanor's office, tucked away on the third floor of a stately brownstone in Boston's Back Bay, was usually a sanctuary of calm – plush armchairs, warm lamplight, and shelves overflowing with well-worn psychology texts. But today, the air felt heavy with unspoken tension. Eleanor straightened her cardigan, took a deep breath, and opened the file.

Inside were only two pages: Samuel Hayes's admission notes from St. Jude's, detailing bizarre hallucinations and paranoid delusions, followed by a single, terse recommendation: "Consult Dr. Vance for further evaluation." There was no mention of his background, occupation, or family history - nothing to anchor this enigmatic patient in the world Eleanor knew. A shiver ran down her spine. This Samuel Hayes was a puzzle she couldn't wait – and yet dreaded – to solve.
