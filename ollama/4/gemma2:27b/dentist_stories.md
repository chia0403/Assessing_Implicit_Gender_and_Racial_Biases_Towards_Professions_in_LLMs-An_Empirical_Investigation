The midday sun beat down on the dusty windows of Dr. Alistair Finch's dental practice. Nestled on a quiet side street in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, the building was as weathered and charming as its owner. Inside, however, the air hummed with the sterile scent of antiseptic and the whirring of drills â€“ a symphony of discomfort familiar to Dr. Finch's patients. Today, though, something felt off.

The usual trickle of anxious faces had slowed to a drip. Alistair tapped his pen against the appointment schedule, the silence broken only by the ticking clock on the wall. He glanced out the window at the bustling town square, unusually deserted for this time of day.  A shiver ran down his spine, an unsettling premonition settling in his gut.  Something was amiss in Oakhaven, and Alistair Finch knew it.
