Rain lashed against the windowpane of Theodore Alistair Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of "Finch & Sons Insurance" across the street. Theo sighed, tapping his pen against a stack of claims that seemed to grow taller by the minute.  He hated days like this - grey, dreary, and filled with the scent of damp wool from his trench coat. The air hung thick with a melancholic symphony played by the wind howling down Elm Street and the distant rumble of thunder. 

Theo wasn't sure what was worse: the tedious paperwork or the unsettling feeling that something was about to go terribly wrong. It was an intuition he couldn't quite place, but it sat in his gut like a lead weight, making him restless and anxious. He glanced at the antique clock on the wall, its hands inching closer to five o'clock.  He just wanted to get home, make some tea, and disappear into a good book.


But fate, as it often did, had other plans for Theodore Alistair Finch.
