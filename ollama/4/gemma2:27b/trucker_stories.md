The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the weary pines lining Interstate 80.  A symphony of crickets chirped their nightly chorus, punctuated by the rhythmic thrumming of Silas Blackwood's eighteen-wheeler. He was hauling a load of Idaho potatoes eastbound, destined for a supermarket chain somewhere in Ohio.

Silas drummed his fingers on the steering wheel, squinting at the fading light. It had been a long day, and his eyelids felt heavy as sacks of grain. He craved nothing more than a hot shower and a decent meal – preferably one that didn't come from a gas station microwave. 

He reached for his thermos, taking a swig of lukewarm coffee. The bitter liquid barely registered on his palate, but it was enough to keep him alert. As he scanned the desolate highway ahead, a flicker of movement caught his eye in the rearview mirror. A motorcycle, its headlight like a lone predator's eye, was rapidly gaining on him.  

Silas frowned. He wasn’t fond of being tailgated, especially not at night on a deserted stretch of road. He glanced down at his speedometer, wondering if he should pull over and let the rider pass.
