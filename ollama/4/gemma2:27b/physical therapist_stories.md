Rain hammered against the windowpane, mimicking the insistent throbbing in Elara Montgomery's temples. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, adding to the dull ache settling into her bones. It was always like this on Mondays - the weight of the week pressing down before it even began.

Elara sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her face as she surveyed the small, cluttered office. Posters depicting anatomical diagrams and motivational slogans plastered the walls, clashing with the worn-out furniture and stacks of patient files threatening to spill onto the floor. This wasn't exactly the sleek, modern clinic she'd envisioned when she graduated top of her class, but it was hers.

A hesitant knock startled her from her reverie. "Come in," Elara called out, straightening her posture and smoothing down her already-wrinkled lab coat. The door creaked open, revealing a young man with apprehensive eyes and a cast encasing his right arm.  He shuffled awkwardly into the room, wincing with every step. This was it, then. Time to get started.
