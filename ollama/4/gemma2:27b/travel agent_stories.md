Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Wanderlust Escapes," blurring the twinkling lights strung across the Parisian cityscape poster.  Inside, Esmeralda Thorne adjusted her spectacles, peering at the screen with furrowed brows. The email from Madame Dubois, a notoriously demanding client, glowed ominously. "Esmeralda," it read, "My annual trip to the Maldives has been thrown into disarray by this...weather anomaly."

Esmeralda sighed. Madame Dubois had booked a luxurious overwater bungalow for next week, and the recent El Niño cycle was threatening to unleash unprecedented monsoon rains on the tropical paradise. Esmeralda, her heart heavy with the weight of dashed dreams, knew she had a monumental task ahead: finding a suitable replacement for Madame Dubois's idyllic getaway.

The bell above the door jingled, breaking through her concentration. A young woman with bright eyes and a backpack slung over her shoulder stood hesitantly in the doorway.  A shiver ran down Esmeralda's spine – this, she felt, was no ordinary traveler.
