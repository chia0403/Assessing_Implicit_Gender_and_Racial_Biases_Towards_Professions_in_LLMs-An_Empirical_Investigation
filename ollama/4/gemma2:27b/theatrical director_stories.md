The acrid scent of burnt coffee beans and desperation clung to Elias Beaumont like an ill-fitting costume. He paced the cramped wings backstage, his footsteps echoing off the worn velvet curtains and dusty flats. The Grand Blackwood Theatre, once a jewel box of Victorian elegance, now wheezed with age, its faded grandeur mirroring Elias's own dwindling hope. His latest production, a daring reimagining of "Macbeth" set in a dystopian future city, was teetering on the precipice of disaster. 

Opening night loomed just two days away, and half the cast was down with a particularly nasty strain of flu.  The lead actress playing Lady Macbeth had stormed off in a huff after an explosive argument about the interpretation of her character, leaving Elias to grapple with finding a replacement before the curtain rose on their fragile dreams. 


He paused, his hand hovering over a chipped paintbrush resting against a makeshift prop sword. He needed a miracle.  But miracles were for fairy tales, not for struggling directors in crumbling theaters. Or so he thought, until a voice as clear and sharp as shattered glass sliced through the air.

"I believe I can help you with your Macbeth problem, Mr. Beaumont."
