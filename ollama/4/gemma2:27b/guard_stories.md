Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Fort Obsidian's watchtower, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray. The wind howled like a tormented beast, rattling the ancient timbers of the fortress and whipping Elara Blackwoodâ€™s cloak around her legs. She tightened her grip on her spear, its rough wooden shaft cold beneath her calloused fingers.

Fort Obsidian loomed above the desolate moorland, a hulking silhouette against the storm-wracked sky. Its black stones, once polished to a gleaming sheen, were now weathered and moss-covered, testament to centuries of relentless wind and rain. Below, the swirling mists obscured the ancient path that snaked up the mountainside, rendering the fortress seemingly isolated from the world. 


Elara scanned the horizon, her gaze piercing through the curtain of rain. Her duty was vigilance, a responsibility she took seriously. The fort held secrets - whispers of forgotten magic and powerful artifacts rumored to lie dormant within its depths. Secrets that some would kill for. And tonight, with the storm raging around them, Fort Obsidian felt especially vulnerable.
