The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne’s back as he swung his hammer, chipping away at the rough granite. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh light filtering through the open mouth of the cave workshop. Elias, his brow slick with sweat, grunted with each blow, shaping the stone into a graceful archway for the new cathedral being built in the city below. The clang of hammer against chisel echoed off the cavern walls, a rhythmic counterpoint to the gurgling stream that trickled through the heart of the mountain.

Elias wasn't just any stone cutter; he was renowned throughout the region for his skill and artistry. His hands, calloused and strong, could coax life out of inert rock, transforming it into objects of both beauty and utility. But today, a sense of unease gnawed at him. He’d been plagued by strange dreams lately - visions of swirling shadows and whispers carried on the wind, premonitions that left him feeling unsettled.

And then there was the stone itself. This particular block felt…different. It vibrated faintly beneath his chisel, humming with an unseen energy that sent shivers down his spine. As he worked, he couldn't shake the feeling that something ancient and powerful lay hidden within its depths, waiting to be unleashed.
