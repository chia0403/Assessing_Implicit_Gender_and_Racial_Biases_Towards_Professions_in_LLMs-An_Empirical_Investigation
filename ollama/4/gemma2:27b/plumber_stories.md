The stench hit Elara Finch before the sound did. It was a thick, syrupy smell, like overripe fruit rotting in stagnant water. A shiver ran down her spine, despite the sweltering July heat clinging to New Orleans' air. This wasn't your typical clogged toilet or leaky faucet.

Elara knelt beside the manhole cover, its rusted edges groaning under her weight as she pried it open. The maw of the sewer gaped before her, an abyss shrouded in a sickly green mist. It pulsed with a low hum, a guttural throb that vibrated through Elara's bones.  

This wasn't her usual gig â€“ fixing burst pipes for Creole grannies or unclogging greasy drains in dingy dive bars. This was something else entirely, a request from a shadowy figure who called himself "The Collector" and promised enough money to finally fix the leaky roof over her grandmother's head.
