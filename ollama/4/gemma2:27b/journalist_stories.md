Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's cramped apartment. The neon glow from a nearby ramen shop cast an sickly yellow hue onto her cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of half-written articles and crumpled coffee cups.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation. Amy, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, chewed on the end of her pen, her brow furrowed as she stared at the blank screen.

She was three days past deadline on her exposé about corruption within the city council – an exposé that could make or break her career. But her source, a jittery young intern named Leo, had gone missing, leaving Amy with nothing but cryptic notes and a growing sense of unease. The silence from Leo was deafening, punctuated only by the incessant drumming of the rain.

The story wasn't just about power and politics anymore; it was about finding Leo, and uncovering the truth behind his disappearance.  A shiver ran down Amy's spine. This city, always shrouded in a perpetual twilight, seemed to be closing in on her.
