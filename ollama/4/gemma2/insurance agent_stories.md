The humid Georgia air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Pendleton like a second skin as he navigated his beat-up Ford Focus through the sprawling suburban sprawl of Marietta. The asphalt shimmered in the afternoon sun, and cicadas buzzed their incessant symphony from the overgrown oaks lining the streets.  

Bart squinted at his phone, trying to decipher the address scrawled across the screen. He was late, again. Mrs. Evelyn Harper's claim for a "Mysterious Mold Incident" was already on the back burner, simmering with frustration. The fact that she had called him “darling” when demanding an immediate visit hadn’t helped his irritation. 

He pulled up to a modest brick ranch with peeling paint and a swing set swaying gently in the breeze. A rusty "Beware of Dog" sign hung crookedly on the front porch, its warning undermined by a plump beagle snoozing peacefully under the shade of a magnolia tree.  


This wasn't Bart's dream job – he’d envisioned himself scaling corporate ladders and negotiating million-dollar deals – but somehow, here he was, a thirty-year-old insurance agent navigating the surreal world of claims involving everything from exploding toasters to phantom squirrels stealing garden gnomes. But today, with Mrs. Harper and her "Mysterious Mold Incident," something felt different. Bart could feel it in his gut; this case was about to get weird.
