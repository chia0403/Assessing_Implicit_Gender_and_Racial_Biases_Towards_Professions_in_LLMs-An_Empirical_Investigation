The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Thornton's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the linoleum floor of the "Dollar Delights" discount store.  She sighed, her breath catching in the stale air thick with the scent of discounted air fresheners and artificial strawberry candy. Five minutes until her shift ended, five minutes until she could escape this purgatory of bargain bins and bored shoppers. 

A bell jingled as another customer entered, a weary-looking woman pushing a cart overflowing with half-price cereal boxes and plastic tubs of questionable condiments. Amelia plastered on a smile that felt more like a grimace.


This was her life: scanning groceries, bagging pretzels, and enduring the endless barrage of mundane conversations from people who clearly had nothing better to do with their time. A life as predictable as the coupons she scanned, as monotonous as the rhythmic beep of the cash register.   But tonight, something felt different. Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that this ordinary night was about to become anything but.
