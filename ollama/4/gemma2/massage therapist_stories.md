The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea brewing on the counter.

Amelia Rose Hawthorne meticulously arranged amethyst crystals on a plush mat, their purple hues echoing the gentle twilight reflected in her warm brown eyes.

Amelia, known affectionately as "Rosie" to her regulars, was a massage therapist with a gift for intuition.
