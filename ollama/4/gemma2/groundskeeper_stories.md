The late October air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. A lone crow cawed mournfully from the gnarled branches of an ancient oak, its shadow stretching long across the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Manor.  

Elias Theodore Hawthorne, known to all simply as "Eli," surveyed his domain with a practiced eye. He adjusted the brim of his well-worn cap and tugged at his faded blue overalls, feeling the familiar weight of his pruning shears in his calloused hand. The manor, once a bustling hub of grand parties and laughter, now stood silent and imposing against the backdrop of a twilight sky.  The groundskeeper, responsible for its upkeep, was often the only soul present during these quiet hours.

Eli had been tending to Willow Creek Manor for nearly forty years, witnessing generations come and go, each leaving their mark on the sprawling property. He knew every nook and cranny of the gardens, every twist and turn of the gravel paths, every whispering secret held within the ancient walls. But lately, a new unease had settled over him, a feeling that something was amiss, like an unseen shadow lurking just beyond the periphery of his vision.
