The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Kensington, their sterile glow illuminating the rows of pearly whites before her. It was always like this – a silent symphony of scraping tools, whirring drills, and the gentle gurgle of suction as she navigated the inner sanctum of human mouths. Amelia, however, found solace in the ritual. Each tooth, each plaque-ridden surface, felt like a tiny puzzle begging to be solved. 

Her office, nestled within a bustling suburban medical complex, was small but efficient. Mint toothpaste aroma hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of antiseptic. Framed motivational posters adorned the walls, their cheerful slogans clashing slightly with the ever-present hum of machinery. Amelia had learned to tune it all out, focusing instead on the patient before her: a nervous young woman named Claire, whose teeth chattered like castanets as Amelia expertly probed for signs of decay. 


This particular Tuesday morning felt different, however. A prickling sensation danced along Amelia’s spine, a feeling that something was amiss. Perhaps it was the overly enthusiastic chirp of a bird outside her window, or the unsettlingly bright sunlight streaming through the blinds. Whatever it was, Amelia knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that this was no ordinary day.
