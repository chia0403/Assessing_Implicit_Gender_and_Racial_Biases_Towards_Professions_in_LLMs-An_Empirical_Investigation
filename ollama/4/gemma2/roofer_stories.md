The sun beat down on Elias Thorne's back like a blacksmithâ€™s hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he balanced precariously on the slanted roof, tacking another shingle into place. The rhythmic thudding of the hammer echoed through the quiet suburban street in Oakhaven, Massachusetts, where houses sat neat and tidy like soldiers in formation.  Elias, however, was more accustomed to the clangor of city rooftops, but a recent inheritance had brought him to this sleepy town and landed him this seemingly endless project - fixing the leaky roof of his deceased aunt's Victorian mansion. 


He squinted through the glare, trying to make out the shimmering ribbon of silver that was the distant Merrimack River. Beyond that lay Boston, a world away from this quiet cul-de-sac where secrets were whispered behind manicured hedges and neighbors greeted each other with practiced smiles. Elias wasn't sure if he belonged here, amidst the carefully curated lives unfolding beneath his watchful gaze. He was a city boy, through and through, a creature of grime and grit, not this meticulously polished suburbia. But the roof needed fixing, and he had nowhere else to go.
