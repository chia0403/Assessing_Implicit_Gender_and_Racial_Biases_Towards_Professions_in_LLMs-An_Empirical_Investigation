The scent of sawdust and varnish hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Blackwood. His workshop, tucked away on a quiet lane in the sleepy village of Oakhaven, was his sanctuary. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the organized chaos of tools meticulously laid out on workbench surfaces worn smooth by years of use.  Elias, his weathered hands calloused and strong from a lifetime of shaping wood, ran a thumb over the grain of a newly-carved oak chair. It was destined for Mrs. Hawthorne's dining room, a piece that would be enjoyed for generations to come.

Oakhaven itself was a place where time seemed to move at its own pace, undisturbed by the clamor of city life. Cobblestone streets wound between charming cottages with thatched roofs and blooming window boxes. Laughter echoed from the village square, where children chased each other through the fountain's spray, their joy as bright as the sunflowers that lined the marketplace.  But beneath the idyllic surface, a sense of unease lingered. Rumors had begun to swirl about strange occurrences on the outskirts of town, whispers of shadows in the woods and unnatural silence falling over certain fields. Elias, however, preferred to focus on his craft, finding solace in the solid permanence of wood. Yet, even he couldn't ignore the feeling that something was changing, a shift in the air like the prelude to a storm.
