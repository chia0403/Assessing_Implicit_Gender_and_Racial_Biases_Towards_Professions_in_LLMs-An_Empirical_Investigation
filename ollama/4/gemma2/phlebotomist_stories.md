The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the pale beige walls of the clinic waiting room. Amelia Rose Hawthorne adjusted her lavender scrubs and tapped her foot impatiently against the linoleum floor. The clock on the wall ticked with agonizing slowness, each second stretching into an eternity. It wasn't unusual for the late afternoon shift at Riverview Medical Center to be quiet, but today felt especially still, like a lull before a storm. 

Amelia glanced at the name on her next patientâ€™s chart: Harold Jenkins. A shiver ran down her spine. She knew Mr. Jenkins. He was the retired librarian who lived across the street from her, his house perpetually shrouded in a veil of dusty silence. He'd always waved politely when she passed by, but there was something about his eyes, a distant melancholy that had never quite left them, that made her uneasy.  

Suddenly, a gust of wind rattled the windowpanes, sending a shiver through the room. The air grew thick with an unsettling stillness, punctuated only by the faint hum of the refrigerator in the corner. Amelia took a deep breath and straightened her posture. Time to face Mr. Jenkins, whatever he had brought with him from his quiet world.
