The bell above Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s shop door chimed a melancholic welcome as the morning fog drifted in, bringing with it the scent of damp earth and forgotten rain.  Her little shop, “Petal & Prose,” nestled between a bustling bakery and a dusty antique store on Elm Street, was usually abuzz with customers by this time, eager to pick out blooms for birthdays, anniversaries, or simply to brighten their homes. But today, Amelia found herself alone amongst the vibrant chaos of her world.  A tapestry of lilies in every shade of white cascaded over one wall, while sunflowers, bold and golden, leaned precariously towards each other from a nearby shelf. The air hung heavy with the sweet perfume of roses, both classic crimson and delicate blush pink, reminding Amelia of love, loss, and everything in between.

She sighed, tracing her finger along the smooth petals of a velvety burgundy carnation.  It was supposed to be one of the busiest days of the month - Valentine's Day just around the corner - yet the silence felt deafening. It wasn’t unusual for business to dip before a holiday, as people waited until the last minute to make their purchases. But something about the stillness today felt different, unsettling. A prickle of unease crawled up her spine, whispering that something was amiss.  


The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty windowpanes as Amelia sat hunched over her workbench, surrounded by scattered petals and wilting leaves. The air grew colder, and a sense of foreboding settled upon her like a shroud. She glanced at the clock, its hands ticking away relentlessly, each second a hammer blow to her already frayed nerves.
