The air hung thick with the scent of dust and desperation in the Grand Majestic Theatre's cavernous backstage. A single bulb flickered above Alistair Bartholomew Fitzwilliam, casting long shadows that danced across the worn velvet curtains and faded grandeur of the once-famed stage. Alistair, known simply as Al to his dwindling company, ran a hand through his perpetually tousled hair, frustration knotting his brow. The playbills were printed, costumes assembled, and tickets sold â€“ for nothing. This wasn't opening night; it was the third performance in an increasingly empty theatre.  

The city of Veridia had once been a hub of artistic brilliance, but now its heart throbbed with a different rhythm, the steady pulse of progress drowning out the whispers of creativity. The Grand Majestic, a monument to a bygone era, stood as a silent testament to the changing times. But Al refused to let it fall into oblivion. He clung to hope like a lifeline, believing that Veridia's soul still craved the magic only a live performance could offer. 


Al stared at his reflection in a dusty mirror propped against a forgotten prop chest. His eyes, usually sparkling with theatrical fervor, were dull with worry. Yet, beneath the surface of despair, a stubborn ember of determination flickered. He wouldn't let them win. Veridia deserved its stories, even if it had to be fought for, one empty seat at a time.
