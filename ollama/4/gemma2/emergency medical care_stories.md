The rain hammered against the ambulance windows, a relentless assault mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Hayes' heart.  She gripped the gurney handles, knuckles white, as she navigated the slick streets of Baltimore. The flashing lights cut through the downpour, illuminating faces contorted in fear and desperation. This wasn't her first rodeo - Amelia was a seasoned EMT with the Baltimore City Fire Department, used to navigating chaos with a calm exterior and a cool head. But this call… this call felt different.  

The dispatcher had been tight-lipped, only saying "Possible multi-casualty incident," followed by an address in a derelict part of town. Her partner, rookie EMT Ben Carter, was pale behind his helmet, nervously adjusting his mask. Amelia could understand – this wasn't the usual drunk-and-disorderly or domestic dispute call. 

The ambulance screeched to a halt on a street choked with puddles and overflowing trash bins. Rain slicked the asphalt, making it treacherous. A heavy silence hung in the air, punctuated only by the incessant drumming of rain and the distant wail of sirens. In the dim light filtering through the clouds, Amelia saw something out of place: a single bicycle lying half-submerged in a puddle, its bright pink frame a jarring contrast to the grim surroundings.  A knot tightened in her stomach. Something was terribly wrong.
