The air hung thick with the scent of buttercream and vanilla, a symphony of sweetness that Amelia Rosalind Everly knew better than any concerto. Her bakery, "Sugarspun Dreams," was a haven nestled on a quiet cobblestone street in Bath, England.  Sunlight streamed through the frosted windows, illuminating the rainbow of sprinkles scattered across her counter like confetti and the shelves piled high with glistening cake boards. It was a Saturday morning, normally Ameliaâ€™s busiest time, but today the shop felt strangely empty. 

Her usual pre-noon flurry of phone calls hadn't materialized. Even the delivery van driver, a gruff man named Barry who always arrived precisely at ten o'clock, was noticeably absent. A shiver ran down Amelia's spine. Something wasn't right.
