Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her own mind. She traced patterns on the condensation with a trembling finger, her gaze fixed on the swirling grey outside.  Eleanor wasn't sure what was more unsettling: the deluge that threatened to flood the tiny coastal town of Saltwind or the silence emanating from the plush armchair across from her. Her client, Amelia Hayes, usually a vibrant whirlwind of anxieties and neuroses, had become eerily subdued this session.

Saltwind was a place where secrets clung to the mist-shrouded cliffs and whispered on the wind, and sometimes, those secrets found their way into Dr. Vance's office. She just hoped this one wouldn't drown her.
