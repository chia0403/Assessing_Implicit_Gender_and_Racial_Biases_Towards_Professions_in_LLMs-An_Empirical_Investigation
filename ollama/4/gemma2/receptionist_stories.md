The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Grace Blackwood's manicured nails against her pristine mahogany desk echoed through the otherwise silent office. Outside, the Chicago skyline was ablaze with the hues of a late summer sunset, casting long shadows across the glass and steel facade of the Grandview Building. Inside, however, it was a world governed by muted tones: beige walls, grey carpet, and the faint scent of stale coffee lingered in the air. 

Amelia sighed, her emerald eyes flitting over the sparse line-up of appointments on her screen. Wednesday afternoons were always the slowest at Blackwood & Sons Attorneys at Law, a fact that both frustrated and comforted her. Frustrated because it left her with an abundance of time to contemplate the dusty novels piled precariously on her desk and comfort because it meant she could indulge in her favourite pastime â€“ people-watching from behind the sleek reception desk. Today's entertainment so far had been a particularly nervous young woman clutching a crumpled file and a man with a handlebar moustache who seemed determined to negotiate his parking ticket into a life insurance policy. 


But as Amelia reached for her untouched cappuccino, the chime of the intercom shattered the quiet. "Ms. Blackwood," the voice crackled through, "Mr. Blackwood requests your presence immediately." The warmth in her mug suddenly felt like it was mocking her.
