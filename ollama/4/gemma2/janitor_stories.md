The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and regret in the bowels of the Grand Majestic Theatre. Elias Thorne, custodian by trade and dreamer by nature, pushed his mop across the damp linoleum floor of the orchestra pit, its worn bristles scraping against the chipped paint. Moonlight streamed through a cracked skylight, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness like miniature constellations. 

Elias had always imagined the theatre humming with life, filled with the gasps and applause of an audience captivated by the spectacle on stage. But for him, it was a graveyard of forgotten dreams, a silent monument to a bygone era. The velvet curtains were faded and dusty, the plush seats ripped and vacant. Only the echo of his own footsteps broke the eerie quiet. He yearned for the days when the theatre throbbed with energy, when he wasn't just cleaning up after ghosts, but witnessing their stories unfold.
