The scent of crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet, sugary aroma of spilled juice boxes. Sunlight streamed through the windows of Ms. Amelia Rose Butterfield's classroom, illuminating a scene of controlled chaos. A rainbow of finger-painted masterpieces adorned the walls, alongside wobbly drawings proclaiming "I Love My Mommy" and "Dinosaurs are Cool."  

Amelia watched from her desk as three little girls huddled together in a corner, their voices hushed and conspiratorial.  She knew they were plotting something â€“ probably involving glitter glue and a stray piece of construction paper. A gentle smile curved Amelia's lips. It was moments like these, the everyday magic of kindergarten, that kept her coming back year after year.
