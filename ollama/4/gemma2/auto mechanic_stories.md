The grease clung to Amelia "Amy" Ramirez's hands like a second skin. The tang of motor oil hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of metal on metal from the other bay. Sweat beaded on her forehead, reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights that illuminated the dimly lit garage. She wiped it away with the back of her hand, leaving a fresh streak across her already smudged face. 

Amy's Auto Repair wasn't much to look at â€“ a single-story building tucked away in a forgotten corner of San Francisco, its faded green paint peeling like sunburnt skin. But within those walls, Amy was a queen. She knew every bolt, every hose, every whir and clunk that emanated from the vehicles that rolled into her garage. Her fingers danced across engines with practiced ease, diagnosing problems that baffled even seasoned mechanics. 


Today, though, she had a new challenge: a sleek, silver sports car with an engine that was sputtering like a dying firefly. The owner, a man whose expensive suit seemed out of place in Amy's world, stood impatiently beside her, tapping his foot and radiating the kind of entitlement that made Amy want to roll her eyes so hard they got stuck.  

This wasn't going to be easy.
