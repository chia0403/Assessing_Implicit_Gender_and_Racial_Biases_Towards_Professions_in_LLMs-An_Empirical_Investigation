The smoky haze of The Blue Moon Club hung thick in the air, clinging to Esmeralda "Esme" Beaumont like a second skin.  Her red sequined dress shimmered under the stage lights, each bead catching the glint of the spotlight as she stood center stage, microphone clutched in her hand. The crowd was a sea of swaying bodies and raised glasses, their faces blurred by the dimness, their cheers lost to the rhythm pulsing from the band behind her. This wasn't some glitzy Vegas showroom or a packed concert hall - this was Esme's haven, a dive bar tucked away in the forgotten corner of New Orleans where she poured her heart and soul into every song.  Tonight, like every night, she hoped to lose herself in the music, if only for a few fleeting hours, escaping the weight of the past that shadowed her like a persistent storm cloud.
