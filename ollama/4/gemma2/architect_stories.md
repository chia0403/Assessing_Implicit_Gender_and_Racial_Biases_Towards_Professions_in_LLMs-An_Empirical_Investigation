The scent of damp earth and freshly cut cedar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of burning leaves.  A thin layer of mist clung to the valley floor, shrouding the construction site in an ethereal veil. Eleanor Genevieve Prescott, her name as long and winding as the creek that bisected the property, surveyed the scene with a critical eye. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the skeletal frame of the future "Havenwood Retreat", a sprawling wellness center designed to blend seamlessly into the rugged beauty of the Montana wilderness.  Eleanor, a woman known for her meticulous attention to detail and audacious designs, had poured her heart and soul into this project. It was her masterpiece, a testament to both her artistic vision and her unwavering belief in the power of nature to heal. But as she gazed upon the half-finished structure, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. 


Something felt...off.
