The aroma of cardamom and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of jasmine tea steaming from a nearby pot. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of "A World Away," illuminating rows of well-worn guidebooks and framed travel posters plastered on the walls.  Eleanor Beatrice Harper, known to everyone as Ellie, leaned back in her creaky swivel chair, her gaze drifting over the chaotic scene. A half-finished itinerary for a family trip to Machu Picchu lay on her desk, its edges curling from weeks of being tucked between stacks of brochures and maps. 

Ellie's travel agency, nestled in a quiet corner of Edinburgh, was far from glamorous. It wasn’t about luxury resorts or private jets; it was about finding that hidden gem, the off-the-beaten-path adventure that resonated with her clients' souls. She prided herself on crafting journeys that were more than just vacations, they were transformative experiences.  But lately, a nagging feeling of discontent had been creeping into Ellie’s usually sunny disposition. The travel bug had bitten her hard, and the dream of embarking on her own grand adventure was growing stronger with each passing day.
