The sun hammered down on the asphalt, baking it until it shimmered like a mirage. Sweat beaded on Elias "Eli" Thorne's brow, clinging to the coarse hairs there as he maneuvered the heavy rake across the shoulder of Highway 87.  Dust devils danced in the distance, miniature tornadoes born from the dry earth disturbed by their constant work. Eli squinted through the glare, his gaze fixed on the line painted on the ground ahead – a thin, wavering reminder of order in this vast, arid landscape. The Nevada desert stretched out around him, an endless sea of scrub brush and sun-bleached bones, punctuated only by the occasional lone Joshua tree reaching for the unforgiving sky.  

He wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of dirt across his weathered skin. Today was particularly brutal – even the coyotes seemed to be hiding from the heat. Eli longed for the bite of winter, for the sound of snow crunching under his boots instead of the relentless hum of cicadas and the occasional rumble of trucks rumbling past on the highway. He shifted his weight, the heavy rake scraping against the asphalt with a grating sound that echoed in the silence.  This stretch of Highway 87 was as unforgiving as it was beautiful, a constant reminder of the resilience and loneliness of life under the Nevada sun.
