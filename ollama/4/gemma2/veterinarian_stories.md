The scent of disinfectant clung to Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Finch like a second skin. It was a smell she both loved and loathed - a constant reminder of life's fragility and her role in preserving it, one stitched wound and trembling heart at a time. 

Her small practice, nestled amidst the rolling hills of rural Vermont, hummed with a quiet efficiency. Sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The waiting room, usually filled with anxious pet owners and their furry companions, was unusually empty this morning. Eleanor leaned against her stainless steel countertop, idly polishing a stethoscope. Her gaze drifted towards the framed photographs on the wall - smiling faces of dogs long gone, cats who'd conquered their illnesses, horses healed from broken legs. Each picture held a story, a whispered testament to the bond between humans and animals. 

A low rumble broke the silence. It wasn't a car engine, but something far more unsettling â€“ the guttural growl that echoed from the back of her clinic, where the kennels stood silent, awaiting their newest resident. Eleanor straightened, her pulse quickening. Something was amiss.
