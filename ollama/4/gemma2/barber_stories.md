The midday sun beat down on Bellweather Street, turning the brick sidewalks into shimmering mirages. The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions from Mrs. O'Malley's cafe next door and stale cigarette smoke from the corner bodega. It was the kind of day that made even a seasoned barber like Bartholomew 'Bart' Fitzwilliam long for the cool solace of his shop. 

He pushed open the heavy oak door, its brass hinges groaning in protest after another scorching day. The familiar bell above tinkled as he entered, announcing his arrival to the emptiness within. Bart surveyed his domain:  the worn leather chairs lined up like sentinels, the gleaming chrome of the barber poles reflecting the dusty sunlight filtering through the shop's single front window. A faint scent of bay rum and talcum powder lingered in the air, a comforting reminder of better days. 


It was always eerily quiet in the morning before the rush began. The silence held a strange tension, broken only by the rhythmic hum of the electric fan battling the heat and the distant rumble of the city awakening around him.
