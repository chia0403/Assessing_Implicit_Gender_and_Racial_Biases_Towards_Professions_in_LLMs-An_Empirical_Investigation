The acrid scent of turpentine hung heavy in Amelia Rosalind Hawthorne's studio, clinging to her faded denim overalls like a second skin. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced through the grime-coated skylight, illuminating the chaotic landscape of her workspace. Half-finished canvases leaned precariously against easels, their vibrant colours clashing with the muted grey of the walls. Tubes of paint lay scattered across a battered wooden table, alongside brushes, palette knives, and crumpled sketches – remnants of Amelia’s relentless pursuit of capturing the ephemeral beauty of the world around her. 

Her small attic studio, nestled within an ancient, rambling Victorian house in the heart of Edinburgh, was a sanctuary from the bustling city below. Here, amongst the whispers of forgotten memories and the ghosts of past creations, Amelia felt truly alive.  But today, the air buzzed with a nervous energy. Today was the day of the annual "Emerging Artists" exhibition at the National Gallery of Scotland, and Amelia’s heart pounded like a drum against her ribs.
