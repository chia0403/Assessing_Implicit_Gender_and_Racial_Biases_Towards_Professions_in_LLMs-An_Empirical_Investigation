The air in the drafting room was thick with the scent of stale coffee and graphite dust. Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright, her brow furrowed in concentration, tapped away at her mechanical pencil, sketching precise lines onto the blueprint spread before her. Outside, the Chicago wind howled like a banshee, rattling the windows of the Art Deco building where she worked. But inside, the only sound was the soft scratch of graphite and the hum of the old drafting table lamp, casting long shadows across Eleanor's workspace. 

Eleanor wasn't just any drafting worker. She was the best in the city, known for her meticulous detail and uncanny ability to visualize structures before they were ever built. Her latest project, however, was proving to be more challenging than anything she had encountered before: a soaring skyscraper designed by the enigmatic architect, Alistair Finch. Finch was a legend in the architectural world, but his blueprints were notoriously complex and riddled with cryptic notes.  Eleanor felt a shiver run down her spine as she traced the intricate lines of the design. This project wasn't just about building a skyscraper; it was about unraveling the secrets hidden within its very core.
