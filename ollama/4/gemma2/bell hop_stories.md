The humid Georgia air clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Finch like a damp shroud as he lugged another overstuffed suitcase up the grand staircase of the Grand Magnolia Hotel. The polished oak banisters felt slick beneath his fingertips, and beads of sweat trickled down his temples despite the crisp white linen uniform he wore. He could smell the faint aroma of jasmine wafting from Mrs. Hemmings' prized garden through the open French doors on the landing, a fleeting reminder that somewhere beyond these mahogany walls, life existed outside the confines of this gilded cage.

Barty had been a bellhop at the Grand Magnolia for five years, long enough to memorize every creak and groan of the building, every guest's preferred brand of coffee, and every whisper exchanged in hushed tones on the balconies overlooking the manicured lawns. The life wasnâ€™t glamorous; it was repetitive, demanding, and often tinged with a melancholic undercurrent.  But the stories he overheard, the snippets of lives unfolding behind closed doors, kept him fascinated. He felt like an invisible observer, privy to secrets whispered in the dead of night and dreams spun beneath the flickering gas lamps.

This particular evening, however, promised something different. A palpable buzz hummed through the air, fueled by the anticipation of a gala being held later that night. The hotel bustled with activity, maids scurried with feather dusters, waiters practiced their salutations, and even the usually stoic head chef seemed to have a spring in his step. Barty couldn't shake the feeling that tonight, something momentous was about to happen.
