The low hum of conversation mingled with the clinking of cutlery and the rhythmic clatter of plates being cleared. Isabella “Izzy” Ramirez wiped down a sticky table, her eyes scanning the bustling scene of "The Rusty Spoon" diner.  

It was Friday night, the most chaotic time for Izzy. The small town of Harmony Creek had exploded in population since the Harvest Festival kicked off yesterday, bringing with it a wave of tourists eager to sample the local apple cider donuts and artisanal jam.  Izzy knew every inch of this place - the worn linoleum floor that perpetually smelled faintly of bacon grease, the cracked Formica countertop where regulars left their change, even the loose tile in the bathroom that always made a disconcerting clicking noise when stepped on. 

Despite the chaos, Izzy felt strangely calm. She had memorized the menu by heart, knew the regulars' orders by sight, and could juggle three trays full of food without breaking a sweat.  Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she caught a glimpse of a tall figure in the corner booth, his face hidden under a wide-brimmed hat. He seemed out of place amongst the jovial crowds and smelled strangely of rain and woodsmoke. 


This wasn't just another Friday night at The Rusty Spoon.  Izzy had a feeling something was about to change.
