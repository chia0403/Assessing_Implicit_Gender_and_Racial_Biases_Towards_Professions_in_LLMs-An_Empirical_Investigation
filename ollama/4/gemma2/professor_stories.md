The biting wind whipped through the ancient oaks lining the cobbled path leading up to Blackwood University, their skeletal branches groaning under the weight of freshly fallen snow.  Professor Eleanor Willowgrove, her breath misting in the frigid air, clutched her worn leather satchel closer to her chest as she ascended the hill. 

Eleanor was a woman whose presence commanded attention even amidst the bustle of university life. Her silver hair, pulled back from her high forehead in a severe bun, framed a face etched with the wisdom and weariness of countless semesters spent dissecting ancient texts and guiding young minds. Her piercing blue eyes, however, still held a spark of youthful curiosity, alight with the thrill of uncovering hidden truths within dusty tomes.  Tonight, that curiosity was particularly piqued. A letter had arrived earlier, addressed to her in an elegant script she didn't recognize, hinting at a discovery that could rewrite history itself.  

As she neared the imposing gothic facade of Blackwood's main building, Eleanor felt a shiver run down her spine, not entirely from the cold. This wasn't just another lecture night. Tonight, something was different. A sense of foreboding hung heavy in the air, a whisper of secrets waiting to be unearthed.
