The humid Alabama air hung heavy in the cramped repair shack, thick with the scent of ozone and old solder.  Sparks hissed from Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne's soldering iron as she carefully attached a new capacitor to the vintage Zenith console radio. A faint crackle filled the air, followed by a burst of static.

“Come on, you old bird,” Amy muttered, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her hand. “Don’t give me trouble now.” 

She was deep in the heart of Pine Ridge, Mississippi, a town so small it barely registered on most maps.  Pine Ridge’s residents considered Amy's shack, nestled behind the dusty general store, to be a vital lifeline. In this isolated community where cell towers couldn’t reach and internet connections were as rare as unicorns, radio was king.  It was Amy’s job to keep the kingdom humming. 


Outside, cicadas droned their ceaseless symphony, punctuated by the distant rumble of a tractor engine. The only other sound in the shack was the rhythmic click of Amy's tools against metal, a steady pulse in the stillness. This quiet solitude, she found, was where her mind truly worked, where the tangled threads of circuitry and electrical impulses made sense. It was also where she could escape the loneliness that sometimes weighed heavy on her soul.
