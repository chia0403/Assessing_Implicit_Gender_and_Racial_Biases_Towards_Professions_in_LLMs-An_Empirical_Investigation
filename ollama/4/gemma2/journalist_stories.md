The stale scent of cheap coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of The Daily Grind’s newsroom. Empty coffee cups littered the desks, abandoned like fallen soldiers in the relentless war against deadlines. Fiona "Fi" McArthur, her dark hair pulled back into a messy bun, hunched over her laptop, the pale glow of the screen reflecting in her tired hazel eyes. Outside, the city of Aurora hummed with its usual symphony of car horns and distant sirens, oblivious to the storm brewing within The Daily Grind’s cramped walls. 

Fi had been on this story for three weeks, chasing a rumor that felt as elusive as smoke: whispers of a clandestine organization operating beneath Aurora's gleaming surface. The kind of story that could make her career, but also one that could easily land her in hot water. The pressure was mounting, the editor breathing down her neck, and Fi had a gnawing feeling that she was close – tantalisingly close – to breaking through. 


The only question was: Would she break before the story did?
