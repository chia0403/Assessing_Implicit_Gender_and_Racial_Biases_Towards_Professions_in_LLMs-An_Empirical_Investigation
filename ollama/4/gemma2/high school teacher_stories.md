The bell's shrill cry sliced through Amelia "Amy" Rosethorn's carefully curated morning routine – a sunrise yoga flow accompanied by calming flute music – leaving her feeling less zen master and more startled owl. She sighed, smoothing down the wrinkles in her hemp blouse as she surveyed her chaotic classroom.  

Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Room 214 at Northwood High, illuminating swirling motes of dust and half-collapsed paper airplanes scattered across every available surface. A lone coffee mug sat precariously on a stack of textbooks, threatening to topple over with each nervous tremor in Amy's hand.  

Outside, the bustling streets of Oakhaven hummed with the energy of a Monday morning, oblivious to the impending disaster that was about to unfold within these four walls. 


Northwood High wasn’t exactly known for its academic prowess. It was a place where teenagers navigated the turbulent waters of adolescence with varying degrees of success (mostly failing), and Amy, fresh out of college and bursting with idealism, was determined to be their lighthouse in the storm.  

Little did she know, this Monday morning would mark her first encounter with the real chaos that lay beneath Oakhaven's seemingly idyllic facade.
