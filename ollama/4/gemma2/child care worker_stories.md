The aroma of burnt toast and sugary cereal hung thick in the air, a sickly sweet scent that permeated Amelia Eleanor Finchâ€™s very being as she surveyed the chaotic breakfast scene before her. Tiny hands clutched at sticky spoons, juice boxes lay abandoned on the floor like deflated balloons, and the remnants of what might have been scrambled eggs sat congealed in a corner of the playpen.  

Amelia, all elbows and boundless energy despite the sleep-deprived droop of her smile, was the lighthouse in this storm of sticky fingers and sugared chaos. 

Her sanctuary, "Sunshine Sprouts" day care center, was a riot of color and noise tucked away on a quiet street lined with Victorian homes that seemed to lean precariously towards each other like gossiping old women. The once pristine white walls were now adorned with brightly colored fingerprints and crayon masterpieces, and the worn play mats had seen more spills than a water park. Despite the organized pandemonium, Amelia found a strange sort of beauty in it all.  It was her haven, her purpose - to nurture these tiny humans who burst into her life like miniature tornados of laughter and tears, leaving behind a trail of glitter, crayon shavings, and boundless love.
