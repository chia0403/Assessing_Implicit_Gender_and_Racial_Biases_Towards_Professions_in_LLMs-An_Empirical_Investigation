The smell of stale coffee and yesterday's desperation clung to Amelia "Amy" Brighton's floral blouse like a second skin. The office hummed with the low thrum of fluorescent lights and the frantic tapping of keyboards. Amy, perched precariously on her too-high stool, sipped lukewarm tea from a chipped mug emblazoned with the word "boss." She watched Mr. Bartholomew, her boss – a man whose temperament could shift from jovial to thunderous in the blink of an eye – bark orders at his assistant through the thin walls separating their cubicles. 

The setting was the fifth floor of a sprawling, Art Deco office building in the heart of Manhattan. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the haze of dust motes swirling in the air, illuminating the polished mahogany desks and the worn leather armchairs scattered throughout the open-plan office. The year was 1963. Change was brewing, both on the streets below and within the walls of this dusty old building, but for Amy, it felt as if she were stuck in a perpetual loop of answering phones, scheduling meetings, and dreading Mr. Bartholomew's increasingly volatile moods.
