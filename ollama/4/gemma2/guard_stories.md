The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aethelgard, carrying with it the scent of frost and distant smoke. A crimson sun bled into the horizon, casting long shadows from the jagged obsidian spires that guarded the city walls.  Elias Thornehaven, his breath misting in the frigid air, tightened his grip on the spear haft. He was a veteran of the 3rd Cohort, his scarred face a testament to countless skirmishes with the nomadic tribes of the Steppes.  He squinted through the swirling snow, scanning the endless expanse for any flicker of movement that might betray an enemy approach. The silence was heavy, broken only by the rasp of the wind and the distant clang of hammer on metal from within the city's forge district. 


Tonight, Elias felt a prickling unease crawl up his spine. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the snow swirling around them. It wasn't just the biting cold; it was something more primal, a sense that something was amiss.  He glanced at his fellow guards, their faces grim and alert, mirroring his own apprehension. 


They were on the eastern wall, the furthest from the bustling heart of Aethelgard, facing the vast expanse where darkness seemed to hold sway over light. It was a lonely post, but tonight, it felt more desolate than ever.
