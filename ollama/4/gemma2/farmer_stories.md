The first rays of dawn painted Elara Thistlewood's weathered face with stripes of orange and gold as she squinted out over her fields. Dew clung to the cornstalks like tiny diamonds, reflecting the sunrise in a thousand scattered sparkles. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and honeysuckle, a symphony of nature's awakening that Elara had known since childhood. Her farm, nestled in the rolling hills of Oakhaven Valley, was her lifeblood. Generations of Thistlewoods had tilled these lands, coaxing bounty from the soil with calloused hands and unwavering dedication. But this year, something felt different. A heaviness hung in the air, a sense of foreboding that tugged at Elara's gut like an untethered kite in the wind. 


It was more than just the strange silence among the birds, or the withered patches appearing amongst her prized sunflower stalks. It was a feeling she couldn't quite place, a whisper of change on the horizon, a storm brewing beyond the horizon of familiar fields.
