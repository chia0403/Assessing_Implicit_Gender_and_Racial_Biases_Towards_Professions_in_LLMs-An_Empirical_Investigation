The highway stretched before Elara Beatrice "Ellie" McTavish like a ribbon unwinding into the heart of the Arizona desert.  Sun-bleached asphalt shimmered under the unforgiving glare, baking the air until it hummed with heat. Dust devils danced along the roadside, their swirling forms mimicking the restless energy churning within Ellie. Her rig, nicknamed "Betsy," rumbled beneath her, a steel behemoth groaning with every mile chewed through by its powerful diesel engine. Betsy was Ellie's sanctuary, her escape from the stifling confines of small-town life and the ghosts that haunted her past. She knew these roads like the back of her calloused hand – every twist and turn, every greasy diner with a faded neon sign promising "home cooked meals," every desolate rest stop whispering tales of lonely wanderers.

Today, though, something felt different. A prickling unease ran down Ellie's spine, a sensation she usually dismissed as the desert playing tricks on her imagination. But today, the silence was too profound, broken only by the low hum of Betsy's engine and the distant cry of a hawk circling high above.  The air itself seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something – or someone – to break the spell.
