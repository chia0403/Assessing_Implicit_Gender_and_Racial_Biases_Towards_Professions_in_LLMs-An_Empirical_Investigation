The neon sign outside "Glitter & Grit" cast an oily rainbow across the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Thorne chewed on her thumbnail, watching the clock tick past eight. Another slow night at the vintage jewelry store.  

Amelia had been slinging pearls and promising diamonds to tourists and locals alike for six months now, ever since graduating with a degree in…well, something vaguely related to business, she couldn't quite remember. The only thing she remembered clearly was that it hadn’t prepared her for this: the endless parade of "Are you open?" at three am and "Do you have any earrings with *sparkles*?" 

The door chimed, a hopeful jingle in the otherwise quiet shop. Amelia looked up, bracing herself for another lost soul seeking a bargain on cubic zirconia.  


This time, it wasn't another tourist. A man stood in the doorway, his silhouette obscured by the flickering neon light. He wore a long trench coat and a fedora pulled low over his eyes. He looked like he belonged in a film noir, not amidst Amelia's carefully curated collection of Victorian brooches and art deco necklaces.
