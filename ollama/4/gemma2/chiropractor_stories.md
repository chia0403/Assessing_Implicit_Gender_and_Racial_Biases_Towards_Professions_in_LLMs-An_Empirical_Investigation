The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's clinic, painting stripes of warm light across her worn linoleum floor. The air was thick with the scent of eucalyptus and lavender, a comforting aroma Ellie had cultivated over the years to soothe her patients' anxieties. Outside, a restless wind whipped through the cottonwood trees lining Main Street in Dustbowl, Arizona, a town where the relentless sun beat down on parched earth and dreams just as easily withered. 

Ellie adjusted her glasses, their wire frames glinting under the lamplight, and glanced at the clock ticking loudly on the wall â€“ 4:57 pm. Just three minutes left before closing time. She was about to switch off the neon sign that beckoned weary travelers with the promise of spinal alignment and relief when the bell above the door jingled, announcing a late visitor.
