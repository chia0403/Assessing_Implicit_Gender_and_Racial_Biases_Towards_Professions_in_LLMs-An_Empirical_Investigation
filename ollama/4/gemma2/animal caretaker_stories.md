The morning mist clung to Amelia Juniper Thorne's boots as she made her rounds through the expansive enclosures at Wildhaven Sanctuary. A symphony of chirps, growls, and squawks greeted her, the familiar chorus of over 100 rescued animals calling this sprawling haven home. The scent of damp earth mingled with hay and the musky musk of the big cats, a comforting blend that Amelia had come to associate with peace, even on days like this. A storm was brewing, gathering dark clouds above the treetops, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Amelia herself. 


The sanctuary, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, wasn't just Amelia's job; it was her legacy. It was a haven built by her grandfather, a man who believed every creature deserved a chance at a safe and happy life. Now, facing mounting debts and dwindling donations, Wildhaven teetered on the precipice of closure. Amelia had poured everything she had into keeping it afloat, but the storm clouds felt closer than ever, threatening to engulf not only the sanctuary but her own fragile world as well.
