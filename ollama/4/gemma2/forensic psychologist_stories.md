The flickering neon sign outside The Rusty Bucket cast an oily sheen across Dr. Amelia Grace’s rain-slicked trench coat. She tugged her collar tighter against the damp chill of the Seattle night, the scent of stale beer and desperation clinging to the air like a second skin. This wasn't exactly the cozy dinner with friends she had envisioned for her Friday evening, but when you’re a forensic psychologist specializing in homicidal tendencies, Friday nights often blurred into one long, unsettling case file.

The Rusty Bucket was notorious. It sat on the edge of Pike Place Market, a grimy haven for drifters and lost souls, its clientele mirroring the city's underbelly – addicts, hustlers, and the occasional escapee from the clink. Tonight, it housed a different kind of resident:  a man named Silas Thorne, accused of bludgeoning his business partner to death with a baseball bat during a heated argument over profits. He sat hunched in a corner booth, shrouded in shadows like a gargoyle watching the city's secrets unfold beneath him. 


Amelia took a deep breath, her gaze lingering on the empty shot glasses scattered around Silas. This wasn’t just about profiling; it was about understanding the man behind the crime, peeling back the layers of his psyche to unravel the truth buried within. She was hoping tonight wouldn't be another night she left questioning if some monsters were better left locked away.
