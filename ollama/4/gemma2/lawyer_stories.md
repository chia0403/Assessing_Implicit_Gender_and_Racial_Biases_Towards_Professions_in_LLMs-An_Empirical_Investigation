The rain hammered against the windowpanes of Amelia "Amy" Celeste's office like an army of tiny fists, each blow echoing the relentless drumming in her chest. The cityscape outside, normally a glittering tapestry of lights, was shrouded in a grey curtain, reflecting the storm brewing within her.  

Amy wasn't usually one to be rattled. Years spent navigating the treacherous waters of corporate law had honed her nerves to steel. But this case... This case felt different. It was personal. A young woman, barely out of college, accused of embezzlement by a ruthless corporation, a company whose CEO Amy once admired. 

Her office, on the thirty-fifth floor of an imposing skyscraper in the heart of Manhattan, seemed to shrink around her. The plush leather armchair, usually a haven of calm amidst the chaos, now felt like a cage.  Every detail – the scent of old books and polished mahogany, the faint hum of the city's relentless energy filtering through the double-paned glass – served as a reminder of the impossible task before her: fight a Goliath with a slingshot.
