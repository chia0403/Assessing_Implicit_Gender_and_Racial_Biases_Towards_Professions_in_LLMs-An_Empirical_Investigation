The humid Georgia air clung to Elias Finnigan like a second skin as he crouched beneath the sputtering porch light.  A swarm of mosquitoes buzzed around his head, their incessant whine a soundtrack to his frustrated muttering. He tightened a loose connection on the wiring, hoping this would be the fix that banished the flickering demon tormenting Mrs. Henderson’s home. The old woman had been complaining for weeks about the light doing “the jitterbug,” as she called it. Elias suspected it was more than just loose wires; the house itself seemed to hum with an unsettling energy, like a dormant beast stirring in its sleep.

The porch creaked beneath his weight as he straightened up, dust motes dancing in the fading sunlight. The Henderson place sat on the edge of Savannah’s historic district, a rambling Victorian mansion draped in ivy and shrouded in secrets. The house had been empty for years, its windows like vacant eyes staring out onto the overgrown lawn. But when Mrs. Henderson moved in, she brought life back to the neglected property, her laughter echoing through the silent halls. 


Elias was drawn to the challenge of working on the old wiring, a tangled labyrinth of copper and brass dating back to the house’s construction in the late 1800s. He felt a strange connection to the place, as if the house whispered forgotten stories to him through the hum of its electrical currents.  But tonight, the whispers seemed different, tinged with an underlying unease that sent shivers down his spine.
