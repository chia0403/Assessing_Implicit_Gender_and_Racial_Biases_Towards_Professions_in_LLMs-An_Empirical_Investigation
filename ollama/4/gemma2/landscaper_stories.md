The humid Georgia air clung to Elara Willowbrook like a damp shroud as she surveyed Mrs. Henderson's overgrown backyard. A symphony of cicadas buzzed in the dogwood trees, their rhythmic chirping punctuated by the distant thrum of lawnmowers from other yards.  Elara adjusted her straw sunhat, its wide brim doing little to shield her face from the relentless July sun. This wasn't exactly the idyllic escape she'd imagined when she'd left her cramped city apartment for a life among the sprawling greenery of Atlanta's suburbs. 

Mrs. Henderson's backyard was a jungle of unruly weeds, tangled rose bushes, and a gnarled oak that threatened to engulf the patio entirely. A rusted swing set stood sentinel in one corner, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  This wasn't just another landscaping job for Elara. It felt personal. This was where she had played as a child, climbing the oak tree and swinging high enough to touch the clouds. She'd spent countless summers here with her grandmother, Mrs. Henderson's sister, before tragedy had swept them both away. Now, looking at this overgrown paradise, Elara saw echoes of her own childhood joy, tinged with a bittersweet nostalgia that made her heart ache.
