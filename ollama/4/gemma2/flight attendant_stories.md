The flickering blue light of the overhead panel illuminated Amelia Rose Cartwright’s face as she diligently completed her pre-flight checks. Her reflection stared back at her – tired eyes framed by dark circles, a faint smile playing on her lips, and her signature messy bun threatening to escape its confines. The air in the Boeing 747 hummed with a low, reassuring thrum, a familiar lullaby to Amelia after fifteen years of traversing the globe as a flight attendant for Air Zenith.

Tonight's destination: Bangkok. A bustling metropolis she’d yet to fully explore, promising vibrant street markets, ancient temples, and maybe even a glimpse of the legendary floating markets. But right now, all that mattered was Flight 784 to LAX – a typical red-eye, packed with weary travelers eager for their weekend getaways. The usual mix: tired businessmen, giggling honeymooners, families crammed into too-small seats, each with their own story waiting to unfold in the next few hours.

Amelia adjusted her crisp blue uniform, took a deep breath of the recycled cabin air, and turned towards the passenger door, ready to usher in the world of travel, one smile at a time.
