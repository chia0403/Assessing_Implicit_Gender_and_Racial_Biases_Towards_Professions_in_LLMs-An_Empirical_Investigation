The year was starting to settle into a familiar rhythm - the daily dose of finger painting explosions followed by the inevitable "What are we learning about today?" barrage directed at Ms. Cavendish with wide-eyed innocence.  Today's lesson was on the alphabet, but even as she started the day with her usual blend of rhyme and song, a knot of unease twisted in her stomach.
