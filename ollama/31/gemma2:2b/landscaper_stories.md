The morning mist clung to the emerald green canopy like a thirsty child clinging to its mother's breast. It was so thick that even the sunlight struggled to pierce through it, painting the world in shades of cool gray and muted blue.  A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the willow tree where young Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne knelt, meticulously trimming a stray branch with her trusty shears. 

It wasn't just any willow. This one was special. Its sprawling branches had been the only constant in Amy's life for as long as she could remember, its presence grounding her in a world that often felt chaotic and unpredictable.  The willow stood at the heart of Oakhaven Estate, a sprawling manor with secrets whispered on the wind, hidden behind ivy-choked walls and guarded by an unseen force. It had been entrusted to Amy's care since her grandmother's passing, its legacy as intertwined with hers as the roots that burrowed deep beneath the earth. 

Today was a special day.  A new resident of Oakhaven, a young woman named Eleanor, was moving in.  Amy wasn't excited about it, not really. The estate had always held a sense of mystery and isolation for Amy; now, with Eleanor entering its fragile ecosystem, she felt an unsettling sense of unease creep into her bones.
