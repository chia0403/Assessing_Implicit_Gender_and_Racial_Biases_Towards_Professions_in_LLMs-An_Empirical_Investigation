The scent of old books mingled with antiseptic spray in Dr. Amelia Thorne's office at Willow Creek High School. Sunlight filtered weakly through the stained-glass window, casting kaleidoscopic shapes on the worn carpet and dust motes dancing in the air. The walls were lined with posters proclaiming "Reach for Your Dreams" and "Be Kind," a faded image of a boy with a shy smile staring out from one poster.  Amelia ran her finger over his face, remembering how easily he'd opened up to her after years of struggling to connect.

It wasnâ€™t unusual for families in Willow Creek; everyone knew someone who needed help or had been touched by grief or trauma. Dr. Thorne's heart felt heavy with the knowledge that this town was full of stories like hers, and each one felt particularly poignant in the quiet, melancholic atmosphere of her office.
