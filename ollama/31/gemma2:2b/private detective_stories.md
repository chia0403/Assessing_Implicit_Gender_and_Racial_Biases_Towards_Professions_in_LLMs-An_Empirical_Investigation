Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Pierce's cramped apartment, blurring the neon glow of the city beyond. The scent of stale coffee and burnt toast hung in the air, an unwelcome companion to the symphony of thunder booming from the storm's fury.  Amelia, her chin resting on a worn copy of "The Thin Man," sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. 

She’d been working on this case for three weeks now – a dead-end alley, a cryptic note with an obscene amount of red lipstick drawn on it (the victim's last known lover), and a client who looked like he hadn't slept since the Great Depression.  His name was Reginald Beaumont, a man whose wealth and questionable reputation were whispered about in hushed tones amongst the city’s elite. 

"You gonna take this case or what?" His voice boomed from behind Amelia, startling her slightly. The heavy frame of the door revealed his imposing figure – a world away from the bookish demeanor she'd grown accustomed to. He wore an expensive suit that seemed almost incongruous with the grimy streets outside, and a pair of steel-blue eyes that reflected the storm raging within him. 

The setting was Gotham City, a sprawling metropolis built upon shadows and secrets - a place where hope was often buried beneath a thick layer of smog and the promise of something much more sinister than good intentions.  This was Amelia's playground, her stage for solving the city's most intricate mysteries. It was a place she wouldn’t trade for anything in the world – not even for another cup of coffee.


**What kind of mystery is this case?**
