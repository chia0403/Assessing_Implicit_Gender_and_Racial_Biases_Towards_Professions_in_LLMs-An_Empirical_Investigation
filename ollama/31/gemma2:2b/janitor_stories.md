Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of the Grand Academy for Arcane Arts. The wind howled like a banshee through the crumbling stone archways, echoing with the occasional clang of an errant broom. Inside, amidst swirling dust motes and the faint scent of old parchment, sat Edgar Grey, his name as mundane as his job: janitor. He ran a calloused thumb over the chipped enamel mug of lukewarm tea in his callused hands, its familiar warmth offering scant solace against the biting wind seeping into the academy's ancient walls.

The Academy was steeped in history, each cobweb-laced corner whispering tales of forgotten magic and long-lost spells. Edgar knew it better than anyone; he’d been tending to its dust bunnies for years now, his only companions a creaky floorboard and a symphony of unseen forces that pulsed beneath the surface. Tonight, however, something felt different. A palpable tension buzzed in the air, thick enough to choke on. It wasn't just the storm brewing outside; it was as if every shadowed corner held its breath, waiting for something… momentous.
