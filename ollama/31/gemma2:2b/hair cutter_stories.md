Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "The Shear Delight," an old Victorian salon tucked away on a quiet side street in Salem. Inside, Elara Hawthorne, known by most as Ellie, deftly snipped the unruly curls from Mrs. Peabody's head while humming a melancholic tune. The air hung thick with the scent of chamomile and lavender hair oil - a familiar mix that both comforted and unsettled her. 

Ellie’s gaze drifted towards the vintage photographs that adorned the salon walls. Each one depicted a different era, capturing the changing face of Salem and its people – from grand Victorian portraits to black-and-white snapshots of the city's post-war recovery. Yet, none truly captured what she felt inside. The weight of her family’s legacy, a lineage steeped in generations of hairdressers known for their unmatched craft, seemed to be crushing her under the weight of expectations.

The chime of the salon door broke her reverie. A young man stood awkwardly at the entrance, his face obscured by the downpour. He was dressed in the kind of attire that could belong anywhere, yet a distinct air of nervousness emanated from him. Ellie couldn't help but feel the tug of curiosity. It wasn't often that a customer walked through the door without a prearranged appointment. 

"Welcome to The Shear Delight," she chirped, her usual warmth tinged with an unexpected sense of urgency. "I see you're wet as a frog."
