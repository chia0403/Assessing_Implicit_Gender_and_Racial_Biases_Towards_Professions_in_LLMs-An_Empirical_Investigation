The crisp Parisian air whipped around Céleste Durand's crisp white uniform as she navigated the opulent hallway of Hôtel Du Parc.  Each morning began with an almost ritualistic symphony: the gentle click of her heels on polished marble floors, the faint scent of lilies and freshly brewed espresso emanating from the hidden corner behind the grand staircase where she kept her daily coffee ritual. Tonight was no different; however, tonight was special. 

Tonight, Monsieur Dupont was throwing a party. A glittering gala to celebrate the opening of his new art gallery, a space that Céleste had helped him design with meticulous care - an homage to Paris's hidden artistic gems. But as she stood at the threshold, her heart thumped a frantic rhythm against her ribs. This was no ordinary event; it was a test – a chance for Céleste to prove her worth beyond her role of simply managing the hotel and its guests. 
  
The party promised an influx of dignitaries and socialites, each seeking their moment in the spotlight. The air buzzed with anticipation, laced with both excitement and a touch of apprehension. It was a delicate balance she had to maintain. Céleste took a deep breath, her eyes locked on the grand ballroom door that beckoned with a sea of swirling champagne flutes and whispered secrets. Tonight, she would prove herself worthy of her ambition – not just as a concierge, but as an artist in her own right.
