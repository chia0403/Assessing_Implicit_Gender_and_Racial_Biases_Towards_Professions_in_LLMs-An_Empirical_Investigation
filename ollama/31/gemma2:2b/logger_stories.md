Rain hammered against the canvas tarpaulin stretched taut over his small cabin, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser that hissed away into the damp wooden floorboards.  Inside, Silas Blackwood, known to most as "Black" by the men he felled, rubbed his tired eyes and stared out at the swirling grey tapestry of the forest on the edge of their logging district. The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and decay, a familiar comfort in this life, but tonight it carried an undercurrent of something else: worry. 

Silas ran his callused fingers over the worn leather strap of his axe, its blade catching the dim glow of the kerosene lamp on his workbench. Tonight, he wasn't chopping through towering firs or hauling logs for a timber company; tonight was different.  He was heading out with his son, Caleb, to clear a path for their new venture - a small-scale woodturning operation they hoped would become something more. Their father had always encouraged them to build something of their own, and Silas felt a pang of guilt as he pictured his old man's face in the twilight light that stretched over the forest. 

The storm raged on outside, mirroring the growing tempest within him - a fear for his sonâ€™s safety, the pressure of an uncertain future, and a deep-seated longing to find some sort of peace within this life he knew so well.  It wasn't just the rain battering the cabin; it was the rain washing away any semblance of hope that Silas had clung onto for years - an impossible hope that one day his son would find true happiness beyond the shadow of their family legacy.
