The Grand Astoria Hotel shimmered under a moonless Chicago sky, its towering fa√ßade casting long shadows against the slick asphalt street. Inside, **Mr. Alistair Bellington III**,  a bellhop with more weariness in his eyes than a seasoned sailor's beard, struggled to lug heavy luggage through the echoing lobby. Each step seemed to echo through the cavernous space, punctuated only by the tired clack of his leather suitcase on polished marble floors. 

Chicago was usually alive with a kind of relentless energy that thrummed against your ears and buzzed in your soul like a city symphony. But tonight, even the usual symphony of sirens felt muted, as if a thick layer of melancholy had settled upon the city's heart.  Mr. Bellington knew why - tonight was the night of the unveiling of the "Ghostly" Suite, an exclusive suite rumored to be haunted by the very souls of its previous occupants. The whispers were enough to make any sane man sleep with his eyes open and his suitcase locked tight. Mr. Bellington wasn't sure if he was brave or foolish for taking this gig tonight.
