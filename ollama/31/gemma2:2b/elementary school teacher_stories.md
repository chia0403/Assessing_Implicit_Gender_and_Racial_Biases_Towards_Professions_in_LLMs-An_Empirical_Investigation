The humid air hung heavy in Ms. Amelia Hawthorne's fifth-grade classroom, clinging to the walls like an unwelcome guest. Sunlight filtered weakly through the leaves of the ancient oak tree outside her window, casting the room in a dim, dappled glow. The aroma of crayons and forgotten lunchboxes lingered in the air, a familiar scent that both comforted and unsettled Ms. Hawthorne on this particular afternoon.  

It was always quiet before school started, even more so than usual. It felt like a vacuum had sucked the energy out of everyone – even the usually enthusiastic students.  Her class of 25 wide-eyed pupils would soon fill her space with the cacophony she loved, but for now, silence reigned, making Ms. Hawthorne feel like an island surrounded by empty sea. She glanced at her watch and sighed, wondering if this was a sign of things to come.

The bell rang, jolting the room back into action as the children burst through the door with their usual frenetic energy. Ms. Hawthorne smiled, knowing that even amidst the chaos, her classroom would become a haven of learning and laughter –  but for now, she just needed a moment to breathe before welcoming them all in.
