Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Harding's small private practice in rural Vermont. The storm had been raging for three days, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Amy, usually calm and collected with an aura of quiet strength, felt raw. A recent patient, a young woman named Emily whose leg was fractured from a skiing accident, had refused physical therapy despite assurances from the hospital that it was essential for healing.  Emily's father, who insisted on traditional medicine, scoffed at Amy’s expertise, and her mother, trapped in a cycle of guilt and helplessness, only added to Amy's frustration. 

The weight of these conflicting emotions pressed down on Amy as she stared out the rain-streaked window. She was surrounded by bookshelves crammed with anatomical charts and massage textbooks, yet this case felt different; a tangible sense of isolation hung heavy in the air. This rural town wasn't exactly known for its open-mindedness about alternative healing practices.  Amy closed her eyes, trying to clear her head as she began to meticulously arrange the medical tools on her counter.  A single line from Emily’s mother echoed through her mind: "She just doesn't believe..."  

Amy knew then that she needed something more than just treatment; she needed a bridge between two worlds, and fast. 


**Setting:** Amy's small private practice is located in a quaint village nestled at the foot of Vermont mountains, with the town's library offering a warm haven for her patients during the storm.
