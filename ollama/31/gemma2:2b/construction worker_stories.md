The wind whipped off the bay, carrying with it the salty tang of sea spray and the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead.  It had been a week since Lucas “Lucky” Delaney last saw his wife's smile – or even her face, for that matter. A steel beam groaned under the strain of the crane, sending a tremor through the foundations of the new marina as it rose from the earth. Lucky was used to the rumble of machinery and the symphony of clanging metal; but this new project held a different kind of weight.

The construction site on the edge of Newport Bay was a bustling hive of activity, a microcosm of life itself: sun-bleached faces pressed against windows as they gazed at their steel masterpieces, laughter echoing through the air as men swapped jokes and stories in the shade of the cranes. Lucky stood there, his worn leather work boots sinking into the dust, watching it all unfold. His hands were calloused, rough and scarred from years spent swinging hammers and welding steel – a lifetime dedicated to building something tangible, something real. 

His gaze lingered on a single empty chair across the site's makeshift lunch area. A chair that was meant for his wife, Maya Delaney. The one he promised to fill with stories of their new life in this little corner of America they were slowly building together.
