The air in Aelrin's barracks was thick with the scent of damp wood and stale ale. He coughed, his throat burning from the smoke-stained drafts that whipped through the building. Outside, the night clung to the city walls like a shroud, its silence broken only by the rhythmic thudding of distant drums echoing from the training yard. Aelrin, known to the townsfolk as "Ironhand" for the calluses on his fingers and the stoicism etched onto his face, pulled his worn cloak tighter around him, battling against the icy wind whipping down from the mountain peaks.

His name was not Ironhand alone – it was a title bestowed upon him by an old sailor who'd lost his wife to the harbor's treacherous tides. He'd learned to wield his hammer with the same fierce spirit as that weathered man and, in turn, had become known for his unwavering resolve within the city walls. Tonight, however, Aelrin’s heart was a heavy weight beneath his ribs – not from fear of the night's dangers but from the knowledge that his shift had begun. The silence wasn't natural tonight; it held an undercurrent of dread.
