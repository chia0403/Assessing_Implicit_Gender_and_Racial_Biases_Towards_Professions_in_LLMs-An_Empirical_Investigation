## The Forgotten Sanctuary

**Setting:**  A dilapidated, overgrown sanctuary nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains. Wind rustles through dead branches and whispers secrets through the once vibrant leaves. Rain falls heavy on the tin roof of the abandoned administration building, drumming a somber rhythm that echoes Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's melancholic heart. 

**Character:** Amy Hawthorne, her hands calloused from years of caring for wild animals, was the last caretaker left in the place. The sanctuary was once teeming with rescued creatures - foxes, owls, deer, and even the occasional mountain lion – now only a symphony of silence echoed through the crumbling stone walls.  The air hung thick with memories, both joyful and mournful, each one a poignant echo of Amy’s life-long dedication to these forgotten souls. 

**Opening:**  "Sometimes," she whispered to an empty kennel as she swept the remnants of days-old birdseed off the floor, "I wonder if anyone's even listening anymore." The weight of years and the quiet solitude were heavy on Amy's shoulders. She yearned for the bustle of feeding time, the playful barks of dogs, the chirping chorus of birds – but a persistent silence had settled over the sanctuary like a blanket woven from forgotten dreams. 

A flicker of movement in the distance caught her eye - a rustle in the overgrown rose garden. Was it a stray cat? A squirrel? She approached cautiously, heart thudding against her ribs, only to see an enormous shadow flitting between the thorns – a creature bigger than she had ever imagined. Its amber eyes glinted with curiosity as it stared at Amy with an almost human intelligence.
