The air in the cab of his rig, the "Iron Maiden," was thick with the weight of miles driven and dreams half-fulfilled.  He called himself Jasper Thornton, but even to himself, the nickname felt forced, too much like an afterthought. On the vast expanse of Interstate 80, where asphalt stretched endlessly under a sky bruised with storm clouds, he felt adrift, a lone voyager navigating the currents of fate. The setting sun cast long shadows across the endless ribbon of highway as Jasper pulled into the desolate rest stop, the hum of diesel engines and lonely chatter echoing through the cavernous structure. 

He knew this was just another pitstop in his never-ending trek from Chicago to California. It wasn't about the destination â€“ it was about the journey itself; about the miles logged, the stories heard, the faces glimpsed fleetingly on highway overpasses.  Jasper needed a break, not from the endless asphalt but from the weight of loneliness that clung to him like a second skin. The promise of greasy fries and lukewarm coffee lay before him, an empty solace in this otherwise empty world.
