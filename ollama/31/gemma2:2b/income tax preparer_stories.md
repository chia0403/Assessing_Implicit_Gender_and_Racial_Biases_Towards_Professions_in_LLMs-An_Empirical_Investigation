The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Peterson's head like tired cicadas. The air in her cramped, cluttered office was thick with a cocktail of stale coffee, peppermint oil for stress relief (which mostly just seemed to make the paper clips dance), and last week's forgotten tuna casserole. It was the kind of place where dreams went to die, she thought wryly, surrounded by reams of tax forms, her trusty calculator beeping in rhythmic cadence. 

Amy sighed, picking up a particularly troublesome W-2 form with its illegible handwriting and missing decimal point. She was about to call the client again when a loud crash from the hallway interrupted her daydream of escaping this tiny purgatory. 

"Is that you again, Mr. Henderson?" Amy muttered under her breath, pushing back a stray curl as she braced herself for another year-end financial meltdown.  


**Setting:** A small accounting office in a quiet suburban neighborhood. The space is filled with tax forms, calculators, and stacks of manila folders, reflecting the mundane nature of tax season. 

**Character:** Amy Peterson, an income tax preparer, who feels trapped by her work but yearns for something more meaningful.
