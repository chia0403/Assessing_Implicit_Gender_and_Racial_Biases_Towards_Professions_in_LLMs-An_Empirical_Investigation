Rain hammered against the warped wood of the old station like tiny fists trying to break down its weathered bones. Inside, Firefighter Liam O'Connell meticulously checked the pressure gauge on his helmet, a familiar ritual before heading out into the storm. The air in the cramped locker room was thick with diesel fuel and lingering tension – the kind that only comes from hours of responding to calls with escalating emergencies. 

Liam felt his own pulse thrum against his teeth as he tightened the straps of his turnout gear, the icy wind whistling down the hallway. It wasn't just the storm, it was the weight of every call they’d dealt with this year. The car crash that claimed a young couple; the burning bakery that trapped an elderly woman; the inferno in the abandoned factory that took the lives of two firefighters trying to save others.  They were fighting their way through a constant barrage of emergencies, each one leaving its scars on them like old battle wounds.
