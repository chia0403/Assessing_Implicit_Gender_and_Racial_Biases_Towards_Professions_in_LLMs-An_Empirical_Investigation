## Story Opening:

Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's chest. She stared out at the blurred cityscape, each gust of wind sending another cascade of droplets cascading down the glass. It was just like the day she’d started this clinic – a flurry of chaotic beginnings.  The air inside was thick with disinfectant and the earthy smell of recycled wood from the old building Amy had chosen to breathe life into. 

The city's grit, visible in the grime clinging to every corner of her workspace, was a stark contrast to the carefully curated order she felt within herself. Amy wasn’t just an occupational therapist – she was a conduit for resilience. A beacon of hope for patients battling physical and emotional limitations. This small clinic on Elm Street was her haven, but it also held the weight of the entire city's struggles.

**Setting:** A dilapidated yet charming building nestled on a quiet corner of Elm Street in an industrial part of Chicago. The storefront has been transformed into a welcoming space with exposed brick, repurposed furniture and playful pops of color amidst the beige walls.  It houses a small group of patients from various walks of life – from struggling single mothers to injured war veterans.


**Character:** Amy Hawthorne, a dedicated occupational therapist who sees beyond the physical limitations of her patients. She is driven by empathy and possesses an innate ability to connect with individuals on both intellectual and emotional levels, fostering their independence and resilience amidst life's obstacles.
