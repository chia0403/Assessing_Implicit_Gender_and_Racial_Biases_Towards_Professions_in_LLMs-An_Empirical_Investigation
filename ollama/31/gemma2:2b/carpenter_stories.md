The rain hammered against the wooden shingles of Thomas Blackwood's workshop like the beat of a frantic heart. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song through the ancient oak trees lining Willow Street, a tune that echoed deep within the hollow of his own soul. It was the kind of night that whispered secrets and made shadows stretch long across the floorboards. Inside, Thomas, known by every resident on the street for his sturdy craftsmanship and even stronger handshake, hunched over his workbench.  

He'd been working on a new design: an intricately carved wooden birdcage, its ornate curves meant to house not just caged birds, but also hope – a delicate balance between beauty and fragility. It was a project he’d been contemplating for weeks, ever since the tragic passing of Mrs. Peabody, his neighbor and a frequent customer with a kind smile and eyes that held the warmth of her freshly baked apple pie.  He had promised to complete her prized birdcage, its intricate design meant to mimic the soaring elegance of an eagle, before he left for the mainland, where work was scarce and opportunities even scarcer. 

The weight of his grief pressed down on Thomas like a thick fog. Yet, he needed this cage to move forward. To heal. To find some semblance of peace in the storm that raged not just outside but within.
