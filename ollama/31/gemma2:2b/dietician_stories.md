##  The Taste of Regret 

**Setting:** A bustling city street corner in Prague, Czech Republic. Cobblestones were worn smooth by time and footsteps, sunlight filtering down through the leaves of ancient oak trees. The air hung thick with the scent of roasted nuts and sweet gingerbread, a symphony orchestrated by vendors hawking their wares.  

**Character:**  Dr. Emilia Kozlova, a highly respected dietician known for her warm demeanor and dedication to holistic health. Her life had been meticulously structured around good food, exercise, and meaningful work. Yet, today, the city’s vibrant chaos felt suffocating. 

Emilia was standing on the very corner where she'd first met her husband, Anton.  He hadn't made it.  His smile, his laugh, now just a fading echo in her mind. She clutched the worn photo of him – a young man with a mischievous glint in his eye and a hand outstretched towards a plate piled high with goulash – as if she could conjure up the warmth he once brought to her life.  

A sudden gust of wind sent a swirling dance of leaves into the air, each one whispering a silent lament for Anton. Emilia's stomach clenched. Her work at the Prague clinic was no longer just about nutrition; it felt like a battle against time and grief itself.
