The flickering neon sign above the "Sunrise Diner" cast an oily sheen over Amelia Thorne's face as she stepped inside.  A symphony of clangs, grinds, and hushed voices greeted her, each sound amplified by the thick fog that seemed to cling to the air like a damp shroud. 1:30 AM was a time reserved for whispers and shadows in this sleepy town, a place where secrets festered deeper than the grease stains on the booths. The only light came from the cracked neon logo and a handful of flickering fluorescent bulbs hanging precariously from the ceiling.  Amelia adjusted her worn stethoscope around her neck, taking a moment to calm her racing heartbeat before joining the other nurses who were seemingly gathered for an illicit meeting in the back booth.
