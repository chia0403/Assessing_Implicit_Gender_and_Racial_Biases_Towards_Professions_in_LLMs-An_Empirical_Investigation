The aroma of fresh-baked bread hung thick in the air, mingling with the tang of old wood and the distant hum of the nearby train station. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows of "Delia's Delights," illuminating flour dusting Amelia Delacroix's apron as she kneaded dough with practiced ease. It was her father's shop, his bakery a small but cherished monument in their quiet French village of Mont-Saint-Pierre.

Amelia had inherited more than just the recipes and ovens; she'd inherited her father's stubborn streak and an unyielding love for tradition. Every morning, she woke before dawn to fire up the ovens and knead the sourdough that was the heart of her family's legacy.  The town loved her croissants, their flaky layers yielding to a touch of sweetness, and the pain au chocolat, each bite bursting with molten chocolate, but today felt different - an air of anticipation settled over her as she glanced towards the train station entrance. A passenger had entered who seemed out of place, his dark suit incongruously clashing with the quaint charm of the village.  A storm brewed outside, mirroring the unease brewing within Amelia's heart.
