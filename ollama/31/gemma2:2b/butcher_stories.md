The air in "Gristle & Grind" hung thick with the scent of cured meats and lingering smoke, as familiar to Bartholomew “Bart” Hawthorne as his own reflection. For years, he'd stood behind the counter of his father’s butcher shop, the rough-hewn wood a comfort against the harsh city grime that seeped in from the streets.  The aroma of aged stock was a constant, comforting presence, mingling with the sharp tang of freshly ground peppercorns and the metallic scent of blood – all as essential to Bart's world as the air he breathed.

But the scent had grown stale lately. His father’s passing, a silent farewell shrouded in the same quiet sadness that settled over the city after every storm, left a void not easily filled. He could hear his father’s voice in the rhythmic scrape of the cleaver against bone, even now, echoing through Bart's mind as he meticulously sliced a slab of roast beef.  He yearned for something more than the familiar rhythm, something to fill the aching space where his father's presence used to be. 

It was this yearning that brought about a daring proposition; one that would test not only his skill but his spirit: Bart wanted to start his own butcher shop. One that wouldn’t just sell meat, but tell stories of the animals he slaughtered – crafting them into something more than just sustenance.  He cradled a worn leather-bound notebook in his hands, its pages filled with sketches and a detailed plan for "Hawthorne's Harvest," a venture promising both artistry and culinary ingenuity. 

The shop’s front door creaked open, ushering in a gust of wind that carried the distinct scent of rain and an unknown woman.  Her face was shrouded by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat, her eyes like polished jet, watching him with an air of quiet determination. Bart's heart quickened, his gut twisting with a sudden premonition. He knew this woman held something important – or maybe, someone important - and he wasn’t prepared to let that slip away.
