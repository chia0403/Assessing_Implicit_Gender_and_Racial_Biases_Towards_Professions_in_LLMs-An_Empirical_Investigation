## The Whisperer's House

The scent of lavender and rosemary clung to Amelia’s worn apron like an old friend. It was a familiar comfort, a silent promise of order in the chaos that lay before her.  Her hands moved with practiced ease, smoothing down the wrinkles on the velvet curtains, each stroke deliberate and precise as she navigated the stately, yet dusty, expanse of Mrs. Evers's home. 

**Amelia Everly**, known to some as "The Whisperer" for the gentle way her voice seemed to weave through the grand house like a soft breeze, was more than just a housekeeper.  She held the rhythm of this mansion’s life in her hands – she kept the floors polished, coaxed the roses into bloom, and tended to the secrets whispered in every creak and groan. 

But tonight felt different. A strange tension hummed beneath Mrs. Evers' usual cheerful chatter. The usually vibrant hues were dulled, even the silver candles seemed to cast deeper shadows, as if reflecting something dark and hidden within the house's own walls.   As Amelia stood at the grand oak staircase, the silence seemed to press down on her chest, each tick of the grandfather clock echoing with an unsettling finality.
