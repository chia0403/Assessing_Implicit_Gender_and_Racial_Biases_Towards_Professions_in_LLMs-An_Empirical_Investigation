Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Finch's clinic, mimicking the relentless thrumming in her chest.  The scent of disinfectant mingled with the cloying aroma of wet fur - a familiar olfactory cocktail for a woman who dedicated her life to easing animal suffering. Inside, the usual symphony of chirps and squeaks was drowned out by the howling storm outside. Amelia sighed, pulling her worn stethoscope over her collar. It wasn't just the weather that brought on this melancholic mood; it was her latest patient.

The old Labrador, Rex, had arrived with a limp that betrayed his otherwise jovial demeanour.  He seemed to be bearing the weight of more than just a sprained ankle - Amelia sensed a weariness in him, a kind of resignation she'd seen before in countless senior pets on their last legs. The clinic's small waiting room was usually bustling with concerned owners and excited puppies, but today it felt like a mausoleum, mirroring Rex's own fading spirit. 

The storm outside mirrored the turmoil within Amelia as she examined Rex's limping gait and assessed his condition.  Amelia Finch, DVM, knew this wasn't just an ordinary vet visit; it was a battle against time, a fight to hold back the inevitable - the final curtain call of life for her beloved canine patients.
