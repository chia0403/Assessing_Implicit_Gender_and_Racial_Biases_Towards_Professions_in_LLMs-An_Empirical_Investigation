## Story Opening: 

The morning mist clung to the ancient oak trees like ghostly shrouds, their gnarled branches heavy with dew.  A chill wind whipped through the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor, rustling the leaves and sending shivers down **Reginald "Reg" Thorne's** spine. He adjusted his battered cap and pulled his threadbare coat tighter around him, squinting at the sky that was already turning a sickly shade of grey. A storm, brewing with malevolence, was rolling in from the east. 

Blackwood Manor had always been a place of secrets.  Reg, its groundskeeper for nearly three decades, knew more about its hidden history than most. Tales of lost love, stolen fortunes, and dark whispers lingered on the wind, echoing through the decaying grandeur of the mansion. The old manor's charm was offset by a creeping sense of unease that clung to Reg like the damp fog.

He felt it in his bones – something wasn’t right.  The normally vibrant grounds seemed oddly still, like the very air held its breath. A prickling sensation crawled across his skin, warning him that something sinister was about to unfold, and he couldn't quite put his finger on what it might be. 


## Setting:

* **Blackwood Manor:** An imposing, gothic mansion nestled amongst rolling hills in rural England.  It's a place of sprawling lawns, overgrown paths, and crumbling stone walls that whisper tales of forgotten glory and hidden tragedy.
* **The Grounds:**  A world unto itself.  Ancient oaks loom over moss-covered pathways, while wisteria climbs ivy-clad walls like an unruly lover.  Hidden corners hold secrets: a mossy grotto with whispers in the wind, and a crumbling well shrouded in legend.
