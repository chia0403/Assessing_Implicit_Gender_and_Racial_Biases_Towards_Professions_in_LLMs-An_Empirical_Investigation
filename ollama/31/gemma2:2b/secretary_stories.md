Time seemed to stand still within its walls, each echoing sound amplified by the silence that clung to Amelia like a shadow.  Each day she meticulously typed out letters and reports for Mr. Hawthorne, her boss, who had inherited the estate from his eccentric uncle. 

While the manor whispered tales of forgotten grandeur and hidden secrets, Amelia found herself consumed with a yearning for something more. The weight of years in this gilded cage felt heavier than she could bear. It was here that Amelia began to see her life as a story waiting to be written.
