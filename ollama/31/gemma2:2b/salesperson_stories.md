The air hung thick and stagnant in the cramped office, punctuated by the rhythmic clacking of Amelia's keyboard. Sunlight slanted through a grime-stained window onto the worn leather of her desk chair, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. Outside, the city thrummed with the usual frenetic energy, but inside Amelia felt as trapped as a moth in amber. It was 3:00 PM on Tuesday, and she hadn't secured a single sale all day.

Amelia "Amy" Bellington was no stranger to sales. She had a natural knack for reading people, their anxieties and desires, and her years at the family-owned furniture store had honed her into an expert negotiator.  But this week, the usual buzz of anticipation before closing time had been replaced by a gnawing anxiety that seemed determined to suffocate her. It was as if everyone in the city, from the high-rise executives to the everyday folks shuffling past her shop, held their breath for somethingâ€¦ unknown. 

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the scent of cedar and polished mahogany, a familiar cocktail that usually fueled her drive. Now, though, even the fragrance seemed muted, its warmth replaced by an icy chill.  Her gaze drifted towards the old framed family photo on her desk, depicting Amy as a young girl standing proudly beside her father in front of a grand Victorian sofa. A small smile touched her lips. This wasn't just a store; it was a legacy, built over generations with each piece telling a story.  But tonight, that legacy felt far from secure.
