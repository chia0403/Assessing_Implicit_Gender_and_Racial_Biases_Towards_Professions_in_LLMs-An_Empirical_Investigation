The air hung thick and heavy in the Louisiana humidity, each breath carrying the scent of diesel fuel and pine needles from the trees lining the highway. A haze of dust clung to everything â€“ the asphalt itself, the worn-out orange vests of the other workers, even the reflection of the setting sun off the blacktop. It was a scene as familiar as breathing for 35-year-old Ethan "Hawkeye" Pierce, who had been hauling his lunch pail across this stretch of I-10 for the past ten years. His back ached from hours spent bending over to tighten bolts on the old guardrails, and his weathered hands were sore from gripping the wrench that felt more like an extension of himself than just a tool. 

He squinted at the sun dipping below the horizon, its fiery orange glow painting the sky in streaks of crimson and gold. His eyes settled on a lone oak tree, its gnarled branches casting long, dark shadows against the fading light. In those shadows, Hawkeye noticed something move. A flicker of movement, barely perceptible amidst the swaying leaves and the gentle breeze. He tightened his grip on his wrench, a familiar unease creeping up his spine as he watched, waiting for the figure to emerge from the darkness.
