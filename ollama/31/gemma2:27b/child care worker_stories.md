Rain lashed against the windows of the Tiny Toes daycare, blurring the vibrant murals depicting whimsical woodland creatures. The insistent drumming was a familiar soundtrack to Elara Blackwood's mornings. She hummed along, pushing back a stray curl from her freckled forehead as she set out bowls of oatmeal topped with juicy strawberries.

The aroma of cinnamon and sweet berries hung in the air, momentarily masking the faint smell of disinfectant that clung perpetually to the brightly colored playroom. Outside, the wind howled like a hungry wolf, but inside Tiny Toes, warmth radiated from the cheerfully decorated walls and the playful shrieks of the children already starting their day.  


Elara smiled. This was her haven, a world of finger paints and boundless imagination where the biggest worry was a spilled cup of juice or a lost teddy bear. She loved seeing the world through the wide eyes of these tiny humans, reminding herself of the simple joys she often forgot in her own life. Today, though, a nagging unease tugged at the edges of Elara's contentment. Something felt off, a subtle shift in the familiar rhythm of the daycare.
