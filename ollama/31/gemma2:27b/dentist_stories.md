The incessant whirring of the drill filled Dr. Eleanor Cavendish's ears, a familiar symphony that had become both comfort and curse over her fifteen years in practice. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint metallic tang of blood, another constant in her world. Sunlight streamed through the large window overlooking Elm Street, dappling the polished linoleum floor of her office. Outside, the autumn wind rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel before her building, a silent witness to the dramas unfolding within. 

Eleanor paused, setting down the drill and wiping sweat from her brow. Her patient, Mrs. Henderson, a kindly woman with a penchant for lemon drops, winced slightly. "Almost done, dear," Eleanor reassured her, her voice soothing as she picked up a small mirror. "Just need to polish this filling and you'll be good as new."

But even as she spoke the words, a shiver ran down Eleanor's spine. Something felt off. A prickling unease, like a tiny burr lodged beneath her skin.  It wasn't unusual for patients to experience anxiety during procedures, but this felt different. It was a palpable tension in the air, an unspoken dread that seeped into the room despite Mrs. Henderson's brave smile.
