The midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the dusty baseball field. Sweat beaded on Eleanor "Ellie" Cartwright's forehead as she surveyed her team, a ragtag bunch of preteens with mismatched uniforms and varying levels of enthusiasm.

The rusted bleachers were mostly empty, save for Mrs. Henderson, Ellie's ever-supportive grandmother, who sat perched on the edge, knitting needles clicking rhythmically. 

Ellie sighed. Coaching the Pinewood Pioneers wasn’t exactly what she’d envisioned when she returned to her hometown after college. She'd dreamt of a prestigious coaching position at a renowned university, not wrangling a bunch of kids who seemed more interested in catching grasshoppers than hitting home runs. But life rarely followed the script, and here Ellie was, determined to make the best of it.
