Rain lashed against the windows of St. Anne's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already faded autumn colors outside. Inside, Amelia Rose Carrington, OT, adjusted her spectacles and sighed. Her patient, Mrs. Hawthorne, was having a particularly stubborn day. The once vibrant artist, now confined to a wheelchair due to a stroke, refused to even attempt picking up the paintbrush Amelia had carefully laid on the table before her.

"It's no use, dearie," Mrs. Hawthorne rasped, her voice thin and brittle like dried leaves. "My hand, it just won't obey."  She looked at the vibrant acrylics spread across the table with a mixture of longing and despair. 


The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of lavender from Amelia's hand sanitizer, creating a familiar yet melancholy atmosphere in the small therapy room. Outside, the wind howled like a mournful spirit, mirroring the ache in Amelia's heart for her patient. She knew Mrs. Hawthorne yearned to paint again, but the stroke had stolen not only her mobility but also part of her confidence. Amelia was determined to help her reclaim both.
