Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Finnigan's workshop, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the silence. The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and burnt solder, a familiar comfort to Elias. He hunched over a tangle of wires, his brow furrowed in concentration as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn connection. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel by the workshop door into a frenzy.

Elias, with his calloused hands and wire-thin frame, seemed dwarfed by the hulking workbench before him.  His greying hair was plastered to his forehead, and his eyes, magnified by thick spectacles, darted back and forth between the schematic diagram pinned to the wall and the intricate web of wires he was trying to tame. He muttered under his breath, a stream of technical jargon punctuated by frustrated sighs.

Tonight was a bad night for a power outage, Elias thought grimly. The storm had knocked out electricity across half the town, leaving residents in darkness and clutching at their flickering candles. And it was his job to bring the light back on.
