Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of the derelict warehouse, mimicking the hammering in Eliza Marie Davenport’s chest. The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and rust, punctuated by the occasional metallic tang she couldn't quite place.  Eliza shifted her weight on the creaky wooden crate she was perched upon, trying to get a better angle on the flickering neon sign casting an eerie green glow across the dusty concrete floor.

"The Siren's Call," it proclaimed in faded, spidery script, its promise of cheap thrills and illicit pleasures now tinged with a morbid sense of irony. This wasn't Eliza's usual beat – political scandals and corporate malfeasance were more her forte. But when whispers of a missing journalist and rumours of a shadowy underworld operation reached her ears, she couldn't resist the pull of the unknown.


This was it: the last known location of Daniel Hayes, the reporter who had vanished without a trace three weeks ago. His final article, hinting at corruption within the city's police force, had been abruptly pulled from publication.  Eliza gripped her notepad tighter, her fingers numb with cold and anticipation.

She wasn’t sure what she expected to find in this crumbling husk of a building, but something told her Daniel Hayes' story was far from over.
