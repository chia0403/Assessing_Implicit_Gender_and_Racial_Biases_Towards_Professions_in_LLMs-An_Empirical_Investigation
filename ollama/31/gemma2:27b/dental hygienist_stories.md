Rain lashed against the windows of Smile Bright Dental, blurring the cheerful cartoon tooth on the sign outside.  Inside, Eloise Carmichael sighed, her breath fogging the surface of the stainless steel tray beside her. Another Tuesday afternoon, and another onslaught of patients with gingivitis, cavities, and a healthy dose of dental anxiety. 

Eloise had always dreamt of being an artist, but life, as it often did, had other plans. Dental hygiene offered stability, a decent salary, and the chance to help people, even if that help rarely involved creating something beautiful. Still, she tried to inject some creativity into her work – humming whimsical melodies while polishing teeth, crafting intricate origami cranes from discarded floss picks, and always remembering a patient's preferred toothpaste flavor.

Today, however, even Eloise’s usual enthusiasm was dampened by the dreary weather. Then, the door to room three swung open, revealing a young man with wild, curly hair and eyes that sparkled like amethysts. He seemed both nervous and excited, clutching a worn leather satchel close to his chest.

“Eloise Carmichael?” he asked, his voice tinged with an accent she couldn’t quite place. “I believe I have an appointment.”
