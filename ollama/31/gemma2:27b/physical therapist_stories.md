Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the clinic, blurring the neon sign outside that read "Hope Springs Physical Therapy." Inside, Amelia Cartwright adjusted her spectacles and sighed, watching a particularly stubborn knot in Mr. Henderson's shoulder refuse to budge. He winced as she applied pressure, muttering something about "blasted arthritis" under his breath. 

Amelia sympathized, truly she did.  At thirty-two, her own body was starting to creak like an old floorboard. Years of pushing and pulling, stretching and strengthening had taken their toll. Yet, she wouldn't trade it for the world. Helping people reclaim their mobility, witnessing that spark of hope ignite in their eyes when they finally managed a step they thought impossible - that was what kept her going, even on days like this when the rain felt as relentless as Mr. Henderson's pain.
