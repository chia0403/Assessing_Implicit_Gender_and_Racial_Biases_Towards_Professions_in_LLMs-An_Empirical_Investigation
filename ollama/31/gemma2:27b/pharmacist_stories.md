Rain lashed against the apothecary window, blurring the quaint facade of "The Elixir Emporium" into an impressionist painting. The scent of chamomile and lavender, usually a comforting aroma, seemed to struggle against the damp, earthy smell creeping in from the storm-soaked cobblestones outside. Eleanor Blackwood, her silver hair pulled back in a severe bun, adjusted her spectacles and peered at the clock ticking impatiently on the wall. It was well past closing time, yet another dreary Wednesday mirroring the endless stream of them she'd endured since her husband, George, had passed away three months prior.

Eleanor missed him terribly. His booming laughter used to fill the small shop, blending with the clinking of vials and the rhythmic grinding of herbs. Now, the silence was broken only by the persistent drumming of rain and the occasional sigh escaping Eleanor's lips. She longed for a customer, any customer, to break the monotony and remind her that she wasn't alone.
