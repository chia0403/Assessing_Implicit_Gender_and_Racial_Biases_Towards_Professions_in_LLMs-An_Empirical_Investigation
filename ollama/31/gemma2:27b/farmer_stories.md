The rooster's crow was swallowed whole by the relentless wind whipping across Silas Bartholomew's wheat field. He squinted at the horizon, a bruised canvas of greys and sickly yellows threatening to unleash another torrent. The past weeks had been a cruel dance of sun and storm, each day leaving his fields in a state of precarious recovery.  

Silas tugged his threadbare hat lower, shielding his weathered face from the biting gusts. His calloused hands, knotted like ancient roots, clenched around the worn handle of his hoe. He surveyed the rows of young wheat stalks, already bent and battered by the unforgiving wind. Each gust felt like a gamble, threatening to tear them from the earth before they had a chance to mature.  

A shiver ran down Silas's spine, unrelated to the cold. This wasn't just another storm brewing; it was something deeper, a disquiet that settled in his bones like a chill wind from the north. He couldn't explain it, but he knew this year would be different.
