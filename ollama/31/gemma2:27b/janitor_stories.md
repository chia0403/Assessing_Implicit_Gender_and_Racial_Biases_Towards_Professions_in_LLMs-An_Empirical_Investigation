The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a dissonant symphony as Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins mopped the linoleum floor of the Grand Blackwood Library's main reading room. Dust motes danced in the pale yellow glow, swirling around towering shelves laden with ancient leather-bound tomes and forgotten histories. The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and beeswax polish, a comforting aroma Bart had grown accustomed to over his twenty years of service. 

Outside, the city throbbed with late-night energy; car horns blared, distant sirens wailed, and laughter spilled from overflowing bars. But within the library's hushed walls, time seemed to stand still, a sanctuary for knowledge and forgotten dreams. Bart, usually content in his solitude amongst the silent stacks, felt a strange unease tonight.
