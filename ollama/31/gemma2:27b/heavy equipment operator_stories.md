The pre-dawn air hung thick with the smell of diesel and damp earth.  A thin veil of fog clung to the valley floor, obscuring the distant mountains.  Jasper "Jazz" Delaney squinted through the gloom, his calloused hand adjusting the brim of his well-worn Stetson. He climbed into the cab of his Caterpillar 349 excavator, the familiar whine of hydraulics a comforting sound in the stillness.

The site stretched before him â€“ a sprawling expanse of red earth soon to be transformed into the foundation for a new shopping mall. Jazz wasn't sentimental about such things; buildings rose and fell, progress marched on. But there was a certain poetry in wielding a machine that could move mountains, albeit one cubic yard at a time.
