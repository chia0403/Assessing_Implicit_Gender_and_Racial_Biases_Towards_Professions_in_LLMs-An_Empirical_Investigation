The sun beat down on the cracked tarmac, radiating heat that shimmered off Captain Amelia "Ace" Rodriguez's dusty flight suit. Her calloused fingers tightened around the worn leather of her flight helmet as she surveyed the desolate airstrip. This wasn't exactly the glamorous world of international travel and luxury jets that she'd dreamed of as a kid.  

This was the Dust Bowl, a forgotten corner of Arizona where tumbleweeds outnumbered cacti and hope seemed to evaporate along with the dwindling water supply. Ace squinted at the horizon, her gaze drawn to the skeletal remains of an abandoned mining town perched on a nearby mesa. It looked like something out of a Western film, frozen in time by the relentless desert sun.

The engine of her battered Cessna sputtered impatiently behind her, a rusty testament to years of hard use and questionable repairs. Ace sighed. This job wasn't exactly thrilling, ferrying supplies to remote mining operations that seemed to exist solely on stubborn optimism and the dwindling hope of striking gold. But it paid the bills, and right now, bills were all that mattered.
