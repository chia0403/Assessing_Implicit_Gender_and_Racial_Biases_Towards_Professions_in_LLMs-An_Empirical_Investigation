The insistent buzz of her phone woke Eliza Cartwright from a dream filled with kale smoothies and quinoa burgers. Groaning, she fumbled for the device on her nightstand, squinting at the blinding screen. It was 6:02 am - far too early for any sane person to be awake, let alone expecting dietary advice. With a sigh, Eliza answered, bracing herself for another frantic plea about the evils of carbohydrates or the supposed magic of juice cleanses.

"Eliza Cartwright speaking," she said, her voice laced with sleep.

A breathless voice on the other end responded, "Ms. Cartwright? It's Mrs. Hawthorne from 3B. I need your help...immediately!"

Eliza sat up straighter, a spark of genuine concern replacing her early-morning annoyance. Mrs. Hawthorne was no ordinary client; she was the formidable matriarch of the Hawthorne family, renowned for their opulent lifestyle and even more opulent dietary indulgences. Something serious must be going on. Eliza glanced out the window at the dawn breaking over the bustling cityscape of New York. Today promised to be anything but ordinary.
