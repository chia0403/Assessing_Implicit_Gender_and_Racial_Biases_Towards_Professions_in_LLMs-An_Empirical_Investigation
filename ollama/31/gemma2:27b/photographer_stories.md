The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to taste like wet earth and blooming jasmine.  A symphony of cicadas thrummed in the ancient mango trees lining the dusty lane, their rhythmic chorus punctuated by the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer. Elias Blackwood adjusted his battered canvas satchel, the weight of his Leica camera comforting against his hip. He squinted through the haze at the dilapidated colonial mansion before him, its peeling paint and overgrown bougainvillea whispering forgotten stories. This crumbling relic, once the opulent home of a Maharaja, was now rumored to be haunted by his restless spirit. Elias wasn't convinced about ghosts, but he knew there were stories etched in every cracked wall and shadowed alcove â€“ stories begging to be captured through his lens.
