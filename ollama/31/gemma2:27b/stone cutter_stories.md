The midday sun beat down on the dusty square, turning the cobblestones into shimmering ovens. Sweat trickled down Elias Thorne's neck, stinging his eyes as he chipped away at a block of rough-hewn granite. The rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel echoed through the bustling marketplace, competing with the cries of hawkers and the clatter of mule hooves on stone.

Elias was a man shaped by his craft – broad shoulders and calloused hands testified to years spent wrestling with unforgiving stone. His face, weathered like an ancient statue, bore lines etched deep by sun and hardship. Today, he was carving a gargoyle for the new cathedral, its grotesque visage slowly emerging from the raw material.

But Elias wasn't thinking about angels or saints. He was lost in memories – of his wife, Elara, with her laughter as bright as sunlight on snow; of their son, Caleb, who dreamt of becoming a sailor and seeing the world beyond the mountains that cradled their village.
