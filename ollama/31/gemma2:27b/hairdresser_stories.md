The humid Savannah air clung to Beatrice Evangeline "Bea" Dubois like a second skin as she wrestled with Mrs. Henderson's impossibly thick hair. Bea sighed, her breath fogging the mirror momentarily. Outside, cicadas thrummed their incessant summer song, a constant backdrop to life in this charming but sweltering Southern city.

Her salon, "Bea's Brushes & Blooms," was tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street, its window boxes overflowing with vibrant bougainvillea and jasmine. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating the swirling dust motes and casting playful shadows on the worn wooden floorboards. Bea loved her little haven, its cozy atmosphere a balm against the heat and humidity outside. 

But today, Mrs. Henderson's stubborn curls were testing even Bea's patience. The woman was insistent on a "youthful pixie cut," which seemed impossible given the volume of hair she possessed.
