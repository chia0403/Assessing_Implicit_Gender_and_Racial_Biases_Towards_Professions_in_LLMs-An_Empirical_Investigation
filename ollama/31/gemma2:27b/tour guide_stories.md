The midday sun beat down on Elena Ramirez's already sweat-dampened shirt as she gestured towards the crumbling archway. "This," she announced to her group of wide-eyed tourists, "is believed to be one of the original entrances to the lost city of Xi’balba." A collective gasp went through the crowd. 

Elena smiled, relishing in their awe. She loved this part of the tour. The ancient Maya ruins of Tikal were breathtaking, shrouded in emerald green jungle and teeming with history.  But it was Elena's job to bring those stones and trees to life, weaving stories of kings and queens, gods and sacrifices, into a tapestry that captivated her audience. Today's group, however, felt different.

Their faces, though filled with wonder, held an underlying tension – a sense of urgency that she couldn't quite place. Elena chalked it up to the heat and humidity, but as she continued leading them deeper into the labyrinthine ruins, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss.
