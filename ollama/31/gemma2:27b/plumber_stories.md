Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Bernadette "Bernie" O'Malley's van, each drop exploding in a tiny geyser of rust-colored water. The air hung thick with the scent of wet asphalt and woodsmoke, a uniquely Dublin aroma that Bernie usually found comforting, but today it only amplified her growing frustration. She was already running late for Mrs. Doherty's leaky faucet - a disaster waiting to happen, according to the frantic voicemail left by the poor woman.

Bernie gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  The rain showed no signs of letting up, transforming the cobblestone streets of Temple Bar into miniature rivers. Her trusty toolkit lay dormant in the back, each wrench and pipe fitting promising a solution to the plumbing woes plaguing Dublin's inhabitants. But tonight, they felt more like mocking reminders of her predicament: she was stuck, wedged between a delivery truck and a overflowing dumpster in a narrow alleyway. 

The rhythmic clanging of trams echoed through the storm, reminding Bernie of the ticking clock. Mrs. Doherty, a frail widow known for her delicate china teacups and even more delicate temper, wouldn't be pleased with this delay.  Bernie sighed, resigned to the fact that tonight's plumbing adventure would be anything but straightforward.
