Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the hammering in Eloise Beaumont's chest. Her fingers hovered over the keys of her ancient typewriter, the worn ivory protesting with each tentative tap.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping through the gnarled branches of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel beside her ramshackle cottage. 

Eloise was trapped. Not by the storm raging outside, but by the blank page staring back at her.  Words, once her faithful companions, had deserted her. Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the fog-shrouded moors of Yorkshire, lay stalled, its narrative thread severed like a fraying rope. She'd envisioned a tale of hidden secrets and chilling encounters, but the muse had gone silent, leaving Eloise with only the hollow echo of her own doubt.
