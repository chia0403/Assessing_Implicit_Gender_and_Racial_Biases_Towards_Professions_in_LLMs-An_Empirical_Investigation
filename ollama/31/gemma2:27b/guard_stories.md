Rain lashed against the iron-wrought gates of Castle Dunhaven, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the cobblestones below. Thaddeus Blackwood, his cloak plastered to his broad shoulders, shivered despite the heavy wool. He tightened his grip on the spear he carried, its tip glinting ominously under the flickering gaslights that lined the castle wall.

Dunhaven, perched precariously on a craggy cliff overlooking the storm-tossed Grey Sea, had stood for centuries, a bulwark against barbarian raids and the capricious whims of fortune. But tonight, Thaddeus felt an unsettling unease crawl beneath his skin. The storm, while fierce, seemed unnatural, its howling winds carrying whispers of unseen dangers.

The drawbridge groaned as it lowered, admitting a lone rider into the courtyard. Thaddeus squinted through the driving rain, barely making out the figure silhouetted against the castle's dimly lit walls. 

Something about the rider – the slumped posture, the desperate urgency in the way they urged their horse forward – set Thaddeus' teeth on edge. He braced himself for whatever darkness this storm might bring.
