The Parisian twilight painted the sky in bruised hues of lavender and apricot as Elodie Beaumont adjusted the crimson velvet rope barring entry to the grand foyer of Hôtel de la Lune. A symphony of car horns and distant accordion music drifted through the open doors, a testament to the city's ceaseless heartbeat.

Elodie sighed, her perfectly manicured fingers tracing the intricate gold embroidery on her starched white uniform. The lobby, normally abuzz with the chatter of multilingual guests, was eerily quiet. It had been like this all week – an unsettling lull before what she knew would be a storm.

The annual Parisian Fashion Week was about to begin, and Hôtel de la Lune, with its history steeped in haute couture and scandalous affairs, was the preferred haven for designers, models, and the glitterati. Soon, the air would crackle with champagne bubbles, whispered secrets, and the intoxicating scent of expensive perfume. Elodie, despite her calm exterior, felt a flutter of excitement mixed with apprehension.

This year, she had a feeling something extraordinary – and perhaps dangerous – was about to unfold.
