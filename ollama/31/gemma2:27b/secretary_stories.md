The clacking rhythm of Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright's typewriter was the only sound in Mr. Thornton's cavernous office after five. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the cityscape below into an impressionistic smear of grey and gold. The scent of old paper and pipe tobacco hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Evelyn who had spent the last ten years tending to Mr. Thornton's every whim. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A peculiar tension crackled in the room, amplified by the rhythmic pulse of thunder outside. Mr. Thornton was late, uncharacteristically so. His usual booming voice hadn't echoed through the mahogany door since lunchtime, and a gnawing worry began to twist in Evelyn's gut.
