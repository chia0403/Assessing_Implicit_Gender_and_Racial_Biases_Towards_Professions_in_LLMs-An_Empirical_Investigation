The insistent chime of a notification pulled Eloise Beaumont from her daydream. A wave of lavender-scented air washed over her as she glanced at her phone, the picture on the lock screen a blurry snapshot of Santorini's whitewashed buildings against a sapphire sky. It was Mrs. Petrov, her most demanding client, requesting an update on the private jet arrangements for her upcoming trip to Marrakech. Eloise sighed. 

Her office, nestled in a quiet corner of Greenwich Village, was a world away from the sun-drenched markets and opulent riads Mrs. Petrov craved. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating shelves crammed with travel brochures and globes dusted with the patina of countless journeys. A vintage poster depicting the Eiffel Tower hung above her desk, its faded colours a testament to Eloise's own insatiable wanderlust. She yearned for adventure, but her life was tethered to this small space, weaving itineraries for others instead of crafting her own.
