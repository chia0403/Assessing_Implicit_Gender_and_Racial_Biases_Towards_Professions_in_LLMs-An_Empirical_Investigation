The chill of pre-dawn clung to Silas Thaddeus Grimshaw like a second skin. His breath puffed out in pale plumes as he unlocked the heavy oak door of Grimshawâ€™s Meats, the pungent aroma of salt and smoke wafting out to greet him.

Silas wasn't a man easily rattled. Years spent elbow-deep in carcasses had hardened him against most things, but the gnawing anxiety in his gut this morning was something new. It was market day, the busiest day of the week for his family's butcher shop, and rumour had it that Lord Blackwood himself would be paying a visit. 

The thought sent shivers down Silas's spine, far colder than the pre-dawn air. Lord Blackwood, with his cruel reputation and insatiable appetite for exotic delicacies, was known to demand the rarest cuts and most unusual preparations. Silas had heard whispers of him requesting roasted peacock hearts and jellied viper tongues. What could he possibly want from a humble butcher like Silas?

Grimshaw's Meats sat nestled amongst the cobblestone streets of Willow Creek, a quaint village where life moved at a slower pace. The scent of baking bread from Mrs. Higgins' bakery next door mingled with the earthy aroma of Silas' shop, creating a peculiar but comforting olfactory cocktail.  The rising sun cast long shadows across the market square, illuminating the stalls already bustling with activity - fishmongers hawking their silvery catch, bakers displaying loaves of crusty bread, and farmers unloading baskets brimming with plump fruit and vegetables.

Silas took a deep breath, steeling himself for the day ahead. He needed to focus on his craft, on providing the best quality meat for his customers, regardless of who they were. After all, he was Silas Thaddeus Grimshaw, butcher extraordinaire, and he wouldn't be intimidated by any lord or rumour.
