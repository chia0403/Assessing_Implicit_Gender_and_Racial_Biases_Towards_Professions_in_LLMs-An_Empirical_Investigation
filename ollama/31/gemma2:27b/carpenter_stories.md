The humid air clung to Elias Thorne like a wet blanket as he surveyed the skeletal frame of the Victorian mansion rising from the overgrown lot. The afternoon sun beat down on the patchwork roof, casting long shadows that danced with the swaying branches of ancient oaks lining the property line.  Dust motes swirled in the shafts of sunlight filtering through the gaps in the unfinished walls, revealing the intricate network of beams Elias had painstakingly crafted over the past few weeks.

Elias, a man weathered by years spent wrestling wood and battling deadlines, ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of a newly installed joist. The scent of sawdust and cedar filled his nostrils, a familiar and comforting aroma that spoke of creation and resilience. He inhaled deeply, letting the scent ground him. This house, with its gingerbread trim and soaring gables, was more than just a job; it was a testament to his skill, a symphony of wood and nails he hoped would stand for generations to come.


But today, a knot of unease tightened in Elias's stomach. He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. Perhaps it was the unsettling silence that blanketed the site, broken only by the chirping of cicadas and the distant rumble of traffic. Or maybe it was the whispers he'd overheard from the other workers, tales of strange occurrences and eerie sightings on the property after dark.

Whatever the reason, Elias couldn't help but feel a shiver crawl up his spine as he turned his back to the mansion and headed towards his toolbox. The shadows were lengthening, and dusk was approaching. He needed to finish securing the remaining beams before nightfall, but something told him he wouldn't be alone after dark.
