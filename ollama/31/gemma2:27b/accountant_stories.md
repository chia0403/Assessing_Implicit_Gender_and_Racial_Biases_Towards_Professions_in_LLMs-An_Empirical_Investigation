Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Alistair Finch's office, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of grime. The streetlights outside blurred into streaks of yellow through the incessant downpour. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.

Alistair, his brow furrowed beneath a mop of unruly brown hair, hunched over a spreadsheet on his ancient computer screen. Numbers swam before his eyes, a chaotic symphony of debits and credits that refused to reconcile. He ran a hand through his already disheveled hair, the sound of keys clicking echoing in the silence of his cramped office above Mrs. Higgins' bakery.

Alistair Finch was an accountant, though "bean counter" was perhaps a more accurate description. He wasn't one for flashy suits or fancy offices; he preferred the comfort of faded cardigans and the company of ledgers filled with neat rows and columns. But tonight, even his usual solace in numbers offered no escape. The client files piled precariously on his desk seemed to mock him with their unanswered questions, the weight of impending deadlines pressing down on him like a physical burden.
