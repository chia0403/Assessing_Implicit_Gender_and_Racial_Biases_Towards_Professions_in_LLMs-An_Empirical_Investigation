The humid Georgia air clung to Elias Finch like a damp wool blanket as he wrestled with a recalcitrant azalea bush. Its roots, gnarled and stubborn, refused to budge from their long-established home beneath the Spanish moss-draped oak tree. Sweat stung Elias' eyes, blurring the vibrant reds and yellows of the late summer blooms around him. He wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of dirt across his already sun-weathered skin.

He wasn't supposed to be working on this particular Saturday morning. It was supposed to be a day for fishing with his grandfather down by the Okefenokee Swamp, a tradition they'd shared since Elias was a boy. But Mrs. Hawthorne, a notoriously demanding client with a penchant for hydrangeas and an even stronger penchant for getting what she wanted, had called at dawn with a "dire situation" â€“ her prize-winning rose bush had inexplicably wilted.

Elias sighed, the scent of jasmine and honeysuckle thick in the air. He loved his work, he truly did. Shaping sprawling landscapes into vibrant canvases, coaxing life from thirsty earth, it filled him with a sense of quiet satisfaction. But sometimes, he wished for a day free from the demands of Mrs. Hawthorne and her ever-changing floral whims.

He tugged at the azalea bush once more, feeling its roots finally give way with a satisfying crack. He straightened up, surveying the scene. The rose bush, a magnificent crimson bloom barely clinging to life, awaited his attention. And somewhere in the distance, he imagined his grandfather casting a line into the murky waters of the swamp, his weathered face etched with disappointment.
