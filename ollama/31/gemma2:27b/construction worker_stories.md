The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Petrovich's neck, turning the sweat gathering there into a shimmering stream. Dust motes danced in the air above the half-built skyscraper, reflecting the sunlight and making Eli squint as he wrestled with a stubborn rebar rod. The cacophony of the construction site was deafening: the clang of metal on metal, the hiss of pneumatics, the shouts of foremen barking orders.

Eli's muscles strained with each push and pull. He wasn't built like some of the other guys on the crew – broad-shouldered brutes who could bend steel bars with their bare hands. Eli was wiry, all sinew and grit, his strength coming from years of tireless work and a stubborn refusal to give up. This project, though, was testing him.

The skyscraper they were building stretched towards the sky like a skeletal giant, its steel bones reaching for something beyond the haze of city smog. From this height, Eli could see everything: the gridlock of traffic crawling below, the tiny figures milling about in parks and plazas, the distant shimmer of the Hudson River.  It was a humbling view, one that reminded him how small he was in the grand scheme of things.


Eli paused for a moment, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. He glanced up at the incomplete structure above him, its unfinished floors and exposed beams a testament to the ongoing struggle against gravity. A feeling of unease crept over him, a prickling sensation he couldn't quite place. It wasn't fear exactly, more like a growing sense of foreboding. Something felt wrong, out of sync with the usual rhythm of construction.

And then he heard it – a faint, almost imperceptible tremor running through the steel beneath his feet.
