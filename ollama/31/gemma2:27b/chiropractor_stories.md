Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Thorne's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously in the window. The relentless drumming echoed Evelyn's own hammering pulse as she stared at the skeletal x-ray laid out on her lightbox. A shiver ran down her spine, unrelated to the chill creeping through the drafty Victorian building. This wasn't a typical misalignment. The vertebrae were twisted at an unnatural angle, almost contorted, like something had forcefully snapped them into place. Evelyn frowned, tracing the jagged lines with a calloused fingertip.

Who could have done this? And why?

The patient, a young man named Liam, was due back in ten minutes for his follow-up appointment. He'd arrived yesterday, barely able to stand, his face etched with pain and a strange, almost manic fear. Evelyn had seen her share of injuries over her years practicing in the rough-and-tumble neighborhood of Bellhaven, but Liamâ€™s case was different. It smelled of something darker, something that lurked beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary chiropractic appointment.
