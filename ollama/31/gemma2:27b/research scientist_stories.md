Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Dr. Evelyn Albright's lab, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic wash of grey and gold. The storm mirrored the turmoil within her. Stacks of research papers threatened to topple from her desk, each page filled with intricate diagrams and cryptic notes on the elusive protein she was chasing: Neurogen-7. For years, Evelyn had poured her heart and soul into unlocking its secrets, believing it held the key to regenerating damaged nerve tissue, a potential revolution in treating spinal cord injuries and neurodegenerative diseases.

But today, doubt gnawed at her. Her latest experiment had yielded inconclusive results, throwing a wrench into months of painstaking progress. The vial containing the synthesized Neurogen-7 sat on the lab bench, mocking her with its milky, viscous contents. 

Evelyn sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her braid. The sterile white walls of the lab seemed to close in around her, amplifying the sense of isolation. She needed fresh air, a break from the relentless scrutiny of her microscope and the pressure of her own expectations.
