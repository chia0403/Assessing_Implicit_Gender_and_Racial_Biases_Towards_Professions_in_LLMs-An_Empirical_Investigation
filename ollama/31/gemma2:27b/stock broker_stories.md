Rain hammered against the frosted glass windows of Alistair Finchley's corner office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The ticker tape scrolled across his monitor, spitting out numbers that were more red than green these days. It had been a brutal month for the market, and Alistair, once known as "The Midas Touch," was feeling more like King Midas in reverse â€“ everything he touched turned to lead. 

His sleek office, perched high above Wall Street, felt suffocating. The mahogany desk, usually gleaming under the soft glow of designer lamps, seemed dull and lifeless. Even the panoramic view of the city below, normally a source of inspiration, couldn't penetrate the gloom that had settled over him. Alistair rubbed his temples, trying to ward off the headache building behind his eyes. He needed a win, something, anything to turn the tide.  

A sharp ping from his phone broke through his thoughts. It was an email from a client, demanding an explanation for their recent losses. Alistair sighed. This wasn't going to be easy.
