The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the brightly coloured alphabet rug. Emilia Rose Hathaway sighed, smoothing down a stray curl that had escaped her bun. Crayons littered the floor like fallen autumn leaves, and the faint scent of glue hung in the air, mingling with the sweet smell of apple juice boxes. Outside, the playground buzzed with the joyful shrieks of children on recess, but inside Emilia's classroom at Sunnybrook Kindergarten, a different kind of energy thrummed. 

Five-year-old Leo was on the verge of tears, his chubby fists clenched around a crumpled piece of construction paper. A smear of purple paint adorned his cheek, looking suspiciously like the colour he'd used for Barney the dinosaur in his failed masterpiece.  Emilia knelt beside him, her heart aching at his distress. Today, everything seemed to be going wrong. From the missing glue stick to the spilled milk carton, the universe seemed determined to test Emilia's patience.
