The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  Sunbeams, fractured by a canopy of Douglas fir giants, dappled the forest floor where Elias Blackwood crouched, examining a fallen behemoth. Its once-proud crown now lay shattered, its reddish bark scarred by the bite of his saw. Elias ran a calloused hand over the rough wood, feeling the lifeblood that still thrummed faintly beneath the surface.  He'd been logging these woods since he was a boy, learning the rhythms of the forest alongside his father before him. It was honest work, backbreaking and unforgiving, but it fed his soul as surely as it filled his belly.

Today, however, a disquiet settled upon Elias like morning mist. Something felt off - a subtle shift in the wind, an unnatural stillness amongst the birds. He straightened, wiping sweat from his brow with a sleeve stained black with sawdust. As he scanned the towering trees, their shadows stretching long and menacing in the fading afternoon light, Elias swore he saw movement out of the corner of his eye. A flicker of something dark disappearing behind a tangle of ferns.  His gut clenched. This wasn't the first time he'd seen it â€“ a fleeting glimpse, always gone before he could focus.
