The flickering fluorescent lights cast an unsettling hum over Dr. Eleanor Vance's cluttered office. Dusty textbooks teetered precariously on overflowing shelves, competing for space with colorful construction paper owls and macaroni-studded rainbows crafted by her younger clients. Outside the window, the late October sun painted the maple trees in fiery hues of crimson and gold, a stark contrast to the grey clouds gathering on the horizon. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. A storm was brewing, both literally and figuratively. 

She glanced at the clock, its hands ticking relentlessly towards three o'clock â€“ the time when twelve-year-old Liam Davies was scheduled for his weekly session. Liam was a complex case; bright, introspective, yet plagued by anxieties that manifested in crippling panic attacks and an inability to connect with his peers. Eleanor had been working with him for months, trying to unravel the knot of emotions that seemed to bind him. Today felt different, though. A sense of foreboding hung heavy in the air, like the scent of ozone before a thunderstorm.
