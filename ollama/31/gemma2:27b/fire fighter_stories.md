The acrid sting of smoke filled Amelia "Amy" Reyes's nostrils as she hauled herself up the rickety fire escape, her boots finding precarious purchase on rusted metal grating. The flames roared from the third-floor window above, painting the night sky an angry orange. Sirens wailed in the distance, a symphony of approaching help that felt agonizingly slow.  

The building, a dilapidated tenement on the edge of Brooklyn's industrial district, shuddered under the inferno's onslaught. Brick crumbled, sending showers of sparks into the darkness. Amy gripped her axe tighter, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. This wasn't just another call; something felt wrong, unsettlingly quiet beneath the raging fire. There was no panicked screaming, no desperate cries for help.

Just the insatiable roar of flames.
