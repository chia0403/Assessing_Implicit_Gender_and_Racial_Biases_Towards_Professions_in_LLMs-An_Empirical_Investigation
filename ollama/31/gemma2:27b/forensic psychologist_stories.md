Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's heart. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the man slouched across from her. His name was Simon Hayes, and his eyes, red-rimmed and haunted, were fixed on some distant point beyond the mirrored wall. 

Evelyn, with her sharp cheekbones and tightly wound auburn braid, leaned forward, her expression carefully neutral. The scent of stale coffee and fear hung heavy in the air. This wasn't Evelyn's typical case - a straightforward evaluation for competency to stand trial. This was something different. Something darker. Simon Hayes was suspected of murdering his entire family, and Evelyn had been brought in not just to assess his mental state, but to delve into the abyss of his mind and try to understand what could drive a man to such unspeakable acts.
