The neon glow of the "Last Chance Diner" flickered across Silas Montgomery's face as he pulled his eighteen-wheeler into the dusty lot. It was 3:00 am, the hour when the world seemed to hold its breath before the sun rose and breathed life back into it.  Silas, a man built like a redwood tree with hands calloused from years of gripping the steering wheel, sighed as he climbed out of his cab. He cracked his neck, the sound echoing in the silent night, and stretched his legs, feeling the familiar ache in his lower back. 

He had been hauling lumber from Oregon to Texas for weeks, a monotonous journey across the endless plains punctuated only by the occasional greasy spoon diner and the constant hum of the engine. Tonight, Silas was craving more than just coffee and a slice of pie. He craved human connection, a conversation that wasn't filled with CB chatter about road closures and bad weather. 

As he walked towards the diner, its windows glowing like beacons in the darkness, Silas hoped for a friendly face, someone to share a story with.  He knew the odds were slim, but even a fleeting moment of connection could make this lonely life a little less desolate.
