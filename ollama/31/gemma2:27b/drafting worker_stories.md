The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Cartwright's head, casting a sterile glow over the blueprints spread across her drafting table. Rain lashed against the windows of the cavernous office, blurring the cityscape outside into an impressionistic watercolour.  Eleanor tapped her pencil against the ruler, the sound echoing in the near-empty space. The rhythmic click was a counterpoint to the steady drumming of the rain and the distant rumble of thunder that shook the old building.

It was past eight, long after everyone else had left for the day. Eleanor preferred it this way - the quiet hum of machinery and the solitude allowed her to focus.  Tonight, she was working on revisions for a new skyscraper, its sleek lines promising to pierce the very clouds Eleanor watched from her window. But tonight, inspiration felt elusive, replaced by a gnawing unease that settled in her stomach like a stone.
