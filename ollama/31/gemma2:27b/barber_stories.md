The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a familiar comfort to Theodore "Teddy" Beaumont. Outside his shop window, rain lashed against the cobblestone street, blurring the gaslights into halos of shimmering gold. Inside, Teddy's Barber Shop was a haven from the storm, a sanctuary of wood-paneled walls, worn leather chairs, and the rhythmic snip-snip of Teddy's shears.  

Teddy himself was a man carved from oak and seasoned by years – his hands calloused but gentle, his eyes crinkled with good humour behind thick spectacles. He hummed a tuneless melody as he expertly navigated around Mr. Higgins’ earlobe, meticulously trimming away stray hairs. The shop bell jingled, announcing the arrival of another customer, and Teddy turned, a welcoming smile already blossoming on his face.
