The insistent trill of the vintage rotary phone jolted Amelia Beatrice Cartwright back to reality.  She'd been daydreaming again, her fingers idly tracing patterns on the worn mahogany surface of her reception desk. Outside, the Parisian drizzle had intensified, turning the cobblestone street into a shimmering ribbon reflecting the muted glow of the gaslights. The scent of freshly baked croissants wafted in from the boulangerie across the street, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender and old books that permeated the Hôtel de la Lune. 

Amelia sighed, picking up the receiver. "Hôtel de la Lune, Amelia speaking," she said, her voice carrying a practiced cheerfulness despite the dreary weather.  But even as she answered, a prickle of unease ran down her spine. The caller's voice was low and gravelly, barely audible over the crackle of the line. It spoke in clipped phrases, asking for someone named "Le Chat Noir," a name Amelia had never encountered before.
