The pre-dawn air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and brewing coffee as Elara Bellweather adjusted the oven door, its heat radiating against her face. Her bakery, "The Flour Moon," nestled on a cobbled side street in the quaint seaside town of Oakhaven, was already beginning to hum with activity.

Sunlight, filtered through the shop's dusty windowpanes, illuminated rows of sourdough loaves, glistening croissants, and jewel-toned fruit tarts arranged meticulously on wooden shelves. Elara, her flour-dusted apron tied tight around her waist, surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye. Today was the annual Oakhaven Harvest Festival, and the pressure was on to create pastries that would rival the town's legendary cider donuts.

A familiar clink announced Mr. Henderson, the portly milkman, arriving with his delivery. Elara smiled warmly at him as he stacked crates of fresh cream beside her worktable. "Morning, Mr. Henderson," she chirped. "Anything exciting happen in Oakhaven this week?"

Mr. Henderson chuckled, his round belly jiggling merrily. "Just the usual gossip, Miss Bellweather. Old Mrs. Hawthorne claims she saw a mermaid by the docks again, and young Timmy Johnson swore he heard a talking raven." He winked. "You know how it is, small towns and their tales."


Elara laughed softly, her mind already racing with ideas for a new pastry inspired by Oakhaven's mythical creatures - perhaps a seashell-shaped Ã©clair filled with lavender cream, or a raven-feather croissant dusted with charcoal sugar. But as she reached for the flour canister, a sudden gust of wind slammed against the shop door, sending shivers down her spine and extinguishing the single flickering lantern illuminating the counter.

Something wasn't right.
