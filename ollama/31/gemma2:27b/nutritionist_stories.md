Rain lashed against the windows of The Daily Grind, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an Impressionistic smear of red and green. Inside, Eleanor Rosalind Finch, renowned nutritionist and owner of the cozy cafe, sighed as she watched the storm rage outside. Usually, this hour was her busiest, filled with the clatter of plates and animated conversations over her signature kale smoothies and quinoa wraps. Today, however, only two lone figures occupied tables – a student hunched over his laptop in the corner, and an elderly woman sipping chamomile tea, lost in a well-worn paperback.

Eleanor, usually brimming with cheerful energy, felt a familiar ache settle in her chest. The past few weeks had been rough. Business was slower than usual, and whispers of a new "miracle diet" craze sweeping through social media were starting to make their way into her cafe. This "Keto Blitz," promising rapid weight loss with near-zero carbohydrates, threatened everything Eleanor believed in – the joy of balanced meals, mindful eating, and nourishing your body with wholesome ingredients.
