Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her own chest. The worn leather chair across from her remained empty, mockingly echoing the silence that had become all too familiar in recent weeks. Outside, the city of Edinburgh hummed with life, its cobblestone streets slick with rain and the air thick with the scent of wood smoke and brine. But within these four walls, a suffocating stillness reigned. 

Eleanor's fingers drummed against her mahogany desk, polished smooth by years of anxious tapping. The weight of her latest case pressed heavily on her mind: Fiona MacLeod, a young woman plagued by nightmares so vivid they bled into her waking hours, leaving her paralyzed with fear and teetering on the brink of a complete psychological breakdown.

Eleanor had always prided herself on her ability to decipher the tangled threads of the human psyche, but Fiona's case was proving to be a Gordian knot she couldn't unravel. The nightmares were unlike anything Eleanor had encountered before – steeped in ancient lore and whispered secrets, filled with shadowy figures and landscapes that seemed to belong to another time altogether.
