The air hung thick with the scent of lilies and lavender, a heady perfume that Eliza Bellweather usually found comforting. Today, however, it felt suffocating, mirroring the knot in her stomach. Her flower shop, "Bloom & Branch," nestled on the cobblestone corner of Mulberry Street and Oak Avenue, was normally abuzz with activity - chattering customers, tinkling wind chimes, the gentle rustle of leaves from the weeping willow outside. But today, the silence was as heavy as the humid summer air. Eliza stared at the wilting sunflowers in the window display, their cheerful faces drooping like mourners.

It wasn't the heatwave that bothered her, nor the unexpected dip in business. It was the letter lying unopened on her workbench, its crisp white envelope bearing the unfamiliar, spidery handwriting of a solicitor sheâ€™d never met. The words "Estate of Eleanor Bellweather" were scrawled across the front, and Eliza knew, with a sinking heart, that this letter would change everything.
