The smell of burnt oil and gasoline hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of ozone from the arc welder crackling in the corner.  Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the ramshackle garage, turning the corrugated iron roof into a sizzling skillet. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Reyes wiped her greasy hands on a rag, squinting at the engine block spread out on her workbench like a disassembled puzzle. 

She was deep in the heart of Mesa, miles from the glitz and glamour of Scottsdale. Her shop, "Reyes Repair," wasn't much to look at â€“ faded paint, rusty tools scattered around, and more dents than a demolition derby car. But Amy knew every inch of it like the back of her hand, and she could coax life out of any engine that rolled through her doors. Today, however, the engine in front of her was proving particularly stubborn.
