The July sun beat down on ElizaBeth Anne Cartwright's perfectly coiffed blonde hair as she navigated the overgrown path leading to the Victorian mansion. It was a fixer-upper, for sure, its once vibrant paint peeling like sunburnt skin and its gingerbread trim crumbling with age. But ElizaBeth Anne saw past the decay. She envisioned restored grandeur: gleaming hardwood floors, stained glass windows catching the sunlight, and laughter echoing through the halls. This house, despite its current state of disrepair, had potential – a quality she prided herself on spotting in both properties and people. 

Nestled deep within the wooded hills of Vermont, the mansion was a secluded relic of a bygone era.  A heavy silence hung in the air, broken only by the chirping of crickets and the rustle of leaves in the gentle breeze. ElizaBeth Anne inhaled deeply, smelling damp earth and decaying wood – a scent strangely comforting in its familiarity. This wasn't her usual clientele – young couples seeking starter homes or families looking for more space. This property, with its haunting beauty and air of forgotten secrets, was begging for a different kind of buyer: someone who craved solitude, history, and perhaps a touch of magic.  

As she approached the heavy oak door, its brass knocker tarnished green with age, ElizaBeth Anne couldn't shake the feeling that this house held stories waiting to be unearthed. Stories that might just change her life forever.
