Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thorne's office, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of urban misery playing outside. The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke, cheap whiskey, and the lingering scent of despair – a potent cocktail that clung to everything in the cramped space like a second skin.

Elias, his greying hair slicked back with something resembling motor oil, stared out at the grimy alley below through a haze of smoke. His face, a roadmap of hard living etched with wrinkles and scars, was set in a grim mask.  He took a long drag from his cigarette, the ember glowing fiercely like a dying star against the backdrop of the city's perpetual dusk.

A knock echoed through the room, sharp and insistent. Elias stubbed out his cigarette, the acrid smell momentarily stinging his nostrils. He knew what this meant – another lost soul seeking answers in the labyrinthine streets of New Arcadia, a city that devoured dreams as readily as it did lives.  He straightened his threadbare suit jacket, grabbed the dusty bottle of whiskey from his desk, and muttered, "Let's see what kind of misery walks through my door tonight."
