The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and woodsmoke, a symphony for Elodie Antoinette Dubois's senses. It was her favorite time of day – just before the dinner rush at "Chez Antoinette," her tiny, jewel-box restaurant tucked away on a cobblestone street in Montmartre. Outside, the Eiffel Tower glittered like a celestial beacon against the dusky Parisian sky. Inside, Elodie, with flour dusted across her apron and a determined glint in her sapphire eyes, orchestrated the controlled chaos of her kitchen. 


Tonight's special: pan-seared duck breast with fig reduction and lavender-infused mashed potatoes – a dish as delicate and complex as Elodie herself.
