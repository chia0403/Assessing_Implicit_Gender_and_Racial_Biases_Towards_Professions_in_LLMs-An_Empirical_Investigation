The musty scent of old velvet seats and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air. Rosalind "Rosie" Beaumont adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up her nose as she surveyed the dilapidated Grand Majestic Theatre. Dust motes danced in the sliver of afternoon sun piercing through a crack in the boarded-up window.

Rosie had a vision for it though - a phoenix rising from the ashes, a haven for experimental theatre, a space where stories could be told anew. 

But first, she needed to convince the skeptical owner, a man rumored to have a heart colder than the theater's drafty corridors. Today was the day.  Rosie straightened her scarf, took a deep breath, and marched towards the stage door, her boots echoing through the cavernous silence. The show, as they say, was about to begin.
