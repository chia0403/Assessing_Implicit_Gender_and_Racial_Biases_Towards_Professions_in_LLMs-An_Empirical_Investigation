The rain hammered against the attic window, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in Elara Blackwood's chest. Outside, the gnarled branches of the ancient oak tree scraped against the glass, like skeletal fingers yearning for entry. Elara hunched over her battered laptop, the dim glow reflecting in her wide, emerald eyes. Her fingers hovered above the keyboard, paralyzed by a sudden wave of doubt.

She was on the cusp of finishing "Whispers from the Barrow," a gothic horror novel inspired by local legends and the eerie history of Blackwood Manor, the crumbling Victorian house she'd inherited from her eccentric great-aunt. The story, steeped in whispers of ghostly apparitions and ancient curses, had poured out of her for months. But now, with the climax just within reach, Elara felt a creeping sense of unease.

Was it just writer's block, or was something else at play? The manor itself seemed to be whispering warnings, its creaking floorboards and flickering lights echoing the unsettling events unfolding in her novel.
