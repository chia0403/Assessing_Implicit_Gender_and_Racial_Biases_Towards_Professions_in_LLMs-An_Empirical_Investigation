The rain hammered against the skylight above Amelia Cartwright's drafting table, each drop an insistent drumbeat drowning out the city's usual symphony of sirens and car horns. A chill snaked through the loft space despite the roaring heater tucked beneath her vintage drafting table. Amelia shivered, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself. She squinted at the blueprints spread before her, the lines blurring in the dimly lit room.

The building she was designing – a community center for a struggling neighborhood – was more than just bricks and mortar to Amelia. It was a lifeline, a chance to breathe life back into a forgotten corner of the city. But the developer was breathing down her neck, demanding revisions, cutting corners on materials, threatening to pull the plug entirely.

Amelia sighed, running a hand through her tangled auburn curls. The weight of responsibility pressed down on her like the rain-soaked clouds outside. She needed inspiration, a spark to ignite her stalled creativity. Glancing out the window at the shimmering cityscape, she saw a flicker of movement in the alleyway opposite her building. A figure, cloaked in shadows, was rummaging through a dumpster.
