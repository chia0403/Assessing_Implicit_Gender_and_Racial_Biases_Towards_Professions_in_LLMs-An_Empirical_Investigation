Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the turbulence brewing inside her.  The scent of old books and lavender hand cream usually calmed Eleanor, but today it felt suffocating. She stared at the framed diploma on the wall â€“ "Doctor of Philosophy in Counseling Psychology" - a testament to years of relentless study and an unwavering desire to help others navigate life's complexities. Yet, here she was, grappling with her own demons.

The late afternoon sunlight, struggling to penetrate the gray sky, painted long shadows across the plush rug in her office. Eleanor sank deeper into the worn leather armchair, its familiar creak a comforting counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Her phone lay silent on her desk, an unwelcome reminder of the unanswered calls from her own therapist. 

"Eleanor," a soft voice interrupted her thoughts. "Are you ready for Amelia?"

It was Clara, Eleanor's perpetually cheerful receptionist, peering in through the half-open door.  Clara's smile, though genuine, seemed to highlight the hollowness Eleanor felt within. She forced herself to return the gesture, taking a deep breath to steady her nerves. Today, she wouldn't let her own struggles interfere with helping Amelia, a young woman struggling with anxiety and the loss of her grandmother. Today, she would be the anchor, the calm in Amelia's storm.
