The air in the cramped workshop crackled with static, mirroring the storm raging outside. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elijah "Eli" Finch's garage-turned-workshop, each drop a percussive beat against the symphony of crackling transistors and humming vacuum tubes. Eli himself, grease smudged on his cheek and hair escaping its perpetually messy bun, hunched over a vintage Philco radio, its wooden casing scarred with time and faded paint. He held a soldering iron in one hand, deftly weaving a thin line of molten metal between two delicate wires. His brow furrowed in concentration as he listened intently through the earpiece, searching for the sweet spot â€“ that perfect balance of resistance and amplification where the faintest whisper could bloom into clear sound.

The radio, a relic from a bygone era, was Eli's latest obsession. He dreamed of restoring it to its former glory, imagining the crackle of static replaced with the warm voices of old-time radio announcers and the sweet melodies of jazz bands long gone silent. Tonight, however, his focus was interrupted by a jarring thump on the garage door. The rhythmic drumming of rain gave way to a persistent rapping, insistent and urgent. Eli sighed, wiping his hands on a greasy rag. Whatever it was, it wouldn't wait for the storm to pass. He carefully set down his soldering iron, grabbed a flashlight from its hook by the door, and braced himself for whatever awaited him in the tempestuous night.
