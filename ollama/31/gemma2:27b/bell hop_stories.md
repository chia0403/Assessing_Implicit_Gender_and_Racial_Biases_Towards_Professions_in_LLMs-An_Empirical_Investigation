The Grand Blackwood Hotel shimmered like a gilded cage against the bruised twilight sky. Its ornate facade, etched with gargoyles and griffins, loomed over Cecil Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, making him feel impossibly small. Bart tugged at his stiff, starched uniform, the bellhop badge glinting on his chest like an unwelcome eye.  

The lobby buzzed with a chaotic symphony of rolling luggage, clipped greetings, and tinkling piano music from the dimly lit lounge. The scent of lilies and expensive perfume hung heavy in the air, a sickly sweet reminder of the opulence that surrounded him. Bart sighed inwardly. He'd been dreaming of escaping this gilded prison since he started working here three years ago.

Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension crackled through the room, fueled by the arrival of a peculiar guest:  Lord Alistair Cavendish, a reclusive millionaire with a reputation for eccentricity and shrouded in mystery. Bart had heard whispers among the staff - rumors of lost treasures, ancient curses, and a dark secret hidden deep within the Lord's past. As Bart wheeled a mountain of luggage towards the elevator, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was about to be swept up in something far bigger than himself.
