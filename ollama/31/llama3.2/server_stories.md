Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit diner, "Mae's Eats," was a staple in the small town of Willow Creek, nestled in the heart of rural Ohio. The year was 1985, and the neon sign that creaked in the gentle breeze outside seemed to be the only thing holding on to the passing of time.

Inside, Mae herself, Mae Elizabeth Thompson, polished a mug with a white apron wrapped around her waist, her curly brown hair tied back in a tight ponytail. She had worked at Mae's Eats since she was 16 years old, and it showed - every surface of the diner seemed to be covered in the grease stains and scuff marks of years of loyal customers.

As the lunch rush subsided and the sun began to set over the cornfields outside, Mae took a moment to wipe her sweaty palms on her apron before sliding into the booth reserved for the regulars. The waitress who worked the late shift, Linda, slid a cup of steaming coffee in front of Mae, along with a small notebook full of scribbled notes and reminders.

"Hey, Mae," Linda said with a smile, "tonight's special is a new batch of chili - fresh ground beef and spices. And don't even get me started on the state of the kitchen - it's a miracle we haven't had a fire yet."
