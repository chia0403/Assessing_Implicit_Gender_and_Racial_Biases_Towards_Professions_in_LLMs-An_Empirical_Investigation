Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emmeline Alexandra "Emmie" Thompson stood at the edge of the small hospital room, her eyes fixed on the figure lying in the bed. The soft beeping of the machines surrounding the patient was the only sound in the otherwise silent space. The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the scene, making the sterile white walls seem to close in around Emmie like a vice.

It was a typical Wednesday evening at Mercy Hospital, with the evening shift crew rushing to finish their rounds before the night shift began. The hospital's aging building creaked and groaned beneath the weight of its patients, each one a unique puzzle waiting to be solved by the dedicated staff.

Emmie, a soft-spoken ER doctor with a kind heart and a sharp mind, had seen her fair share of late-night emergencies. But there was something about this patient that caught her attention - a young woman with an uncertain past, shrouded in mystery, and a single word scribbled on the chart: "Panic".

As Emmie began to survey the scene, she couldn't shake the feeling that this case would be anything but routine. Little did she know, the night was only just beginning, and the secrets hidden within these hospital walls were about to spill out in ways she never could have imagined.
