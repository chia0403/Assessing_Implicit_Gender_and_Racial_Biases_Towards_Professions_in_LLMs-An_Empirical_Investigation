Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the small town of Oakdale, Illinois, Evelyn Jean Thompson sat at her desk in the cramped office above the antique shop on Main Street. The scent of old books and dusty trinkets wafted down from below, mingling with the familiar smell of fresh paper and ink that filled the air. Outside, the streets were quiet, save for the occasional chirp of a cricket or the rumble of the evening commute.

Evelyn, a self-proclaimed "tax ninja," had spent the last decade honing her skills in the world of income tax preparation. She took pride in being the go-to expert for complex returns and tricky deductions, earning the nickname "The Tax Whisperer" among her clients. With her trademark curly brown hair tied back in a ponytail and a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose, Evelyn was a force to be reckoned with in the world of tax season.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee and sorted through the evening's batch of paperwork, Evelyn's mind began to wander. It had been a slow season so far, with only a handful of clients needing assistance. But as tax day approached, she knew that would soon change. The phone lines would be flooded with anxious taxpayers seeking guidance on everything from charitable donations to mortgage interest deductions. And Evelyn was ready.
