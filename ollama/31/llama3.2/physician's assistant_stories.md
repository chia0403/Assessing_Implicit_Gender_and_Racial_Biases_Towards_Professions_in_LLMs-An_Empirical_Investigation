As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets, Emilia Mae Thompson walked into the crisp autumn evening with a sense of unease. A twenty-five-year-old Physician's Assistant, Emilia had been working at the local hospital for three years, but tonight felt different.

She changed out of her scrub-clad uniform and swapped it for a worn denim jacket and faded jeans, readying herself to face the chill of the evening air. As she stepped outside into the crisp breeze, the streets were eerily quiet, save for the soft hum of crickets serenading the night sky.

The small hospital where Emilia worked was just a block away from her cozy apartment, nestled on Elm Street in the heart of Willow Creek. It was a place Emilia had grown to love over the years, but tonight it seemed ominous. She couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off.

As she walked down the sidewalk, Emilia's gaze drifted toward the old oak tree standing sentinel at the edge of town square. Its gnarled branches seemed to stretch out like skeletal fingers, beckoning her toward a sense of foreboding.

Emilia quickened her pace, her heart beating just a little faster as she approached the hospital doors. Tonight was supposed to be routine - a night shift at the emergency room with nothing more than minor injuries and routine surgeries to attend to. But Emilia's instincts told her otherwise.

And then, just as she pushed open the door to the hospital, a soft voice whispered in her ear: "Tonight is going to change everything."
