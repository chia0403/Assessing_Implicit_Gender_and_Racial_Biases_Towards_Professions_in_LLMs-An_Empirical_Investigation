Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of Route 66, casting a golden glow over the worn asphalt as Jack Harris cruised down the highway in his trusty Peterbilt 359. The engine hummed smoothly beneath him, a familiar rumble that had been Jack's constant companion for years. He'd driven this route countless times before, but tonight felt different - maybe it was the full moon hanging low in the sky, or the faint scent of rain on the breeze. Whatever it was, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

As a trucker, Jack had grown accustomed to the solitude of the open road. He'd spent years driving for various companies, ferrying goods across the country from one end of America to the other. But lately, he'd started to feel like he was losing touch with the world beyond his cab. The miles seemed longer, the traffic more congested, and the passengers more... unpredictable.

Jack's eyes scanned the rearview mirror as he approached a small town on the Arizona horizon. He needed to stop for fuel and grab some dinner before continuing on his journey to Los Angeles. As he pulled into the truck stop, Jack noticed something strange - a faded sign reading "Eddie's Truck Stop" hung crookedly above the entrance, and the office door was slightly ajar.

Jack's instincts prickled. Something about this place didn't feel right.
