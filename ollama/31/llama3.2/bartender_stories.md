Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the sign outside cast a gaudy glow over the rain-soaked streets of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Inside the dimly lit bars that lined the sidewalk, the sounds of laughter and clinking glasses filled the air, but in the cramped, smoke-filled space of McGillicuddy's Pub, a different kind of revelry was unfolding.

Behind the bar, bartender Kaitlyn "Kae" McGuire wiped down the worn wood with a dirty rag, her bright blue eyes scanning the small crowd of regulars who had gathered for their usual happy hour ritual. It was a routine she'd performed countless times before, but one that still brought a sense of comfort to her - a place where people came not just to drown their sorrows, but to find fleeting connections and temporary escapes from the world outside.

As Kae expertly mixed a round of whiskeys and sodas for a group of rowdy colleagues on a Friday afternoon, the door swung open with a burst of rain-soaked air, and a figure stood tall in the entrance - their eyes locking onto Kae's across the crowded room.
