Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Paris were always at their most romantic on nights like these, when the City of Light was veiled in a misty shroud of grey and the Eiffel Tower stood sentinel over the sleeping city. Inside the luxurious Hotel Le Ciel, where the wealthy elite came to indulge in the finer things in life, concierge Aurélien Dumont stood watchful vigil, his eyes scanning the lobby with a practiced air of attention.

As he smoothed out a crease on his crisp black uniform, a lone figure emerged from the downpour, shaking the rain from their coat like a dog. Aurélien's gaze narrowed slightly as he took in the stranger's features - a mop of unruly brown hair, a scattering of freckles across the bridge of their nose, and eyes that seemed to hold a world of secrets within them.

"Welcome to Hotel Le Ciel," Aurélien said with a bow, his voice smooth as silk. "May I be of assistance?"

The stranger's gaze flickered up to meet his, and for a moment, Aurélien felt a jolt of electricity run through the air - as if the very fate of this chance encounter hung precariously in the balance.

"What can I help you with?" Aurélien asked again, his curiosity piqued by the enigmatic stranger's gaze.
