Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Red Oak, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and worn buildings. The air was thick with the smell of freshly cut wood and the distant hum of chainsaws could be heard echoing through the forest, where 35-year-old Ryder Jackson was hard at work.

Ryder had spent his entire life working as a logger, just like his father and grandfather before him. He knew every inch of these woods, from the towering pines to the dense cedars, and had an uncanny ability to navigate the treacherous terrain with ease. But despite his rugged exterior, Ryder was haunted by a tragedy that had occurred on this very land several years ago.

That night, a fire had swept through the forest, fueled by lightning and strong winds, leaving nothing but charred remains in its wake. The Jackson family's logging business had been destroyed, and three members of Ryder's family had lost their lives in the blaze. The pain and guilt still lingered, and Ryder couldn't shake the feeling that he was somehow responsible for the tragedy.

As he worked tirelessly to prepare the forest for another season of harvesting, Ryder couldn't help but wonder if this year would be any different. Would the ghosts of his past finally rest easy, or would the cycle of violence repeat itself?
