Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel:

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished stone as Emilia Helena MacKenzie trudged wearily through the door of her small flat, shaking the grey mist from her coat. She had spent the better part of the day holed up in the local café, scribbling away on her laptop and trying to coax some semblance of coherence out of the jumbled thoughts that plagued her.

The rain lashed against the panes like a chorus of restless spirits, casting eerie shadows across the walls. It was nights like these that made her feel most alive – as if the very darkness itself held secrets waiting to be unlocked.

Emilia took a deep breath, letting the chill air fill her lungs, and made her way to the kitchenette to start a pot of tea. She had been working on a new novel for months now, pouring her heart and soul into the story of a reclusive writer who uncovers a mysterious manuscript hidden away in the depths of Edinburgh's ancient libraries.

It belonged to her late grandmother, a renowned writer in her own right who had always encouraged Emilia to follow her dreams. The worn cover was adorned with cryptic notes and sketches that seemed to hold secrets of their own.

Emilia's fingers itched to open the book, to unravel its tangled threads and let the stories within spill onto the page like blood from a wound. But something held her back – perhaps it was the nagging sense that this story was meant for someone else, or that it was already half-written in some other world.

Whatever the reason, Emilia knew she couldn't stay away from the notebook forever. As the kettle began to whistle and the room filled with the scent of steaming tea, she took a seat at her desk, opened the book, and let the words begin to flow...
