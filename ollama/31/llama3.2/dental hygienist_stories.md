Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the sleepy coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint beachside streets and homes. In her small apartment above the local surf shop, Emily Mae Jensen was scrubbing away at a particularly stubborn plaque on a patient's tooth in her dental hygiene practice. The sound of seagulls and the faint hum of the ocean waves created a soothing background noise that usually calmed her nerves, but today she felt a sense of unease.

As she rinsed out the solution and applied a fresh coat of antibacterial mouthwash, Emily Mae couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the patient's unusual behavior or the strange smell wafting from the old beachside shack that had been recently restored to its former glory - it was the sense that she was being watched.

She glanced out the window, where the fading light of day revealed a silhouette standing on the edge of the porch. For a moment, Emily Mae thought it might be her best friend and confidant, Rachel Lee, who was supposed to meet her for dinner at 5 pm. But as the figure took a step closer, its features became clearer: it was Jack Harris, the gruff but lovable local fisherman whose smile could charm the shells off the beach.

What was Jack doing here, and what did he want? Emily Mae's instincts were telling her to be wary, but she pushed aside her doubts and headed downstairs to answer the door. Little did she know that this chance encounter would set off a chain of events that would change her life forever.
