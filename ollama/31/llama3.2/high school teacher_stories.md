Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a golden glow over the quaint streets and homes that lined the Main Street. In a cozy little house on Elmwood Drive, a sense of unease settled over 35-year-old Emilia Rose Thompson as she unpacked her lunchbox from the fridge. As a high school English teacher at Willow Creek High School, Emilia had grown accustomed to the humdrum routine of the weekdays, but tonight felt different. Maybe it was the way the darkness seemed to press in on her from all sides, or perhaps it was the strange dream she'd had earlier that evening - one where she stood in front of a classroom full of empty chairs, her words lost on an audience of silent faces.

Either way, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She took a deep breath and tried to focus on the familiar comfort of her kitchen, the smell of fresh-brewed coffee wafting from the pot she'd left simmering all morning. But as she turned to grab a glass of water from the sink, her eyes caught sight of a piece of paper tacked to the fridge door - a note scrawled in hasty handwriting that read: "Meet me at school tonight at 8pm. Come alone."
