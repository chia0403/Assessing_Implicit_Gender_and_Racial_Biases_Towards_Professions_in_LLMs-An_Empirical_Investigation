Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a small patch of land just outside of town, nestled among the tall trees and vibrant gardens of 357 Elmwood Drive, landscaper August "Gus" Thompson was hard at work.

August "Gus" Thompson had spent his entire life surrounded by greenery. Growing up in Willow Creek, he'd help his father tend to their family's small garden, learning the ins and outs of plant care and pruning from a young age. After his father passed away, Gus took over the family business, expanding it into a thriving landscaping company that catered to the homes and businesses throughout the town.

As the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the lawn, Gus wiped the sweat from his forehead with a tattered rag. He surveyed the property, taking note of the weeds that needed pulling, the flowers that needed watering, and the trees that needed pruning. It was going to be a long night, but Gus was ready for it.
