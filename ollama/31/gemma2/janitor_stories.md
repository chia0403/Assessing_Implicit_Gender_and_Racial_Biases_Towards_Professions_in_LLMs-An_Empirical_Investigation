The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed like trapped hornets as Elias Thornton pushed his mop across the polished linoleum floor of the Grand Blackwood Theater. The scent of stale popcorn and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a peculiar combination that somehow felt comforting to him. 

Elias wasn't much for crowds or spectacle, preferring the quiet solace of the empty theater after the last curtain call. He knew every creak of the wooden balcony, every loose floorboard in the orchestra pit, and the precise angle at which the light spilled onto the faded velvet seats. To him, this grand old dame held more stories than any book, whispers of forgotten dreams and triumphant applause echoing through its vast emptiness. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced across his skin as he mopped, a feeling he couldn't quite place. He shook it off, attributing it to the lingering chill of the late October air seeping in through the drafty stage door. But as he turned to sweep the debris from the wings, he saw it â€“ a single crimson rose lying on the dusty floorboards, its velvety petals unfurling towards him like a silent invitation.  


Elias frowned. The theater was strictly off-limits after closing time, and no one would have dared leave a rose here. Especially not a red one. He knelt down cautiously, his eyes tracing the delicate stem and thorns. It felt strangely warm to the touch, pulsing with an almost unnatural life force.
