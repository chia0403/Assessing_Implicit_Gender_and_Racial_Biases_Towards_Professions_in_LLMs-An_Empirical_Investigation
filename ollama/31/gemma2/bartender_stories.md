The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and regret, a familiar perfume in "Rusty's," the grimy dive bar tucked away on the wrong side of town.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon sign that flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows across the sticky floor. Behind the bar, Elara Rosethorn, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a messy bun and a perpetually exasperated expression, wiped down a chipped mug with a rag stained darker than sin.  She was used to this; the low hum of conversation punctuated by bursts of drunken laughter, the clinking of glasses, the occasional sob swallowed into another whiskey shot. 

But tonight felt different. There was a tension in the air, a prickle of anticipation that even the rain couldn't wash away. Elara caught a glimpse of herself in the dusty mirror behind the bar - her emerald eyes narrowed with suspicion, her jaw set tight.  She wasn't sure what was coming, but she had a feeling it wouldn't be pleasant.
