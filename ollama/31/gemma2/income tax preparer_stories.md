The stale scent of coffee and desperation hung thick in the air, clinging to Beatrice "Bea" Evelyn Prescott like a second skin.  Her cramped office, tucked away on the third floor of a nondescript brick building in downtown Trenton, was a symphony of whirring printers, frantic keyboard clicks, and muffled cries of "Are you sure that's right?" Bea herself, perched behind a desk piled high with tax forms, looked like she hadn't slept in days. Her normally vibrant red hair was pulled back in a tight bun, her eyes were bloodshot, and the faint scent of peppermint oil did little to mask the exhaustion radiating from her pores. 

Bea wasn't your typical income tax preparer. While others saw it as a temporary gig, Bea considered it an art form, a delicate dance between numbers, legalities, and the often-hidden stories whispered through financial documents. She prided herself on her ability to unravel even the most convoluted tax returns, bringing order to chaos and justice (and sometimes just a few extra dollars) to her clients. But this year felt different. The air buzzed with a palpable tension, a sense of unease that seeped into every corner of her office, mirroring the anxieties swirling in the minds of her clientele.


The late March sun cast long shadows across the cracked pavement outside as Bea glanced at the clock. It was 10:45 pm and she was already running two hours behind schedule. Her heart ached for her own family - her husband David, patiently waiting dinner at home, and her daughter Lily, who would be disappointed not to have bedtime stories with their beloved "Tax Lady" tonight. But Bea couldn't leave, not until the last form was filed, the last story heard, the last client reassured that even in this turbulent world, things could still add up.
