The air hung thick with the scent of oil and burnt rubber, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of wrenches against metal. Grease stained every surface in Silas Remington's workshop, from the rafters to the cracked linoleum floor. A single bare bulb cast a dim yellow glow over the jumble of tools and parts scattered across his workbench, illuminating the face of a man whose own life seemed as worn and battered as the cars he resurrected.

Silas, with grease smudged on his calloused hands and a tired weariness etched around his eyes, leaned against the hood of a 1967 Mustang, its faded cherry red paint a testament to past glories. He traced a finger along the dented fender, remembering the stories whispered about this car – the joyrides, the late-night races, the heartbreaks it had witnessed. Now, it sat before him, a carcass begging for his touch.

The bell above the workshop door jingled, interrupting Silas's reverie. He wiped his hands on a rag and straightened, his gaze fixed on the figure that entered, shrouded in the shadows of the late afternoon sun. The air crackled with unspoken tension, a feeling that was all too familiar to Silas.  Something about this new arrival – a woman with eyes as dark as engine oil and a presence that seemed both alluring and dangerous – promised trouble.
