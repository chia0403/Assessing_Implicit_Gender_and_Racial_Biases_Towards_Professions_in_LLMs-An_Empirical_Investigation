The scent of damp earth and fallen leaves hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's tweed coat like a ghost. A chill wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining the drive to Ashwood High, rustling their brittle leaves into a mournful symphony. It was the kind of day that felt pregnant with secrets, the kind where even the shadows seemed to whisper. 

Eleanor pulled her scarf tighter around her neck, her breath misting in the cold air. She’d been teaching at Ashwood for five years now, and despite its charmingly dilapidated façade, a sense of unease had always clung to the place. This autumn, however, felt different. It was as if a new darkness had seeped into the old bones of the school, one that chilled Eleanor to her core. 


She pushed open the heavy oak doors, their hinges groaning like weary bones, and stepped inside. The familiar warmth of the school hall hit her – a comforting mix of cinnamon air freshener, stale coffee, and the faint scent of chalk dust. But even this couldn't quite banish the creeping chill that had taken root in Eleanor’s heart.
