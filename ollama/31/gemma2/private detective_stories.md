The rain was relentless, drumming a mournful tattoo on the awning above Detective Alistair Finch’s office. A thick fog hung low in the alley behind his building, muffling the city’s usual cacophony and swallowing the neon signs in a hazy, monochrome embrace. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and despair – a familiar perfume in this part of town. 

Finch, a man carved from shadows and cigarettes, sat hunched over his desk, a half-eaten sandwich abandoned beside him. His eyes, perpetually shadowed by the brim of his fedora, were glued to the case file laid out before him: "Missing Person - Amelia Thorne." A single photograph, its edges curling with age, stared back at him – a young woman with vibrant green eyes and a smile that seemed to promise sunshine even in this dreary setting. 


Amelia’s disappearance was just another name on a long list for Finch, but something about the case tugged at him. Perhaps it was the unsettling emptiness of her vacant apartment, or maybe it was the desperation etched into the face of her brother when he'd delivered the file. Whatever it was, Finch felt a familiar pull, that nagging sense of duty that kept him wading through the murky depths of this city’s underbelly. This time, he wouldn’t rest until he found Amelia Thorne, even if it meant facing down the shadows lurking in every corner of his own soul.
