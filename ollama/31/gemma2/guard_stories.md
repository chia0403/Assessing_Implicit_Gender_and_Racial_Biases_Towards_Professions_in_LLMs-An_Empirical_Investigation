The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the cobblestone streets of Veridian City. Rain, a relentless drizzle that had become almost as common as the city's ever-present smog, slicked the stones and made them gleam like polished obsidian. A biting wind whipped around Seraphina Thorne, tugging at her woolen cloak and sending shivers down her spine despite the thick layers of armor beneath. She pulled her collar tighter, trying to ward off the chill that seemed to seep into her bones. 

Seraphina, a veteran guard in Veridian Cityâ€™s renowned Crimson Guard, scanned the shadowy alleyways with practiced vigilance. Her years on patrol had taught her to be wary of the darkness, aware that even the smallest flicker could hide a lurking threat. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling unease crawled beneath her skin, urging her to step up her vigilance, to be ready for anything.  


What she didn't know was that tonight, Veridian City wouldn't just face the usual petty crime and street brawls. Tonight, a shadow far darker would begin to rise.
