The afternoon sun beat down on Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne’s shoulders as she navigated the overgrown front yard of 14 Elmwood Drive.  Wisteria vines, thick as pythons, choked the wrought iron fence, and the welcome mat sagged like a deflated balloon under its own dust. This wasn't exactly the kind of listing that graced Amelia's usual portfolio of pristine penthouse suites and sprawling suburban manors.  This was… well, this was a fixer-upper, a project house with more potential than practicality. But Amelia, ever the optimist, saw possibilities where others saw problems. She envisioned freshly painted walls, manicured lawns, and a charming garden bursting with color. 

The house itself loomed before her, two stories of peeling paint and faded grandeur. Its vacant windows stared back like empty sockets, promising untold secrets within their dark depths. Amelia took a deep breath, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and forgotten dreams. 


This was going to be interesting.
