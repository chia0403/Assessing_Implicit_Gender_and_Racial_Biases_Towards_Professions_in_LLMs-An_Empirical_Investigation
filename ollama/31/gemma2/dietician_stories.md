The aroma of roasted chickpeas and turmeric drifted through the air, mingling with the metallic scent of disinfectant that always seemed to linger in Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s tiny clinic. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its golden beams. 

Amelia sighed, adjusting the small stethoscope around her neck.  Her morning session had been cancelled – again – leaving her with a quiet office and an unsettling feeling of unease. She wasn't used to empty waiting rooms, not since she'd started catering to the dietary needs of actors prepping for grueling roles in Hollywood’s demanding film industry. 

But this morning felt different.  The silence was heavier, thicker than usual. Amelia ran a hand through her auburn hair, feeling the familiar tension knotting at the base of her skull. It wasn't just the cancelled appointment; something else lurked beneath the surface, a disquiet that pricked at her like a persistent itch. 


This wasn't just another day in the life of Amelia Rose Hawthorne, dietician extraordinaire, this was…different. She could feel it in her bones.
