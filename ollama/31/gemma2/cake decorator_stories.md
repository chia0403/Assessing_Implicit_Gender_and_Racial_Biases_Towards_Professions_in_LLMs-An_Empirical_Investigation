The aroma of vanilla bean and buttercream hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the biting November wind whistling through the cracks in Amelia "Amy" Roseberry's window. Outside, the bustling streets of Chicago were already draped in holiday cheer - twinkling lights strung across buildings, carolers weaving their way through crowds, and the scent of roasted chestnuts filling every corner. Inside Amy’s cozy bakery, "Flour Power," the air was thick with a different kind of magic – the magic of sugar and spice, whipped cream and fondant, transforming ordinary cakes into edible works of art. 

Amy, her blonde braid dusted with flour, surveyed her latest creation: a towering five-tier masterpiece destined for the grand opening of the city's newest luxury hotel. It was a magnificent thing, cascading tiers of chocolate ganache adorned with delicate sugar flowers and handcrafted replicas of miniature champagne flutes.  But even as Amy admired her work, a nagging worry gnawed at her – the bakery’s finances were precarious, and this commission wasn’t enough to pull them out of their slump.   

This cake, more than just frosting and flour, was Amy's last hope.
