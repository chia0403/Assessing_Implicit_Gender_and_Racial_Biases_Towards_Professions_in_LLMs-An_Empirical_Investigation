The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eleanor Claire Montgomery's scrubs like a second skin. Outside, the Chicago skyline glittered with the promise of a Friday night, but inside Mercy General Hospital, it was always Friday night – a symphony of beeps, shouts, and the rhythmic gurgle of IV drips. Ellie, as her colleagues affectionately called her, navigated the crowded hallways, her worn-out sneakers slapping against the linoleum floor. Her name tag, pinned haphazardly above her pocket, read "RN Montgomery," but to those she treated, it was simply "Angel" – a title she wore with a weary grace, earned through years of tending to the city's broken and battered souls. 

Tonight, however, felt different. The usual Friday night chaos was heightened, a palpable tension buzzing beneath the surface like a live wire waiting to be touched. Ellie’s gut churned, an unsettling premonition settling in her chest. Something big was about to happen.
