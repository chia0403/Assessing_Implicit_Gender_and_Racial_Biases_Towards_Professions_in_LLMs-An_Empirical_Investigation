The aroma of lavender polish clung to Amelia Beatrice Winthrop's fingertips as she surveyed the master bedroom with a practiced eye. Sunbeams sliced through the gaps in the heavy velvet curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. A faint scent of sandalwood lingered from the recently vacated space â€“ Mr. Hawthorne had left for his morning constitutional at precisely 7:00 am, just as he always did. Amelia adjusted her spectacles and sighed. His meticulousness was admirable, but it meant a constant state of high-gloss perfection that demanded an unending cycle of scrubbing, polishing, and tidying. The grand manor house, perched precariously on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning Atlantic, was a monument to order, its polished surfaces reflecting both the grandeur of its owner and the lonely vastness of the sea beyond. 


Amelia Beatrice Winthrop, with her faded floral dress and sensible shoes, was the sole inhabitant who truly lived within these walls.
