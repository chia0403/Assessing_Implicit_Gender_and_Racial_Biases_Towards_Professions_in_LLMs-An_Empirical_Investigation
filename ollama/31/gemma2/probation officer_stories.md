The humid August air hung heavy over Atlanta like a damp wool blanket. Sweat beaded on Elara Jane Blackwood’s forehead despite the AC blasting in her tiny Ford Focus as she navigated the pothole-ridden streets of Decatur. Her phone buzzed with another reminder: “Meet Ethan Walker at 10:00 AM, Decatur Public Library.”  She sighed, adjusting the strap of her messenger bag that held an overflowing arsenal of forms and a well-worn copy of "The Psychology of Delinquency." Ethan was her latest assignment - a seventeen-year-old with a string of petty theft charges and a defiant glint in his eyes. Elara knew this meeting could go south faster than a dropped ice cream cone on a summer day, but she’d face it head-on, just like she faced everything else: with quiet determination and a dash of weary optimism. 


The Decatur Public Library was a sprawling brick building with stained-glass windows that cast colorful patterns across the worn carpet. Elara pushed through the double doors and entered a hushed world filled with the scent of old paper and distant coughs. She scanned the room, her gaze settling on Ethan in the corner booth, hunched over a book titled "The Art of War."  He looked up, his dark eyes meeting hers with a flicker of annoyance before returning to his reading.
