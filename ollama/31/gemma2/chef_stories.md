The steam from the simmering tomato sauce hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Dubois' apron like a damp shroud.  Her small restaurant, tucked away on a cobbled side street in Florence, was named "La Cucina di Sogno," The Kitchen of Dreams. A fitting name, Amy thought wryly, considering the dreams she had poured into this tiny space – and the nightmares that sometimes seemed to seep from the heart of it. 

It was Sunday evening, usually a busy time for La Cucina, but tonight felt different. The air was thick with an unspoken tension, a kind of hushed anticipation that prickled at Amy's skin.  The few diners who were present spoke in hushed tones, their eyes darting nervously around the room. 

Across the street, a solitary figure stood silhouetted against the warm glow of a nearby lamppost. He was watching La Cucina with an unnerving intensity, his gaze fixed on Amy as she moved through the kitchen like a whirlwind, preparing her signature dish – a rustic Tuscan ragu that had become legendary in Florence. 


His presence, so palpable even from across the street, made Amy's heart beat faster. She couldn't shake the feeling that tonight was about to become something more than just another Sunday supper.
