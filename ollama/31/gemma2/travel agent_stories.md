The air hung thick with jasmine and the smell of sizzling street food as Amelia Brighton surveyed the bustling market square from her perch on the rooftop terrace. Below, vendors hawked their wares in rapid-fire Hindi, tourists haggled over prices, and stray dogs weaved between legs, sniffing for scraps. This was Jaipur, India â€“ a city that pulsed with vibrant chaos, a world away from Amelia's quiet life back in Edinburgh.

She wasn't on holiday, though. Amelia, despite her yearning for adventure, was here on business. A travel agent by trade, she had built a successful career crafting bespoke itineraries for discerning clients. But this trip was different. It was a personal mission: to find the perfect location for her own future escape, a place where she could finally shed the shackles of responsibility and embrace the unknown.

The phone vibrated in her pocket, pulling Amelia back from her musings. A client, eager for details about his upcoming safari in Tanzania.  Amelia sighed. While she dreamt of far-flung lands, reality often held clients demanding itineraries filled with luxury hotels and five-star restaurants. 


She flipped open the phone, a smile gracing her lips despite the weariness that had settled in her bones. It was time to get back to work, but for now, Amelia savored the intoxicating energy of Jaipur, hoping it would somehow whisper secrets of its own into her soul.
