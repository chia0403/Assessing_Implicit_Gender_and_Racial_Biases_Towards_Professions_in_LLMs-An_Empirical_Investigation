The sun, a fat orange yolk sizzling on the horizon, painted the dew-laden fields in hues of gold and crimson.  Elowen Thistlewick, her weathered hands already calloused from a morning spent coaxing life from the stubborn soil, inhaled deeply. The air, crisp and earthy, carried the scent of damp earth and ripening apples. It was a smell she'd come to cherish, as familiar and comforting as her grandmother's worn woolen shawl.

Her small farm, nestled in the heart of the rolling hills of Alderwood Valley, had been in her family for generations.  It was a place where life moved at its own pace, dictated by the seasons and the whims of nature. The valley itself, with its patchwork quilt of fields and ancient woodlands, felt both timeless and fragile, a sanctuary threatened by whispers of change drifting in from the bustling city beyond the hills. 


Elowen knew the whispers were growing louder, but for now, she was content to lose herself in the familiar rhythm of her days â€“ tending her crops, gathering eggs from her clucking hens, and brewing fragrant pots of chamomile tea under the watchful gaze of the ancient oaks that lined her garden path.
