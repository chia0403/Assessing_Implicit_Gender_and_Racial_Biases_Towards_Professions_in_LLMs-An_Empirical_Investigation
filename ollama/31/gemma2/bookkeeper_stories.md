The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice Amelia Finchley's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over her meticulously organized spreadsheets. Numbers danced in her peripheral vision, swirling like phantoms as she wrestled with the discrepancies in Mr. Fitzwilliam's expense report. His "research trip" to Paris seemed to involve more champagne than scholarly manuscripts, judging by the invoices for overpriced wine and exorbitantly priced pastries. Beatrice sighed, tapping her pen against her teeth. 

Beatrice Amelia Finchley was a woman of routine. Every morning at precisely 8:15, she'd arrive at Fitzwilliam & Sons Limited, a quaint antique shop nestled on a cobblestone street in Bath, England. She’d greet Mr. Fitzwilliam with a polite nod and settle into her corner office, the smell of old parchment and polished wood clinging to the air like a familiar embrace. Her life was a symphony of ledgers and invoices, receipts and reports, each figure neatly categorized and meticulously balanced.  But lately, Beatrice felt a tremor in the predictable rhythm, a dissonance in the harmony she had so carefully cultivated. 


Mr. Fitzwilliam's recent behavior was becoming increasingly erratic, his requests for funds more outlandish, his expense claims wilder. And the whispers from the other shop assistants – about strange deliveries arriving after dark, and hushed conversations with shadowy figures in the back room – only added to Beatrice's unease.
