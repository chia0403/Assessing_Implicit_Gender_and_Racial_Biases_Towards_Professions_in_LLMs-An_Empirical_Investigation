The air hung thick with humidity and anticipation in the fluorescent-lit studio.  Sweat beaded on Amelia "Amy" Rosewater's brow as she adjusted her yoga mat, its lavender scent battling against the faint tang of chlorine from the pool next door. The rhythmic thump of electropop pulsed through the speakers, a counterpoint to the nervous rustling of clothing and the hurried breaths of the twenty bodies stretching around her. Amy inhaled deeply, steeling herself for another 60 minutes of high-intensity bootcamp mayhem.  Her smile was wide, almost manic, as she addressed the group, "Welcome back, warriors! Tonight, we conquer Mount Kilimanjaro...well, sort of." 


The setting is a crowded, moderately upscale fitness studio in a bustling suburb just outside of a major city.
