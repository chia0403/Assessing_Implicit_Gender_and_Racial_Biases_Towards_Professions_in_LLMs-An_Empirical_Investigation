The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over her meticulously organized desk.  Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated like miniature galaxies by the harsh glow. Outside, the relentless summer heat pressed against the windows of the fifth-floor office, making the room feel more like a sauna than a place of business. 

Eleanor, a woman whose life revolved around spreadsheets and debits, sighed as she stared at the mountain of tax forms piled before her. Each one represented a story – a family struggling to make ends meet, a freelancer chasing their dreams, a corporation ruthlessly maximizing profits. But right now, they just looked like an insurmountable obstacle. She rubbed her temples, trying to banish the throbbing headache that always seemed to accompany deadlines. This year felt particularly oppressive; perhaps it was the looming threat of the company merger, or maybe the fact that her niece had moved in after a messy breakup with her fiancé.  Whatever the reason, Eleanor just wanted a break from the relentless monotony.


She glanced at the clock – 4:57 p.m. Just three minutes until freedom. Maybe she could squeeze in a quick walk around the block before heading home to cook dinner for her niece and try to distract her with some badly needed retail therapy.  For the next three minutes, Eleanor would be a prisoner of her spreadsheets, but soon, she'd be back in control of her own narrative.
