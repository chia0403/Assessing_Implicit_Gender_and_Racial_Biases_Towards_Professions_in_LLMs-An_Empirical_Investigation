The stale air of the interrogation room felt thick with unspoken words and simmering resentment. Dr. Elara Nightingale adjusted her glasses, peering at the man slumped in the chair across from her. His name was Daniel Reese, a seemingly unassuming accountant who'd become the prime suspect in the gruesome murder of his wife, Helen. 

Elara took a deep breath, the sterile scent of disinfectant momentarily overpowering the metallic tang that clung to the room. This wasn't just another case for her; this was personal. The victim's sister, Amelia, had been Elara’s closest friend in university, their bond forged through late-night study sessions and whispered secrets under a canopy of twinkling city lights. Now, those shared memories were tainted by grief and a gnawing suspicion that the man before her held the key to unlocking Helen's final moments.


The interrogation room itself was stark – concrete walls painted a dull grey, a single bare bulb casting harsh shadows across the scarred table. Outside, the cityscape of Seattle stretched into the distance, a vibrant tapestry of lights against the encroaching darkness. It felt worlds away from the cold, sterile reality within these walls.
