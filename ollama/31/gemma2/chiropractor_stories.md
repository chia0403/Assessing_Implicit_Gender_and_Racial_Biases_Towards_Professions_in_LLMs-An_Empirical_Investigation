The aroma of eucalyptus oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the crisp November chill that seeped through the cracks in Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Thorne's practice. Outside, the wind rattled the frosted windows of her charming brick building nestled on Maple Street, but inside, warmth radiated from the crackling fireplace and the soft hum of ambient music. 

Evelyn adjusted the height of the treatment table with practiced ease, its worn wood polished smooth by years of patient care.  A gentle smile played on her lips as she prepared for her next appointment - a young artist named Leo with chronic back pain brought on by hours hunched over his canvas. Evelyn knew that feeling all too well; her own passion for healing had started with a yearning to mend not just bodies, but the creative spirits that fueled them. 


The soft chime of the door announcing a new arrival broke the silence, pulling Evelyn's focus back to the present. "Come on in," she called out, her voice warm and inviting.
