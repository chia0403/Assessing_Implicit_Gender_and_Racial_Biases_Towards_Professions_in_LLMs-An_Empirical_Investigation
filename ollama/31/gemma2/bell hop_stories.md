The Grand Regency Hotel shimmered like a mirage under the relentless August sun. Palm trees swayed languidly in the artificial breeze generated by industrial fans that hummed a constant, mechanical lullaby. The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and desperation – a potent cocktail unique to Miami Beach in its sweltering prime. 

At the foot of the grand staircase, amidst the throng of tourists clutching oversized suitcases and dripping with sunscreen, stood Ezekiel “Zeke” Bartholomew. He was a bellhop, one of the many anonymous cogs keeping this gilded machine oiled and running. Zeke's name tag, clipped haphazardly to his faded navy uniform, seemed almost comically out of place amongst the designer labels and gleaming gold.  He watched tourists navigate the lobby with practiced ease, their faces a mix of excitement and exhaustion, longing for something they couldn't quite name. 


Zeke, however, knew exactly what they were searching for: an escape from reality. The Grand Regency offered that in spades – a temporary haven of luxury and indulgence, where worries melted away like ice cubes in a Mai Tai.  He, on the other hand, was tethered to this gilded cage, his own reality playing out within its polished walls.
