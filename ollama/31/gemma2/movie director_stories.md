The stale smell of popcorn hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of sweat and anticipation. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, known professionally as simply “Beatrice,” adjusted her crimson silk dress, feeling the weight of hundreds of eyes on her back. The premiere of her latest film, "The Obsidian Mirror," was about to begin. 

The setting: a grand, old theater in Los Angeles – the Egyptian Theatre, built in 1922 with ornate hieroglyphics adorning its facade and plush red velvet seats that whispered secrets from decades past.  Beatrice had chosen this venue meticulously, wanting the historical grandeur to mirror the epic scope of her film, a gothic thriller set in Victorian England. A storm raged outside, lashing against the windows like clawing claws, adding an air of foreboding to the already charged atmosphere.

Beatrice took a deep breath, steeling herself for the barrage of criticism, praise, and everything in between that would come with this night. This film was her heart and soul, poured onto celluloid after years of struggle. The success or failure of "The Obsidian Mirror" felt like a referendum on her entire career.  As the lights dimmed, Beatrice cast one last glance at the expectant audience, a sea of faces illuminated by the soft glow of their phones. 


She gripped the armrest, knuckles white, and prayed this storm wouldn't wash away everything she had built.
