The late October air in Oakhaven was crisp with the scent of fallen leaves and woodsmoke.  Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Hawthorne adjusted her fleece-lined jacket as she pulled into the dusty parking lot of the Animal Haven Clinic. The setting sun cast long shadows across the weathered wood siding, highlighting the chipped paint and faded welcome sign that hung precariously above the entrance. Inside, the familiar smells of disinfectant and animal fur mingled with a faint whiff of burnt toast - a reminder that Mrs. Peabody's beloved ginger tabby, Marmalade, had recently taken to using the toaster oven as his personal plaything. 

Evie sighed, pushing open the creaky door. Another day in paradise. 


Her pager buzzed just then, demanding her attention. It was Dr. Lewis, the clinicâ€™s owner and Evie's mentor. "Bring whatever emergency supplies you can find," it read. "It's a bad one."

A shiver of apprehension ran down Evie's spine. Oakhaven wasn't known for its abundance of exotic creatures or complicated veterinary emergencies. Whatever Dr. Lewis was facing, it promised to be unusual indeed.
