The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Amy" Harper like a second skin as she walked into the bustling clinic.  Her stethoscope, heavy around her neck, felt more like an anchor than a tool in this stifling heat.  Everywhere she looked, patients were moving – some with practiced ease, others with hesitant steps and grimaces of pain. Amy's clinic, "Harper's Healing Hands," was a beacon of hope in the small town of Savannah Springs, offering its residents everything from sports recovery to post-stroke rehabilitation. 

Today, though, the usual symphony of clanging weights and whirring machines felt muted. A sense of unease hung in the air, as if a storm was brewing, not just outside but within the walls of the clinic itself. Amy wasn't sure what it was – perhaps it was the unusually quiet hallway, or maybe it was the knowing glances she exchanged with her colleagues – but something felt off.  As she approached her office, a handwritten note on the door caught her eye. It simply read: "Meet me in the break room. Urgent." 

Amy's brow furrowed.  This wasn't like Dr. Evans, their long-time physical medicine specialist. He was always punctual and direct, never one for cryptic messages. She took a deep breath and stepped into the break room, her heart pounding with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension.
