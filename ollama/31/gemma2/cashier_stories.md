The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thorne's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of "Bargain Bonanza."  Each aisle was a battlefield of discounted goods: towering stacks of tarnished silverware, chipped china, and plush toys with mismatched eyes stared up at her from their cardboard thrones. The scent of mothballs and stale popcorn hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder that everything in this place was fighting its last battle against obsolescence.

Amelia, perched on her stool behind the dusty register, tapped her acrylic nails impatiently against the chipped Formica. Another long afternoon stretched before her, filled with ringing up discount toaster ovens and fielding complaints about expired coupon codes from customers who clearly hadn't read the fine print. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new customer - a tall woman draped in a purple paisley shawl, clutching a tattered paperback beneath one arm.  Amelia felt a flicker of hope. Maybe this time, it wouldn't be another round of bargain bin blues.
