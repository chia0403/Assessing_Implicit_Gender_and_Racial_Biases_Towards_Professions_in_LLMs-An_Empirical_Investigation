The rhythmic whir of the automated laser cutter was Amelia Beatrice Finch’s white noise.  She squinted at the holographic projection displaying the blueprint for the new solar farm, a sprawling network of panels stretching across a hundred acres of reclaimed desert land.  Sweat prickled on her brow despite the cool air conditioning humming through the drafting studio. It wasn't just the heat from the lasers; Amelia was working under pressure.

The company’s CEO had made it clear: this solar farm needed to be finished by next month, rain or shine, and Amelia, with her reputation for meticulous detail and swift execution, was their only hope. 


Amelia adjusted her spectacles, pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear, and dove back into the intricate lines of the blueprint, each curve representing a panel placement, each intersection a potential point of failure. Her studio, a small alcove within the sprawling complex of New Dawn Industries, was bathed in the soft blue glow of the holographic display and the warm hum of machinery. Outside, the Arizona desert stretched as far as the eye could see, a vast expanse of cracked earth and scrub brush under the relentless sun.
