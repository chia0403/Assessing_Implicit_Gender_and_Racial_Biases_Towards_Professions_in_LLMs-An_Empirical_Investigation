The rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Grace Hawthorne's heels against the polished oak floor was the only sound breaking the sterile silence of her office.  Rain lashed against the panoramic window behind her, blurring the Seattle skyline into an impressionist painting of greys and blues. Outside, the city pulsed with a frenetic energy she couldn't quite fathom, but within these walls, Amelia found solace in the calm predictability of her work as a counseling psychologist. Today, however, a peculiar unease settled in her chest, a premonition she couldn't shake off. It was amplified by the unfamiliar scent lingering in the air - a hint of lavender and something metallic, like old pennies unearthed after a storm.  The first appointment of the day hadnâ€™t been scheduled yet, so Amelia chalked it up to nerves.

She adjusted her glasses, their thick lenses magnifying the anxious flicker in her own reflection. The office door clicked open, breaking the silence. A tall figure, shrouded in a long dark coat, stepped inside, the scent intensifying as they moved closer. 


"Dr. Hawthorne?" Their voice was low and gravelly, sending another shiver down Amelia's spine. "My name is Elias Thorne."
