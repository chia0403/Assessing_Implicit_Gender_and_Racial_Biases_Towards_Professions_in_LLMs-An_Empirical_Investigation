The morning sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Finnigan's neck as he squinted at the blueprints spread across the dusty plywood table. He wiped his brow with a calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. The air hung thick with the smell of sweat, sawdust, and the faint metallic tang of welding fumes. 

Around him, the construction site buzzed with activity. Men in hard hats scurried about like ants, carrying lumber, hammering nails, and maneuvering heavy machinery with practiced ease. This wasn't Bart's first rodeo; he'd been building skyscrapers since he was old enough to hold a hammer, but even after all these years, the raw energy of the site never failed to electrify him. 

Today, they were working on the skeleton of the "Emerald Tower," a gleaming behemoth that promised to pierce the clouds and become the city's newest landmark. Bart was part of the team responsible for erecting the steel beams that would form the tower's backbone, a task both exhilarating and terrifying in equal measure.  


He glanced at the towering stack of I-beams beside him, their cold, metallic surfaces reflecting the harsh sunlight. A knot of apprehension tightened in his stomach. This wasn't just another day on the job; this was Bart's chance to leave his mark on the city, to build something truly magnificent.  But as he looked up at the dizzying height they were already reaching, a voice whispered in his ear: "How far are you willing to go?"
