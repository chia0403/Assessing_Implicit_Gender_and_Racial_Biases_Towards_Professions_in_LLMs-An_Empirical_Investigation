The July sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat stinging his eyes as he maneuvered another sheet of metal across the steep slope of Mrs. Peterson's Victorian mansion. His calloused hands gripped the tar-stained edge, muscles burning in protest after hours spent battling the unforgiving heat and precariously balancing on the roof’s ridge line.  

The grand old house, perched atop a hill overlooking the sprawling town of Willow Creek, was Eli's current project. A labyrinth of dorms, turrets, and intricate gables, it had been his father's favorite assignment, filled with the ghosts of generations past and whispering secrets carried on the wind. 


Eli paused, wiping his brow with a grimy rag. The town sprawled before him like a patchwork quilt, fields of sunflowers turning gold in the afternoon light, dotted with the red-tiled roofs of houses, the silver gleam of the river winding its way through it all.  Willow Creek was steeped in tradition, a place where time seemed to move slower, and secrets were whispered on porch swings beneath the shade of ancient oaks. 

He took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass, letting the familiar landscape ground him. It was home, his father's legacy, and a world he knew intimately – a world that was about to get a whole lot more complicated.
