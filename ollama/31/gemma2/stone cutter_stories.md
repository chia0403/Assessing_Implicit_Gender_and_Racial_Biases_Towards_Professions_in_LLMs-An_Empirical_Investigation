The air hung thick with the dust of granite, swirling in motes of sunlight that pierced the gloom of Elias Thorne's workshop.  He wiped his brow with a grimy sleeve, leaving streaks across his tanned skin. The rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel filled the small space, punctuated by the occasional curse muttered under Elias' breath as he worked. 

Elias was not just any stone cutter; his craft was more than mere shaping and polishing. He had an uncanny ability to see within the rough slabs of granite, to envision the stories they held, the lives they might embody once freed from their earthly prison.  His workshop, nestled in the heart of a bustling market town on the edge of a whispering forest, hummed with this quiet magic. It was a sanctuary where stone whispered secrets and Elias listened, his chisel a conduit for their ancient tales.

Etched into its surface was a glyph unlike any he had seen before, swirling like smoke against the dark stone. It pulsed with an unsettling energy, calling to him with a silent, insistent voice.
