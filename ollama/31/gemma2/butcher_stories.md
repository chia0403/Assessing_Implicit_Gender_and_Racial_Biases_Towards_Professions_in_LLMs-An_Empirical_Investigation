The morning mist clung to Butcherton like a damp shroud, obscuring the cobblestone streets and making the already quaint village appear even more ethereal. A rooster crowed somewhere in the distance, its mournful call swallowed by the silence that hung heavy in the air. Inside his shop, "William 'Billy' Bartholomew's Provisions & Meats," Billy Bartholomew was wrestling with a particularly stubborn slab of beef brisket. 

Sweat beaded on his forehead as he coaxed the blade through the tough sinew, the rhythmic thud of the cleaver against bone echoing through the empty shop. The scent of blood and iron mingled with the tang of salt from the cured meats hanging from the rafters, a familiar aroma that Billy had come to associate with both comfort and fear. 

Butcherton wasn't a place for the faint of heart. Its inhabitants were as rough around the edges as the blades Billy wielded, their lives carved by tradition and hardship. And Billy, despite his gentle demeanor and surprisingly poetic butcher's rhymes, was no stranger to either.
