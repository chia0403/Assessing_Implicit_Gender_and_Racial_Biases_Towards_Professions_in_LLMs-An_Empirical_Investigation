The air in the Bellagio lobby hummed with hushed conversations, clinking champagne flutes, and the faint scent of lilies. It was 7:00 pm on a Tuesday, which meant most of the high rollers had retreated to their lavish suites after a day spent gambling, leaving the space feeling both opulent and eerily quiet.  

Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, her name as long and elegant as the silk scarf draped around her neck, surveyed the scene from behind the ornate concierge desk. Her posture was impeccable, her smile practiced yet genuine. Eleanor had perfected the art of appearing composed amidst the chaotic ballet of wealth and desire that played out within these walls every day. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine, a premonition that something was about to shift, disrupt the carefully orchestrated order of the Bellagio. It wasn't just the lingering scent of jasmine that seemed to permeate the air, heavier than usual, almostâ€¦unsettling. 


A sharp rap on the polished marble echoed through the lobby. Eleanor turned towards the sound, her gaze settling on a figure emerging from the grand staircase. He was tall and broad-shouldered, his face obscured by the shadows of a fedora pulled low over his brow.  

This wasn't your typical high roller. This man held an aura of mystery, a darkness that seemed to seep into the very air around him. 


Eleanor straightened her spine, her smile faltering for just a moment before returning with renewed vigor. "Good evening," she said, her voice clear and controlled.  "May I be of service?"
