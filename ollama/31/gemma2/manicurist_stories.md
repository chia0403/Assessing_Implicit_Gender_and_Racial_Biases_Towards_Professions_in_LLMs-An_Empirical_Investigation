The fluorescent lights hummed above Esme Evangeline Beaumont's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of pastel-painted nail polish bottles lining the wall. Outside, the relentless July sun beat down on the bustling sidewalk outside "Essie's Nails," but inside, the air conditioner battled valiantly, sending puffs of cold air across the plush velvet chairs and chrome manicure tables. 

Esme, a woman whose name was as dramatic as her talent, sat meticulously applying a single coat of shimmering silver polish to Mrs. Henderson's nails. The older woman, a fixture in Essie's Nails for nearly twenty years, let out a satisfied sigh. "It makes my hands look so much younger," she murmured, peering at the tip of her index finger with approval.

Esme smiled, her dark eyes twinkling. "You always look beautiful, Mrs. Henderson." 

The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new customer. Esme glanced up, curiosity piqued by the figure that stepped into the cool haven of her shop. He was tall and angular, with hair the color of storm clouds and eyes that seemed to hold a thousand untold stories. He looked utterly out of place amidst the pastel pinks and sunny yellows, like a wolf stepping into a flock of sheep.  Esme found herself wondering what secrets lay beneath his brooding exterior â€“ and what kind of nail polish he might choose.
