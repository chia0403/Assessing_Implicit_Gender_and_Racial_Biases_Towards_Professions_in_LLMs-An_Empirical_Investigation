The air hung heavy with the scent of hay and manure, a familiar perfume to Elara Juniper Finch. She inhaled deeply, enjoying the earthy aroma that seemed to permeate every fiber of the sprawling barn behind Maplewood Manor. Sunlight slanted through gaps in the weathered wood, painting stripes across the dusty floor where a kaleidoscope of chickens strutted and clucked amongst scattered feed sacks.  Elara, her worn boots thudding softly against the wooden planks, ran a hand along the rough, splintered surface of a stall door. Inside, a sleepy piglet snorted, its pink snout twitching as it dreamt of mud puddles and overflowing troughs. 


This was Elara's sanctuary, a world away from the hushed halls and polished surfaces of Maplewood Manor itself, where she worked as caretaker to a handful of eccentric humans.  She loved them all in her own way â€“ Mrs. Hathaway with her endless stream of knitting projects, Mr. Peabody who spoke mostly in riddles, and young Emily, whose laughter echoed through the house like wind chimes. But here, amongst the bleating sheep, squawking geese, and sleepy cows, she truly felt at peace.
