The stench of ozone and burning rubber hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the shrill wail of sirens converging on the scene. Rain slicked the asphalt, reflecting the flashing red and blue lights like scattered jewels. Beneath a sputtering streetlamp, Amelia "Amy" Hayes knelt beside a crumpled heap of metal, her gloved hands working with practiced efficiency as she checked for vital signs. The driver, a young woman barely out of her teens, was unconscious, blood blossoming on the white fabric of her shirt. 

Amy, a seasoned EMT with City Rescue, took stock of the situation. A mangled bicycle lay next to the car, its twisted handlebars a grim testament to the force of the impact. The intersection was chaos: pedestrians huddled behind barriers, their faces pale and drawn, while police officers began directing traffic. Despite the pandemonium, Amy maintained her calm focus, her mind a blur of assessments and action plans. This wasn't just another call; it felt heavier, more urgent. 


Her gaze drifted to the young woman in front of her, the rising bloodstain on her chest mirroring the pulsing red lights above.  Time was critical. Amy knew she had to act fast, every second counting. The rain intensified, a cold drizzle soaking through her uniform, but she barely noticed. There was no room for fear or hesitation; only the sharp, unwavering purpose of saving a life.
