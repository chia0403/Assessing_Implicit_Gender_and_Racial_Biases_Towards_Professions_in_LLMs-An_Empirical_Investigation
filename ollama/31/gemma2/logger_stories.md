The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Elias Thornewood. A sunrise bled through the canopy, painting long shadows across the forest floor where he stood, axe resting comfortably against his shoulder. Dewdrops clung to the bark of the ancient redwood giants, their towering forms whispering secrets in the morning breeze. 

Elias, weathered and calloused from years spent wrestling with the wilderness, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. Today's work was a familiar dance - felling these majestic trees, their timber destined for mills that would churn out homes and furniture, fueling the insatiable hunger of the world beyond the woods.  He felt a pang of regret, a fleeting echo of something he couldn't quite name, before it was swallowed by the rhythmic thumping of his heart. His work was hard, dangerous, but it was honest. It was all he knew.
