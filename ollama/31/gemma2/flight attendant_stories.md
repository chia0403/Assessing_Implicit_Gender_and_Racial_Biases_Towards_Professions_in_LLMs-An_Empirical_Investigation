The stale scent of recycled air hung heavy in the cramped aisle as Eloise Genevieve Beaumont meticulously straightened a row of seatback pockets. The flickering blue light from the overhead panel cast her reflection on the window opposite, highlighting the faint lines around her tired eyes. 

She was stationed at Gate 47B, a purgatory for weary travelers and bored flight attendants alike, watching the passengers trickle onto Flight 237 to Seattle. This particular route was Eloise's least favorite. It wasn't the passengers – she'd learned long ago to navigate their moods with practiced ease – but the endless monotony of the journey itself. The grey expanse of cloud cover outside, mirroring the dull ache in her heart, only served to amplify the feeling of being stuck in a loop. 


This flight, though, felt different. There was an electric tension in the air, a hum beneath the usual murmur of pre-flight chatter. Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to happen.
