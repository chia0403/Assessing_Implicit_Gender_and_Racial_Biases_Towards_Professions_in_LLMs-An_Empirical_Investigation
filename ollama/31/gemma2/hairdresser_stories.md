The air hung thick with the scent of coconut shampoo and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows of "Shear Perfection," blurring the neon sign that promised, with a touch of irony, "A Cut Above."  

Inside, Elara Nightingale perched on a stool, snipping away at a stubborn tangle in the back of Mrs. Henderson's hair. Elara knew every inch of this salon – from the faded floral wallpaper to the chipped porcelain sink – and every client who graced its worn red vinyl chairs. Mrs. Henderson, with her perpetual frown and penchant for beige cardigans, was a Tuesday regular, always complaining about her greying roots and the price of milk these days. 

Elara loved her job, even on days like this, when the storm threatened to drown out the rhythmic hum of the hairdryers and the chatter of gossip that usually filled the space. There was something comforting about the quiet predictability of it all – a small haven of routine in a world that seemed determined to spin out of control. But today, a different kind of tension crackled through the air, a prickle on the back of Elara’s neck that had nothing to do with Mrs. Henderson's increasingly elaborate complaints about her pension. 


Today, something was different.
