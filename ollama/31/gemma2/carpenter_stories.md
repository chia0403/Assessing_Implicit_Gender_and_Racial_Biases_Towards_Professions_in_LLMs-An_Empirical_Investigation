The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and varnish in Elias Thorne’s workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes that danced in the still air. Outside, the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven hummed with the usual morning bustle – seagulls crying, fishermen mending nets, children's laughter echoing from the harborfront. But inside Elias' workshop, time seemed to move differently. 

Elias, a man weathered by years spent wrestling with wood and wind, ran his calloused hand over the smooth surface of an unfinished rocking chair. It was for Mrs. Hawthorne, her arthritis making it difficult to climb her old, creaky steps. He knew every curve of that chair, imagined the worn grandmother’s hands gently cradling its arms, a warm cup of tea in her lap as she watched the sun set over the ocean. His work wasn't just about building things; it was about weaving stories into each piece, breathing life and comfort into wood. He smiled, feeling the familiar warmth that came with creating something beautiful and useful. 


But today, a strange restlessness gnawed at him. A storm was brewing both outside and within.
