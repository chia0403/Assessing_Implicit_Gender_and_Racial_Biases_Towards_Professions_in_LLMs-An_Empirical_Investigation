This stark space, filled with the whirring of machinery and hushed whispers, was where she felt most alive, her hands a conduit for healing amidst the chaos of life and death.

Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his heartbeat as Eleanor battled to stitch together his fractured innards.  This wasn't just another surgery; it was a dance between skill, instinct, and desperation, with Eleanor's every movement holding the weight of Mr. Henderson's future in her hands.
