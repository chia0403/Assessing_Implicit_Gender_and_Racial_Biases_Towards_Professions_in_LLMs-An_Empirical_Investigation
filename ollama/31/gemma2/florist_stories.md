The bell above the shop door tinkled softly as Eleanor Thistlewick straightened the drooping lilies in the vase on display. Sunlight streamed through the dusty panes, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across her cramped flower shop, "Flourish."  

It was Tuesday afternoon, a notoriously slow time for business. The air hung heavy with the scent of fresh roses and hyacinths, mingled with the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea from Eleanor's chipped china mug perched precariously on the counter. Outside, sparrows chirped in the branches of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel across the cobblestone street, its gnarled branches reaching out like arthritic fingers.  

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. Tuesday afternoons were usually for tending to her overflowing inventory, researching new varieties of blooms, and indulging in the quiet solitude of her shop. But today, a nagging unease gnawed at her. The feeling was subtle, like a misplaced petal amidst the vibrant chaos of her floral haven.  


Eleanor glanced at the clock on the wall, its hands pointing to three-thirty. It was time for Mrs. Hawthorne's weekly delivery. She hoped the old woman wasn't unwell. Her visits were always a welcome respite from the loneliness that sometimes crept into Eleanorâ€™s life.
