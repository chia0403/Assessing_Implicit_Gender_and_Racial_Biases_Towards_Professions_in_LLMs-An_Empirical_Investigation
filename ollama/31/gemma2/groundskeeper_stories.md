The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick's overalls like a second skin as he surveyed his domain. The sprawling estate, Oakhaven Manor, was nestled in the valley, its ancient oaks casting long shadows across the dew-laden grass. Their gnarled branches, twisted by centuries of wind and weather, resembled arthritic fingers reaching towards the pale sky. Bartholomew, his weathered face etched with a lifetime of tending these grounds, could almost hear them whispering their secrets to him. He took a deep breath, inhaling the earthy scent of damp soil and decaying leaves, a familiar aroma that held the promise of a new day's work.  

Oakhaven Manor was more than just a place; it was Bartholomew's lifeblood. He knew every inch of the meticulously manicured gardens, every hidden pathway winding through the dense woodland, every whispering bird and scurrying squirrel. 


He ran his calloused hand along the smooth surface of a marble fountain, its bronze nymphs frozen mid-cascade. The water trickled softly, a melancholic melody echoing through the still morning air. Bartholomew felt a pang of loneliness as he listened, a feeling that often crept over him in the quiet solitude of Oakhaven.  He was alone here, save for the ever-present whisper of the wind and the rustling of leaves.
