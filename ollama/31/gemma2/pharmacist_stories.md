The air in "Pharma Plus" hung thick with the scent of menthol and desperation.  Agnes Periwinkle meticulously counted out yellow pills into plastic containers, her brow furrowed in concentration. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the linoleum floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. 

Agnes wasn't a woman who dealt well with shadows, both literally and figuratively. They reminded her of things lurking just beyond her understanding, things she preferred to avoid.  Her world was one of precise measurements, labelled bottles, and carefully followed prescriptions. It was a safe world, predictable and comforting in its order. 

The bell above the door chimed, shattering the quiet predictability of Agnes' afternoon. A man entered, his face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat. He looked around nervously, as if unsure whether he belonged there at all. This wasn't unusual; many people came to Pharma Plus feeling lost or desperate. But this man had an air of urgency about him, a tremor in his hand that betrayed his carefully constructed composure. 


This was Agnes Periwinkle's world - a place where prescriptions were dispensed and anxieties simmered, waiting for someone like her to help them find some semblance of order.
