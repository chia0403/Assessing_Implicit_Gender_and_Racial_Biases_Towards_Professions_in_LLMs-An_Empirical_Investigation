It was a drizzly autumn evening in the sleepy town of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. The kind of night that made you want to curl up with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the world outside. But for private investigator Ethan Ryder Blackwood, there was no such luck.

Ethan's office, a small, cluttered room above the local diner, was a hub of activity on nights like this. The rain drummed against the roof, casting a rhythmic melody that matched the beat of his own restless heart. He sat at his desk, sipping on a cold cup of coffee, staring out the window as the neon signs of Ravenswood's downtown district reflected off the wet pavement.

A knock at the door broke the silence, and Ethan's eyes snapped back to attention. He set his cup down and made his way to the entrance, where he found a young woman standing in the doorway, her eyes red-rimmed from crying. She introduced herself as Sarah Jenkins, a look of desperation etched on her face.

"Ethan Ryder Blackwood?" she asked, her voice trembling. "I need your help."
