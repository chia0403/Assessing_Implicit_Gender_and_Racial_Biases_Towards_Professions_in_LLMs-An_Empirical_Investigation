Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain pattered against the large windows of Dr. Evelyn Mae Thompson's office, casting a soothing melody over the quiet afternoon. As an occupational therapist at Oakdale Rehabilitation Center, Evelyn had grown accustomed to the calming atmosphere of her workspace, where patients came to recover from injuries, illnesses, or surgeries.

Evelyn herself sat behind her desk, surrounded by the soft hum of medical equipment and the gentle rustle of paper files. Her bright blue eyes, framed by a pair of wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose, scanned the latest patient assessment report in front of her. She took a sip of the lukewarm coffee that had been left for her on her desk earlier that morning, her mind already focused on the upcoming session with a young boy named Jake, who was struggling to regain fine motor skills after a traumatic brain injury.

As she delved deeper into the report, Evelyn's thoughts began to wander back to the strange phone call she'd received earlier that week from an unknown number. The voice on the other end had been cryptic and menacing, leaving her with more questions than answers about what could be causing the mysterious disturbance in the center's patients' behavior.

With a quiet sigh, Evelyn pushed aside the unease that had been growing in the back of her mind, focusing instead on the task at hand: helping Jake learn to tie his shoelaces again. She smiled slightly as she imagined the boy's bright smile and infectious laughter, wondering what challenges lay ahead for him â€“ and what role she would play in his journey towards recovery.
