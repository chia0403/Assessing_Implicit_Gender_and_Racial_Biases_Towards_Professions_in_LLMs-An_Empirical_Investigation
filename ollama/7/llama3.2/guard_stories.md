Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven gleamed like polished onyx in the dim light of the evening, casting long shadows across the cobblestone sidewalks. It was a night much like any other, yet somehow felt different - as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

In a small, nondescript watchtower perched atop a hill overlooking the city, Guardsman Emilia "Mia" Thorne stood vigil, her eyes scanning the rooftops and alleyways below with a practiced intensity. She had been stationed here for five years now, watching over the citizens of New Haven from her elevated vantage point.

As she checked the watch's chronometer for what felt like the hundredth time that night, the radio crackled to life in her ear. "All units, this is dispatch. We have reports of a disturbance at the old clock tower on 5th and Main. Repeat, do not approach the scene without backup."

Mia's grip on her rifle tightened slightly as she listened to the dispatcher's voice. Something didn't feel right about this one. The clock tower had been abandoned for years, its once-grand facade now covered in ivy and peeling paint. But it was always a high-priority zone - and never, ever without a response from the Guard.

Without hesitation, Mia keyed her radio to respond: "This is Watchtower 7-Alpha. I'm on my way. What's the situation?"

As she spoke, she couldn't shake the feeling that this night might just be one she'd never forget.
