Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint Main Street and its handful of shops and restaurants. The smell of freshly cut wood and sawdust wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet scent of blooming lilacs that lined the sidewalks.

In his workshop just off the street, Jack Alexander "Alex" Thompson was bringing a piece of furniture to life. A skilled carpenter with calloused hands and a keen eye for detail, Alex had spent years honing his craft, working on everything from cozy family homes to grand public buildings. He took pride in every project he worked on, pouring his heart and soul into each one.

As the evening wore on and the workshop grew quieter, Alex stepped back to admire his latest creation: a beautiful wooden rocking chair with intricate carvings of leaves and vines etched into its frame. The chair seemed to glow with an inner light, as if the very essence of the forest had been distilled into this one piece.

Alex smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over him. It was moments like these that reminded him why he loved being a carpenter: the combination of creativity and practicality, the feel of working with his hands to create something beautiful and useful from raw materials.

But as he gazed at the chair, Alex's mind began to wander to the strange letter he'd received earlier that day. The envelope had arrived at the workshop just before lunch, addressed to him in elegant handwriting with no return address or indication of who might have sent it. Inside, a single sheet of paper had been folded into a neat square, containing only two cryptic words: "The Shadow Wood is awakening."
