As the last wisps of sunlight faded behind the rows of towering trees, Highway Maintenance Technician First Class Ethan Ryder gazed out at the stretch of asphalt before him. The worn highway, designated as US Route 12 East, snaked its way through the heart of rural Oklahoma, a seemingly endless ribbon of blacktop that connected small towns to larger cities.

Ethan's boots were scuffed and his jeans were stained with grease, a testament to a day's worth of work on the side of the road. His worn denim jacket was emblazoned with the insignia of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, a badge he wore with pride as he worked tirelessly behind the scenes to keep the state's highways safe.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the deserted stretch of road, Ethan's thoughts turned to the storm that was brewing on the horizon. Dark clouds were gathering, their anvil-shaped peaks reaching for the sky like giant fists. The air was heavy with electricity, and Ethan could feel the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end.

"Time to get to work," he muttered to himself, shouldering his toolbox and heading out into the stormy night ahead. Little did he know, this would be a night that would test his skills as a highway worker in ways he never could have imagined.
