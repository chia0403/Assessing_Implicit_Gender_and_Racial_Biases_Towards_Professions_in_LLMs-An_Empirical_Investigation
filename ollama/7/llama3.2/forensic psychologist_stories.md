Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a renowned forensic psychologist with a sharp mind and an even sharper instinct for human behavior, stood at the edge of the mist-shrouded lake, gazing out across the water. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar smell that always seemed to stir something deep within her. It was a smell that reminded her of childhood summers spent playing along these very shores, of lazy afternoons spent exploring the woods and dreaming of adventures.
