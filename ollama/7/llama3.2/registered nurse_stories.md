Here's a potential story opening:

The stormy night air clung to the small coastal town like a damp shroud, casting a gloomy pallor over the quaint streets and homes. In the hospital on the outskirts of town, Registered Nurse Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the nurse's station, sipping her lukewarm coffee as she watched the chaos unfold outside. The ER was a flurry of activity, with patients streaming in from the storm that had battered the coast for hours.

As Lexi's eyes scanned the sea of faces, one patient caught her attention - a young woman, no more than twenty-five years old, who lay motionless on the stretcher, her pale skin seeming to glow in the faint light of the hospital. The woman's name was Emily Wilson, and she had been brought in by her frantic boyfriend after the storm had torn through their small beachside cottage.

Lexi felt a pang of curiosity as she made her way over to Emily's bedside. She knew that this storm was no ordinary one - it had brought with it powerful winds and massive waves that had left destruction in its wake. But what secrets lay hidden beneath Emily's tranquil surface, waiting to be uncovered?
