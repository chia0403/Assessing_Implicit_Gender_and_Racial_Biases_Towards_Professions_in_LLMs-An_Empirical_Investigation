Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the city's underbelly reflected off the wet pavement outside, casting a gaudy glow over the cramped alleyways and rundown bars that lined the streets. Inside the Red Door, a small, unassuming bar nestled in the heart of the neighborhood, bartender Emilia "Mia" Rodriguez polished a glass with a white cloth, her eyes scanning the room for the next drink order.

It was a slow night, just the usual assortment of regulars and the occasional lost soul stumbling in off the street. The TV above the bar displayed a sports game that no one really watched, the sounds of the crowd muted by the constant hum of the refrigerators behind the counter.

Mia had worked at the Red Door for five years, ever since she'd left her job as a waitress to pursue her true passion: mixology. She knew every cocktail recipe, every beer pairing, and every trick for coaxing more money out of the bar's tight budget. But despite her expertise, Mia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off tonight.

As she reached for the bottle of bourbon on the top shelf, her hand brushed against a small, crumpled piece of paper tucked away in the corner of the counter. She picked it up, smoothing out the creases with a practiced motion, and unfolded it to reveal a cryptic message scrawled in red ink: "Meet me at midnight. Come alone."
