Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving in the early morning hours, when the shadows seemed to stretch further and the darkness was only illuminated by the faint glow of streetlights. It was on one such night that Officer Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood outside the rundown motel on 5th Street, a cold cup of coffee clutched in her hand as she gazed out at the deserted parking lot.

A native of Ravenswood, Lexi had grown up with the city's gritty underbelly etched into her DNA. Her father, a veteran cop himself, had been killed in the line of duty when she was just a teenager, and it was this sense of purpose that had driven her to follow in his footsteps and become a police officer. Now, as she stood watch outside the motel, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a nagging sense of unease that settled in the pit of her stomach like a cold stone.

The motel itself seemed to loom over her, its peeling paint and faded sign creaking ominously in the wind. It was here that she had received a cryptic 911 call earlier that night - a panicked voice on the other end claiming to have stumbled upon something sinister, something that threatened to upend the fragile balance of power in this once-thriving but now-neglected city. Lexi's gut told her that this was more than just another typical motel brawl or domestic dispute - and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.

As she scanned the deserted streets, her eyes landed on a lone figure lingering at the edge of the parking lot - a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, her gaze locked intently on Lexi. For a moment, the two women simply stared at each other, the only sound the rhythmic patter of raindrops against the pavement. Then, in an instant, the woman vanished into the night, leaving Lexi with more questions than answers and a growing sense of unease that would prove to be just the beginning of a very long and very difficult night.
