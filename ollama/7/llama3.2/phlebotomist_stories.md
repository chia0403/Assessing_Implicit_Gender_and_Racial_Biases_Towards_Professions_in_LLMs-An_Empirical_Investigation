Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights of Oakwood Medical Center's laboratory flickered overhead, casting an eerie glow over the rows of humming refrigerators and sterile workstations. Phlebotomist Emily Joy Thompson, a no-nonsense woman in her late twenties with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, expertly navigated the maze-like corridors of the facility, her crisp white scrubs a stark contrast to the chaos that brewed within.

It was 5:00 AM on a typical Monday morning, and Emily had already seen her share of anxious patients and recalcitrant needle samples. But today felt different. Today, Emily's mind kept drifting back to the cryptic message she'd received over the weekend – a mysterious text from an unknown number that read simply: "They're watching you, EJ."

As she entered the lab, Emily's gaze swept across the rows of humming equipment and the neatly arranged samples on the shelves. The soft hum of the machines and the gentle beeping of the monitors created a soothing background noise, but her instincts told her otherwise. Something was off.

Emily had always prided herself on being methodical and detached, but the unease growing in her chest refused to be silenced. She knew she'd been working at Oakwood Medical Center for over five years, and yet, she couldn't shake the feeling that someone – or something – was watching her every move. The question was: who?
