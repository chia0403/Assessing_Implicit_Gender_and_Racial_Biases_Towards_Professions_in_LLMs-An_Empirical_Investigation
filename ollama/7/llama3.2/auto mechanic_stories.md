Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Redemption, Arizona, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty Main Street. The smell of grease and gasoline wafted through the air from the local garage, where 32-year-old Jesse Ryder "Rye" Jackson spent most of his days tinkering with engines and fixing broken dreams.

Rye, a ruggedly handsome man with a thick beard and a mop of messy brown hair, wiped the sweat from his forehead as he watched a sleek black Mustang pull into the garage. The car's owner, a young woman with piercing green eyes and jet-black hair, slipped out of the driver's seat and approached Rye with a look of desperation etched on her face.

"I need you to fix my engine," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "It just won't start."

Rye raised an eyebrow, intrigued by the mysterious woman's plight. He gestured for her to follow him into the garage, where the smell of motor oil and worn leather filled the air. As they walked in, Rye couldn't help but notice the look of unease on her face, like she was hiding something - or running from someone.

"Let's take a look," he said, his eyes scanning the engine for any signs of trouble. Little did he know, this chance encounter would set off a chain reaction that would change Rye's life forever.
