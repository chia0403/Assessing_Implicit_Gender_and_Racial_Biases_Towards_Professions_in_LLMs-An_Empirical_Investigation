Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Ava Elizabeth Thompson stood at the edge of the rooftop, gazing out over the sprawling city below as the first hints of dawn crept over the concrete canyons. The wind whipped through her dark brown hair, carrying with it the whispers of the night before - whispers that only she could hear. As a clinical psychologist with a specialty in trauma and PTSD, Ava had spent countless hours listening to the stories of those who had been broken by their experiences. But tonight, she stood alone, the weight of her own secrets pressing down upon her like the city's towering skyscrapers.

The rooftop of the university's psychology building was her sanctuary, a place where she could escape the prying eyes and probing questions of her colleagues. It was here that Ava came to process the fragments of her own shattered past, and to prepare for the long day ahead - one that would take her into the darkest recesses of the human mind, in search of answers that she herself still struggled to find.

As she breathed in the crisp morning air, Ava felt a sense of restlessness stir within her. It was a feeling she knew all too well, a reminder that even with the best training and expertise, some wounds ran too deep for anyone - including herself - to fully heal.
