As he polished the brass door handles with a white glove, his piercing blue eyes scanned the gathering throng, searching for any sign of trouble or excitement.

The door swung open, admitting a gust of cold air and a tall, imposing figure in a tailored black coat. "Monsieur Dupont?" the stranger asked, his voice low and gravelly.

Étienne's instincts prickled as he rose from his chair, his eyes locked on the newcomer. "Can I help you?"
