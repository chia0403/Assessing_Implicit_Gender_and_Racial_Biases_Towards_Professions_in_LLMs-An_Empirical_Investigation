Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the city like a relentless curtain, casting a misty veil over the steel and concrete canyons that seemed to stretch on forever. Architect Emilia Rose Thistlewaite stood at the edge of her desk, gazing out the window of her office high above the bustling streets of New York City. Her eyes, a deep shade of indigo that seemed almost purple in the dim light of the office, narrowed as she stared out at the city's skeletal frame.

As she watched, a taxi screeched to a halt outside the building, sending a splash of rainwater onto the sidewalk below. The driver, a gruff-looking man with a thick beard and a New York accent that was as familiar as it was abrasive, stood up and lit a cigarette before turning to shout at his passenger - Emilia's brother, James.

"Hey, kiddo! Come on outta there before you get soaked!" he bellowed, as if Emilia needed reminding. She raised an eyebrow, her expression unreadable behind the wire-rimmed glasses that perched on the end of her nose. It was a gesture she'd perfected over years of dealing with her brother's blustery entrances and exits.

Emilia's office was a cramped but comfortable space, lined with drafting tables and shelves stocked with stacks of books and papers. The walls were adorned with her own designs - sleek, modern buildings that seemed to defy gravity and push the boundaries of what was possible in urban design. It was a place where Emilia could escape the chaos of the world outside, if only for a few hours at a time.

But as she turned back to her desk, her eyes lingering on the plans spread out before her, Emilia's thoughts turned to more pressing concerns. Her latest project - a high-rise development in downtown Manhattan that promised to be one of the most ambitious and complex of her career - was starting to show signs of trouble. And Emilia had a feeling that things were about to get a lot worse before they got better.
