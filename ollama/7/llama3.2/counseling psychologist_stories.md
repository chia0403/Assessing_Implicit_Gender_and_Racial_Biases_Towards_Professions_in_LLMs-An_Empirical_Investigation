Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment and onto the crisp autumn morning air, gazing out at the bustling streets of downtown Seattle. The gray mist that clung to the city's rooftops seemed to match the somber mood that had been following her for weeks. As a counseling psychologist with a specialty in trauma recovery, Lexi was no stranger to darkness. But lately, she'd been struggling to find her footing.

Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill her lungs as she made her way down the stairs and out into the morning rush. Her eyes scanned the crowded sidewalk, taking in the sounds of car horns and chatter, the wail of sirens echoing from the distance. She shivered, despite the warmth of her coffee-scented scarf.

Just a few blocks away, the gleaming glass towers of the city's financial district pierced the sky like shards of steel. Lexi had once been drawn to this world, with its promises of prestige and power. But after years of helping high-achievers navigate their own personal demons, she'd come to realize that the pursuit of success wasn't worth sacrificing her own well-being.

As she walked, Lexi's mind wandered to the new client waiting for her at the clinic â€“ a young woman named Sarah, who had fled a troubled past in rural Oregon. Lexi had promised herself that she'd provide a safe haven for Sarah, just as she needed one for herself.

And so, with a newfound sense of determination, Lexi began her walk to the clinic, the gray Seattle morning stretching out before her like an uncertain canvas waiting to be filled.
