The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Butcher's shop was thick with the scent of iron and rosemary. Not an unpleasant smell, mind you, but one that clung to your clothes long after you left. The bell above the door jingled merrily as Mrs. Higgins entered, her usual Saturday request for lamb chops already forming on her lips. Bart, a burly man with hands calloused from years of cleaving and slicing, smiled his familiar crooked grin.

"Morning, Mrs. Higgins," he boomed, his voice echoing through the small shop.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating rows of crimson sausages hanging from hooks and gleaming mounds of freshly ground beef displayed on marble slabs. Behind him, a hulking side of beef lay draped over a butcher block, its marbled flesh waiting to be transformed into juicy steaks and tender roasts. The rhythmic thump-thump of Bart's cleaver against the bone was the heartbeat of his world, a world steeped in tradition and the primal satisfaction of feeding others.

But today, something felt different. An unsettling quiet had settled over the usually bustling street outside, punctuated only by the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer. Even Mrs. Higgins seemed subdued, her usual chatter replaced with hesitant glances toward the window. Bart couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, a shadow lurking at the edges of his familiar world.
