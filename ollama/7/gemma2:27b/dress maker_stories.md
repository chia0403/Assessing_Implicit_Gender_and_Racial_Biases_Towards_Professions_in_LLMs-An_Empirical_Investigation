The scent of lavender hung heavy in the air, battling with the sharper tang of beeswax and the faint, sweet aroma of cinnamon from Amelia Beatrice Blackwood's latest creation. Sunlight streamed through the arched window of her atelier, illuminating dust motes dancing above bolts of silk, velvet, and lace.  Amelia, a woman of perpetually ink-stained fingers and a braid so thick it could rival a rope, paused in her work, needle hovering mid-air. Outside, the cobbled streets of London bustled with carriages and hawkers' cries, but within these four walls, time seemed to slow, measured by the rhythmic clatter of Amelia's thimble against fabric. Today, however, a different rhythm pulsed beneath the surface: anticipation. For Lady Cavendish, the Duchess of Ashwood, was due to arrive any moment for her final fitting. 


This gown, a swirling confection of emerald silk embroidered with silver leaves and dewdrop pearls, was not just another commission. It held Amelia's hopes and dreams, stitched into every seam and pleat. A successful fitting could mean an introduction to the Duchessâ€™s circle, catapulting Amelia from a humble dressmaker in Bloomsbury to the esteemed ateliers of Mayfair.
