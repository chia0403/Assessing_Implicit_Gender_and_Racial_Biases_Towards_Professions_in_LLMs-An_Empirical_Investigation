The humid air hung heavy in Savannah, Georgia, thick with the scent of magnolia and salt from the nearby ocean.  Sweat beaded on Elias Jasper Blackwood's brow as he wrestled a stubborn azalea bush into its new bed. He loved this time of year, when the city exploded in a riot of color â€“ vibrant bougainvillea spilling over wrought-iron balconies, hibiscus blooming like flamboyant fireworks, and crepe myrtles draped in delicate pink blossoms. But today, the oppressive heat sapped his usual enthusiasm.

Elias surveyed his work with a critical eye. The azalea needed just a bit more soil around its roots, and then he'd move on to the hydrangeas waiting patiently by the porch. He wasn't just a landscaper; Elias was an artist, sculpting beauty out of nature's raw materials. His clients called him "The Green Whisperer," praising his uncanny ability to coax life from even the most neglected garden.
