The air in "Nails by Natalia" hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly on the strip mall parking lot, baking the asphalt until it shimmered. Inside, however, Natalia Rodriguez reigned supreme over her domain. She moved with a practiced grace, expertly shaping acrylics into elegant ovals, her nimble fingers wielding files and brushes like extensions of herself.

Natalia wasn't just any manicurist. Her clientele ranged from stressed-out housewives to high-powered executives, all drawn by her uncanny ability to transform tired hands into works of art. But today, a different energy pulsed in the salon. Natalia felt it in the prickling of her skin, the heightened awareness that came with a storm brewing on the horizon.

The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival. Natalia glanced up, her breath catching in her throat. It was him. The man from her dreams â€“ or perhaps, nightmares.  He stood awkwardly by the entrance, his eyes scanning the room before settling on her. His name was Mateo Garcia, and he was about to change everything.
