Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the barn, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Elara Finch's mounting anxiety. The wind howled like a tormented beast, threatening to rip the ancient oak tree at the edge of the field from its roots. Inside, amidst the comforting smells of hay and animal musk, Elara moved from stall to stall, checking on her charges. There was Bartholomew, the aging goat with a penchant for head-butting anything that moved; Esmeralda, the skittish mare whose foal had just been born; and a dozen other creatures entrusted to her care â€“ abandoned, injured, or simply unwanted. 

Tonight, however, Elara's worry wasn't confined to the usual storm anxieties. A strange silence had descended on the normally bustling animal sanctuary, broken only by the rhythmic drip of rainwater from the leaky roof.  Even Bartholomew seemed unusually quiet, his large brown eyes fixed on something beyond Elara's sight. Something was wrong. Very wrong.
