Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the precinct, mimicking the relentless hammering in Detective Isabella "Izzy" Vargas's chest. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the cluttered desk piled high with case files. Outside, sirens wailed a mournful symphony, echoing the despair that had settled over Izzy like a shroud.

The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. It was 3:00 am, and Izzy was knee-deep in the labyrinthine puzzle that was the "Moonlight Murderer" case. Three victims in as many months, each found beneath the sickly yellow glow of a streetlight, their faces contorted in silent screams, a single white rose clutched in their lifeless hands. The only clue: a cryptic playing card tucked into their pocket â€“ the Queen of Hearts.
