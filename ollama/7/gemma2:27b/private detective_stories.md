The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elias "Eli" Blackwood's office like a thousand tiny fists. Each drop echoed through the cramped space, bouncing off the chipped Formica tabletop and plaster walls plastered with faded wanted posters and dog-eared newspaper clippings. Eli himself was hunched over a lukewarm cup of coffee, its bitter aroma barely cutting through the dampness that permeated everything. 

The clock on the wall, perpetually five minutes slow, ticked away the dreary afternoon. Outside, the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" bar across the street flickered erratically, casting an unsettling crimson hue onto the slick asphalt. A stray cat yowled miserably from somewhere in the alleyway behind Eli's office building â€“ a symphony of urban misery playing out in the twilight.

Eli was about to give up on the day altogether when a sharp knock rattled the doorframe. He straightened in his chair, pushing the fedora further down his brow and bracing himself for whatever walked through that door next.
