The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an unsettling green pallor over the interrogation room. Dr. Elara Vance, her silver-streaked auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, studied the man across from her through narrowed eyes. He was young, barely out of his teens, with haunted blue eyes and a tremor running through his slender frame. His name was Thomas Blackwood, and he was accused of arson - setting fire to an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town.

The stench of burnt wood and chemicals still lingered in Elara's nostrils, even though she hadn't been near the crime scene for hours. The intensity of the flames, as described by firefighters, mirrored the turbulence raging within Thomas. He sat hunched over, picking at a nonexistent scab on his knee, avoiding her gaze.

"Thomas," Elara began softly, her voice carrying the gentle lilt of her Irish upbringing, "tell me again what happened that night."
