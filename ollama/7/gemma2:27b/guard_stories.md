The iron gate groaned like an old man complaining about the weather as Alistair Grimstone heaved it open, the chill wind whipping his threadbare cloak around him. The sun hung low in the bruised purple sky, casting long shadows across the cobblestone courtyard of Blackhaven Citadel.  Grimstone squinted at the approaching figure, a hooded silhouette swallowed by the dusk. He gripped the hilt of his rusty sword, its pommel cold against his calloused palm.

Blackhaven Citadel was a grim monument to a forgotten age, its imposing walls scarred by countless battles and its towers perpetually shrouded in mist. It stood on the precipice overlooking a tempestuous sea, the crashing waves a constant reminder of the unforgiving world beyond its stone embrace.

Grimstone's face, weathered and etched with lines like a map of hardship, held a stoic expression as he awaited the arrival of whoever dared to approach the Citadel after nightfall. His duty was clear: protect the secrets within these ancient walls, no matter the cost.
