Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, the sound like a thousand tiny fingers drumming impatiently. Beatrice “Bea” Ainsworth hunched over her ledgers, the flickering gas lamp casting long shadows across the dusty floorboards. The air hung heavy with the scent of mothballs and aging paper, punctuated by the occasional squeak of the rafters as the wind buffeted the old Victorian house.  

Bea, a woman of meticulous habits and sharp mind, frowned at a discrepancy in the accounts for the Blackwood Shipping Company. Her brow furrowed deeper as she double-checked her figures, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her quill against the ledger the only sound besides the insistent rain. 

Something wasn't right. A sum, substantial enough to raise eyebrows, was unaccounted for.  Bea sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its bun. She needed a fresh perspective. Perhaps a cup of tea and a stroll through the rambling garden would clear her head. But as she rose, a floorboard creaked ominously beneath her feet, followed by a muffled thud from the shadowy corner of the attic.

Bea froze, her heart hammering against her ribs. It couldn't be...could it?
