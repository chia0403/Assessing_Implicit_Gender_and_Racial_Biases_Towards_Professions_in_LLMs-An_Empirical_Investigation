Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Chen's Dental Care, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray. Eloise Cavendish sighed, her reflection staring back at her from the polished stainless steel instrument tray. Her blonde braid was beginning to unravel, stray strands clinging damply to her cheeks.  Another dreary Tuesday morning in Millersville, Ohio – population 12,487 and dwindling.

Eloise loved her job, truly she did. There was a quiet satisfaction in polishing away plaque, leaving teeth gleaming like polished pearls. But lately, the monotony had begun to gnaw at her. She longed for something more, an escape from the endless parade of cavities and gingivitis. Perhaps a trip to somewhere sun-drenched, where the air didn't smell perpetually of disinfectant and fear. 

Just then, the door creaked open, interrupting her musings. A tall figure, cloaked in shadow, stepped into the waiting room. Eloise couldn't make out any features behind the wide-brimmed hat pulled low over his face. Something about him sent a shiver down her spine – a sense of unease she couldn't quite place.
