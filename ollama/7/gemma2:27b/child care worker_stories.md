Rain lashed against the windows of Sunshine Daycare, blurring the cheerful yellow paint into an indistinguishable smear. Inside, Amelia Roseweather, her blonde braid whipping around her shoulders as she moved, tried in vain to herd a group of three-year-olds towards story time.  The air was thick with the scent of crayons and wet socks. A plastic teacup clattered to the floor, followed by shrieks of "Mine!" and "No fair!". Amelia sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. This day had started with a leaky roof and only gone downhill from there.


As she wrestled Timmy away from Emily's coveted purple crayon, a flash of lightning illuminated the room, plunging them momentarily into darkness. The children shrieked in delight, their fear forgotten. Amelia couldnâ€™t help but smile. Even on days like this, filled with chaos and spilled juice boxes, there was something undeniably magical about caring for these tiny humans.

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as the storm raged outside. It wasn't just the weather. There was a strange energy in the air, a tension that tightened like a drumskin. Amelia glanced at the clock: 3:15 pm. Only fifteen minutes until pick-up time. She hoped this day would end quickly and peacefully, but deep down, she couldn't shake the feeling that something unusual was about to happen.
