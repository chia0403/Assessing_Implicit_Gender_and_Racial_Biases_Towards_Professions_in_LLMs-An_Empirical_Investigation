Rain lashed against the frosted glass windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth’s dental office, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves outside into an impressionistic watercolor. Inside, the sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of mint toothpaste.  Eleanor sighed, tapping a manicured fingernail against her clipboard. It was a slow Tuesday afternoon, the kind where time seemed to stretch and yawn like a patient waiting for their anesthetic to wear off.

She glanced at the clock: 2:47 pm. Only three more appointments before she could finally escape this dreary office and curl up with a good book and a steaming cup of chamomile tea. A sudden insistent rapping on the door startled her from her reverie.  Eleanor smoothed down her crisp white coat, plastering on a professional smile. “Come in,” she called out, her voice laced with practiced cheer.


The door creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in darkness. Eleanor squinted, trying to make out the visitor’s features in the dimly lit hallway.
