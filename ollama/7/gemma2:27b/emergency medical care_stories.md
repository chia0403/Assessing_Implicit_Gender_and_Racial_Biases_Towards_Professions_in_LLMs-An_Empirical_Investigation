The wail of sirens pierced through Emilia Rossi's focus, pulling her back from the sterile calm she'd been cultivating while meticulously prepping an IV line. Her pulse quickened, adrenaline already surging in anticipation.  It was a familiar symphony – the frantic rhythm of the ambulance engine mingling with the urgent blaring of the siren – and it always hit her like a jolt of electricity. 

Emilia, a seasoned EMT with five years under her belt at Station 17, thrived on the chaos. She loved the unpredictable nature of her work, the constant dance between life and death played out in the cramped confines of an ambulance. Tonight, though, felt different. The weight of the call hung heavier in the air – a multi-vehicle collision reported with multiple victims.

The station doors clanged open, revealing the flashing red and blue lights reflecting off the wet asphalt outside. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the street scene into a watercolour mess. Emilia grabbed her bag, its contents familiarly comforting: stethoscope, bandages, defibrillator paddles, vials of adrenaline. Each item held the potential to save a life, or at least buy precious time. 


She met the eyes of her partner, Liam O'Connell, a stoic giant with hands capable of both gentle reassurance and brute strength. A silent nod passed between them – a shared understanding forged in countless high-pressure situations.

"Ready, Em?" Liam asked, his voice barely audible over the cacophony. 

Emilia nodded, her heart pounding against her ribs. "Let's go."
