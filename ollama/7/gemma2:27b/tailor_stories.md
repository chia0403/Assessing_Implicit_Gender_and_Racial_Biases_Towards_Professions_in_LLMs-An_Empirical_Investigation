Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Alistair Finch's shop, the rhythmic drumming a counterpoint to the steady thrumming of his sewing machine. The air hung heavy with the scent of beeswax, lavender sachets, and the faintest whiff of pipe tobacco - a testament to Alistair's late-night sessions hunched over intricate designs. Outside, London was drowning in a November downpour, but inside Finch & Fabric, nestled on a cobblestone side street in Bloomsbury, warmth emanated from both the hearth fire and the tailor himself.

Alistair, a man whose age was as indeterminate as the origin of his fine linen thread, surveyed the half-finished velvet doublet with critical eyes. Every stitch had to be perfect, every seam precise. He was crafting a garment for Lord Cavendish, a notoriously picky aristocrat, and Alistair's reputation – built over decades of painstaking work and unparalleled craftsmanship – depended on it.
