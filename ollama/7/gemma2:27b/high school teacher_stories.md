Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor "Ellie" Davenport's classroom, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the stacks of ungraded essays piled precariously on her desk. Outside, the bell shrieked, signaling the end of another grueling day at Willow Creek High. Ellie rubbed her temples, fighting off a headache that threatened to rival the thunderclaps booming in the distance.  

Willow Creek was a sleepy town nestled in the Appalachian foothills, where gossip traveled faster than the internet and everyone knew everyone else's business. Ellie had come here hoping for a fresh start, a chance to escape the shadows of her past. But the suffocating familiarity of small-town life was starting to wear on her.  

Her classroom, once a haven filled with the vibrant energy of teenage curiosity, now felt like a cage. The faded posters on the walls – Shakespeare quotes and images of historical figures – seemed to mock her with their outdated optimism. She glanced at the clock, its hands ticking relentlessly towards 4:00 pm. In an hour, she would have to face the parents' night meeting, a prospect that filled her with dread.
