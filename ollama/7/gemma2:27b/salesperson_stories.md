Rain lashed against the windows of Harold Finch's cramped office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest. Outside, the neon lights of Times Square blurred through the deluge, reflecting off the puddles that threatened to swallow the sidewalk whole. Harold, a man whose smile lines were more pronounced than his laugh lines, stared at the stack of rejection letters on his desk, each one a paper dart aimed at his already bruised confidence. He was a salesman for "Tomorrow's Tomorrow," a company peddling futuristic gadgets that promised to revolutionize everyday life.

Problem was, nobody seemed to buy it. 


Let me know if you'd like me to continue the story! I can develop Harold's character further, introduce other characters, or explore the challenges he faces in selling these "futuristic" products.
