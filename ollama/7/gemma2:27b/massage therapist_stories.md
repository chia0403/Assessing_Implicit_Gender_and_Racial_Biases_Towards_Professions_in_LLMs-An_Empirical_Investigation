Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa, a rhythmic counterpoint to the gentle strains of Enya drifting from hidden speakers. Eloise Sinclair kneaded a knot in her client's shoulder, her fingers working with practiced ease. The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of ozone from the recent storm. 

Eloise loved this time of day â€“ late afternoon, when the rush had subsided and she could finally catch her breath. She glanced at the clock: 4:30 pm. Only one more client before she could head home, curl up on the couch with a good book, and forget about the world for a while.

But Eloise's tranquility was shattered by the insistent ringing of the doorbell, followed by a frantic rapping on the glass pane. She glanced at her client, Mr. Henderson, who was snoring softly under her touch. Sighing, she rose and went to investigate.
