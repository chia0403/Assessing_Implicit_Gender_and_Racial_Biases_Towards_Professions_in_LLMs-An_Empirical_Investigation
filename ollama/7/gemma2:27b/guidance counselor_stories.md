The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Hawthorne's head, casting an anemic glow over the stacks of college brochures littering her desk. The air in the cramped guidance office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage anxiety. Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied dances against the windows of Northwood High School. 

Ellie sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear. Her heart ached for these kids - seniors on the precipice of adulthood, their futures shimmering like mirages in the desert air.  Today was college application deadline day, and the usual frenetic energy that pulsed through the office had been replaced by a tense silence. 

A knock on the door startled Ellie from her reverie. She straightened her cardigan and plastered on her brightest smile. "Come in!" she chirped, hoping it wasn't another student with a last-minute panic attack.
