Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Microphone, blurring the neon "Open Mic" sign into a hazy smear of pink and green. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and desperation. Eloise Beaumont adjusted her battered acoustic guitar on her knee, her fingers tracing the worn frets nervously. Tonight was her last chance.

She'd poured her heart and soul into her music for years, playing dive bars and open mics across the city, dreaming of a break that never seemed to come. But tonight, a scout from a major record label was rumored to be in attendance. If Eloise could just impress him with her raw talent and powerful voice, everything could change.

Her stomach churned with anticipation and fear. Could she summon the courage to pour her soul onto the stage one more time? As the MC announced her name, Eloise took a deep breath and stepped into the spotlight, the weight of her dreams resting on her shoulders.
