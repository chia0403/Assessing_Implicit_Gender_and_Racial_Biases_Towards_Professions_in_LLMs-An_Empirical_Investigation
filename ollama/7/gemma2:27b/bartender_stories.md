Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Nail, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a swirling mess of red and blue. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of stale beer, punctuated by the rhythmic clinking of glasses and the low rumble of conversation.

Behind the mahogany bar, Alistair Finch meticulously polished a pint glass, his movements precise and economical. His reflection stared back at him â€“ tired eyes framed by dark circles, a neatly trimmed beard dusted with grey, and a wry smile playing on his lips. At fifty-three, Alistair had seen it all: heartache, joy, desperation, and everything in between. He'd listened to countless confessions whispered over the rim of a glass, dispensed advice freely, and offered solace in the form of a stiff drink and a sympathetic ear.

Tonight, however, The Rusty Nail felt different. A palpable tension hummed beneath the surface, a whisper of something out of place. Alistair couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he knew something was brewing. He just hoped it wouldn't spill over onto his bar.
