The midday sun beat down on the quarry, turning the white dust into shimmering heat haze. Elias Thorne wiped sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, squinting at the block of granite he was shaping. It wasn't the easiest piece to work with – full of stubborn veins and unpredictable fractures – but the final product, a fountain centerpiece for the Duke's new gardens, promised a hefty reward.

Elias loved this part of the process: coaxing the stone's hidden beauty into being. He saw shapes in every rough edge, imagined the delicate curves of petals blooming from the granite heart. The rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel filled the air, punctuated by the occasional grunt of exertion and the sharp crack as a sliver of stone broke away.

But today, a restlessness gnawed at Elias. Something wasn't right. It started with a strange dream the night before – visions of swirling mist and a voice whispering about "the heartstone." Then, there was the unsettling feeling that someone, or something, was watching him.

As he leaned in closer to examine his work, a faint tremor ran through the ground. The air grew still, the only sound now the pounding of Elias' own heart. He looked up, searching for the source of the disturbance, but saw nothing except the endless blue sky and the craggy cliffs that surrounded the quarry.

Something was coming. Elias could feel it in his bones.
