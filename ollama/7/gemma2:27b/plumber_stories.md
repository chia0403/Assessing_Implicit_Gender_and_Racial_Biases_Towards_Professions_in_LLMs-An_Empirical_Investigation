Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Harold "Harry" Finnegan's van, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the already dented metal. The gutters, overflowing with grimy water, added their own percussive chorus to the symphony of urban decay.  Harry sighed, his breath fogging the cracked windshield as he stared out at the neon-drenched streets of Lower Southwark.  Tonight was shaping up to be another classic London deluge, the kind that turned pavements into rivers and alleyways into murky streams.

He'd been called out to a leaky faucet in a dilapidated tenement building on The Cut. A simple job, supposedly. But Harry knew better than to trust appearances in this part of town. Every dripping pipe could hide a subterranean river of woes, every clogged drain a portal to the city's festering underbelly.  He grabbed his toolbox - battered brass and chipped enamel â€“ and stepped out into the torrent, praying that the leaky faucet wouldn't be the least of his problems tonight.
