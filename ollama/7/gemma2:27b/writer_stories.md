Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Elara Winthropâ€™s concentration. The manuscript lay open on her lap, the words blurring under the dampness seeping through the ancient glass.  Elara sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its braid. She loved this old house, with its crooked floors and creaking stairs, but it certainly wasn't built for comfort. 

The attic was her sanctuary, a cramped space under the eaves filled with dusty trunks, forgotten furniture, and the comforting scent of mothballs. Here, surrounded by the whispers of the past, she could lose herself in the worlds she created.  But today, even the familiar rhythm of rain couldn't drown out the gnawing doubt that plagued her. Her publisher was waiting for a completed manuscript, and Elara felt stuck, like a sparrow with clipped wings.
