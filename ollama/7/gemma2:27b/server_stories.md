The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow on Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes' worn sneakers as she trudged up the steps to The Rusty Spigot. It was 5:30pm, prime dinner rush hour, and the air already buzzed with a low thrum of anticipation. Inside, the familiar scent of stale beer, fried onions, and desperation hit Ellie like a wall. 

The Rusty Spigot wasn't exactly glamorous. Tucked away in a forgotten corner of the city, it was the kind of place people stumbled into rather than sought out. The booths were cracked vinyl, the lighting dim, and the patronsâ€¦well, they were a colorful bunch.  Ellie knew them all by name: gruff old men nursing lukewarm pints, weary couples arguing over reheated microwaved dinners, and lonely souls desperately seeking connection in the bottom of a glass. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension crackled through the air, thicker than the cigarette smoke that perpetually hung in the haze above the bar. Ellie straightened her apron, feeling a shiver run down her spine as she braced herself for whatever chaos the evening might bring.
