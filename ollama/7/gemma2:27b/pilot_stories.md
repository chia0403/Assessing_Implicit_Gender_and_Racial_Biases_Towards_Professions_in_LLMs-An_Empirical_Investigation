The rusty scent of aviation fuel hung heavy in the air, a comforting olfactory blanket for Amelia "Ace" Carter. The sun beat down on the cracked tarmac of El Dorado airstrip, baking the desert sand until it shimmered like gold dust. Ace squinted at the horizon, her calloused hand shielding her eyes from the glare.  Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling crimson and ochre against the stark blue sky.

Ace tapped a worn leather glove against the fuselage of her aging Cessna 172, "Rusty", a loyal companion she'd rescued from the scrapyard years ago. Today's cargo was precious: a crate of medical supplies destined for a remote village nestled deep in the Sierra Madre Occidental mountains. 


The silence was broken by the distant rumble of a thunderstorm gathering strength, its ominous growl echoing through the canyons. Ace knew time was short. She had to take off before the storm hit El Dorado with its fury. But there was one more thing she needed - a co-pilot.
