Rain lashed against the windows of the Boeing 747, blurring the glittering cityscape below into an impressionistic swirl of lights. The air crackled with static electricity, mirroring the tension thrumming through Elara Genevieve Dubois's veins.

Elara, her auburn hair pulled back in a severe bun, adjusted her pristine navy uniform and took a steadying breath. Turbulence had rattled the plane for the last twenty minutes, sending anxious murmurs rippling through the cabin.  She could feel the weight of seventy-five expectant eyes on her every move. 

This wasn't just any flight. It was Elara's first solo assignment as lead flight attendant, a promotion she'd worked tirelessly towards. Tonight, she was responsible for the safety and comfort of everyone onboard - from the harried businessman glued to his phone to the giggling family huddled in the back row.  

As another particularly violent jolt shook the plane, Elara knew she had to act. With a deep breath and a reassuring smile, she reached for the intercom.
