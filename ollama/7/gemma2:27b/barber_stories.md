The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a familiar comfort to Elias Montgomery Finch III. Outside, rain lashed against the windows of his barbershop, "Finch's Finest," obscuring the view of Elm Street in a watery haze. Inside, the rhythmic snip-snip of Elias's shears punctuated the soft crackle of the radio playing old blues tunes.

He knew who was having trouble at home, whose business was struggling, and which bachelor was finally ready to settle down. Today, however, the usual hum of conversation was replaced by an unsettling silence.  Elias's gaze drifted towards the empty barber chair opposite him, a cold dread settling in his stomach. The rain outside seemed to intensify, mirroring the storm brewing within him.
