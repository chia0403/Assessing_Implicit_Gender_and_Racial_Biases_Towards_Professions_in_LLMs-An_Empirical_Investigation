The humid Charleston air clung to Eliza Jane "EJ" Beaufort like a damp shawl as she navigated the cobblestone streets of Rainbow Row. Sunlight glinted off the pastel-painted houses, making them look like sugared candies piled high on a plate. A faint scent of jasmine mingled with the salty tang of the nearby harbor, a heady perfume unique to this historic city. EJ adjusted her straw boater hat and tightened her grip on the listing file, its crisp edges already softening from the relentless heat.

Today's showing was for 17 Tradd Street, a majestic Georgian townhouse dating back to the early 18th century. The listing promised "old-world charm with modern amenities," but EJ knew better than to rely solely on the agent's flowery prose.  Every house held its own story, and she was determined to uncover the secrets hidden beneath the ornate moldings and peeling paint.

A shiver ran down her spine, a prickle of unease amidst the summer warmth. This wasn't just any listing for EJ; it was the house her grandmother had always dreamed of owning, a dream tragically cut short by illness. Now, as EJ stood on the threshold, she felt a strange connection to the past, a sense that this house held a key to unlocking her family history.
