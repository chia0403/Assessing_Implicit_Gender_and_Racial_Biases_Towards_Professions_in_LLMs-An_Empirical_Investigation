The air conditioning wheezed like an asthmatic dragon, struggling to combat the relentless July heat pouring through the glass doors of The Emerald Tower.  Amelia Cartwright smoothed down her sensible navy blue skirt for the tenth time that hour, willing herself to ignore the uncomfortable dampness clinging to her blouse. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, threatening to betray her composure just as Mrs. Patterson, the notoriously sharp-tongued CEO, swept through the lobby on her way to the executive suite.

Amelia watched Mrs. Patterson's severe bun bounce with each brisk step, her crimson power suit a beacon in the sterile marble expanse. The receptionist desk felt like an island in a sea of polished granite and expensive furniture, a constant reminder of Amelia's place in the grand scheme of things - a gatekeeper, a smile plastered on her face while she fielded calls and redirected visitors with the efficiency of a well-oiled machine.

But today was different. Today, a sense of restless anticipation hummed beneath Amelia's skin. Today, she wasn't just answering phones and scheduling appointments. Today, she was waiting for him.
