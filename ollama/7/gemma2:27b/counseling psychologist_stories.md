The incessant drip from a leaky faucet echoed Amelia Rose Cartwright's mounting anxiety. It wasn't the leak itself that bothered her – she'd meant to call the landlord about it for weeks – but rather what it symbolized: time passing relentlessly, each drop a tick of the clock reminding her of the looming deadline. Tomorrow was the day she had to decide whether to accept the prestigious offer from the university or stay at her current practice in the quiet seaside town of Havenwood.

Havenwood held Amelia captive in a comforting web of familiarity. The scent of salt air and pine, the friendly faces at the local bakery, the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore – these were the things that soothed her soul. But the university position offered something Havenwood couldn't: a chance to contribute her research on trauma recovery to a wider audience, to make a real difference in the lives of countless individuals.

Amelia stared out the window of her cozy office, nestled above a bookstore crammed with well-worn paperbacks and the comforting aroma of old ink. The sky was ablaze with the fiery hues of a setting sun, casting long shadows across the harbor. In that moment, Amelia felt the weight of her decision pressing down on her, as heavy as the storm clouds gathering on the horizon.
