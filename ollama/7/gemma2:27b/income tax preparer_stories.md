Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon "Open" sign hanging precariously above Harold Finchley's cramped office door.

The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a potent cocktail brewed from months of relentless number crunching and the mounting anxiety of clients sweating their April 15th deadlines.

Harold sighed, pushing away another stack of crumpled receipts and W-2s. This year felt particularly brutal, a swarm of locusts devouring his sanity with each form filed.

But reality had a way of squashing dreams like overripe fruit, leaving behind a sticky residue of regret and resignation.
