The incessant clatter of the typewriter keys was Amelia Rose Hathaway's metronome. Each click-clack echoed in the cavernous office, bouncing off the mahogany desks and towering bookshelves that lined the walls.

Outside, the city rumbled with its usual midday chaos - a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and hawkers' cries blending into a discordant melody. But within the four walls of Mr. Hawthorne's office, Amelia existed in a bubble of order, meticulously transcribing his hurried dictation and filing away endless reams of paper.
