The air in the cramped workshop crackled with static electricity as Elias Montgomery adjusted the frequency dial on an old Zenith Transoceanic. Dust motes danced in the beam of his headlamp, illuminating rows of vacuum tubes and tangled wires spilling out from open chassis like metallic intestines. Outside, a storm raged, wind whipping rain against the corrugated iron roof, drumming a relentless rhythm that punctuated Elias’s work.

Elias wasn't bothered by the storm. In fact, he often found solace in its wild symphony. The howling wind and crashing thunder felt like companions, kindred spirits in this isolated world of his own making. He lived for these moments – hunched over a forgotten radio, coaxing it back to life, deciphering the whispers of a long-lost era.

Tonight, however, the storm felt different. It carried an unsettling energy, a prickle on the skin that Elias couldn't quite shake off. As he tightened a connection with his screwdriver, a sudden surge of power jolted through the radio, throwing sparks across the workbench. The room plunged into darkness.
