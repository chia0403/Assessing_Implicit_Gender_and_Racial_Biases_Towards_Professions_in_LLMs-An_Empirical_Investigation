Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Finnegan's office, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of gray on the cracked pavement outside. The air hung heavy with the smell of damp wool and stale coffee, punctuated by the insistent tick-tock of a grandfather clock that Bart swore was perpetually five minutes slow. He stared out at the dreary cityscape, the neon glow of the pawn shop across the street reflecting forlornly in his tired eyes.

Bart wasn't built for this kind of weather.  He preferred sunshine and crisp air, the kind of days that made you want to lace up your sneakers and go for a run. But today was a day for hunkering down, for burying himself in paperwork and trying to ignore the gnawing emptiness in his stomach. He'd been an insurance agent for ten years now, ever since he graduated from college with a degree in finance that seemed about as useful as a chocolate teapot.

He sighed, pushing away a stack of policy renewals.  His phone buzzed on the desk, startling him. It was Mrs. Oâ€™Malley, calling to inquire about her homeowner's insurance. Bart plastered on his best customer service smile and answered the call, bracing himself for another round of existential dread disguised as small talk.
