The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation. Elara Reyes stared at the screen, her reflection staring back, hollow-eyed and weary. The deadline loomed like a guillotine, its blade sharpened by the impatient emails from the client.

Elara ran a hand through her tangled black curls, a sigh escaping her lips. She needed inspiration, a spark to ignite the stagnant creativity within.  The cityscape beyond her window, normally a source of vibrant energy, seemed muted tonight, mirroring her own exhaustion.  Perhaps a walk would help clear her head, she thought, pushing away from her desk and grabbing her worn leather jacket.
