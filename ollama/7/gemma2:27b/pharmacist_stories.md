Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Haven Pharmacy, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a watery smear. Inside, Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne meticulously counted out twenty-seven ibuprofen tablets, her movements precise and rhythmic despite the gnawing anxiety twisting in her gut. The bell above the door jingled, announcing a customer just as the storm reached its crescendo.

Eleanor straightened, her white coat crisp against the worn, wooden counter. Her pharmacy wasn't much to look at â€“ tucked away on a quiet street corner in the heart of Ashton, a town slowly succumbing to the economic downturn that gripped the nation. But for Eleanor, Haven Pharmacy was more than just bricks and mortar; it was a lifeline, a sanctuary, a testament to her late grandfather who had founded it decades ago.
