The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, barely masking the faint tang of disinfectant. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path. Dr. Eleanor Vance sighed, her knuckles cracking as she adjusted the lumbar support on her ergonomic chair. Outside, a symphony of city noise – car horns blaring, sirens wailing – underscored the quiet hum of her practice. It was a Tuesday, just past noon, and Eleanor hadn't seen a single patient yet. 

She glanced at the clock, its hands mockingly ticking towards her lunch break. A pang of loneliness stabbed her chest. Ever since she’d moved her practice from bustling downtown to this quieter neighborhood, business had been slow.  Perhaps it was the location, tucked away on a leafy side street. Or maybe it was the lingering misconception that chiropractors were just “bone crackers,” not real doctors.

Eleanor knew better. Years of rigorous study and countless hours spent refining her craft had taught her the intricate dance between skeletal structure and nervous system function. She could alleviate chronic pain, improve mobility, and even help patients regain a sense of well-being they thought lost forever. 


But today, she felt like a forgotten melody playing to an empty room. Just as Eleanor was about to give in to despair, the bell above her door jingled merrily, announcing the arrival of her first patient of the day.
