Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. Inside, the only sound louder than the relentless drumming on glass was the frantic clacking of Alistair's keyboard. Spreadsheets glowed on his monitor, each cell a tiny battlefield in his war against a looming audit deadline. He pushed his wire-rimmed glasses further up his nose, squinting at a particularly stubborn discrepancy. The air in the cramped office hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. 

Alistair Finch wasn't your typical accountant. While others might find solace in neat rows and tidy columns, he craved something more. He longed for adventure, for a life less ordinary than balancing budgets and reconciling accounts. Little did he know that the rain-soaked night outside held the key to unlocking everything he ever dreamed of.
