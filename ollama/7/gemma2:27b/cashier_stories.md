The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the rows of dented canned goods and wilting produce. Evelyn Cartwright sighed, her fingers drumming a tired rhythm against the chipped countertop.  It was 2:17 am, the witching hour at Big Bob's Bargain Bonanza, when the only customers were insomniacs with cravings for pickled pigs feet or truckers needing a caffeine fix before hitting the highway. Tonight, however, even the usual late-night clientele seemed to be avoiding the discount aisles.

Evelyn stared out the grime-coated window, watching the shadows dance on the deserted parking lot. A lone streetlamp flickered pathetically in the distance, casting long, grotesque fingers across the asphalt.  She longed for the sun, for the bustle of day shoppers and the comforting chatter of her colleagues. But until then, she was alone with the silence, broken only by the whirring of the refrigerators and the occasional groan of the aging floorboards.
