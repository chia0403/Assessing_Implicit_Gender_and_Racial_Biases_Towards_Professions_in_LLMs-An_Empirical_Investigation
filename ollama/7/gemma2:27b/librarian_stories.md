Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, mimicking the incessant drumming in Elara Hawthorne's chest. The ancient building, built from the same dark, polished wood as its namesake forest, usually hummed with a comforting silence broken only by the rustle of turning pages and the occasional cough. But tonight, the storm had driven away all but Elara, leaving her alone amidst towering shelves crammed with centuries-old tales.

A particularly fierce gust rattled the stained-glass window depicting a mythical griffin guarding a stack of books. Elara shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around her. She'd always felt a kinship with the creatures in those ancient stories – the lonely dragons, the wise owls, the mischievous sprites – finding solace in their fantastical worlds. Tonight, however, she longed for something more tangible: a cup of tea, perhaps, or the reassuring presence of another soul. 

Then, a sound sliced through the storm's roar – a heavy thud followed by muffled cursing coming from the library's depths. Elara's heart skipped a beat. No one had ever broken into the Grand Blackwood Library before, not in her thirty years as its caretaker.
