The incessant drip from a leaky faucet in Estelle Marie Beaumont's studio apartment was starting to drive her mad. It punctuated every thought, every sketch, every dream. Ironically, for a woman who crafted spaces that felt like sanctuaries, her own space was anything but. Paint peeled from the water-damaged ceiling, and the once-vibrant rug Estelle had salvaged from a Victorian mansion now sported a suspicious yellow stain of unknown origin. 

It wasn't always like this. Estelle had once lived in a spacious loft overlooking the Hudson River, a testament to her successful interior design career. But after a string of bad luck - a failed partnership, an unexpected illness, and the subsequent drain on her savings - she found herself downsizing, both physically and professionally. 

Now, she was taking on smaller projects: sprucing up local cafes, rearranging furniture for overwhelmed college students, even staging apartments for online real estate listings. It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills, barely. Today, however, a glimmer of hope had arrived in the form of an email. A potential client, a Ms. Eleanor Sinclair, was looking to transform her dilapidated Victorian manor into a haven of elegance and whimsy.

Estelle stared at the email, her heart pounding like a hummingbird's wings. This could be her chance - a chance to showcase her talents, to rebuild her reputation, maybe even reclaim a piece of the life she once knew. With a deep breath and a flicker of determination in her tired eyes, Estelle grabbed her battered portfolio and headed out into the drizzly afternoon, the leaky faucet momentarily forgotten.
