The scent of lavender shampoo and burnt hair hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Esme Eloise Davenport, proprietor of "Esme's Emporium of Exquisite Cuts." The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing over faded floral wallpaper and a chipped porcelain poodle perched atop a rusted metal cabinet. Outside, the bustling cacophony of Market Street in Charleston seeped into the salon, a counterpoint to the gentle whirring of Esme's hair dryer.

Esme, her silver curls escaping their bun, expertly wielded the dryer, her eyes closed in concentration as she sculpted Mrs. Patterson's bouffant into a perfect cloud.
