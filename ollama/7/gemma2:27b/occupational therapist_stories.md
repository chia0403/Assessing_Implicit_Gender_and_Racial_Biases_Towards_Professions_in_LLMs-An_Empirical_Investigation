Rain lashed against the windows of the Havenwood Rehabilitation Center, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Blackwood's chest.  The stale smell of antiseptic and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, doing little to mask the underlying scent of fear and frustration that seemed to permeate the very walls. Today was Elara’s first day back at Havenwood after a six-month leave, and her stomach churned with a mixture of apprehension and excitement. 

She'd left Havenwood reeling from a personal tragedy, needing time to heal and regroup. Now, standing in the bustling therapy room, surrounded by familiar faces – nurses, aides, other therapists – she felt a pang of longing for the comfort of anonymity.  But Elara knew this was where she belonged. Helping others regain their strength, both physical and emotional, was her calling, her purpose.
