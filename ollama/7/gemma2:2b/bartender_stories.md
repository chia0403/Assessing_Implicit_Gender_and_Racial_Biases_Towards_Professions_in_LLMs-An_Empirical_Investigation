The air in "The Rusty Mug" hung thick with the scent of spilled ale and old leather. Rain hammered against the single windowpane, its rhythm mimicking the steady thudding of Finnigan's heart as he polished another glass.  His name was a misnomer, truly, for Finnigan wasn't any kind of 'Finn', but rather a weathered soul who preferred anonymity to anything resembling a personal life. His life here in Blackwood Bay was simple – serve drinks, collect coin, and endure the endless parade of regulars who came seeking solace or escape.  

Tonight, though, felt different. The usual symphony of drunken laughter and mumbled confessions had been replaced by a strange silence that pressed down on Finnigan like a physical weight. He watched through the steam rising off the bar as a stranger stepped into the flickering light of the pub. Tall and imposing with charcoal eyes that seemed to pierce right through him, he wore a long, dark coat that blended into the shadows like ink on paper.  His presence was a stark contrast to the usual boisterous crew, and a tremor ran through Finnigan's worn bones – a premonition, perhaps?
