The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the chipped Formica table where  Elias Thorne sat hunched over. It wasn't just the mundane boredom of his job that was wearing him down; it was the palpable unease emanating from his newest client. Across from him sat Michael "Mikey" Jackson, 19-year-old, all sharp angles and too-loud music playing on his phone.  His hands nervously twisted a worn leather bracelet he couldn't afford to lose.

Elias, with ten years under his belt in the probation department, had dealt with countless kids like Mikey. But something about this one felt different. The weight of a past that stretched beyond what Elias could see hung heavy around him, even through the thin walls of the makeshift office.  A low throb seemed to emanate from Mikey's chest, like a trapped bird struggling to escape its cage. 

The setting was an abandoned community center in the shadow of a decaying apartment block, a crumbling monument to promises long forgotten. Outside, the city hummed with a frenetic energy, a million stories playing out simultaneously, but inside, time seemed to have stopped. This was where hope and desperation collided, where broken dreams met shattered ceilings, echoing the same silence that filled Michael's soul.
