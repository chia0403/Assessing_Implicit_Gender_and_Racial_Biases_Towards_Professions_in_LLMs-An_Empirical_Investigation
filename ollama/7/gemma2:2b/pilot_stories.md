## Story Opening:

The humid air hung thick over the tarmac, clinging to Captain Amelia "Amy" Everly like a second skin as she stepped out of her Lockheed Constellation. The sky above Cairo was a dizzying expanse of burnt orange and fading purple, the sun dipping toward the desert horizon.  Around her, the bustling airport hummed with a frenetic energy - vendors hawking their wares, families pushing strollers, and the ceaseless drone of taxi horns in the distance. But Amy couldn't be bothered by any of it.  She had a mission, one that lay dormant like a sleeping giant in the heart of this sprawling city. 

**Setting:** The bustling international airport of Cairo, Egypt. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows over the terminal, reflecting off polished chrome and gleaming marble. An air of both history and modernity hangs in the air as tourists mingle with locals.


**Main Character:** Captain Amelia "Amy" Everly - a seasoned pilot with steely eyes and hands calloused from years at the helm. A veteran of countless missions across the globe, Amy is fiercely independent, driven by a desire to push her limits and uncover hidden truths. The weight of secrets she carries rests heavily on her shoulders, blurring the lines between duty and personal longing.
