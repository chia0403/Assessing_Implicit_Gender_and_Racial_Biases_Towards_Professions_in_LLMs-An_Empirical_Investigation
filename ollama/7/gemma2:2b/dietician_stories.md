Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Iris Blackwood's cozy office, mimicking the incessant drumming in her head. Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the turmoil within her own mind. The weight of it all felt as heavy as the thick stew she had been struggling to make for months – a metaphor that was proving tragically accurate. 

The name "Iris Blackwood" hung on the door like an unwelcome shadow, a reminder of the promise she'd made to herself and her family: never again would she abandon the practice of medicine that brought her genuine happiness.  She’d become a dietician, a choice driven by desperation, the need for something more than just treating the symptoms. The once vibrant, enthusiastic Iris was now a shadow of her former self, consumed by the same endless cycle of grief and frustration.

The storm outside had been raging for days, mirroring the tempest in her own heart - a yearning for resolution that threatened to drown her beneath its fury. As she stared at the steaming bowl of stew, it finally hit her: maybe she was meant to find the answer not through calculations and meal plans, but through something more profound, something as wild and unpredictable as the storm outside.
