The sun was already dipping below the horizon, painting the snow-dusted peaks of the Rocky Mountains in hues of orange and red. Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Westfall crouched beneath the canvas overhang of her veterinary clinic's porch, watching the last sliver of daylight fade into darkness. A symphony of crackling fireflies began to dance amongst the pines nearby, a gentle counterpoint to the howling wind whistling through the valley. Inside the warmth of the clinic, the scent of antiseptic and disinfectant hung heavy in the air. Ellie rubbed her weary eyes; another long day at the ranch had worn her down. 

Her small town clinic was nestled on the outskirts of Meadowbrook, Colorado - a haven for ranchers and their animals alike. Though she'd always dreamt of working with endangered species in Africa, a life in the wilds of Montana had pulled her here. The ranch work provided both income and a connection to the land; it was also where she first discovered an unbreakable bond with horses, an affinity that made treating them a personal responsibility beyond just animal care.  

Tonight, however, was different. Ellie hadn't been called out for a routine check-up or a sick cow - her call today involved something far more unusual: a request for help from the ranch owners, who swore they were being haunted by aâ€¦ 'spirited companion.'
