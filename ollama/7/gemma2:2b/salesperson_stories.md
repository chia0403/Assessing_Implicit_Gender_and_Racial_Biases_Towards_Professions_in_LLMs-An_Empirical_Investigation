## Opening

**Setting:** A crowded flea market in late August, New England sunshine beating down on tables overflowing with mismatched trinkets.  Cobblestones beneath worn shoes. The air hangs heavy with the smell of sunscreen, hot dogs, and something vaguely floral, possibly mothballs. 

**Characters:**

* **Evelyn "Eve" Thorne:** Early twenties, sharp-eyed and quick to a smile, Eve works as a salesperson at the flea market, hawking a collection of vintage postcards she meticulously arranges on her table. 


**Opening lines:**

"Looking for a little bit of history in your life?" Eve's voice rings out above the chatter of vendors and shoppers. "Donâ€™t just live the present; travel through time!"  She holds up a faded postcard, the sun glinting off the image of a Parisian street bustling with life. 
"Would you like to step back into a bygone era, my dear?" Eve asks with an almost conspiratorial wink. The woman before her takes a step closer, eyes wide.


**What's next?**

Will she sell a postcard? Will the woman be drawn in further by the promise of history and escape? Does Eve have secrets buried within those vintage postcards that might change the course of this encounter?
