## Setting:

The year is 1978. A blistering wind whips through the rusty steel canyons of Chicago's west side, carrying with it the scent of rain and decaying asphalt. The concrete blocks that make up countless buildings line the streets like hardened bones, some crumbling under the weight of time while others still stand defiant against the relentless march of urban decay. 

It's not a pretty sight, this corner of Chicago, but to Finn "The Hammer" McCreedy, it's home.  He leans precariously on the edge of his rusted Ford pickup, its paint as faded and weathered as the old buildings around him. 

## Character: 

Finn McCreedy, or "The Hammer" as he was known by everyone in town, is a roofer with calloused hands, a worn face, and a heart that still beats for the wind whistling through his weathered clothes and the creaking of wooden structures.  At 52 years old, he's seen more rain than anyone else on these streets and knows every nook and cranny of this neighborhood like the back of his hand.

His hands, rough as bark but skilled enough to sculpt a roof into perfect symmetry with just a few flicks of the hammer, are the only tools that truly matter to him.  He's built countless homes in this town, each one a testament to his quiet dedication and skill. But Finn has always felt like a solitary man, his closest companion being the wind and the rhythm of his work.


**Start:**

"Another storm coming," Finn mumbled, glancing towards the grey horizon where the first fat raindrops were beginning to prickle against the sky.  He wiped the sweat from his brow, a familiar feeling as old as the building codes he followed with such unwavering precision. 

Finn surveyed his worksite: a modest two-story brick apartment building whose facade had already seen its fair share of storms. He'd spent the last few hours battling the elements, replacing a rotten section of roof that had sprung a leak earlier in the afternoon, and he felt a strange sense of satisfaction with every nail hammered into place. 

The phone rang, snapping him back to reality.  It was Mrs. Kowalski, his newest client. She was a quiet woman whose home seemed as neglected as its crumbling porch steps, yet she held an unwavering faith in Finn's skill that was both comforting and unsettling. He'd promised her a roof strong enough to withstand a hurricane – even if he didn’t know what storm they were building up for. 


And just like the wind itself, his job had a certain unpredictable unpredictability about it.  He knew that as long as there were rooftops in need of repair, Finn McCreedy would be there. He was part of this city's fabric, woven into its very being, and he wouldn’t have it any other way.
