## The Crimson Tide

**Setting:**  The decaying docks of Duskhaven, a coastal town shrouded in perpetual twilight. Salt air hangs heavy, carrying whispers of forgotten stories and swirling with the ever-present stench of fish and brine. 

**Main Character:** Elara "Ellie" Blackwood, a young journalist with eyes that hold both fire and frost, driven by an insatiable thirst for truth. She wears her worn trench coat like armor, its pockets overflowing with notebooks and crumpled cigarette papers.  

Ellie's latest story takes a sharp turn as she steps onto the rickety pier, sunlight fading away like a dying ember. A lone figure stands silhouetted against the dying sun - a man dressed in an old sailor's garb, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. His presence feels almost too heavy for the mundane setting, and Ellie senses something more than just a stranger. 

"You wanted to talk," the man rasped, his voice like sea glass rubbing against stone. 
 
Ellie stares at him, her eyes burning with curiosity and a hint of unease. This is Duskhaven's whispered secret, the city’s dark heart pulsing under layers of grime and myth. 


"Yes, Mr...?" Ellie asks, holding out a hand tentatively. 

He doesn't respond, simply turning his gaze to the churning sea. A single glint catches her eye - a crimson tear glistening in the depths of his faded eye socket, mirroring the blood-red tide slowly creeping towards the city’s heart.
