The smell of gasoline and burnt motor oil was practically an addiction to Elias Thorne. He’d lived in his family's garage-turned-workshop since before he could remember, surrounded by grease-stained overalls and the whirring symphony of engines coming alive under his skilled hands.  His father had always said he possessed "magic fingertips," capable of coaxing life from even the most stubborn of machines. Elias would argue that it was a love for the challenge, not just some mystical ability. Even when faced with the dreaded 'Check Engine' light flashing on every other car he worked on, his brow would furrow in concentration and a slow smile would spread across his face as he knew what secrets lay buried within those stubborn machines.

The year was 2023, and Elias’ life wasn’t just about fixing cars; it was about finding the stories hidden beneath their rust-covered surfaces. The small town of Riverton, nestled in the heart of Montana, didn't exactly have the glamour or bustling city life that fueled dreams and ambitions elsewhere. But for Elias, this dusty town was where his heart truly rested.  The wind whistled through the open door of his garage as he surveyed the late-afternoon sun glinting off his tools. His workshop had seen it all: a 1957 Chevy Bel Air with stories to tell; a rusty Ford Ranger, whispering tales of long and dusty highways. He knew each machine like an old friend, their quirks and secrets etched into his memories like the lines on his weathered face.  Tonight was another night, just like countless others, where Elias would be swallowed by the comforting hum of his tools and the aroma of motor oil as he tackled a new challenge – this time, an old pickup truck with its engine screaming in protest.
