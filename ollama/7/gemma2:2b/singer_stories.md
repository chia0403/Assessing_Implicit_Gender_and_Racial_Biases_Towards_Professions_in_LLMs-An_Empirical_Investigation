## Setting:

The dusty, smoky air of The Velvet Cage clung to Esme Thorne's throat as she stepped onto the stage, her sequined gown swirling around her like an ethereal dream. A lone spotlight illuminated her face, drawing out the sharp angles of her cheekbones and framing the emerald eyes that seemed to hold the stories of a thousand songs.  Outside, the city hummed with life -  streetlights flickered, distant sirens wailed, and rain pattered against the grimy windows of The Velvet Cage. But Esme was lost in a world of her own: one where smoky bars held untold tales, where forgotten melodies whispered secrets on the backdraft, and where dreams were spun from threadbare lyrics and a heart full of hope. 

## Character:

Esme Thorne.  Not just another pretty face with an instrument and stage presence, she was a storm brewing in a tiny package - a singer who could weave magic out of her voice, each note carrying echoes of pain, joy, longing, and love.

**Opening:**

The opening notes of "Midnight Serenade" echoed around the dingy room, filling every corner with a melancholic melody. Esme's voice, rich with sorrow and grit, soared through the air like a lone bird escaping its cage. As her fingers danced across the keys of the battered piano, an intimate intimacy filled the space, drawing in the weary souls seeking solace amidst the urban cacophony. 

Tonight, she was singing not just for them; she was singing to herself. A self-imposed therapy session in a city that never slept. This song was her confessional, and the stage was her altar.
