The aroma of stale coffee and anxiety hung thick in the air of Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood's classroom. The worn carpet felt as familiar as her own skin under Dr. Amelia Grant's worn shoes.  Amelia, with years of experience simmering beneath the surface of her calm demeanor, stood before a kaleidoscope of anxieties: a fidgeting sixth-grader named Kevin whose eyes darted like startled birds, an overly-enthusiastic fourth grader named Lily whose boundless energy threatened to crack the quiet room’s facade, and little Liam, who sat rigidly in his chair with an air of quiet despair. 

It was Wednesday – "Focus Day" as it was dubbed by Principal Patterson – a day where each child had to face their internal demons, guided by the school psychologist's compassionate hand. But this time, something felt off. There was a knot of unease Amelia couldn't quite untangle, like a threadbare sweater pulled too tight. It clung to her like the weight of unspoken fears, pulling at her own emotional resilience.  The classroom door creaked open, a sliver of sunlight illuminating Mrs. Blackwood's expectant face, and Amelia took a deep breath. Today, she couldn’t just read minds. She had to decipher the labyrinthine landscape of their inner lives.
