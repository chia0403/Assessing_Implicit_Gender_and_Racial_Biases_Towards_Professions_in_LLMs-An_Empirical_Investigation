The air hung thick and heavy in the humid summer heat, clinging to Evelyn Thorne like a second skin as she stood before her newest group of tourists.  Sweat beaded on her forehead under her bright green Panama hat, reflecting the blinding sun above. “Welcome to New Orleans!” her voice boomed over the clattering of trolley wheels against cobblestone streets. 

It was a Wednesday in July, and Evelyn’s favorite time of year: the sweltering days of summer brought out the best (and worst) of the city's vibrant personality. The French Quarter thrummed with life - voodoo shops lining Royal Street, ornate balconies adorned with flowering vines spilling over into narrow alleyways, jazz music emanating from every corner, and a scent of beignets mingling with old money and raw excitement.  

New Orleans wasn’t just a city; it was an experience, and Evelyn was the conductor, leading guests through its labyrinthine streets and hidden corners.
