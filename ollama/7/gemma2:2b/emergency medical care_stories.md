It was a scene she had witnessed countless times in her decade-long career - another victim of the city's relentless chaos.  The rhythmic thrumming of sirens from the distant intersection filled the air as the blue and red lights flickered like fireflies, casting long, dancing shadows across the grimy brick wall of the abandoned warehouse. Ameliaâ€™s face, weathered by years of battling life's brutal twists and turns, held a mixture of professional detachment and growing unease.  A young mother lay vulnerable in this forgotten space, her future as unclear as the city's skyline at dusk.
