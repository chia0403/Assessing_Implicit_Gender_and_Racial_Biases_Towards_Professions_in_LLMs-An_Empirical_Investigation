## Setting: The Salt-Kissed Streets of Galveston

The humid air hung thick as molasses over Galveston Island, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Carter's worn leather coat like a second skin.  Waves crashed against the seawall, their rhythmic roar barely audible above the drone of cicadas and the distant cries of gulls. Her worn Nikon lay heavy in her hand, its chrome reflecting the bruised hues of twilight that bled across the sky. Amy's camera felt as familiar as her own heartbeat, a comforting weight nestled between her calloused fingers.

She stood on the edge of Seawall Boulevard, a place where history and reality collided like waves against rocks.  It was a notorious spot for tourists and those seeking the infamous "Galveston Lights," ethereal flashes of light that illuminated the sea just before sunset. But Amy preferred to linger here, capturing the city's soul through the lens of her camera.

She wasn't after the tourist traps. The neon-lit bars and their garish facades were a far cry from the melancholy beauty she sought - the forgotten stories etched onto weathered wooden planks, the whispers of secrets held captive in the swaying palm trees.  Tonight, Amy was looking for something more - a glimpse into the hidden life pulsing beneath Galveston's vibrant fa√ßade.
