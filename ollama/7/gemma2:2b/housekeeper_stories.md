The morning mist clung to Blackwood Manor like a reluctant ghost, its chill seeping through Amelia's worn cardigan even as she stood at the front door.  She sighed, pulling her thin scarf tighter around her neck. The house itself seemed to mirror the cold: a majestic Victorian behemoth with peeling paint and dusty balconies, its once vibrant colours now faded to the hues of despair. 

Ameliaâ€™s name was Amelia Thorne, and she had been entrusted with the upkeep of Blackwood Manor for the past two decades.  Her life revolved around its rhythm - cleaning dust from forgotten corners, mending broken china left in a shadowed cabinet, feeding the pigeons that had taken up residence on the roof. Her days were long, her pay meager, but it was a duty she held close to her heart; a duty born from quiet desperation and a deep affection for the family that owned this house: the Earnshaw's.  They were gone now, leaving only echoes of laughter in their empty rooms. 

As Amelia turned the knob, the familiar creak of the hinges resonated like a silent lament. The air within was thick with memories, both joyous and sorrowful, each one waiting to be rediscovered. She knew this place well; every shadow, every rustle of silk curtains, every cobweb in the library's grand fireplace held secrets that only she could decipher.  Today was no different.
