Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Iron & Ink" studio, each drop sounding like a tiny explosion. Inside, Amelia Weaver huddled deeper into her woolen sweater, its warmth a meager shield against the October chill. The workshop was a tangle of blueprints, metal scraps and wood shavings, where drafts came alive on the page before being molded into reality by her nimble fingers. She felt a familiar pang of disappointment as she glanced at her latest project: the towering glass and steel contraption that was supposed to be an architectural marvel for the city’s upcoming expo – a testament to her burgeoning skill and ambition. But it had stalled. Again. 

The problem wasn't Amelia's design. It was the budget.  Funding from the city council had been cut, leaving her with a project barely funded, lacking crucial elements like the automated scaffolding system that was supposed to allow for safe construction on its towering heights. The deadline loomed; the expo was only three months away. 

She let out a weary sigh, rubbing her tired eyes. Amelia was good at drafting - she'd learned it from her father, a renowned architect who had instilled in her a love for precision and imagination. He'd taught her to find beauty in the simplest lines, and that there was power in expressing emotions through structure and form. But even his legacy couldn't shield her from the crushing reality of the limited resources. 

The rain continued its relentless assault on the workshop, blurring the outside world into a watercolor wash of grey and brown. It felt like everything had been shrinking lately - her vision, her dreams, the scope of her ambition. This was not how she’d envisioned her life; this wasn't supposed to be the reality where talent felt like a mere flicker in a storm-tossed sea.
