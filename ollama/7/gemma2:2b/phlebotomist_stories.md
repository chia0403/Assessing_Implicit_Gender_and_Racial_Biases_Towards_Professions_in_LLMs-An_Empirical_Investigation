Every day at St. Jude's General Hospital felt identical - same stained white uniforms, same sterile corridors, same tired patients and their weary stories.  Amelia, a name whispered with reverence by seasoned phlebotomists but rarely uttered by the nervous young ones joining her ranks, was practically a ghost in this haven of medical miracles. 

Her hands, calloused yet gentle like weathered leather, hovered over a young man's arm as he shivered beneath a thin blanket.  His face, pale and etched with anxiety, held a thousand unspoken fears. "Just another routine draw," Amelia murmured, her voice betraying no more than the faintest hint of exhaustion. She dipped her needle into the test tube, its contents swirling with a sickly yellow hue, mirroring the uncertainty in his eyes.

Amelia knew this well â€“ she had lived through countless such tests, witnessing life ebb and flow within its walls, each patient leaving their own unique story etched in her memory.  But as she looked at the young man's face, a silent question echoed in her mind: where would he go after this test? Where would his story take him?
