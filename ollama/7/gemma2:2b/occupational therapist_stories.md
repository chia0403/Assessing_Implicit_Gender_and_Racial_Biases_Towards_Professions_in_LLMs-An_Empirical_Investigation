The late afternoon sun dripped like melting wax across the weathered floors of Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center, painting long, dusty shadows from the ceiling fans.  Inside one of the therapy rooms, the aroma of old disinfectant and antiseptic clung to the air, thick enough to suffocate. It was here that Amelia Croft, a woman whose smile could mend broken bones, found herself battling another kind of battle – against the insidious grip of apathy.

Amelia’s gaze fell upon her next patient, Mr. Henderson. A stoic man with eyes filled with lost dreams, he sat hunched on the edge of his wheelchair, his limbs stiff and unmoving. Just a few weeks ago, Amelia had helped him regain the ability to write again after a stroke left him paralyzed on one side.  But today, even that small victory seemed distant as Mr. Henderson stared blankly at the wall, seemingly swallowed by the silence that hung like a shroud. 

He was an enigma wrapped in a man-sized frown; his story, fragmented like the shards of broken glass lying scattered across his therapy table. Amelia needed to get through to him before the apathy took root and consumed his spirit entirely.


**Here are some possible directions you could take this opening:**

* **Focus on the internal conflict:**  Amelia's own struggles with her career, perhaps a past trauma she's trying to overcome or a personal challenge affecting her ability to connect.
* **Build suspense:** The story can start with Mr. Henderson's apathy and its impact on Amelia, leaving us wondering why he's this way. Is it physical, emotional, or something else entirely?  Is there an underlying reason behind his resistance to therapy?
* **Introduce a supporting character:** A fellow therapist, a colleague who suspects something is amiss with Mr. Henderson, or even a curious family member could add depth and complexity to the story.
