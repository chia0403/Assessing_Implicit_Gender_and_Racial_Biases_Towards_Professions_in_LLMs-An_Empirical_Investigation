The salt spray whipped Amelia's grey hair across her face as she leaned against the railing of the pier, staring out at the churning sea. Her calloused hands gripped the edge, knuckles white.  A cold wind bit at her cheeks, making the damp wool sweater on her frame feel like a thin, flimsy shield. She hadn't been this close to the water since she was a girl, back when her father used to drag her along for fishing trips with him. 

Amelia had always felt more comfortable amidst the steady rhythm of scissors and clippers in her small, cluttered barbershop. The scent of lavender soap and the gentle creak of chairs filled her days, not the salty tang of the sea or the harsh cries of gulls.  But life was rarely about choosing what one wanted. It was about accepting fate's cruel hand, she knew that now, more than ever. 

Her name echoed through the quiet air as she turned to face the bustling street market: "Amelia Harding," it murmured, a familiar weight on her lips. A small sigh escaped her lips as she watched the life seep out of the weathered faces of the people around her. The setting was one of decay and fading glory, yet there was beauty hidden within its cracks – like sunlight on a cobblestone street, casting dancing patterns that Amelia found oddly comforting.
