The crisp autumn air carried the scent of woodsmoke and fallen leaves as Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins meticulously cleaned his cleaver, each swipe leaving a clean line across its polished surface. His small shop in the heart of Oakhaven Village hummed with the quiet murmur of morning routines - an elderly woman selecting a slab of bacon for her Sunday brunch, a family chatting about their plans for the day, and the rhythmic clang of Mrs. O'Connell’s pots echoing from down the street. Bart himself was caught in his own world, the familiar rhythm of butchering grounding him amidst the bustling life around him. 

Bartholomew had known every curve of this wood-paneled shop since he was a boy, learning from his father to wield the cleaver with precision and grace.  He’d grown into it, filling its space with an air of quiet dignity that seemed as much a part of the building's character as the aged oak counter or the dusty shelves filled with cured hams and sausages. Tonight, however, the usual calm was disrupted. A storm brewed over Oakhaven, turning the normally gentle wind to a fierce gale. The sky churned grey, spitting rain like angry needles against the windowpanes.  Bart looked out into the tempestuous world beyond the shop, his gaze lingering on a single, battered package tucked away in the corner – something he couldn't quite decipher.
