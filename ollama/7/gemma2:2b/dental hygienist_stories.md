The air in Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Montgomery's tiny apartment was thick with the scent of bleach and citrus-infused mouthwash. The late afternoon sun slanted through the blinds, casting long shadows across Eve’s worn leather armchair.  Her usual routine had become a comfort zone – a haven from the constant bustle of her job as a dental hygienist at Dr. Smith's clinic. 

Eve flipped open her laptop, its screen buzzing to life. The familiar green interface displayed the patient list for the upcoming week. It was always a challenge balancing her love for helping people achieve pearly-white smiles with the ever-present reality of their anxieties about the inevitable – cleaning their teeth.  Her own teeth, however, were a source of self-confinement. A tiny chip on the front tooth, the constant reminder of an accidental run-in with a stray drill bit back in college. 

The clatter of her neighbor’s dog, Sparky, who was currently being let out for his afternoon stroll, echoed through the window. The sound was both jarring and oddly comforting to Eve – it provided a sense of familiarity amidst the ever-changing symphony of city life that surrounded her.  She sighed, pushing away the laptop and grabbing a can of soda from the fridge, hoping a little escape from reality would ease the day's looming challenges.
