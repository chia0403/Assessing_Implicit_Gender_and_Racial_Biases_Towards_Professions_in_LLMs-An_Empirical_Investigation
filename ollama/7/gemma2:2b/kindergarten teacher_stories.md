## Setting: The Sunshine Academy Kindergarten

Sunlight streamed through the open windows of Miss Penelope Primrose's classroom at the Sunshine Academy.  It dappled the floor in shifting squares of light and shadow as if dancing to an unseen rhythm. Posters featuring smiling children with rainbow-colored hair adorned the walls, while colourful beanbags, a miniature grocery store playset, and a well-loved teddy bear stand held firm amidst the chaos of early childhood development. 

Penelope Primrose, a woman whose smile rivaled the morning sun itself, was already prepping for another whirlwind day at Sunshine Academy.  Her auburn hair fell over her freckled face in waves as she hummed softly to herself, adjusting a stack of brightly colored activity books with practiced ease. The air hung thick with anticipation, punctuated by the joyful shrieks and giggles of children arriving for their daily dose of imagination and discovery. 

**But something wasn't quite right.** Penelope noticed it first - the stillness in Mrs. Johnson's usually bubbly voice as she greeted the new students; a disquiet that seemed to hang over the entire room like a thick fog. Something about today felt different, darker even. As a child's quiet wail broke through the usual cacophony of excitement, Penelope knew this day would be anything but ordinary.
