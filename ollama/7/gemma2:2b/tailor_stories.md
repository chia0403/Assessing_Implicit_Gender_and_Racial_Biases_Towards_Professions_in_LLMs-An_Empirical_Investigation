The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air as Elara stitched with practiced ease. The rhythmic click of her needles was the only sound besides the distant murmur of the city of Aethelgard, which was already waking from its slumber under the morning sun. Elara's small workshop, tucked away on a cobblestone street that wound through a tangle of ancient trees, felt like an oasis of calm amidst the bustling energy of the market district. 

Her shop, aptly named "Stitches of Grace", stood proud with its weathered wooden frame and hand-painted sign depicting the delicate wings of a swallow. Elara, known for her meticulous craftsmanship and kind heart, held her clientele in high regard. From noble ladies seeking corseted gowns to blacksmiths needing sturdy aprons, she adorned them all with her unique creations.  

But today was different. Today, a strange unease coiled in Elara's stomach as she looked at the new order sitting on her table: a simple tunic for a young soldier named Finn. The fabric felt stiff and unnatural, an unsettling texture against her hand. As she began to measure it, a faint hum emanated from within the fabric, vibrating against her fingertips like tiny unseen tremors. Elara felt an icy shiver crawl down her spine, a premonition of something far more profound than just a new client's request.
