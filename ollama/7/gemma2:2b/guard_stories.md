The humid air hung heavy in the courtyard, thick with the scent of brine and decaying fish.  Even at dawn, it felt like walking through a living furnace, sweat stinging Silas's eyes as he patrolled the outer perimeter of The Citadel. His tunic, once the pristine white of an angel's robe, was now stained with an oily grime that only years of watching over these volatile waters could produce. 

His name was Silas Stoneworth, and for fifteen years, his duty had been to guard the gates of this crumbling city-state nestled on a rocky outcrop in the middle of the unforgiving Azure Sea. The Citadel housed the last remnants of an ancient civilization, their descendants clinging to the fading echoes of magic that once powered the world's most vibrant cities. Now, they only served as a fragile refuge against the endless waves and more insidious enemies: the Factions.

Silas tightened his grip on the rusted steel bars he used for leverage when needed. He’d seen plenty of things in his time – brawls between families vying for power, petty theft, even the occasional kraken attack that sent the docks into a chaotic frenzy. But today felt different. There was an undercurrent to this day, something he couldn't quite place, leaving his gut feeling like it was full of lead.
