The scent of stale coffee clung to Mrs. Evelyn Hawthorne's classroom like a tired ghost.  The late October air in Willow Creek High was crisp and biting, sending chills down even the thickest sweaters. Outside, leaves whirled in a frantic dance around the library windows, mimicking the erratic beats of her heart as she stared at the stack of disciplinary letters on her desk. 

Evelyn Hawthorne, with her unruly silver hair pulled back into a tight bun and her ever-present lavender-scented hand lotion, was no stranger to conflict.  But this time it felt different, like a storm brewing in the otherwise peaceful life that seemed so perfectly curated for her. She took a deep breath, trying to steady her nervous tremors as she picked up a letter, addressed in an unfamiliar spidery handwriting. 

Willow Creek High's hallowed halls echoed with gossip and whispered rumours.  They had begun circulating about Mrs. Hawthorne's recent decision to allow a student named Amelia Thorne to join the school newspaper. A move that was seen by some as a progressive act of inclusivity, while others saw it as a reckless gamble against the traditional boundaries of their town.
