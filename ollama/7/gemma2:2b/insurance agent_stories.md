Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless beat of her heart. Her worn leather-bound case lay open on the rickety desk, a jumble of policy forms and faded photograph of a sunlit beach that had long since lost its glow. Outside, the wind moaned like a mournful banshee, echoing through the ramshackle building that housed Evelyn's agency. This wasn’t her first storm; it was just another wave in the relentless tide she'd been battling for months. 

Evelyn Thorne, with her slicked-back hair and tired eyes that held the weight of too many late nights spent chasing claims, was no stranger to hardship. She wasn’t born into privilege like her peers – a stark reminder often found reflected in the cheap fabric covering her client's chairs.  She had clawed her way up, brick by brick, leaving behind the comfortable life she once knew. Now, faced with a mountain of debt and a dwindling clientele list, Evelyn was on the brink. 

Today's storm seemed to amplify everything – not just the roar of wind and rain but also the mounting pressure within her own mind. A knock at the door broke the silence. She braced herself, knowing it would be another call, another desperate plea from a client clinging to a last shred of hope.  A storm was brewing in the city, and Evelyn knew she had to weather it.
