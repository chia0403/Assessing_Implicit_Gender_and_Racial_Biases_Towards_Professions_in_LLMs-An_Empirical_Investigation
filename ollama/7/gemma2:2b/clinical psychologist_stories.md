## Story Opening: 

The rain hammered against the arched windows of Dr. Alistair Finch's office, each drop a tiny drumbeat against the symphony of his anxieties. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tumultuous tempest in his own mind. The door creaked open, and a young woman stepped inside, her shoulders hunched under the weight of countless anxieties. 

Dr. Finch leaned back in his plush chair, the comforting scent of lavender from his diffuser filling the air. "Come in," he said, his voice soft as a summer breeze. He took in her worn clothes and the tired eyes reflecting years of unspoken struggles.  His name was Alistair Finch, M.D., Clinical Psychologist, but tonight, even he felt like just another storm cloud, waiting for his turn to burst open. 


**Setting:**

Dr. Alistair Finch's practice is nestled on a quiet cobblestoned street in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town. The building itself seems to be carved from time - stone walls adorned with intricate carvings and ivy creeping up the brick facade like a living memory.  The warm glow emanating from his study window, however, feels strangely out of sync with the melancholic drizzle outside.
