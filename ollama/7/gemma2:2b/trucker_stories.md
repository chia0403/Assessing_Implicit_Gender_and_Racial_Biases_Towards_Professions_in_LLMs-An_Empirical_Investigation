The desert wind whipped dust devils across Route 66, swirling the red sand into miniature tornadoes that danced just beyond the cracked asphalt.  It was like an old man's wrinkles, etched into the earth itself. Beneath the relentless sun,  **Bartholomew "Barty" Jenkins**, his weathered face masked by a faded trucker hat pulled low over his brow, hunched deeper in his cab of his trusty eighteen-wheeler. The engine hummed with a low, familiar drone, a lullaby to Barty's weary soul. He was hauling another load of lumber from Phoenix to the bustling city of Chicago, his routes carved into his very being by years of dusty miles and indifferent stars. 

Bartyâ€™s truck was more than just a vehicle; it was his partner, his confidant, and, in its own way, a sanctuary against the vast emptiness he often felt inside.  The worn leather seat, scarred with countless journeys, had become as familiar as his own hand. The old radio crackled to life, spitting out static and faded country tunes as Barty flipped through the channels, trying in vain to find anything other than a drone-like symphony of silence punctuated by mechanical groans.
