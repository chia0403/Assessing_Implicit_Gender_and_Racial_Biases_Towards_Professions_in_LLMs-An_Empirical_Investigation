The rain hammered against the corrugated roof of Mrs. Evelyn Sinclair's office, mimicking the rhythm of her own anxious heart.  She was waiting for another "problem" to drop from the sky, another adolescent storm to ride out with a gentle hand and some well-chosen words of wisdom. But today, it wasn’t a student or a parent in need. It was the air itself that felt thick with potential chaos.

This morning had begun like any other - a cacophony of student anxieties bubbling to the surface during her morning meetings. The usual suspects were present: a boy on the verge of expulsion for "misbehavior" (Evelyn's word, not her own), a girl struggling with self-doubt about college applications (a subject she found herself increasingly drawn to as time passed), and a nervous young man caught between ambition and his father's expectations.  But this morning felt different. The air crackled with a strange tension - Evelyn could feel it in the hushed whispers of her staff room, in the way students’ eyes darted nervously from face to face. 

The only person who seemed calm was Mr. Davies, the school principal, whose smile seemed wider than usual, as if he were waiting for something to happen.  Evelyn knew he had his own reasons for being so cheerful, but she was not convinced. She'd seen enough of this life in her thirty years as a guidance counselor to know that even the calmest storm could brew itself into something far more devastating. 

And today, perhaps, it was about to start. Her name was Evelyn Thorne, and she would be navigating the minefield for another day.
