Rain splattered against the shop windows like angry coins, each drop resonating with the incessant rhythm of the nearby city traffic. Inside "Pretty Hands," Amelia Thorne meticulously filed Mrs. Henderson's nails down to a fine sheen.  The once-bright pink nail polish had dulled under weeks of wear and tear, its surface marred by the tiny chipped flakes that clung to them like forgotten promises. 

Amelia sighed, her gaze lingering on Mrs. Henderson's wrinkled hands as she gently stroked the worn fabric of her dress. "Just a bit more," Amelia murmured, using her signature quick-acting remover to ensure the color wouldn't seep into the soft flesh beneath.  She was always meticulous, even in her downtime, taking pride in every detail.

The air, thick with the scent of acetone and lavender nail polish remover, felt suffocating, even through the thin, dust-muffled ventilation system. Amelia couldn't help but feel restless. The rain continued its relentless assault on the world outside, mirroring the turmoil she saw reflected in Mrs. Henderson’s eyes.  

The usual calming hum of customers chatting about life and their day was absent today. It was as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen before bursting into a cacophony of noise. Amelia closed her eyes, trying to find peace amidst the storm brewing within her own soul. The clock ticked relentlessly, a stark reminder that time was slipping through her fingers like the last few grains of sand on a deserted beach.  

Her name was Amelia Thorne, but for now, she felt lost in the swirling chaos of it all – just another nail technician in a city that seemed to have forgotten its rhythm.
