## The Dust Devils

**Opening:** The sun beat down on Jericho Cross's weathered face like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he wrestled with the massive bulldozer, its metal maw spitting dirt and smoke across the desolate landscape of the abandoned mine site. 
 
**Setting:**  The vast emptiness of Arizona's Mojave Desert stretches before him, dotted only by the skeletal remains of towering mining shafts and dust devils swirling in the dry heat. Years ago, this land had been alive with activity â€“ a bustling, gritty metropolis of men and machines working to extract precious minerals from the earth's belly. Now, it was just another victim of progress, left to decay under the relentless glare of the desert sun. 

**Character:** Jericho Cross.  A man built like an oak tree - broad shoulders, calloused hands, and a face etched with both weariness and stubborn determination. He wasn't a young man, but his hands still held that raw skill, a familiarity with heavy machinery born from years of experience beneath the unforgiving Arizona sun. He was their last connection to a bygone era, a silent guardian of the past as he drove, repaired, and fought against the relentless desert wind on its behalf.
