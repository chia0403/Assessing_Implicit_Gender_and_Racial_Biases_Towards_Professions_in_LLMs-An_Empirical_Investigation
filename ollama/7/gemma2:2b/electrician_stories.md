## The Flickering Flame

**Setting:**  The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shack, each drop like a tiny drumbeat on the worn wooden planks below. The old porch light cast wavering shadows across the dust-covered floorboards, revealing only a fragment of the dilapidated interior. 

**Character:** Edward "Eddy" Finch, his calloused hands gripping the worn leather toolbox tighter as he surveyed the ramshackle structure before him.  His weathered face, framed by thick greying hair, was etched with years of working in the shadows, sweat and grime clinging to his worn-out shirt and tool belt.  For Eddy, every spark was a battle won, every faulty circuit a puzzle to solve. He wasn't just an electrician; he was a master of the unseen, a conjurer of light and life within the often-hushed corners of this world.

"Right then," Eddy muttered, wiping his brow with the back of his hand.  The air hung thick with the smell of damp wood and old wiring. The flickering flame of a lone oil lamp cast an erratic dance across his face, its wavering light illuminating the lines etched upon his weathered skin. The storm outside raged on, mirroring the turmoil brewing within him - the fear for the family who depended on this ramshackle structure, the gnawing worry that he might be losing control of his own life as easily as he could turn a light switch off and on. 


What would Eddy do next?
