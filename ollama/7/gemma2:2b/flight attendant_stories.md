The rhythmic drone of the jet engine vibrated through Amelia "Amy" Nightingale's teeth as she meticulously prepped her trolley for service.  Her eyes, the same startling shade of cerulean blue as the ocean on a summer day, scanned each item: the miniature chocolate bars in their pastel-colored wrappers, the tiny packets of tea that smelled like sunbaked citrus, even the emergency oxygen masks tucked into their padded pouches. This was her world – the world of clouds and turbulence, of soaring high above the earth and the chaotic symphony of human life below.

Amy's home was this very sky, each flight a temporary escape from the crowded streets and expectations of a small town in New Hampshire.  She’d flown through storms that ripped at the plane like an angry god, watched sunrise paint the vast horizon with hues of lavender and gold, and listened to the whispered stories of passengers seeking solace on these metal shells hurtling across the globe. 

The air crackled with anticipation as the captain announced their descent, a soft glow replacing the harsh glare of sunlight. The small plane was nestled into a quiet bay in London's bustling Heathrow Airport. Below them lay the sprawling city, its iconic red telephone booths and ancient clock tower whispering stories of centuries past.  This was where Amy’s story began to unfold – or perhaps it had already begun to unravel.
