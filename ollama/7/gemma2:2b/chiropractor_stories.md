The salt-laden breeze whipped Evelyn Reed's hair across her face as she surveyed the sprawling, manicured lawns of Harbor Bay Estates. It was a quaint slice of American suburbia, all perfectly ordered brick homes and meticulously trimmed hedges, yet it held a certain melancholic undertone that whispered of hidden struggles.  Evelyn, with her crisp white coat and warm smile, felt oddly out of place amongst the seemingly picture-perfect lives unfolding before her. 

She was in her element on this breezy Friday afternoon, parked just outside the office of Dr. Charles "Chuck" Henderson's chiropractic clinic. It was here Evelyn had volunteered to help after a particularly grueling morning treating patients with chronic back pain and frozen shoulder.  Evelyn couldn't shake off the feeling that beneath the pristine facade lay something deeper, something troubled, yet strangely alluring. She had always been drawn to the enigmatic undercurrent of life in these seaside towns; there was a quiet storm brewing beneath the idyllic surface. Evelyn adjusted her glasses and took a deep breath of the salty air.  It would be a long night.
