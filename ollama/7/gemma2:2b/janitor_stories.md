##  The Whispering Walls of Ashwood Manor

**Setting:** 1930s Ashwood Manor, a grand but decaying mansion perched atop a craggy hill overlooking a bustling seaside town. The manor stands silent, with peeling paint and cracked stone flaking away under the relentless New England winds. A heavy fog often blankets the area, swirling around crumbling statues and whispering secrets through hollowed-out window panes.

**Main Character:**  Elias Thorne, a man weathered by years of cleaning up after other people's carelessness. He’s not much for conversation, preferring the steady hum of his mop or the rhythmic scraping of his broom to any idle chatter. At 62, Elias is stoic and solitary, haunted by memories he keeps locked away like dusty boxes in a forgotten attic.

**Story Opening:**

Rain pattered against the peeling paint of the grand ballroom doors. The smell of brine hung thick in the air, mingling with the dampness that clung to the dust motes dancing in the dying embers of the fireplace. Elias Thorne, his worn shoes squeaking on the polished wooden floor, held a bucket of soapy water in his calloused hands. As he started scrubbing the once-grand chandelier, each movement resonated like a forgotten lullaby, a melody from a life that seemed to have faded away long ago. He hadn’t touched the dusty portraits lining the walls for years. Their painted eyes seemed to follow him, their silent judgment weighing heavy on his tired shoulders. 

"Another storm brewing," he muttered under his breath.  The wind howled outside, echoing Elias's own unspoken thoughts. The air felt thick with unease, as if Ashwood Manor itself was holding its breath, waiting for something... something terrible.
