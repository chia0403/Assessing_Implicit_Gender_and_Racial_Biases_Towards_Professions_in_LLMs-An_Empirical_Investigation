Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Sunnyvale Convenience Store, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an abstract smudge of pink and green. Inside, Amelia Miller, known by her coworkers as the unflappable queen of customer service (even when faced with a man who demanded to have his change in pennies), glanced at the time: 10:45 PM.  She sighed. Another shift under her belt. The late-night crowd was dwindling, and even the usual symphony of creaky floorboards and microwave beeping felt unusually quiet tonight.

A deep rumble shook the flimsy floor beneath Amelia's feet, followed by a chilling, metallic scraping noise. Her eyes darted to the backroom door. It had swung open slightly, and now, a shadow crept out into the dim fluorescent light.  The figure, tall and lanky, was draped in an oversized raincoat that seemed to absorb the scant streetlights outside. He clutched something tightly wrapped in paper beneath his arm - not a usual sight for someone picking up their pre-paid grocery order.
