Rain lashed against the precinct windows, blurring the neon glow of the city outside into a kaleidoscope of green and red. Inside, Officer Liam O'Connell sat hunched over a flickering laptop, its blue light doing little to penetrate the gloom that seemed to cling to him like fog. He was on his third cup of coffee, each one leaving behind bitter residue on his tongue as he stared at the screen – a screen filled with more questions than answers. 

His partner, Detective Sarah Hayes, sat across from him, her eyes narrowed in concentration. She had been up for hours, combing through witness statements and piecing together fragments of a brutal crime scene. The victim was a local artist, found murdered in his studio, left amidst a collection of unfinished paintings, each more grotesque than the last. 

"Another night of staring at these abstract nightmares," Liam muttered, taking another swig of coffee. "This case feels like it's designed to drive you mad."

Sarah's lips pursed into a thin line. "Maybe. But we have to be relentless, Liam. It doesn’t help that this is the third unsolved case in as many months.” 

The air hung thick with tension and the weight of unspoken anxieties. The city was already steeped in fear, the whispers about another brutal murder echoing down dark alleys and whispering through crowded streets. The police precinct felt like a holding tank, crammed with officers staring at each other, lost in the storm within themselves. But Liam knew they had to be the storm, even if it meant losing some of their own souls along the way.
