The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Mrs. Eleanor Beaumont's cluttered desk. Papers, filled with half-formed scribbles and anxieties she couldn't decipher, overflowed from the in tray. A sticky note adorned with a rainbow unicorn clung precariously to a file labeled "Jason Thompson - College Applications." 

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of grey hair behind her ear. Her office at Willow Creek High wasn't exactly what one would call inspiring. Beige walls and worn-out furniture did little to alleviate the pressure that came with guiding the next generation through their often turbulent teenage years.  But there was a certain rhythm to it all, a bittersweet symphony of adolescent angst and burgeoning hope that Eleanor found strangely comforting. Today, however, the music felt off-key. A sense of unease, like a premonition, hung heavy in the air. 


Eleanor had a feeling this wasn't going to be just another ordinary day at Willow Creek High.
