The flickering neon sign above Benny "Sparks" Delacroix's workshop cast an erratic glow across his grease-stained overalls and the tangle of wires spilling from a toolbox on the workbench. The humid Louisiana air hung heavy outside, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain.  Benny squinted at the wiring diagram in his calloused hands, its edges softened by years of use. A worn baseball cap, perched precariously on his head, shielded his eyes from the harsh glare of the single bare bulb illuminating the workshop.

This wasn't Benny's first rodeo, but this job was proving to be a real humdinger â€“ a vintage jukebox malfunctioning in the back room of "The Blue Moon," a bar that had seen more than its fair share of good times and bad. And with the local karaoke night just hours away, Benny knew he was on borrowed time. The clock ticked ominously on the wall, each second a reminder that the fate of a dozen hopeful crooners rested on his ability to fix this temperamental machine.
