The acrid smell of smoke hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that never truly faded for Elias "Eli" Blackwood. His boots crunched on the gravel driveway as he approached Engine 23, his weathered face illuminated by the flashing crimson and blue lights of the responding ambulance. The dispatch call had come in twenty minutes ago: residential fire, possible entrapment.

Eli lived and breathed this small, coastal town named Oakhaven. He knew its winding streets like the back of his hand, and he knew the families who resided within those homes. His gut twisted with dread as he envisioned flames consuming a life he might have once shared a friendly wave with at the grocery store.  

The engine roared to life, a metallic growl that resonated through Eli's bones. He clambered inside, his eyes meeting the worried gaze of his partner, Sarah Thompson. 

"Anything on their end?" he asked, tightening his helmet strap.

Sarah shook her head, her face pale. "Just confirmation - house fire, possible child trapped."  


**Setting:** Oakhaven, a sleepy coastal town nestled between rolling hills and the crashing Atlantic waves. The houses are mostly charming two-story homes built of weathered wood, with picket fences lining the streets and vibrant gardens blooming in every yard. The air is thick with the smell of salt and pine, and the constant rhythm of seagulls crying provides a melancholic soundtrack to daily life.
