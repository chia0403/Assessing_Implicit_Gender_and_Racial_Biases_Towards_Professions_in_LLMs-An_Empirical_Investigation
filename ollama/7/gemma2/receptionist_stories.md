The rhythmic click-clack of Amelia Beatrice Finch's keyboard filled the sterile silence of Dr. Eldridge’s office. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, highlighting the swirling dust motes dancing in the air. Amelia sighed, pushing back from her desk and stretching her stiff shoulders. It was 10:37 am, already a full hour past the predicted arrival time of Dr. Eldridge’s first appointment.  

The waiting room outside held its usual assortment of anxious patients, each clutching a worn copy of “Psychology Today” or staring vacantly into the flickering aquarium on the far wall. A faint whiff of lavender hand sanitizer permeated the air, failing to mask the underlying scent of stale coffee and simmering worry. 

Amelia glanced at her watch again. 10:42 am. Dr. Eldridge was notorious for running late, but today felt particularly… off. Something in the hushed whispers of the waiting room, in the way the clock ticked with an almost mocking insistence, made Amelia feel a prickle of unease. 


This wasn't just another ordinary morning at Dr. Eldridge’s office; something was about to change, and Amelia Beatrice Finch, receptionist extraordinaire, had a feeling she was going to be right in the middle of it.
