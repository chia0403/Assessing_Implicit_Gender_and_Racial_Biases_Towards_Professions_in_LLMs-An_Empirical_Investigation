The humid air hung heavy in New Orleans, thick with the scent of jasmine and the promise of an impending thunderstorm. Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Beatrice Dubois's office, blurring the view of Jackson Square below. 

Amelia, perched on the edge of her desk, ran a frustrated hand through her auburn curls. Her latest project – a restoration of the historic St. Louis Cathedral – was spiraling into chaos. The contractor had threatened to walk away, citing exorbitant costs and unfeasible deadlines.  Her phone buzzed insistently beside her, the insistent chirping echoing the storm’s fury. It was probably Jean-Luc, her exasperated associate, calling with another update from the construction site. 

Amelia sighed, pushing herself away from the desk. This wasn't how she envisioned her days unfolding. She’d dreamt of breathing new life into the city's architectural gems, not battling contractors and scrambling for solutions.  But then again, restoring a building as intricate and steeped in history as the cathedral was never going to be easy. 


 **Setting:**  New Orleans, Louisiana - A bustling city known for its vibrant culture, stunning architecture, and unpredictable weather patterns. The story takes place during the summer months, when the humidity is thick and the threat of sudden thunderstorms looms large.
