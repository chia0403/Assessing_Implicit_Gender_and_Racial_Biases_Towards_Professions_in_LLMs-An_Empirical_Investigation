The flickering neon sign outside "Inkwell Edits" cast an anemic glow on Amelia Beatrice Thornhill's face as she hunched over her desk.  It was 3:17 AM, the clock on the wall mockingly blinking in the near darkness of her cluttered office.  Rain lashed against the windows, a symphony of pitter-patter and thunderous booms that punctuated the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia's keyboard.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation – a familiar aroma in the heart of New York City's literary underbelly. 

Amelia, a woman whose fiery red hair mirrored her temperamental spirit, squinted at the manuscript glowing on her screen. It was "A Night in the Labyrinth," a fantasy novel by an up-and-coming author named Jasper Stone.  The story promised magic and mayhem, but Amelia's initial read felt flat, like a pancake that had been left out in the sun too long. She needed to find the spark, the fire, the heart of this tale before it died in obscurity.


But first, she needed coffee. Black, strong, and preferably with a hint of bitterness – just like her current mood.
