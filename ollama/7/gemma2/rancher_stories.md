The sun, already a searing eye in the sky by six in the morning, baked the dusty earth of the Red Rock Ranch.  Caylee Beaumont squinted against its glare as she surveyed her herd grazing in the distance, a sea of brown and white speckled across the parched landscape. The air hung heavy with the scent of sagebrush and sweat, a familiar aroma that clung to Caylee like a second skin. 

Caylee was built for this harsh beauty – strong arms honed by years of mending fences and wrangling strays, tanned skin weathered by countless sunrises, her blonde hair usually pulled back in a tight braid, escaping occasionally in wisps around her freckled face.  At twenty-five, she was the heart and soul of Red Rock Ranch, running it with a fierce independence that had been instilled in her by her late father. The ranch wasn't just her livelihood; it was her legacy, her connection to the land that had cradled generations of Beaumonts before her. 


But today, the usual rhythm of life felt different.  A knot of unease tightened in Caylee's stomach. A raven circled above the herd, its harsh croak echoing through the stillness – a bad omen, everyone on Red Rock Ranch knew. And the silence itself seemed too profound, broken only by the distant bleating of sheep from the neighboring Miller property. Something was amiss, something that had yet to reveal itself. Caylee felt it in her bones, a premonition as tangible as the heat radiating off the dusty ground beneath her boots.
