The air in "Chez Moi" hung thick with the scent of garlic, sizzling butter, and desperation.  Eloise Beaumont weaved between tables, balancing a precarious stack of plates like a seasoned tightrope walker. The late-Friday rush was in full swing, the once cozy restaurant transformed into a cacophony of clinking glasses, boisterous laughter, and impatient sighs. Eloise, her name tag askew, forced a smile at a grumpy businessman who complained about his lukewarm soup, then hustled to refill water glasses before anyone noticed the growing puddle under table six.  It was another night in paradise, if you were into the kind of paradise where burnt risotto and broken dreams went hand-in-hand. 


Outside, the Parisian skyline glittered with an almost mocking beauty – a symphony of twinkling lights that seemed worlds away from the greasy apron Eloise wore and the simmering resentment she felt towards Monsieur Dubois, the surly owner who treated his staff like disposable napkins. But tonight, something was different. A prickle of anticipation buzzed beneath Eloise's skin, fueled by an unknown force.  Maybe it was the new scent wafting from the kitchen – a hint of lavender and rosemary that promised something more than just another tired menu. Or perhaps, just perhaps, it was the way the dim lights seemed to dance around a man in a dark coat, who had just slipped into the corner booth, his face shrouded in shadow.
