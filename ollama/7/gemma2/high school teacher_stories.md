The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a discordant tune as Amelia Juniper-Rose surveyed her classroom.  Stacks of crumpled essays on "The Great Gatsby" lay like fallen soldiers on every desk, their once vibrant green ink now dulled with the weight of teenage indifference.  

Amelia sighed, running a hand through her unruly auburn curls. She wasn't sure what had happened to her students this year. Maybe it was the constant stream of standardized tests and college application stress that choked the joy out of learning, or perhaps she'd simply grown too accustomed to their jaded expressions. 

The bell shrieked, jolting her from her melancholy.  A horde of restless teenagers poured in, their faces a blur of bored indifference and half-hearted greetings. Amelia forced a smile, wishing for a spark of genuine interest, a flicker of that intellectual curiosity that had first drawn her to teaching.


**Setting:**

* A dimly lit high school English classroom in late autumn
* Desks cluttered with student work and forgotten lunches 
* The air thick with the scent of stale coffee and adolescent angst
