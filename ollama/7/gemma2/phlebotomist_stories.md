The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Cartwright’s head, their pale glow washing over the worn linoleum floor of the blood draw station. The antiseptic smell hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of coffee from the break room down the hall. Amelia glanced at the clock: 10:37 AM.  Another Wednesday morning in Harmony Healthcare’s bustling outpatient clinic, where her days were a symphony of prickles and vials.  

She watched as Mrs. Peterson, a woman whose face was creased with worry lines deeper than the valleys carved by time, shuffled towards her station. Amelia pasted on her reassuring smile – the one that said "you're in good hands" even when she felt anything but. Today, it seemed, anxiety hummed in the air as thick as the antiseptic.  Amelia braced herself for whatever story Mrs. Peterson’s drawn blood might tell.
