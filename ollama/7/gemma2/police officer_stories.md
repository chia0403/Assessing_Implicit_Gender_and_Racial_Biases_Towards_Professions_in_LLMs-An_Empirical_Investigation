Rain lashed against Detective Isabella 'Izzy' Diaz's trench coat as she surveyed the scene.  The alley reeked of damp garbage and something else, something acrid and metallic that made her nose wrinkle. Neon lights from a nearby ramen shop cast long, distorted shadows across the slick cobblestones, turning the already gloomy alley into a canvas of shifting hues. A cluster of police officers huddled around the body, their faces obscured by the downpour. Izzy pushed past them, her boots splashing through puddles that mirrored the city's tired skyline above.  

The victim was sprawled on his back, a pool of crimson blooming around him like a macabre flower. He wore a worn leather jacket and faded jeans, his face pale and slack in death. A single crimson rose lay next to his hand, its petals glistening with rain. This wasn't the first time Izzy had seen this kind of grim tableau, but something about the scene felt different, unsettlingly familiar.  A shiver ran down her spine, a prickle of unease that whispered of danger yet to come. 


**Setting:**

A rainy night in the Backstreets District of New Zenith City, a bustling metropolis known for its vibrant nightlife and hidden underbelly. The Backstreets are a maze of narrow alleys, dimly lit by flickering streetlights and neon signs advertising everything from ramen shops to illegal gambling dens.
