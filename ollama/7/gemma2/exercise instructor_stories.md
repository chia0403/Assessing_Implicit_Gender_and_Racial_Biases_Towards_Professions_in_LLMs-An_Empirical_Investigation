The air hung thick with the scent of sweat and eucalyptus oil in the dimly lit Spin Studio. Neon lights pulsed in time with the throbbing techno music, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the glistening bodies pushing themselves to the limit.  Amelia "Ace" Everly, her bright pink hair a beacon against the black walls, stood poised before the spinning bikes like a conductor leading an orchestra of exertion. Her voice, crisp and commanding, cut through the thumping bass as she directed the next burst of pedal power.

"Fifteen more seconds, people! Feel the burn! Push through that lactic acid! You've got this!" Ace yelled, her own legs churning furiously on her stationary bike, a testament to her unwavering commitment to pushing past physical limits.  She was their leader, their motivator, the woman who could coax even the most reluctant participant into finding a hidden reservoir of strength. But tonight, as she glanced around at the familiar faces in front of her, Ace couldn't shake a feeling of unease. Something felt different.  Somethingâ€¦off. 


The setting is:

* **Spin Studio:** A high-intensity workout facility specializing in indoor cycling classes, complete with spinning bikes, dimmed lights, and pulsating music.
* **Time:** Nighttime, during a particularly grueling spin class.
