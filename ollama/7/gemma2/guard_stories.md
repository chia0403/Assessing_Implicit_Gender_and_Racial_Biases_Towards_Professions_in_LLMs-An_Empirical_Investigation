The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, carrying with it the scent of snow and despair.  Sergeant Elara Valerius pulled her worn fur cloak tighter around herself, her breath misting in the frigid air. The watchtower loomed above her, its stone walls scarred by countless storms and a few too many skirmishes with the raiders that plagued the Southern March. Below, the expanse stretched out, a canvas of endless grey under a sky choked with storm clouds. 

Elara squinted, searching the horizon for any sign of movement. Her duty was to protect this border outpost â€“ the last line of defense between the civilized city of Aethelgard and the wild, untamed lands beyond. It was a lonely existence, but Elara found solace in its quiet routine: the methodical pacing, the vigilant scanning of the landscape, the reassuring weight of her sword at her hip. 


But tonight felt different.  A disquiet hummed beneath the surface of the wind, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that warned of something amiss. Something was coming. And Elara knew, with a certainty that chilled her more than the bitter cold, that it wasn't the familiar silhouette of a raiding party.
