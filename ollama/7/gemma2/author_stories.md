The biting wind whipped Amelia Beatrice Finch's auburn braid across her face as she trudged up the steep path to her secluded cottage. The November sky was the colour of bruised plums, threatening rain that would only further muddy the already treacherous track.  Amelia pulled her woolen scarf tighter, burying her nose in its comforting warmth.

Her cottage, nestled amidst the craggy hills of the Scottish Highlands, was a haven from the world. It was here, surrounded by the murmuring pines and the endless expanse of the moors, that Amelia found solace and inspiration for her writing. But lately, the silence had felt oppressive, the inspiration elusive. The words refused to come, leaving her feeling like a hollowed-out shell of the passionate storyteller she once was.  

Today, however, felt different. A strange restlessness pulsed within her, urging her forward. Perhaps, Amelia mused, the very storm brewing outside mirrored the turmoil within her, and perhaps this tempest would finally unlock the secrets her mind held captive.
