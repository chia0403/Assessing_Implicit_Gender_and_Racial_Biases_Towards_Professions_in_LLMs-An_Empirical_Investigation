The flickering neon sign cast an electric blue glow across Elias Finch's weary face. He squinted at the code scrolling down his screen, each line a tiny battle against the digital gremlins that plagued his project. The air in the cramped apartment was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the city of Neo-Kyoto hummed with life, a symphony of neon, holographic advertisements, and the distant whine of flying vehicles. But Elias felt worlds away, trapped in a pixelated purgatory of his own making. He needed this program to work. It was more than just another gig; it was his ticket out of this cramped apartment, out of debt, and maybe even... out of himself. 


He took a swig of lukewarm coffee, the bitter taste doing little to jolt him awake.  Elias adjusted his glasses, pushing them further up his nose. He needed focus. Needed a solution. Neededâ€¦a miracle.
