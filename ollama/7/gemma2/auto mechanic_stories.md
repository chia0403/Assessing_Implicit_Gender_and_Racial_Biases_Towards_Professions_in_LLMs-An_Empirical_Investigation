The air hung thick with the smell of gasoline and burnt oil, a scent Amelia "Amy" Petrova found comforting rather than repulsive.  Grease smeared her knuckles, and her hair, usually pulled back in a tight braid, was escaping its confines, wisps framing her face like rebellious tendrils. She squinted at the engine block before her, a symphony of metal and wires that she understood better than any human language. 

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across Petrova's Auto Repair, a small, unassuming building tucked away on a dusty side street in Amarillo, Texas. The neon sign above flickered erratically, barely illuminating the worn tire racks and overflowing toolboxes scattered around the shop. Amy sighed, wiping her brow with the back of her hand. This was going to be a long night.
