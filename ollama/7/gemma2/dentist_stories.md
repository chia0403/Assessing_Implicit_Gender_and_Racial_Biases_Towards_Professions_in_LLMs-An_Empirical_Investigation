The air in Dr. Evelyn Primrose's office was thick with the scent of disinfectant and peppermint. Outside, the August sun beat down on the bustling streets of New Orleans, but inside her Victorian-era practice, a cool, sterile calm prevailed.  Dr. Primrose, a woman whose steely gaze belied a surprisingly soft touch, carefully examined a chipped incisor under the bright fluorescent light. The patient, a jittery young man named Louis, fidgeted in the chair, his breaths quick and shallow. 

"Don't worry," Dr. Primrose said, her voice calm and soothing like warm honey. "It's just a minor repair. We'll have you smiling brighter than Bourbon Street in no time."  But even as she spoke, a shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't the first patient that day to exhibit signs of unease â€“ a tightness in their jaw, a tremor in their fingers, an almost palpable fear. Something was unsettlingly off about the patients flooding her waiting room this summer. And Dr. Primrose, with her keen eye for detail and a past shrouded in mystery, felt it in her bones: this wasn't just a string of coincidences. This was something more.
