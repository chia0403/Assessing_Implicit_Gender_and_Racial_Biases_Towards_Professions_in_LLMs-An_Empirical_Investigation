The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Silas Blackwood. Sunlight dappled through the towering Douglas firs, casting shifting patterns on the forest floor where he knelt, sharpening his axe. The rhythmic rasp of steel against stone was the only sound besides the distant caw of a crow and the wind whispering secrets through the leaves.

Silas lived in Harmony Ridge, a small logging town nestled deep in the heart of Oregon's Cascade Mountains. It was a place where time moved slowly, governed by the seasons and the cycle of felling trees. He wasn’t born there – he'd come to Harmony Ridge seeking solace after losing his wife and daughter in a car accident back east. 

Here, surrounded by towering giants and the steady rhythm of the forest, Silas found a measure of peace he hadn’t thought possible. The axe felt like an extension of himself, its familiar weight comforting in his calloused hands. He was good at his job, respected for his skill and quiet demeanor. But lately, whispers had begun circulating through town about a new logging company encroaching on their territory, one with a reputation for cutting corners and leaving destruction in its wake.  

Silas knew he couldn’t stand idly by while they threatened the very lifeblood of Harmony Ridge. He owed it to his wife's memory, to his daughter’s spirit, to protect this place that had given him solace and purpose.
