The asphalt shingles groaned under Elias Bartholomew's boots as he carefully maneuvered across the sloping roof. A symphony of city sounds—car horns blaring, sirens wailing, laughter spilling from open windows—rose up from the street below, but for Elias, it was all white noise. He focused on the task at hand: replacing a section of rotted shingles before another thunderstorm rolled in, threatening to turn his work into a dangerous dance with gravity and precipitation.

The building he was working on was an old Victorian townhouse, its red brick facade worn smooth by time and weather. The smell of damp wood and decaying leaves hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of roofing tar. Elias wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, the midday sun beating down mercilessly even through the thin canvas of his work shirt. He squinted at the horizon, where storm clouds were gathering like bruised plums, casting long shadows across the city below. 


Elias Bartholomew was a man who lived in the spaces between buildings, both literally and figuratively.  He knew these roofs like the back of his hand, each crack, each dip, each loose shingle telling a story of weather, neglect, and time's relentless passage. He wasn't just fixing roofs; he was patching up pieces of the city itself.
