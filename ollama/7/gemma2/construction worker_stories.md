The sunrise bled over the horizon like a ruptured artery, staining the steel beams of the half-built skyscraper with hues of bruised purple and angry orange. The air hung thick with the scent of sweat, exhaust fumes, and freshly poured concrete, a perfume unique to this sprawling metropolis on the edge of chaos. 

Elias Thorne whistled along to the tinny music blasting from his battered walkman, each beat mirroring the rhythmic clang of his hammer against the rebar. He was a man forged in the crucible of this city, his hands calloused and strong, his face weathered by years under the unforgiving sun. At 34, Elias had known nothing but the dizzying heights and unforgiving ground of construction, his life measured in steel girders and concrete slabs. 


Today, however, felt different. A prickling sensation ran down his spine, a disquiet that whispered of change on the wind. Perhaps it was the way the shadows seemed deeper than usual, or the unsettling stillness before the city's roar would begin. Whatever it was, Elias couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous was about to happen.
