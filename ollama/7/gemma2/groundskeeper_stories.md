Bartholomew, or Bart as he was known by the few souls who dared venture into the sprawling botanical gardens behind St. Sybil's Cathedral, was the sole custodian of this verdant sanctuary. Rows upon rows of vibrant orchids, their blooms heavy with dew, stretched towards the pale morning sky. Towering palms whispered secrets in the breeze, their fronds rustling like ancient prophecies. The air hummed with the drone of unseen bees, their tiny bodies tireless workers in a grand symphony of life. 

Bart, his gnarled hands gripping a pair of shears, inhaled deeply. This was his solace, this hidden world of whispering leaves and fragrant blooms, a refuge from the bustling city beyond the cathedral walls. It was also, Bart suspected, on the brink of something extraordinary. He had felt it in the air for weeks – a shift, a tremor beneath the surface of this familiar beauty. 


The sun, finally breaking free from behind the retreating clouds, cast long shadows across the manicured lawns.  Bart straightened, his weathered face creased with curiosity. Today, he knew, would be different.
