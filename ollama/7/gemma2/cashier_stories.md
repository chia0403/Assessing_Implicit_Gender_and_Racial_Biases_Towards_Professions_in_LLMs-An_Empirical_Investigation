The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Clementine's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of brightly packaged goods. She surveyed her kingdom – the checkout counter at "Bargain Bin Bonanza," a discount store known more for its chipped ceramic mugs and dusty board games than for customer service. The air was thick with the scent of stale popcorn and bleach, punctuated by the occasional squawk from a disgruntled pigeon trapped in the ventilation shaft.

Amelia sighed, adjusting her nametag – the plastic had started to peel at the edges – and scanned another bag of generic pretzels. She'd been working here for three years, ever since she graduated high school with a degree in Creative Writing that felt more like a novelty than a qualification.  Her dreams of publishing poetry anthologies seemed as distant now as the stars twinkling through the grimy windowpane.  

Instead, Amelia found herself living out her days amidst bargain-hunting moms, grumpy retirees, and the occasional teenager who thought it was funny to steal candy bars and run for the exit.  She longed for a spark of excitement, a break in the monotonous routine. 


What could possibly disrupt this mundane world?
