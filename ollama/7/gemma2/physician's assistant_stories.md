The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. Amelia Blythe-Harper, her starched white coat gleaming under the fluorescent lights, knelt beside the gurney, her brow furrowed in concentration. The emergency room at St. Jude's Hospital in rural Montana was a whirlwind of activity; nurses barked orders into clipped radios, paramedics rushed patients through double doors, and the constant hum of machinery throbbed like a restless heartbeat. 

Amelia, despite years of experience as a physician's assistant, felt a familiar knot tightening in her stomach. This wasn't just another shift, another case. The boy on the gurney, barely twelve years old, was unconscious, his chest rising and falling with shallow breaths. A frantic-eyed woman knelt beside him, her hand clutching his cold one, whispering silent pleas into his ear. 

This small town, nestled in a valley surrounded by snow-capped peaks, rarely saw cases like this.  The nearest trauma center was hours away, a fact that pressed down on Amelia's chest like a lead weight. This boy needed help, and she had to be the one to give it to him.
