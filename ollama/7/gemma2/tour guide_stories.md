The midday sun beat down on Amelia Everly's freckled nose as she adjusted her straw hat, squinting at the gaggle of tourists before her.  They were a motley crew, this group: a giggling family with sticky fingers, a pair of stoic Germans who looked perpetually unimpressed, and a lone elderly woman clutching a worn notebook. They stood in the heart of Pompeii, an open-air museum sculpted from ash and time. 

Amelia inhaled the dusty air, thick with the scent of sunbaked stone and the faint echo of a past forever frozen. This was her domain, this city consumed by Vesuvius's wrath, where the whispers of forgotten lives still danced among the crumbling walls and blackened skeletons of houses. 

"Welcome, everyone," Amelia chirped, her voice carrying over the murmur of the crowd. "To Pompeii, a city that time forgot."  


She gestured to the forum ahead, a grand expanse now reclaimed by vines and wildflowers. "Here," she continued, her tone shifting to one of hushed reverence, "we stand in the heart of Roman life. Imagine bustling marketplaces, chariot races, political debates..."

Amelia paused, letting the image sink in before launching into the story of Pompeii, weaving tales of daily life and tragic demise, guiding them through this timeless city, sharing its secrets and sorrows with each step.
