The bell above the door jingled its tired tune as Amelia Beatrice Winthrop surveyed the shop. Her salon, "Winsome Waves," was bathed in the warm glow of the afternoon sun, dust motes dancing in the golden beams that sliced through the haze of hairspray. The scent of lavender shampoo and vanilla conditioner hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed her frayed nerves.  

Today, however, Amelia felt a prickle of unease under her perfectly coiffed bob. A thick silence had settled over Winsome Waves, punctuated only by the rhythmic whirring of her trusty blow dryer. It was Tuesday afternoon, normally the busiest time, bustling with chattering clients and the clinking of hairspray bottles.  But today, the chairs were empty, a stark emptiness that mirrored the hollowness in Ameliaâ€™s own chest. 


The silence felt more accusatory than peaceful, each tick of the antique clock on the wall a hammer blow against her anxieties. This wasn't just an off day; something was deeply wrong. And Amelia, with a heart full of trepidation, knew she had to find out what it was.
