The recycled air smelled faintly of stale coffee and forgotten dreams. Amelia "Amy" Grace Hawthorne adjusted her crisp blue uniform, smoothing down the imaginary crease on her skirt. The overhead bins were already crammed with luggage – oversized suitcases bursting at the seams, duffel bags spilling their contents onto the floor, and a lone violin case that looked distinctly out of place amidst the chaos.  

She was stationed in the aisle between rows 17 and 18, a prime spot for monitoring passengers who took too many selfies or whose conversations could be heard from the cockpit. The plane, a Boeing 747 affectionately nicknamed "The Queen Bee" by her colleagues, rumbled with anticipation on the tarmac at JFK airport. It was just past dawn, and the sky outside flickered with shades of orange and pink, promising a beautiful sunrise over the Atlantic. But Amy wasn't focused on the view. Her eyes scanned the cabin, searching for any sign of trouble – a spilled drink, an anxious passenger, or worse, someone who looked like they might try to steal a bag of pretzels from the galley without paying. 


It was going to be a long flight.
