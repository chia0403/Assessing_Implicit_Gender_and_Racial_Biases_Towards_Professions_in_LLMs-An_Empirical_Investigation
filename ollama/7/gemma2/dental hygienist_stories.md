The fluorescent lights hummed above Penelope Evangeline Brighton’s head like a chorus of nervous bees. The sterile smell of disinfectant and peppermint clung to the air, a scent Penelope both hated and found oddly comforting. Outside, rain lashed against the windows of Bright Smile Dental, blurring the vibrant cityscape into an impressionist painting of greys and greens. It was a Wednesday afternoon, the slowest part of the day, which usually meant Penelope had time to catch up on patient records or alphabetize the dental floss selection.

But today, a sense of foreboding hung in the air thicker than usual. A new patient was scheduled for 3:00 pm, and his name – Silas Blackwood – sent a shiver down Penelope's spine.  Blackwood had an unsettling reputation, whispered about in hushed tones among her colleagues. He was known to be difficult, evasive, and possessed of a pair of eyes that seemed to see right through you. 

Penelope adjusted her blue scrubs and smoothed the white coat over her chest, trying to convince herself it was just another patient.  Just another Wednesday afternoon. But deep down, she knew this appointment would be anything but ordinary.
