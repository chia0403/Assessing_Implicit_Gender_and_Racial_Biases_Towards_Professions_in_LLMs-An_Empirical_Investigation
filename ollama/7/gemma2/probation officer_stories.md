The air hung thick with humidity in New Orleans, clinging to Officer Clementine "Clem" Dubois like a second skin as she navigated the bustling French Quarter.  Wisteria vines clambered up brick facades, their purple blooms heavy with dew, and the aroma of beignets mingled with the tang of cheap perfume and salt air. Clem adjusted her ill-fitting suit jacket, wishing for the comfort of her worn jeans and faded band t-shirt. 

She was here on a routine check-in for Antoine "Tony" LaCroix, a young man who'd gotten caught up in the city's underbelly with a stolen guitar and a few bad decisions. Tony was supposed to meet Clem at Café Du Monde around midday, but he was running late, which wasn't exactly unusual for him. 

Clem scanned the café’s courtyard, her gaze flitting over the tourists sipping chicory coffee, their cameras aimed at every corner of this historic neighborhood. She spotted Tony's familiar mop of dark hair under a faded baseball cap near a table tucked in the shade. He was hunched over, fiddling with something in his hands. Clem took a deep breath, her heart sinking as she noticed the glint of metal nestled amongst Tony's fingers - not just any metal, but the unmistakable gleam of a switchblade.
