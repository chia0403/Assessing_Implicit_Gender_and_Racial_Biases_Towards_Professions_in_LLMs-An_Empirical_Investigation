The Arizona sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart"  Jackson's neck like an angry blacksmith hammer. Sweat beaded on his forehead, dripping into his eyes as he gripped the jagged edge of the asphalt crack filler. The hiss of escaping air from the pressurized tank was the soundtrack to his day, a metallic symphony punctuated by the rumble of passing trucks and the distant whine of a jackhammer further down the stretch of highway 19.  

Bart squinted at the endless ribbon of grey stretching before him, shimmering in the heat haze. He'd been patching this particular section for three weeks now, a never-ending battle against the relentless forces of time, weather, and the unforgiving weight of eighteen-wheelers. The asphalt seemed to stretch on forever, a monotonous expanse broken only by the occasional blur of color â€“ a beat-up pickup truck towing a trailer overflowing with hay, a sleek sports car roaring past like a desert viper. 


The desolate landscape around him was punctuated by scrubby cacti and the occasional lone Joshua tree, their branches reaching up like skeletal fingers grasping for relief from the relentless sun. The air smelled of dust and diesel, a unique aroma that Bart had come to associate with home.  He wasn't sure what he'd do if he ever left this dusty stretch of highway, this world where time seemed to move slower and the only true constants were the sun, the asphalt, and the endless hum of progress.
