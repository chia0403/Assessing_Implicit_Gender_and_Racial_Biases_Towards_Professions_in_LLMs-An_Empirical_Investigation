The air in Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery's office smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation.  It was always like this during tax season – a potent blend of anxiety and caffeine keeping her afloat. The small, cluttered space on Elm Street, sandwiched between a dusty bookstore and a nail salon, thrummed with the frantic energy of people scrambling to meet the April deadline.

Bea herself sat perched on a wobbly stool behind her desk, sifting through stacks of receipts and W-2s like a seasoned archaeologist unearthing ancient secrets. The glow of her computer screen illuminated her face, highlighting the worry lines etched around her hazel eyes. She chewed on the end of her pen, contemplating the tangled mess of numbers before her – a puzzle that only someone with her particular brand of patience and expertise could decipher. 

Outside, the wind whipped through the bare branches of the old oak tree in front of her office, rattling the windowpanes like anxious whispers. It was the kind of day that mirrored the mood within – a storm brewing on the horizon, threatening to unleash chaos upon those unprepared. And Bea knew, with a sinking feeling in her stomach, that many wouldn't be.
