Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, each drop exploding on the glass like a tiny burst of frustration. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of antiseptic and desperation.  Eleanor Claire Beaumont, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight braid that mirrored the tension in her shoulders, meticulously prepared her patient's exercise equipment. 

Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, had been working at St. Jude's for five years, navigating the murky waters of human resilience and fragility.  She thrived on seeing patients regain control over their bodies after accidents or illnesses, but today, the familiar routine felt like a chore. A heavy, unspoken weight hung in the room, pressing down on her like the relentless storm outside.  The patient she was about to see, a young man named Michael, had been admitted just hours ago, his future uncertain. He'd been involved in a hit-and-run, leaving him with multiple fractures and a head injury. 

Ellie knew this would be a long road, but she also knew that every small victory, every tiny step forward, was a testament to the indomitable spirit of her patients.  She took a deep breath, smoothing down the wrinkles on her crisp white uniform. It was time to face the storm, both outside and within.
