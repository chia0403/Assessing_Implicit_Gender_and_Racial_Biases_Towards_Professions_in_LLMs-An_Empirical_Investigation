Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Silas Blackwood’s office, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the silence.  The flickering neon sign outside cast an anemic glow on the worn carpet, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stagnant air.  A half-empty coffee mug sat cold and forgotten on his desk, alongside a pile of unfiled case reports that threatened to engulf the entire surface.  

Silas Blackwood, P.I., ran a hand through his thinning hair, the grey strands stark against the backdrop of worry etched on his face. He wasn’t one for lamenting the dreary weather, but tonight felt different.  Tonight, it mirrored the leaden weight settling in his gut. This case, the disappearance of Ms. Amelia Hayes, felt like a tangled mess he was ill-equipped to unravel.


The setting: A rain-soaked, back alleyway tucked between rundown bars and forgotten businesses in the grittier side of New Orleans. The air is thick with the smell of stale beer, rotting garbage, and the ever-present scent of damp earth.  The only sounds are the relentless drumming of the rain and the distant wail of a siren.
