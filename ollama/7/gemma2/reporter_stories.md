The air hung thick with the smell of salt and decay in New Orleans' French Quarter. A humid July sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Dubois as she navigated the bustling streets, dodging tourists clutching maps and stray dogs scavenging for scraps. Amy adjusted her worn leather satchel, its contents – a battered notebook, a half-empty pack of cigarettes, and a well-thumbed copy of Faulkner’s “The Sound and the Fury” – bumping against her hip with each step. She was chasing a story, one that promised to unravel a long-buried secret in the city's notorious history, and she wouldn't rest until she had it.


The scent of beignets wafted from Cafe du Monde, but Amy wasn't hungry. Her stomach churned with a mix of anticipation and anxiety. This story, unlike the petty squabbles between City Council members or the occasional hurricane report she usually dealt with for The Louisiana Times, felt different. It was personal, pulling at her like an anchor to something dark and uncharted within the city's soul. 


She paused outside a wrought-iron gate, its peeling paint barely concealing faded fleur-de-lis symbols.  This was it, the address whispered by her informant – a name she knew only as "Old Man Gabriel," who claimed to hold the key to a forgotten scandal that threatened the city's very foundation. 



As Amy reached for the latch, a shiver ran down her spine. The silence around her was unnerving, broken only by the distant clang of a church bell and the rhythmic splashing of pigeons in a nearby fountain.  She steeled herself, taking a deep breath before pushing open the gate. Her heart pounded in her chest as she stepped into the unknown.
