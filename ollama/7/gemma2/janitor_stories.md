The sticky linoleum floor felt like another layer of grime beneath Eliana "Ellie" Rosewater's worn rubber boots. Moonlight filtered through the dusty skylights above, casting long, skeletal shadows from the overflowing trash cans lining the corridor. The pungent aroma of stale coffee and unwashed despair hung heavy in the air. This was her kingdom â€“ the echoing halls and forgotten corners of the grand, decaying Majestic Theater.

Ellie had been scrubbing floors here for ten years, ever since she graduated high school with a diploma she still hadn't figured out what to do with. The theater, once a haven for laughter and applause, now stood silent, its velvet seats ripped and vacant, the stage shrouded in cobwebs.  It was a tomb of forgotten dreams, and Ellie, its only inhabitant after hours, felt more like a ghost herself.
