The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and spilled champagne, the remnants of the revelry that had erupted mere hours before.  Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont, her name tag slightly askew beneath her crisp white uniform, maneuvered her cart through the labyrinthine hallways of the Grand Blackwood Hotel. The opulent space, once gleaming, now wore an air of weariness; velvet curtains were drawn against the dawn light filtering in from the city streets below, and scattered confetti clung stubbornly to the ornate carpets. 

Ellie, a woman of quiet strength with eyes that held both kindness and a hint of world-weariness, navigated the deserted lobby with practiced ease. Her cart, laden with fresh towels and toiletries, bumped gently against the worn marble floor, the only sound besides the distant hum of the hotel's antiquated air conditioning system. The silence was heavy, broken only by the occasional groan of settling wood and the muffled drip of a leaking faucet in the ballroom. Ellie sighed, her breath catching briefly in the stale air. Another night, another story unfolding within these gilded walls, and she, the ever-present witness, would be there to catch the echoes.
