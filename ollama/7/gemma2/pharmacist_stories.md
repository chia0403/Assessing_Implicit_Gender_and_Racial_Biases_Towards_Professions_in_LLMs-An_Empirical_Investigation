The flickering neon sign outside "Greenleaf Apothecary" cast a sickly yellow glow on Elara Nightingale's freckled face as she meticulously counted out pills into amber glass vials. Rain lashed against the shop window, blurring the vibrant street scene outside into an Impressionist painting of colour and motion. 

Elara, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, adjusted her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose. The air inside the shop smelled faintly of lavender and peppermint, a comforting scent that usually soothed her nerves. But tonight, a prickle of unease ran down her spine. It wasn't just the storm brewing outside; something felt different, off-kilter. 


The bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer, pulling Elara out of her thoughts. She turned to greet them, ready with a warm smile â€“  a skill honed by years of dispensing both medication and comfort in equal measure. But the smile faltered as she saw who stood in the doorway. A tall figure cloaked in shadow, their face obscured by the wide brim of a hat, entered the shop, bringing with them a chill that had nothing to do with the storm.
