The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows of the ambulance, blurring the neon signs of downtown into streaks of garish color. Inside,  Amelia "Amy" Grace Harding wrestled with the IV line in her patient's arm, her brow furrowed in concentration. The young woman, no older than 20, lay pale and still on the stretcher, her chest rising and falling in shallow breaths.

She muttered reassurances to the patient, her voice calm and soothing amidst the panicked cries of bystanders. The sirens wailed, a mournful chorus echoing through the rain-soaked streets as they sped towards the hospital, each second a precious commodity in this high-stakes race against time.
