The greasy spoon diner smelled like burnt coffee and desperation, which was pretty much the same vibe as any truck stop at 3 am. A thin film of dust hung in the air, illuminated by the flickering neon sign outside that promised "Home Cookin'" with a shaky, faded glow.

Behind the counter, Agnes "Aggie" Pearl Butterfield wiped down a mug with a rag that had seen better days. Her face was weathered and lined like an old road map, her eyes as sharp and watchful as a hawk's.  Aggie had been running this joint for longer than she cared to remember, serving up lukewarm coffee and day-old pie to truckers who needed a break from the endless asphalt ribbon that snaked across the country. 

The bell above the door jingled, announcing another weary traveler. Aggie didn't look up. She knew him already. Tall, lean build with a shock of unruly blonde hair peeking out from under his trucker hat, he had the kind of quiet intensity that spoke volumes without saying a word. This was Caleb "Cal" Jericho, and he was her most frequent customer -  a man who seemed as lost in his thoughts as she was in her routine. 


He shuffled towards the counter, his boots heavy on the linoleum floor, leaving a trail of diesel fumes in his wake. He ordered a black coffee and sat down at his usual spot by the window, staring out into the darkness. Aggie knew he wasn't looking at the road, but at something else entirely -  something beyond the reach of these flickering lights.
