The flickering neon sign outside cast stripes of sickly green across Eleanor Beatrice Finch's desk, highlighting the meticulously organized stacks of files and the scattered legal pads covered in her precise script. Rain lashed against the windows of her small office, blurring the lights of the city below into a watercolor mess.  

Eleanor ran a hand through her already-disheveled auburn hair, sighing as she reread the client's letter for the tenth time. A simple case, at least on paper: a dispute over property ownership in rural Vermont. Simple cases were what Eleanor prided herself on - efficient, clean, with no messy emotional entanglements. Yet, this one gnawed at her. The words “long-held family secret” and “buried history” had been etched into the letter like cryptic warnings, pulling her deeper into a mystery she hadn't bargained for.  


The rain intensified, drumming against the windowpane like impatient fingers. Eleanor stared out at the cityscape, knowing that tomorrow, she would have to face the storm head-on.
