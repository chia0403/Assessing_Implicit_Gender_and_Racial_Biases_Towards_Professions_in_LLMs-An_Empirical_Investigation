The air hung thick with the scent of stale sweat and cheap perfume backstage at The Grand Guignol, a crumbling Victorian theater clinging precariously to the edge of forgotten Montmartre. Amelia Charlotte Beaumont, Director extraordinaire, surveyed the chaos with an eye that could spot a crooked set piece from across a Parisian street. 

Her silk scarf, crimson against her porcelain skin, whipped around her like a flag in a hurricane as she navigated the maze of props, costumes, and disgruntled actors. A half-finished papier-mâché dragon lay slumped on one side, its papier-mâché scales shimmering under the dim glow of an emergency light bulb. On the other, Jean-Pierre, a veteran actor known for his melodramatic entrances and even more dramatic temper tantrums, shrieked about his inadequate mustache wax. 

Amelia took it all in with a sigh that could have wilted a rosebush. Tonight was opening night for "Le Masque Rouge," their ambitious adaptation of a forgotten French gothic thriller.  It was Amelia’s masterpiece in the making, or at least that's what she told herself as her mind raced through a litany of potential disasters. If only she could wrangle this cast, tame this tempestuous stage, and somehow convince the audience that "Le Masque Rouge" wasn’t just another theatrical train wreck waiting to happen.
