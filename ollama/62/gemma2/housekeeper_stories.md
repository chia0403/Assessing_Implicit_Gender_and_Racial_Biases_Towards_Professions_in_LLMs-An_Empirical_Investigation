The scent of lavender and lemon clung to Elara Bellweather like a second skin. It was her signature blend, one she carefully crafted each morning using essential oils and water in her antique silver diffuser. The aroma permeated every corner of the stately Victorian mansion, masking the stale air that always seemed to linger in its shadowed hallways. 

Elara had been housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for five years, ever since Mrs. Hawthorne, the previous owner, had passed away. She'd come highly recommended by Mrs. Hawthorne's niece, now the current mistress of the house, a woman named Amelia who was as icy and elegant as the antique silver she collected. 

The mansion itself was a labyrinthine beast, with creaking floorboards, dusty portraits that seemed to follow you with their eyes, and an unsettling silence broken only by the occasional rustle of wind through the overgrown garden. It was a place where secrets whispered from the walls and history clung to every cobwebbed corner like a shroud. 


Elara, however, found solace in its routines, in the familiar weight of her feather duster, in the satisfying click of the lock as she secured each room before retiring for the night. She knew every creak, every shadow, every whisper of Blackwood Manor. Yet, lately, something felt different. A prickling unease that sent shivers down her spine, like a cold wind blowing through the house even on the warmest summer day.
