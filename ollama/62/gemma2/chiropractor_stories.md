The rhythmic whirring of Dr. Eleanor Vance's adjusting table was the only sound besides the soft crackle of the antique fireplace in her waiting room. Outside, snow fell relentlessly, blanketing the quaint town of Havenwood in a serene silence.  Eleanor peered through the frosty windowpane, watching fat flakes dance against the lamplight spilling from her office. 

Her practice, "Havenwood Holistic Wellness," was nestled on Main Street, sandwiched between a bustling bakery and a bookstore overflowing with worn paperbacks. Though tucked away in this seemingly peaceful corner of Maine, Eleanor’s days were rarely quiet. Her patients, a diverse mix of locals seeking relief from everything from chronic back pain to the stress of winter living, kept her schedule filled.

Tonight, however, was different. The snowstorm had deterred most from venturing out, leaving only a handful of appointments scattered throughout the evening. Eleanor leaned back in her worn leather chair, a mug of chamomile tea warming her hands. A quiet contentment settled over her as she took in the familiar scent of cinnamon and pine that filled her office – a comforting aroma that always seemed to ease both herself and her patients.
