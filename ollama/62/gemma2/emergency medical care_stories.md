The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and burnt rubber, a nauseating cocktail that always accompanied a major accident. Rain hammered down on Amelia “Amy” Grace Thorne’s windshield, blurring the red and blue lights strobing in the distance. She gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the leather. Another call, another chance to make a difference. 

The setting sun cast long, bloody shadows across the mangled wreckage of a two-car collision. Twisted metal groaned under the weight of the downpour, and the air was thick with the screams of the injured and the urgent commands of police officers directing traffic.  Amy pulled her ambulance into position, her heart pounding in sync with the wail of sirens. This wasn't just another day on the job; this one felt different. The raw energy in the air thrummed through her, whispering a warning she couldn't ignore. Something about this accident felt... heavy.
