Sunlight slanted through the stained-glass window depicting a chaotic scene of mythical creatures battling dragons, casting vibrant rainbows across the mismatched furniture and travel posters plastered on every inch of wall space.  Eloise, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun that threatened to unravel with each impatient tap of her pen, squinted at the computer screen. It displayed a list of "Unsold Packages," a grim reminder of the dwindling tourism market since the global unrest began.

Her phone buzzed, breaking the silence of her otherwise bustling office. Eloise sighed. Most likely another frantic parent canceling their family vacation to Greece. But the caller ID read "Unknown," a flicker of intrigue replacing the weariness in her eyes.
