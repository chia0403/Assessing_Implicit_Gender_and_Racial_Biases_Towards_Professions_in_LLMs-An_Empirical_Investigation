The acrid smell of gunpowder hung heavy in the air, clinging to Evelyn Blackwood’s coat like a shroud. It was a scent she’d grown accustomed to over her years as a forensic psychologist with the Chicago Police Department. 

Evelyn pushed past yellow tape, ignoring the murmur of police chatter and the flashing blue lights that painted the alleyway in an unsettling strobe effect. The scene before her was grim: a narrow passage choked with overflowing garbage bins and flickering streetlamps casting long, distorted shadows. In the center, sprawled against a damp brick wall, lay a man, his lifeblood staining the grimy asphalt crimson.

She took a deep breath, trying to quell the rising wave of nausea. Evelyn Blackwood, Ph.D., wasn't easily fazed by death, but there was something about this scene that felt different, more brutal than the usual despair she encountered. This wasn't just a crime; it felt personal.


The setting: A dark, narrow alleyway in Chicago's West Side during a drizzly evening.
