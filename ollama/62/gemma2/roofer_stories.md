The morning mist clung to Jasper "Jazz" Riley's weathered boots as he squinted at the sunrise, a smear of orange across the steel skyline.  Sweat beaded on his brow already, even before the sun had fully pierced the haze that hung low over Chicago. He adjusted the brim of his faded baseball cap and took a deep breath, inhaling the familiar scent of hot tar and dew-soaked concrete. Another day, another roof to conquer. 

Jazz worked for Old Man Murphy's roofing crew, a ragtag bunch of veterans who knew every trick of the trade and had seen their fair share of Chicago storms. The city was their canvas, its endless sprawl a tapestry woven with slate, tile, and rusted metal.  Today, their job was the Grandview Apartments, a towering monstrosity on the edge of the Loop, where pigeons flocked like feathered clouds on the fire escapes and wind whipped through the canyons between buildings. Jazz liked these high-altitude jobs; they offered a unique perspective, a chance to see the city sprawling beneath him like a metallic patchwork quilt. 


He shouldered his toolbox – battered and dented, just like him – and clambered onto the ladder, its rusted rungs groaning under his weight. He was starting at the top, as always, facing down the dizzying drop with a practiced calm. The city was waiting. And Jazz Riley, master roofer of Chicago's forgotten rooftops, was ready to meet it head-on.
