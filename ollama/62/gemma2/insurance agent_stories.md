The humid Miami air hung heavy, thick with the scent of salt and hibiscus. Sunlight glinted off the turquoise expanse of Biscayne Bay, illuminating the yachts bobbing lazily in their moorings. But inside the cramped office of "Coastal Claims & Coverage," Amelia Pearlington wasn't admiring the view. She was drowning in paperwork. 

Amelia ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, sighing as she stared at the mountain of insurance applications piled on her desk. As a claims adjuster for Coastal Claims & Coverage, she was used to dealing with the aftermath of hurricanes, sinkholes, and the occasional rogue alligator incident. But today's deluge was different. It was an avalanche of "luxury home" policies, each one more intricate than the last, filled with clauses about rare art collections, priceless antiques, and swimming pools designed by renowned architects.  

Amelia pinched the bridge of her nose. She knew she couldn't afford to make a single mistake. One oversight could cost her company dearly. And it was going to take every ounce of her sharp wit and tenacity – not to mention a hefty dose of coffee – to navigate this sea of spreadsheets and legal jargon.
