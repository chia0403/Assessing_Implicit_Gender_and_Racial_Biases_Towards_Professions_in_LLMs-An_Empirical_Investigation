The Grand Blackwood Hotel hummed with a life that never truly slept. Even at 3 AM, its labyrinthine halls throbbed with muffled conversations from late-night revelers, the rhythmic clinking of glasses from the lobby bar, and the faint strains of jazz drifting from the smoky speakeasy on the lower level.  

Amongst this nocturnal symphony worked Thaddeus "Teddy" Bellweather, a young bellhop with perpetually windblown hair and eyes that mirrored the polished brass buttons adorning his uniform. He weaved through the shadowy corridors, a silent phantom carrying suitcases and delivering forgotten toiletries with an almost preternatural grace. Teddy wasn't just efficient; he possessed a knack for anticipating his guests' needs, a sixth sense honed by years of observing the subtle cues and unspoken desires of the hotel's eclectic clientele. He was a master of discretion, a confidante to secrets whispered in hushed tones, a silent witness to loves blooming and crumbling under the dim glow of the lobby lamps.

Tonight, however, Teddy felt a prickle of unease. The air itself seemed charged, thicker than usual with anticipation. A storm was brewing outside, mirroring the tempest gathering within him. Something about the night felt different, and Teddy couldn't shake the feeling that he was about to be swept up in it.
