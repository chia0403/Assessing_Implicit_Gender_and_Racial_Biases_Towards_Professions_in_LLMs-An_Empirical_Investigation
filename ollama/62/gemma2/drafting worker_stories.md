The whirring of the drafting table fan barely masked the oppressive heat radiating from the steel behemoth humming in the corner. Sweat beaded on Elara Celeste's brow as she squinted at her blueprints, the harsh fluorescent lights casting an almost sickly pallor over the cluttered workbench. Her pencils danced across the parchment, etching intricate lines that would soon become the skeleton of a towering skyscraper, a monument to progress and steel nestled amidst the sprawling industrial sprawl of New Elysium City.  

Elara wasn't one for admiring her own handiwork. She saw each blueprint as a puzzle to solve, a challenge to overcome with precision and logic.  Her focus was laser-sharp, her mind lost in the labyrinthine network of beams and supports she was meticulously constructing on paper. The city outside thrummed with life – a cacophony of sirens, clanging metal, and distant laughter – but here, in this cramped corner office, time seemed to stand still. 

Outside the window, a crimson sun bled into the horizon, painting the smog-choked sky in hues of bruised orange and sickly yellow. Elara sighed, pushing back her thick auburn braid that had loosened from its pins.  It was another day done, another blueprint completed. Another brick laid in the ever-expanding concrete jungle.
