The fluorescent lights hummed above Michael "Mike" Callaghan's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn linoleum floor of his office. Papers piled high on his desk like miniature mountains, each one representing another soul teetering on the edge of the law. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the Phoenix Probation Department building, turning the glass facade into a shimmering mirage. Mike rubbed his temples, trying to massage away the tension that had become a permanent fixture in his life. He felt like he was drowning in paperwork and desperate pleas, constantly battling against the tide of societal decay. 

He glanced at the calendar on his wall, circled red with appointments for parole hearings and mandatory meetings. Today was particularly daunting; he had to meet with Ricardo Flores, a young man fresh out of prison and struggling to navigate life back in the community. Mike knew Ricardoâ€™s case was precarious. He'd served time for drug trafficking, and his past whispered of gang ties and violence. 

As the first chime announcing lunchtime chimed through the office, Mike sighed. This wasn't a job; it was an uphill battle against oblivion.
