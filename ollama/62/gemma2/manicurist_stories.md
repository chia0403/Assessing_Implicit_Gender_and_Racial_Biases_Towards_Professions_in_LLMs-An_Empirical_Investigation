The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and jasmine as Esmeralda Valencia filed down a client's chipped crimson nail. She hummed along to the salsa music spilling from the radio, her movements practiced and precise. The "Pink Paradise" salon was bathed in warm light, its walls adorned with whimsical murals depicting manicured hands reaching for pink clouds and glitter-strewn rainbows. 

Esmeralda loved this place. It felt like a haven away from the grit of downtown Miami, a space where women could escape their worries and emerge feeling pampered and empowered.  But today, even Esmeralda couldn't shake a nagging sense of unease. A chill wind seemed to whisper through the salon, rustling the beaded curtains that separated the manicure station from the rest of the room. And for the first time in years, her usually vibrant pink acrylics felt a little dull, like a warning sign she couldn't decipher.
