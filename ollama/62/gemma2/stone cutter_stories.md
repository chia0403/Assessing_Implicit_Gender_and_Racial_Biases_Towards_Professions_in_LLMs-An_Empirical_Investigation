The air hung heavy with the smell of granite dust and sweat in Elias Thorne's workshop. Sunlight slanted through the grime-coated windows, illuminating swirling motes dancing in the thick haze. The rhythmic clang of hammer on chisel echoed off the rough-hewn walls, punctuated by the occasional grunt of exertion from Elias himself. 

His broad back was stooped, his hands calloused and strong, honed by years of coaxing beauty from unforgiving stone.  Elias ran a damp cloth across his brow, wiping away beads of sweat that clung to his weathered face. He squinted at the half-finished sculpture before him: a majestic falcon, wings spread in mid-flight, its obsidian eyes glittering with an eerie life. It was meant to be a centerpiece for the city's newly built grand plaza, a testament to their prosperity and strength. But lately, Elias felt a growing unease about his work. 

The stone seemed to resist him, refusing to yield to his hammer blows as it once had. He saw strange, shifting patterns in its depths, whispers of something ancient and powerful. It was like the stone itself held secrets, and they were whispering to him, urging him towards a path he wasn't sure he wanted to take.
