The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and printer ink, a familiar perfume to Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Finch, but this morning it felt suffocating. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over her cluttered workspace - a battlefield of crumpled sketches, half-empty mugs, and stray color swatches. Her latest client, a local bakery, wanted their logo redesigned – again. Amy sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. 

The bakery was charming, with its mismatched vintage furniture and shelves laden with freshly baked bread, but the owner's demands were endless. "More whimsical," "less modern," "make the croissants look more… croissant-y."  Amy wanted to scream. She'd given them three concepts already, each one meticulously crafted, yet they remained dissatisfied. 

It was a Tuesday afternoon in Seattle, the city shrouded in its usual layer of misty grey. Rain threatened to fall, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amy. The vibrant murals adorning the brick buildings outside offered little comfort, their cheerful colors clashing with the bleakness she felt creeping into her creative soul.   


This wasn't what she had envisioned when she started her own graphic design firm just a year ago. She dreamed of collaborating with innovative brands, crafting bold visuals that told captivating stories. Instead, she was stuck in a rut, drowning in mundane requests and battling constant dissatisfaction.
