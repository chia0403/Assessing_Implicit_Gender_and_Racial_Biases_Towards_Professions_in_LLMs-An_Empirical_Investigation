The aroma of disinfectant and freshly scrubbed linoleum hung heavy in Dr. Amelia Katherine Thorne’s nostrils. It was always like this in the early morning hours at Pine Ridge Animal Clinic – a symphony of quiet hums from the heating system, the distant rumble of the town waking up outside, and the ever-present scent of antiseptic. 

Amelia sighed as she pulled on her scrubs, the familiar weight settling comfortably against her skin. Outside the window, the first blush of dawn was painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, a stark contrast to the sterile white walls that surrounded her. This small town nestled between the mountains was her sanctuary, a place where she could mend not just broken bones and torn ligaments, but also frayed hearts both human and animal.  

Today, however, promised to be anything but ordinary. A frantic call from a local farmer had come in during the late evening, describing an injured horse that needed immediate attention. Amelia knew this wasn't just another routine checkup; there was urgency in the farmer’s voice, a desperation that echoed in her own heart. 


As she finished tying her apron around her waist, Amelia took a deep breath and stepped into the bustling world of Pine Ridge Animal Clinic, ready to face whatever the day might bring.
