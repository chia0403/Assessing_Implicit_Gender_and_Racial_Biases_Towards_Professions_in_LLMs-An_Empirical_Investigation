The bell above the door chimed with an almost cheerful trill as Eleanor Beatrice Peabody adjusted her floral-patterned blouse, smoothing out the nonexistent wrinkles.  It was 8:01 am, precisely fifteen minutes before the doors to Dr. Albright's office officially opened for the day. The waiting room, bathed in the pale morning light filtering through gauzy curtains, remained quiet, save for the gentle hum of the vintage clock on the wall. Eleanor sighed, a delicate puff of air escaping her nostrils as she straightened the neatly stacked magazines on the table.

It wasn't the silence that bothered Eleanor, nor was it the predictable flow of anxious patients shuffling in throughout the day. It was the monotony, the repetitive rhythm of answering phones, scheduling appointments, and dispensing lukewarm tea that slowly chipped away at her spirit. She longed for something more, a flicker of excitement to break through the beige monotony of Dr. Albright's office, tucked away on the second floor of a stately building overlooking a bustling city street.  


**Setting:** 

A modest, yet cozy waiting room in a second-floor doctor’s office. The décor is a mix of vintage and modern, with floral patterns, faded velvet armchairs, and a large grandfather clock ticking steadily in the corner. Large windows overlook a busy city street, offering glimpses of the daily hustle and bustle below.  The atmosphere is generally calm and quiet, punctuated by the occasional phone call or shuffling feet.
