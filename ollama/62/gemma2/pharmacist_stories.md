The bell above the door to "Apothecary & Co." jingled with a tired, almost apologetic sound as Eleanor Beaumont stepped inside. The afternoon sun streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the shelves crammed with bottles of every shape and size.  Eleanor sighed, her shoulders slumping under the weight of another long day at City General. She craved the familiar scent of dried herbs and lavender that always seemed to permeate the old shop, a comforting antidote to the sterile smell of antiseptic and fear that clung to the hospital halls. 


"Well now," a warm voice greeted her, "if it isn't Miss Beaumont. Come in, come in.  The day can't possibly be as dreary inside those walls."

Eleanor smiled, the tension easing slightly from her shoulders. She glanced around the cluttered shop. A worn rug lay beneath her feet, its faded colors a testament to years of foot traffic. Jars filled with colorful powders lined the shelves, nestled between antique mortars and pestles.  In the corner, an old woman with kind eyes and wispy white hair sat at a desk, carefully grinding herbs in a mortar.


This was Apothecary & Co., Eleanor's sanctuary, a world away from the relentless demands of her job as a pharmacist at City General. This is where she felt truly herself, surrounded by the quiet magic of herbal remedies and the comforting presence of her grandmother, Agnes, who had taught her everything she knew about healing with nature.
