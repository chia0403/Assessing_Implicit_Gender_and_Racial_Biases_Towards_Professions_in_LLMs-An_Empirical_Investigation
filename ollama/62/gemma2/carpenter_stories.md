The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and varnish as Elias Blackwood meticulously planed the edge of a mahogany tabletop. Sunlight streamed through the open window of his workshop, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air.  Outside, the rhythmic clatter of horses' hooves on cobblestone echoed from the bustling market square just beyond his quiet street in London. But inside, Elias existed in a world of precise measurements and smooth, flowing lines, where wood transformed under his calloused hands into something beautiful and functional. His workshop, crammed with tools of every conceivable size and purpose, was his sanctuary. Here, amidst the constant hum of creation, he found peace and purpose.

He knew, even without seeing who stood outside, that it would be another commission request. London was booming, and carpenters were in high demand. 


“Just a minute!” he called out, his voice rough from years of shouting over the din of his workshop. He straightened his apron, smoothed down his unruly beard, and strode towards the door, ready to face whatever project awaited him.
