The smoke billowed like an angry beast against the bruised twilight sky, painting the Seattle skyline in hues of orange and purple.  Rain lashed down, slicking the pavement and turning the world into a hazy mirror reflecting the inferno raging just blocks away. Inside the roaring engine of Engine 37, Lieutenant Evelyn "Eve" O'Connell tightened her helmet strap, the familiar weight comforting amidst the chaos. The air buzzed with the rhythmic clang of hydraulics, the frantic chatter of her crewmates, and the gut-wrenching wail of the siren cutting through the city's symphony of rain and distress calls. 

Eve could feel the heat even from inside the truck, a premonition of the furnace awaiting them. The call had been brief: four-alarm blaze, possible entrapment on the top floor of an apartment building in Belltown. As she gripped the steering wheel, her gaze swept across the panicked faces staring out from their windows, each silhouette a desperate plea for salvation. 

Eve took a deep breath, steeling herself. This was what they trained for, this was why they lived with the constant hum of adrenaline, the shadow of danger always lurking at the edge of visibility.  Tonight, the city needed them, and Lieutenant Evelyn O'Connell wouldn't let it down.
