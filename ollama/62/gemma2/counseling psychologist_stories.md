The Seattle rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Grace's window, mimicking the relentless drumming in her own chest. She sat perched on the edge of her desk, staring out at the grey cityscape blurred by sheets of water cascading down the glass. Her office, usually a haven of warm wood and calming colours, felt suffocating today. The air hung thick with unspoken anxieties, mirroring the storm raging outside. 

Amelia wasn't sure what had gotten into her. Maybe it was the stack of client files on her desk, each one whispering stories of heartbreak, grief, and shattered dreams. Or maybe it was the gnawing emptiness she felt inside, a hollowness that seemed to grow with each passing day. Whatever the cause, Amelia found herself battling an unwelcome wave of self-doubt.  

Was she truly helping these people? Were her words, her guidance, enough to mend their fractured lives? 


The rain intensified, its rhythmic pounding a constant reminder of the turmoil both within and outside her office walls. Then, the doorbell chimed, breaking the oppressive silence and jolting Amelia back to reality. A new client. A fresh start.
