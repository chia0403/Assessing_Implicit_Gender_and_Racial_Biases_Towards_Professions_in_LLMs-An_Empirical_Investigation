The rhythmic whirring of clippers sliced through the afternoon silence in Arthur Bartholomew "Barth" Bellweather's barbershop. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through the grime-streaked window, illuminating whorls of hair caught in Barth's meticulous net and discarded on the worn linoleum floor.  The scent of bay rum and lemon oil hung heavy in the air, a comforting familiarity to regulars who’d sat in Barth’s chair for decades, their stories as familiar as the faded floral wallpaper. 

Barth himself was a study in calm, his hands moving with practiced precision over Mr. Henderson's unruly silver mane. He listened patiently as Mr. Henderson grumbled about the new parking regulations downtown, his face softening only when Mrs. Peterson entered, her usual bright smile crinkling the corners of her eyes. 


“Barth, darling,” she purred, settling into the chair, "I hear there’s a storm brewing."

He glanced at the darkening sky outside, a curtain of grey swallowing the afternoon sun. "Aye, Mrs. Peterson," he said, his voice low and rumbling like distant thunder, "Seems we might be in for a real one."


His words hung in the air as another gust rattled the windowpanes, leaving Barth with a sense that something more than just rain was brewing.
