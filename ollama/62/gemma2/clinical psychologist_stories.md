The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window, each drop a tiny drumbeat against the silence within.  Her view was obscured by streaks of water, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic canvas of grays and greens. The clock ticked relentlessly on her mahogany desk, each click a reminder that her lunch break had long since expired. She wasn't hungry though. Not with the gnawing anxiety in her gut, fueled by the case file open before her. 

Eleanor Vance, renowned for her calm demeanor and insightful analysis of the human psyche, felt a tremor of unease she hadn't experienced in years.  The patient, a young woman named Anya Petrov, claimed to be plagued by vivid nightmares – not just unsettling dreams, but full-blown, waking hallucinations that bled into reality.

Her office was tucked away on the seventh floor of an aging building in Chicago's historic Loop district. Sunlight rarely penetrated the heavy drapes, casting long shadows across the worn Persian rug and antique leather chairs. The air was thick with the scent of lavender essential oil and old books – a comforting aroma for most, but tonight it did little to soothe Eleanor's mounting apprehension.  


Anya would be arriving any minute now.
