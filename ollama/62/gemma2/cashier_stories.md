The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Beatrice Finchâ€™s head like a hive of agitated bees.  She tapped her acrylic nails against the worn countertop of the register, the rhythmic click-clack a counterpoint to the bored drone of the canned pop music blaring from the store's speakers. 

Elara stared out at the desolate aisle, watching dust motes dance in the pale beam of the overhead light. It was 9:47 pm on a Wednesday, which meant two things: the graveyard shift had officially begun, and nobody ever came to ShopRite this late unless they were desperate.  


The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and forgotten produce. The only sound besides the music and Elara's drumming was the distant rumble of an ice cream truck playing its tinny jingle somewhere beyond the store walls.
