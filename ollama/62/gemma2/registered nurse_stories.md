The rhythmic beeping of monitors filled the sterile air, punctuated by the occasional hiss of oxygen and muffled coughs from behind closed doors.  Amelia Claire Davies, her badge pinned neatly above her left breast pocket, adjusted the stethoscope hanging around her neck, its cold metal comforting against her skin. Her shift at St. Jude’s had only just begun, yet the familiar pre-dawn quiet already held a tense energy. A storm was brewing outside, mirroring the chaos that often unfolded within the hospital walls. 

St. Jude’s was a sprawling, old building, its aging bones creaking with every patient’s heartbeat and every footstep taken by the hurried staff. It sat on a windswept hill overlooking the town of Bayview, its windows reflecting the pale pre-dawn light like the eyes of a watchful giant. Amelia felt a familiar sense of responsibility settling over her shoulders, as heavy as the worn leather of her bag. 


This was where she belonged, amidst the urgency and the fragile hope, in this place where lives hung in the balance, day after day.
