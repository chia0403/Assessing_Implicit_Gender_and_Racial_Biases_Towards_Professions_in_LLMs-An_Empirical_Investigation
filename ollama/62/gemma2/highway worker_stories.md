The sun was a molten fist squeezing itself out from behind the jagged peaks of the Rockies, throwing long, skeletal shadows across Interstate 70. Dew clung to Brenda Jean Cartwright's work boots as she surveyed the day's work ahead: a mile stretch of asphalt pockmarked by frost heave and riddled with cracks that snaked like veins across its surface. The air was crisp, tinged with the scent of pine needles and distant rain. Brenda Jean adjusted the brim of her dusty Stetson and inhaled deeply, letting the fresh mountain air fill her lungs.

Each crack repaired, each patch laid down, represented a small victory over nature's indifference.
