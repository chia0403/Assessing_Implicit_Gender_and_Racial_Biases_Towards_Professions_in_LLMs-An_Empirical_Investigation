The incessant clatter of rain against the attic window was Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's only companion. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the gloom, illuminating rows upon rows of towering bookshelves that crammed every inch of the space. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and pipe tobacco, a lingering ghost of her late grandfather, the former owner of this ramshackle Victorian mansion perched precariously on the edge of the misty Cornish cliffs. 

Amelia, hunched over her battered typewriter in the center of the room, ignored the storm raging outside. Her fingers flew across the keys, churning out words like a desperate machine trying to outrun an encroaching darkness. The deadline for her latest novel loomed, a looming shadow threatening to swallow her whole if she didn't deliver.  She needed a break, a spark of inspiration, but all she found was the echo of silence and the relentless patter of rain against glass.
