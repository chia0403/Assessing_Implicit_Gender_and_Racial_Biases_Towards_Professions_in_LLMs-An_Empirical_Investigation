The air in Dr. Anya Patel’s office was thick with antiseptic and unspoken tension. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the midday sun beat down on bustling New Orleans, a cacophony of jazz music and chattering tourists filtering through the open window. Inside, however, everything felt hushed, expectant. 

Anya, her brown eyes narrowed in concentration as she reviewed patient charts, shifted restlessly in her chair. Today was different.  Today, Dr. Patel wouldn’t be alone in his examination room. Anya hadn't been prepared for the phone call this morning – a frantic request from her mentor, Dr. Joseph LeBlanc, asking for her help with an unusual case. A young woman, barely out of her teens, had arrived at the clinic exhibiting symptoms unlike anything he'd seen before.

"I need your fresh eyes on this, Anya," Dr. LeBlanc had pleaded, his voice tight with worry. "There's something...off about her." 


Anya, a physician’s assistant with a reputation for meticulous observation and a sharp intuition, knew she couldn't refuse. The clinic was their haven, a sanctuary in the heart of the vibrant city where they treated the forgotten, the overlooked, and those who simply couldn't afford anything else. This young woman deserved her best shot at healing, and Anya, despite her unease, was ready to give it to her.
