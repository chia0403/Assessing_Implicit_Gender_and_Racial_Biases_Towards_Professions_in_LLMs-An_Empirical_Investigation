The early morning mist clung to the weathered stone walls of Oakhaven Sanctuary like a phantom, muffling the usual cacophony of barks, chirps, and purrs.  Inside the warm barn, Elara Willowbrook was already up, her boots squelching in the straw as she made her rounds. Dawn was just breaking, painting the sky with soft hues of peach and rose, but for Elara, the day had already begun. 

Oakhaven wasn't your typical sanctuary. It wasn't a place where animals were simply kept safe; it was their haven, a vibrant tapestry woven with rescued souls - from abandoned farm dogs to orphaned owls, injured foxes, and even the occasional mischievous raccoon. Each animal held a story, a piece of Elara's heart, and she treated them all with the same unwavering love and dedication. 


This particular morning, a palpable tension hung in the air. The scent of hay mingled with something else - fear.  Elara frowned, her intuition tingling. Something was amiss. She moved quickly, checking on each pen, her touch reassuring, her voice soft as she spoke to the wary animals.
