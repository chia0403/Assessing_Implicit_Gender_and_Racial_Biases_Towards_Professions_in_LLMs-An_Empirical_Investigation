The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. Sunlight, filtered through a canopy of towering Douglas firs, dappled the forest floor in emerald and gold. The rhythmic thud of Elara Thorne’s chainsaw echoed through the stillness, a steady counterpoint to the chirping of unseen birds.  

Elara, her brow slick with sweat, expertly guided the saw through a fallen giant, its bark splitting with a satisfying crackle. She'd been logging these lands for as long as she could remember, inheriting the family business from her father and now running it alongside her brother. The rhythm of the forest was in her blood, the feel of rough bark beneath her calloused hands and the smell of fresh-cut wood a comfort she’d never known outside its confines. But lately, a growing unease had settled over her like a shroud.  The whispers started after the first tree fell with a hollow groan, a sound unlike any Elara had ever heard. A tremor in the earth, a rustle in the undergrowth beyond the familiar sounds of the forest... something was shifting.
