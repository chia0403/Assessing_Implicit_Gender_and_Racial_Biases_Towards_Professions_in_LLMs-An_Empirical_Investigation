The morning mist clung to Amelia Thistlewickâ€™s overalls like a shy lover, reluctant to let go. Dawn was just starting to paint the sky in hues of apricot and lavender as she surveyed the sprawling Victorian mansion before her. It loomed over the manicured lawn, a behemoth of brick and turrets, its windows gazing out blankly at the day ahead. Amelia, with her trusty trowel gripped firmly in hand, felt a familiar thrill course through her. 

This wasn't just another job. This was Thornhaven Manor, steeped in whispers and legend. Locals spoke of restless spirits and hidden secrets within its walls, but Amelia only saw a garden crying out for care.  The overgrown rose bushes choked the stone balustrade, ivy crept up the chimney like a greedy vine, and a single, defiant dandelion dared to sprout amidst the carefully arranged pebbles. 

It was her mission to bring this once-proud garden back to life, one spadeful of soil at a time. And she wouldn't let a few ghosts deter her.
