The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingled with the faint sweetness of Mrs. Periwinkle's lavender hand lotion. Amelia Thistlewood, OTR/L, sighed, pushing her unruly auburn curls behind her ear as she surveyed the room. Sunshine streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air. It was a charming space, really, with pale blue walls adorned with cheerful floral prints and a wicker rocking chair tucked beside a window overlooking the manicured garden. But it felt sterile, lifeless. 

This was Amelia's domain – the "Sunshine Room" at Maplewood Rehabilitation Center – where she fought to help patients reclaim their independence after strokes, accidents, or illnesses robbed them of their abilities. Today, however, her patient wasn’t eager for rehabilitation.  He sat slumped in his wheelchair, a shadow of his former self, staring blankly at the garden, lost in his own world. His name was Elias Caldwell, and Amelia knew he needed more than just physical therapy. He needed something to spark the fire within him, something to remind him why reaching out his hand, grasping a cup, or taking a tentative step mattered. 


Amelia took a deep breath, her gaze lingering on Elias’s pale hands resting limply in his lap.  Today was going to be different. She had an idea, a daring one, that she hoped would ignite the spark within him. It was time for him to see the sunshine again, not just through the window, but within himself.
