The humid Georgia air hung thick as molasses, clinging to Elijah "Sparks" Thornton's sweat-soaked t-shirt.  He wiped his brow with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a smear of grime across his tanned face. The dilapidated farmhouse loomed before him, its once vibrant paint peeling like sunburned skin. A rusted weather vane creaked precariously atop the roof, casting long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown yard. 

Sparks sighed, adjusting the worn leather tool belt that hung heavy on his hips. This wasn't the kind of job he usually took â€“ fixing faulty wiring in an abandoned farmhouse miles from civilization. But the old woman who called, claiming she heard whispers in her dead husband's radio and needed the power restored, had been so desperate, so utterly alone, that Sparks couldn't refuse. 


Now, staring at the warped wooden door and the tangle of rusted wires clinging to its frame, he wondered if maybe he should have just kept driving.
