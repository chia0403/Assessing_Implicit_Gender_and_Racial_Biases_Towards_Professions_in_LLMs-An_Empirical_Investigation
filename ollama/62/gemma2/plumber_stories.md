The rusted pipes groaned like arthritic knees as Thomas "Tommy" Buckminster wrestled with the stubborn elbow joint.  Sweat beaded on his brow, slicking back his greasy hair that stubbornly refused to be contained by its bandana prison. The cramped crawl space of Mrs. Peabody's Victorian bathroom smelled of mildew and despair – a familiar aroma in Tommy's line of work. 

Outside, the humid August air hung heavy over Oakhaven, a town nestled amidst rolling green hills and whispering oak trees.  The quaint facade couldn't mask the undercurrent of secrets that pulsed beneath its surface, whispers traded on porch swings and veiled glances across town square. This secret, however, wasn't one Tommy cared about. He had enough trouble navigating the tangled labyrinth of Mrs. Peabody's plumbing without worrying about local gossip.  But lately, even his world of pipes and wrenches felt… off. Like something was waiting beneath the surface, ready to burst forth with an unwelcome pressure.
