The air hung thick with the scent of blood and brine in the cramped back room of "Hawthorn & Son Butchery."  A symphony of rhythmic cleaving and bone-shattering thuds filled the space as Bartholomew Hawthorne expertly worked his way through a side of beef, his movements honed by decades spent wielding a butcher's knife. Sweat beaded on his brow, catching the flickering light of the gas lamp above him, casting his face in a mosaic of shadow and gleam. Outside, the cobblestones of London’s Fleet Street slicked with rain reflected the pale glow of the streetlamps. The city was alive with its usual cacophony - horse-drawn carriages clanging, hawkers shouting their wares, laughter spilling from pubs – but within those brick walls, it was a world unto itself. Bartholomew Hawthorne knew every sinew, every rib, every curve of an animal as intimately as he knew his own hands.  His father had taught him that respect for the beast, for its sacrifice, began in the act of butchering. And tonight, under the watchful gaze of his ancestors’ portraits lining the wall, Bartholomew was about to face a challenge unlike any he'd encountered before. 


The order had arrived earlier that day - an unusual one, delivered by a nervous young man with shadowed eyes and a whispered plea for secrecy. A whole stag, they said, delivered at dawn, with specific instructions: no waste, every part utilized. Bartholomew’s gut churned with unease. There was something unsettling about the request, a darkness that clung to it like the scent of blood.
