The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the rows of neatly aligned magazines in Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Hastings' waiting room. A faint scent of antiseptic mingled with the aroma of cinnamon and vanilla wafting from a bowl of homemade sugar-free cookies on the table beside her. Outside, the Chicago wind whipped around the corner building, rattling the windows like anxious fingers tapping against glass.

Eleanor adjusted her spectacles and glanced at the clock – 3:47 PM.  Just three minutes until Emily Peterson was due for their session. Eleanor hoped she wouldn't be late again. It wasn't personal; Emily was just chronically flustered, a symptom, Eleanor suspected, of her chronic stress and the constant pressure of juggling motherhood with a demanding career in marketing.  

But today felt different. There was a palpable tension in the air, an unspoken weight that settled heavily on Eleanor’s shoulders. The hum of the lights seemed louder, the scent of cinnamon sharper, and even the Chicago wind outside sounded more frantic. 


Eleanor wasn't sure what it was, but she had a feeling this session would be anything but ordinary.
