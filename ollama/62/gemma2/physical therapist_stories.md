The rain hammered against the windows of "Kinetic Rehabilitation," mimicking the insistent throbbing in Amelia Rose Thornton's temples.  Amelia wasn't sure if it was the storm, her overflowing to-do list, or the sheer monotony of paperwork that was causing the headache to bloom behind her eyes. She pushed a stray curl behind her ear, wishing for the tenth time she hadn't opted for a bold pixie cut when everyone else at the clinic seemed content with their long, flowing locks. Maybe a more dramatic hairstyle would have helped her feel less invisible amidst the constant flurry of patients and staff.

Amelia worked in the heart of bustling Chicago, where Kinetic Rehabilitation was tucked between a hip vegan cafe and a vintage record store. The building itself was a charming brick Victorian, its original facade preserved despite the modern gym equipment crammed within.  The air was thick with the smell of antiseptic, sweat, and something vaguely floral, which Amelia suspected came from Mrs. Peterson's aromatherapy diffuser. It wasn't exactly her favorite scent, but she had learned to tolerate it, just as she had learned to tolerate the ever-present din of clanging weights, whirring machines, and animated chatter.

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. A tall figure, hunched with what seemed like an unbearable stiffness in their shoulders, stepped into the warm glow of Kinetic Rehabilitation.  Amelia forced her gaze away from the paperwork and offered a bright smile. 


"Welcome to Kinetic Rehabilitation," she chirped, "how can I help you?"
