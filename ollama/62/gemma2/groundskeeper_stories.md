The morning mist clung to the manicured lawns like a shy child, refusing to fully disperse as Elias Bartholomew Thistlewick, head groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor, surveyed his domain. Sunlight, filtered through the ancient oak boughs lining the gravel drive, cast long, dancing shadows that stretched and warped with every gentle breeze. Elias, a man whose life was deeply entwined with the rhythm of the seasons, inhaled the crisp air, the scent of damp earth mingling with the faint sweetness of blooming honeysuckle.  

Blackwood Manor itself, a gothic behemoth of weathered stone and gargoyles perched like watchful sentinels, loomed in the distance, its windows reflecting the nascent sun like a thousand watchful eyes. It was a place of whispered histories and forgotten secrets, a canvas upon which Elias meticulously painted his artistry of order and beauty.  But this morning, something felt different. A disquiet hummed beneath the surface of the familiar peace, leaving Elias with a prickling sensation on the back of his neck that he couldn't quite shake.
