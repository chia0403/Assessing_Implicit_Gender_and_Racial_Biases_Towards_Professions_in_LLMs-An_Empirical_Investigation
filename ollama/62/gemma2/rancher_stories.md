The dust kicked up by Jebediah "Jeb" Claymore's boots settled like a fine grit on his weathered face as he surveyed his land. The sun, a molten disc bleeding into the horizon, cast long shadows across the parched fields of his West Texas ranch, "Redrock Haven."  A hawk circled lazily overhead, its cry piercing the stillness that followed the day's oppressive heat. Jeb ran a calloused hand over his bristly beard, his gaze lingering on a lone, withered cottonwood tree that stood sentinel at the edge of his pasture. It was a stark reminder of how unforgiving this land could be, how easily it could turn fertile ground to dust and dreams to despair.  But Jeb wasn't one for despair. He was a rancher, born and bred, with grit in his veins and loyalty in his heart. This land, this redrock haven, had been his family's for generations, and he intended to keep it thriving, even if it meant fighting tooth and nail against the drought that gripped their valley.
