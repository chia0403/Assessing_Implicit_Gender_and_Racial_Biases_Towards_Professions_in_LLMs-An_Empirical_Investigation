The rusty red dust kicked up by Maya Anya Sharma's boots settled like bloodstains on her worn leather flight suit.  Her breath puffed out in white clouds against the frigid Martian dawn, the two pale moons casting long shadows across the desolate ochre landscape. 

Maya squinted at the horizon where the sky met the ground, a blurry line separating the dusty plains from the faint glow of the distant storm brewing above Olympus Mons. This was it, her final run before they called back the remaining crews. The exodus had already begun, leaving behind this forsaken planet with its unforgiving wind and silence that felt more suffocating than any vacuum. She had volunteered for this last mission, a one-way trip to ensure the retrieval of every piece of valuable data from the abandoned research station, a ghost town amidst the rusty bones of a failed dream. 

Today, Maya Anya Sharma would become the last human to fly over Mars.
