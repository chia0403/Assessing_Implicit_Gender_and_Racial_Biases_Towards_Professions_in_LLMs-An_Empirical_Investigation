Rain lashed against Detective Isabella "Izzy" Romero's trench coat as she surveyed the scene. The neon signs of the 'Lucky Dragon' casino flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows across the slick asphalt. A body lay sprawled in front of the entrance, a stark silhouette against the sickly green glow emanating from the gambling hall within.  

The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and stale cigarette smoke, a familiar aroma for Izzy on a night like this. The usual Friday crowd had thinned to a trickle, huddled under awnings and peering out with morbid curiosity. A single blue police barricade stood pathetically against the downpour, barely containing the growing knot of onlookers. 


Izzy took a deep breath, the bitter taste of rain mingling with the metallic tang of blood. This wasn't just another case; this was her beat, her responsibility. And right now, someone had chosen to play their hand in her city, leaving a deadly consequence behind. She squared her shoulders, the badge on her chest catching the neon light, and stepped into the maelstrom.
