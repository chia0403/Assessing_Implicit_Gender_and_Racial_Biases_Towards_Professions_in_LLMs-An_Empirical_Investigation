Elara Bellweather surveyed her shop with a sigh. Petals clung to her worn floral apron like miniature confetti, remnants of a morning spent coaxing life from stubborn stems. Sunlight streamed through the dusty storefront window, illuminating motes dancing in the air, and casting long shadows across the rows of vibrant blooms.  

Her flower shop, "Blooming Hearts," nestled on a quaint corner in Willow Creek, was usually a symphony of fragrance and color. Today, however, it felt strangely muted, the usual buzz of customers replaced by an oppressive silence. The morning's delivery had been meager â€“ just a handful of roses and anemones, pale imitations of their usual vibrancy. Elara's brow furrowed. Willow Creek was known for its abundance, its gardens overflowing with blooms throughout the summer months. This sudden dearth of flora was unsettling, almost ominous.
