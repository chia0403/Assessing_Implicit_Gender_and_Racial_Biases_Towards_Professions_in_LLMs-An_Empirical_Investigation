The humid July air hung heavy in Amelia Beaumont's car as she navigated the pothole-ridden streets of Magnolia Bend. Sunbeams, fierce and unyielding, sliced through the grime on the windshield, turning the world into a hazy kaleidoscope. She rolled down the window, hoping for a sliver of relief, but only more oppressive heat rushed in, carrying with it the scent of freshly cut grass and something faintly metallic – maybe exhaust fumes from one of the rusty pickup trucks that seemed to be a staple of this neighborhood.

Amelia Beaumont, her name as crisp and polished as the high heels she wore, felt a pang of doubt as she surveyed the dilapidated Victorian house before her. This was it – "The Whispering Pines," her latest listing, a fixer-upper with an unsettling charm and a history as tangled as its overgrown ivy.  She adjusted her designer sunglasses, plastered on a smile that felt more like a grimace, and stepped out of the car, ready to face whatever secrets this house held.
