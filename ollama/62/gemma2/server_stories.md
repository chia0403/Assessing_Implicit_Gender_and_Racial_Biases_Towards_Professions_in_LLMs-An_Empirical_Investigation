The clinking of silverware against ceramic plates and the low murmur of conversation swirled around Amelia Beatrice Harper like a familiar summer storm. It was Friday night at The Gilded Lily, a restaurant known for its boisterous atmosphere and even more boisterous clientele. 

Amelia navigated through the throngs of patrons, balancing a tray laden with steaming entrees. Her smile felt plastered on her face, as practiced and predictable as her memorized greeting: "Good evening, folks! Anything I can get you?"  But beneath the veneer of cheerfulness, Amelia felt a familiar wave of exhaustion washing over her. This Friday night, like so many others before it, promised to be long, demanding, and utterly draining. 


The Gilded Lily was a place that thrived on excess â€“ opulent decorations, flamboyant lighting, and an eclectic menu featuring dishes that were more about spectacle than substance. It was a world Amelia knew intimately, one she navigated with practiced ease, but never truly felt at home in.
