The insistent buzz of clippers sliced through the humid air, punctuated by the rhythmic snip-snip of Vivienne "Viv" Beaumont's scissors. Her salon, "The Mane Attraction," nestled in the heart of New Orleans' vibrant French Quarter, hummed with life. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting a golden glow on Viv's fiery red hair. Jazz music pulsed from hidden speakers, its melody weaving itself into the symphony of salon sounds: the sizzle of curling irons, the gentle murmur of conversations, and the satisfied sighs of customers leaving with freshly coiffed masterpieces. 


Today, however, an unsettling quiet hung over The Mane Attraction. Viv's usually bustling salon was eerily empty, save for a single customer perched nervously in her chair â€“ a young woman with wide, haunted eyes and hair the color of storm clouds.  A shiver snaked down Viv's spine as she met the woman's gaze. There was something about her presence, something unsettling that tugged at Viv's intuition. Something whispered of secrets and shadows lurking just beneath the surface.
