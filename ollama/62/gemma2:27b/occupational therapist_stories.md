Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunnyside Rehabilitation Center, blurring the view of the manicured gardens outside. Inside, Emilia Rose Davies, a woman with eyes as warm as caramel and a smile that could disarm even the grumpiest patient, was battling a stubborn knot in her shoulder. She wasn't prone to tension headaches, but the last few weeks had been particularly trying.

Sunnyside, usually buzzing with activity and laughter, felt strangely subdued today.  The arrival of a new patient, Mr. Alistair Finch, a renowned architect who'd suffered a debilitating stroke, had thrown Emilia off kilter. Alistair, a man accustomed to commanding respect and controlling his environment, was now grappling with the most frustrating adversary: his own body. He resented his limitations, lashed out at his therapists, and refused to engage in any activity that felt "childish" or "beneath him."

Emilia knew this case would be challenging, but something about Alistair's sharp intelligence and hidden vulnerability sparked a fierce determination within her. She wouldn't let him give up. Today, however, as she struggled to loosen the tension in her shoulder, Emilia couldn't help but wonder if she was truly equipped to handle the storm brewing inside Sunnyside's walls.
