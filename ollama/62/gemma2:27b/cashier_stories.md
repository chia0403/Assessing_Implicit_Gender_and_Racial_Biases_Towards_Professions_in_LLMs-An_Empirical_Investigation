Rain lashed against the grimy storefront window, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into an abstract smear of pink and green. Inside, Eleanor Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging up the dusty glass partition separating her from the lone customer. The bell above the door chimed mournfully each time a gust of wind slammed it open, sending a shiver down Eleanor's spine.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the cluttered aisles crammed with everything from instant ramen to mothballs. It was 3:17 am, and the only sound besides the rain and the occasional rumble of thunder was the rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Eleanor's finger tapping against the chipped countertop. She'd been working the graveyard shift at Benny's Bargain Bazaar for five years, and she knew every creak of the floorboards, every flicker of the faulty neon sign, by heart.
