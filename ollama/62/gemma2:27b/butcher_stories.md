The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood, a scent Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood knew better than his own mother's perfume. Dawn had barely cracked the sky, painting the cobblestone streets outside his shop a bruised purple, when Teddy was already elbow-deep in the day's first carcass - a hefty Hampshire pig, its glazed eyes staring accusingly from beneath a tangle of pink intestines. His cleaver sang a sharp, rhythmic tune as he carved through muscle and bone, each precise movement honed by years spent plying his trade in the heart of Blackwood Market. The market, a bustling labyrinth of stalls hawking everything from freshly baked bread to exotic spices, was Teddy's domain. He knew every crack in the cobblestones, every vendor's gossip, every hidden nook where he could escape the relentless clamor for a moment of quiet contemplation. 

But today, something felt different. A prickling unease danced beneath his skin, a sense of foreboding as heavy as the pig carcass on his butcher block. The usual symphony of market sounds - hawkers' cries, clanging carts, chickens squawking - seemed muted, drowned out by an unsettling silence that crept into Teddy's bones. He paused, cleaver hovering mid-air, and listened intently. Then, a barely perceptible sound cut through the quiet - a low, guttural growl, unlike anything he'd ever heard before.
