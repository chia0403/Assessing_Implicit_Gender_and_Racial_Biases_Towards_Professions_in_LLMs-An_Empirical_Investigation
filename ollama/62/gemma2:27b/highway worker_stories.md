The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Ramirez's neck, turning his already tanned skin an alarming shade of crimson. Sweat stung his eyes as he maneuvered the jackhammer with practiced ease, pulverizing the cracked asphalt into a fine, gray dust that danced in the shimmering heatwaves.

He was miles from anywhere, smack-dab in the middle of the desolate stretch of Highway 93 that ran through the heart of the Sonoran Desert. The only sound besides the rhythmic thump of the jackhammer was the distant drone of cicadas and the occasional mournful cry of a hawk circling overhead. Eli squinted at the horizon, where the jagged peaks of the Superstition Mountains shimmered in the distance like a mirage.

Eli wasn't one for sentimentality, but even he had to admit the stark beauty of this unforgiving landscape held a certain allure. The desert was a harsh mistress, but it demanded respect and offered a quiet solitude that Eli craved.
