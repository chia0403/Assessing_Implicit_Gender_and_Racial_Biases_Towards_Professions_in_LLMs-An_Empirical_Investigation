The air hung thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth. A veil of morning mist clung to the towering Douglas firs, their branches heavy with dew. Silas Blackwood squinted through the haze, his calloused hand shading his eyes as he surveyed the sprawling forest before him. Sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy, dappled the mossy ground in a mosaic of gold and green. This was Silas' domain - a world of ancient trees, whispering wind, and the rhythmic thrum of saws. He was a logger, born and bred in these woods, his veins running with the sap of the forest itself.

Today, however, a tremor of unease ran through him. It wasn't the usual apprehension that came with tackling a particularly stubborn giant; this felt different. A cold wind, uncharacteristic for late summer, rustled the leaves overhead, carrying with it an unsettling silence, as if the forest itself were holding its breath. Silas tightened his grip on his axe, a familiar weight against his calloused palm. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, lurking just beyond the veil of mist, waiting for him to make the first move.
