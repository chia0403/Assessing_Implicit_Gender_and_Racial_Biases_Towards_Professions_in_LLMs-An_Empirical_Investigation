The desert wind whipped at Silas "Deacon" Blackwood's weathered face as he wrestled his eighteen-wheeler along Highway 95. The sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked asphalt, shimmering in waves that distorted the already blurry horizon. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling columns of ochre and brown against the endless blue sky. Deacon squinted, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. He was hauling a load of fresh produce from Yuma to Las Vegas – a run he knew by heart after decades on the road. But today, something felt different. A restlessness gnawed at him, a sense that something was about to change. Maybe it was the way the crows were circling overhead, their harsh caws echoing his own unease. 

He glanced at the dashboard clock – 3:17 PM. Just another hour or so until he'd hit Searchlight and could grab some lukewarm coffee and a greasy burger. But as he crested a rise in the road, a glint of metal caught his eye. Something lay half-buried in the sand just off the shoulder. It wasn't unusual to see debris littering this stretch of desolate highway, but this object had an unsettling shape – angular, almost...artificial.

Deacon's curiosity piqued, he eased his rig onto the narrow shoulder, the rumble of tires against gravel echoing through the stillness. He grabbed his trucker hat and stepped out into the baking sun, his boots sinking slightly in the loose sand.  As he approached the object, a cold shiver ran down his spine despite the heat. It was unlike anything he'd ever seen before...
