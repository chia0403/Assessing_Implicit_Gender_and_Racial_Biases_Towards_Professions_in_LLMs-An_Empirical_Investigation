The air in the cavernous drafting room hummed with the low drone of fluorescent lights reflecting off countless white drafting tables. Penelope "Penny" Cartwright hunched over her board, the scent of graphite and stale coffee filling her nostrils. Outside, Chicago's winter wind howled, a symphony of ice and discontent echoing through the skyscraper windows. Penny barely registered it. Her focus was laser-sharp on the intricate lines she was drawing, painstakingly recreating the blueprints for a new suspension bridge destined to span the tumultuous waters of Lake Michigan. 

Every stroke of her pencil, every calculated angle, felt like weaving a dream into reality. Yet, despite the satisfaction that came with crafting these architectural visions, a gnawing restlessness simmered beneath Penny's surface. The endless repetition of drafting, while precise and necessary, felt like a cage for her burgeoning imagination.
