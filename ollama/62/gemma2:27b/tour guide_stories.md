The humid Charleston air clung to Amelia Genevieve Beaumont like a damp shawl as she herded her gaggle of tourists across the cobblestone streets.  Sunlight glinted off the pastel-coloured houses that lined Rainbow Row, their charm momentarily dulled by the relentless summer heat. "Now, folks," Amelia chirped, her voice betraying none of the weariness she felt, "we're approaching one of Charleston's most historic homes: the Nathaniel Russell House." She pointed towards a stately Georgian mansion with intricate wrought-iron balconies and a sprawling garden. 

Amelia loved her job, truly she did. Sharing Charleston's history, its whispers of pirates and plantations, its tales of triumph and tragedy â€“ it was a privilege. But today, even the allure of history couldn't quite banish the nagging feeling that something was amiss. A shiver ran down Amelia's spine despite the heat, an unsettling premonition she couldn't shake.
