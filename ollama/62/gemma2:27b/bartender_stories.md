Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Tap, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, fried onions, and something vaguely floral, courtesy of Esme's latest attempt at "bringing some class" to the establishment.  Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez, her dark hair pulled back in a severe bun, was wiping down the already spotless mahogany bar, her movements economical and precise. The clock above the mirrored liquor shelf ticked towards midnight, the only sound besides the drumming rain and the occasional clink of glasses from the handful of regulars huddled in booths. 

Tonight, Esme felt it â€“ a change in the air. It wasn't just the storm brewing outside; there was an unsettling hum beneath the surface of the usual Friday night lull.  Something was coming. She could feel it in her bones.
