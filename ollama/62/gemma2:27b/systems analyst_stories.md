Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's cramped apartment, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his fingers flying across the keyboard. The city lights outside blurred into an impressionist painting, their neon glow refracting through the sheets of water. Inside, the only illumination came from the sickly green glow of Alistair's monitor, illuminating his weary face and casting elongated shadows across the cluttered room. Empty coffee mugs littered the desk, a testament to the hours he'd poured into this project - debugging a legacy system for the city's antiquated traffic management network.

Alistair was no stranger to late nights, but this one felt different. A gnawing sense of unease had settled in his gut, fueled by cryptic error messages and anomalies within the code that defied logic. He knew this system inside out; it was practically an extension of himself. Yet, something about this bug felt...off. Like a whisper from the shadows, hinting at something far deeper and more sinister lurking beneath the surface.
