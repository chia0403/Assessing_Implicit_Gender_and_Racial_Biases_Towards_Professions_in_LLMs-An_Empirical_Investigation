The air hung heavy with the scent of hay and disinfectant, a familiar comfort to Eloise Beatrice Finch. Sunlight, filtered through dusty panes, illuminated motes dancing in the cavernous barn. Outside, the rolling hills of Vermont shimmered under a summer sky, but within these weathered walls, time seemed to move at its own pace.  Eloise, her freckled nose dusted with hay, hummed softly as she meticulously cleaned the stall of Buttercup, a gentle mare with eyes as soft as melted chocolate. 

Buttercup nickered, nudging Eloise's hand with her velvety muzzle, and Eloise smiled, scratching behind her ears. "Don't worry, girl," she murmured, "you'll be back in the pasture soon enough."  But a knot of unease tightened in Eloise's stomach. Something wasn't right. The normally boisterous farm was strangely quiet. The usual symphony of clucking hens, bleating goats, and snorting pigs was replaced by an unsettling silence. 


Where was everyone?
