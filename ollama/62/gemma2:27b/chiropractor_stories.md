Rain lashed against the frosted glass windows of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, blurring the already muted colors of the autumn landscape beyond. The wind howled like a hungry wolf, rattling the metal sign that hung above her door â€“ "Sinclair Chiropractic: Where Alignment Meets Wellbeing."  Evelyn sighed, watching a particularly fat raindrop race down the pane.

Business had been slow lately, which wasn't unusual for this time of year in sleepy Willow Creek. The locals tended to hibernate until spring, contenting themselves with hot cocoa and crackling fireplaces. Still, Evelyn couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness as she straightened the framed anatomy chart hanging on the wall. She missed the bustle of her old practice in Chicago, the constant flow of patients seeking relief from their aches and pains.

Willow Creek had seemed like the perfect escape, a chance to slow down, reconnect with nature, and build something new. But after two years, she was starting to wonder if she'd made the right decision. Perhaps Willow Creek wasn't ready for a chiropractor who believed in more than just cracking bones. She yearned for patients who saw her practice as a haven for healing, not just a place to get their backs fixed. 

Suddenly, the insistent chime of the doorbell broke through her thoughts. Evelyn looked up, startled. Visitors were rare on days like this. A shiver ran down her spine. Was it a patient? Or something else entirely?
