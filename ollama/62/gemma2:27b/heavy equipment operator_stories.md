The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he maneuvered the massive Caterpillar excavator, its hydraulic arm groaning in protest as it scooped up another heaping load of dirt. Dust devils danced across the barren expanse of the Nevada desert, swirling around Eli's boots like miniature tornadoes. The air hummed with the rhythmic thrumming of the engine and the screech of metal on rock. This was Eli's domain â€“ a wasteland being transformed into a sprawling solar farm, one cubic yard of earth at a time. 

Eli wiped the sweat from his brow, squinting through the glare reflecting off the windshield. He loved the solitude of his work, the feeling of raw power coursing through the machine beneath him, and the satisfaction of shaping the land with his own hands. But today, something felt different. A restlessness prickled at the edges of his mind, a feeling he couldn't quite place. It was as if the desert itself were whispering secrets he couldn't hear.
