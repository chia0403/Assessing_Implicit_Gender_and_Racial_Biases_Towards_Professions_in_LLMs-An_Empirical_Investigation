The rusty bell above the door jingled its familiar tune as Eloise Ainsworth pushed it open, her boots crunching on the thin layer of frost covering the porch. A gust of wind whipped around her legs, carrying the scent of pine needles and woodsmoke. Dawn was just breaking over the snow-dusted peaks of the Cascade Range, casting long shadows across the sleepy town of Willow Creek. 

Eloise shivered, tugging her worn woolen coat tighter around her. Her breath formed white clouds in the frigid air as she surveyed her surroundings. The Willow Creek Animal Clinic, a quaint wooden building nestled amongst towering pines, seemed to sigh contentedly under the weight of the first snow. Eloise smiled. Home. It might not have been fancy, but it was hers, and for someone who'd spent most of their life drifting from one temporary gig to another, having roots felt like a miracle.
