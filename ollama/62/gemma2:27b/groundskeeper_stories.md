The scent of rosemary hung heavy in the air, mingled with the sharp tang of freshly cut grass. Elias Blackwood surveyed his handiwork with satisfaction. The sprawling lawns of Hawthorne Manor shimmered emerald green beneath the July sun. He ran a hand over the smooth bark of an ancient oak, its gnarled branches casting intricate shadows across the meticulously manicured rose garden.

Elias knew every inch of these grounds as intimately as he knew his own reflection. For twenty years, he had been the silent guardian of Hawthorne Manor, tending to its sprawling lawns, vibrant flowerbeds, and whispering willow groves. He was more than just a groundskeeper; he was a curator of beauty, a whisperer to the wind and earth.

But today, something felt different. The stillness was too profound, broken only by the distant chirping of cicadas. Even the roses seemed to hold their breath, their velvety petals quivering in anticipation. As Elias turned towards the manor house, its gothic silhouette looming against the azure sky, a shiver danced down his spine. Something wasn't right.
