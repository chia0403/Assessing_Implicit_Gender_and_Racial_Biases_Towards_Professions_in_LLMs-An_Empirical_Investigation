Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Prescriptions & Potions," blurring the neon sign into a sickly smear of green. Inside, Elara Montgomery, her auburn hair escaping its bun in damp strands, sighed as she counted out another bottle of ibuprofen. The incessant drumming of rain was starting to mirror the steady thrumming ache behind her own eyes. It had been a long day - a relentless stream of coughs, sniffles, and worried parents seeking miracle cures for childhood ailments.

Elara wasn't complaining, not really. She loved helping people, finding the right medication to ease their discomfort or offer a moment's respite from pain. But tonight, all she craved was the warmth of her tiny apartment, a steaming mug of chamomile tea, and the comforting silence of a good book.

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, breaking the monotonous rhythm of the rain. A figure stood silhouetted against the storm-lit street, his features obscured by the hood pulled low over his face. He paused for a moment, as if hesitating, before pushing open the door and stepping inside, bringing with him a gust of cold air and the sharp scent of wet earth.
