The aroma of warm vanilla and caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eloise Beatrice Cartwright's apron like a second skin. Outside her bakery window, the neon glow of the "Open" sign pulsed against the dusky indigo sky, casting flickering stripes across the flour-dusted countertop. 

Eloise hummed softly as she piped delicate buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake, each petal meticulously crafted and impossibly perfect. Her hands moved with practiced grace, years of experience honed into an almost balletic artistry. The bride had requested a cascade of cascading ivory roses down the side of the cake, mirroring the bouquet she would carry down the aisle tomorrow.

But tonight, Eloise's heart wasn't in it.  A sense of unease gnawed at her, a discordant note in the symphony of sweet smells and the gentle clinking of her tools. Something was off, a prickle on the back of her neck that whispered of trouble brewing.
