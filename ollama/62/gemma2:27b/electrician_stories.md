The insistent hum of fluorescent lights battled with the whirring of Elijah "Eli" Vance's drill as he wrestled with a stubborn junction box in the bowels of the abandoned textile mill. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight piercing through the grimy windows, illuminating cobwebs thick enough to snare small birds and rusted machinery frozen in mid-motion. The air hung heavy with the scent of decay and something else, something metallic that pricked at Eli's nostrils like ozone after a storm. 

Eli wiped sweat from his brow, cursing under his breath as the ancient wiring resisted his efforts. This renovation project was turning into a nightmare.  The city council had promised a straightforward rewiring job for the soon-to-be artist studios, but beneath the peeling paint and crumbling brickwork lurked a labyrinth of outdated circuitry, haphazardly spliced connections, and wires that looked more like frayed nerves than conduits of electricity.

He straightened up, his aching back protesting the unfamiliar angles he'd been contorting into for hours.  Just then, a floorboard creaked somewhere above him, followed by an unnerving silence. Eli paused, listening intently. The only sound was the drip-drip-drip of water seeping through a crack in the ceiling. He dismissed it as his imagination, the echoes playing tricks on him in this cavernous space.

But something felt off. An uneasy prickling sensation danced across his skin.  Eli grabbed his flashlight and cautiously moved towards the source of the sound, his boots echoing on the concrete floor. The shadows seemed deeper here, swallowing the light, and a cold draft snaked around his legs.
