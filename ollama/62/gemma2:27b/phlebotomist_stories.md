The flickering fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the sterile white walls of Mercy General Hospital’s blood draw center.  Eliza Cartwright adjusted her navy blue scrubs, the faint scent of antiseptic clinging to the fabric like a second skin. She was mid-sip from her lukewarm coffee when Mrs. Henderson shuffled in, her face pinched with anxiety. Eliza plastered on her practiced smile, a blend of warmth and professionalism honed over years drawing blood from everyone imaginable – terrified toddlers to stoic centenarians.

“Good morning, Mrs. Henderson,” Eliza chirped, gesturing towards the vinyl chair. “Ready to get this done?” 


The air hung heavy with the familiar metallic tang of fear and anticipation. Eliza took a deep breath, bracing herself for whatever story lay beneath Mrs. Henderson's worried frown. This was Mercy General, after all – where hope flickered alongside despair, and every blood draw held the potential for both revelation and heartbreak.
