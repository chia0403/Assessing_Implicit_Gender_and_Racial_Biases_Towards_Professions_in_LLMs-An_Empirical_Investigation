The scent of caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, a sweet shroud against the chill November wind whipping through the cobblestone streets of Prague. Emilia Novak sighed contentedly, wiping flour from her brow with the back of her hand. The early morning light filtered through the bakery window, casting long shadows across the rows of golden croissants and plump poppy seed rolls cooling on racks. Outside, the city was slowly awakening: the clatter of trams, the muffled voices of vendors setting up shop, the distant strains of a violin melody drifting from a nearby café. But Emilia's world was contained within the four walls of her bakery, "Pekárna Sladký Sen" – Sweet Dream Bakery. It was a world she had built with her own hands, kneading dough and mixing batter into a symphony of scents and flavors that brought joy to the city's weary souls. Today, however, Emilia's sweet reverie was disrupted by a sharp rapping at the door.
