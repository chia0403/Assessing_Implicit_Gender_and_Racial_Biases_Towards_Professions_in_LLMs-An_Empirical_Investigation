The acrid scent of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the stale perfume emanating from the outdated floral wallpaper. Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez adjusted her crimson lipstick in the reflection of the cracked vending machine, willing her nerves to settle. Today was crucial. This dusty, forgotten furniture showroom on the outskirts of Tulsa was her last chance to salvage this quarter's sales figures.

She glanced at the stack of brochures featuring plush velvet sofas and mahogany dining sets, their glossy promises a stark contrast to the reality of chipped wood and faded upholstery surrounding her. Esme took a deep breath. She could do this. After all, she wasn't just selling furniture; she was selling dreams. Dreams of cozy family dinners, laughter echoing around antique tables, and peaceful evenings curled up on luxurious sofas with a good book.

Suddenly, the bell above the showroom door jingled, announcing a customer. Esme straightened her blazer, plastering a bright smile onto her face as she turned to greet them. 

A tall, gaunt man with piercing blue eyes and a fedora pulled low over his forehead stepped inside, his presence immediately shifting the air in the room.  He scanned the showroom with a critical gaze, his lips pursed in disapproval. Esme braced herself; this one looked like he wouldn't be easily swayed.
