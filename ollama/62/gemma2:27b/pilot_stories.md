The rusty scent of aviation fuel hung thick in the air, mingling with the dry desert heat.  Above, the relentless sun beat down on the cracked tarmac of Oasis airstrip, turning the world into a shimmering haze. Elara "Lara" Vance ran a calloused hand over the faded paintwork of her Cessna 172, her gaze tracing the familiar lines and dents. She'd poured her heart and soul into this old bird, patching her up with salvaged parts and endless hours of tinkering.

Today was different. Today wasn't about hauling cargo or ferrying tourists across the sprawling Arizona desert. Today was about something far more personal. Lara squinted at the crumpled map spread on the dusty cockpit dashboard, tracing a route that snaked through canyons and ghost towns, leading to a forgotten airstrip marked only by a faded "X".  She was going home.
