The midday sun beat down on Silas Montgomery's neck as he meticulously hammered another shingle into place.  Below him, the city stretched out like a wrinkled tapestry, its vibrant chaos muted by the distance. From his perch atop Mrs. Goldstein's three-story brownstone, Silas could see everything: the bustling market stalls two blocks over, the lazy drift of pigeons in the park, and the distant gleam of the Hudson River reflecting the sapphire sky. He took a swig from his water bottle, the cool liquid a welcome respite from the heat radiating off the asphalt below.

Roofing wasn't glamorous work, but Silas wouldn't trade it for anything. There was a certain satisfaction in knowing he was protecting families and their homes, one shingle at a time. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up Silas's spine as he surveyed the cityscape.  It wasn't just the heat; there was an unnatural stillness to the air, a hushed expectancy that made the hairs on his arms stand on end. He shook it off, attributing the feeling to fatigue, but a nagging unease remained. Little did Silas know, the strange calm was about to be shattered by a storm unlike any he'd ever seen before.
