The flickering fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the cluttered office. Mountains of student transcripts threatened to engulf Amelia Rose Cartwright's mahogany desk, their paper edges brittle with age. Amelia sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. It was the end of another long day at Redwood High, where she served as head guidance counselor. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale coffee and teenage angst, a familiar perfume that clung to the beige walls like cobwebs.

Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns, painting the world in shades of orange and purple. But inside Amelia's office, it was always twilight â€“ a perpetual state of limbo between the anxieties of yesterday and the uncertainties of tomorrow. 


Today, however, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, an unspoken tension that hummed beneath the surface of the ordinary. It began with the arrival of a new student, Elijah Thorne, his face shrouded in shadows and his past a mystery. His file was barebones, devoid of any information beyond his name, age, and address.
