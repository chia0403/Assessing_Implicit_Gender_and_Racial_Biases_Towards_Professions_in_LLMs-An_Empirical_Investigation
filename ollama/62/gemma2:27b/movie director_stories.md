Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the abandoned theatre, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the silence within. Dust motes danced in the faint shafts of light that pierced the gloom through cracked glass panes, illuminating rows upon rows of dilapidated velvet seats.

This crumbling relic, forgotten by time and ignored by progress, would be the perfect backdrop for his film – a haunting exploration of lost dreams and the fragility of human connection, set against the backdrop of a city slowly succumbing to its own shadows.
