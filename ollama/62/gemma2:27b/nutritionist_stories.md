Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the vibrant mural of fruits and vegetables that adorned the storefront. Amelia Rosalind Chen, a petite woman with eyes as bright as the pomegranate seeds she often incorporated into her clients' meal plans, sighed. Business was slow. 

It wasn't the dreary Seattle weather keeping people away; it was the new "miracle cleanse" fad sweeping the city. Detox teas and juice fasts were all the rage, promising quick weight loss and a renewed sense of vitality. Amelia scoffed. These fads were nothing but glorified starvation diets, robbing people of essential nutrients and setting them up for a vicious cycle of yo-yo dieting.

A chime announced the arrival of a customer, breaking Amelia from her thoughts. She straightened her crisp white lab coat, plastered on her most encouraging smile, and turned towards the door. A young woman, hesitant and pale, stepped inside, clutching a tattered pamphlet advertising the "Ultimate Detox." This was going to be interesting.
