The clinking of silverware echoed through the cavernous dining room of "Chez Antoine," blending with the low murmur of conversation and the tinkling melody from the grand piano in the corner. The scent of garlic butter and roasting lamb hung heavy in the air, a tantalizing prelude to the culinary symphony about to unfold. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn braid bouncing with each step, navigated the maze of tables with practiced ease. She had been a server at Chez Antoine for two years, long enough to know every quirk of the establishment and its clientele. From the elderly Mrs. Dubois who always ordered the escargot to Mr. Henderson, the boisterous lawyer who insisted on extra peppercorns with his steak frites, Amelia knew them all.  Tonight, however, something felt different. An electric hum vibrated through the air, unseen but palpable. As she approached table six, a new reservation, her heart pounded in her chest, a strange premonition settling upon her like a fine mist.
