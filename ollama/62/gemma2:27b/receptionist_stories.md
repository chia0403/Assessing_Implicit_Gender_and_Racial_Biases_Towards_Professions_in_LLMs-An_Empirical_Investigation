The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of the Starlight Motel lobby.  Outside, the Nevada sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked asphalt parking lot, turning it into a shimmering mirage. Penelope "Penny" Rosebud, perched behind the chipped Formica reception desk, sighed dramatically. Another Tuesday afternoon, another parade of weary travelers and broken dreams shuffling through her domain. 

The Starlight was anything but starry. Its once vibrant neon sign now flickered erratically, casting an anemic glow on the faded turquoise facade. The pool out back, rumored to have been a sparkling oasis in its heyday, was now a stagnant pond teeming with mosquitos. Penny, with her fiery red hair perpetually pinned up in a messy bun and a permanent frown etched onto her freckled face, was the only constant glimmer of life in this tired old motel.
