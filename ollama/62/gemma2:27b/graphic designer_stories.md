The air in Eliza Cartwright's cramped studio apartment was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Empty ramen packets littered the counter, casualties of countless late nights spent hunched over her glowing iMac screen. Outside, the relentless roar of Brooklyn traffic provided a jarring soundtrack to her creative struggle. 

Eliza, a freelance graphic designer with dreams bigger than her meager budget allowed, was staring at a blank canvas on her screen – a website mockup for a sustainable clothing brand.  Inspiration, usually her constant companion, had deserted her. The deadline loomed like a storm cloud, and she knew that another all-nighter was unavoidable.

She needed something, anything, to spark her imagination. Maybe a walk would clear her head? Or a double espresso? Eliza chewed on her thumbnail, her eyes flitting between the empty canvas and the overflowing inbox of demanding clients.  It seemed everyone in the city needed a logo, a website, or a social media banner – right now.

But this project was different. It felt important. This wasn't just another faceless corporation; it was a small company trying to make a difference, and Eliza desperately wanted to help them succeed.
