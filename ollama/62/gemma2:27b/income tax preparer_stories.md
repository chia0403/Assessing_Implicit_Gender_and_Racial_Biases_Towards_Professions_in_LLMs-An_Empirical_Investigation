Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Beatrice "Bee" Cartwright's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store sign across the street. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation â€“ a familiar aroma this time of year. Bee sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she stared at the mountain of tax forms piled precariously on her desk. It was April 14th, and every soul in the neighborhood with even the slightest hint of financial instability seemed to have materialized in her doorway, clutching crumpled receipts and muttering about deductions they were "sure" they deserved.

Bee loved helping people navigate the labyrinthine world of taxes, but today, the weight of it all was pressing down on her.  The relentless drumbeat of rain mirrored the anxiety thrumming through her own veins. She had bills to pay, a leaky roof threatening imminent collapse, and a gnawing feeling that she was drowning in paperwork. Just then, the bell above the door tinkled, announcing another weary soul seeking refuge from the taxman's wrath. Bee plastered on her best "helpful accountant" smile and braced herself for the onslaught.
