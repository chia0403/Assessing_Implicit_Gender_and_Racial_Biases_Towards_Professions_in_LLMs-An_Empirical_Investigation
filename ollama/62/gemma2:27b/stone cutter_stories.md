The rasp of flint against granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of Thaddeus "Tad" Hawthorne's hammer. Sunlight, fractured by dusty skylights overhead, dappled the uneven floor in squares of gold. The air hung thick with the scent of dust and sweat, a familiar perfume to Tad's nostrils after decades spent honing his craft. 

He ran a calloused thumb along the edge of the half-finished gargoyle he was carving for the new cathedral spire. Its granite wings were still rough, but its face - a grotesque mockery of an angel, with bared fangs and bulging eyes - already possessed a chilling realism. Tad liked to think he imbued his creations with a bit of his own soul, a touch of melancholy and grit that mirrored the rugged landscapes of his homeland.  

But today, Tad felt a gnawing unease beneath his usual stoicism. A messenger had arrived earlier that morning, bearing a sealed scroll embossed with the crest of the King himself. The message inside was brief: "The Royal Architect requests your presence at the palace forthwith. Urgent matter." 


Tad knew this summons held significance beyond any ordinary commission. He'd carved for kings and queens before, but never had he been summoned directly by the palace. This time, it felt different â€“ a tremor in the granite foundations of his world.
