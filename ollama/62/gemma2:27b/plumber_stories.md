Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Agnes "Aggie" McTavish's ramshackle van. The wipers squeaked a mournful tune, barely keeping pace with the torrent. Aggie hunched over her toolbox, the faint scent of pipe dope and WD-40 battling for dominance in the cramped space. Outside, the neon sign of "Joe's Dive Bar" flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows on the slick asphalt. This was it – Aggie's destination after a double shift dealing with a clogged sewer line at Mrs. Higgins' bakery, followed by a burst pipe at the local bowling alley. 

Aggie sighed, rubbing her aching back. Joe's wasn't exactly known for its culinary delights, but it offered warmth, cheap beer, and the camaraderie of fellow working stiffs – all things Aggie desperately needed after a day like this.
