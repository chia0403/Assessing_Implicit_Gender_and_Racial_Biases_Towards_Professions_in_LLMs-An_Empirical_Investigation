Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunnyside Daycare, blurring the cheerful cartoon murals that adorned the walls. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Cartwright hummed along to "Wheels on the Bus" as she helped three-year-old Liam tie his shoes. Despite the dreary weather outside, a warm glow emanated from the room, fueled by the infectious laughter of toddlers building block towers and giggling over finger paints. But for Amelia, the storm mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. Today was Liam's last day at Sunnyside before he started pre-school, marking another milestone in his life that she wouldn't be a part of.

Amelia loved her job, adored the children, but lately, she'd been feeling adrift. The constant cycle of goodbyes and new beginnings was taking its toll. She yearned for something more permanent, a connection beyond finger paints and nap times. A flicker of hope ignited in her chest as she caught sight of a flyer pinned to the bulletin board: "Community Theatre Auditions â€“ All Ages Welcome." 



Could this be the spark she needed?
