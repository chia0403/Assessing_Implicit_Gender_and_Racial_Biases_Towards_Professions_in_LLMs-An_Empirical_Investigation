The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" diner cast an unsettling green hue across Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she pushed open the door. The smell of stale coffee and sizzling bacon assaulted her senses, mingling with the faint undercurrent of disinfectant that always seemed to cling to her like a second skin.

Eleanor was used to sterile, brightly lit offices, filled with the reassuring scent of lavender essential oil and soft instrumental music. This greasy spoon diner in the heart of downtown New Haven felt about as far removed from her usual clientele as one could get. Yet, here she was, on the trail of a patient who'd vanished into thin air three weeks ago, leaving behind only cryptic notes and a growing sense of dread in Eleanor's gut.
