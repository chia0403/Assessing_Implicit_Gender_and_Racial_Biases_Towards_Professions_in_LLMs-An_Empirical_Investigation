The sun beat down on Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez's weathered face as she surveyed her herd from atop a rocky knoll overlooking her ranch. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling up red earth like phantom cowboys. The air hung heavy and hot, thick with the smell of dry grass and cattle manure. Esme squinted at the horizon, her brow furrowed beneath the wide brim of her faded Stetson hat. A lone buzzard circled lazily overhead, its cry echoing across the vast expanse of the Arizona desert. Her gut twisted with unease. Something wasn't right.

Her cattle were restless, their lowing punctuated by the occasional sharp snort. They milled about nervously, their heads raised, scanning the landscape for something unseen. Esme had been ranching these lands for over twenty years, and she knew her herd like she knew the lines on her own hands. Their agitation was a warning sign, a primal fear that whispered of danger lurking in the shadows.
