Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the relentless drumming in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest.  The air hung thick with tension, punctuated by the sharp click of a pen against a worn notepad. Across from her sat Elias Thorne, a man whose vacant eyes and unnervingly calm demeanor clashed sharply with the brutal crime he was accused of committing. The stench of stale cigarette smoke mingled with something faintly metallic, making Eleanor's stomach churn.  

She adjusted her glasses, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose, and fixed Elias with a steady gaze. "Mr. Thorne," she began, her voice calm despite the roiling storm within her, "we need to understand what happened that night."


The setting: A dimly lit interrogation room in a bustling police precinct nestled in the heart of Chicago.
