The scent of cedar and sawdust hung heavy in the air, a familiar and comforting aroma to Elias Finch. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of his workshop, illuminating motes dancing in its path. Outside, the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith's hammer echoed across the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, a sleepy town nestled at the foot of the Whispering Woods. 

Elias ran a calloused hand along the smooth curve of a half-finished rocking chair, his brow furrowed in concentration. The wood, salvaged from an ancient oak felled by a recent storm, sang under his touch, whispering tales of sun and rain, wind and lightning. It was stubborn stuff, resisting his chisel with every stroke, but Elias relished the challenge. He saw not just wood, but potential; a haven for weary souls, a place to cradle dreams and soothe anxieties.

Today, however, Elias’s mind wasn't on the chair. A knot of anxiety tightened in his chest. The town messenger had arrived earlier that morning with unsettling news – rumors of strange lights flickering in the depths of the Whispering Woods, and whispers of shadowy figures haunting its paths.
