The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender shampoo and anticipation. Outside, the August sun beat down on Elm Street, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves. Inside "Curl Up & Dye," a small salon tucked between a bakery and a dusty bookstore, Emilia Blackwood deftly snipped at a client's unruly curls.  

Emilia wasn't just any hair cutter; she possessed a sixth sense when it came to transforming people. She could read their anxieties in the way they fidgeted with their phone, their hopes in the sparkle of their eyes as they envisioned their new look. Today, her client, a timid college student named Sarah, wanted a drastic change â€“ a vibrant blue pixie cut that screamed "confidence." 

As Emilia worked, she couldn't shake a feeling of unease. The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new customer, but instead of the usual cheerful greeting, a shiver ran down her spine. She glanced up, and her breath caught in her throat. Standing there, silhouetted against the bright sunlight, was a man she couldn't shake from her nightmares.
