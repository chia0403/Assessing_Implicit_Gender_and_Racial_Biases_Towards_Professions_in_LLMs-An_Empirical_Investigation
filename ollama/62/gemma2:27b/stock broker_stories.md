Outside, the relentless New York City symphony played – car horns blaring, sirens wailing, pedestrians shouting – a cacophony that mirrored the chaos inside Alistair’s head. He glanced at the ticker tape scrolling across his monitor, a dizzying stream of numbers that represented fortunes won and lost. Today, it seemed, more were lost than won.

"So," the woman across from him said, her voice sharp as shattered glass, "you're telling me I should hold onto this stock? Even though it's plummeting faster than Icarus?"
