The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony above Elara Finch as she wrestled a stubborn mop bucket down the echoing hallway of the Grand Blackwood Academy for the Arcane Arts. Moonlight spilled through the arched windows, casting elongated shadows that danced like phantoms across the polished marble floor. Dust motes pirouetted in the pale beams, each one a tiny, glittering universe.

Elara sighed, her breath fogging in the cool night air. She hated these late-night shifts. The silence was suffocating, broken only by the rhythmic swish of her mop and the occasional creak of the ancient building settling around her. It felt like she was the only living soul for miles, a ghost haunting the hallowed halls of learning where young mages honed their arcane abilities.  

Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced on the back of Elara's neck, a feeling of being watched. She paused, listening intently, her hand tightening around the mop handle. There it was again - a faint rustling sound coming from somewhere deeper within the academy.
