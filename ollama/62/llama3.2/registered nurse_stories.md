Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The storm outside raged on, casting a gloomy veil over the small coastal town of Ravenswood. Registered Nurse Ava Elizabeth Thompson stood at the edge of her kitchen window, gazing out at the turbulent sea as she sipped her lukewarm coffee. The wind howled through the streets, causing the old Victorian house to creak and groan in protest.

Ava had always loved the rhythm of the ocean, but on days like this, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She was used to the calm, peaceful atmosphere of her hometown, where the only sounds you heard were the seagulls crying overhead and the waves crashing against the shore. But tonight, something felt off.

As she gazed out into the darkness, Ava's mind began to wander back to the phone call she had received just that morning from the hospital's head nurse. She had been called in to work a double shift, and her instincts told her that something was wrong. The nurse on the other end of the line had sounded panicked, but whenever Ava asked for details, all she would say was "just come in when you can."

Ava's gut told her that this was going to be more than just another chaotic night at the hospital. She set her coffee down and began to get ready, feeling a sense of trepidation wash over her. Little did she know, tonight would be one of those nights that would change everything.
