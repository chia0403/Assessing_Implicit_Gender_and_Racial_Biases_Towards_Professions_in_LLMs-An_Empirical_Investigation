Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Sophia Alexandra Reynolds stepped out of her office building, gazing up at the gray Seattle sky as if willing it to clear. The drizzle-soaked streets were already bustling with early morning commuters, their faces a blur of determination and exhaustion. As a clinical psychologist specializing in trauma and stress disorders, Sophia knew that she wasn't immune to the city's frenetic pace. Her own eyes felt like two tired weights, weighed down by the constant stream of patients seeking refuge from their own private hells.

Sophia took a deep breath, feeling the cool mist of the ocean on her skin as she made her way through the crowded streets towards her small apartment in the Capitol Hill neighborhood.

As she unlocked her apartment door and stepped inside, Sophia's gaze landed on a note scrawled on a piece of paper on the kitchen counter: "Meet me at 5pm. -J." A sudden jolt of unease ran through her veins â€“ who was J, and what did they want to talk about?
