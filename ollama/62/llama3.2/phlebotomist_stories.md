Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The fluorescent lights above the lab seemed to hum in sync with the steady beat of Emily Anne Thompson's heart as she prepared for another long day of drawing blood from her patients. As a certified phlebotomist at the rural community hospital, Emily had seen it all - the anxious kids on their way to get shots, the elderly couples holding hands through the pain of an IV, and even the occasional rowdy teenager who thought they could outsmart her by hiding their veins.

But despite the routine nature of her work, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It had been a slow month for new patients, and the ones that did come in seemed to be... different. There was an undercurrent of tension in the air, like everyone was waiting for something - or someone - to make their move.

As she donned her favorite pair of worn-in scrubs and grabbed her trusty phlebotomy kit, Emily gazed out the window at the small town of Oakdale, where the hospital was the only major medical facility. The sun was just starting to rise over the horizon, casting a golden glow over the rows of tidy suburban homes and bustling streets.

It was going to be a long day.
