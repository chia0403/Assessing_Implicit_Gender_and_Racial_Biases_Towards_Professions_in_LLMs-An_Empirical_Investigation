In the wings, Director Emilia Sophia Patel adjusted her glasses and took a deep breath, ready to face another night of rehearsals for her latest production: a haunting adaptation of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream".

The 32-year-old director had spent years honing her craft in the theater world, from working behind the scenes on low-budget indie films to directing student productions at university.
