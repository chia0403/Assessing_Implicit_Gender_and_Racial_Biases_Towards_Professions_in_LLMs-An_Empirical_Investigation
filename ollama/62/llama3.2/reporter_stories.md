Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these. The gray sky seemed to press down on the city like a physical weight, draining the color from even the brightest lights. It was a fitting backdrop for reporter Emilia Victoria "Evie" Rodriguez as she stood outside the dilapidated apartment building where her source had agreed to meet.

At 32, Evie had already made a name for herself in the Seattle journalism scene with her dogged determination and unwavering commitment to uncovering the truth. Her latest investigation into corruption within the city's police department had put her at odds with some powerful figures, but she refused to back down. Tonight was no exception.

As she adjusted her raincoat and pulled out a cigarette (a habit she'd been trying to kick for months), Evie gazed up at the building's peeling facade, adorned with a flickering neon sign that read "Madison Apartments." The address matched the one her source had given her - but a quick scan of the surveillance footage on her phone revealed something else: a suspicious individual lurking in the shadows just hours before.

Evie's gut told her something was off. She tucked her phone away and took a long drag on her cigarette, blowing out a stream of smoke into the damp air as she waited for the appointed time to arrive. Little did she know, this meeting would change everything.
