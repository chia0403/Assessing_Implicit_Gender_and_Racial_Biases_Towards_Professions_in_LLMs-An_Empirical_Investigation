The warm glow of sunset streamed through the windows of Serenity Massage, casting a golden light on the serene atmosphere within. The soft hum of gentle music and the occasional sigh of relaxation drifted through the air, accompanied by the soothing scent of essential oils. It was just another evening at the cozy massage parlor in downtown Willow Creek, a tranquil oasis nestled among the bustling shops and cafes.

Ava Mae Thompson, a licensed massage therapist with a warm smile and skilled hands, was busy preparing for her final appointment of the day. Her long, curly brown hair was tied back in a loose ponytail, revealing a constellation of freckles across her cheeks that seemed to glow in the fading light. As she expertly applied a soothing blend of peppermint and lavender oils to her client's skin, Ava's mind began to wander to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing her lately.

As she gently guided her client into a state of deep relaxation, Ava's eyes scanned the dimly lit parlor, searching for any signs of disturbance. But all seemed quiet – until, just as she was about to begin the massage, a faint chill ran down her spine, and she couldn't help but wonder: what was waiting for her in the shadows?
