Here's a potential story opening:

---

The scent of bay rum and sandalwood wafted through the air as Azizi "Zee" Thompson carefully sectioned off a lock of curly brown hair from her latest client. It was a warm summer afternoon in August, and Zee was working at the small barbershop she'd inherited from her great-uncle, a legendary barber in their small hometown of Cuttyhunk, Massachusetts.

The sun beat down on the wooden floorboards of the shop, casting a golden glow over the rows of vintage barber chairs and faded photographs of old sailors and fishermen. Zee's own father, a retired fisherman with a wild shock of white hair, sat quietly in one of the chairs, watching as she worked her magic with the scissors.

The sound of seagulls cried out from outside, mingling with the hum of the shop's old air conditioning unit. It was just another typical summer day on Cuttyhunk Island, where time seemed to stand still and everyone knew each other's names. Zee loved it here, where she could cut hair and make people feel like kings, all while keeping the secrets that came with living in a small town.

But as she finished up the last snip of hair and handed her client his mirror, a sense of unease began to creep over her. Something was off, something that Zee couldn't quite put her finger on. And it wasn't just the feeling of being watched by her father's piercing blue eyes, which always seemed to see right through her.
