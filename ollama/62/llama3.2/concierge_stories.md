Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Paris gleamed like polished onyx under the faint moonlight, as if the city itself was trying to wash away the memories that lingered in every corner. It was a night like any other at Le Grand Hotel, where Aurora "Rory" Dupont, concierge extraordinaire, stood watch behind the sleek marble counter of her domain.

Aurora's dark hair was pulled back into a tight knot, revealing a smattering of freckles across the bridge of her nose as she scrutinized the guest list for the night. A discreet smile played on her lips as she checked off names – the Smiths, celebrating their anniversary; the Fourniers, honeymooning for the first time; and the reclusive billionaire, Monsieur Laurent, who required an extra measure of discretion.

Rory's own life was a carefully calibrated balancing act – one that kept her firmly entrenched behind the hotel's façade. But as she poured herself a cup of steaming coffee from the thermos on her desk, her eyes strayed to the note on her phone: "Meet me at 2 am. Come alone."

A flutter in her chest betrayed her attempt at nonchalance. It was unlikely that anyone knew Rory's true life – the one she kept hidden behind the hotel's opulent facades – but the text from an unknown number sent a shiver down her spine.
