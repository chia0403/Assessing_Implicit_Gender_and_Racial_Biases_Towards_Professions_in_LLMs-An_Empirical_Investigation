Here's a potential story opening:

---

The fog swirled through the streets of Ashwood, shrouding the old Victorian town in a damp, grey mist. Inside the musty walls of the Ashwood Public Library, Emilia Fothergill stirred the ashes of yesterday's fires and began to tidy up the shelves, her fingers tracing the spines of the books with a practiced ease that came from years of working among them.

As she worked, Emilia's mind wandered back to the strange occurrence that had brought her to this small town in search of answers. It had been three months since she'd received a letter, addressed to her at the old family estate, inviting her to take up a position as librarian in Ashwood. The letter had been unsigned, but the words themselves had felt like a summons from an old friend.

Now, as she delved deeper into the stacks, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this new town and its people. She'd found the residents to be friendly enough, if a bit reserved, and the library itself was a treasure trove of knowledge and history. Yet, there was an undercurrent to Ashwood's tranquility that seemed to be waiting for her to uncover.

As she reached the end of the row of shelves and began to sweep up the dust bunnies, Emilia's gaze caught on something strange: a book with her own name embossed on its cover. The title page was blank, except for a single word: "Welcome."
