Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Savannah gleamed like polished stone in the faint light of dawn, as if the city itself was trying to wash away the secrets of its storied past. Inside the cramped, smoke-filled office of Bayshore Insurance Agency, the sound of dripping water and distant foghorns created a symphony of melancholy that had become all too familiar to insurance agent, Julian Alexander Wynter III.

Julian, or Jules as he was known to his clients, had spent years navigating the labyrinthine world of claims and policyholders in this ancient city. His father, a Savannah native and retired army veteran, had founded the agency decades ago, and Julian had followed in his footsteps, determined to make a name for himself in the cutthroat world of insurance sales.

As he sipped his lukewarm coffee and gazed out the rain-streaked window, Jules couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It was as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for some long-dormant catastrophe to unleash a maelstrom of chaos upon its unsuspecting citizens. Little did he know, the storm was coming â€“ and it would blow through his life like a Category 5 hurricane.
