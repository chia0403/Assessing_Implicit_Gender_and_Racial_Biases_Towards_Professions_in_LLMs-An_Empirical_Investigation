Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The neon lights of the city's underbelly cast a gaudy glow over the rundown hotel, its faded sign creaking in the gentle breeze like an old man's sigh. Inside, the lobby was a dimly lit cave, its walls adorned with peeling wallpaper and a faded carpet that seemed to swallow the sound of footsteps whole. This was the Redwood Hotel, a place where dreams went to die and fortunes were made in secret.

Among the hotel's worn linoleum floors, one figure moved with the precision of a cat stalking prey. His name was Edwin Fletcher Pritchard III, or Eddie to those who knew him, but his coworkers called him "Eddie the Bellhop" due to his lightning-fast reflexes and uncanny ability to deliver luggage to rooms before anyone could say "please." With a mop of messy brown hair and eyes that seemed to hold a thousand secrets, Eddie navigated the hotel's labyrinthine corridors with an air of quiet confidence.

As he gathered the day's last handful of bags from the lobby, Eddie's gaze drifted towards the back door, where a chill wind whispered rumors of a mysterious guest who had checked in under the pseudonym "Mr. Smith." The whispers spoke of opulence and extravagance, but also of a darkness that lurked beneath the surface of even the most luxurious of hotels. And for some reason, Eddie felt an inexplicable pull towards this enigmatic stranger.

Little did he know, his life was about to take a drastic turn, one that would leave him questioning everything he thought he knew about himself and the world around him...
