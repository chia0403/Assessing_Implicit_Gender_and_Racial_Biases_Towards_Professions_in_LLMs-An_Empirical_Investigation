Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn morning in the sleepy town of Ravenswood, where the misty dawn rolled in off the river like a damp blanket. The streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to get to work or school before the day got underway. In a small, worn-down office building on Elm Street, 32-year-old Emmett "Em" Thompson was already up and getting ready for his shift as a janitor.

Em had been working at Ravenswood Elementary School for five years, quietly keeping the floors clean, the trash cans empty, and the toilets sparkling. It wasn't the most glamorous job, but Em liked the routine of it all – the predictable rhythms of the day, the quiet conversations with the teachers during their lunch breaks, and the sense of satisfaction he got from watching the students' faces light up when they saw him pushing his cart of cleaning supplies through the halls.

As he made his way to the staff room to grab a cup of stale coffee and check his schedule for the day, Em couldn't help but feel a twinge of restlessness. Something about this morning felt off – maybe it was the eerie fog that clung to everything like a damp shroud, or maybe it was just the sense that today would be different from all the others.

Whatever it was, Em was ready for whatever came next. After all, he'd been taking care of Ravenswood Elementary School for long enough to know its quirks and rhythms better than anyone else. Little did he know, however, that today was about to bring more excitement – and danger – than he ever could have imagined.
