Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

The sun was setting over the bustling streets of Manhattan, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers of New York City. In a small studio apartment nestled in the heart of Greenwich Village, a young woman named Alexandra "Alex" Thompson prepared for another long day ahead as a registered dietitian at a prestigious hospital.

As she expertly chopped fresh vegetables for tonight's dinner, Alex couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. Her phone had been blowing up with texts and calls from her best friend and colleague, Emily, who worked on the hospital's nutrition department just down the hall. The messages were cryptic, but one phrase kept repeating itself: "Meet me at the rooftop bar at 5 pm. Come alone."

Alex's mind began to wander as she saut√©ed the vegetables in a sizzling skillet. What could Emily want to discuss that was so urgent? And why the secrecy? As a dietician specializing in weight management and chronic disease prevention, Alex had seen her fair share of hospital politics and gossip, but this felt different. This felt like something more.

Just then, her stomach growled, reminding her that it was almost time for lunch. She carefully portioned out her chopped veggies into a small bowl and added a sprinkle of feta cheese - a snack fit for a queen (or at least a registered dietitian on the go). As she took a bite, Alex couldn't help but feel a thrill of anticipation mixed with a dash of unease. What lay ahead that would change the course of her life forever?
