Here's a potential story opening and setting for a mystery or thriller novel:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Emily Alexandra Reed, a sharp-witted and fiercely dedicated lawyer, stepped out of her office building and onto the wet pavement. It was just after 5 PM on a typical Wednesday evening in March, but Emily's mind was already racing with thoughts of the upcoming trial, one that could potentially make or break her career.

As she hailed a taxi to take her back to her modest apartment in Capitol Hill, Emily couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been building inside her all day. She had received an anonymous letter earlier that morning, containing only two cryptic words: "Look again." The message seemed insignificant on its own, but combined with a recent string of seemingly unrelated events at the law firm where she worked, Emily's gut was telling her that something much bigger was brewing.

The taxi screeched to a halt in front of Emily's apartment building, and she paid the driver before dashing inside to grab her coat. As she trudged up the stairs, the sound of raindrops pattering against the pavement below seemed to grow louder, like a whispered warning that only she could hear.

Emily reached her apartment door and fumbled for her keys, her mind whirling with questions about what lay ahead. What was behind those enigmatic words? And why did they seem so linked to her own life's work? The answer, much like the mysterious sender of the letter, remained shrouded in mystery â€“ but Emily was ready to dig deeper.
