Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this. The fog rolled in off the river, shrouding the crumbling Victorian houses and narrow alleys in a damp, impenetrable mist. It was the kind of night that made you want to stay indoors with a good book, or in Emilia Wystan's case, a stack of dusty ledgers.

As she hunched over her desk, the soft glow of the streetlights casting eerie shadows on the walls, Emilia felt a sense of comfort wash over her. She was a bookkeeper, and this small office above the bakery on Main Street was her sanctuary. The smell of fresh bread wafting up from below was always a welcome distraction from the quiet despair that often settled over her.

Emilia's eyes narrowed as she scanned the latest batch of invoices from the local hardware store. The numbers didn't add up, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She rubbed her tired eyes, trying to clear the haze of fatigue that had been plaguing her all day. But as she looked out into the rain-soaked night, she knew she wouldn't be able to shake it so easily.

This is just a starting point, and you can feel free to modify or discard it as you see fit!
