The dusty aroma of aged paper and stale coffee hung in the air like a shroud over Amelia's office.  Sunlight slanted through the grime-coated window, illuminating motes dancing in its beams, much like the tiny anxieties swirling in her stomach. Amelia was not usually one for anxiety; she’d been running a tidy, efficient bookkeeping practice for twenty years in this very corner of the city. But today felt different. Today, her usual calm had been knocked askew by a single, terrifying word: "foreclosure." 

**Setting:**  A small, cluttered office nestled in an older part of Chicago's historic downtown. The walls are lined with filing cabinets that seem to hum with forgotten memories.  The furniture is mostly vintage and worn - a testament to Amelia's own patient years spent nurturing this practice. There are stacks of files, each bearing the name of a client: Ms. Johnson’s flower shop, Mr. Peterson’s antique store, Mrs. Garcia’s struggling bakery, all etched in faded ink on the top corner.  Outside, the city bustles with its usual energy, but inside, Amelia is caught in a silent storm of paperwork and worry.


**Main character:** Amelia "Amy" Evans
