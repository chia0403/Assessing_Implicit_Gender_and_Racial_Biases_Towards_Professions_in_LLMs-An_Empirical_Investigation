The incessant drip-drip-drip was the soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life. For nearly 20 years, he'd been chasing that metallic symphony, his wrench a constant companion in the vast, echoing labyrinth of pipes and drains beneath the city. Elias was no stranger to grime or greasy hands; his calloused fingers had built their own language of understanding on the canvas of rusted pipes and leaking sinks. Heâ€™d become as familiar with the hidden pulse of water supply lines as he was with the rhythms of his heart. 

Today's mission, however, was anything but routine. The symphony was now a cacophony of sputtering alarms and frantic whispers - the old Victorian mansion on Elmwood Street had called in a "plumber for emergencies." Elias rubbed his tired eyes as he navigated the narrow hallway choked with overflowing dustbins and moth-eaten furniture. It was a scene straight out of a gothic novel, the air thick with an oppressive silence punctuated by the clanging of metal against metal and the ever-present drip.
