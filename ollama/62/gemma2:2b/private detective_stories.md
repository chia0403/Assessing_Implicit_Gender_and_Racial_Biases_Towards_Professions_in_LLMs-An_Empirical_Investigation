The rain hammered against Detective Elias Thorne’s trench coat as he surveyed the scene. Neon reflections danced in his eyes, blurring the already hazy street lights. The air hung thick with the stench of cheap liquor and desperation.  Across from him, huddled under the flimsy awning of a run-down diner, sat a figure draped in shadows.  His name was Silas Blackwood, a man Elias knew better by reputation than by sight – an enigma wrapped in smoke and secrets.

"The case," Blackwood rasped, his voice barely audible above the relentless downpour. "It's personal." 

Thorne had no time for riddles. Not with the city’s underbelly breathing down his neck like a pack of hungry wolves. He shifted his fedora, its brim casting an arc of darkness across his face. “And you want me to handle it?” 

Blackwood’s eyes glinted in the dimness. "I need someone who knows their way around this kind of darkness." He pulled out a crumpled business card – a picture of a raven perched on a skull. "My past is a tangled mess, Detective Thorne. And your skills are precisely what I require to untangle it.” 


**Setting:**  A grimy alleyway in the heart of New Jersey City - a melting pot of illegal enterprises, where secrets fester like refuse and the city’s underbelly thrived in the shadows.
