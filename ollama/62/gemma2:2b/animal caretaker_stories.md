The salty wind whipped through Amelia 'Amy' Finch's chestnut braids as she stared out at the endless expanse of grey sky and churning ocean.  Her island home was a tapestry woven from emerald green hills that tumbled down to sapphire beaches, but today even its usual serenity seemed washed clean by the relentless storm brewing overhead.

For months, Amy had cared for them all, tending their wounds and coaxing them back to health. Today, however, the storm seemed different. The sea churned with unnatural fury, and an oppressive weight pressed down on her chest. This was no ordinary weather; this was a kind of foreboding she hadn't felt in years.
