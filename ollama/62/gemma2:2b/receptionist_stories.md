The fluorescent lights hummed like angry bees trapped in a cage. Amelia "Amy" Carter ran a weary hand through her already frizzy brown hair, ignoring the incessant buzzing coming from the reception desk's old, cracked radio.  It was 8:01 AM, and already the day seemed to be leaning heavily on its heels, promising an endless stream of paperwork and irate customers in the stifling air of "Carter & Sons Inc.". The company was a family business - a monumentally archaic paper trail factory nestled in a forgotten corner of New England. 

Amy's world was largely defined by filing cabinets overflowing with forms and the constant barrage of calls from disgruntled clients. She lived for the quiet moments, when she could steal a few minutes in the back office to read an old paperback copy of Jane Eyre or dream about escaping the confines of her mundane life.  The only solace was her worn copy of "Pride & Prejudice" tucked away amongst the filing folders and that's where her eyes landed on the familiar cover; a crimson-painted rose against a background of soft, blue-grey paper, a silent reminder of home. 

But home felt miles away today. The faint scent of lavender and old coffee still lingering from yesterdayâ€™s long shift did little to soothe the growing unease that settled in her stomach.  The clock ticked relentlessly on its metal gears - 8:05 AM. Today wouldn't be just another day at the office. Something felt off, something was different. Amy could feel it in the way the air hung heavy with an unspoken dread and a strange new stillness had replaced the usual cacophony of customer complaints.
