## The Bloodletting

**Setting:** A bustling city hospital in the late 1920s, New York City. Rain lashed against the steel and glass facade of the building, creating a rhythmic counterpoint to the hushed murmurs and beeping monitors inside. The air was thick with disinfectant and the faint scent of old blood.  


**Character:** Evelyn Hayes - known affectionately by her patients as "Eve" - wasn't your average phlebotomist. With fingers like delicate spiderwebs and eyes that held a wisdom beyond her years, she treated each vein like an ancient map leading to forgotten histories. Her work was not merely draining blood; it was revealing the secrets of souls.  


**Opening:** 
A thin film of rain slicked the pavement outside the main entrance as Eve adjusted her cap, its brim casting a shadow over her piercing blue eyes. Inside, Mrs. Peterson's weary face awaited her, her pale hand clutched tight in hers. "Tell me again," Evelyn murmured, her voice barely above a whisper. 

"It just…doesn't feel right anymore," Mrs. Peterson sighed, the sound echoing through the sterile room like a cracked bell.  
 
Evelyn drew a deep breath before leaning forward, her touch light as she began to prepare for the task at hand. "Right." She said, gently tracing a line on Mrs. Peterson’s arm, her eyes scanning the map of veins etched onto the skin beneath her gloves. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic hiss of the blood-pumping machine in the corner, an almost mournful soundtrack to the day's struggles. 


Evelyn felt the weight of countless stories pressed against her fingertips, each patient a canvas for their own unique tragedies and triumphs. And she knew that even the smallest drop of blood could unravel the most intricate secrets.
