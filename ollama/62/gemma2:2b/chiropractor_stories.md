##  The Chiropractor and The Clocktower 

**Setting:** A cobblestone alleyway in Prague, under the looming shadow of an old clock tower that chimes every hour with the somber clang of time's passing. Rain drizzled down from the chipped stone archways, catching on cobblestones slick with the residue of yesterday's snowmelt. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia "Amy" Kozlov.  Her office was tucked into this forgotten alley, accessed only through a weathered wooden door hidden behind an old laundry basket chained to the wall. A single brass lamp cast an unsettlingly dim glow on her cluttered space: books of ancient osteopathy and posters advertising chiropractor treatments for everything from stress to back pain. 

**Story Opening:** 
"Another one bites the dust," Amy muttered, adjusting a worn book titled "The Fascia-Driven Cure". The clock's chime resonated through the alley, a familiar beat to her daily rhythm. Each hour brought a new case - each with their own story etched on their faces and a knot in their soul. 

But tonight, something felt different. An unfamiliar weight hung over Amy, heavier than the damp cloak she wore, thicker than even the accumulated years of practice etched into her face. Her usual calm had been replaced by an anxious hum that buzzed beneath the surface. Tonight, it wasn't just a patient's ailment; it was something... bigger. Something echoing the unseen rhythm of Prague's old heart. 


What will be Amy's next move? What is she dealing with?
