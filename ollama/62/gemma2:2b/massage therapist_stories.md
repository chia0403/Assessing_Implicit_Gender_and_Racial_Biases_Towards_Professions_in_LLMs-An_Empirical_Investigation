## The Scent of Eucalyptus and Regret

Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa, each drop echoing like a silent drumbeat in the quiet room. Inside, Amelia Wright, known throughout her neighborhood as "Ellie," sat massaging the tense shoulders of Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose every word seemed steeped in unspoken worry. Ellie’s fingers danced over Mrs. Henderson’s back, coaxing knots out with the measured strokes she’d learned from years of practice. The air was thick with lavender and eucalyptus oil, the scent always grounding for both client and therapist. 

But lately, even the calming aroma couldn't dispel the unsettling weight in Ellie’s own chest.  It had been three months since her husband, Daniel, had disappeared, leaving a gaping hole where his laughter once filled their home. The police deemed it a simple disappearance, but Ellie felt like she was trapped in a storm cloud of unanswered questions. The case was officially closed, but the nagging doubts and a growing sense of desperation simmered beneath the surface of every massage session, making her feel more isolated than ever before. 

As Mrs. Henderson sighed contentedly at the end of her session, Ellie knew this rain, like her husband's absence, would never truly recede.  She just hoped to weather it, one slow, measured knead at a time.
