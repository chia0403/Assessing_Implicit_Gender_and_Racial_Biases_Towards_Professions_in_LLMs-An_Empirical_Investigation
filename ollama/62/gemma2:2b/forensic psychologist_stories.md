## Opening:

The smell hit Dr. Eleanor Vance first -  a pungent mix of stale urine and something vaguely floral that reminded her uncomfortably of mothballs. She pushed open the heavy oak door to the interrogation room and surveyed the scene.  Across from her, sat Silas "Spike" Mallory, a man whose weathered face seemed etched with years of hard living and unspoken regrets. His eyes – a startling shade of jade green – were fixed on the floor, unnaturally still as if a bird trapped in a cage was slowly draining its life force. 

Eleanor took a deep breath, trying to quell the anxiety rising like bile in her throat. She had been called in for a second opinion - Spike's initial interview with standard police procedure had yielded more questions than answers. The evidence pointed to something... else. Something deeply personal, something that went beyond the surface level of his crimes. A life buried under layers of deception and violence, waiting to be unraveled.

**Setting:**  The interrogation room was a stark contrast to Spike's persona: a sparsely furnished box with fluorescent lights that hummed relentlessly above its worn-out carpet. The air hung heavy with the weight of untold stories and unspoken confessions. The only solace came from the faint scent of lavender emanating from a single old-fashioned desk lamp, the only piece of furniture in the room besides Spike's chair, which seemed to absorb any light that dared to fall upon it.


**Main Character:**  Dr. Eleanor Vance
