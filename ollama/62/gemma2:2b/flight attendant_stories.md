The humid air hung heavy in the cabin of Air Force One, clinging to Seraphina "Sera" Bell's skin like damp silk as she walked past the President's private quarters. The hum of the plane thrummed beneath her worn, red-and-black leather flight attendant shoes, a symphony she knew by heart.  Even with years of experience, Sera couldn't quite shake off the feeling that this was different: not just another presidential trip to a foreign country, but something far moreâ€¦ significant. 

It wasn't just the President's unusually serious demeanor on the phone in the Oval Office or the way his eyes seemed to follow her every move, though those weren't exactly uncommon for a president with an international agenda. It was the palpable tension that had overtaken the usually jovial atmosphere of Air Force One; even the normally boisterous chatter from the crew felt muted, hushed.  

Sera adjusted her headset, taking a deep breath and trying to focus on the task at hand: "Checking on your next course." A small smile played across President Taylor's lips as he looked up, his gaze lingering on hers for a moment longer than necessary before he turned back to address his advisors.
