## Story Opening:

The rhythmic click-clack of Amelia's heels echoed in the sterile white hallway, each step echoing through the silent rehab center like a whispered confession.  It wasn't easy to maintain her usual upbeat smile today; the air hung thick with a palpable tension she was unable to shake. The weight of another failed intervention, yet another family grappling with the aftermath of their loved one's struggle, settled heavily on her shoulders. 

The setting: St. John's Rehabilitation Center, nestled in the heart of Chicago. It boasted state-of-the-art equipment and a team of dedicated therapists, yet the patients' stories rarely felt like anything but a tragic symphony playing on repeat. Amelia was one of the few who truly understood the discordant notes; she'd spent her career navigating this landscape, helping families find their rhythm in the face of chaos. 

Her patient for today, Mr. Miller - a stoic, retired carpenter with calloused hands and eyes that held the weariness of years - sat slumped on the examination chair, his gaze fixed upon the swirling patterns painted across the carpet.  The click-clacking of her shoes continued as she approached, its tempo mirroring her anxious heart.
