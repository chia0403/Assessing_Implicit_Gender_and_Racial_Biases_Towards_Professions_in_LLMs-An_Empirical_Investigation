Rain hammered against the worn asphalt of Elm Street like tiny fists pounding on an old man's chest. Officer Elias "Eli" Grant hunched deeper into his trench coat, squinting at the deluge through the greasy windshield of his cruiser.  The neon lights reflecting off the puddles painted a sickly green sheen across the street, further blurring the already-dim scene. The usual Tuesday night rush hour had become a frantic dance with broken glass and screaming tires. Tonight felt different though. There was a palpable tension hanging in the air, thick enough to choke on.

Eli pulled his cap lower over his forehead as he reached for the radio transmitter.  "Dispatch, this is Grant. Any intel on what's going down on Elm Street?" 

A voice crackled back through the speaker. "Just another domestic disturbance, Grant. Woman screaming, husband... well, let's just say things are getting messy." 

Eli sighed.  There was a reason he avoided the night shift - it always seemed to churn out a symphony of chaos. But tonight felt different, heavier somehow. A dark, unsettling feeling clung to the air, whispering tales of something more sinister brewing beneath the surface of this mundane domestic drama.  He knew what that feeling meant: someone had called in "trouble" and Eli was now stuck at the epicenter.
