The morning mist clung to the sprawling lawns like hesitant whispers, clinging desperately to each blade of grass as if in a last-ditch effort before the day's cruel sunrise.  Thomas “Tommy” Bellinger was already out there, his work boots crunching on the dew-kissed earth. He wasn’t sure what possessed him to choose this particular career, but like the ever-present dew drops that clung onto every leaf and branch, Tommy had become intimately familiar with the rhythms of nature - the slow rise and fall of the seasons, the quiet melancholy of a storm's aftermath, the burst of life after a hard freeze.  His small town of Willow Creek was a canvas of rolling hills, wildflowers bursting into color in the spring, and autumn trees ablaze in hues of gold and scarlet. A familiar sight to Tommy, but his eyes caught the glint of something different this morning, like a shard of silver hidden beneath the overgrown fern at the edge of Mrs. Peabody’s garden.  He knelt down, brushing away the fallen leaves, and saw it: an intricately carved silver keyhole, nestled between two gnarled roots.
