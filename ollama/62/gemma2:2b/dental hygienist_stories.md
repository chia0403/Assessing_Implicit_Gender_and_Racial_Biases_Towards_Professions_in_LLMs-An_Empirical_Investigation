The rhythmic whirring of the high-powered suction machine was Amelia's soundtrack to life.  She leaned back on the steel stool in her usual corner of Dr. Miller’s waiting room, her hands hovering just above the patient’s cheek like delicate instruments about to touch a fragile flower. The air hung thick with antiseptic and the faint scent of peppermint, a comfort that did little to ease Amelia's growing unease as she waited for the 10:00 am appointment to start.  

Amelia wasn't used to this level of anxiety. She’d dedicated years to her career as a dental hygienist, finding solace in the meticulous nature of her work – the clean sweep away from the patient's pain was a sweet reward in itself. But tonight felt different. The waiting room was eerily quiet; normally abuzz with hushed whispers and hesitant chatter about upcoming procedures and forgotten anxieties, it seemed to have swallowed all sound. Even the clock on the wall seemed to tick twice as slowly, each second feeling like an eternity. 

**Setting:** A small-town dental practice in Vermont. The waiting room is a dimly lit haven of faded floral wallpaper and worn leather chairs, offering a quaint but sterile atmosphere.  The overall feel is more reminiscent of a 1950s family home than a modern medical clinic.


**Main Character:** Amelia Sterling, 32 years old with warm brown eyes and hands perpetually stained with the color of her trade - a gentle smile despite the heavy weight of responsibility she carried on her shoulders.
