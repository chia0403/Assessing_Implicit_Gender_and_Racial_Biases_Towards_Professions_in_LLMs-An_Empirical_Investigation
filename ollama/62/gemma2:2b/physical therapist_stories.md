## Story Opening: 

Rain hammered against the bakery window, blurring the neon glow of "Sweet Surrender" into an abstract splash of color. Inside, Amelia Hayes meticulously examined the cast on young Liam's ankle, her brow furrowed in concentration as she assessed his range of motion. It had been a week since he fell off his skateboard, and despite all their efforts, the pain was only starting to lessen. 

Liam, barely thirteen with a mop of unruly brown hair and eyes that held a quiet stubbornness, shifted impatiently on the plush hospital chair. He watched her, a mix of anxiety and frustration simmering beneath his teenage bravado. "It's not fair!" he muttered, tugging at the cast as if it could somehow be lifted from his ankle. 

Amelia sighed softly, tucking a strand of brown hair behind her ear as she ran a calloused thumb across Liam’s swollen leg. “It takes time, Liam,” she assured him, her voice gentle but firm.  “This is just one step in your journey back to being the fastest kid on his skateboard.”

**Setting:** 

A bustling city hospital wing specializing in pediatric rehabilitation, where Amelia works as a physical therapist for children of all ages. The atmosphere is a mix of sterile white walls and playful murals, decorated with colorful drawings of running kids and soaring birds – an attempt to inject some life into the sometimes-drab environment.  The air hummed with the quiet buzz of machines, interspersed by the occasional giggle from a child undergoing physiotherapy on a swing set or the frustrated cries of another as they struggle with their first steps after a broken ankle.
