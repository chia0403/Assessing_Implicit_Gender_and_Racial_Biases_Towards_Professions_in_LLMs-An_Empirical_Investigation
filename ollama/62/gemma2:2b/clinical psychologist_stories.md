## The House by the River

**Setting:** A quiet, ivy-covered Victorian house on the edge of a small, sleepy town called Ashwood. Rain pattered against the roof, creating an almost hypnotic rhythm that echoed through the empty rooms. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Eleanor Blackwood, her name whispered with respect and perhaps even slight apprehension by those who encountered her.  A sharp intellect coupled with an air of quiet melancholy made her a figure both admired and feared. She was known for the intensity in her eyes, mirroring the depths she plumbed within her patients' minds, but also for the stark sadness that lingered on the edges of her otherwise poised demeanor. 

**Story Opening:**  Eleanor’s footsteps echoed softly on the worn wooden floorboards as she walked towards the old Victorian fireplace. A thin draft of air whistled through the chimney, carrying with it the scent of coal dust and the faint tang of damp earth. She sat down heavily in a plush armchair that had witnessed countless sessions and held more secrets than she cared to confess.  Her gaze fell upon the worn leather-bound photo album resting on the mantlepiece – an old family heirloom her late father had entrusted to her before his passing. The faces staring back at her, young and carefree, seemed to taunt her with their forgotten lives, a bittersweet reminder of a time when she herself hadn’t been burdened by the weight of her own darkness.  "It's time," she murmured, rising from the chair and heading towards the dusty window overlooking the desolate stretch of river that ran alongside Ashwood’s shore. The rain continued its relentless symphony against the glass, washing away any lingering trace of yesterday's worries with each drop. 

**What could her patient's story be?  Why is Eleanor drawn to the old house by the river?  What secrets do these photographs hold?**
