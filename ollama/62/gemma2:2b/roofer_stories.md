The late October wind whipped through the rafters of the old Victorian house, a symphony of shrieks and sighs that echoed across the desolate street. Rain hammered against Ethan Thorne's weathered skin as he stood on his rickety ladder, peering down at the chimney of the imposing structure. It was his tenth job this week in this forgotten corner of the city, but each one felt like another layer peeling back the mystery of these crumbling bones that had once housed laughter and joy. 

Ethan Thorne, nicknamed "Skinny" for his eternally skinny frame, was just a roofer trying to make ends meet.  His hands were calloused, his body strong, his mind a constant battleground between grief and grit. Tonight, he was fixing the leaky roof of Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood's house after her beloved son left her with a mountain of bills and an inheritance that wouldnâ€™t even scratch the surface of the debt. He knew it wasn't just about fixing a roof; it was about mending a shattered soul.  His wife had passed away in April, leaving him to care for their young daughter, Lily. Ethan had poured his grief into work, finding solace in the rhythm of the hammer and the steady clang of tools.
