The desert air clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin, even inside his worn leather jacket and the thick wool pants he favored for such dry climates. He glanced at the sun-bleached thermometer on his clipboard – 110 degrees, it read. The sign above the door of Dr. Jensen's clinic in Alkali Flats simply read "Medical." But the name did little to soothe Elias' nerves as he walked through the bustling doorway and into a world that seemed to exist just below the simmering surface of the endless heat. 

Elias was no stranger to hardship, having spent his life chasing the elusive promise of healing amidst the harshest corners of America. He wasn't sure if it was the sun-bleached bones of the old clinic or the worn floorboards that seemed to hum with a faint vibration, but the air here felt heavy, charged like an untamed storm. As he adjusted his stethoscope and surveyed the waiting room, he felt a familiar pang in his chest – a mix of apprehension and determination.
