The grand ballroom shimmered with an elegance that seemed to sigh with its own history.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight filtering through stained-glass windows onto the polished marble floor of the Grandmont Hotel's opulent foyer.  But for Amelia Thorne, it was a place of familiar yet ever-changing chaos. Tonight, however, the usual symphony of clinking silverware and excited chatter was muted by a tense quiet. She glanced at the clock above the grand staircase, its ornate face frozen on the hour. 8:00 PM sharp.

Amelia, the concierge of the Grandmont for fifteen years now, moved with practiced grace through the swirling sea of well-dressed guests, her eyes ever sharp.  Each guest was a puzzle, each one a potential threat to the delicate balance between discretion and privacy that Amelia's role demanded.  Tonight, however, she found herself staring at a man who looked out of place in this world of silk and diamonds. His face was shrouded by shadows as he leaned against the wall, his presence like a storm cloud on a bright summer day. 

His name, whispered with hushed reverence around the hotel's hallowed halls, was Dimitri Volkov, a known figure to Amelia from years past.  But tonight, he was no more than another face in the crowd, waiting for something only he knew.
