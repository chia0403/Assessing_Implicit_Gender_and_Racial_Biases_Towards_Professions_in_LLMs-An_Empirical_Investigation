The flickering lanterns cast long shadows across the obsidian stone walls of Citadel Spire. A bone-chilling wind howled down the narrow alley, whipping rain against the grime-coated windows. Inside, **Barnabus “Barney” Blackwood**, a seasoned guard with eyes as sharp as his wit and shoulders twice as heavy, stood at his post.  He'd seen more nights like this than he could count - a symphony of whispered secrets, hushed threats, and the ever-present hum of unease that clung to the Citadel like a second skin.

The air thrummed with the electric tension of approaching storms. Not the kind that brought buckets of rain and howling winds, but the kind that crackled with danger in the form of whispers, veiled words, and hidden agendas - all of which seemed to swirl around him, making it difficult to discern what was reality and what was just a figment of his overactive imagination.  Tonight felt different though. Tonight, the air itself seemed thick with unspoken anxieties, as if each guard's breath held secrets they dared not speak aloud. 

The Citadel had always been shrouded in secrecy, its inner workings guarded by an invisible veil that even the most seasoned veterans struggled to penetrate. Barney was a man of habit, yet tonight, he felt oddly unsettled, like something shifted in the shadows around him. His gaze drifted towards the entrance gate, where a shadowed figure stood motionless against the flickering light - a man whose eyes held an unsettling intensity, a predator lurking on the cusp of action.
