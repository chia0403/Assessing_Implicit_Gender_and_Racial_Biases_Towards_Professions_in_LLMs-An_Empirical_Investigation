## Opening

The clang of steel against steel was a familiar symphony in Thomas "Tommy" Thornton's ears. Sunlight filtered through the smoke-stained window of his shop, turning the polished floor into a mosaic of light and shadow. The air hung heavy with the scent of aging leather, dried herbs, and meat â€“ all things that promised both comfort and danger in equal measure. 

Tommy was old now, weathered as an oak but with eyes that still held the spark of youth. They twinkled at the sight of a perfect cut of beef, or the way his customers' jaws dropped upon seeing his prized selection of wild boar hams. For decades, he had carved meat, not just for sustenance, but for celebration, for mourning, and even for the occasional stolen moment of quiet joy. 

This day was no different.  As Tommy swung his cleaver, a rhythmic melody against wood and bone, the sounds of the morning market filled his world: the distant chatter, the hawking cries, the children's laughter. It was all a part of a life lived on the edge of chaos and order, a dance between the living and the dead, the clean and the raw. 


**Setting:**  A quaint, old-fashioned butcher shop in a bustling market town. The shop is dimly lit with oil lamps, the walls lined with shelves stocked with various cuts of meat and preserved food. Outside, sounds of the market unfold - the constant flow of people, the clattering wagons, and the vibrant cacophony of daily life. 


**Main Character:** Thomas "Tommy" Thornton.  He is a stoic but caring butcher who has seen a lifetime of joys and sorrows in his shop. He understands the weight of meat not just as nourishment, but as symbol.
