The amber glow from the setting sun painted long shadows across Engine 43's bay doors as Lieutenant Elias "Eli" Pierce hurried through them, his boots crunching on the worn concrete floor. The air was thick with the scent of diesel and burnt pine needles, a familiar cocktail that had clung to Eli since he first donned his helmet in his teenage years.  He wasn't just following orders; tonight, he could smell the desperation radiating off the charred wooden frame of a small cabin nestled deep within Redwood Canyon National Forest. It was a place where life was slow and quiet, a sanctuary for those seeking solace from the outside world - until it wasn't. 

Eli adjusted his jacket, its worn leather feeling reassuring against his skin. The past few weeks had been unusually grueling, the city fire calls relentless even in their quiet corner of California.  Tonight, though, a different kind of pressure was settling in his chest – not from the rising tension he usually felt during a call, but something deeper, more personal. A silent scream echoed through the night, fueled by the memories of his father's words – "It doesn't just burn down, Eli. It burns inside."  He had never quite understood then what his father meant, but tonight, it felt like his own life was on fire.
