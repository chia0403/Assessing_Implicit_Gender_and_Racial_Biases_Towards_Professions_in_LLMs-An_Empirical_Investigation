Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the city skyline into a watery canvas. Inside, EMT Ethan Reyes gripped the worn radio in his hand, its static crackle filling the silence as he waited for orders from dispatch. The city air was thick with humidity and the metallic scent of blood. It had been hours since the call came - multiple car accidents, each one more gruesome than the last. The only thing keeping Ethan grounded was the rhythmic beeping of a heart monitor; a patient's life hanging by a thread in his hands. 

Ethan Reyes was no stranger to chaos. His entire life had been dedicated to serving the sick and injured, but tonight the weight of this storm seemed to press down on him even harder than usual. He scanned the city map, his gaze lingering on the battered intersection where most of the accidents had occurred - a place choked with cars and obscured by a thick layer of rain. 

He wasn't afraid. Just...tired.
