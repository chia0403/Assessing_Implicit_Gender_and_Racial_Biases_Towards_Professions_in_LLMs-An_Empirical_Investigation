##  The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** The seaside town of Oakhaven nestled amongst rolling green hills and dotted with charming Victorian cottages. The salty air carries the scent of seaweed and the distant laughter of children playing on the pebbled beach. 

**Character:** Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont, a young but seasoned counseling psychologist who has just moved to Oakhaven to escape the concrete jungle of New York City. She'd always felt out of place in the bustling city, yearning for something quieter and more authentic. Now, surrounded by the calming rhythm of the waves and the whispers of wind through the ancient oak trees, Ellie finds a quiet solace she hadn't anticipated. 

**Opening:** 

"The sea has a way of making you feel insignificant," Ellie muttered to herself as she walked along the shore. She had taken a deep breath of fresh air, letting the scent of salt and seaweed fill her lungs, a stark contrast to the exhaust fumes that had been her constant companion in New York. The setting sun cast long, dancing shadows on the sand and the crashing waves seemed to whisper secrets Ellie wasn't quite ready to unravel. 

It was here, at the edge of the world where the sea met the sky, that she'd set up her practice - "The Lighthouse Within." Her own little haven in a community overflowing with life and stories. But today, as Ellie gazed out at the endless horizon, she felt an unease stirring within. A sense of being pulled towards something she couldn't quite understand.  A call to answer, perhaps. Or just a reminder that the human spirit, like the ocean, has its own depths yet to be explored.
