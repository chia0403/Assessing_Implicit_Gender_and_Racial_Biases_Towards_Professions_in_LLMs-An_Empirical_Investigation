Rain lashed against the bakery windows, blurring the already gray cityscape outside.  **Amelia "Amy" Thorne**, her chestnut-brown hair tucked under a woolen hat pulled low over her forehead, sighed as she watched the downpour from the warmth of the cozy cafe inside. A steaming latte in hand, she was used to this rhythm – a quiet morning walk, a caffeine fix at a local haunt, and then hitting the streets with a stack of pre-sale brochures under her arm.

Amy knew this place held potential, but she also knew it was a battle against time – a constant tug-of-war between the city's relentless pace and the quiet charm of the building itself. The rain continued its rhythmic tapdance against the glass, a symphony for Amy’s thoughts as she prepared for her first showing that morning.
