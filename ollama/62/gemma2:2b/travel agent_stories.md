The humid air hung heavy in the air conditioning of Amelia Thistlewick's office, thick enough to choke on. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, making kaleidoscopic patterns on the worn maps spread across her desk.  Outside, Palm Springs shimmered under a merciless sun;  a landscape of palm trees and mirrored pools that seemed oblivious to the mounting chaos within Amelia's own mind. 

Amelia, a woman built like a ship’s mast with knees perpetually dusted with the faint scent of lavender from her perfume collection, ran one hand through her tangle of ginger hair. "I can't believe I haven't done anything about this yet," she muttered to herself, tapping impatiently at a stack of itineraries that looked more like hieroglyphics than travel plans.  

Her phone vibrated with a message – a frantic plea from Ms. Eleanor Thorne, an elderly widow whose penchant for exotic locales was only eclipsed by her stubborn insistence on a single-room hotel in Marrakech. The problem? Amelia had already committed to a family vacation to the Amazon rainforest. 


**Setting:** A small, sun-drenched office in Palm Springs, California. It is filled with maps and travel brochures, but an air of tension hangs thick in the room as Amelia contemplates the chaos ahead.  

**Character:** Amelia Thistlewick, a seasoned travel agent whose life has become entangled in a web of demanding clients and ever-increasing deadlines.
