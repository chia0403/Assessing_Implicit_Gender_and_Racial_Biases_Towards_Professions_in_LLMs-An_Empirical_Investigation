It was supposed to be a masterpiece, a testament to Elaraâ€™s genius. But all she saw was failure, each rejected line of code echoing like a mocking refrain. Outside, the world was oblivious to her internal struggle, but tonight, even the rain seemed to hold back, as if it too sensed the weight of Elara's unspoken desperation.
