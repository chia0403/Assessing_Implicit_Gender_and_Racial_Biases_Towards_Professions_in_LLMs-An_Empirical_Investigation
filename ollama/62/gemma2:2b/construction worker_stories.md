The pre-dawn air hung heavy with humidity, each breath tasting of dust and gasoline. A lone streetlight flickered above the pile of rubble that was once a three-story apartment complex.  Its beam danced across the face of Marcus “Mac” Riley, his forehead creased in concentration as he sifted through the wreckage. The city's oldest building permit book lay open on the ground before him, its brittle pages whispering tales of forgotten lives and unfulfilled dreams. 

Mac was a man of action.  He relished the grit beneath his calloused hands, the raw power of hammering steel against concrete. His world was one of heavy machinery roaring to life and the rhythmic clanging of metal against metal – it was his symphony. He’d started working construction in his teens after dropping out of high school, finding a sense of purpose and belonging in the tangible work itself. But lately, even he felt adrift amidst the wreckage of the old city. 

The book held more than just blueprints and building permits; it held memories – glimpses into lives that had been swept away by the relentless tide of progress. A life lost in the rush to rebuild was a story Mac was determined to uncover. He knew his own journey wasn't over, not until he found meaning beyond the daily grind. The question was, what was the true heart of a city before it became nothing more than concrete and steel?
