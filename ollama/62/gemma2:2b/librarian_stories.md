Rain lashed against the library windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor Sterling's soul. The aroma of aged paper and leather usually soothed her frayed nerves, but today it felt like bile rising in her throat.  Eleanor, with a heart heavy as a lead tome and a gaze that could pierce a decade-old dust cover, stood before the towering shelves of the West End Library. 

She ran a trembling hand over the worn spines of the first editions, each one whispering forgotten stories under the flickering gaslight. The library, her haven for generations, was also her prison.  Its hushed sanctuary had become a cage where she was trapped, forced to guard secrets that were eating away at her sanity. 

The clock on the antique mantelpiece ticked with a relentless rhythm, echoing the panic gnawing at Eleanor's insides. She felt like she was in the middle of one of Edgar Allan Poe's macabre tales - lost in the labyrinthine halls, surrounded by dusty whispers and looming shadows. And then, there it was â€“ a single red feather lying on the floor beneath a forgotten shelf. A crimson drop from another world, another story waiting to be told...
