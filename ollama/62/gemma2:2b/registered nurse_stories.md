## Opening:

The humid air clung to Elara Thorne like a second skin as she surveyed the chaos that was St. Jude's Emergency Room. Her white coat felt clammy against her chest as the steady stream of ambulances and frantic parents rushed through the doors. It was 3 am, after all, the hour when life expectancy became a gamble in the blink of an eye. 

Elara ran a weary hand down the side of her stethoscope, its smooth leather almost worn through from years of use.  She’d been here since before dawn, tending to wounds and mending broken souls – literally and figuratively – in the heart-stopping drama of life and death's final act.  As she navigated through the sterile corridors, the faint scent of disinfectant mingled with fear, hope, and a desperate longing for normalcy. 

She could almost picture her own mother's anxious face as she had faced down countless crises throughout her career, each one leaving an indelible mark on Elara's soul.  Her mom’s calm eyes would always hold the promise of strength, even in the darkest hours.


## Setting: 

St. Jude's Emergency Room, a sprawling urban hospital located in Chicago's bustling downtown. It was known for its round-the-clock emergency service, housing an assortment of patients and medical professionals from different backgrounds. Elara found herself surrounded by a cacophony of beeping monitors, urgent cries, and the sterile rhythm of life support systems.  The room’s atmosphere was one of both quiet desperation and unwavering urgency, where every heartbeat echoed the weight of human vulnerability in its raw form.
