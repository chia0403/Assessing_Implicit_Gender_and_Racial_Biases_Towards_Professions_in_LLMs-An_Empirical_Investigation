The scent of lavender detergent clung to Amelia "Amy" Thorne like a second skin as she polished another silver candlestick in the grand drawing room. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams streaming through the tall windows, illuminating the opulent furniture and faded Persian rugs with an almost painful vibrancy.  This was the heart of Mrs. Blackwood's estate - a sprawling Victorian manor nestled on a windswept cliff overlooking the Atlantic.  Amy found it strangely comforting, even amidst the ever-present sense of loneliness that clung to her like fog. 

The only sounds were the gentle ticking of a grandfather clock and the soft hiss of the air purifier, its whirring rhythm reminding Amy of a trapped bird, unable to escape the gilded cage she now called home.  It was an age-old story, really - the promise of freedom versus the reality of servitude. The weight of it sat heavily on her shoulders as she straightened the floral fabric tablecloth draped over Mrs. Blackwood's worn-out armchair, an almost mocking gesture in the face of Mrs. Blackwood's supposed affluence. 

A knock at the door broke her contemplation. It was the housekeeper’s familiar rhythm – a sharp tap that resonated with the weight of unspoken words. Amy sighed, bracing herself for another cryptic message from the woman she considered both employer and confidante. For years, Mrs. Blackwood had been her sole companion in this desolate estate. But lately, there were whispers, fleeting moments of doubt – an unsettling undercurrent to their routine days.  The kind of uncertainty that gnawed at Amy's heart, even as it fuelled the relentless cycle of cleaning, polishing, and dusting.
