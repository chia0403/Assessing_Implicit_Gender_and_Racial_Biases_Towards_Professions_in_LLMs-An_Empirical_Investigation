Rain lashed against the ornate glass doors of The Grand Astoria Hotel, blurring the city's dazzling lights into a kaleidoscope of color. Inside, Bartholomew "Bart" Hawthorne, all lean muscles and worn-leather shoes, wiped his forehead with a checkered handkerchief.  He stood in the hotel's grand lobby, a symphony of polished wood, ornate chandeliers, and cascading silk curtains that draped like phantom wings over velvet chairs. A damp chill clung to the air, mingling with the scent of freshly cut roses and expensive cologne.  Bart sighed, tucking a stray lock of red hair behind his ear. This was The Grand Astoria – a monument to opulence and an ironic echo of Bart's own modest life. He’d been assigned room 307, a tiny corner of a luxurious world that felt worlds away from the bustling alleyways and grimy streets he called home.

But tonight, under the flickering gaslight, a different kind of hum was in the air:  a hushed, conspiratorial buzz that promised secrets whispered through shadowed hallways and forgotten rooms. Bart's eyes followed the fleeting movement of a figure in the corner. A woman shrouded in a long, black coat, her features concealed by a wide-brimmed hat. She slipped into a small side door, almost unnoticed amidst the sea of hurried faces and hushed conversations.  Something about her aura – a sense of quiet power and a hidden flicker of defiance – caught Bart's attention.
