## The Taxman Cometh: A Story Opening

The air in the cramped office smelled vaguely of stale coffee and old paper.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes outside, blurring the urban landscape into a watery smear. **Agnes "Aggie" Carmichael**, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a messy bun and eyes perpetually glued to the screen showing lines of income tax forms, sighed deeply. This was it: Tax season 2023 had officially started, and it felt heavier than usual. The weight of expectation pressed down on her as she stared at another pile of receipts and W-2s, each one a reminder of the daunting financial landscape facing countless Americans.

It wasn't just the paperwork that weighed heavy; Aggie knew this year was different. There were whispers in the neighborhood, murmurs about rising costs, shrinking savings, and an increasingly uncertain future for many families she helped navigate through their tax returns.  She felt a knot of apprehension tighten in her chest as she thought of the families who'd rely on her expertise to make sense of the labyrinthine world of income taxes and deductions. 

As she clicked "Start" on a fresh new form, the rhythmic tapping of keys filled the quiet office, but it did little to calm the storm brewing inside. The tax season was upon them, and Aggie had a feeling this year would be the hardest yet.  


**Setting:** A modest, dimly lit office above a small bakery in a working-class neighborhood of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
