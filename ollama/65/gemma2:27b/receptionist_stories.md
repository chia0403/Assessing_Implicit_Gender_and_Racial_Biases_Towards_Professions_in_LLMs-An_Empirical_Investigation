The insistent chirping of the antique phone on her desk pierced through Amelia Thistlewick's daydream of sun-drenched beaches and turquoise waters. She jolted upright in her chair, the plush velvet cushioning sighing beneath her. The opulent lobby of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, with its vaulted ceilings adorned with twinkling crystal chandeliers and marble floors polished to a mirror shine, seemed to mock her momentary escape.

Amelia straightened her crisp lavender blouse, smoothed down the skirt of her navy pencil dress, and reached for the phone.  "Grand Blackwood Hotel, Amelia Thistlewick speaking," she intoned, her voice carefully neutral despite the sigh that escaped her lips. She longed for something more than answering calls and redirecting guests in this gilded cage.

A gruff voice on the other end demanded a room with a view, "And make it quick, woman. I haven't got all day." Amelia stifled a groan. This was just another Tuesday at the Grand Blackwood.
