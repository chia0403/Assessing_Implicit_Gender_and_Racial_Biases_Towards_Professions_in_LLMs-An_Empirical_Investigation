The air in Myrtle Creek hung thick and heavy with humidity, even at this ungodly hour before sunrise. Sweat beaded on Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' forehead as he wrestled with the rusted pipes beneath Mrs. Henderson's sink. 

Bart wasn't one for early mornings, but a burst pipe rarely waited for convenience. His trusty headlamp illuminated the cramped space beneath the sink, revealing a labyrinth of corroded copper and leaky joints. The rhythmic drip, drip, drip of escaping water was driving him mad, each drop echoing the relentless ticking of his internal clock. He needed to fix this before Mrs. Henderson's prized orchids drowned in a deluge of her own making.

Myrtle Creek, nestled in the heart of Oregon's Willamette Valley, was a town steeped in history and secrets. The smell of pine needles and damp earth mingled with the sweet scent of honeysuckle, creating an intoxicating aroma that was both calming and unnerving. Bart knew every cobbled street and hidden alleyway like the back of his calloused hand. He'd been born and raised here, and despite his dreams of leaving for something bigger, he always seemed to find himself drawn back to the familiar comfort of this small town.
