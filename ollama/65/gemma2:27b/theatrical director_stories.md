The air backstage at the Grand Rialto Theatre hummed with nervous energy.  A tangle of cables snaked across the dusty floorboards, casting long shadows in the flickering gaslight. Rosalind "Roz" Beaumont, her brow furrowed with concentration, paced back and forth, adjusting the velvet curtain with a practiced hand. Tonight was opening night for "The Tempest," Roz's most ambitious production yet.

The Grand Rialto, a venerable dame of a theatre dating back to the 1890s, had seen its share of triumphs and tragedies. Its ornate balcony overlooking the cavernous auditorium was rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a former actress, her ethereal whispers still echoing through the rafters. Roz, however, paid no mind to such tales. She was consumed with the task at hand â€“ transforming Shakespeare's timeless tale into a spectacle that would captivate and enthrall her audience.
