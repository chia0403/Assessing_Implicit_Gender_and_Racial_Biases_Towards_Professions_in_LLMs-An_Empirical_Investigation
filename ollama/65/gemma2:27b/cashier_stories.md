The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the overflowing shopping baskets piled precariously on the conveyor belt.  Eleanor Price, her nametag slightly askew, sighed as she scanned another jumbo pack of toilet paper, her smile strained and practiced. The air hung thick with the scent of bleach and overripe bananas, a symphony of smells unique to the Discount Emporium. It was Tuesday afternoon, the usual lull before the after-work rush, but Eleanor's mind was already elsewhere. She pictured herself on a windswept beach, salt spray stinging her face as she learned to surf, far from the monotonous beeps and the endless parade of canned goods and frozen dinners.  Today, however, the sea remained a distant dream, replaced by the insistent drone of a customer impatiently tapping his foot behind her.
