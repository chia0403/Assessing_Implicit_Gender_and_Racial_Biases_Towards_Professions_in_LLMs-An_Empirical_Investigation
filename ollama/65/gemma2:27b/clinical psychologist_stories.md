Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already dim cityscape beyond. The rhythmic drumming amplified the silence within the room, broken only by the occasional tick of the antique grandfather clock in the corner. Eleanor sat hunched over her desk, a half-empty mug of lukewarm tea steaming beside her, its aroma doing little to soothe the unease gnawing at her gut.

She was waiting for a patient, one she'd been anticipating with a mixture of professional curiosity and personal trepidation. His name was Elias Thorne, and his file contained details that were both intriguing and disturbing: a renowned physicist suffering from debilitating insomnia, plagued by recurring visions he insisted were not dreams but glimpses into alternate realities. 

Eleanor adjusted the lamp on her desk, casting a warm glow across the worn leather armchair opposite her, where Elias would soon be sitting. The room felt heavy with unspoken questions, the weight of the unknown pressing down on her.  This case was unlike any she'd encountered before, and Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that it was about to unravel something far bigger than herself.
