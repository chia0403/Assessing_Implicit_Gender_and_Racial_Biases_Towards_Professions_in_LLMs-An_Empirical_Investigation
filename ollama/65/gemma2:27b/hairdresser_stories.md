The aroma of jasmine and lavender hung thick in the air, battling with the sharper scent of peroxide.  It was Wednesday morning, just past 9:00 am, and Eloise Marie Devereaux's salon, "Shear Serenity," buzzed with its usual controlled chaos. Two stylists, Maya and Carlos, were juggling blow dryers and colour brushes, while Eloise herself stood meticulously sectioning a client's auburn hair for highlights. Outside the large picture window, the vibrant tapestry of New Orleans' French Quarter unfolded: wrought iron balconies draped in bougainvillea, tourists weaving through cobblestone streets, and the rhythmic thrum of jazz drifting from a nearby bar. But Eloise wasn't focused on the cityscape. Her mind was occupied with the intricate dance of strands she held between her fingers, transforming a head of hair into a work of art.

Today felt different though. A tremor of unease ran through her, a premonition as subtle as the shimmer of gold dust in the salon's mirror. Something was about to shift, Eloise knew it deep in her bones. The question wasn't if, but when.
