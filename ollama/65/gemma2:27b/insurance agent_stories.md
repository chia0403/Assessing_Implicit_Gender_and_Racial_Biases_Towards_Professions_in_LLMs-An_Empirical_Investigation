Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Archibald "Archie" Finch's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing the dull thud in his chest. The flickering neon sign outside - "Finch & Sons Insurance: Protecting What Matters Most" - seemed to mock him. He stared at the stack of rejection letters on his desk, each one another nail hammered into the coffin of his family business. 

His grandfather, a stern but kind man, had started Finch & Sons in the sleepy town of Oakhaven back in 1947. Back then, everyone knew Archie's grandpappy, trusted him with their homes and lives. But times had changed. Now, Oakhaven was shrinking, swallowed by the sprawling city encroaching from the south.  Big insurance corporations with glossy brochures and online platforms were driving out the little guys like Archie.

He sighed, pushing back a strand of greasy brown hair that perpetually fell over his forehead. He needed a win, something, anything to prove Finch & Sons still mattered. As if summoned by his desperation, the phone on his desk rang, shattering the silence. Archie snatched it up, praying for a miracle.
