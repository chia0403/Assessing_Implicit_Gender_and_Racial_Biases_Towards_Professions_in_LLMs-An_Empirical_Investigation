The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Finch, her brow furrowed beneath wisps of auburn hair escaping their braid, stared down at the emaciated figure on the cot. The flickering gaslight cast long, grotesque shadows across the man's skeletal face, highlighting the feverish sheen on his skin. His chest rose and fell in shallow, ragged gasps, a testament to the relentless grip of the plague that had descended upon London like a shroud.

Evelyn's clinic, nestled amongst the cobblestone alleyways of Whitechapel, was overflowing with the sick and dying. The constant clatter of coughers, the moans of the afflicted, and the incessant ringing of the bell above her door had become a chilling symphony of despair.  She longed for the quiet solitude of her laboratory, for the comfort of her microscope and beakers, where she could lose herself in the intricate world of cells and bacteria. But duty called, demanding that she face the horrors unfolding before her with unwavering resolve.

Tonight, however, was different. The man on the cot wasn't just another victim. He was Elias Thorne, a renowned scholar, and Evelyn's childhood friend.  His once-piercing blue eyes were now clouded with delirium, a haunting reminder of the devastating power of this invisible enemy.
