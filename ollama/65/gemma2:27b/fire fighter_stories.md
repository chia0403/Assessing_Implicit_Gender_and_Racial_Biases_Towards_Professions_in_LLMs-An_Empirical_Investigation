The acrid smell of smoke stung Amelia "Amy" Callahan's nostrils even before she yanked open the firehouse door.  It was 3:17 am, the unholy hour when dreams were sweetest and sleep most stubborn. But not for Amy. Not anymore.

She lived for this moment – the deafening wail of the siren ripping through the night stillness, the adrenaline surge as she sprinted towards the gleaming red engine, the camaraderie of her fellow firefighters already suited up and ready to go. Tonight's call came from the old bakery on Elm Street, a two-story brick building with its windows glowing an ominous orange. Amy could already picture the flames licking at the doughy insides, threatening to consume everything in their path.

Tonight wasn’t just another fire. It was personal. This bakery had been her childhood haunt, where she'd devoured sugary croissants and dreamt of one day becoming a hero like those brave firefighters who rushed into burning buildings. Little Amy never knew that someday she'd be one of them, battling the very flames that threatened to erase her memories.
