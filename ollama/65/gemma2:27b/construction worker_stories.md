The relentless sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" O'Malley's neck as he wrestled with a stubborn length of rebar. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy cityscape stretching out beyond the skeletal frame of the high-rise he was helping erect. The air hummed with the insistent whine of power tools and the rhythmic clang of hammers striking steel, a symphony of construction that Bart had come to find both comforting and infuriating in equal measure. 

Today, though, the usual cacophony felt different. A prickling unease crawled up his spine, like an unseen spider weaving its web on the back of his neck. He glanced around at his fellow workers – burly men with faces etched by years of sun and toil – but none seemed to share his disquiet. Perhaps it was just the heat playing tricks on him. Bart forced himself to focus on the task at hand, twisting the rebar into submission with a grunt of exertion.

But as he straightened up, wiping his brow with a grease-stained sleeve, a glint of something unusual caught his eye. It was nestled amongst the tangle of scaffolding and girders, reflecting the sunlight with an unnatural brilliance: a small, intricately carved box, its surface adorned with symbols he'd never seen before.  Bart felt an undeniable pull towards it, a curiosity so strong that he abandoned his rebar and cautiously made his way towards the mysterious object.
