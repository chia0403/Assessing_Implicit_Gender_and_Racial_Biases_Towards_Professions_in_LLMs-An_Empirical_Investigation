Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of The Chronicle's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor "Ellie" Davies.  The stale scent of cigarette smoke and yesterday's coffee hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the insistent clattering of a vintage typewriter from the corner cubicle. Ellie chewed on the end of her pen, frustration twisting her gut. Three days she'd been chasing this lead - whispers of a conspiracy swirling around the recent closure of the city's beloved textile mill, The Weaver's Pride.  The official line was "economic downturn," but something about it smelled rotten, like old wool left too long in the damp.

Outside, the neon glow of the diner across the street flickered through the downpour, a lone beacon against the oppressive grey sky. Ellie glanced at the clock â€“ 10:47 pm. Time for another desperate call to her source, "Old Man" Higgins, a former mill worker rumored to know more than he let on.  She just hoped he wouldn't hang up on her again.
