Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Detective Elias "Eli" Vance's office, blurring the neon cityscape outside into an impressionistic smear of red and blue. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and despair - a potent aroma Eli had come to associate with his job in the Grimhaven precinct. 

A stack of cold case files teetered precariously on his desk, each one representing another unsolved mystery, another grieving family left yearning for answers. Eli ran a weary hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, the lines etched around his eyes deepening with every unanswered question. Tonight, however, promised something different. A new lead in the case of The Orchid Killer, a serial murderer who had terrorized Grimhaven five years ago, leaving behind a trail of victims adorned with exotic orchids. Eli's gut told him this was it - the break they'd been waiting for.
