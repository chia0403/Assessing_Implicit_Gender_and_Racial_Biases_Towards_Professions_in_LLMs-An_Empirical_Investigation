The incessant drip from the leaky faucet in Alistair Finch's office was like a metronome marking out his mounting anxiety. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane overlooking the dingy alleyway, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. 

Alistair wasn't known for his nerves. In fact, he thrived on courtroom drama, relished the clash of wills and the razor-sharp edge of legal debate. But this case was different. This time, the stakes weren't just a win or a loss; they were life and death. 


His client, a young woman named Elara Vance, sat across from him, her face pale and drawn. She clutched a faded photograph â€“ a picture of herself as a carefree child, laughing with a man Alistair recognized from the file: Marcus Vance, her father, accused of embezzling millions from his own company. 

The evidence was damning. But Elara swore her father was innocent, that he'd been framed. Her desperation, her unwavering faith in her father, gnawed at Alistair's resolve. He knew he couldn't let her down. Not this time.
