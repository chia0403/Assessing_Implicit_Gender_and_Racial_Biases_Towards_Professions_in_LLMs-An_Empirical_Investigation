The biting wind whipped across Alaric Blackwood’s face, carrying with it the scent of brine and something else, something acrid and unfamiliar. He pulled his threadbare cloak tighter around him, cursing the shoddy repairs he'd made last week. The seams were already starting to give way. A shiver ran down his spine, but it wasn't just from the cold. 

Alaric stood perched on the crumbling parapet of Stormhaven Citadel, the highest point in the city overlooking the churning grey expanse of the Azure Sea. Below him, cobbled streets snaked through a labyrinth of ancient stone buildings, their rooftops dusted with snow. The once vibrant port city now wore a cloak of melancholy, its bustling markets replaced by deserted squares and boarded-up shops. Fear clung to Stormhaven like sea fog.

For weeks, whispers had spread about strange ships appearing on the horizon, their sails black as night, bearing symbols Alaric couldn't decipher. Rumours abounded of monstrous creatures emerging from the depths, preying on fishing vessels. The Council dismissed them as fisherman's tales, but Alaric, a seasoned guard who’d seen his fair share of horrors during the Goblin Wars, knew better. Something was wrong, terribly wrong.

He gripped the hilt of his rusty sword, its familiar weight offering a sliver of comfort.  Today, he had a feeling his vigilance would be tested.
