Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Evelyn "Eve" Sinclair's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. The flickering fluorescent light cast harsh shadows across the cluttered desk piled high with case files, each one a testament to lives teetering on the edge. Tonight, it was Daniel Ramirez's file that held her attention captive. His parole hearing was tomorrow, and she wasn't sure if he deserved another chance. 

Eve's office was tucked away in a forgotten corner of the crumbling courthouse, its beige walls stained with years of neglect. A single wilted ficus tree stood sentinel in the corner, its leaves drooping like Eveâ€™s spirits. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and despair, a constant reminder of the weight she carried on her shoulders. Outside, the city of New Haven throbbed with an indifferent pulse, oblivious to the battles fought and lost within these walls.
