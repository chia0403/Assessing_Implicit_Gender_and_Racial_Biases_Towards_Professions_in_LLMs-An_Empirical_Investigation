Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane of "Griffin's Remedies," blurring the neon sign that flickered intermittently. Inside, Eleanor Griffin adjusted her spectacles and sighed, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear. The bell above the door chimed mournfully as another customer stumbled in, shaking rain from their coat like a drowned dog. This was Willow Creek, after all â€“ a town where the weather mirrored the mood. 

Eleanor surveyed the newcomer. A young man, barely out of his teens, with worried eyes and a tremor in his hand. He clutched a crumpled prescription slip like it held the key to salvation. Eleanor knew that look. It was the same one she saw reflected in her own mirror every morning. The weight of expectations, the burden of healing, the constant fear of making a mistake. 

Tonight, the pharmacy felt colder than usual.  Eleanor straightened her posture, plastered on her best reassuring smile, and approached the counter. "Welcome to Griffin's Remedies," she said, her voice warm despite the chill in the air. "What can I do for you?"
