The Grand Blackwood Hotel shimmered under the oppressive July sun, its white facade reflecting heat like a furnace. Inside, it was no cooler. A stifling humidity hung in the air, thick with the scent of lilies from the lobby's enormous vase and something faintly metallic, perhaps the lingering ghost of yesterday's thunderstorm.

Bartholomew "Bart" Quinton adjusted his faded blue uniform, tugging at the stiff collar. Sweat prickled under his arms despite the thin cotton undershirt. He hefted a battered suitcase onto the brass luggage trolley, its rusty wheels protesting with a shriek. Another day, another parade of demanding guests and overstuffed bags. Bart sighed, longing for the cool breeze of the Atlantic Ocean he'd left behind in Maine.

He wheeled the trolley towards the imposing mahogany door marked "Suite 502", where a haughty woman in a crimson dress stood impatiently tapping her foot. A diamond necklace glittered at her throat, catching the light like trapped fireflies. Bart knew better than to meet her eyes directly; his gaze remained respectfully averted as he offered a practiced smile.

"Good afternoon, ma'am. Bartholomew Quinton, at your service."
