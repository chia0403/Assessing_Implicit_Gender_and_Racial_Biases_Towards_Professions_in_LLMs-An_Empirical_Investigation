The air in "Nails by Noelle" hummed with the scent of acetone and lavender. Outside, the late summer sun beat down on Harmony Creek's sleepy Main Street, baking the sidewalk to a shimmering haze. But inside, Amelia Noelle Carmichael reigned supreme, her domain a haven of twinkling fairy lights, plush velvet chairs, and the soft murmur of jazz. 

Noelle, with her fiery red curls piled atop her head in a messy bun, was meticulously shaping Mrs. Henderson's nails into perfect almond ovals.  Her nimble fingers danced across the delicate skin, each movement precise and purposeful. As she worked, her mind raced, not dwelling on the intricate floral design Mrs. Henderson had requested, but on the cryptic message scrawled on a crumpled napkin left on her doorstep that morning: "Midnight. Willow Creek Bridge."
