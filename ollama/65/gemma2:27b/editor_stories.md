Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Amelia Blackwood's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously on every surface – a testament to the relentless torrent of submissions she received daily as Senior Editor at Quill & Ink Publishing House. Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples. The deadline for the annual "Voices of Tomorrow" anthology loomed, and none of the entries sparked even a flicker of excitement.

She was renowned for her sharp eye and ruthless honesty, able to dissect a manuscript with surgical precision. Yet, this year, every story felt flat, predictable, lacking that spark of originality she craved. Amelia pushed away a particularly convoluted fantasy epic, its pages stained with coffee rings – a grim reflection of her own exhaustion.

Just as she was about to succumb to despair, a battered manila envelope landed on her desk with an unceremonious thud. The return address simply read "Anonymous," handwritten in shaky script. Curiosity piqued, Amelia carefully slit open the envelope, her fingers brushing against the rough texture of the paper inside.  A single sheet lay within, bearing just one line: 

"The world forgets what it cannot see." 


And beneath it, a title: "The Echoing Silence."
