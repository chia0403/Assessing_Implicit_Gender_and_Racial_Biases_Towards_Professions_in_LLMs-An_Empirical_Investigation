Each drop felt like a tiny hammer blow against her composure, mirroring the storm raging inside her. The sleek mahogany desk, usually a stage for her strategic brilliance, was littered with reports, each one a grim testament to the plummeting stock prices and dwindling investor confidence.

The company she'd poured her heart and soul into was on the brink of collapse.
