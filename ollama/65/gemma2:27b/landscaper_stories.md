The August sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn rose bush. Thorns snagged at his worn denim shirt, drawing beads of sweat that stung his eyes. His usual haven – Mrs. Hathaway's sprawling Victorian garden – felt like a furnace today. The air hung heavy with the perfume of roses and lavender, but even those sweet scents couldn't mask the oppressive heat.

Silas grimaced, wiping his brow with the back of his hand. He loved transforming neglected spaces into vibrant oases, but even he had his limits. Today, the only oasis he craved was a shady spot under the ancient oak tree at the edge of the property, preferably accompanied by a tall glass of iced tea.

He glanced at the sprawling lawn beyond the rose garden, its emerald blades shimmering in the sunlight. The Hathaways' annual summer soirée was just two weeks away, and Silas had promised himself he'd have the entire grounds looking pristine for the occasion.
