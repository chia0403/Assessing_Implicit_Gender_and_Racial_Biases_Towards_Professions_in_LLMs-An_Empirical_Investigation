The asphalt shimmered under the relentless Nevada sun, turning the world into a hazy mirage.  Dust devils danced on the horizon, kicking up swirls of red dirt that stung Elias Blackwood's eyes. He squinted, wiping a grimy hand across his forehead, leaving a streak of grease in its wake. The air vibrated with the drone of cicadas and the distant rumble of eighteen-wheelers thundering down Interstate 80.

Elias was alone on this stretch today. His partner, Jim, had called in sick with something that sounded suspiciously like a hangover. Elias didn't judge. This job could wear you down, mile after monotonous mile. Still, he preferred having someone else around. The silence, broken only by the hiss of his compressed air hose and the occasional shriek of a hawk overhead, was unnerving.

He was patching a section of cracked pavement near Exit 237 when a glint of metal caught his eye. Half-buried in the dust along the shoulder, a battered silver thermos lay forgotten. Elias knelt down, brushing away the grit. It looked old, scratched and dented, with faded red lettering on the side that read "Hope Springs Diner." A strange shiver ran down his spine. He'd never seen that diner before, and he knew this stretch of highway like the back of his hand.
