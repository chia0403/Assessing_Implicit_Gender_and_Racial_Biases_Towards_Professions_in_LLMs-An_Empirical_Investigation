The rasping whine of Ezra Blackwood's chisel against granite filled the cavernous workshop with an almost musical rhythm. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing in its path. Outside, the bustling port town of Saltwind teemed with life, but here, within the cool embrace of stone and shadow, Ezra found solace.

He ran his calloused thumb over the curve of a cherub's cheek he was carving, smoothing away imperfections with practiced ease. The marble, imported from distant lands, felt cool and smooth beneath his touch. It was destined to adorn a wealthy merchant's tomb, a testament to a life lived in opulence even in death. 

But Ezra didn't envy the merchants their riches. His world was carved in stone â€“ the hard edges of granite tombstones, the delicate curves of angels sculpted from alabaster, the sturdy lines of fountains destined for grand courtyards. Each piece he touched held a story waiting to be told, and Ezra felt privileged to be its voice.
