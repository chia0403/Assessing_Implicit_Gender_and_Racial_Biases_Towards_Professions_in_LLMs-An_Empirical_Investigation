The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead in the brightly coloured playroom, casting long, dancing shadows on the mismatched carpet. Evelyn Rose Cartwright sighed, tugging at the collar of her scratchy uniform shirt. Six sticky fingers clambered onto her leg, demanding attention with a chorus of "Evelyn! Up! Up!"

Evelyn scooped up three-year-old Leo, his cherubic face smeared with what she hoped was just jam. The air hung heavy with the scent of crayons, disinfectant, and something vaguely metallic - probably from the construction toy Liam had inevitably dismantled again. Outside, the wind rattled the windows of the Sunshine Daycare Centre, a dreary symphony that mirrored Evelyn's own mood. 

It was just another Tuesday, but lately, Tuesdays felt heavier than Mondays. A creeping sense of dissatisfaction gnawed at her. This wasn't what she envisioned when she graduated with her Early Childhood Education degree. Where were the inspiring moments, the genuine connections? All she felt was exhaustion and a growing disconnect from the joy she used to find in nurturing young minds.
