The aroma of caramelized sugar hung thick in the air, clinging to Esmeralda "Esme" Bellweather's apron like a second skin. Dawn was barely breaking over the cobbled streets of Port Blossom, casting long shadows from the crooked gables and overflowing window boxes that lined the harbor. Esme kneaded dough with practiced ease, her strong arms working rhythmically as she hummed along to the faint melody drifting in from the bakery next door - a jaunty tune played on an old tin whistle. Her small shop, "Esme's Delights," was tucked away down a narrow alley, its window display a tempting tableau of golden croissants, jewel-toned fruit tarts, and loaves of sourdough still warm from the oven. Today was market day, and Esme knew the crowd would be hungry for her creations. 


But as she shaped a batch of cinnamon rolls, a tremor ran through the cobblestones beneath her feet, followed by an unnerving silence that seemed to swallow even the chirping sparrows outside.  Esme paused, her dough-covered hands hovering in mid-air. Something wasn't right.
