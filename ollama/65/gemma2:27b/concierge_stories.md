The gilded doors of The Grand Majestic swung open with a pneumatic sigh, ushering in another wave of tourists gawking at the marble floors and crystal chandeliers. Elodie Beaumont adjusted her silk scarf, the ruby brooch glinting under the chandelier's warm glow, and plastered on her practiced smile. As head concierge of The Grand Majestic, one of London's most opulent hotels, Elodie was trained to anticipate every whim, every desire, before it even crossed a guest's mind.

But today, something felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thick as the Earl Grey she served each morning in the opulent drawing-room. It started with the cryptic message delivered by a raven-haired courier just past dawn: "The Falcon arrives at dusk." Elodie had dismissed it as another eccentric request from one of her high-profile guests, but a shiver still danced down her spine.

Dusk was approaching, casting long shadows across the ornate lobby, when the elevator doors opened with an uncharacteristic clang. A figure emerged, shrouded in darkness, their features obscured by the shadows cast by a wide-brimmed hat. Elodie's practiced smile faltered. This wasn't one of her usual guests.

This was something else entirely.
