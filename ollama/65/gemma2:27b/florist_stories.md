Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the already fading colors of the autumn leaves swirling on the cobblestone street outside. Inside "The Blooming Heart," Amelia Rose Hawthorne meticulously arranged crimson roses into a cascading bouquet, her brow furrowed in concentration. The scent of lilies and lavender, normally comforting, felt oppressive today.

A bell chimed as the shop door creaked open, bringing with it a gust of wind and a figure huddled against the storm.  Amelia looked up from her work, expecting to see a drenched customer seeking shelter. Instead, she saw a man standing in the doorway, his face obscured by the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat. 

His eyes, when they met hers, were an unsettling shade of green, like moss glistening after a downpour. He held out a wilted dandelion, its once vibrant yellow faded to a pale whisper. "Can you bring this back?" he asked, his voice low and raspy.  Amelia's hand instinctively tightened around the rose stems. Something about the man and his request felt unnervingly wrong.
