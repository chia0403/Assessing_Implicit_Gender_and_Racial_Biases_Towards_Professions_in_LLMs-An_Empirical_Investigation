Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street.  Elias Finch adjusted his spectacles, the greasy smudges doing little to improve his already blurry vision. The fluorescent lights overhead hummed a monotonous tune, mirroring the ceaseless thrumming anxiety in his gut.

He was hunched over his drafting table, blueprints sprawled before him like forgotten dreams. Elias wasn't an architect, not really. He was a draftsman, a cog in the vast machine of urban development. He took the grand visions of others - sleek skyscrapers piercing the clouds, sprawling shopping malls teeming with life - and translated them into intricate lines and precise measurements. 

But tonight, inspiration seemed as distant as the stars obscured by the relentless rain. His latest assignment, a monolithic office complex for some faceless corporation, felt soul-crushingly mundane. The lines blurred together, mocking his weary eyes. He longed for something more, something beyond the sterile confines of concrete and glass.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled him from his reverie. Elias hesitated, surprised by the unexpected visitor at this late hour.  He rose cautiously, wiping his hands on his already stained apron.

Who could it be?
