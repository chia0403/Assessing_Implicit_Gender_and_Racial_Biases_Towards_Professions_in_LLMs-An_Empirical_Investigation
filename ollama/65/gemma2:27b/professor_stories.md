The pungent aroma of old books and pipe tobacco clung to Professor Elias Thorne like a second skin. It was a scent he'd grown accustomed to over his fifty years at Blackwood University, a venerable institution nestled amidst the rolling emerald hills of Vermont. His office, tucked away on the third floor of the ancient Humanities Building, was a sanctuary of towering mahogany bookshelves crammed with leather-bound volumes and yellowed manuscripts. Sunlight filtered through the grime-coated windows, casting long shadows across his cluttered desk piled high with essays, research papers, and a half-eaten apple core. Elias, a man whose silver hair mirrored the streaks in his tweed jacket, peered intently at a faded papyrus scroll, its hieroglyphs whispering secrets of a forgotten age. A sudden rapping on the door startled him, momentarily breaking his concentration. 

"Come in," he called, his voice gravelly from years of lecturing and late-night pipe smoking.
