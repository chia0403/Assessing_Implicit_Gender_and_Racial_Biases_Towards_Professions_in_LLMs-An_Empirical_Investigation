The Parisian sun sliced through the gauzy curtains, casting stripes across Eliza Beaumont's worn drafting table. She squinted, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her messy bun. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the faint, sweet aroma of lilies from the vase perched precariously on a stack of design magazines. Outside her window, the rhythmic clatter of the Metro and the murmur of vendors setting up their stalls painted a familiar Parisian morning soundscape.

Eliza sighed, tracing the lines of her latest project: a sprawling Belle Ã‰poque apartment in Montmartre, its bones begging for a revival that honored both its history and the modern sensibilities of its new owners. This wasn't just another job; it was Eliza's chance to make her mark on the city she adored, to weave her own story into the intricate tapestry of Parisian life.
