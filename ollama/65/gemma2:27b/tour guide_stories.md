Rain lashed against the windows of the rickety coach, mimicking the relentless drumming in Beatrice "Bea" Cavendish's chest. She gripped the worn leather steering wheel tighter, her knuckles bone white against the mahogany. Outside, the Scottish Highlands were shrouded in mist, their ancient peaks obscured by the swirling grey curtain. Bea usually relished the moody beauty of her homeland, but today, with a coach full of apprehensive tourists and a storm threatening to swallow them whole, she felt anything but at peace. 

Their destination: Eilean Donan Castle, perched dramatically on a tidal island where three lochs converged. A beacon of history and legend, it was the crown jewel of Bea's tours, usually drawing gasps of awe from her passengers. Today, however, the castle seemed as distant and foreboding as the storm clouds themselves.
