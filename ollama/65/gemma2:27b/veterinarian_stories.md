Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop echoing like a tiny hammer blow in the otherwise quiet room. Emilia Beatrice Thorne adjusted her spectacles and peered out the grimy windowpane. Dusk was settling over Hollow Creek, painting the sky in bruised hues of purple and grey. The wind whipped through the ancient oak trees lining Main Street, their skeletal branches clawing at the darkening clouds. 

Emilia sighed, running a hand through her already dishevelled auburn hair. Another slow day.  She glanced at the lone patient chart on her desk – Bartholomew, a portly pug with an unfortunate case of indigestion. It wasn't exactly the thrilling work she'd envisioned when she'd moved from bustling Chicago to this sleepy Appalachian town six months ago. 

But Hollow Creek had its charm. There was something undeniably peaceful about the rhythm of life here, a sense of community that Emilia hadn't felt in years. And then there were the animals. Bartholomew, with his mournful eyes and rumbling tummy, was just one of many quirky creatures she’d grown to adore.  

Suddenly, a frantic rapping on the clinic door jolted her from her musings. Emilia straightened up, curiosity piqued. It was far too late for routine appointments. Who could be out in this weather?
