Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Microphone, blurring the neon "OPEN MIC NIGHT" sign into an indistinguishable smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, greasy fries, and desperation. Eleanor Grace Hawthorne adjusted her microphone, the cheap plastic cold against her palm. Her voice, usually a soaring instrument capable of reaching the highest notes with effortless grace, felt tight, constricted by the weight of unshed tears and a year's worth of disappointments. 

This was it. Her last shot. The talent scout from Stellar Records, notorious for unearthing raw gems, was rumored to be in the audience tonight. Eleanor needed this break like she needed air. If she didnâ€™t impress him, her dream of becoming a professional singer would likely fade away, another casualty of the unforgiving music industry.
