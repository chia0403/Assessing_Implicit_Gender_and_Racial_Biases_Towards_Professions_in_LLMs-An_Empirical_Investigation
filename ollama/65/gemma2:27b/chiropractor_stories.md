The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling purple glow onto Amelia Blackwood's tired face. "Blackwood Chiropractic: Align Your Spine, Align Your Life" it proclaimed, the slogan feeling more ironic than inspiring these days. Rain lashed against the windows of her small office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Five years ago, she'd dreamed of helping people find relief from chronic pain, envisioning a practice filled with grateful patients.

Instead, she was staring at a dwindling appointment book and a stack of overdue bills. The quaint seaside town of Port Blossom, once promising, now felt like a cage. Its residents seemed content with their aches and pains, preferring to visit the local pub for a pint than seek out Amelia's healing touch. 


The clock ticked mercilessly towards closing time. A lone patient was due any minute â€“ Mrs. Peterson, whose back always popped ominously during adjustments. Amelia sighed, wondering if she should pack it in and move somewhere with more "chiropractic hunger." But the thought of abandoning her dream felt like admitting defeat.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled her. Before Amelia could even rise, the door swung open, revealing a figure silhouetted against the stormy night.
