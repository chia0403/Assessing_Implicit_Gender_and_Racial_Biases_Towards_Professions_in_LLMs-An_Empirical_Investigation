Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frenzied rhythm of Elara Rosethorne's fingers on her ancient typewriter. The musty scent of decaying paperbacks mingled with the damp chill seeping in from the cracks in the aging walls, creating an atmosphere thick with both inspiration and despair. Elara squinted at the page before her, the words blurring under the dim glow of a single oil lamp. "The Raven's Shadow," her latest gothic horror novel, was proving to be more challenging than anticipated. 

Outside, thunder rumbled like a distant monster awakening, momentarily plunging the attic into darkness. Elara sighed, leaning back in her creaking wooden chair. The weight of writer's block pressed down on her like the leaden sky above. Perhaps she needed fresh air, a change of scenery. Or maybe...a muse.
