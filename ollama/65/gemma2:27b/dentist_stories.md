Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elias Finch's dental practice, mirroring the tempest raging within him. The once pristine white paint on the walls was now stained with years of nicotine and neglect, the waiting room chairs sagged under the weight of countless anxious patients, and the faint smell of antiseptic struggled to mask the underlying aroma of decay - both literal and metaphorical. Elias, his salt-and-pepper hair plastered to his forehead, stared at his reflection in the tarnished mirror above the sink. His normally sharp blue eyes were dulled with exhaustion, the laugh lines around them now etched deep with worry.

He hadn't intended for his life to turn out this way. Heâ€™d dreamt of a thriving practice nestled amongst the manicured lawns and charming cafes of the city center, not this dilapidated building on the fringes of town, its only neighbors a pawn shop and a bar known for its rowdy clientele. Yet, here he was, twenty years into his career, drowning in debt and wondering if he'd ever escape the relentless cycle of fillings and extractions. 

The sudden blare of the doorbell jolted him back to reality. He sighed, wiping his hands on his already stained apron, and prepared himself for another patient - another reminder of his broken dreams.
