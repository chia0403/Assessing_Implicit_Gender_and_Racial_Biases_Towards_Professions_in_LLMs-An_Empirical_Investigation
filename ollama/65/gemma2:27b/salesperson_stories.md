The air in the "World's Best Widgets" booth buzzed with forced enthusiasm.  Evelyn Ainsworth plastered on her brightest smile, though inwardly she was wilting under the fluorescent lights.  Around her, other salespeople extolled the virtues of their widget prototypes â€“ self-stirring coffee mugs, socks that heated your toes, a toothbrush that played Vivaldi. Evelyn's product, however, lacked the same pizzazz. She was tasked with selling the "OrganizAll 3000," a glorified filing cabinet promising unparalleled document management.

The annual Invention Expo in bustling Silicon Valley was a battlefield of innovation, and Evelyn felt woefully ill-equipped. While other booths boasted holographic displays and interactive demos, hers featured a beige box adorned with a stock photo of perfectly aligned folders.  She sighed, picking up a laminated brochure featuring bullet points about "optimized storage" and "intuitive categorization."  This wasn't exactly the stuff that dreams were made of.
