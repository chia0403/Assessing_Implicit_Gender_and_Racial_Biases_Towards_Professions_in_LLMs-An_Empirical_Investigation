Rain lashed against the windows of "Kinetic Recovery," blurring the neon sign's cheerful promise of healing into an abstract watercolour. Inside, Evelyn Sinclair sighed, watching the grey sky bleed into twilight. The day had been slow, filled with cancellations and insurance headaches - the usual frustrations for a small-town physical therapist. She idly traced her finger along the worn spine of a anatomy textbook, longing for the days when she'd dreamed of treating Olympic athletes, not Mrs. Henderson's creaky hip.

But then, the bell above the door chimed, shattering the silence. Evelyn straightened, a flicker of hope igniting within her. It wasn't often new patients walked in on rainy Tuesday evenings.  A tall figure, shrouded in shadow and dripping rainwater, filled the doorway. They hesitated for a moment, before stepping inside, their face still obscured by the hood they wore. 

Evelyn felt an inexplicable shiver run down her spine. Something about this patient, even hidden as they were, sent a prickle of unease through her.
