Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of Agnes Thistlewick's office, blurring the already indistinct view of the cobblestone street below. The air inside was thick with the scent of aged paper and ink, punctuated by the rhythmic clattering of Agnes's antique adding machine. Her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose as she meticulously tallied the expenses for Mr. Bartholomew Quillfeather's latest import shipment – a crate of exotic tea leaves from the faraway Orient. 

Agnes Thistlewick, a woman of precise habits and an even more precise mind, relished the orderliness of numbers. In her world, every decimal point held meaning, every ledger entry a piece in a grand, intricate puzzle. But tonight, even the soothing rhythm of her work couldn't quite quell the unease that gnawed at her. The rain seemed to echo the turmoil brewing within her – a storm fueled by whispers and rumours circulating through the fog-choked streets of Grimsborough.
