The insistent chirping of cicadas punctuated the humid Louisiana air as Eloise Beaumont adjusted her straw hat, its wide brim casting a welcome shadow over her face. The scent of honeysuckle hung heavy, mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly tilled soil. Eloise surveyed the sprawling community garden before her, rows upon rows of vibrant green vegetables promising a bountiful harvest. Sweat beaded on her brow as she crouched down, inspecting a patch of wilting collard greens. 

"Too much sun," she muttered to herself, mentally noting to suggest afternoon shade cloths for this particular section. Eloise wasn't just any nutritionist; she was a culinary crusader, dedicated to bringing fresh, healthy food to underserved communities in her home state. Today's mission: revitalizing the neglected garden of St. Jude's Community Center, a haven for seniors grappling with limited access to nutritious meals.
