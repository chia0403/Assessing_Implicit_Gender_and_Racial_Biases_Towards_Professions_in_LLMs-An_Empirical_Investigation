The scent of sawdust and pine needles hung thick in the air, clinging to Silas Blackwood's calloused fingers like an affectionate ghost. He stood back, surveying his work: a rocking chair carved from a single slab of oak, its arms curving like gentle embraces, the seat smooth as a river stone. The late afternoon sun, filtering through the gaps in the wooden walls of his workshop, gilded the wood with a warm glow. Outside, the wind whistled through the pines that clung to the hillside, their scent carried on the breeze and mingling with the sawdust aroma. Silas Blackwood's workshop wasn't just a place of work; it was an extension of himself, a sanctuary nestled in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains where he could pour his soul into the grain of the wood.
