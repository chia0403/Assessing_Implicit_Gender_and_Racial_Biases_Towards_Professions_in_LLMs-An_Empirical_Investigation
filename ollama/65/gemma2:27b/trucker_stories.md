The greasy spoon diner hummed with the clatter of plates and the murmur of tired conversations. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon glow of the "Big Rig Diner" sign into a hazy orange blob.  Aiden Blackwood, his hands calloused and strong from years on the road, sat hunched over a mug of lukewarm coffee. The steam barely managed to reach his face, obscured as it was by a bushy beard the color of rust. He glanced at the clock ticking away on the wall - 3:17 AM.

His rig, "The Iron Horse," stood idling in the rain-slicked parking lot, its chrome gleaming like a beacon in the gloom. Aiden had been hauling cargo across the country for over two decades, his life a tapestry woven from endless highways, desolate truck stops, and fleeting encounters with strangers. But tonight, something felt different. A gnawing unease twisted in his gut, a premonition he couldn't shake off.
