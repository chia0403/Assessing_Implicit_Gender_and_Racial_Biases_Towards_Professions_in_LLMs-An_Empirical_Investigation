The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead in the sterile white waiting room, casting a sickly green hue over everything. Penelope "Penny" Hawthorne sighed, adjusting her teal scrubs for what felt like the hundredth time that morning. The air hung thick with a mixture of disinfectant and anxious anticipation, punctuated by the occasional hacking cough or nervous giggle. Penny glanced at the clock: 9:57 AM. Seven minutes until her first patient.

She was already dreading it. Mr. Henderson, a regular for his monthly blood work, was notorious for being a squirmer, turning even the most gentle needle prick into an epic struggle.  Penny loved her job, truly she did, but some days the monotony and occasional unpleasant encounter felt like a heavy weight on her shoulders.

Today, however, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a tingling at the back of Penny's neck. It was as if the waiting room itself held its breath, awaiting something unknown. The silence grew thicker, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the clock on the wall. Then, the double doors swung open with a bang, ushering in a gust of wind and...something else. Something Penny couldn't quite name, but felt deep within her bones.

A tall figure, cloaked in shadows, stood silhouetted against the bright morning sun streaming through the doorway.  Penny froze, her heart hammering in her chest. Who was this stranger? And what did their arrival portend for a seemingly ordinary day at Willow Creek Medical Center?
