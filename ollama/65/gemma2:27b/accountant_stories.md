Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. Inside his cramped office, Theodore Percival Finch meticulously balanced a ledger, the rhythmic tapping of his antique adding machine a counterpoint to the storm's fury.  Theodore wasn't one for excitement. He preferred order, balance, and the comforting certainty of numbers. Yet, tonight, something felt different. The air crackled with an unseen energy, and even the stale smell of old paper seemed tinged with something unusual. A knock on the door, sharp and unexpected, shattered Theodore's concentration. His heart skipped a beat, a sensation unfamiliar in his otherwise predictable life.  He pushed his spectacles up his nose and straightened his tie, bracing himself for whatever awaited him beyond the threshold.
