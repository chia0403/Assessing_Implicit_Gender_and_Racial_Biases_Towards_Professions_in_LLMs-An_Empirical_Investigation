Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of "Smile Bright Dental" into an impressionistic smear.  Inside, Amelia Kensington sighed, her breath fogging the cool glass for a fleeting moment before dissipating. The rhythmic clatter of the dental instruments cleaning station had become a lullaby in the unusually quiet afternoon.  Normally, Mondays were a whirlwind of appointments and anxious patients, but today, only Mrs. Henderson's 2 pm checkup remained on the schedule. Amelia glanced at the clock â€“ it was already 1:45.

She straightened the neatly folded bibs on her tray, smoothing out imaginary wrinkles. Boredom was creeping in, threatening to dull the usual sharp focus she brought to her work.  Amelia prided herself on being more than just a teeth cleaner; she was a patient advocate, a calming presence amidst dental anxiety. But with no one to soothe, no smiles to brighten, she felt adrift. The incessant rain only amplified her sense of isolation. 


What happens next? Will Mrs. Henderson show up? Or will Amelia find another way to fill the unexpected quiet?
