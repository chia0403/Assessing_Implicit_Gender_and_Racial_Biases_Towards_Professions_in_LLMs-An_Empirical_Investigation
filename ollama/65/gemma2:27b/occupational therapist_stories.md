Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the already muted colours of the autumnal landscape outside.  Eleanor Hayes sighed, her breath fogging the glass momentarily before dissipating into the damp air. The small OT clinic she ran was nestled on the edge of a sleepy coastal town, its quaint charm now lost beneath a dreary veil of grey. 

Despite the weather, Eleanor had a patient waiting. A young boy named Finn, struggling with the aftermath of a debilitating accident. Today, they were working on his fine motor skills, something he'd once taken for granted, but now seemed impossibly complex.  Eleanor glanced at the colourful toys scattered around the brightly-painted room – building blocks, puzzles, playdough – tools designed to bridge the gap between what was and what could be.

A faint knock broke through her thoughts. "Finn's here," came a muffled voice from the other side of the door. Eleanor straightened, steeling herself for the challenge ahead. Finn's journey wouldn't be easy, but she was determined to walk beside him, each small victory a beacon of hope in the storm.
