Rain lashed against the windows of Serene Touch Massage Therapy, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia Rose Hawthorne. Her normally placid lavender-scented sanctuary felt stifling tonight. The rhythmic dripping from a leaky pipe somewhere above echoed her own mounting anxiety.  

Amelia, with her gentle touch and intuitive understanding of the human body, prided herself on being a calming presence for her clients. Yet, she was anything but calm. Tonight marked the deadline for the lease renewal on her beloved practice, and Mr. Henderson, her landlord, had yet to respond to her numerous calls and emails. The thought of losing Serene Touch, a haven she'd poured her heart and soul into building over the past five years, was unbearable.
