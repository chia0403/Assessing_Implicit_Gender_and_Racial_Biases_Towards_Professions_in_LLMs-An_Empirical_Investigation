Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Esmeralda "Esme" Thorne's attic studio, each drop a frantic drumbeat against the silence within. The air hung thick with the scent of turpentine and drying linseed oil, tinged with a hint of desperation. Esme hunched over her easel, a tangle of fiery red curls escaping her loose bun as she stared at the canvas before her. It was supposed to be a masterpiece, a vibrant portrayal of the city skyline at twilight, but all she saw were smudged colours and lifeless lines.

Her fingers trembled as they gripped the paintbrush, frustration gnawing at her. For weeks, inspiration had been a fickle visitor, leaving her with blank canvases and mounting bills. The once-bright walls of her studio were now cluttered with unfinished works, each one a testament to her dwindling hope. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempest brewing within her soul. Tonight, Esme knew, she needed more than just inspiration; she needed a miracle.
