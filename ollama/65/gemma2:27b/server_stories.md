The neon sign outside flickered with tired defiance, casting an anemic green glow over Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes as she hurried through the back alley towards The Rusty Sprocket.  Rain hammered against the corrugated iron rooftops, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of spray. Ellie tugged her faded denim jacket tighter around herself, wishing for the hundredth time that she'd remembered to grab an umbrella from the overflowing coat rack by the staff entrance.

The Rusty Sprocket was nestled in a forgotten corner of the city's industrial district, a greasy spoon diner clinging to life amongst abandoned warehouses and hulking, rusting machinery. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled aromas of frying bacon, stale coffee, and disinfectant – a comforting olfactory cocktail Ellie had come to associate with home.

Tonight, however, The Rusty Sprocket felt different. An unsettling quiet permeated the usually bustling space. Only a handful of regulars occupied their usual booths, hunched over steaming mugs and greasy plates, their faces etched with concern.  Ellie’s stomach clenched. Something was wrong.
