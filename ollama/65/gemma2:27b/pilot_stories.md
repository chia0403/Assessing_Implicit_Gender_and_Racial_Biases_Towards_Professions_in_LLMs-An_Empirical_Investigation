The wind howled like a banshee through the rusted struts of the abandoned hangar, whistling a mournful tune that echoed Amelia "Ace" Hawthorne's own restless spirit. Dust motes danced in the pale morning light filtering through the gaps in the corrugated iron roof, illuminating the skeletal remains of forgotten aircraft scattered across the concrete floor. Ace adjusted the worn leather strap of her duffel bag, the weight of her tools pressing against her hip. 

This hangar, a relic from a bygone era when the skies hummed with life and adventure, was now her sanctuary. It smelled of oil, grease, and faded dreams â€“ a scent that felt strangely comforting.  Ace traced her fingers along the chipped paint of a moth-eaten biplane, its wings drooping like a weary bird. This place, this forgotten corner of the world, was where she planned to rebuild her own wings, both literally and figuratively.
