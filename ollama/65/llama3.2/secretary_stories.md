Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she pushed open the heavy wooden door to the office building, Emily Alexandra Jenkins felt a familiar sense of trepidation wash over her. It was 7:00 AM on a typical Monday morning in downtown Chicago, and the bustling streets were already alive with the hum of traffic and the chatter of pedestrians rushing to start their day.

Emily took a deep breath, shouldering her worn leather tote bag as she made her way down the long hallway lined with cubicles. She had worked as the secretary for the prestigious law firm of Smith, Johnson, and Thompson for five years, and while it was a comfortable and stable job, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing.

As she approached her own small office, Emily noticed a strange envelope waiting on her desk. It was addressed to her in elegant script, with no return address and no indication of who might have sent it. The postmark read "Yesterday" - a date that was now three days old, but still seemed jarringly current.

Emily's curiosity got the better of her as she picked up the envelope, her fingers tracing the embossed seal on its surface. It was a symbol she didn't recognize, and yet, somehow, it felt eerily familiar. She slipped her finger under the flap and pulled out the contents - a small piece of paper with a single sentence scrawled upon it: "The truth about your past is waiting for you in the files."
