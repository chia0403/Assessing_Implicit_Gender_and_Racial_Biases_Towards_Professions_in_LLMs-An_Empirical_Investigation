Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The sun had just set over the bustling streets of downtown Oakland, casting a warm orange glow over the vibrant murals that lined the walls of the alleyways. Amidst the thrum of music and laughter spilling out of the bars on 18th Street, Phoebe Alexandra Thompson stood quietly in the corner of her workplace, the sound of the dialysis machines humming softly in the background.

As a phlebotomist at the Bay Area Dialysis Center, Phoebe had spent countless hours collecting blood samples from patients undergoing life-sustaining treatments for kidney failure and other chronic conditions. She took pride in her work, earning the nickname "The Blood Whisperer" among her colleagues for her uncanny ability to coax even the most reluctant patients into submission.

As she worked, Phoebe's mind wandered to the mysterious letter she'd received that morning – a cryptic message scrawled on a plain white envelope with no return address. The words danced in her head like a mantra: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone." Phoebe had always been skeptical of such whispers, but something about this particular note resonated deep within her.

With a quiet sigh, she refocused on the task at hand, carefully inserting a new needle into a patient's vein and collecting a vial of blood with practiced ease. Little did she know that this ordinary day was about to take an extraordinary turn – one that would shatter the tranquility of her routine and set Phoebe Alexandra Thompson on a collision course with secrets, danger, and transformation.
