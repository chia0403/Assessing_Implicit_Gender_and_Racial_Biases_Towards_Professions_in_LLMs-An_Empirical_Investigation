Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a dietician as the main character:

The sun had just set over the bustling streets of downtown Manhattan, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and crowded sidewalks. Inside the sleek, modern lobby of the prestigious New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, Dr. Sophia Maria Rodriguez was sipping on a cup of coffee and staring at her phone with a mixture of frustration and dread.

As a registered dietician and nutrition expert, Sophia had spent years working in some of the top hospitals and research institutions around the world, helping patients overcome eating disorders, manage chronic illnesses, and make healthy lifestyle choices. But despite her impressive credentials and success, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was missing from her life.

Sophia's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend and colleague, Dr. Rachel Kim: "Hey, Sophia! Just got word that our hospital is hosting a high-profile conference on nutrition and wellness next month. Want to come present?"

Sophia hesitated for a moment before typing out a response: "I'm in. What's the topic?"

Rachel responded with an enthusiastic emoji and a brief summary of the conference theme: "It's all about 'Revolutionizing Nutrition and Wellness in the Digital Age'! The hospital is partnering with a major tech company to develop a new line of health-tracking apps, and we're invited to present on our expertise in nutrition science."

Sophia raised an eyebrow as she read the text. A tech company? Was this really going to be about "revolutionizing" nutrition? She wasn't so sure...
