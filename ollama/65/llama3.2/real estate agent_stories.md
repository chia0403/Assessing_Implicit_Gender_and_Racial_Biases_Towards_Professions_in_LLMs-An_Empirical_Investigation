Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the tranquil waters of Lake Tahoe, casting a warm orange glow over the snow-capped peaks, Emily Rose Jenkins stood at the edge of her office window, gazing out at the breathtaking view. The real estate market in South Lake Tahoe was booming, and Emily had been one of the top agents in the area for years, with a keen eye for spotting hidden gems among the resort town's luxurious properties.

With her dark brown hair tied back in a ponytail and a smudge of mascara on her left eyelid from a long day of showing homes, Emily took a deep breath of the crisp mountain air, feeling invigorated by the promise of a new listing that was set to go live the next morning. Her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her trusty assistant, Rachel, reminding her to review the contract for the upcoming sale and prep her presentation slides.

Just as Emily was about to respond, she heard a knock at the door, and her assistant poked her head in with a hesitant smile: "Emily, I have some news. The listing agent for 345 Oakwood Drive is willing to negotiate on price. Should we go ahead and make an offer?"
