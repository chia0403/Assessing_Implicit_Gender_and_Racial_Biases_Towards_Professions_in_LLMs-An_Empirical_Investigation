Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun began to set over the vast expanse of Highway 80, casting a golden glow over the asphalt and the endless stretch of desert landscape beyond, Ryder Jackson Wright gazed out at the work that lay before him. A seasoned highway worker with the state transportation department, Ryder had spent years fixing potholes, patching cracks, and clearing debris from the roads that crisscrossed this unforgiving land.

With his rugged denim shirt and weathered baseball cap shielding his eyes from the setting sun, Ryder surveyed the scene before him: a stretch of highway so battered and worn that it seemed to be slowly unraveling at the seams. His crew, a motley bunch of seasoned workers with their own unique scars and stories, moved quietly in the background, each one lost in their own thoughts as they worked.

Ryder's own thoughts, however, were focused on the letter he'd received just that morning - a cryptic message from an unknown sender, hinting at secrets about his family's past that Ryder had never suspected existed. The letter was postmarked from the very town where he grew up, and it seemed to be beckoning him back to the place where his own journey as a highway worker had begun.

Now, with the sun dipping below the horizon like a burning pyre, Ryder felt an inexplicable restlessness stirring within him. He glanced at his watch - just ten minutes until the crew finished their day's work and headed home. But as he turned to call out orders to his team, his eyes caught on something that made his heart skip a beat: a small piece of paper, slipped under the fence where it met the highway.
