Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Portland, Oregon glistened like polished onyx as Dr. Emily Victoria Thompson stepped out of her small pharmacy, "Thompson's Medicines," and onto the misty morning air. The scent of wet earth and ozone filled her lungs as she lit a cigarette, the first one she'd smoked in years, to calm her nerves.

It was 6:00 AM on a typical Wednesday, with the sun still hiding behind the towering fir trees that lined the city's main street. Inside the pharmacy, the soft hum of the refrigerators and the gentle chatter of the early morning customers created a soothing background noise that Emily found comforting.

As she exhaled, Emily gazed out at the deserted streets, her mind already racing with the day's tasks and patients to attend to. She had always loved being a pharmacist, but lately, the weight of responsibility and the pressure to meet demanding pharmaceutical company targets had taken its toll. The stress was starting to seep into her personal life, too.

Emily took one last drag on her cigarette before flicking it into the gutter, a habit she'd broken for weeks now, but couldn't seem to shake off completely. She let out a sigh and headed back inside, ready to face whatever the day had in store for her and her struggling pharmacy.
