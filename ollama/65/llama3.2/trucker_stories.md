The sun had just begun to set over the vast expanse of the Texas panhandle, casting a golden glow over the deserted highway that stretched out before Ryder Jackson Thompson like a lifeless serpent. As the wheels of his Peterbilt 359 rumbled along, the soft hum of the engine and the occasional creak of the suspension were the only sounds that broke the stillness of the evening air.
