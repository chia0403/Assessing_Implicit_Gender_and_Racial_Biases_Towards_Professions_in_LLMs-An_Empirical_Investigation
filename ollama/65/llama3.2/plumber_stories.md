Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain poured down on the small town of Willow Creek like a relentless curtain, casting a gloomy mist over the streets and alleys. Inside the cramped office of "McTavish & Sons Plumbing", Jack McTavish hunched over his computer, trying to make sense of the latest bill from the city's water department. As he sipped his lukewarm coffee, he stared out the steam-streaked window at the soggy streets below.

Jack was a fixture in Willow Creek - 45 years old, married to Sarah with two kids, and owner of the plumbing business that had been in his family for generations. He took pride in knowing every pipe and fixture in town, from the creaky old radiator in Mrs. Jenkins' bungalow to the high-tech sprinkler system at the city's new sports complex.

But despite his reputation as the go-to plumber for Willow Creek, Jack was feeling restless. A recent visit to his father's grave had stirred up old doubts about leaving the business to his son, Jamie - who was more interested in playing video games than fixing leaky faucets. As he gazed out into the rain-soaked night, Jack wondered if it was time for a change.

Just then, the phone on his desk jolted him out of his reverie. "McTavish & Sons Plumbing" flashed on the screen, and Jack's hand instinctively reached for the receiver. Who - or what - would be calling him at this hour?
