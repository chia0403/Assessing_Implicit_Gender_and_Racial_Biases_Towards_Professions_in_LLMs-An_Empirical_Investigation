Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the first light of dawn crept over the rolling hills of Willowdale Manor, groundskeeper Edwin Trevor Fletcher set to work tending to the manicured lawns and gardens that had been his pride and joy for nearly a decade. The misty morning air clung to his thick coat like a damp shroud as he walked along the winding paths, inspecting the rows of perfectly pruned hedges and the beds of vibrant flowers.

The once-grand estate, built in the late 19th century by a wealthy industrialist, had seen better days. Now, after decades of decline, it stood as a testament to the fleeting nature of wealth and status. Yet, despite its faded grandeur, Willowdale Manor still held a certain allure, a whisper of secrets and stories that only the most attuned ears could detect.

Edwin, with his rugged features and weathered skin, had always been drawn to the manor's mysterious energy. As a young boy, he would spend hours exploring the overgrown gardens and hidden corners of the estate, imagining himself as a brave adventurer in a world of wonder and enchantment. Now, as a groundskeeper, he felt like a guardian of sorts, tasked with preserving the beauty and charm of this forgotten place.

As he made his way to the stables to collect the day's trash, Edwin couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The usually silent birds seemed louder than usual, and the wind carried an undercurrent of tension that sent shivers down his spine. Little did he know, today would be a day like any other â€“ or perhaps one that would change everything forever.
