Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Everley Rae Thompson stood in front of the large windows of her office, gazing out at the grey, mist-shrouded streets of Seattle as she sipped her lukewarm coffee. The drizzle outside seemed to seep into every pore of the city, casting a melancholy veil over the towering skyscrapers and bustling sidewalks. Everley's own world was one of sterile precision, where the faint scent of antiseptic and the soft beeps of medical equipment were the only sounds that broke the silence.

As a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon at the prestigious Seattle General Hospital, Everley had spent years honing her craft, sacrificing sleep and social relationships in the process. Her dedication to saving lives had earned her a reputation as one of the top surgeons in the city, but it had also taken a toll on her personal life. Her relationships were few and far between, and those she did have felt suffocated by the constant demands of her job.

As she gazed out at the rain-soaked city, Everley's thoughts turned to the latest patient she was scheduled to operate on - a young mother with a rare heart condition that threatened to claim her life. The weight of responsibility settled heavy on Everley's shoulders, and for a moment, she wondered if it was all worth it.
