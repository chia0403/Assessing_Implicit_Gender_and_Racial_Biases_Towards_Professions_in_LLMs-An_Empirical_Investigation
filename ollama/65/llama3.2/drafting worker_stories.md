It was a typical winter morning in this part of town, where the worn brick facades seemed to absorb what little light there was, and the air reeked of smoke and wet earth.

In his small workshop, tucked away on a quiet alleyway off Deansgate, Alfie Fletcher hunched over his drafting board, his eyes scanning the intricate drawings etched onto the transparent paper. As a skilled drafting worker, he spent most of his days conjuring up blueprints for Manchester's fledgling architecture firms – buildings that would soon sprout from the very streets he called home.
