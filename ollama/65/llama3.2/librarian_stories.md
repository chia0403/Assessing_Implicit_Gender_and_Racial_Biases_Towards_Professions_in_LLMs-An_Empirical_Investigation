Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most melancholy during the autumn evenings, when the last wisps of summer's warmth had dissipated and the air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. It was on one such evening that Ember Rose Wellington, a bookish and introverted librarian in her mid-thirties, stood behind the circulation desk at Ravenswood Public Library, watching as the rain lashed against the windows like a chorus of restless spirits.

The library's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an eerie glow over the rows of shelves lined with dusty tomes and worn paperbacks. Ember's eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed to hold a world of wisdom behind them, were fixed on the display case in front of her, where a new shipment of books had arrived that morning. Among them, one title in particular caught her eye: "The Echoes of Blackwood House", a long-forgotten novel about a family's dark legacy and the secrets hidden within its crumbling walls.

As she stood there, lost in thought, the sound of the rain and the hum of the lights seemed to fade into the background, leaving only the soft ticking of the clock on the wall and the thrumming of her own heart, which beat with a sense of restlessness that she couldn't quite explain. Little did Ember know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take her down dark alleys, hidden passages, and into the very heart of Ravenswood's most sinister secrets.
