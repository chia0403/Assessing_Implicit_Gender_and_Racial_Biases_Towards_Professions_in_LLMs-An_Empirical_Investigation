Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

The sun had just set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the crumbling pier that jutted out into the misty lake. Amidst the rusty fishing nets and worn wooden planks, Emilia "Mia" Thompson stood poised with her camera, waiting for the perfect shot.

As a documentary photographer, Mia had spent countless hours capturing the gritty beauty of Ravenswood's industrial landscape. She had grown up here, watching as her family's small hardware store struggled to stay afloat in the face of big-box chains and online shopping. But it was the people – the gruff fishermen, the weathered dockworkers, the retired factory workers who still held onto their tools like they were badges of honor – that truly told Ravenswood's story.

Mia's eyes scanned the pier, her gaze lingering on the faint outline of a lone seagull perched atop a weathered pile of crates. She raised her camera to her eye and snapped off a few test shots, her finger hovering over the shutter release as she searched for the perfect moment to capture the essence of Ravenswood.

Little did Mia know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take her to the very heart of the town's secrets – and the darkest corners of its past.
