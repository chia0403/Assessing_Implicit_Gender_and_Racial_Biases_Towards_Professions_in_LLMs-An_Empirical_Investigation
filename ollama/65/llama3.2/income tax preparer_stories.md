Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring an income tax preparer as the main character:

It was a chilly spring morning in late March when Emily Anne Wilson stepped out of her small apartment above her family's old brick building on Main Street, Uptown. The historic neighborhood was still waking up from its winter slumber, with only a handful of early risers scurrying about to start their day. Emily Anne breathed in the crisp air, feeling a sense of renewal wash over her as she gazed out at the quiet streets below.

As an income tax preparer for the small firm of Hatcher & Co., Emily Anne was no stranger to the hustle and bustle of tax season. But despite her expertise and dedication to her clients, she couldn't shake the feeling that this year's returns were going to be particularly challenging. The new tax laws had created a perfect storm of complexities and pitfalls, leaving even the most seasoned preparers like herself scrambling to stay ahead.

Emily Anne made her way down the creaky stairs to the lobby, where her father was already sipping coffee and chatting with their loyal client, Mrs. Jenkins. The Wilson family had owned Hatcher & Co. for generations, and Emily Anne felt a deep sense of responsibility to carry on the tradition. As she joined them in the lobby, Emily Anne couldn't help but wonder what the day would bring â€“ and whether she was up to the challenge.

How does this sound? I've established the setting as a small historic neighborhood with a family-owned tax firm, and introduced the main character, Emily Anne Wilson, as an income tax preparer with a sense of responsibility to her family's legacy.
