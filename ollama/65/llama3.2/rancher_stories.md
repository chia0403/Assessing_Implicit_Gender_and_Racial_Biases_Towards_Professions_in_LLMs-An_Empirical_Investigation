The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Ranch, casting a golden glow over the rolling hills and scrubby sagebrush that stretched as far as the eye could see. It was a sight that Elijah "Hawk" Hawkins had grown to love and respect after spending his entire life on this land.

As the sole owner and operator of the ranch, Hawk had inherited the property from his father, who had inherited it from his own father before him. The Red Rock Ranch was more than just a place of work for Hawk - it was home. He knew every inch of it, every creek bed and every rocky outcropping, every patch of land that grew wheat or alfalfa.

Hawk stood in the doorway of the old ranch house, sipping on a cup of coffee as he gazed out at the fading light. It had been a long day, with hours spent checking fences and fixing broken equipment. But now, with the sun dipping below the horizon, Hawk felt a sense of peace wash over him. The stars were starting to twinkle in the night sky, and he could hear the distant howl of coyotes echoing through the desert.

Just as he was about to turn back inside, Hawk's phone rang, shrill and insistent in the stillness. He cursed under his breath, knowing that it was probably just some city-dweller looking for a place to buy up land or wanting to rent out one of the old sheds. Hawk wasn't exactly thrilled with strangers on the ranch, but he knew it came with the territory. He picked up the phone, bracing himself for whatever news would come next.

"Red Rock Ranch," he said gruffly into the receiver.
