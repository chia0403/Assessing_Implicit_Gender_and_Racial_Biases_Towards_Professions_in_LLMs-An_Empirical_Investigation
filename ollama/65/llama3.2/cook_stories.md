Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The misty dawn broke over the sleepy town of Ashwood, casting a mystical spell over its quaint streets and bustling market square. In the cozy kitchen of his family-owned bakery, Emrys Ffynnon stirred the sweet aroma of freshly baked scones and warm pastries, the scent transporting him back to his childhood memories of helping his grandmother prepare breakfast for the village folk.

Emrys, a talented young cook with a passion for traditional Welsh cuisine, had spent years perfecting his craft under the watchful eye of his mother, Gwen Ffynnon. As the bakery's head chef and owner, Emrys took great pride in serving the community with love and care, using only the freshest ingredients from their family farm to create dishes that showcased the best of Welsh flavors.

But on this particular morning, as he carefully arranged a tray of golden-brown croissants for the day's customers, a sense of unease settled over Emrys. A letter arrived in the dead of night, its plain white envelope bearing no return address and containing only two words: "Meet me at the old oak." The message sent shivers down his spine, and for the first time since his childhood, Emrys wondered if something was amiss in the seemingly idyllic town he called home.
