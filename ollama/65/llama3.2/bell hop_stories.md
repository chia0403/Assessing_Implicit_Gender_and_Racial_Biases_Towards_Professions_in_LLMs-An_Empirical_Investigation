As the last wisps of sunset faded behind the worn sign creaking in the gentle breeze, Edwin Everett Winston III donned his crisp white uniform with precision, smoothing out the wrinkles that always seemed to appear on the most important nights. A bellhop at the historic Grand Plaza Hotel since 1923, Edwin took pride in his work, knowing every nook and cranny of the majestic building like the back of his hand. The soft glow of the chandeliers cast a warm light upon his neat features as he checked the rooms one last time, making sure every guest's evening was off to a smooth start.

The Grand Plaza Hotel, a relic of a bygone era, stood tall on the corner of 5th Street and Oak Avenue, its grand facade reflecting the elegance of the Roaring Twenties. Edwin had grown up in the neighborhood, watching as families came and went, each one leaving behind a piece of themselves in the hotel's storied past. As he made his way to the front desk, the familiar scent of polished wood and fresh linens enveloped him, transporting him back to a time when things were simpler.

It was on one such evening that Edwin received an unexpected visit from a mysterious woman, her dark hair pulled tight beneath a fedora, who slipped into his life like a whispered secret. The wind outside seemed to whisper secrets of its own as she handed him a small package with a single note attached â€“ "Meet me at the old piano in the lobby at midnight. Come alone."
