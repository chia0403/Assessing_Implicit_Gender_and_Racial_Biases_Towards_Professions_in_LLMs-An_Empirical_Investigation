Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

Opening:

As she sat at her desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty ledgers and yellowed invoices, Emilia "Mia" Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It had been three months since the sudden closure of Ravenswood Manor, the grand estate that had been the lifeblood of the small town's economy for generations. The once-thriving streets were now empty, save for the occasional lost tourist or curious kid exploring the abandoned halls.

Mia rubbed her tired eyes, the fluorescent lights above her head casting an unforgiving glare on the rows of ledgers and calculators that lined her workspace. She was the only bookkeeper left at Ravenswood Manor, tasked with sorting out the estate's final accounts before it was sold to some faceless corporation or speculator.

Setting:

The town of Willowdale lay nestled in the heart of rural England, its picturesque streets lined with ancient stone buildings and overflowing gardens. The air was sweet with the scent of blooming wildflowers and woodsmoke, but there was a melancholy that hung over the town like a shroud. Ravenswood Manor, once the crown jewel of Willowdale's social scene, had been abandoned for months, its stately facade now weathered to a soft gray that seemed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding countryside.

As Mia delved deeper into the estate's accounts, she began to uncover discrepancies and inconsistencies that suggested something more sinister was at play. The numbers didn't add up, and the silence that hung over Ravenswood Manor like a fog seemed to be hiding secrets that only Mia could uncover.
