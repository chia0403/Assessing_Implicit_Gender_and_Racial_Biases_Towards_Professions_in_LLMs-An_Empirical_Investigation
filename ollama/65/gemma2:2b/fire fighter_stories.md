The wind whipped at **Cassius "Cash" Davenport's** weathered face as he leaned against the rusted ladder of his old truck, its engine groaning like a dying beast.  Smoke billowed from somewhere in the distance – the usual orange smear on the horizon that always seemed to come with twilight in this industrial wasteland. The sky was an ugly, bruised canvas of purple and grey, mirroring the heavy feeling in Cash's gut. 

He’d been a firefighter for over ten years now, each year bringing him closer to the inevitable - retirement he just knew wasn’t long after. Tonight, however, felt different. A premonition clung to him like smoke from a smoldering wreck – a whisper of danger that echoed in the rustling leaves and the distant caw of an owl. It was a feeling Cash couldn't ignore, not when the city's skyline stretched above him like an accusing giant. 

The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel and burnt plastic, the familiar scent of danger mixed with the metallic tang of despair that clung to this town like cobwebs in a forgotten basement.  He knew there were always more stories to be told here – tales etched onto the grimy walls of abandoned factories and whispered through the cracks in the sidewalk. Tonight's story, however, was about to unfold on a much grander scale.
