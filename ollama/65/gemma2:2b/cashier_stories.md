The fluorescent lights buzzed above Amelia "Amy" Rose's head, casting long shadows on the worn linoleum floor of the corner store. A faint scent of stale coffee clung to the air, mingling with the familiar fragrance of overripe bananas and day-old donuts.  Her nametag read "Amy," in a bold font that clashed against the faded blue of her uniform. She'd been working at "Tom and Jerry's Bargain Basement" for three years, long enough to know the rhythm of this chaotic little corner of town. 

The afternoon was settling into its usual grumpy pattern: the slow creep of the clock, the inevitable stream of customers, and the ever-present threat of a faulty cash register. Today, Amy's usual clientele - Mrs. Henderson with her predictable shopping list, Mr. Jones who always wore a frown and bought cigarettes in packs, and old Mr. Johnson struggling to carry his overflowing bags of groceries - seemed particularly disgruntled. A storm had rolled through the area earlier that morning, leaving the air thick with a sense of unease. 

This time it was more than just the weather; a knot of anxiety tightened in Amy's stomach as she watched a young man standing at the counter, his face obscured by the shadow of his baseball cap. His eyes darted around, landing on Amy's before settling on the register with a palpable air of urgency.
