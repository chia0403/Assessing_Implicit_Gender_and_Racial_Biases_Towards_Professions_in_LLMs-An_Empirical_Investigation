##  The Scent of Salt and Sorrow

Rain hammered against the roof of "Curls & Co." like tiny fists beating on wood. Inside, Amelia Thornton, her brow furrowed beneath an elaborate braid woven from her client's lavender hair extensions, ran a calloused finger through a tangle in Mrs. Henderson's otherwise flawless tresses.  The once vibrant auburn was now dull and lifeless, its lifeblood stolen by years of grief. 

Amelia’s salon, nestled on the edge of Brighton’s bustling pier, usually exhaled a warm fragrance of jasmine and coconut shampoos, a comforting sanctuary for both hair and soul. But tonight, it smelled like the churning sea – salty, unforgiving, with a hint of despair. 

Mrs. Henderson, her eyes reflecting the grey sky through a veil of tears, had confided in Amelia about losing her beloved husband, Harold. It wasn't just the loss; it was the silence that surrounded him now, the hollow spaces left by his laughter and warmth.  Amelia knew how to weave magic with hair, but even she couldn’t mend the threads of someone’s heart when they were unraveling. 


The storm outside mirrored the turmoil inside Amelia. She wasn't a woman of words, her solace found in the art of cutting and styling, blending chaos into harmony one strand at a time. But tonight, as Mrs. Henderson silently awaited the magic of her craft, Amelia couldn’t help but feel a yearning for something more than just hair.
