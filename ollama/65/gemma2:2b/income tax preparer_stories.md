The fluorescent hum of the office lights buzzed like a frantic hornet's nest in Elara Thorne’s ears.  It was a Tuesday in late April, but the air hung thick with the oppressive weight of a thousand-dollar refund checks and endless lines of disgruntled taxpayers who'd somehow managed to accrue more tax liability than sunshine in July. Elara sighed, running a hand through her already dishevelled brown hair. It wasn't just the taxes; it was the smell – that peculiar concoction of sweat, desperation, and stale coffee brewing from a chipped mug she had found years ago amongst a pile of forgotten filing folders.  

Elara Thorne's office, nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, was a testament to decades of tax season survival: walls lined with tax forms like an unruly swarm of locusts, overflowing filing cabinets that whispered secrets to those who dared to peer into their depths, and a creaking vintage desk where she spent her days trying to untangle the financial tangles woven by her clients.  The only escape she found was in her old-fashioned coffee maker, its aroma a welcome balm against the storm brewing behind Elara's steel-grey eyes. 

Her usual quiet hum of concentration was broken by the shrill cry of the phone, its tone echoing like an unwelcome bird's call. "Ms. Thorne," came Mrs. Henderson's strained voice, her words peppered with a fear that usually simmered beneath a thick layer of societal discomfort.  "It's happened again."
