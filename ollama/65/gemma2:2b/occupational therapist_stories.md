The flickering neon sign cast a lurid orange glow across the cracked asphalt of 8th Street. Inside "The Reclaim," the air was thick with a mix of sweat, stale coffee, and the nervous energy of forgotten dreams. Evelyn Thorne, her worn-out Converse echoing against the grimy linoleum floor, surveyed the room, her sharp gaze flitting over the faces clustered around makeshift tables – teenagers picking at their phones, retirees playing dominoes, and a young father, his hand shaking as he tried to fold a laundry basket overflowing with baby clothes. 

Evelyn was no stranger to these kinds of places, to the stories etched onto the tired smiles of her patients. She'd been an occupational therapist for ten years now, witnessing the slow unravelling of lives and the spark of resilience that flickered amidst the wreckage. Here, in this forgotten corner of the city, Evelyn’s job was more than just physical therapy; it was about reconnecting broken spirits with the tools to rebuild their own lives.
