The scent of sandalwood and citrus lingered in the air, thick enough to almost taste.  It clung to everything - the worn leather chairs, the faded tapestry on the wall depicting a battle-scarred king, even the lanky young man standing awkwardly behind the counter. This was no ordinary barber shop; this was "A Trim Above" run by the meticulous Mr. Sebastian Thorne and his late father's spirit.

Sebastian Thorne, or as everyone called him, "Seb," surveyed the chaos of a Tuesday morning with tired eyes.  His fingers tapped on the worn leather of his father's old ledger while he listened to Mrs. Henderson complain about the lack of proper head-bandages for her cat. The shop was bustling â€“ a steady flow of faces seeking their daily trim, each one unique in its own way. 

Today, however, there was an undercurrent of tension that seemed to hang heavier than the usual Tuesday evening rain.  Seb couldn't quite put his finger on it. Maybe it was the man with the hawk-eyed stare and a leather jacket too thick for summer, or maybe it was the hushed whispers in the back room where Mrs. Henderson's daughter was crying about her stolen heirloom necklace. Whatever the cause, Seb found himself itching to escape the confines of "A Trim Above" even as he felt an undeniable pull towards his father's legacy - a legacy that seemed more fragile than ever before.
