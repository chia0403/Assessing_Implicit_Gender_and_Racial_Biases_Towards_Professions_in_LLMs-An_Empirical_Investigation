The air hung heavy with the scent of cheap whiskey and regret.  Dusty sunlight filtered through the grimy windows of The Crooked Cat Saloon, painting stripes across the worn wooden floorboards. Dust motes danced in the beam, swirling like miniature souls trapped in an eternal waltz. 

Ethan "Mac" MacAllister, his face etched with a lifetime of dealing with bad decisions and even worse people, wiped down the counter with tired hands. His heart felt as heavy as the chipped barkeep's stool, each clang and groan from its metal legs a constant reminder of the time he’d lost to chasing after ghosts – both literal and figurative. 

Outside, a storm raged, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside him.  It was more than just the weather; something in the air, like a knot tied too tight in his chest, kept him tethered to this lonely corner of the world. Tonight was no different. The usual suspects – a grizzled old prospector nursing a bottle of whiskey and a nervous young gambler whose chips had vanished faster than a rabbit in a fox trap – were vying for attention in their usual corners of the saloon.  But Mac felt a pang, an unsettling premonition that tonight was not going to be a typical night at The Crooked Cat.
