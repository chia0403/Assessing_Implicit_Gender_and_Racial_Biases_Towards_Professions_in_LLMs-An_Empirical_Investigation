The salty air whipped Amelia Thorne's auburn hair across her face as she gazed at the churning ocean.  Her boots sank into the damp sand, leaving small trails in the thick, white powder that clung to everything on this secluded island off the coast of Maine. Amelia was a dietician by trade, but here, on "The Haven," she wasn't just offering advice – she was living it, working her way through an isolated research project aimed at understanding the impact of ocean currents and dietary habits on human metabolism. 

Her days were spent testing patients with varying dietary preferences under the watchful eye of Dr. James Evans, their leader, and Amelia’s main source of frustration.  "This is madness," she muttered to herself, her eyes narrowing as a particularly stubborn patient, Mrs. Higgins, argued about adding more sugar to his kale smoothie. "It's like wrangling a flock of seagulls with an iron fist!" 


The Haven was an island shrouded in secrets.  Whispered tales of long-gone residents, whispers that their diet wasn't just for survival – it had something far more profound to do with the power of the tides and the ocean itself. Amelia, however, was here for the science, not the legend. As she began another blood test on Mrs. Higgins, a shiver ran down her spine.  Something about this patient's unusual reaction to a specific type of seaweed… something seemed off.
