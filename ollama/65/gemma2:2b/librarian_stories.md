## Opening Lines

The air in the Astor Library was thick with the scent of old paper and leather, a familiar comfort for Evelyn Thorne.  As she meticulously sorted through stacks of first edition novels, the worn spines whispered stories of bygone eras to her fingertips. Her world - tucked away amongst towering bookcases and hushed whispers â€“ was one she cherished. 

She was an anomaly in a city obsessed with the digital, but Evelyn thrived on the analog, finding solace in the quiet hum of turning pages and the weight of well-loved volumes.  The Astor Library was her sanctuary, a place where stories unfolded not on screens, but on parchment and paper.  Today, however, something was amiss. The usual sense of peace felt strained, replaced by an unsettling tension that pulsed beneath the library's silent grandeur.
