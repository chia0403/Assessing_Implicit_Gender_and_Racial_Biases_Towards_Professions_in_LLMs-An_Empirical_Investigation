The sun hung low on the horizon, painting the vast Montana plains in hues of apricot and blood orange as Jebediah "Jeb" Tucker leaned against his weathered Ford truck. The air hung thick with dust and the scent of sagebrush, each element familiar and comforting. He squinted at the barn, watching a silhouette of a lone black cow graze under the last sliver of sun before retreating into the deepening twilight.  

Jeb's life was etched in lines and sweat stains: hard-earned wrinkles around his eyes, a callused hand gripping the worn leather of his reins as he navigated the unpredictable rhythms of cattle ranching. He'd known every inch of these lands since childhood, knew the language of the wind whispering through the sagebrush and the subtle changes in the herd's movements that heralded impending weather shifts. Yet, even with this intimate knowledge, there was a knot of unease twisting in his gut as he watched the horizon – a storm system brewing on the far-off ridge that hadn’t been seen since his grandfather passed away decades ago. 

A restless gust swept across the plains, carrying the scent of rain and an unsettling premonition of change. Jeb shifted uncomfortably, feeling a weight settle in his stomach that had nothing to do with the approaching storm. This wasn't just any ordinary evening; something was different, a prickle at the back of his neck that told him he should be looking over his shoulder, that tonight’s winds held something far more significant than the usual Montana chill.
