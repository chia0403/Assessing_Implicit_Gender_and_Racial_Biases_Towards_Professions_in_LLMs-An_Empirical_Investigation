Rain lashed against the windows of Detective Alistair "Al" Finch's apartment, mimicking the storm brewing inside him.  The stale scent of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air as he stared at the grainy photograph clutched in his hand. It was a picture of Amelia "Amy" Evans, a girl he swore he knew, though memories of her remained frustratingly elusive. She had been a fixture in his life ever since he'd moved to River Falls five years ago, a childhood friend whose vibrant spirit and infectious laugh had marked him for years. But that was before the silence – before Amy vanished without a trace.

River Falls, nestled amidst rolling hills and shadowed woods, felt as timeless as the legend of Amelia’s own disappearance. It was a town where secrets seemed to cling to the wind like fog clinging to a windowpane. The old clock tower chimed its melancholy tune, echoing Al's growing unease.  Tonight, the case, cold for years, felt about to thaw.
