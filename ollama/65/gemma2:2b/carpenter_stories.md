The rhythmic tap of Henry's hammer echoed through the cavernous workshop like a heartbeat. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light that filtered through the grime-coated windowpane, illuminating the intricate patterns etched onto his latest project: a custom mahogany door for the grand manor house on Willow Creek Lane. It was another day in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, where time seemed to stretch and wrinkle like the aging oak trees lining the cobblestone streets.

Henry's workshop, nestled between a dusty antique shop and a bustling bakery, had been his sanctuary for twenty years. Each piece of wood he worked with held stories – tales of whispered dreams and forgotten joys. The scent of cedar and pine filled the air, mingling with the warm aroma of freshly baked pastries wafting from the nearby bakery.

Yet, the quiet hum of normalcy masked a deeper unease in Henry's heart. Tonight, a storm was brewing, not just on the horizon but also within him. A strange sense of foreboding hung heavy as he finished sanding the mahogany door – a feeling that something momentous was about to unfold.
