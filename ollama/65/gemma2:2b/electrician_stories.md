## Story Opening:

**Setting:** The flickering neon sign of "Lucky's Lounge" cast an oily sheen on the rain-slicked asphalt, its blue glow reflecting in the wet, tired eyes of **Jasper Thorne**. He stood under the overhang, the humid air clinging to him like a second skin. Jasper was never one for fancy things - he liked his tools rough, his beer cold, and his life straightforward. Tonight, however, the straightforwardness of his job felt particularly cruel. 

His call came just before sundown: "The power's out at the old mill."  He adjusted the straps on his battered toolbag, its contents groaning with familiar weight - pliers, screwdrivers, a heavy-duty battery pack - all designed to silence the screams of electrical failures and coax them into submission. Tonight, however, the screams were louder than usual. 

Jasper rubbed the sleep from his eyes, the rhythmic patter of rain against the metal roof above him was the only soundtrack he needed.  He pulled out a cigarette lighter, flicked it open, and stared at the thin stream of flame like a beacon in the fading light. As he lit up, he realized the mill's age was etched into every creak of its wooden frame, every rusted bolt on its facade. He knew this place better than his own home, and tonight, that knowledge felt like a cruel twist of fate. 


**Character:** Jasper Thorne. A man of few words, a master of circuits, and a reluctant hero in the fading heartland of America.
