## The Setting

The air hung thick and humid as the last rays of sun painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and fading orange. Sweat clung to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's brow as she surveyed her small gym, "Fit & Fierce." Neon-pink paint peeled from one wall, clashing with the worn wood floorboards beneath her feet. A lone fan struggled against the humid summer night.

## The Opening

The steady rhythm of her voice, clear and strong, filled the otherwise empty room as Amy led her class through a high-intensity routine. "Push through that fatigue, ladies!" she shouted over the thumping music, her smile mirroring the determined glow in each pupil's eyes. 

"Three more minutes, we'll have this heart rate soaring!" she encouraged, her own steps mimicking the swift and precise movements of her students. But even with a seasoned veteran like Amy at the helm, there was a distinct tension in the air tonight. A palpable unease that went beyond the usual pre-workout jitters. It felt like something was different, heavier than usual.

The question lingered on Amy's lips - what exactly had changed? Her usually bustling gym seemed strangely subdued, her students' usually vibrant energy lacking its usual spark. Something wasn't right.
