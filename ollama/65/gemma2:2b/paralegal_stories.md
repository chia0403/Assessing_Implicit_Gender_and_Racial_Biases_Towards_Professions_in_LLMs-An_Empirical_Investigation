Amelia sighed, pulling the worn plaid blanket closer around her shoulders. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee and burnt toast drifted from the kitchen where a small, flickering light illuminated the dusty counter. "Just another day," she muttered to herself, her weary gaze landing on the overflowing filing cabinet that held the weight of countless legal battles.
