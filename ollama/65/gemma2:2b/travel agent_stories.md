## The Itinerary that Never Was

**Setting:**  A cramped but well-lit office in the heart of Prague's Old Town Square. A faint scent of lavender soap hangs in the air alongside the sharp tang of coffee and stale cigarette smoke. 

**Main Character:** Amelia "Amy" Novak, a travel agent whose life has been defined by meticulously crafted itineraries and the occasional heartbreak. 

* **Story opening:**  The worn leather folder lay open on Amy's desk, its contents as messy and chaotic as her own life. Every page was filled with scribbles of itinerary details, handwritten notes about local delicacies and hidden gems, and photos of places that had become more familiar than friends. Each piece was a testament to a dream she never quite managed to reach - a grand adventure, filled with vibrant colors, exotic locales, and thrilling discoveries.

Amy glanced at the cracked photo on the top left corner – a picture of her grandmother, her smiling eyes framed by a bandana, holding up a hand-drawn map of Europe, all marked with destinations from Amy's childhood: "Rome. Paris. Venice." It was a reminder that she wasn’t merely crafting itineraries, but weaving threads of her own family history into the fabric of others' journeys.

Then, a ringing alarm pierced through the silence, breaking the spell.  "This is it," she muttered to herself, running a hand over the faded map. "The trip that never was."
