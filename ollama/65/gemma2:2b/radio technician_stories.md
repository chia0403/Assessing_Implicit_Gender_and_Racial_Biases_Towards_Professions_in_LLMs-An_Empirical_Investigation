## The Signal

**Setting:**  A ramshackle workshop nestled deep within the backstreets of Portland's industrial district. Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, each drop exploding like tiny fireworks on the tin walls. Inside, dust motes danced in the meager light filtering through the grimy windows.

**Character:** Elara Thorne, her face obscured by a tangled mess of auburn hair and grease-stained goggles, was hunched over a tangle of wires and circuit boards. Her fingers, nimble as a spider's, worked tirelessly, coaxing life from the crackling machinery. Elara, known in these back alleys as "Sparky," was the city's last line of defense against the silent invasion – the insidious radio waves that had begun to seep into every corner of society, leaving a trail of unsettling silence and strange glitches.

A low hum reverberated through the workshop, growing louder with each passing moment. Elara frowned, her eyes narrowed as she adjusted a dial on the mainframe. "Damn it," she muttered under her breath, her lips tight with frustration. "The signal's coming in, but it's garbled." She tapped away at a screen of glowing green digits, the rhythm growing frantic. 

The hum morphed into something sharper, an erratic, almost melodic chirp that sent shivers down Elara’s spine.  Her hand hovered above the control panel, her pulse quickening with unease. The silence was broken by a sudden burst of static, followed by a clear voice, distorted and wavering, yet somehow captivating: 

**"Elara...we're coming for you."**
