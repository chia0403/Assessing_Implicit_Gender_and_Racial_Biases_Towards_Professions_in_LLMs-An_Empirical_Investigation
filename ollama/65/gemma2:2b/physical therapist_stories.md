The late afternoon sun dipped behind the towering pines in the San Bernardino National Forest, painting long, distorted shadows across Dr. Evelyn Thornwood's office.  Inside, the scent of pine-scented cleaning products mingled with the musty aroma of old books and the faint tang of sweat lingering from a morning session on a particularly stubborn knee. Evelyn, her name etched in cursive above the door like a beacon of hope for injured limbs, surveyed her work area – an ergonomic haven of massage chairs and specialized therapy equipment. 

Evelyn was no stranger to challenging cases, but today felt different. The patient, a young professional named Liam Miller with a severe tennis elbow, sat hunched over the table, his face contorted in pain.  Evelyn's heart sank as she saw the frustration etching itself onto his features. Her quiet optimism, her carefully curated calm – it was all starting to feel fragile in the face of this seemingly intractable case.   The mountain air held a chill even at the height of summer, and with the setting sun painting the sky in streaks of fiery orange and purple, a sense of foreboding settled upon Evelyn like the first frost of autumn.
