## The Green Whisperer

**Setting:**  A sun-drenched coastal town nestled amongst rolling hills, where salt air hangs thick and the sound of crashing waves mingles with the cries of gulls. 

**Character:** Bartholomew “Bart” Hawthorne, known to everyone as “The Green Whisperer”. He was a man who found solace in nature, his hands calloused from years spent coaxing life from the earth. His small, weathered face bore the marks of sun and wind, etched with lines that told tales of countless storms he'd weathered alongside the ever-changing tides of the bay.  

The old truck rumbled to a halt in front of Mrs. O'Malley’s cottage – her home was nestled at the edge of a sprawling meadow, where wildflowers bloomed vibrantly despite the encroaching concrete and asphalt of the modern world. 

Bart knew this meadow like the back of his hand. He could tell you exactly how much rain it had received last month by the way the wildflowers swayed, or what species of bird nested in its hidden hollow trees with a single rustle of leaves. Today, however, was different. A dissonant note in the usual symphony of life – a sudden absence of the humdrum, almost melancholic melody of bees buzzing amongst the clover. 

"Something's off," Bart murmured to himself, pushing open the door of the cab and taking a deep breath of the salty air. He stepped onto Mrs. O'Malley’s overgrown lawn, his calloused hands already reaching out for familiar earth.  


What could be the source of this discord?
