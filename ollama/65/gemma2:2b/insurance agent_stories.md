The wind whipped around Ezra Bell’s thinning hair as he stood on the rickety dock, staring out at the choppy expanse of the Atlantic.  His salt-crusted glasses reflected the grey sky and the relentless churn of the sea. A thick coat clung to him like a second skin, despite the summer's lingering heat in this forgotten corner of Maine. His office, a small, dusty storefront tucked down a side street, was usually his haven – filled with spreadsheets, insurance brochures, and the faint scent of stale coffee - but today it felt as distant as the horizon itself.  

Ezra was no stranger to loss. It had been woven into the fabric of his family's history, stretching back to the days when ships sailed on treacherous waters and families faced the unknown with courage and resilience. His own story was a tapestry of misfortune intertwined with threads of hope. He wasn't afraid of it; he understood its rhythm, its inevitability. The man in the broken-down boat off Cape Cod, his insurance policy barely enough to keep him afloat, was just another story in a long line. But this one...this one felt heavy, a weight on his shoulders like an old anchor dragging him down.  


**Setting:** A small coastal town in Maine with a history steeped in maritime tradition and weathered charm.
