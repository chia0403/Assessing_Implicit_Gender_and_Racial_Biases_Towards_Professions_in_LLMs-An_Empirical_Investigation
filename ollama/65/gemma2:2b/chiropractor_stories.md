The worn leather of Dr. Amelia Thorne's massage table creaked under the weight of Mr. Henderson’s body as he lay on it. The scent of pine needles and lavender hung in the air, mingled with the faint tang of disinfectant from the small clinic's humble decor.  Outside, a relentless drizzle pattered down, mimicking the slow rhythm of Amelia's fingers as she kneaded Mr. Henderson’s tense shoulders. 

Amelia had always found solace in the rhythmic pulse of human bodies—the symphony of bones and muscles that whispered secrets to those who knew how to listen. Her clinic, nestled on a quiet street corner in Seattle's bustling Ballard district, was her sanctuary, a place where she could weave healing magic with every adjustment. 

But tonight, as Amelia worked, the storm outside seemed to mirror the turmoil swirling within her. Mr. Henderson's back pain, a familiar melody of chronic tension, had become more than just work; it was a reminder of the shadow that lurked in the corners of her life—the ghost of the accident, the one she hadn’t yet dared confront.
