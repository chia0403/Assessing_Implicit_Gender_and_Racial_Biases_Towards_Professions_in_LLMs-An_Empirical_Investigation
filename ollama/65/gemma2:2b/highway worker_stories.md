## Opening

The harsh desert sun beat down on Felix "Lucky" Langston's neck as he meticulously tightened yet another bolt on the new bridge over the Culebra River. Dust swirled around his worn denim overalls and gritty work boots.  It was almost noon, the air thick with the scent of diesel fumes and hot asphalt. The setting sun was turning the sky into a fiery canvas of orange and purple hues, a beautiful but fleeting spectacle he watched from beneath the brim of his cap. 

**Setting:** A dusty stretch of Interstate 10 in the heart of Arizona's Sonoran Desert.  The highway stretched endlessly before him, a ribbon cutting through the vast expanse of sand and scrubland. The surrounding landscape was dominated by towering mesas and rocky outcroppings that clawed at the sky like angry sentinels. Even the wind seemed to whisper tales of forgotten times and harsh survival, carrying with it the dry scent of cacti and the echo of distant thunderstorms.
