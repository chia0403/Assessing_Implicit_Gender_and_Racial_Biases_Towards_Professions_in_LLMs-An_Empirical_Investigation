The rain pounded against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, each drop like a tiny hammer blow on the glass pane. It mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach as she sat across from Mrs. Miller. The air hung thick with unspoken tension and the faint scent of lavender from the room's diffuser. 

"So," said Mrs. Miller, her voice cracking slightly, "my husband... he's justâ€¦ lost it."

Eleanor took a deep breath, feeling the weight of expectation in the silence that followed. She knew this was only the beginning, the first step into the tumultuous labyrinth that Mrs. Miller was navigating: the unraveling of a marriage threatened by an avalanche of unaddressed issues. 

Eleanor adjusted her glasses and leaned forward, a faint smile playing on her lips. "Tell me about it, Mrs. Miller."  The world outside was a storm raging in earnest, but inside this room, amidst flickering lights and comforting scent of lavender, they would find a way to navigate the tempest and build something stronger.
