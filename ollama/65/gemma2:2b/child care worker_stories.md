## Setting:

The sun dripped through the stained glass windows of The Cottage Preschool, casting kaleidoscopic swirls across the faces of the children playing in the brightly-colored room.  A gentle breeze rustled the leaves outside, carrying the faint scent of freshly baked cookies from Mrs. Henderson's kitchen down the chimney. 

## Character:

Amelia "Amy" Nightingale was a whirlwind of organized chaos in a sea of carefully chosen crayons and glitter glue. At twenty years old, her face held a familiar mix of youthful wonder and weary practicality. Her auburn hair, usually tucked behind her ear with a neat headband, was currently pulled back into a messy bun as she attempted to wrangle four giggling toddlers into a line for story time. 

She wasn't just the caretaker at The Cottage; she was the keeper of their dreams, their stories, and their little heartbreaks â€“ all under the watchful eye of Mrs. Henderson, her grandmotherly presence a constant in the ever-shifting landscape of childhood.  


## Story Opening:

"And now," Amy announced, her voice tinged with both excitement and exhaustion, "for the story about the grumpy dragon!" 

The children erupted in a chorus of squeals and giggles, their attention instantly captivated by the tale of a dragon who was convinced his scales were too large, making him too uncomfortable to fly.  Amy, ever-vigilant, kept a close eye on each child, her heart swelling with pride as she witnessed their burgeoning imaginations soar into the world of make-believe. 

However, a silent storm brewed in Amy's own heart. Just yesterday, little Liam had confided in her about his fear of thunderstorms, his small voice trembling as he described the thunderbolts as "angry giants."  A shiver ran down her spine as she remembered Mrs. Henderson's words echoing in her mind: "Sometimes even the most comforting stories cannot hold back the storms we face within." 

As Amy began to read the story, she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. The children's faces, usually painted with innocent delight, held a peculiar seriousness, their eyes searching for answers she wasn't quite prepared to give.
