The wind whipped across Rowan Oak's sprawling lawns, tugging at the collar of his worn flannel shirt.  He squinted through the relentless grayness, the sky mirroring the dull ache in his shoulders after another long day spent battling encroaching weeds and pruning unruly roses. The setting sun, a smudge of orange on the horizon, cast an almost mournful glow upon Rowan Oak's meticulously manicured grounds. 

Rowan was more than just a groundskeeper - he was the heart of the place. He knew every twist and turn of these overgrown acres, from the gnarled oak tree at the edge of the pond to the hidden wildflower patch behind the stables. He wasn’t paid for his work, not in the traditional sense. It was something else entirely – a responsibility passed down through generations, woven into the very fabric of the sprawling estate. 

The old caretaker's cottage creaked with age, its windowpanes like weary eyes watching the world outside. Rowan sat on its worn wooden porch, a mug of steaming cocoa warming his hands, the aroma battling against the damp chill of the coming night.  It was here he’d find solace amidst the whispers of time and the endless cycle of life and death that marked every season.
