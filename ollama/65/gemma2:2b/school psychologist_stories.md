Rain lashed against the windows of Elmwood Elementary School, each drop echoing like a tiny gunshot in the silence inside.  Inside, Dr. Amelia Nightingale, her usually warm smile replaced with a tired furrow, shuffled through a stack of reports and folders.  The air was thick with the usual scent of anxiety - pencil shavings, fear, and something vaguely chemical that she suspected was leftover from the last episode of "Sensory Chaos" in Mrs. Henderson's third-grade classroom. 

Amelia sighed, running a hand through her auburn curls. It wasn't just the rainy day or the lingering chaos. She had a distinct feeling tonight would be an especially difficult one.  This wasn't Elmwood's first rodeo with "the Situation" - and neither was Amelia a newbie to this storm-ravaged town. But tonight, something felt different. The usual unease about her caseload of children struggling with anxieties and social challenges was amplified by the looming storm, casting long shadows across everything, even on Ameliaâ€™s usually stoic face.  She just knew it.
