The air hung thick with damp pine needles and the tang of freshly-cut timber as Elias 'Hawkeye' Caldwell surveyed his domain.  His worn boots crunched on the forest floor, each sound reverberating through the silent woods like whispers from a forgotten age. The sun, struggling to pierce the dense canopy, cast long shadows that danced with the swaying branches. Hawkeye felt them, too - a deep sense of unease prickling at the edges of his awareness.  It was as though the forest itself held its breath, waiting.

Hawkeye, renowned in these parts for his quiet strength and his uncanny ability to read the pulse of the woods, had been logging these pines for thirty years. His family name echoed through generations, each one leaving their mark on the land: from building sturdy cabins to carving out a living from the heart of this ancient forest. But lately, a creeping unease hung heavy like the humidity that clung to his weathered skin.  A strange silence had overtaken the woods â€“ no birdsong, no rustling leaves, just an unsettling stillness.  And tonight, something else was amiss: the air felt charged, almost electric, with an unseen energy.
