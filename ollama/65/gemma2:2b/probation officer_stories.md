Rain lashed against the windows of the Community Center, blurring the city lights outside into watery streaks. Inside, Ms. Eleanor Vance, with her crisp navy suit and an air of unwavering authority, felt like she was wading through a thick fog, both literally and figuratively.

The case that sat before her was something altogether different - Daniel Taylor, a troubled artist whose life had imploded after his mother's death and subsequent eviction from their dilapidated studio apartment. Eleanor watched as the rain battered against the window pane, mirroring the turbulent emotions swirling within the young man himself.
