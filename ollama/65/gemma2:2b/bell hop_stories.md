Rain hammered against the glass facade of The Grand Phoenix Hotel, each drop exploding like a miniature firework show on the polished silver trim.  Inside, the once-sparkling lobby was cloaked in an eerie twilight, the gas lamps casting long shadows across the worn tapestry depicting a mythical phoenix in flight. This was not your usual hotel atmosphere; this was the afterglow of a storm and a lifetime's worth of unspoken tragedies.

This was where Thomas "Tommy" Finch, a bellhop with more tales to tell than years on his weathered face could hold, found solace amongst the clatter of luggage, the scent of old perfume clinging to faded silk sheets, and the echoing sighs of lost dreams.  He'd been here since he was a boy, learning the rhythm of the hotel like a heartbeat in a symphony of sorrow. He knew every corner, every creak, every whisper of the stories hidden within these walls.

Tonight, the air thrummed with an unwelcome tension; a storm brewed not just outside but inside, too. A new Mrs. Hawthorne had checked into room 307, her emerald green eyes glinting like newly-forged jewels. She was as aloof as a frost-covered pond and as captivating as a siren song.  Tommy felt the familiar pull of curiosity mixed with apprehension, his bellhop instincts tingling. This storm wasn't just raining on the rooftops; it was swirling in the very air around her.  He only hoped he wouldn't get caught in its wrath.
