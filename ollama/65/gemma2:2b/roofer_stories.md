## Story Opening 

The midday sun beat down on Thomas "Tommy" Sullivan's weathered face as he climbed the rickety ladder leading to the peak of the old Victorian mansion.  Dust motes danced in the thin shafts of sunlight filtering through the warped shingles, and the air hung heavy with the scent of damp wood and years of accumulated secrets.  His boots echoed on the rotting boards as he shimmied his way up, a symphony of groans and creaks accompanying him like an old man complaining about the weather.

Tommy, 52 years young with hands calloused from decades of hauling timber and hammering nails, ran a hand through his thinning blonde hair before grabbing hold of the top rung.  He was used to heights; it was in his blood, like a carpenter's tool he couldn't quite shake off. But even for him, this felt different, unsettlingly so.  The old house on Willow Creek Lane held more than just years of dust and neglect; its history whispered secrets in the wind whistling through the decaying eaves. Tonight, Tommy wasn't just fixing a roof; he was unraveling a puzzle that seemed to have been waiting for him his whole life.
