The crisp air of the mountain foothills bit at Elara's cheeks as she stepped out onto the porch of her cabin. Snow dusted the pine needles in a delicate layer, making the already serene landscape seem even more idyllic.  Elara, a Physician Assistant who’d dedicated the last five years to serving remote clinics like this one nestled deep in the Colorado wilderness, inhaled deeply. The smell of woodsmoke and pine mingled with the crisp air, grounding her for another day on the edge of the world. 

Today's schedule was particularly daunting.  Word had come down from the main clinic about an elderly woman who’d been experiencing dizziness and persistent nausea – a mystery that needed unravelling. Elara hoped this wouldn't be another endless trail of medical unknowns, another unanswered question in the face of nature's unpredictable whims. 

She was used to working on her own out here, usually with only the occasional help from a visiting nurse or a local herbalist. But something about today felt different, like the air held a weight she couldn’t quite place.  The setting sun cast long shadows through the pines, painting everything in a soft, ethereal glow. It was as if the forest itself wanted to whisper a secret, one that Elara needed to decipher before darkness fell.
