The salty air whipped Amelia’s graying hair across her face as she leaned on the weathered railing overlooking the harbor. The seagulls squawked overhead, their white feathers flashing like freshly fallen snow against the dark storm clouds brewing in the distance.  Amelia adjusted her worn leather apron and sighed. This was it – the hour before opening day at "The Razor's Edge," her small shop nestled beneath the soaring sails of a historic clipper ship turned quaint hair salon. 

She’d inherited The Razor’s Edge from her grandmother, who swore the building possessed an “aura of good luck” - and Amelia had certainly seen some of it during the years she spent tending to customers' unruly locks. But today was different. A new storm brewed not just in the sky, but within Amelia herself.  She was about to take on a challenge far greater than any braid or buzz cut: helping her first-ever client navigate the treacherous waters of love and loss. 


The setting is: **A quaint, seaside town** named **Saltwind Cove** with a strong maritime history, now home to a variety of shops like Amelia’s "The Razor's Edge," a salon where time seems to slow down and the waves hold secrets whispered only to those brave enough to listen.  
 
Character:  **Amelia "May" Sinclair**, a woman with a sharp mind and even sharper shears, who has spent her life navigating the complex currents of love and loss within Saltwind Cove's tight-knit community.
