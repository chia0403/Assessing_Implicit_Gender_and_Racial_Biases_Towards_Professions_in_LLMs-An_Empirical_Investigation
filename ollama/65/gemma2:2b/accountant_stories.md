Rain lashed against the windows of Arthur Sterling’s office like angry cats clawing at glass. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and something faintly metallic – an echo of last night's cocktail party. It was a Friday, but the clock on his desk felt heavier than usual, each tick a slow-burning ember in the growing fire of unease that had taken root within him.  

Arthur, a man meticulously groomed with a neat goatee and eyes that darted between ledger sheets and swirling storm clouds outside, was no stranger to stress. He was an accountant by trade, his life a symphony of balance sheets and profit margins. But tonight, even the precision of his calculations couldn't soothe the growing disquiet in Arthur’s gut. The weight of this particular month-end audit felt heavier than usual, more like an ominous storm gathering on the horizon.  

The air hung heavy with unspoken worries as he finished a particularly lengthy report, tapping away at his computer keyboard until a sharp knock echoed through the silent room. A young intern stood framed in the doorway, her cheeks flushed and eyes wide with concern. “Mr. Sterling,” she stammered, “Mrs. Davenport’s called again.” 

Arthur didn't need to be told what this meant. The whispers of "unexpected irregularities" had been swirling around his office for weeks now, but Mrs. Davenport's calls were a constant reminder that even in the world of numbers and calculations, there are often hidden edges that threaten to expose the truth.
