## The Setting: A faded grandeur

**Opening:** 

The air hung thick with the scent of hairspray and stale dreams, a familiar tapestry woven across the years in the once-grand "Velvet Salon."  Years ago, it had been a symbol of sophistication, its plush chairs nestled amongst shimmering gold frames that held portraits of women who had graced the city with their presence. Now, the mirrors were dulled, the gold faded to a sickly hue of brass, and the only whispers came from the creaks of the floorboards and the rustle of discarded magazines in the corner.  The main window looked out onto an alleyway now choked with weeds and trash bins overflowing with forgotten dreams. 

**Character:** Esmeralda "Esme" Fontaine

Esmeralda was not like the women who once graced these walls. She was a woman who carried her own weight on her shoulders, her life a tapestry woven from the threads of hardship and resilience.  The years had etched lines around her hazel eyes, each one holding a story untold. But even with the weight of her past hanging heavy, Esme's hands remained deft and sure, capable of transforming a woman's face with the stroke of a brush or the swirl of a curling iron. Today was no different: she was preparing for another day in this fading haven, ready to face the world outside.

* **Esme's resilience and hidden strength:**  How does she cope with hardship? 
* **The power of transformation:** How does Esme use her craft to empower women in a world that often tries to dim their light?
