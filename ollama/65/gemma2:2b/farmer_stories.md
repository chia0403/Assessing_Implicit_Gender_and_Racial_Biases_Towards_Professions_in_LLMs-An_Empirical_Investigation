The morning mist hung low over Meadowbrook Farm like a damp shroud, clinging to the barley stalks and shrouding Farmer Elara Blackwood's gnarled hands in its chill embrace.  Elara, with her weather-beaten face and eyes that held the wisdom of a hundred storms, squinted at the rising sun through the gaps in the barn doors. She could almost taste the sweet tang of dew on her tongue as she began the day’s chores, the familiar rhythm of the farm humming around her like a tired but reliable engine. 

The land was their lifeblood: fertile soil stretching out as far as the eye could see, its heart beating with the ancient rhythms of the seasons. But this year felt different. A stillness clung to Meadowbrook, an unsettling quiet that wasn't quite at odds with Elara's own unease. The silence in the barn after she’d finished her morning chores was deeper than usual, and a strange sense of anticipation hovered over her like an unseen storm cloud.  Elara could feel something was coming, a change as subtle as the shift in wind direction but as undeniable as a sunrise after a long night.
