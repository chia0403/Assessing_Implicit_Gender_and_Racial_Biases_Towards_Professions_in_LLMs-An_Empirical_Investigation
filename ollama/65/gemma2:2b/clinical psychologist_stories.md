The rain lashed against the windows, each drop drumming a frantic tattoo on the glass like a nervous heartbeat. Inside the cozy office, Dr. Amelia Rosehart huddled over her latest case file, a mountain of yellowing paper she couldn't seem to climb. A single streetlamp flickered outside, bathing her small town in an uncertain glow – just as her own life felt. 

Amelia had always been drawn to people's darkest corners, those hidden anxieties and fears that festered just below the surface. As a clinical psychologist in Oakhaven, she’d spent years listening to the unspoken, helping others navigate their internal maelstrom.  But lately, even Amelia's practiced empathy felt strained, as if the weight of her own personal demons was pulling her down into the very murky depths she so often helped others escape. 

The case file throbbed with a palpable tension. Mrs. Evans, an elderly widow who’d been a pillar of Oakhaven for decades, had suddenly gone quiet. No longer offering her comforting smiles or volunteering at the local community center. Instead, the silence was deafening, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the old clock on the mantelpiece.
