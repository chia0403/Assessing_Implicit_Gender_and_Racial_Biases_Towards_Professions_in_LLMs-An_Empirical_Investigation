The wind whipped across Dale "Ironhand" Tucker's weathered face as he gripped the steering wheel tighter.  He squinted through the haze of dust that perpetually coated the highway, his eyes focused on the endless stretch of asphalt stretching out before him.  His rig, christened "Betsy," was a steel behemoth, its chrome gleaming like an old-fashioned beacon in the desolate heartland.  For years, Betsy had carried Dale across the country, her engine thrumming a lullaby through his veins as he navigated countless miles of empty highways and desolate truck stops.

The small roadside diner that served as his temporary home was nestled amongst towering cottonwood trees, their branches casting long, shadowy fingers across the dusty ground.  A faded neon sign flickered above the doorway, its red glow painting a faint smile on Dale's face as he stepped inside. The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and fried grease, punctuated by the occasional clinking sound of plates or the murmur of voices. 

The waitress, a woman whose nameplate read "Betty" in her trademark faded blue apron, met his gaze with a tired smile.  She slid a steaming mug across the counter, then gestured to a creaky booth near the window. It was the kind of place where time seemed to slip on its own worn-down seams, and where every story told held the weight of countless miles on it.
