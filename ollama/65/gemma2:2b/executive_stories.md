Her tailored suit felt suffocating, like an iron cage around the fire that burned in her chest. She glanced out the skyscraper window, its glittering skyline mirroring the chaos swirling inside her. 

It was supposed to be a routine meeting, a final push for approval on a merger deal with Apex Corp., a behemoth of the tech industry known for ruthless efficiency and questionable practices. But Amelia Vance, CEO of Veridian Industries, was not just negotiating; she was battling.  For years, their relationship had been one of calculated respect, of carefully crafted compromises.
