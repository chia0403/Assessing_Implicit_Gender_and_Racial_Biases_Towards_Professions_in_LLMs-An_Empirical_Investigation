**Character:**  Evelyn "Evie" Hayes, her name emblazoned across the top of her bright blue uniform like a badge of honor amidst the chaos.

She navigated the bustling city streets with a practiced ease, the rhythm of her steps barely a sound over the constant din of life. 

**Opening Lines:**
"Another Friday night," she muttered to herself, flipping on the flashing blue lights of the ambulance as it sped down the narrow, shadowy alleyway. "And another reason why I should have gone for that beach vacation." A young man slumped against the fire escape, his head lolling back, a crimson stain blossoming across his white shirt.  His face was contorted in pain, and Evie knew there was nothing more terrifying than witnessing the slow decay of life. 

"Mr. Jackson," she sighed, kneeling down beside him. "We're going to help you."  She met his glassy eyes with her own steel-grey gaze, a silent promise forming between them, one of shared hope in the face of despair.
