Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop exploding into a miniature rainbow on the grimy glass. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Davenport huddled in her faded armchair, a plume of steam from the old thermos of chamomile tea swirling around her face like a ghostly halo. The worn, leather-bound photo album in her lap was open to a page featuring a picture of her grandfather's ramshackle farm, the one that had been sold off years ago for the "progress" of town. 

This was not progress for Amy. It felt more like the erasure of life itself. She had spent the last six months trying to convince her father that she needed access to the property, but his response remained a flat "No."  He'd always been protective, wary of anything that reminded him of the years they'd lost - the years he'd dedicated to cleaning and repairing the farm after an unmitigated disaster. The one thing he refused to give up on was his "little piece of paradise," as he called it. This paradise felt a million miles away now, choked by concrete and steel, swallowed whole by the relentless tide of the city. 

But Amy saw it differently.  The old photos were her lifeline, each image a window into her forgotten past. She wasn't just looking at faded faces; she was feeling the echo of their laughter, their hardship, the stories they had woven into the very soil of that place. A storm raged on outside, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. 


**Setting:**  A crumbling old farmhouse attic in a small town, now abandoned and overtaken by rain. The year is 2045. Technology has advanced to an extent where most activities can be automated; but for Amy, the old world holds a certain charm that she finds fascinating.

**Character:**  Amy Davenport, a young photographer who feels drawn to capturing the stories left behind in her family's past. Her ambition is fueled by a desire to preserve these memories and understand her own identity within them.
