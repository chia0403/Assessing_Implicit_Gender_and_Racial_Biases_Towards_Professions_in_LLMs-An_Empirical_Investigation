Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Mr. Quentin Hawthorne's pharmacy, each drop a tiny explosion in the symphony of the storm. The air within the shop hung thick with the scent of antiseptic, lavender sachets, and an underlying melancholy that only a half-forgotten spring could dispel. 

Quentin Hawthorne was a man of predictable routines - his life as orderly as the jars lined upon the shelves. He had been a pharmacist for twenty years, tending to the ailments both physical and metaphorical of the townsfolk within the quaint coastal village of Seahaven. The storm outside mirrored the unrest brewing inside him; a restless unease that churned beneath his carefully composed facade.  He hadn't seen anyone other than his family since his wife’s death six months ago, their quiet existence now echoing with an emptiness that gnawed at Quentin like a starving dog. 

His phone vibrated on the counter next to the bottle of cough syrup he was about to dispense, the screen illuminating its cheerful face: **“You got a new delivery?”** From Mrs. O’Connell, the owner of the seaside bakery and his only remaining source of warmth in this tempestuous life.  He sighed, picking up the phone and pressing it to his ear.
