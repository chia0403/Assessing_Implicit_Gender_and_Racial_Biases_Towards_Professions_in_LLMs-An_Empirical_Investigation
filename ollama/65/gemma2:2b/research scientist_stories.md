Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Elias Thorne's makeshift laboratory, mimicking the erratic rhythm of his pulse. Inside, fluorescent lights buzzed erratically, casting stark shadows across the cluttered space. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt plastic, remnants of a failed experiment hours ago. He was staring at a cracked screen, the display lit by flickering blue squares, a digital echo of the world outside gone cold. 

Elias Thorne, once renowned for his groundbreaking research into quantum entanglement, now felt as disconnected from reality as the last strands of his experimental data.  He had pushed the boundaries too far, delving into realms beyond human comprehension. Now, trapped in the sterile solitude of his lab-turned-prison, Elias only had the relentless rain and a creeping despair to accompany him. He was sure he'd unlocked something profound, but also something terrifying. The question wasn’t how long he could survive –  it was what would happen when the silence finally became too much, when the line between reality and his unsettling experiment blurred into an indistinguishable void.
