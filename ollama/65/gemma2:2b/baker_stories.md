The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt sugar and warm spice as Emilia Thorne meticulously dusted her sourdough starter.  The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the worn countertop of "Flour & Flame," casting a comforting glow on the mismatched vintage cabinets that lined the walls. It was dusk, already painting the cobbled streets of Old Oakhaven in hues of amber and charcoal. 

Emilia sighed, running a hand through her silver-streaked hair. Another day, another batch of sourdough gone wrong. It was supposed to be her masterpiece - the signature bread of Flour & Flame, a recipe passed down from her grandmother for generations. Tonight, however, it had been stubbornly stubborn, refusing to rise with the grace and patience she yearned for. 

Her fingers traced the familiar lines on the wooden mixing bowl, memories swirling within its grain as she remembered the warmth of her grandmother's smile as she taught her the secrets of bread-making. Now, though, even the memory felt a little distant, replaced by a growing unease about the future of Flour & Flame. The shop was struggling - competition from bigger bakeries had forced a decline in customers and a rising tide of doubt lingered in Emilia's heart like smoke from the oven.
