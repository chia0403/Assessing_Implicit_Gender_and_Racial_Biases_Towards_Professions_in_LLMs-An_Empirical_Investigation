The air hung thick with the scent of caramelizing onions and simmering stock in "Chez Antoine," a tiny French bistro tucked away on a cobbled side street in Montmartre, Paris. 

Antoine Dubois, his flour-dusted apron cinched tight around his ample belly, hummed along to Edith Piaf crackling from the vintage radio nestled behind the counter. He meticulously chopped chives, each snip precise and purposeful, as he waited for the familiar clatter of the first diner's footsteps announcing the start of their evening service. Antoine loved this time – the anticipation before the rush, the quiet symphony of his knife against the cutting board, the promise of stories whispered over steaming mugs of café au lait and plates piled high with his grandmother's secret recipe boeuf bourguignon.  

The bistro was his sanctuary, a haven built on generations of culinary tradition, his family’s legacy. But tonight, the air held a different kind of tension, a silent tremor that Antoine couldn't quite place. He glanced at the clock – 7:00 p.m., precisely when their most loyal patron, Madame Dupont, would arrive for her nightly plate of onion soup. Where was she?
