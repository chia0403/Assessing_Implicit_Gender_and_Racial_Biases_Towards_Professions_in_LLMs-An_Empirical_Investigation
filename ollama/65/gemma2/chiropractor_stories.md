The air hung thick with the scent of eucalyptus and lavender in Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Montgomery's office. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, painting dust motes dancing in the air gold. Outside, the city hummed with its usual morning symphony: honking taxis, distant construction clanging, and the steady rhythm of feet on pavement. But inside, a peaceful stillness reigned, broken only by Ellie's soft humming as she adjusted a patient's shoulder.

Ellie loved her practice. It wasn't just about fixing spines; it was about mending lives, easing pain, and restoring balance. Each click of a joint felt like a tiny victory, a small step towards someone regaining control over their body and, consequently, their life. 


But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced at the edge of Ellie's awareness.  Maybe it was the way the phone seemed to ring less often than usual, or perhaps it was the unsettling silence from her normally chatty receptionist, Sarah. Whatever it was, a knot of worry began to tighten in Ellie's chest. This wasn't just another day in the busy life of a chiropractor; something felt off, and she couldn't quite put her finger on what.
