The insistent buzzing of her phone dragged Eleanor Finch from the hazy world of dreams where she was scaling teeth on a dragon. She groaned, swatting at the offending device until it mercifully fell silent. 

Eleanor squinted at the clock: 6:02 am. Her usual wake-up time, which felt like a cruel joke considering her sleep had been punctuated by the cacophony of snoring patients and phantom flossers. It was Monday morning, and the familiar aroma of burnt coffee from downstairs already hinted at the long day ahead at Finch & Sons Dental, nestled on Elm Street in their sleepy suburban town of Oakhaven. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing back the unruly auburn curls that threatened to engulf her face. The practice had been her family's legacy for decades, and while she loved caring for the community, sometimes the weight of tradition felt heavier than a molar with advanced decay. Today, however, promised a particularly interesting challenge: Mrs. Peabody, Oakhaven's notoriously grumpy mayor, was scheduled for her bi-annual cleaning, and Eleanor knew that navigating Mrs. Peabody's sharp tongue and even sharper dental hygiene standards would require all the skill she possessed.
