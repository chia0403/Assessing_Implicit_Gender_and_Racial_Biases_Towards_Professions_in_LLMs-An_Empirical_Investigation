The air in the showroom hung thick with the scent of polished mahogany and desperation.  Rain lashed against the large windows, blurring the vibrant facade of “Fine Furnishings & Beyond,” a once-proud establishment now teetering on the precipice of bankruptcy. Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne adjusted her bright red lipstick, her usual cheery demeanor replaced by a strained smile as she surveyed the sparse customer traffic. 

Amelia, a veteran salesperson with a heart of gold and a tongue sharper than a tack, had always relished the challenge of closing deals. But lately, even her most persuasive spiel seemed to fall flat against the backdrop of economic uncertainty and dwindling consumer confidence.  Today, however, was different. Today, a glimmer of hope arrived in the form of a tall, impeccably dressed man who walked through the door, shaking raindrops from his trench coat. His piercing blue eyes scanned the room, lingering on a particularly ornate antique writing desk that Amelia had been trying to sell for months. 


He approached her with a knowing smile, and Amelia felt a spark of anticipation ignite within her.  This could be her big break.
