The klaxon shrieked, shattering the sterile calm of the ambulance bay.  Elara "Ellie" Vance, her heart already pounding from a double shot of espresso, leaped to her feet. Her EMT badge, clipped securely to her uniform, felt heavy against her chest. She grabbed the emergency kit, its contents rattling reassuringly, and sprinted toward the wailing siren. 

The setting sun bled crimson across the cityscape, casting long shadows that danced with flickering streetlights.  New Alexandria, a sprawling metropolis built upon the ruins of an ancient civilization, was a city of stark contrasts: glittering skyscrapers jostled for space with crumbling historical districts, and technology pulsed alongside the echoes of forgotten magic. 

Tonight, Ellie’s destination: The Clockwork District, a labyrinthine network of towering metal structures humming with arcane energy. This wasn't your typical accident call; someone had triggered an unstable temporal anomaly, creating a pocket dimension within the Clock Tower -  a notorious hotspot for eccentric inventors and rebellious sorcerers. 


Ellie tightened her grip on the kit.  She knew this wouldn't be just another night shift. Something was different about the air tonight, charged with an energy that prickled at the back of her neck. It was a feeling she couldn't ignore. The city held its breath, waiting for whatever unfolded in the Clock Tower’s shadow.
