The sun, already a searing eye in the sky, beat down on Demetrius "Demet" Caldwell's neck as he adjusted his mirrored aviator sunglasses. He tugged at the collar of his orange vest, feeling beads of sweat trickle down his temple. The air hung thick and heavy over Highway 97, vibrating with the drone of passing semis and the distant rumble of thunder that promised a fierce afternoon storm. Demet squinted across the endless ribbon of asphalt, stretching out like a shimmering serpent into the hazy distance.  

His calloused hands gripped the worn handle of his road rake, ready to sift through another day's debris: shattered glass, twisted metal scraps, and the occasional unfortunate plastic bottle that had succumbed to centrifugal force and launched itself from a passing car. It was monotonous work, but Demet found a strange solace in it. The rhythm of the rake against the pavement, the steady hum of traffic, and the ever-changing landscape outside his small patch of responsibility - it all formed a comforting routine in a world that felt increasingly chaotic. 


Demet's gaze drifted towards the towering billboard looming on the horizon, its message screaming about a "Better Life" for those who moved to the idyllic suburbs just beyond the highway. He chuckled wryly. A better life, indeed. For some. Demet knew there was more to life than paved roads and manicured lawns. He wasn't looking for anything grand; he just wanted peace, quiet, and a steady hand on the wheel of his own destiny.  But sometimes, out here on Highway 97, it felt like everything was pulling him in different directions.
