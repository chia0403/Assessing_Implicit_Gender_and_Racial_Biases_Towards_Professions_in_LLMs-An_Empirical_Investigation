The stale air in Harold Percival Featherstone's workshop hung heavy with the scent of ozone and solder. A thin layer of dust coated everything, from the antique brass components he meticulously cleaned to the cobwebs clinging precariously to the rafters. Sunbeams slanted through grimy windows, illuminating swirling motes of dust and painting long, dancing shadows across his workbench. 

Harold, a man built more like a sturdy oak than a human being, hunched over a vintage Zenith radio. His gnarled fingers, stained with years of grease and grime, expertly twisted wires, his brow furrowed in concentration. A faint crackle escaped the speaker as he adjusted a potentiometer, followed by a burst of static that sent a shiver down Harold's spine. He was on the verge of something, he could feel it. 

Harold Percival Featherstone wasn't just any radio technician; he was a listener. Not to music or news broadcasts, but to the whispers on the edge of perception, the murmurs from beyond the veil of reality that only his specially modified radios could pick up. And tonight, those whispers were louder than ever before.
