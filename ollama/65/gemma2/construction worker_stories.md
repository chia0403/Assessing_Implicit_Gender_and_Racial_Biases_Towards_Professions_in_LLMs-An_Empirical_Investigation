The sun beat down on Silas Bartholomew's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his already sweat-soaked t-shirt into a second skin.  He squinted at the blueprint taped to the scaffolding, the lines blurring in the heat haze rising from the concrete below. The skeletal frame of what was supposed to be the city’s newest skyscraper loomed over him, a monument to progress and ambition that felt more like a monstrous spiderweb in this suffocating August afternoon. 

Silas, his biceps straining as he hoisted another steel beam into place, let out a grunt that disappeared into the cacophony of clanging metal and shouted orders. This wasn't just another day on the job for him; it was his chance to prove himself.  After years of slinging bricks and hauling lumber, he finally landed a spot on this prestigious project, a stepping stone towards his dream of becoming a foreman. The only problem? His boss, Mr. Hemmings, was a notoriously hard-nosed man with an eagle eye for mistakes. And Silas had a bad feeling that something wasn't right about the blueprint today… 


**Setting:** A sweltering construction site in a rapidly developing city, late August afternoon.
