The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Saloon" cast an unsettling glow on Detective Elias Thorne's weary face. Rain hammered against his trench coat, each drop echoing in the cavernous silence of this deserted backstreet. The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and regret, a scent as familiar to Thorne as his own worn leather gloves.  It was the kind of night that made him question why he'd ever chosen this life, but tonight, even the biting wind couldn't pierce the gnawing worry that had settled deep in his gut. 


Elias Thorne, a man with eyes that held too much wisdom for his thirty-five years, stepped cautiously into the saloon. The sawdust floor was sticky beneath his boots, and the only light came from a flickering lamp above the bar, casting long, grotesque shadows on the empty booths.  He'd heard whispers of this place – a haven for lost souls and shady characters – but tonight, it felt different, eerily silent. 


Something wasn't right. And Thorne knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, that he was about to walk into a storm.
