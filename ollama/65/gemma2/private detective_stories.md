The rain hammered against Detective Elias Thorn's office window like skeletal fingers drumming on a coffin lid. Each drop seemed to echo the dull ache in his gut, a familiar companion these days. His office, tucked away above a greasy spoon diner in the shadowy heart of New Orleansâ€™ French Quarter, was as perpetually dim and cluttered as he felt. A half-eaten beignet sat on his desk, cold and stale, mirroring the lifeless lead he'd been chasing for weeks. 

Elias Thorn, a man who wore his years like frayed tweed and regrets like chipped whiskey glasses, sighed. The only thing brighter than the incessant drizzle outside was the neon sign of "Lola's Lounge" across the street, its lurid pink glow casting a sickly sheen on the rain-slicked cobblestones. It beckoned him like a siren, promising warmth, forgetfulness, and perhaps, just perhaps, a glimmer of something resembling hope in this city that seemed determined to swallow him whole.
