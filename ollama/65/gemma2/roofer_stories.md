The Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Santiago's neck like a blacksmith’s hammer. Sweat dripped into his eyes, blurring the dusty cityscape sprawling beneath him. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a streak across his already grimy face. Eli squinted at the rooftop he was currently scaling, a monstrous structure that felt like a steel labyrinth against the cloudless sky. 

He worked for Garcia Roofing, a small, family-run business struggling to survive in the ever-expanding Phoenix concrete jungle. Today’s job: patching up a leaky roof on a luxury high-rise, owned by some out-of-state tycoon who probably didn't even know where his money went. Eli knew this wouldn’t be easy. The wind howled like a banshee through the building’s skeletal frame, and each step was a gamble against gravity and rusty metal grating. But he needed the paycheck.  He had bills to pay, dreams to chase, and a worn-out Honda that coughed more than it purred.  


Eli took a deep breath, steeling himself for the climb. The heat shimmered in the air, distorting the world around him, but one thing remained clear: he was on his own out here, high above the ground and everything he knew.
