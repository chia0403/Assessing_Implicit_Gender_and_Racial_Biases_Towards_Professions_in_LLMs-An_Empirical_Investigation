The air hung thick with the scent of garlic, rosemary, and simmering tomato sauce. A thin layer of grease coated every surface in “Salvatore's”,  from the cracked vinyl booths to the worn linoleum floor. The rhythmic clanging of pots and pans from the kitchen battled with the incessant chatter of patrons, creating a symphony of noise that was both comforting and chaotic. 

Emilia "Em" Russo navigated this cacophony with practiced ease, her smile as bright and warm as the red checkered tablecloths adorning each table.  She expertly balanced three plates piled high with steaming lasagna, a pitcher of iced tea, and a basket overflowing with crusty bread, all while dodging elbows and stray conversations.  

The diner was bustling on this Friday night – a mix of locals seeking their weekly dose of family-style Italian comfort food and tourists hoping for an authentic taste of "the good ol' days". Em knew each customer by name, their usual orders memorized, and their preferred table ready upon arrival.  She wasn't just serving food; she was serving memories, a piece of home, a slice of normalcy in the ever-changing world outside Salvatore’s doors.
