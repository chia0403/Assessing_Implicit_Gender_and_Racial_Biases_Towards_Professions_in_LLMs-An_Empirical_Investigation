The rusted iron gates groaned as Elara Valinor swung them open, letting in the sickly yellow light filtering through the perpetual haze that hung over the city of Ashfall. The air, thick with the scent of sulfur and decay, scratched at her throat. It had been like this for generations – a consequence of the Great Cataclysm, they called it, though Elara knew no other reality.

Ashfall was a fortress city built on the ashes of a once-great civilization. Crumbling towers of obsidian stretched towards a sky perpetually obscured by ash clouds, and skeletal buildings clawed at each other like desperate beggars. Life here existed in a perpetual state of vigilance. Outsiders were feared, whispers of raiders and scavengers haunting every shadowed corner. 

Elara, a seasoned guard with eyes the color of storm clouds and a braid as dark as the obsidian around them, took her position at the gate. Her gaze swept over the ragged crowd attempting to enter – mothers clutching their children, weary farmers bearing meager provisions, even a lone figure shrouded in a hooded cloak, his face hidden in shadow. Every soul that passed through these gates had a story, a reason for seeking refuge within Ashfall’s grim embrace. And it was Elara’s duty to ensure they were not carrying any secrets that could threaten the fragile peace they held.
