The rusty CB crackled to life in Dale "Diamondback" Jackson's rig, spitting out static before a gruff voice cut through. "Breaker one-nine, any truckers out there hearin' this? This here's Whiskey Jack on channel 19, lookin' for information on a good place to snag some grub in West Virginia."

Dale chuckled, drumming his fingers on the worn leather steering wheel. He was hauling a load of steel from Pittsburgh to Atlanta, his rig nicknamed "The Iron Queen," a hulking Kenworth T800 as solid and dependable as Dale himself. He glanced at the dusty dashboard clock - 4:17 AM.  He'd been on the road for nearly twelve hours, the blacktop ribbon unfurling before him like a slumbering serpent under the pale pre-dawn light. West Virginia was a good chunk of his journey away, but he figured Whiskey Jack could use a helping hand.

"Whiskey Jack, this is Diamondback," Dale answered, his voice a gravelly baritone, "Headed that way myself. Just passed the Ohio line, about three hours from Charleston. There's a diner just off exit 45 called 'Mama Ruby's'. Good home cookin', decent coffee." He took a swig of lukewarm coffee himself, his eyes scanning the endless horizon for any sign of the approaching dawn.


The setting is a lonely stretch of highway in West Virginia during the pre-dawn hours. The air is thick with anticipation and the promise of a new day, but the landscape remains shrouded in darkness, punctuated only by the occasional flickering streetlight and the distant glow of truck stops.
