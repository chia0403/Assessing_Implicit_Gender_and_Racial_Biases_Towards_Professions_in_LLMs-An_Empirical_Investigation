The neon glow of the "Open Mic Night" sign pulsed like a frantic heartbeat against the damp brick wall of The Rusty Bucket. Inside, the air was thick with cigarette smoke and anticipation, a potent cocktail that always got Eleanor Willowbrook's nerves buzzing. 

She clutched her guitar case tighter, its worn leather a familiar comfort against her clammy palms.  The stage, dimly lit by a single bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling, seemed miles away, shrouded in shadow and populated by silent ghosts of hopeful dreams past. Eleanor took a deep breath, inhaling the mingled aromas of stale beer and desperation, and reminded herself why she was here. It wasn't about fame or fortune. It was about her voice, raw and untamed, pouring out the stories etched into her soul, finding solace in the shared vulnerability of strangers united by music. 

Tonight, Eleanor Willowbrook would sing. 


**Setting:** The Rusty Bucket, a dimly lit, run-down bar on the outskirts of Chicago known for its open mic nights and eclectic clientele.
