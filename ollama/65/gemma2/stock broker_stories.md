The air in Reginald Bartholomew Tremont III's office was thick with the scent of old money and stale ambition. Sunlight, filtered through a haze of city smog, glinted off the brass eagle perched atop his mahogany desk. Outside, Wall Street roared like a caged beast, its cacophony filtering through the double-paned windows. Reginald, or Reggie as he insisted everyone call him, tapped his manicured nails against his phone – an antique flip phone, a statement of defiance in a sea of sleek touchscreens. He was waiting for a call, one that could either solidify his position at the top of the financial food chain or send him tumbling into obscurity. 


His gaze swept over the cluttered desk: half-eaten sushi, crumpled stock reports, and an antique silver cigarette case – a relic from a more decadent era.  He craved a cigarette, but he'd sworn off tobacco weeks ago. The doctor had given him that lecture about cholesterol and blood pressure, again. 

Reggie pushed the sentiment aside. Today was not about his health; today was about survival. Today, the fate of Tremont & Sons rested on his shoulders, hanging by a thread thinner than the margin he'd been trying to secure for the last month. The phone buzzed, shattering the tense silence. This call could change everything.
