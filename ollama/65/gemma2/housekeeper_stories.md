The air in the grand old Victorian mansion hung heavy with the scent of beeswax polish and unlived-in dreams.  Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced through the lace curtains, illuminating Amelia Thistlewood's nimble fingers as they dusted a delicate porcelain figurine perched on a mantelpiece tall enough to dwarf her five foot two frame. 

Amelia sighed, pushing back a stray auburn curl that had escaped its braid. Another day, another layer of history being meticulously polished away.  She wasn't sure who had lived in this house before the current occupants, a reclusive artist named Alistair Crane and his taciturn brother, Jasper, but she could imagine their ghosts lingering amongst the faded tapestries and antique furniture. 

The mansion was a labyrinth of echoing corridors and forgotten rooms, each one whispering secrets Amelia longed to uncover. Yet, her duties kept her firmly rooted in the present, forever cleaning, organizing, and tidying up the lives of these enigmatic men she barely knew.  But today, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, an unexplainable prickle on the back of her neck. It was as if the house itself held its breath, waiting for something to happen.
