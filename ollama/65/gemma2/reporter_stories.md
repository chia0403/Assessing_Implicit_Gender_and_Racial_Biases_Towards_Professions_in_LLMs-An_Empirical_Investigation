The neon signs of the Piggly Wiggly on South 7th Street buzzed like agitated wasps, casting lurid stripes across Eliza Beatrice Hawthorne's trench coat as she stepped out of the diner. A greasy napkin clutched in one hand, Eliza took a deep drag from her cigarette, letting the smoke curl around her freckled nose and mingle with the humid Georgia air. She squinted at the faded green awning across the street, its peeling paint advertising "Fresh Produce - Daily." It was the only sign of normalcy in a town that felt increasingly surreal. 


Eliza wasn't sure what was more unsettling: the string of bizarre accidents plaguing Oakhaven lately or the fact that everyone seemed blissfully oblivious to them. Her editor at The Daily Chronicle, a man with the patience of a sand flea and the cynicism of a long-retired detective, had called it "local color." Eliza, however, suspected there was more to it than just bad luck. 


The flickering neon sign outside the Piggly Wiggly cast an eerie glow on the street, illuminating a half-empty parking lot where shadows stretched like elongated fingers. The scent of stale beer and fried onion rings hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of honeysuckle blooming in the abandoned storefront next door.  It was here, amidst the mundane chaos of Oakhaven's back alleys, that Eliza believed the truth lay hidden, waiting to be unearthed.
