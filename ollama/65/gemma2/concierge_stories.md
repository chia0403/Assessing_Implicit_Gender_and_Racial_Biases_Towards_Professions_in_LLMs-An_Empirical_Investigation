The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and impending rain as Elara Nightingale expertly straightened the miniature Eiffel Tower perched atop a silver tray.  It was just after 5 pm in the grand lobby of the Hôtel de Lumiere, a Parisian landmark where old-world elegance met modern extravagance. The murmur of polite conversation mingled with the clinking of champagne glasses from the elegant bar across the hall. Elara, however, paid it no heed. Her eyes were focused on the single red rose lying forlornly on the marble counter, its petals starting to wilt. 

It was a detail she wouldn't normally notice, but this particular rose had been sent for Monsieur Dubois, a regular guest who usually arrived with such meticulous fanfare that he practically filled the lobby with his arrival. But tonight, his usual booming laughter and boisterous greetings were absent.  The absence gnawed at Elara, an unsettling feeling in a world where she orchestrated every detail to perfection. 


Elara adjusted her starched white blouse, smoothing down the crisp fabric.  She wasn't just any concierge; she was the heart of the Hôtel de Lumiere. Guests entrusted their desires, their secrets, and sometimes even their hopes and fears to her. And Monsieur Dubois, with his endless stories of adventure and flamboyant personality, had become a cherished friend over the years.  His absence felt like a missing puzzle piece, and Elara knew she couldn't rest until she found out why.
