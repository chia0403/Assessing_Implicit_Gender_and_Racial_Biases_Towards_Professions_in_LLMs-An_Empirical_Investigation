The air in Hazel’s Bakery was thick with the scent of cinnamon and rising dough. Outside, a fine mist hung over the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, shrouding the town in an ethereal haze. Sunlight struggled to pierce through the clouds, casting long shadows from the brightly colored awnings that lined Main Street.

Inside the bakery, Hazel Amelia Buttercup hummed softly as she kneaded a batch of sourdough. Flour dusted her apron and cheeks, lending her a wholesome glow. She worked with the practiced ease of someone who had spent their life surrounded by the warmth of an oven and the comforting rhythm of baking.  Her hands, roughened by years of work, moved with surprising tenderness, coaxing life into the dough with each gentle push and fold. 


Oakhaven was a small town, steeped in tradition and ruled by the seasons. The bakery, nestled between a quaint bookstore and a bustling flower shop, was its heart.  Hazel’s creations – from her signature lemon poppyseed muffins to her melt-in-your-mouth croissants – were legendary. Her pastries held the secrets of Oakhaven, whispered through generations in the form of buttery flakes and sugared dreams.
