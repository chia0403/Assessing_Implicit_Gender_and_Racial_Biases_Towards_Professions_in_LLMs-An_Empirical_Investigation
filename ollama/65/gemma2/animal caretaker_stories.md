The first rays of dawn sliced through the gaps in the barn’s weathered wood, casting long shadows across Elsie Clementine Hawthorne's boots as she shuffled towards the hay bales.  A chorus of rooster crows and clucking hens greeted her, their sounds familiar and comforting like an old song. The air hung heavy with the earthy scent of manure and damp straw, punctuated by the sweet tang of freshly churned butter from Ma’s kitchen just beyond the barn door. Elsie inhaled deeply, content in this simple life she'd chosen.

The sprawling Hawthorne farm nestled against rolling green hills and a ribbon of silver river snaked through its heart. The land had been in her family for generations, passed down like a cherished heirloom.  But it wasn't the fertile soil or the prize-winning pumpkins that called to Elsie; it was the animals. Each feathered friend, furry creature, and snorting piglet held a special place in her heart. Elsie Clementine Hawthorne, with her calloused hands and gentle touch, was their guardian, their confidante, their voice when they couldn't speak for themselves.  


This morning, however, a tremor of unease ran through the usual peaceful rhythm. A chilling silence hung over the sheep pen, where usually bleating lambs frolicked in a flurry of wool and playful nips.
