The fluorescent hum of the Save-Rite bodega was Amelia Beatrice Finch's constant companion. She knew every flicker in the lightbulbs above her head, every sticky spot on the linoleum floor, every creak in the warped doorframe leading to the back office. It wasn't glamorous, but it was predictable. 

Amelia rang up a customer's lottery tickets with practiced ease, their numbers punching into the register like familiar Morse code. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt parking lot, painting the faded yellow stripes a sickly orange. The air hung thick and humid, promising another sweltering night in their nameless New Jersey town, just off exit 12 on the interstate. 


Amelia leaned back against the countertop, her elbows resting on the chipped Formica. She watched the clock tick down to closing time, its relentless hands a metronome marking the passage of another mundane day.
