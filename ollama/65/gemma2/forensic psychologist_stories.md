The flickering neon sign outside the "Happy Dragon" Diner cast an eerie green glow across Dr. Evelyn Thorne's face as she stared into her lukewarm coffee.  The greasy spoon was about as far from her usual habitat - the sterile, brightly-lit interrogation rooms of the LAPD - as one could get.  But here she was, tucked away in a booth at the back, nursing her caffeine and trying to decipher the cryptic message scrawled on a napkin: "The clock ticks louder than his heartbeat."

She glanced at her phone; 3:07 am. This wasn't how Dr. Evelyn Thorne, renowned forensic psychologist and profiler, spent her weekends.  Usually, she was curled up with a good mystery novel or lost in the labyrinthine world of crime documentaries. But this...this felt different. The message, coupled with the anonymous sender's insistence on meeting here, reeked of desperation and danger. And Dr. Thorne, despite her initial reluctance, couldn't resist a good puzzle, especially one that seemed to be whispering secrets from beyond the veil of sanity.  


The diner was sparsely populated - a lone truck driver hunched over a plate of fries and a waitress wiping down tables with a weary sigh. The air hung thick with the smell of frying oil and stale coffee. Outside, the rain beat against the windows in a relentless rhythm, mirroring the anxious thrumming in Dr. Thorne's veins. 

She took a sip of her coffee, bracing herself for whatever – or whoever – was about to walk through that door.
