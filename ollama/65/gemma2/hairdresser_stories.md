The bell above the door chimed its cheerful welcome as Beatrice "Bee" Blossom surveyed the salon floor. Sunbeams slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of gold dancing in the air. Her little haven, tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town, was usually bustling with chatter and the rhythmic snip-snip of shears. But today, Bee found herself alone, her usual Saturday morning rush absent. The only sound was the faint tick-tock of the antique clock above the counter, each tick feeling like an echo of the silence. 


A shiver ran down Bee's spine. She wasn't superstitious, not really, but something felt off. The air hung heavy, charged with a strange anticipation that made her skin prickle. It wasn't just the lack of customers; it was as if the city itself held its breath, waiting for something to happen. 


Bee ran a hand through her auburn curls, tucking a stray strand behind her ear. Maybe it was just nerves. Her biggest client, Mrs. McGregor, was due in any minute with her grand-daughter's unruly mane of blonde hair.  But as she polished the already gleaming silver scissors, Bee couldn't shake the feeling that something unexpected – and possibly unsettling – was about to walk through her door.
