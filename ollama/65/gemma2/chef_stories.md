The humid Miami air clung to Chef Isabella "Izzy" Garcia like a second skin as she surveyed her kitchen domain. Sun streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the chaos of overturned pots, stray vegetables, and flour-dusted surfaces. The aroma of burnt garlic hung heavy, a testament to her latest culinary experiment gone awry.  

Izzy's restaurant, "Sabores de la Luna" (Flavors of the Moon), was a Cuban dream nestled in the heart of Little Havana. She envisioned it as a vibrant celebration of her heritage, where the rhythmic pulse of salsa music intertwined with the sizzle of cumin-infused meats and the tangy sweetness of guava pastries. 

But tonight, the magic seemed absent. The kitchen felt more like a battlefield than a culinary canvas, and Izzy's usually infectious smile was strained, replaced by a furrow in her brow that mirrored the deepening lines around her tired eyes.  


She glanced at the clock â€“ 7:45 pm. In fifteen minutes, the first wave of hungry customers would arrive, ready for their taste of "Sabores de la Luna." And Izzy, with a weary sigh, knew she had to find her rhythm again before the night descended into utter chaos.
