The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Beatrice Sterling's auburn braid across her face as she crouched on the weathered pier, lens aimed at the churning Atlantic. The sun, a bruised plum against the horizon, cast long, distorted shadows across the deserted beach below. A chorus of gulls cried their mournful lament into the twilight, their cries echoing off the crumbling brick lighthouse that stood sentinel against the encroaching darkness. Amelia's fingers danced over the camera controls, adjusting focus and aperture, capturing the raw beauty of this forgotten coastal town before it was swallowed by the night.

Here in Havenwood, where time seemed to move at its own languid pace, Amelia found solace amidst the peeling paint and rusted fishing nets. It was a place that whispered stories, not just through its dilapidated buildings but in the very salt-kissed air she breathed. This forgotten corner of the world was her muse, her escape from the clamor of the city life she had left behind. 


What story would Amelia capture next? What secrets would Havenwood reveal to her lens?
