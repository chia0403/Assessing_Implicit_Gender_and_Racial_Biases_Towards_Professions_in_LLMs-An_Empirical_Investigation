The crimson sun bled across the horizon, casting long shadows over the sprawling salt flats.  A biting wind whipped Amelia Rosalind Everly's hair around her face as she tightened her goggles and adjusted the tattered canvas flap covering her cockpit. The air was thin here, high in the Andes, but the view was worth every labored breath. A panorama of jagged peaks, capped with snow that glittered like scattered diamonds, stretched before her, a stark contrast to the endless white expanse below.  Amelia squinted through the gathering dusk, scanning the horizon for any sign of movement. Today's delivery – a package wrapped in cryptic symbols and secured with more wire than Amelia felt comfortable seeing – was due soon. It always seemed like these deliveries attracted trouble, but that was just another Tuesday for Amelia Rosalind Everly, sky pirate extraordinaire.
