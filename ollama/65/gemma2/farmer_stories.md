The morning mist clung to Elias Blackwood's boots like a loyal puppy, reluctant to be shaken off. He sighed, the chill air biting at his exposed skin as he trudged across his fields. Dawn was just beginning to bleed over the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the rows of corn that stretched out before him like an endless sea of emerald green. The dew-laden leaves whispered secrets in the gentle breeze, but Elias wasn't in a mood for whispers. He had a mountain of work ahead of him, and his aching back grumbled its displeasure with each step. This was life on Blackwood Farm: relentless, unforgiving, yet undeniably beautiful. 


Elias, weathered hands calloused from years of toil, tugged at his worn leather hat. The sun, finally cresting the eastern ridge, threw a warm shaft of light across his face, momentarily chasing away the morning chill. He squinted at the distant farmhouse, its silhouette stark against the rising sun. Home. A place where even the toughest farmer could find solace in the smell of freshly baked bread and the laughter of loved ones.
