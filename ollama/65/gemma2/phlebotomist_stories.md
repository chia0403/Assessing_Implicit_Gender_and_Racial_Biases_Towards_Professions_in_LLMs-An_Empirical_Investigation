The fluorescent lights hummed above Penelope Everly's head like a chorus of nervous insects, casting an anemic glow over the sterile walls of Mercy General's blood bank.  Penelope, affectionately nicknamed "Penny" by her coworkers, deftly cleaned a gauze pad with a swift swipe and held it against the crook of Mrs. Henderson's elbow.

Mrs. Henderson, a petite woman with eyes that held a lifetime of stories, was already fidgeting in her chair, her gaze flitting between the needle poised above her arm and Penelope's calm face. It was a familiar scene for Penny; she’d seen countless patients like Mrs. Henderson over her years as a phlebotomist – scared, anxious, even angry. But she understood their apprehension. A simple prick could feel monumental when your blood was being pulled from you.

The air in the room smelled faintly of antiseptic and fear, a potent mix that Penelope had grown accustomed to. Outside, the city thrummed with its usual cacophony – car horns blaring, sirens wailing, laughter spilling out from open windows. But here, within the confines of the blood bank, the world was quiet, hushed by the unspoken anxieties of those seeking solace in a transfusion or donating a precious life force.


Penny took a deep breath, her gaze steady on Mrs. Henderson's arm. "Just relax," she said softly, her voice a balm against the tension in the room. "It'll be over before you know it."
