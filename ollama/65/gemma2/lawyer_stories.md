The rain hammered against the windowpane of Amelia Grace Blackwood's office, blurring the already grey Chicago skyline. It was the kind of day that begged for hot cocoa and a good book, not the mountain of legal documents piled precariously on her mahogany desk. 

Amelia ran a hand through her dark, unruly curls, sighing as she reread the contract for the tenth time. The case, involving a disputed land claim in rural Kansas, was proving to be more tangled than a bowl of overcooked spaghetti. She needed a solution, and fast. 


The rhythmic drumming of the rain became a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of her fingers on the keyboard as she drafted a rebuttal email to opposing counsel.  This wasn't just another case; it represented the livelihood of her client, a struggling farmer facing financial ruin if he lost. Amelia wouldn't let that happen. Not if she could help it.
