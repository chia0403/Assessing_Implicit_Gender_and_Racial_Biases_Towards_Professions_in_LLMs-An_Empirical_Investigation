The hum of the engines vibrated through Amelia "Amy" Hayes's teeth as she prepped for boarding. Her reflection in the galley window showed a practiced calm, but her stomach churned with a nervous energy. This wasn't just any flight; this was Flight 347 to Reykjavik, a notorious route known for its turbulent weather and unpredictable passengers.  

The plane itself was a Boeing 767, a mid-sized workhorse of the skies, nicknamed "Valkyrie" by the crew for her tendency to weather any storm. Amy liked Valkyrie – she felt safe in her metal wings, despite the gnawing anxiety that always accompanied takeoff. The setting sun cast long shadows across the tarmac of JFK Airport, painting the scene in shades of orange and purple.  Passengers streamed towards the boarding gate, a cacophony of luggage wheels and hurried chatter filling the air.  Amy smoothed down her crisp uniform, the airline's signature blue blazer accentuating her warm hazel eyes. She took a deep breath, trying to quell the butterflies fluttering in her stomach. This was her job, her passion – connecting people across continents, weaving stories in the clouds. And today, she had a feeling that story was going to be a particularly interesting one.
