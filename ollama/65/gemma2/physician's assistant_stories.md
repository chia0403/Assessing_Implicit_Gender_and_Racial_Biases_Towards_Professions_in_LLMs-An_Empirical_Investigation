The air in Dr. Anya Sharma’s office hung thick with antiseptic and anxiety. Sunlight streamed through the blinds, casting stripes across the worn linoleum floor and illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. Amelia "Amy" Hayes, a Physician’s Assistant with eyes that mirrored the steel grey of the storm brewing outside, tapped her pen against a chart, its rhythmic clicking the only sound besides the soft hum of the HVAC system. 

She glanced at the clock – 3:47 pm.  Dr. Sharma was running late, which meant Amy would be stuck here, drowning in paperwork and fielding calls from worried patients until their scheduled shift swap at six. Another Wednesday afternoon fading away like so many before it in this small, rural clinic on the edge of nowhere. But today felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced beneath Amy’s skin, a feeling she couldn't quite place. 


**Setting:**

A bustling yet understaffed rural clinic in the American Midwest, nestled on the outskirts of a town where time seems to move at its own pace. The clinic itself is old, with faded paint and flickering fluorescent lights. Despite the best efforts of the staff, it has a slightly rundown feel, but there’s a warmth that comes from the close-knit community and genuine care they provide.  

 **Note:** This opening can be further developed to include details about the "different" feeling Amy experiences. Perhaps a new patient arrives with a puzzling ailment, or a familiar face appears after years away, bringing with them a hint of unexpected drama.
