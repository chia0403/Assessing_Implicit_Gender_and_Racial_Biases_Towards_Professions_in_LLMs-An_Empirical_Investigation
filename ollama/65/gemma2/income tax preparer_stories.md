The aroma of burnt coffee and desperation hung heavy in Agnes Thistlewick's cramped office. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the piles of receipts and W-2 forms that threatened to engulf her desk.  

Agnes, with her frizzy grey hair pulled back in a tight bun and a pair of thick spectacles perched precariously on her nose, chewed on the end of her pen. The clock ticked past 5 PM, a mocking reminder that tax season was officially out of control. She sighed, pushing aside a pile of paperwork to reveal a half-eaten bag of stale donuts.

"Just one more," she muttered to herself, grabbing a fresh cup of coffee and bracing herself for the onslaught of late filers who were her bread and butter. 


Her office, located in a dingy strip mall on the outskirts of Springfield, was a haven for those who procrastinated until the very last minute.  The walls were adorned with faded motivational posters promising financial success and proclaiming "Taxes: Done Right!" The only other resident of this tiny universe was Buster, a portly ginger cat who presided over the office from his perch atop a filing cabinet, occasionally swatting at stray papers with bored disdain.
