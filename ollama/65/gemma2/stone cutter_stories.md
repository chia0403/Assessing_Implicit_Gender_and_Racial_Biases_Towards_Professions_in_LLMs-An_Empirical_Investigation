The dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight piercing through the grime-coated window, illuminating Alistair Finch's calloused hands as they carefully chipped away at the rough granite block. His workshop, nestled deep within the labyrinthine streets of Oldwick, was a cavernous space echoing with the rhythmic clang of hammer against stone.

Oldwick itself was a city steeped in history, its cobbled streets winding like veins through a tapestry woven from ancient brick and weathered timber. The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, punctuated by the tang of iron from the nearby forge district. Above, the sky was perpetually overcast, as if the weight of centuries pressed down upon the city, blurring the line between day and night. 

Alistair, a man hardened by years spent wrestling with nature's raw materials, felt strangely at peace amidst the chaos. The granite yielded to his touch, its rough edges softening under his chisel, revealing the beauty hidden within. He was a sculptor of sorts, though his creations weren't intended for grand monuments or public display. Alistair crafted gravestones, each one a silent testament to a life lived and lost, a promise whispered into eternity.
