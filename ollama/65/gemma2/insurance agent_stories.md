The humid air clung to Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne like a damp shroud as she stepped out of her cherry-red 1967 Mustang. The Florida sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, turning it into a shimmering mirage. Cicadas buzzed their incessant symphony from the towering oaks lining the street.  Eleanor adjusted the floral print of her dress, smoothing down the wrinkles that had formed during her drive across town. 

This wasn't exactly what she envisioned when she'd dreamt of being an insurance agent. She’d pictured sleek glass skyscrapers and sharp suits, not this sweltering heat and run-down strip mall. But the truth was, Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne had always been a bit of a dreamer, which sometimes made life less than predictable. Now, standing before a faded storefront that declared "Affordable Insurance" in peeling paint, she knew her real test wasn't about policy limits or actuarial tables – it was about facing down reality with a smile and a stack of brochures.
