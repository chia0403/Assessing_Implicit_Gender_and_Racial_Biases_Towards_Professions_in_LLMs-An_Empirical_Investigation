The rhythmic hiss of the steam room mingled with the soft murmur of conversation as Eleanor Amelia Hawthorne adjusted the temperature gauge for the third time that afternoon. It was always tricky getting the balance right; too hot, and she'd have clients complaining about wilting like overripe tomatoes; too cool, and their muscles wouldn't loosen enough to benefit from the massage therapy session they followed immediately after. 

Eleanor, or Ellie as her regulars affectionately called her, loved this little corner of the world nestled within the sprawling Wellness Haven Spa in Austin, Texas. The steam room was her domain, a sanctuary she’d meticulously curated with fragrant cedarwood and calming lavender oil blends, where anxieties melted away with each bead of perspiration. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Ellie's spine, making the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.  

The usual warmth of anticipation for a busy afternoon was absent, replaced by a gnawing sense of foreboding. As she glanced at the schedule board, her heart sank further. The first appointment was with Ms. Beatrice Cartwright, a notorious complainer, and Ellie wasn't sure if she had the emotional energy to handle the barrage of complaints that were bound to come.   


This feeling intensified as the doors to the steam room swung open, revealing a figure Ellie hadn’t expected to see.
