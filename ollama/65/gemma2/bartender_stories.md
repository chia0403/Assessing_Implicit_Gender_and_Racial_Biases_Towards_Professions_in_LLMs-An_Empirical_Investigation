The flickering neon sign outside cast an oily rainbow across the cracked asphalt of Redwood Street. Inside "Rusty's," the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, regret, and a faint hint of pine from the Christmas tree propped precariously in the corner. Behind the bar, Amelia Josephine “Amy” Carter polished a glass with practiced ease, her movements as precise and familiar as breathing. The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new customer, a man cloaked in shadows that swallowed him whole. Amy didn't look up, knowing by the way he lingered near the entrance, hesitant yet desperate for solace, that this was going to be another story unfolding on her worn countertop.  


This wasn't just any bar; it was a sanctuary for the lost and lonely, a refuge from the biting winds of reality that swept through Redwood City. And Amy, with her knowing smile and bottomless well of empathy, was its guardian.
