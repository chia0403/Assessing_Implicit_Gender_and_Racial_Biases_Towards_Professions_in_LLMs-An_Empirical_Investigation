The neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign bled onto Dr. Eleanor Vance's face, casting an unsettling green hue across her already tired features.  Rain lashed against the windows of the small clinic, each drop a tiny hammer against the pane, blurring the already hazy city lights outside. Inside, the air hung heavy with antiseptic and the faint scent of desperation. This was Rush Hour General, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Chicago's south side, where hope came bundled in white coats and fueled by caffeine stronger than most legal substances. 

Eleanor slumped deeper into her creaky chair, her hand resting on the worn leather of the armrest. The last three days had been a blur of broken bones, feverish coughs, and stories whispered through tear-stained faces. She was bone weary, the exhaustion clinging to her like a second skin, but there wasn't time for rest. Not when the city outside kept pouring its woes into this tiny room.
