The bell above the door tinkled softly as Amelia Juniper adjusted her lavender-scented diffuser. It was Tuesday afternoon, usually a quiet time in her cozy little studio nestled on Elm Street. Outside, leaves were just beginning to blush with autumn's first whispers, but inside "Juniper's Touch," warmth radiated from the worn Persian rug and flickering candles. 

Amelia inhaled deeply, the scent of eucalyptus and chamomile calming her after a particularly draining morning session with Mrs. Henderson, who insisted on recounting every detail of her grandchild's latest soccer game (apparently, the boy had scored twice). A new chime announced another client. This time, Amelia wasn't greeted by familiar chatter or the shuffling of shoes, but by an unsettling silence.  She peeked over the massage table and saw a figure shrouded in shadow, hunched in the corner of her studio.
