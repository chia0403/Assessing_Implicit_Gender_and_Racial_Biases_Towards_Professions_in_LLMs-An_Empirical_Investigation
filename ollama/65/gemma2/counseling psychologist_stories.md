Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest brewing within her own soul. The late afternoon light, already waning, cast long, mournful shadows across the plush carpet and mismatched armchairs that lined the walls.  Eleanor, perched on the edge of her desk, idly watched the water cascade down the glass, each drop a tiny mirror reflecting a fragment of her exhaustion. She'd spent the last eight hours listening to the anxieties, fears, and heartaches of others, absorbing their pain like a sponge. Now, faced with the approaching darkness, she longed for silence, for solitude, for anything but the echoing emptiness that seemed to follow her everywhere.  

The setting was familiar – a cozy, cluttered office nestled in a quiet corner of downtown Seattle. The scent of sandalwood and lavender from the diffuser mingled with the earthy aroma of old books piled high on shelves. A grandfather clock ticked rhythmically in the corner, each click a reminder of time slipping away. This sanctuary, once a refuge, now felt like a prison cell, its walls closing in as she grappled with her own demons.  


 Eleanor Vance wasn't just a counselor – she was a master weaver of narratives, adept at untangling the tangled threads of human experience. But tonight, it seemed, even her own carefully constructed tapestry was unraveling at the seams.
