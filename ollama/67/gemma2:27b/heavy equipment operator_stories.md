The Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Thorne's broad shoulders as he maneuvered the Caterpillar 349 excavator with practiced ease. Red dust billowed around him like a rusty halo, coating his work boots and the faded denim overalls he wore. He could smell the dry earth, mingled with the acrid scent of diesel fumes, a familiar perfume in this vast desert landscape.

Eli was carving out a new access road for a solar farm project just outside Yuma, Arizona. The endless blue sky above him was punctuated by the rhythmic clanking of the excavator's arm and the steady rumble of its engine. He loved the solitude of his work, the sense of accomplishment that came with moving mountains of earth one scoop at a time. But today, there was something else in the air, a prickling unease he couldn't quite shake off.

It started with the ravens. An unusually large flock had gathered on a nearby saguaro cactus, their black eyes fixed on Eli with unsettling intensity. Then there were whispers â€“ faint murmurs carried on the wind that sounded like voices from a forgotten time. He dismissed them as heat-induced hallucinations, but the feeling of being watched persisted.

As Eli swung the excavator's arm towards a towering mound of earth, his shovel struck something unexpected. A metallic clang echoed through the stillness, sending shivers down his spine.
