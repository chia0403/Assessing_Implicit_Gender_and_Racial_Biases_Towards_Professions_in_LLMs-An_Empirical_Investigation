The chainsaw screamed, tearing through ancient cedarwood like it was butter. Silas Blackwood, his face grimy with sawdust and sweat, wrestled the beastly machine, guiding its jagged teeth along the pre-cut line. The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and fresh earth, a familiar perfume that had clung to Silas since he was a boy. 

Around him, the emerald embrace of the Redwood National Park stretched as far as the eye could see. Sunbeams pierced through the towering canopy, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor where ferns unfurled like prehistoric relics.  A symphony of birdsong filled the air â€“ a chorus punctuated by the occasional guttural croak of a raven. 

Silas paused, wiping his brow with the back of his calloused hand. He squinted at the majestic cedar he was felling, its trunk wider than any man Silas knew. This one, he thought, would be worth more than just timber. It held stories within its rings, whispers of centuries gone by.
