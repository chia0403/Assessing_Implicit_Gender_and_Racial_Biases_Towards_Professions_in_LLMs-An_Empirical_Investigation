Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Elara Blackwood's already frayed nerves.  The wind howled like a banshee through the gaps in the aging wood, whipping icy tendrils around her ankles as she knelt beside a shivering foal. The little creature, barely a week old and christened "Storm" by Elara for its tumultuous entrance into the world, trembled violently, its big brown eyes wide with fear.

Elara's heart ached. She knew this storm was far from over, not just in terms of the weather, but in terms of the precarious future of Blackwood Sanctuary, the ramshackle haven she had inherited from her eccentric grandmother. 


The sanctuary housed a motley crew of rescued animals: battered horses with haunted eyes, timid sheep still bearing the scars of factory farming, and even a grumpy badger named Basil who Elara swore understood every word she said.  

But keeping Blackwood Sanctuary afloat was becoming an uphill battle. Funds were dwindling, the roof needed mending, and now this storm threatened to undo all the progress Elara had painstakingly made.
