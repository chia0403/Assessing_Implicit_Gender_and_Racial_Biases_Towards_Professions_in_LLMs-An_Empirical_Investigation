Rain hammered against the warped glass panes of Beatrice Blackwood's office window, blurring the already murky view of the cobblestone street below. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale paper and lavender polish, the latter a futile attempt by Beatrice to mask the ever-present aroma of dust and mildew that permeated the ancient building. 

Beatrice sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she meticulously tallied figures in a leather-bound ledger. The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of invoices, receipts, and crumpled parchment. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the window frames and sending shivers down Beatrice's spine. 

She was accustomed to solitude â€“ her days spent poring over ledgers and reconciling accounts for various merchants and tradesmen in this forgotten corner of London. But tonight, something felt different. A prickling unease settled upon her, a sense that the storm raging outside mirrored a tempest brewing within the very walls of her office.
