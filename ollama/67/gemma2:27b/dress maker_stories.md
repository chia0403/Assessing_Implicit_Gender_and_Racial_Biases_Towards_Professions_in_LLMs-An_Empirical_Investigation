The air in Esme Evangeline Dubois' atelier hung thick with the scent of lavender sachet powder and singed silk thread. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing above bolts of emerald velvet and ruby brocade. Esme herself, her fingers stained purple from a particularly stubborn dyeing process, hunched over a dress form draped in yards of ivory Chantilly lace.

Outside, the cobblestone streets of Paris bustled with life - hawkers cried their wares, carriages rumbled past, and the rhythmic clip-clop of horses' hooves echoed through the narrow alleys. But within Esme's atelier, time seemed to slow. It was a sanctuary, a haven from the clamor and chaos of the city, where her imagination could take flight and dreams were stitched into reality.

Today, however, a thread of unease snaked its way through Esme's usual tranquility. A mysterious commission had arrived, tucked between orders for debutante gowns and wedding dresses. The client was anonymous, their request only hinting at the dress's purpose: "a gown fit for a queen, but one who walks unseen."
