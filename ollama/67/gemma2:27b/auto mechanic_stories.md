The air hung thick with the scent of gasoline and motor oil, a familiar perfume to Elias Blackwood. He wiped a greasy hand across his brow, leaving a black streak against his tanned skin. The midday sun streamed through the open bay door of Blackwood's Garage, illuminating the dusty concrete floor and the hulking form of a 1967 Mustang Shelby GT500 in need of some serious TLC. Elias leaned against the hood, his calloused fingers tracing the faded racing stripes.

Blackwood’s Garage wasn’t much to look at - a corrugated iron shed nestled between a laundromat and a pawn shop on the edge of Harmony Creek.  But inside, Elias was king. He knew every bolt, every wire, every creak and groan of a car like the back of his hand. This town relied on him – farmers with sputtering tractors, teenagers with souped-up jalopies, and even the occasional weary traveler with a broken-down RV.

Today, though, Elias wasn't feeling his usual mechanical mojo. Something was off. A tightness in his chest, an itch under his skin he couldn't quite scratch. He glanced at the clock - 1:32 pm.  Right on time.

Then the bell above the door jingled, and a chill ran down Elias' spine. He knew that sound. Knew who it was.
