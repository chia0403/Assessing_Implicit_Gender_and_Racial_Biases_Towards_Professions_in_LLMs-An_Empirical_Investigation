The sun, a relentless eye peering through the canopy of ancient oaks, beat down on Elias Thornwood's neck as he wrestled with the stubborn tangle of ivy snaking up the crumbling stone fountain. Beads of sweat trickled down his temples, mingling with the dirt already caked there from a morning spent battling overgrown rose bushes.

The grounds of Blackwood Manor were Elias' domain. He knew every twist of the wisteria-covered arbors, every ripple in the lily pond, every secret path hidden amongst the towering rhododendrons. For twenty years, he had tended this grand estate with meticulous care, his gnarled hands coaxing life from the earth and shaping its unruly beauty.

But today, something felt different. A disquiet hummed beneath the usual symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves. The air hung thick and expectant, like a taut bowstring waiting to be released. 


Elias straightened, wiping his brow with the back of his hand. He couldn't shake the feeling that Blackwood Manor was holding its breath, waiting for something momentous to occur.
