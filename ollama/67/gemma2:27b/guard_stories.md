Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the watchtower, blurring the already indistinct shapes of the Ironwood Forest below. The wind howled like a tormented beast, rattling the ancient timbers that held aloft the tower's ramshackle roof. Within its cramped confines, huddled Elara Vance, her cloak pulled tight against the chill. She peered into the swirling grey abyss, searching for any flicker of movement amongst the skeletal trees, her hand instinctively tightening on the hilt of her sword. 

Ironwood was no place for the faint of heart. Legend spoke of ancient horrors lurking within its depths – creatures twisted by dark magic and driven mad by centuries of isolation. Elara had never seen one herself, but she'd heard enough whispered tales to keep her senses sharpened and her courage ever vigilant.  Tonight, however, the forest seemed eerily silent, the only sound the relentless wind and rain drumming a mournful tattoo against the tower walls.

Elara shifted her weight, her joints protesting after hours of unwavering watch. Her gaze drifted towards the worn map hanging on the wall, its edges frayed and stained with time.  A red circle marked their position – a lonely outpost at the edge of civilization. Beyond it lay the sprawling darkness of Ironwood, a chilling reminder of the dangers that lurked just beyond her sight.
