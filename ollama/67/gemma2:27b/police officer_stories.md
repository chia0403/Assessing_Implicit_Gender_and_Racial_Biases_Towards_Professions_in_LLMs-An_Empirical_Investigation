The neon sign of the "Golden Goose" diner flickered, casting an anemic green glow on Detective Isabella "Izzy" Ramirez's rain-soaked trench coat.  The smell of stale coffee and greasy bacon assaulted her nostrils as she pushed through the door, its bell jangling like a warning knell. Inside, truckers with weary eyes slurped lukewarm soup, teenagers huddled over milkshakes, giggling nervously, and an elderly couple shared a plate of fries, their faces etched with a lifetime of unspoken stories. Izzy scanned the room, her gaze sharp and unwavering. She was searching for someone - anyone - who might have seen something, anything, that could shed light on the disappearance of young Maria Flores, vanished without a trace three days ago. The diner, nestled in the heart of the gritty industrial district, seemed to hold its breath, waiting, like Izzy, for an answer to emerge from the shadows.
