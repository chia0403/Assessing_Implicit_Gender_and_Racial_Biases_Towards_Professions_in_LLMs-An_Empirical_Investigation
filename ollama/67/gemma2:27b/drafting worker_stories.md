Rain lashed against the dusty windows of the drafting room, mimicking the frantic tapping of Elara Finch's pencil on her vellum sheet. Outside, the city of Veridia hummed with its usual chaotic symphony: the clang of trams, the distant screech of steam-powered contraptions, and the incessant rumble of carriages on cobblestone streets. Inside, however, a hush reigned save for Elara's pencil and the occasional sigh escaping her lips. She was wrestling with a particularly stubborn gear mechanism, one destined for the newest automaton model being developed by the esteemed Finch & Sons Engineering firm â€“ a firm she was both proud to work for and perpetually terrified of disappointing.


Elara chewed on her lower lip, scrutinizing the intricate lines depicting cogs, sprockets, and levers. The faint scent of oil and graphite lingered in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the mounting pressure. She was the only female draftsperson in the firm, a fact she wore with both pride and trepidation.  Her father, the founder of Finch & Sons, had instilled in her a love for mechanics and a keen eye for detail. Yet, she constantly felt the weight of expectation on her shoulders, the need to prove herself worthy of the legacy she carried.

Today, that pressure seemed particularly acute. The lead engineer, Mr. Thornton, was known for his curt demeanor and unwavering standards. Elara knew one misstep could mean weeks of extra work or, worse, a demotion back to mundane blueprint copying.
