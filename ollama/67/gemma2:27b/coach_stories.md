The humid Georgia air clung to Elias Blackwood like a second skin as he surveyed his players. Sweat beaded on his brow, mirroring the droplets forming on the dew-laden grass of the practice field. Sunbeams, slanting through the ancient oak trees bordering the pitch, painted shifting patterns on the worn turf. The rhythmic thud of footballs meeting pads punctuated the air, a symphony Elias knew by heart after twenty years of coaching at Cedar Creek High.

But today, something felt different. A restless energy buzzed beneath the surface, mirroring the storm brewing on the horizon.  His star quarterback, Marcus "The Cannon" Carter, hadn't shown up yet, and whispers of discontent rippled through the team. This wasn't just another practice; tonight was their chance to secure a spot in the state championships. The weight of expectation hung heavy over Elias' shoulders. He needed to rally his players, but first, he needed to figure out what was going on with Marcus.
