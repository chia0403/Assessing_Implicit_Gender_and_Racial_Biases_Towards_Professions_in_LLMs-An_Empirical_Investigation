The stale air conditioning hummed like a bored beehive as Eloise Beaumont wrestled a rogue suitcase into the overhead compartment. It was 3:00 am in Dubai International Airport, and the pre-dawn darkness pressed against the windows, reflecting the exhaustion in Eloise's eyes. This flight to Tokyo was her fifth this week, each leg blurring into the next in a dizzying carousel of hurried meals, forced smiles, and endless safety demonstrations.  

She longed for something beyond the recycled air and plastic cups, a life with a bit more oxygen and less turbulence. But for now, Eloise had a plane to board and a hundred passengers to shepherd towards their dreams (or at least their connecting flights). She plastered on her brightest smile, adjusted her crisp uniform, and prepared to face another journey into the endless blue.
