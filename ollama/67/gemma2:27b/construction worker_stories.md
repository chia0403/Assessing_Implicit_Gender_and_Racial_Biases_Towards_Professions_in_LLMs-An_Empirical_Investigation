The morning mist clung to the steel girders like wispy ghosts, obscuring the view from the top floor of the half-built skyscraper.  Beneath him, the city was waking up, a symphony of car horns and distant sirens rising with the sun. Bartholomew "Bart" McKinley adjusted his hardhat, squinting through the haze at the sprawling construction site below. Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight, illuminating the intricate network of scaffolding and cranes that resembled a giant metal spider web.

Today was Bart's 40th birthday, but there wouldn't be any cake or balloons on this windswept perch. He wasn't one for celebrations, preferring the rhythm of his work to the chaos of parties.  He inhaled deeply, the crisp air laced with the scent of concrete and diesel fuel â€“ a familiar perfume he'd come to cherish over his twenty years in construction. Today was just another day, another step closer to finishing this behemoth of glass and steel that would soon pierce the city skyline.
