The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the sweet perfume of sawdust.  Jasper "Jaz" Hawthorne, his apron stained crimson like an abstract painting, expertly cleaved a rib roast with a practiced sweep of his cleaver. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windowpanes of Hawthorne's Meats, casting long shadows across the tiled floor littered with bone chips and discarded newspaper. Jaz hummed a jaunty tune as he worked, oblivious to the rhythmic thumping emanating from the back alley. 

It was Tuesday morning, just past eight o'clock, and while most folks in Oakhaven were starting their day with coffee and toast, Jaz was already knee-deep in the visceral symphony of his craft. He prided himself on his butchery, seeing it not as a mere job but as an art form.  Each cut, each slice, was executed with precision and respect for the animal that had given its life. 

But today, something felt different. A prickling unease danced along Jaz's spine, a subtle discordant note in the familiar symphony of his day. The thumping from the alley grew louder, punctuated by a muffled grunt. He paused, cleaver hovering mid-air, and listened intently. It wasn't the sound of usual Tuesday morning deliveries. This was something else entirely.
