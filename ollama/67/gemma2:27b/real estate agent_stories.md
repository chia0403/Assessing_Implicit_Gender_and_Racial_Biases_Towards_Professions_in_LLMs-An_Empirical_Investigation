The salt air whipped Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she trudged up the crumbling stone steps of the abandoned lighthouse. Seagulls shrieked overhead, their cries echoing eerily in the cavernous interior. Amelia grimaced; this was not how she envisioned spending a Saturday afternoon. 

She'd taken on the listing for the lighthouse – officially known as "Seawatch Point" –  on a whim, seduced by its weathered charm and breathtaking ocean views. But now, staring at the peeling paint, rusted railings, and cobwebs thick enough to ensnare a small bird, she regretted her impulsive decision.

This wasn't just any dilapidated property; it held whispers of a forgotten past, an air of mystery that both intrigued and unnerved Amelia. Local legends spoke of a tragic shipwreck decades ago, the lighthouse keeper's wife lost at sea, her ghost said to roam the lantern room, forever searching for her lost love. 


Amelia tightened her grip on her flashlight, its beam cutting through the gloom. It was time to face her fears – and perhaps uncover the secrets hidden within Seawatch Point's weathered walls.
