The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Castillo like a second skin as she adjusted the microphone strapped to her headband. Sweat already beaded on her brow, despite the fact that class wouldn't start for another five minutes. She surveyed the mirrored room, its walls adorned with motivational quotes and posters showcasing impossibly toned bodies.  

Amelia loved this space – it was her sanctuary. The thumping bass of pre-workout music pulsed through her veins, energizing her. Outside, the sun beat down relentlessly on Miami Beach, but in here, she could create a different world, one where bodies moved in sync, pushing limits and finding strength. Today's class was "Beach Boot Camp," designed to mimic the intensity of a seaside workout. Amelia grinned – she knew just how to make her students feel like they were battling ocean waves and sand dunes, all without leaving the cool comfort of the studio.
