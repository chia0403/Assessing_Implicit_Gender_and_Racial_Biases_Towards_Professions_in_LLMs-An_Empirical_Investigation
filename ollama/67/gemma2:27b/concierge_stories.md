Rain lashed against the arched windows of The Beaumont Hotel, blurring the twinkling lights of London into a shimmering watercolour. Inside, however, warmth emanated from the grand fireplace in the lobby, casting flickering shadows on the opulent velvet furniture and polished marble floors. Esmeralda Finchwick, impeccably dressed in her midnight-blue uniform, stood poised at her mahogany desk like a sentinel guarding against the storm raging outside.

Esmeralda wasn't just any concierge; she was the heart and soul of The Beaumont. With piercing emerald eyes that missed nothing and a smile that could disarm even the grumpiest guest, Esmeralda knew everyone who walked through those ornate doors: their preferences, their quirks, and sometimes, their deepest secrets. Tonight, however, the usual hum of arrival buzz was absent. Only the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner punctuated the silence.

Suddenly, a figure emerged from the swirling mist outside, their silhouette shrouded by a heavy coat and dripping umbrella. Esmeralda straightened, her gaze alert as the figure approached. This wasn't a regular guest; there was an air of urgency about them, a tension that crackled in the stillness of the lobby.
