The air hung thick with the smell of hairspray and anticipation. Sunlight streamed through the dusty front window of "Curl Up & Dye," illuminating motes dancing in its path.  It was 8:57 am, three minutes before opening time, and Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery hummed along to Ella Fitzgerald's voice crooning from the vintage radio perched precariously on a stack of hair magazines. Bea, with her fiery red curls perpetually escaping their braid and a smattering of freckles across her nose, surveyed her domain: the three mismatched salon chairs, the chipped porcelain sink with its antique faucet, and the walls adorned with framed black-and-white photographs of Hollywood icons sporting gravity-defying hairstyles. Today was going to be a big day. Beatrice had been chosen to style Mayor Mildred McMillan's hair for the town's annual Strawberry Festival Gala, an honor rarely bestowed upon a fledgling stylist like herself.  


As she reached for her favorite comb, a silver one with mother-of-pearl inlay, Bea couldn't help but wonder if this was her chance to finally make "Curl Up & Dye" the bustling haven of beauty she always dreamed it would be.
