Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the abandoned factory, blurring the skeletal outline of cranes and rusted machinery beyond. The air hung thick with the scent of damp concrete and decaying metal, punctuated by the occasional shriek of wind whistling through broken panes. Inside, huddled over a flickering laptop screen bathed in the cold blue glow of its LED backlight, sat Alistair Finchley, his brow furrowed in concentration.

Tonight's challenge resided within the crumbling walls of this former industrial giant â€“ an ancient network humming with a life force that seemed impossibly persistent for its age. A digital ghost in the machine, Alistair mused, a whisper from a time long gone, begging to be understood.
