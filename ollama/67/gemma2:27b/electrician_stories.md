The flickering neon sign outside the "Lucky Horseshoe Saloon" cast an unsettling green glow onto Ezra Bartholomew's grease-stained overalls. He squinted through the haze of cigarette smoke and cheap whiskey fumes, trying to locate the source of the buzzing that was making his teeth ache. It wasn't uncommon for saloons in Dustbowl Gulch to have faulty wiring; folks were more interested in drowning their sorrows than paying a decent electrician. 

Ezra, however, prided himself on his work. He saw the flickering lights and sparking outlets not as nuisances but as challenges, puzzles begging to be solved. Tonight's puzzle, though, was particularly complex. The buzzing seemed to emanate from deep within the saloon walls, a low hum that vibrated through Ezra's boots.  He tugged on his toolbox, the worn leather creaking in protest, and braced himself for what he knew would be a long night.
