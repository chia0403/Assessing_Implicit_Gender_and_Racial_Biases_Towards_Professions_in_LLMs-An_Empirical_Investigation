Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Cartwright's office, blurring the twinkling cityscape below into an impressionist painting of light and shadow.  She hadn't bothered drawing the blinds – the gloom mirrored her mood perfectly.

Amelia, CEO of Cartwright Innovations, was staring at a spreadsheet that looked less like a financial report and more like a declaration of war. Their latest project, a revolutionary AI-powered medical diagnostic tool, was hemorrhaging money. Delays plagued every stage of development, investor confidence was waning, and the board meeting tomorrow promised to be a bloodbath.

The click of her heels against the polished marble floor was the only sound in the cavernous office. Amelia ran a hand through her short auburn hair, its fiery colour somehow dulled by the weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders. 

She had poured her heart and soul into Cartwright Innovations – building it from the ground up after inheriting just a handful of patents from her late father. Now, this project, her magnum opus, threatened to unravel everything she'd worked for.
