The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony above Theodore "Theo" Finch's head as he pushed his battered janitorial cart down the echoing hallway. The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and stale coffee, the ever-present aroma of St. Sybil's Academy for Gifted Young Minds. Theo had been cleaning these hallowed halls for fifteen years, witnessing generations of prodigies walk through its doors â€“ future Nobel laureates, celebrated artists, even a rumored superhero or two. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A disquiet hummed beneath the surface, an unsettling vibration that resonated in Theo's bones. The usual symphony of late-night studying and whispered gossip had been replaced by an unnerving silence. Even the portraits lining the walls seemed to stare at him with a newfound intensity.  

Theo paused outside the grand library, its mahogany doors looming like silent guardians. A sliver of moonlight pierced through a crack in the drapes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Something wasn't right. The feeling intensified, pulling Theo towards the library like an unseen force. He gripped his mop handle tighter, his knuckles turning white, and slowly pushed open the door.
