The midday sun beat down on Jasper Tiberius Finch's bald head, turning his scalp into a sizzling frying pan. He grunted, wiping sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, the greasy grime leaving streaks across his forehead. Below him, the city of Emberfall sprawled like a dusty orange tapestry, its rooftops shimmering in the heat haze. Jasper was perched precariously on the edge of the Grand Blackwood Theater's ornate clock tower, replacing a cracked slate tile.

Emberfall wasn't exactly known for its soaring architecture, most buildings hugging the ground with sturdy brick walls and sloping thatched roofs. But the Grand Blackwood, a relic from a bygone era when Emberfall was a bustling trading hub, dared to reach for the sky. Its copper dome gleamed like a giant penny, catching the sun's rays and reflecting them back down onto the cobblestone streets below.

Jasper squinted at the city, a familiar pang of loneliness tugging at his heart. He knew every chimney, every alleyway, every crooked roofline like the back of his hand. But despite his intimate knowledge of Emberfall, he still felt strangely disconnected from it all.
