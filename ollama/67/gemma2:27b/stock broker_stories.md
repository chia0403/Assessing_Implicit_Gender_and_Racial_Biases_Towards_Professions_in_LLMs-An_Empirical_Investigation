The relentless pulse of the trading floor vibrated through Alistair Finch's polished loafers like a second heartbeat. Screens flickered with neon numbers, a symphony of green and red charting the rise and fall of fortunes.  Alistair, his tailored suit as crisp as a freshly minted dollar bill, barely blinked as he absorbed the torrent of data. His eyes were sharp, calculating, constantly scanning for the slightest shift in the market's rhythm.

It was 8:45 am on a Tuesday, and the air crackled with anticipation. The bell was about to ring, signaling the opening of the New York Stock Exchange, and Alistair knew this day held the potential for monumental gains or catastrophic losses. He adjusted his cufflinks, a subtle gesture betraying the simmering tension beneath his calm facade. Today, he had a chance to prove himself - not just to his clients, but to the ghosts of his past that still haunted him.
