Rain lashed against the arched windows of Amelia Blackwood's office, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the cobblestones below. The rhythmic drumming was almost hypnotic, drowning out the insistent hum of the city outside and allowing Amelia to sink deeper into the world she was building. Spread across her drafting table were blueprints, not for any ordinary structure, but for a symphony hall unlike anything the world had ever seen.

Amelia traced her finger along the delicate curves of the proposed acoustic shell, imagining the soundwaves dancing within its intricate geometry. It wasn't just bricks and mortar she was crafting; it was an instrument itself, capable of amplifying emotions and weaving magic into every note played. The project represented a lifetime's ambition for Amelia - to create a space where music could transcend the physical and touch the very soul.
