Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Sinclair's clinic, blurring the neon sign that read "Sinclair Spine & Wellness" into a swirling kaleidoscope of color. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old building and sending shivers down Evie's spine despite the warmth radiating from the antique cast iron stove in the corner. She glanced at the clock â€“ 6:15 p.m., closing time.  

Evie sighed, rubbing her temples. The day had been long, a relentless stream of patients with crick necks, sore backs, and headaches brought on by the change in weather. As she started packing up her instruments, the bell above the door chimed, startling her. A figure stood silhouetted against the dim streetlight, rain dripping from their hooded cloak.

This was unusual.  Evie rarely had patients after six, especially on nights like this. Curiosity piqued, she straightened her floral scrubs and called out, "Welcome! I'm Dr. Sinclair. How can I help you?"
