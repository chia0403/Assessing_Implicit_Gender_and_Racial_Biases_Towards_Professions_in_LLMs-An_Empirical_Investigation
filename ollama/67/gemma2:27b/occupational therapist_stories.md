Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's already frayed nerves. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor, highlighting the chipped paint and overflowing wastebasket in the corner. This wasn't exactly the state-of-the-art facility Amy had envisioned when sheâ€™d left her cushy city job to open a practice in rural West Virginia.

But then again, life rarely followed the script. 

Amy sighed, pushing away a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her braid. She'd been working non-stop since sunrise, juggling appointments with paperwork and battling the persistent urge to call it quits and retreat back to the comfort of her urban roots. The isolation was gnawing at her, the silence broken only by the mournful howl of wind outside and the occasional creak of the ancient building.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled her. Amy straightened up, plastering a smile onto her face as she called out, "Just a moment!" Her heart thumped in her chest. Could it be another patient? Or perhaps someone finally interested in buying this dilapidated building? Whatever it was, it promised a welcome distraction from the ever-present weight of her self-doubt.
