The whir of the KitchenAid mixer battled with the insistent trill of Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's phone.  Flour dusted the air like fine snow, catching the afternoon sunlight slanting through the bakery window and illuminating tiny motes that danced around Amyâ€™s head.  She ignored the call, her focus laser-sharp on coaxing a perfect swirl into the buttercream frosting for Mrs. Henderson's lavender birthday cake.

Amy's small bakery, "Sugar & Spice," nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina, was a haven of sweetness. The scent of vanilla and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tangy aroma of fresh raspberries.  Outside, the cobblestone street pulsed with the rhythm of horse-drawn carriages and tourists strolling past, their eyes drawn to the charming storefront adorned with pastel window boxes overflowing with petunias.

But inside, Amy's world was a whirlwind of sugar, sprinkles, and precision.  The phone's insistent trill pierced through her concentration again. This time, she couldn't ignore it. With a sigh, she wiped her flour-dusted hands on her apron and answered the call, bracing herself for whatever chaos awaited on the other end.
