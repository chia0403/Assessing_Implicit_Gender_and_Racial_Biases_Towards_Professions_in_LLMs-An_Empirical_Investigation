The midday sun beat down on the quarry, turning the white limestone into blinding beacons. Elias Thorne wiped the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of dust and crushed rock, a familiar perfume that Elias had inhaled since he was a boy apprenticed to his father.

He surveyed the massive block before him, its pristine surface untouched by his tools. This was to be the centerpiece for the new cathedral spire â€“ a masterpiece Elias had dreamed of carving since he first saw the architect's sketches. Yet, as he raised his hammer, the image in his mind wasn't the soaring archway he envisioned, but something altogether different: a looming shadow, dark and indistinct, lurking at the edge of the quarry.
