The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile pallor over the cluttered office.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the view of the overgrown playground beyond.  Dr. Amelia Rosalind Vance sighed, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear. The stack of student files on her desk seemed to loom larger with each passing minute.

The intercom crackled to life, startling her.

Amelia took a deep breath and straightened her spine.  Ethan was new to Willow Creek, and she knew little about him except that he had been acting out in class. She hoped this meeting would be a chance to understand what lay beneath his troubled exterior.
