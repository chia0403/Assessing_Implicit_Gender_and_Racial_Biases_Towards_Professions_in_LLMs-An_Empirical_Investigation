Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Mercy General Hospital, blurring the neon glow from the pharmacy sign across the street. Inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Finch meticulously wiped down her workstation with an alcohol wipe, the scent sharp and sterile. The usual midday lull had settled over the phlebotomy lab, leaving Ellie alone with the rhythmic hum of the centrifuge and the phantom sting of a thousand needles pricked into her memory.

She glanced at the clock, its red digits mockingly blinking 1:32 pm.  Ellie longed for a break, but knew it wouldn't come. Dr. Ramirez, notorious for his last-minute orders and impossible demands, was due any minute with a fresh batch of patients requiring bloodwork. A shiver ran down Ellie’s spine – not from the chill seeping in through the drafty window, but from the unsettling premonition that today wouldn't be ordinary. Something was brewing in the air, thick and heavy like the scent of impending thunder.
