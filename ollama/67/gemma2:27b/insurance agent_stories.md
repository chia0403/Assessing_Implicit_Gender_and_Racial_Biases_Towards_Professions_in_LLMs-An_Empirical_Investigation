Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest. He stared at the overflowing inbox on his desk, each file representing a potential claim, a whispered plea for help buried beneath reams of paperwork. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma in this dingy corner of Elm Street Insurance. Bart sighed, pushing away the image of Mrs. Henderson's tear-stained face as he recounted the tale of her flooded basement, wondering if he could somehow conjure sunshine from his own dwindling reserves of hope.  


This wasn't how Bart envisioned his life. Fresh out of college, he dreamt of adventure, of uncovering hidden truths and righting wrongs. Instead, he was stuck wading through a sea of paperwork, wrestling with disgruntled clients, and battling the ever-present fear of budget cuts that threatened to swallow him whole. But somewhere beneath the cynicism and fatigue, a spark of Bart's old idealism still flickered. He knew he had a responsibility, not just to his company, but to the people who relied on him in their moments of greatest need. Today, however, that flicker seemed dangerously close to being extinguished.
