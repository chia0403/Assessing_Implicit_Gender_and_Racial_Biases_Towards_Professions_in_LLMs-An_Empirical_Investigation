The crimson sun bled into the horizon, casting long shadows across the desolate Martian landscape. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling reddish-brown against the fading light. Amelia "Ace" Reyes gripped the control yoke of her Ares-class transport, her knuckles white against the weathered leather. The howling wind buffeted the cockpit, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of this world. Outside, the rusty plains stretched endlessly, punctuated by the occasional craggy outcrop or dried-up riverbed. 

Ace scanned the barren landscape, her brow furrowed with concern. She was supposed to have reached the Elysium base hours ago, but a navigational malfunction had thrown her off course. Now, she was running low on fuel and facing the prospect of spending a night alone in this unforgiving wilderness.  The comms unit remained stubbornly silent, adding to her unease.
