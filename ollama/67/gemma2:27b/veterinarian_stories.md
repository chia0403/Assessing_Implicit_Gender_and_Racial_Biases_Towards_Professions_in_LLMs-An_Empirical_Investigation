Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's veterinary clinic, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The ancient oak tree outside, usually a source of serene beauty, now loomed like a gnarled, menacing claw against the grey sky.  

Eleanor sighed, her breath fogging the cold glass. Three missed calls from Mrs. Henderson and her prize-winning Persian, Duchess Fluffybutt, were blinking insistently on her phone. The cat was prone to dramatic fainting spells whenever stressed, a fact that had Eleanor questioning if she’d chosen the right profession.  She loved animals, fiercely, but sometimes dealing with their neurotic owners felt like wrestling a lion in a tutu.

The bell above the door jingled, breaking the tense silence. Eleanor straightened her white coat, plastering on her best professional smile as a drenched young man stumbled into the waiting room. He clutched a shivering bundle wrapped in a towel – clearly a canine patient in distress.  Eleanor braced herself. This was going to be interesting.
