Rain lashed against the windowpane, mimicking the tempest raging inside Amelia Rose Cartwright.  Her office, usually a haven of warm wood tones and soft lighting, felt cold and oppressive tonight. Outside, the city lights blurred into an impressionist painting through the rain-streaked glass. 

Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, tapped her pen against the mahogany desk, the rhythmic click doing little to soothe her mounting anxiety.  The manila folder on her desk contained the referral for tonight's client â€“ a young man named Ethan Hayes, struggling with severe social anxiety and exhibiting signs of possible PTSD.

Ethan was Amelia's last appointment before she took a much-needed vacation. A week in the sun-drenched Caribbean had been her escape plan from the relentless emotional weight of her work. Yet, something about Ethan's case gnawed at her. His file spoke of a traumatic event, details redacted for confidentiality, but Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that this young man needed more than just standard therapy techniques. He needed someone who truly understood.
