The velvet curtain, heavy with years of dust and forgotten dreams, refused to budge. Persephone Abernathy tugged at it again, her frustration mounting. The musty scent of disuse clung to the air like cobwebs, making her lungs ache. "Bloody thing," she muttered, her voice echoing in the cavernous emptiness of the Grand Blackwood Theatre. 

Once a renowned stage for travelling troupes and ambitious local productions, the Blackwood had fallen into disrepair after its last show, a disastrous production of "Macbeth" that ended with the lead actor breaking his leg during the final battle scene. Now, years later, Persephone stood in its shadow, determined to breathe life back into its faded grandeur.

Her vision was clear: a revival of Shakespeare's "The Tempest," a play brimming with magic and second chances, mirroring her own hopes for the theatre. But first, she needed to overcome the resistance of the creaking stage, the flickering lights, and the ghosts of performances past that seemed to haunt its every corner.
