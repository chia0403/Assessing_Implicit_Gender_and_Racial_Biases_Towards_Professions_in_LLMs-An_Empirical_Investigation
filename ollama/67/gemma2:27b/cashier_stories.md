Rain hammered against the warped glass door of the Stop-N-Go, each drop exploding in a fleeting starburst. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging up the cracked plexiglass shield separating her from the storm raging outside. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting everything in a sickly yellow glow that did little to brighten the dingy interior.  She idly tapped her acrylic nails against the sticky countertop, the monotony of counting change punctuated only by the occasional forlorn beep of the register. 

It was past midnight, the graveyard shift at its loneliest. Amy longed for the bustle of the day shift, the chatter of customers, the symphony of soda cans clinking and chips rustling. Tonight, though, it felt like she was the only soul in existence, adrift in a sea of stale coffee and expired lottery tickets.  

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, startling Amy from her reverie. A figure shrouded in shadow stepped inside, the gust of wind swirling the damp air around them.
