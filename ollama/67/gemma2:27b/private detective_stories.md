Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thorne's office, blurring the neon glow of the 'Golden Dragon' bar across the street. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation - a familiar cocktail for a man like Thorne. His worn fedora sat perched precariously on his desk, next to a half-empty bottle of rye whiskey and a stack of case files that threatened to topple over at any moment. 

Thorne himself was a study in contradictions: tall and lean with the hard edges of a boxer, yet his eyes held a melancholy depth that belied his imposing physique. His trench coat, once a dapper charcoal grey, now bore the stains and wrinkles of countless rain-soaked nights chasing shadows through the city's underbelly.

Tonight, however, there was no client knocking on his door. No damsel in distress or double-crossing gambler seeking his help. Just the ceaseless drumming of rain and the echoing click of Thorne refilling his glass â€“ a lonely symphony for a man accustomed to the company of secrets.
