The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an antiseptic glow over Amelia Rose Hawthorne's workstation.  Stainless steel gleamed, reflecting her tired reflection back at her. The familiar scent of mint toothpaste and antiseptic lingered in the air, a constant reminder of the battlefield she waged daily against plaque and gingivitis. 

It was Tuesday afternoon, and the usual humdrum of patient appointments had been punctuated by an unsettling quiet. Amelia glanced at the clock â€“ 2:47 pm. The only sound in the room was the rhythmic whirring of the air purifier.  Dr. Henderson, ever punctual, was likely stuck in another lengthy consultation with a nervous first-timer.  Amelia sighed and reached for her phone, scrolling through social media to kill time. 

Suddenly, the door burst open, revealing Mrs. O'Malley, Amelia's most eccentric patient, clutching her purse like a lifeline. Her bright green eyes were wide with panic. "Amelia dear," she gasped, her voice trembling, "You have to help me! It's my dentures... they've gone missing!"  

Amelia's eyebrows shot up. This was not the usual Tuesday afternoon predicament.
