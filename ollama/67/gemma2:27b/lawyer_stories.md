Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's office, each droplet exploding in a miniature firework display. The late afternoon sun struggled to penetrate the gloom, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered desks and overflowing bookshelves. Alistair himself, a man whose life seemed perpetually shrouded in shadow, hunched over a pile of legal documents. His thin, greying hair clung damply to his forehead, reflecting the flickering light from the antique lamp on his desk.  He was known throughout the city for taking on impossible cases, those that others deemed lost causes - the forgotten, the marginalized, the unjustly accused. Today, however, even Alistair felt a tremor of doubt as he reread the case file: The People vs. Elijah Crowe.

Elijah Crowe, a young man accused of arson and manslaughter, had been abandoned by his family and shunned by his community. His only hope rested on the shoulders of Alistair Finch, a lawyer known for fighting battles no one else dared to wage.
