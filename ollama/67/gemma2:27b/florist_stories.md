Rain lashed against the greenhouse windows, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of water and light. Inside, Amelia Rosethorn hummed along to an old Ella Fitzgerald record, her nimble fingers weaving lavender sprigs into a delicate garland. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth, lilies, and the sweet, spicy tang of cinnamon roses - Amelia's favorite.

Her shop, "Rosethorn & Briar", nestled in a quiet corner of Willow Creek, was an oasis of color and fragrance amidst the dreary November day. Pots overflowed with vibrant geraniums, fuchsia orchids bloomed like jeweled butterflies, and ferns unfurled their emerald fronds towards the filtered sunlight streaming through the glass ceiling.

But today, Amelia felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Business had been slow lately, the downturn in the economy leaving people hesitant to spend on luxuries like fresh flowers. And then there was the letter she'd received that morning - a notice from her landlord informing her that rent was increasing by a significant amount. 


Amelia needed a miracle, and fast.
