The midday sun beat down on Silas "Si" Blackwood's back, turning his neon orange vest into a shimmering beacon. Sweat trickled down his temple, stinging his eyes as he tamped down another section of freshly laid asphalt. The scent of tar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the exhaust fumes from the endless stream of cars zipping past on I-80.  

Si glanced up at the endless ribbon of highway stretching before him, a concrete artery pumping lifeblood through the heart of the American West. It wasn't glamorous work, patching potholes and laying asphalt, but it was honest. And Si, with his calloused hands and quiet demeanor, took pride in keeping this vital vein flowing smoothly.

Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Si's spine as he surveyed the deserted stretch of highway ahead. The usual hum of traffic had dwindled to a low murmur, replaced by an unsettling silence broken only by the chirping of crickets and the rhythmic thump of his own hammer.
