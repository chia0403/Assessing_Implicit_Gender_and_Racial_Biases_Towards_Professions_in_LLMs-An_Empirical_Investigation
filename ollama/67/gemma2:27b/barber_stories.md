The bell above the door jingled merrily, announcing Silas Thaddeus Blackwood's first customer of the day. He glanced up from the newspaper spread across his worn leather chair, straightening the collar of his crisp white shirt. The morning sun streamed through the dusty windowpanes of "Blackwood's Barbershop," casting long shadows on the worn linoleum floor.

Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven bustled with life: hawkers yelling their wares, children chasing stray dogs, and ladies gossiping on their porches. But inside Blackwood's, time seemed to slow down. The air was thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder, a comforting aroma Silas had come to associate with order and calm. 


He smiled warmly at the young man who tentatively entered, his hair a tangled mess that begged for Silas's skilled touch. "Morning, son," Silas boomed in his deep baritone voice. "What can I do for you today?"
