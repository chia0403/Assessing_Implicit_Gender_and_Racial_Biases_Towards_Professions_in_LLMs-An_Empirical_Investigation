Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign hanging precariously above Eleanor Ainsworth's pharmacy. The incessant drumming had been going on for hours, turning the usually bustling street corner into a desolate island in a sea of gray. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and disinfectant, punctuated by the occasional cough from a lone customer browsing the aisles.

Eleanor herself stood behind the counter, idly rearranging bottles of ibuprofen while her mind wandered. Sheâ€™d been running Ainsworth Pharmacy for over ten years, ever since inheriting it from her grandfather. It was a comforting place, full of familiar scents and the quiet murmur of dispensing machines. But lately, a gnawing unease had begun to settle in Eleanor's gut.  The rain wasn't just depressing; it felt ominous, like a curtain drawn over something unseen and threatening.
