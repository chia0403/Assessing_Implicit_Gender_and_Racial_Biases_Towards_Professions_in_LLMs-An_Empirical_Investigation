Rain lashed against the cracked windowpane, mirroring the storm brewing in Esmeralda "Esme" O'Malley's gut. The ancient boiler she was wrestling with groaned like a wounded beast, spewing acrid steam that stung her nostrils.  

Her toolbox lay open on the grime-streaked floor of the basement, its contents scattered like fallen soldiers. Wrench, pliers, pipe cutter â€“ each tool felt heavier than usual, burdened by the weight of this impossible repair and the desperate pleas of Mrs. Petrov, a frail widow whose only source of heat was now wheezing its last breath.

Esme wiped sweat from her brow with the back of her grease-stained hand.  The basement air hung thick and heavy, smelling of mildew and despair. Above, thunder rattled the old Victorian house, a counterpoint to the relentless drip-drip-drip emanating from the leaky pipe Esme had been battling for the past hour.
