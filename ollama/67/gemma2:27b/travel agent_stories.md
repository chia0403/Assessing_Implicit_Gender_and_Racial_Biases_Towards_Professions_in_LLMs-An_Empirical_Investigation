Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Wanderlust Voyages," blurring the vibrant posters of sun-drenched beaches and snow-capped mountains into watercolour smudges. Eleanor Beatrice Finch sighed, her reflection staring back from the darkened glass â€“ tired eyes framed by auburn curls escaping their braid. The travel agency, usually a haven of excited chatter and map-tracing fingers, was eerily silent.

The economic downturn had hit the travel industry hard. Bookings were down, cancellations up, and Eleanor was starting to feel the pinch. She longed for the days when her phone buzzed constantly with inquiries about exotic locales and adrenaline-pumping adventures. Now, it lay stubbornly silent, a cold reminder of the shrinking world beyond her windowpane.


Eleanor straightened a crooked postcard of Machu Picchu, its vibrant colours mocking her current gloom.  She needed to shake things up, to find something, anything, that would reignite her passion for travel and save her beloved Wanderlust Voyages from sinking beneath the tide of economic woe.
