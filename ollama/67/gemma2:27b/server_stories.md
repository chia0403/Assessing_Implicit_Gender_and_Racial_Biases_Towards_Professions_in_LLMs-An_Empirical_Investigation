The neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign flickered erratically, casting an unsettling green hue across Amelia Chen's tired face. Smoke from a dozen cigarettes hung heavy in the air, mingling with the greasy scent of fried noodles and stale beer. The late-night crowd was thinning, leaving behind sticky tables and crumpled fortune cookie wrappers.

Amelia sighed, tucking a stray strand of black hair behind her ear as she balanced a tray laden with empty plates. She'd been on her feet for eight hours, her smile strained and her shoes pinching. Her reflection in the dusty mirror above the bar showed a young woman worn beyond her twenty years. The Lucky Dragon was her lifeline, but tonight it felt more like a gilded cage.
