Rain lashed against the windows of the Happy Hippo Daycare, blurring the cheerful cartoon animals painted on the glass. Amelia Cartwright sighed, watching the water streak down the pane. It was a day like any other at the daycare: sticky fingers, sing-alongs gone awry, and the constant low hum of childish chatter. Yet today, a strange unease gnawed at her.

Amelia wasn't sure what it was, but something felt off. Maybe it was the way little Timmy kept staring out the window with an unnerving intensity, or how Mrs. Henderson, usually cheerful, hadn't cracked a smile all morning. Or perhaps it was just the storm, casting long shadows across the brightly coloured playroom and amplifying every creak of the aging building. 

Whatever it was, Amelia couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that something strange was brewing beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary day.
