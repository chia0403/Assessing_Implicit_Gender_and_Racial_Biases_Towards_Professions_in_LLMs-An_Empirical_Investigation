Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

As the sun set over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins gazed out at the endless stretch of highway in front of him, his eyes squinting against the glare of the setting sun. He had been driving for hours, the hum of the Peterbilt 389's engine and the soft crackle of the CB radio his only companions since he'd left Gallup early that morning.

Hawk checked his odometer for what felt like the hundredth time that day - 447 miles to Tucson, and then another 200 to San Diego. He was running a tight schedule, and if he didn't make it on time, he'd be in for a world of trouble with his dispatcher.

**Setting:**

The desert highway stretched out before him like an endless ribbon of asphalt, punctuated by the occasional cactus or rock formation. The air was thick with the scent of creosote bush and mesquite, and the sky above was a deep shade of pink that seemed to pulse with the rhythm of the setting sun.

Hawk's truck, a battered old Peterbilt 389 he'd named "Bertha," rumbled smoothly along the highway, its headlights casting an eerie glow over the desert landscape. The CB radio crackled with static as Hawk tuned in to the local frequency, listening for any signs of traffic or road closures.

It was a hot summer evening, and the Arizona sun had been beating down relentlessly all day. But as the hours ticked by, the temperature would begin to drop, and the desert night air would grow cool and crisp. Hawk knew that if he made it through the night without incident, he'd be able to sleep soundly in his bunk, lulled by the steady rumble of Bertha's engine.

But for now, there was only the darkness gathering ahead, and the uncertainty of what lay in store for him on this long haul across the desert.
