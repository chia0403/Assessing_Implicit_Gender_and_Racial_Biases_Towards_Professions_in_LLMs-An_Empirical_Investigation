Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Dr. Elliot Thompson stepped out of his small apartment, umbrella in hand. A systems analyst at the prestigious tech firm, NovaSpire, Elliot was no stranger to the city's grey skies. But tonight felt different - tonight felt like a reckoning.

As he made his way through the crowded streets, Elliot couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the rain, which seemed to be drumming against the pavement with an otherworldly intensity. It was the sense of unease that had been building inside him for weeks, ever since he'd stumbled upon a mysterious error in one of NovaSpire's most critical systems.

Elliot had always prided himself on being a detail-oriented guy, someone who could find errors in code and optimize entire databases with ease. But this...this was different. This was like something was hiding just beneath the surface, waiting to pounce.

He quickened his pace as he turned onto 5th Avenue, his eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks for any sign of trouble. The neon lights of the bars and restaurants reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the city's nightlife. Elliot felt like he was being watched, but every time he glanced around, there was no one there.

He took a deep breath and stepped into the warm glow of the coffee shop on the corner, hoping to find some solace in the familiar rhythms of the caffeine-fueled crowd. But as he waited in line, Elliot couldn't shake the feeling that he was already too late...that whatever was coming for him had already been waiting.
