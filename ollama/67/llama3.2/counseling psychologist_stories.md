Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

Dr. Alexandra "Alex" Thompson stepped out of her office building and onto the crisp autumn morning air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the bustling streets of downtown Portland. As a counseling psychologist with a private practice on the fifth floor of the building, Alex had spent countless mornings watching the city come to life from her window perch. The sound of car horns, chatter, and coffee-fueled conversations filled the air, a constant reminder that even in the midst of a long day, there was always something new to explore.

Alex herself was no stranger to the stresses of daily life, having spent years studying the intricacies of human behavior and developing her skills as a therapist. But despite her own professional success, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a nagging sense of disconnection that had been growing inside her for months, like a slow-burning ember waiting to ignite.

As she made her way down to the street, Alex's mind began to wander to the new case file that lay on her desk, waiting for her attention. A young woman named Sarah, struggling with anxiety and feelings of isolation after losing her job a few weeks prior. Alex had already begun developing a treatment plan, but as she walked through the crowded streets, she couldn't help but wonder if she was truly equipped to help this client, or if she was just patching over symptoms instead of addressing the underlying issues that had driven Sarah to seek help in the first place.

The question echoed in her mind like a refrain, as Alex hailed a taxi and headed back to her office, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.
