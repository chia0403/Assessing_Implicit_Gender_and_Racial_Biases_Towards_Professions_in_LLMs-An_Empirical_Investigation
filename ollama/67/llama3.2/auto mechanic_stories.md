Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty Main Street and the rundown garage where 25-year-old Jackson "Jax" Ryder spent most of his days tinkering with engines and fixing broken dreams. Jax, a self-proclaimed master of machinery, had grown up in this very garage, watching his father work on cars before him and learning the ins and outs of every vehicle that crossed the shop's threshold.

As he wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand, Jax gazed out at the rows of faded signs advertising local businesses - "Sam's Hardware", "Mabel's Diner", and "Ryder's Garage" in bold letters.
