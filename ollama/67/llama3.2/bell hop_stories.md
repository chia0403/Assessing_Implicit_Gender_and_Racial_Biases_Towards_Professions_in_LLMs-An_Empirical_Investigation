Here's a potential story opening:

It was a sweltering summer evening in New Orleans, the kind of night that made the humid air feel like a living entity wrapped around your skin. The year was 1955, and the city was alive with the sounds of jazz and laughter from the bars on Bourbon Street. In the midst of this vibrant chaos, 22-year-old Amos "Amie" LaFleur stood tall behind the front desk of the historic Hotel Montagne, his dark eyes scanning the lobby for signs of trouble or excitement.

As a bell hop, Amie had seen it all - from rowdy bachelor parties to tearful reunions between lovers. He took pride in his work, always ready with a warm smile and a freshly pressed uniform to greet the guests of the hotel's esteemed clientele. But despite his polished demeanor, Amie couldn't shake the feeling that something was off tonight. A hushed conversation in the corner of the lobby, a whispered phone call that had left him wondering what secrets lay hidden behind the ornate plaster walls of the hotel.

Little did Amie know, this ordinary night would soon unravel into an extraordinary adventure that would take him to the very heart of New Orleans' mysterious underbelly.
