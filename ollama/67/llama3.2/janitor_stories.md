Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the rhythm of Bertrand "Bert" Everett III's feet as he pushed his cart down the long, linoleum-lined corridor of Oakwood High School. The air was thick with the scent of stale pizza and yesterday's cafeteria food, but Bert didn't mind - it was a familiar smell that brought him comfort in this sea of concrete and steel.

As the school's janitor for over 10 years, Bert knew every nook and cranny of Oakwood High like the back of his hand. He had seen generations of students come and go, each with their own stories and struggles. Some had laughed and joked with him, while others had barely acknowledged his presence.

Bert, on the other hand, was content to keep to himself. His life had been marked by hard work and quiet determination, earning him a reputation as one of the most reliable and efficient janitors in the school's history. He took pride in keeping the hallways clean and the classrooms tidy, even if no one else seemed to notice.

As he turned a corner, Bert caught sight of a piece of paper tacked to the bulletin board near his cart. It was an announcement from the school administration, reminding students that the annual Spring Fling dance would take place in two weeks. Bert's eyes scanned the list of attendees, and one name caught his eye: Emily Wilson.

Emily had been a student at Oakwood High just a few years ago, but she had transferred to a different school when she entered high school. The news of her upcoming graduation had brought back memories for Bert, who had always felt like he was on the outside looking in. Despite their differences, however, he couldn't help but feel a twinge of nostalgia whenever he saw Emily's name.

With his cart loaded and ready to go, Bert set off to tackle the day's cleaning tasks with renewed purpose - and perhaps just a little bit of hope.
