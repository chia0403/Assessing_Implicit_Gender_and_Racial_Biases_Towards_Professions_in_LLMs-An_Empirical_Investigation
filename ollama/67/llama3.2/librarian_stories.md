Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood Borough were always at their most melancholy in the springtime, when the last wisps of winter's chill lingered just beneath the surface of the air. It was as if the town itself was holding its breath, waiting for the warmth to return.

In the heart of this misty, grey town stood the Ashwood Public Library, a stalwart presence that had watched over generations of residents and visitors alike. Within its walls, Emilia Isobel Wilson tended the shelves with meticulous care, her fingers tracing the spines of worn novels and dog-eared paperbacks as if seeking some hidden truth.

As she shelved a particularly tattered copy of Wuthering Heights, Emilia's eyes strayed out into the drizzly afternoon light, where the rain-lashed windows seemed to blur the line between reality and the world beyond. It was a habit she'd developed over the years – this fixation on the boundaries between inside and outside – and one that often left her feeling both fascinated and unsettled.

Little did Emilia know, however, that today's dreary afternoon would be the catalyst for a change that would shake the foundations of Ashwood Borough forever.
