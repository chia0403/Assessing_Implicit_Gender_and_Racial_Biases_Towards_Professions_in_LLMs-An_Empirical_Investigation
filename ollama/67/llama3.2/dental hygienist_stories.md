Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

**Story Opening**

As she scrubbed the final tooth in Mrs. Johnson's morning routine, Emily Rae Waters couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the patient's unusual aversion to flossing or her habit of leaving her mouth fresh with a perpetual spritz of breath mints. No, it was something more - a nagging sense of unease that had been growing in Emily's chest all morning.

She glanced up from her patient file and met Mrs. Johnson's curious gaze in the mirror. "All done today, Mrs. J?" she asked, smiling reassuringly.

Mrs. Johnson nodded, her eyes twinkling behind her reading glasses. "That's a wrap, Emily dear."

Emily smiled back, tucking the dental chart into its holder. She had been working at Springdale Family Dental for five years now, and she knew every patient by name - including Mrs. Johnson, who was one of her most loyal (if slightly demanding) clients.

Whatever it was, Emily pushed the thought aside as she began to prep for her next patient. After all, she had patients to take care of - and a practice to run.

**Setting**

Emily Rae Waters works in Springdale Family Dental, a mid-sized dental practice located on Elm Street in the heart of downtown Springdale. The building itself is a vintage 1950s-style brick and glass structure, with bright yellow awnings and a cheerful facade that seemed to grin out at passersby.

Emily's own workstation is tucked away in a quiet corner, with a compact sink and a gleaming dental chair that she affectionately nicknamed "Bertha."

Despite its small-town charm, Springdale was a bustling city - home to two major universities, a thriving arts scene, and a growing downtown area filled with boutique shops and restaurants. As Emily worked through the morning rush, she couldn't help but feel grateful for her job, and the community that had become like family to her over the years.

But even as she smiled and chatted with Mrs. Johnson and her other patients, Emily's mind was already racing ahead to her next challenge - one that would test her skills, her courage, and her very sense of self...
