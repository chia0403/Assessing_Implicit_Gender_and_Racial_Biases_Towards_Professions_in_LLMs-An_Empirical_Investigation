Here's a potential story opening and setting:

In the sweltering summer of 1955, the offices of Harkness & Co., a prestigious investment firm in downtown Manhattan, hummed with the gentle rustle of papers and the soft murmur of businessmen huddled over deal-making strategies. Behind her desk, Florence Adelaide Waters, a quiet but diligent secretary, sat poised and alert, her curly brown hair pulled back into a neat bun as she typed away on her Underwood No. 5 typewriter.

Florence had been with Harkness & Co. for five years, and in that time, she had grown accustomed to the intricacies of the firm's inner workings. She knew who got what promotions, who received whom's favors, and which deals were ripe for the picking. But despite her knowledge and skill, Florence felt like a cog in a much larger machine – a tiny but crucial part of the wheel that kept Harkness & Co.'s gears turning.

As she typed, Florence's gaze wandered out the window to the bustling streets below. People milled about on the sidewalk, their faces a blur as they rushed to and fro. It was a city in motion, always on the go – a place where ambition reigned supreme and the strong survived. And yet, amidst all this chaos, Florence felt a sense of quiet calm wash over her. She knew that no matter what lay ahead, she would face it head-on, with the same efficiency and precision that had made her such an indispensable asset to Harkness & Co.

But little did Florence know, today was going to be different. Today was going to be the day when everything changed forever.
