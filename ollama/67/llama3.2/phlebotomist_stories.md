Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson wiped the sweat from her forehead as she gazed out at the crowded hospital room. As a phlebotomist at Mercy General Hospital, Lexi had seen her fair share of chaotic days, but today was shaping up to be one for the books.

The emergency department was in full swing, with patients pouring in by the minute and nurses scrambling to keep up with their workload. Lexi's station was cluttered with medical equipment and samples waiting to be sent off to lab for analysis. She took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for the next round of blood draws.

Just then, her supervisor, Nurse Jenkins, poked her head into the room. "Lexi, we've got a new batch of patients coming in - looks like it's going to be a long day."

Lexi nodded, already knowing that she was in for a challenge. She had always enjoyed working with blood and helping people get the medical attention they needed, but some days were definitely more trying than others.

As she waited for her first patient to arrive, Lexi's mind began to wander back to her own personal struggles. It had been six months since her diagnosis with lupus, an autoimmune disease that had sent her life into a tailspin. Her parents still lived in their small hometown, and she was starting to feel the weight of responsibility on her shoulders.

Despite the challenges ahead, Lexi took pride in being a rock for those around her - a trait that had gotten her through some tough times before. Now, as she prepared to face another day at Mercy General, she steeled herself for what lay ahead, ready to tackle whatever came her way with her trademark determination and resilience.
