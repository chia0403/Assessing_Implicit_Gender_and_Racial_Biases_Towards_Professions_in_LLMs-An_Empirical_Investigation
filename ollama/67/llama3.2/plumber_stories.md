Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the San Francisco Bay, shrouding the narrow streets of North Beach in a damp, grey mist. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted from the bakery on the corner, mingling with the acrid tang of exhaust fumes from the cars and buses that crowded the sidewalks.

Inside his shop, "McGillicuddy's Pipes," Jack Patrick McGillicuddy squinted at the stained glass window above his workbench, trying to make out the figure of a woman standing on the sidewalk outside. She was tall, with long, dark hair blown back by the wind, and a coat clutched tightly around her shoulders. Jack couldn't quite see her face, but he knew that look - it was the look of someone who had just lost something important.

As a plumber, Jack had seen his fair share of leaky faucets and clogged drains, but there was something about this woman's air of desperation that made him want to put down his wrench and help. Little did he know, his life was about to take a dramatic turn, one that would lead him from the pipes of North Beach to the very edges of San Francisco itself.
