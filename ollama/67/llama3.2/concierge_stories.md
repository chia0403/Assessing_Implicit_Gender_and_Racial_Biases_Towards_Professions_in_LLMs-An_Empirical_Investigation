Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the ocean, shrouding the streets of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist. It was a chill autumn evening, the kind that made you want to curl up with a good book and a warm cup of tea. But for Emilia Adelaide Winters, concierge at the elegant Bellvue Hotel, it was just another night on duty.

Emilia stood behind the marble front desk, her eyes scanning the lobby as she checked in guests and handed out keys. The hotel's opulent chandeliers reflected the dim light of the setting sun, casting a warm glow over the polished wooden furniture and plush carpets. But despite its elegance, the Bellvue felt stifling to Emilia at times. She was stuck in a life she didn't choose, playing hostess to the wealthy and powerful while her own desires simmered just below the surface.

As she handed a key to a young couple, Emilia's gaze drifted out the window, where the fog swirled around the grand stone fa√ßade of Ravenswood Cathedral. It was a place of dark history and whispered rumors, but also a reminder that even in this sleepy coastal town, secrets lurked just beneath the surface.

Tonight was no exception.
