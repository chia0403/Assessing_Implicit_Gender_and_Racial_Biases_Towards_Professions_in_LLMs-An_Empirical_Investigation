Here's a potential story opening:

It was a chilly autumn evening in October when Emily J. Windsor stepped out of her small office in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon, and took a deep breath of the crisp air. The streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to find warmth by the city's many coffee shops. As she gazed up at the towering trees, their leaves ablaze with vibrant hues of orange and red, Emily couldn't help but feel a sense of melancholy wash over her.

As an income tax preparer, Emily had spent countless hours huddled in front of computers, staring at spreadsheets and crunching numbers for clients. She had always been meticulous, detail-oriented, and patient – traits that had served her well in her line of work. But as the days grew shorter and the nights colder, Emily found herself feeling increasingly disconnected from the world around her.

She made her way back to her small office, a converted storefront on East Burnside Street, and pushed open the door to reveal a warm glow emanating from within. The sign above the counter read "Windsor Tax Services" in neat, block letters, and Emily felt a sense of pride knowing that she was the one responsible for helping people navigate the complex world of income tax.

As she began to sort through the paperwork and client files that had accumulated over the past week, Emily's thoughts turned to her own financial struggles. Despite her best efforts, she couldn't seem to get ahead, no matter how many hours she worked or how much she saved. The stress was starting to take a toll on her – both physically and emotionally.

Little did Emily know, this was just the beginning of a year that would change everything she thought she knew about herself, her work, and the true meaning of success.
