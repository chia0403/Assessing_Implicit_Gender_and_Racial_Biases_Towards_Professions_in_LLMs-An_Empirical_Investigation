Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. The air was thick with the scent of frankincense and myrrh, and the sound of camel bells echoed through the stillness.

Ava Sophia El-Khouri, a seasoned tour guide with a passion for history and architecture, stood at the edge of the Siq, surveying the crowds of tourists that streamed past her. She wore a crisp white robe and a warm smile, her dark hair tied back in a neat knot beneath her headscarf.

As she surveyed the scene, Ava's mind wandered to the mysterious letter she had received earlier that day. It was from an old friend, requesting a meeting at the ancient Temple of Al-Khazneh at midnight. The message was cryptic - "Come alone, and come prepared" - but Ava's curiosity was piqued.

She had spent years leading tours through Petra's winding streets and temples, sharing stories of its rich history with visitors from all over the world. But there was something about this request that felt different, something that made her feel like she was being pulled into a mystery much deeper than anything she could have imagined.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the Siq in a deep twilight, Ava took a deep breath and began to prepare for the night ahead. She had a feeling that tonight was going to be a journey she would never forget.
