The scent of stale crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia "Amy" Rosethorn. She knelt down beside the tiny LEGO tower teetering precariously on the edge of the table, its bright plastic bricks gleaming under the harsh fluorescent lights of the Sunshine Daycare Center's playroom. 

The room itself was a cacophony of colour and sound: primary-hued walls adorned with hand-painted murals, half-finished finger paintings drying on easels, and a chorus of giggles punctuated by the occasional frustrated cry. Amy loved the chaos; it was the very essence of childhood, raw and beautiful in its imperfection. 


A small voice piped up beside her, "Miss Amy, can I build it taller?"

Amy smiled down at Liam, his freckled face lit with anticipation.  "Of course you can, Liam," she said, gently adjusting a wobbly brick. "Just make sure the base is strong."

The Sunshine Daycare Center was tucked away on a quiet residential street, its cheerful yellow exterior a beacon of warmth in a sometimes-dreary city neighborhood. It wasn't fancy, but it was filled with Amy's heart and soul; she considered these children her family, their laughter her music, their tears her responsibility.
