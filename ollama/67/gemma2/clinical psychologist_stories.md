Rain lashed against the stained-glass window, casting fractured rainbows across Dr. Eleanor Vance's cluttered office. The air hung thick with the scent of old books and burnt coffee, a familiar aroma that usually soothed her. Today, though, it felt oppressive, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. 

Eleanor was renowned in the city for her gentle demeanor and uncanny ability to unravel even the most tangled neuroses. But lately, a persistent ache had settled in her own mind, a gnawing anxiety she couldn't shake. She’d been seeing more patients exhibiting symptoms of what she suspected was collective paranoia – an insidious sense of unease that manifested as distrust, suspicion, and a growing fear of the unknown. 


The latest addition to her roster, a reclusive artist named Silas Blackwood, seemed particularly troubled. He claimed his paintings were being sabotaged, haunted by unseen forces, and convinced he was being watched.  Eleanor wasn't sure if it was Silas's genuine terror or his penchant for theatricality that worried her more. 

As the clock ticked past 5 pm, Eleanor prepared to close up shop. The storm outside intensified, mimicking the growing unease within her. She glanced at a framed photograph on her desk – a picture of herself and her late husband, Ethan, their faces beaming with youthful optimism. A bittersweet pang hit her, reminding her that sometimes, even the brightest lights couldn't withstand the darkness.
