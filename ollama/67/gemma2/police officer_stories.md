The stale scent of cheap coffee clung to Detective Amelia Harper's trench coat like a persistent shadow. The fluorescent lights of the precinct hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn linoleum floor. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already-grimy cityscape outside into an impressionistic smear of grey and neon. It was 3:17 AM, a time when the city held its breath between nightmares, waiting for the sun to break and chase away the darkness.

Amelia tapped her pen against a file folder labelled "Case #2047: Missing Person - Elias Thorne." The photograph inside stared back at her â€“ a young man with kind eyes and a hesitant smile, barely out of his teens.  Disappeared two weeks ago, no trace found. Just another case in a city overflowing with them, yet something about Elias's face tugged at Amelia's gut. It was the way his smile seemed to linger even in the stillness of the photo, a promise of warmth that felt cruelly out of place in this cold, indifferent world.  

She sighed, pushing back her dark curls that had escaped their bun. Time to chase ghosts.
