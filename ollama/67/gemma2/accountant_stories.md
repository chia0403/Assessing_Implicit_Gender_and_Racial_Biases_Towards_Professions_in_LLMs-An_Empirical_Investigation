The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and nervous sweat.  His world, usually a neatly ordered grid of spreadsheets and financial reports, felt tilted on its axis. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across his desk, magnifying the frantic scribbling he was doing in a notepad. He chewed on the end of his pen, trying to decipher the cryptic message scrawled in a shaky hand: "Meet me at midnight. Bring the ledger."  

Bart glanced at the clock on his wall - 9:34 pm. His office, perched above Mrs. Gunderson's bakery on Elm Street, was usually quiet this late. The only sounds were the rhythmic whir of the vintage fan struggling against the summer heat and the distant rumble of a passing truck. But tonight, every creak of the floorboards and whisper of wind felt like a potential clue, a harbinger of something unsettling. 


He was an accountant, not a detective. He dealt in numbers, not riddles. Yet, here he was, caught in a web spun by someone who clearly knew his secrets â€“  secrets that were best left buried in the dusty annals of his ledger. The question wasn't why they wanted to meet, but what would happen when he did.
