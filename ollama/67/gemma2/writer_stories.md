The flickering neon sign outside The Rusty Quill cast an anemic glow on Alistair Finch's rain-slicked trench coat. It was the kind of London night that soaked into your bones, leaving you damp and weary. Rain lashed against the cafe windows, blurring the already hazy streetlights into watercolour smudges. Inside, the air hung thick with the aroma of burnt coffee and desperation, a familiar scent to Alistair. He hunched over his battered laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard, chasing a deadline as elusive as the mythical muse.  

Alistair wasn't writing about the dreary London night or the rain-soaked streets though. He was crafting worlds, building empires, breathing life into characters who lived and breathed in vibrant landscapes far removed from this grimy cafe. Tonight, however, his own world felt as barren as the blank page before him.
