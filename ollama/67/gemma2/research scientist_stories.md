The biting Alaskan wind whipped across Dr. Eleanor Vance's face, stinging her exposed cheeks despite the thick wool lining of her parka.  Beneath a blanket of swirling snow, the desolate landscape stretched out before her, an endless expanse of white punctuated only by the jagged peaks of the Chugach Mountains in the distance. The research station, a lonely cluster of prefab buildings huddled against the relentless storm, was little more than a beacon in this frozen wasteland.

Eleanor adjusted her goggles, her breath clouding the frigid air.  She was hunched over a makeshift drilling rig, its mechanical whine barely audible above the howling wind. Days had bled into weeks since their arrival at this remote outpost, weeks of tireless work excavating the permafrost for samples. Each core they pulled yielded tantalizing clues about the planet's ancient past, but with each passing day, the isolation gnawed at Eleanor's resolve. The silence, broken only by the groans of the wind and the crackle of the radio, felt heavier than ever.


And then there was the dream.
