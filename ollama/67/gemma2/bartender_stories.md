The stale scent of whiskey and regret hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume for Amelia "Amy" Thorne at The Rusty Mug.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a pulsating smear of red and green. Inside, the usual Wednesday night crowd shuffled around, a motley crew of weary souls seeking solace in cheap beer and even cheaper conversations. 

Amy leaned on the polished mahogany bar, her elbows resting on the damp cloth she used to wipe down mugs. She watched the regulars: Frank, hunched over his usual corner table nursing a single whiskey, his face etched with a lifetime of disappointments; Sarah, giggling hysterically with a group of friends, desperately trying to drown out the loneliness that always seemed to creep in after midnight; and old Mr. Henderson, muttering to himself about conspiracies and missing sock pairs. 

Amy knew their stories. They were woven into the very fabric of The Rusty Mug, each spilled drink and hushed conversation adding another thread to the tapestry of human experience. She didn't judge them; she just listened, offering a sympathetic nod or a wry smile when appropriate.  She was their confidante, their therapist, their anchor in a storm of everyday chaos. 


But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced down Amy's spine. The rain seemed louder, the shadows deeper, and the usual hum of conversation felt subdued, replaced by an expectant silence. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change, something big.
