The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Beatrice Prescott like a second skin as she navigated the bustling Saturday market.  Stalls overflowing with hand-painted pottery, vibrant orchids, and fresh mango smoothies lined the cobblestone streets, their aromas swirling in a chaotic symphony. Amelia, dressed in her crisp white blouse and khaki pants - the uniform of every ambitious salesperson at Sunshine Vacations - weaved through the throngs of tourists, her smile as bright and artificial as the plastic leis draped around their necks. 

Today was all about closing deals. Amelia had been given a quota â€“ ten families booked on one of Sunshine Vacations' exclusive Caribbean getaways by sunset.  Her gaze swept across the crowd, landing on a young couple inspecting a handmade conch shell necklace. This could be her first sale of the day. She adjusted her name tag - "Amelia Prescott: Your Vacation Specialist" - and began to approach, ready to weave her magic.
