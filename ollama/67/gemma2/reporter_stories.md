The humid air hung heavy in New Orleans, thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets. Rain slicked the cobblestones of the French Quarter, reflecting the neon glow of jazz clubs spilling out onto the street. Inside one such establishment, "Laissez les Bon Temps Rouler", Eleanor Beaumont tapped away at her laptop, a half-empty glass of whiskey sweating beside her.  Eleanor, a reporter for the struggling local paper, The Crescent City Chronicle, was chasing a lead on a story that could either make or break her career. It involved a series of mysterious disappearances plaguing the city's historic cemeteries - places whispered to be haunted by restless spirits and forgotten secrets. 


The rhythmic strumming of a jazz guitar and the crooning voice of a singer provided a melancholic backdrop to Eleanorâ€™s hunt for truth. The air buzzed with the energy of the French Quarter, yet she felt a chilling stillness within her own soul, a premonition that this case might lead her into darkness deeper than she ever imagined.
