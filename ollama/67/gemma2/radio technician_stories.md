The incessant whine of static crackled through Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's headphones, punctuated by the occasional bursts of garbled Morse code.  Her workshop, a converted garage on the outskirts of Dustbowl City, was a symphony of buzzing transformers, flickering neon signs, and the rhythmic clanging of her wrench against metal chassis.

Dustbowl City itself wasn't much to look at: a sprawling collection of corrugated iron shacks, rusting vehicles, and makeshift windmills struggling against the ever-present dust devils. The sky was perpetually choked with gritty haze, casting an amber glow over everything. Water was scarce, electricity even more so, and whispers of raiders prowling the desolate outskirts were a constant reminder that survival in this world wasn't guaranteed. 

Ellie, however, found solace amidst the chaos. A tinkerer at heart, she could coax life back into the most battered machines. Her reputation as "The Spark" had spread through Dustbowl City â€“ people came to her when their radios died, their generators sputtered, or they needed a simple wire mended. For Ellie, fixing things wasn't just a job, it was a connection to the world outside this desolate wasteland. A hope that one day, the static would clear and real voices would fill the airwaves once more.
