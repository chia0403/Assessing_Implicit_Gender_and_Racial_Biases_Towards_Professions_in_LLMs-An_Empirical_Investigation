The humid air hung thick in the lobby of The Grand Riviera Hotel, a monstrous edifice that seemed to absorb the entire Miami skyline. Palm trees swayed lazily outside, their fronds rustling like gossip in the relentless Florida sun.  

Behind the polished mahogany desk, Eloise Beatrice Fontaine, known simply as Ellie to regulars and "Miss Fontaine" by the new arrivals, watched the scene unfold with an practiced indifference. She'd seen it all in her 20 years at The Grand: extravagant weddings, tearful farewells, illicit affairs whispered behind silk-draped walls, and the occasional fistfight fueled by too much champagne and Cuban rum. But today felt different. A quiet unease pulsed beneath the veneer of tropical luxury.  

Ellie adjusted her crisp white uniform, the starched fabric a comforting weight against her skin. Her gaze settled on the double doors leading to the opulent ballroom. From within, a cacophony of laughter mingled with the clinking of glasses, creating a jarring discord in the otherwise serene air. A knot tightened in Ellie's stomach. Something was about to happen.  She could feel it in the way the tourists seemed subdued, their usual gaiety replaced by an anxious curiosity, and in the tense silence that had settled amongst the hotel staff. 


Ellie took a deep breath and smoothed down her perfectly coiffed auburn hair. Whatever was coming, she'd be ready. This wasn't just a job; it was her world, her domain. And Ellie Fontaine always knew what was going on, long before anyone else.
