The stale scent of crayons and forgotten lunches hung in the air like a comforting blanket as Amelia Rose Hawthorne pushed open the door to Room 204. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating rows of miniature desks meticulously arranged in the shape of a half-eaten apple â€“ a whimsical touch Ms. Hawthorne had implemented at the start of the year.  

Her third-grade class at Harmony Elementary was usually buzzing with activity by this time, but today an unsettling quietness lingered. The usual cacophony of whispered gossip and nervous giggles had been replaced by a hushed expectancy that prickled Amelia's skin like static electricity. She noticed her students huddled together in small groups, their faces drawn and pale. Even the ever-enthusiastic Timmy Johnson, who usually greeted her with a booming "Good morning, Ms. Hawthorne!" sat slumped in his seat, eyes glued to his shoes. 

Something was amiss.  


The setting is a modest elementary school, Harmony Elementary, located in a small, quiet town where everyone knows each other. It's the kind of place where kids walk or bike to school and parents volunteer at bake sales. The school itself is old but well-loved, with creaky floorboards, chipped paint, and an ever-present scent of chalk dust and disinfectant.
