The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like an agitated hive, casting a sterile white glow over the bustling emergency room.  Amelia "Amy" Grace Hawthorne, her face masked and framed by a cascade of auburn curls escaping from beneath her cap, surveyed the chaos with practiced ease. A symphony of beeps, whispers, and panicked cries filled the air, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of gurneys rolling down the corridors. 

Amy was in her element. The ER was where she thrived – amidst the urgency, the fear, the constant battle against time. It wasn't glamorous, but it was real, demanding, and ultimately rewarding.  She loved the adrenaline rush of a crisis, the satisfaction of stabilizing a patient, the quiet moments of comfort she offered to those facing their darkest hours. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the antiseptic scent that permeated every corner. A wave of exhaustion tugged at Amy's shoulders; it had been a relentless week, with double shifts and barely any sleep.  But something else was amiss, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that whispered of an impending storm.


As she prepared for the next shift change, her gaze landed on the newly arrived patient - a young woman draped in white bandages, lying pale and silent amidst the chaos. Something about her stillness, about the way her chest rose and fell with an unnatural shallowness, sent a chill down Amy's spine. This wasn’t just another case; this was something different.  Something dangerous.
