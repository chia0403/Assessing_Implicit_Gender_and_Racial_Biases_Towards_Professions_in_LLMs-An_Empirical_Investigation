The humid Georgia air clung to Coach Amelia "Amy" Rivers like a second skin as she surveyed the worn-out football field. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the already parched grass a shade of dusty gold.  She wiped her brow with a bandana, its faded blue fabric offering little relief from the heat.
