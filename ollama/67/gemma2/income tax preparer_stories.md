The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Brenda Pearl’s tiny office. Outside, the first flurries of winter were swirling down, mirroring the chaos brewing inside. She glanced at the clock – 4:57 pm. Only three minutes left before her doors officially shut for the day, but John McDougal, a man who seemed perpetually on the verge of collapse, was still mid-sentence about his “unusually high” deductible for antique spoons. Brenda sighed, her headache intensifying with each word he uttered. 

It wasn’t just John. The entire week had been a blur of frantic calls, misplaced forms, and clients convinced their tax returns were destined to be audited by some unseen tax demon. Her office, nestled in the forgotten corner of a strip mall near the edge of Elmwood, was usually a haven from the storm – a place where numbers spoke clearly and order reigned. But this year, it felt like even the calculators were rebelling.


Brenda Pearl, her nametag slightly askew above her floral-print blouse, pushed back her glasses and tried to focus on John's ramblings about his spoon collection.  "Antique spoons, Mr. McDougal? Surely, there are more pressing deductions…” she muttered under her breath, her fingers drumming a nervous rhythm on the worn wood of her desk. This wasn't how Brenda envisioned spending her evenings – surrounded by paperwork and the existential dread of tax season.
