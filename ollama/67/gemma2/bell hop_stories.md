The Grand Astoria Hotel thrummed with a low, constant hum of activity. It wasn't the roar of a bustling metropolis, but rather a symphony of hushed conversations, clattering teacups, and the rhythmic click-clack of heels on polished marble floors. The air hung thick with the scent of lilies from the lobby fountain and freshly brewed coffee wafting from the brasserie. 

Amidst this orchestrated chaos stood Bartholomew "Barty" Quillington, his bellhop uniform a navy blue beacon against the sea of expensive suits and silk dresses.  His nametag, slightly askew thanks to an earlier encounter with a particularly boisterous dachshund, read simply: "Barty." He wasn't one for grand titles or introductions; he preferred to let his actions speak for him, which, in Bartyâ€™s case, usually involved deftly maneuvering luggage carts through narrow corridors and remembering the idiosyncrasies of each guest. 


Barty scanned the lobby, his gaze settling on a woman with fiery red hair spilling out from beneath a wide-brimmed hat. She stood by the grand staircase, her frustration palpable as she struggled to hail a cab. A flash of sympathy sparked in Barty's eyes - he knew that feeling all too well. He adjusted his cap and took a deep breath, ready to dive into another day at the Grand Astoria.
