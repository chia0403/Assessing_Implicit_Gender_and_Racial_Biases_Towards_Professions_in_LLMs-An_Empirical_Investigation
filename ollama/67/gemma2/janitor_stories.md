The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Blackwood's head like a swarm of agitated bees, casting an anemic glow over the empty university library. The scent of old paper and dust hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint aroma of stale coffee from a forgotten thermos tucked away on a shelf.  Elias pushed his mop across the worn linoleum floor, its frayed edges leaving streaks in their wake. His movements were slow and deliberate, years of quiet routine etching themselves into every step. He knew every creak of the wooden floors, every dusty corner, every whispered secret held within the library's silent walls. 


Elias was invisible here. A shadow flitting through the aisles after hours, a ghost amongst the ghosts of forgotten knowledge.  He didn't mind. In the hushed stillness, surrounded by the weight of history, he found a peace that eluded him in the bustling chaos of the world outside.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up his spine, as though the library itself was holding its breath.
