The humid Louisiana air hung heavy, thick with the scent of damp earth and honeysuckle. Cicadas hummed their incessant song as sunlight streamed through the gaps in the corrugated metal roof of Silas Blackwoodâ€™s workshop. Tools lay scattered across workbenches: pliers, wire strippers, screwdrivers, all gleaming under the single bare bulb hanging precariously above. In the center, perched atop a stack of dusty blueprints, sat Silas himself, his brow furrowed as he studied a tangle of wires with the intensity of a surgeon examining an organ.  His calloused hands, stained with grease and grime, carefully untangled a frayed bundle, muttering under his breath about faulty wiring and incompetent apprentices. 

Silas Blackwood, a man who understood the language of electricity better than most understood human conversation, had a reputation in their small town of River Bend for being as reliable as the power grid itself. He could fix anything, from a flickering porch light to a malfunctioning air conditioner on the hottest day, his expertise whispered about with reverence by the townsfolk. But this job, this strange humming emanating from the old abandoned mill just outside town, was unlike anything he'd encountered before.
