The midday sun beat down on Elara Mae Blackwoodâ€™s neck like a hammer, turning her already sweat-slicked skin into an aching slab of warm flesh. She wiped it away with the back of her hand, leaving a smear of grime across her forehead.  Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by shafts of sunlight piercing through the gaps in the steel frame that was slowly taking shape above her. 

Elara squinted at the blueprint clutched in her gloved hand, trying to decipher the tangled lines and symbols that represented the next stage of their project: a new high-rise apartment building pushing its way into the heart of Seattle's ever-expanding skyline. The city sprawled around them, a chaotic tapestry of glass and steel, perpetually under construction. But this project, Elara knew, was different.  This one had whispers of grandeur, a touch of something bigger than just another concrete jungle. 

She inhaled deeply, the air thick with the scent of metal shavings, hot asphalt, and the faint tang of rain that threatened but never came in Seattle summers. This wasn't an office job for Elara.  This was her element, the roar of machinery, the grit under her fingernails, the satisfaction of seeing something real take shape from raw materials.


This was where she belonged.
