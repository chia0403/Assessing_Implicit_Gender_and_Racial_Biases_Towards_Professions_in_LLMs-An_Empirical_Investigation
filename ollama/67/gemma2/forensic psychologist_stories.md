Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her. The flickering city lights outside were smeared into blurry halos by the downpour, casting long, dancing shadows across her cluttered desk.  A half-eaten apple sat abandoned beside a file labeled "Case: Johnathan Hayes - Potential Suspect."  Eleanor ran a hand through her messy bun, exhaustion tugging at her eyelids. 

Johnathan Hayes.  Just the name sent a shiver down her spine. He was a charming charmer, with an unnervingly calm demeanor that could disarm even the most hardened detective. But beneath that facade, Eleanor sensed something cold, calculating, almost predatory. And now, after weeks of painstaking analysis, she was finally ready to confront him. 

The setting was as dreary as her mood:  a sterile interrogation room in the bowels of the city's police station. The bare walls, cracked linoleum floor, and flickering fluorescent lights did little to inspire hope or comfort. It was a place where truths were extracted, confessions given, and destinies decided. And tonight, Eleanor Vance, forensic psychologist extraordinaire, would be holding Johnathan Hayes' fate in her hands.
