The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Grace Campbell's head like disgruntled bees, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of "Bargain Bin Bonanza."  Eleanor chewed on her thumbnail, watching the clock tick by with agonizing slowness. It was a Tuesday afternoon, which usually meant the lull between lunch and dinner rush. Today, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced down Eleanor's spine, like a spiderweb skittering across her skin.

Bargain Bin Bonanza wasn't exactly known for its atmosphere of excitement. The place was crammed with dusty furniture, mismatched knick-knacks, and clothes that smelled faintly of mothballs. It attracted the bargain hunters, the curious, and the desperate. Eleanor, with her perpetually tired eyes and neatly braided brown hair, blended seamlessly into the background. She wasn't sure what it was about today, but something felt off.


The air hung heavy, thick with a silence that seemed to amplify every rustle of plastic bags and creak of the ancient floorboards. Even the usual cacophony of bargain hunters arguing over price tags and children shrieking at each other seemed absent.
