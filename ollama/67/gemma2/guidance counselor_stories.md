The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Josephine Carter’s head, casting a sterile glow over her cluttered office.  Paperclips scattered like metallic confetti across the worn wooden desk, each one a silent testament to another day spent mediating teenage angst and existential crises. Outside the small window, the Arizona sun beat down on the asphalt of the high school parking lot, baking the air thick and heavy with the scent of sunscreen and desperation. 

Amelia sighed, pushing her glasses up her nose as she glanced at the appointment list taped to her wall. Another day, another parade of anxieties: college applications, first loves, parental pressure, crippling self-doubt – the usual high school symphony of confusion and chaos. It was a demanding job, being a guidance counselor, but Amelia found a strange sort of solace in it. 

She saw herself reflected in these kids, in their yearning for purpose and belonging, in their struggle to navigate the treacherous waters of adolescence. She knew, perhaps better than anyone, that high school was just the prologue to a much longer story – a story that could be filled with both triumph and heartbreak, but ultimately, one they had the power to write themselves.
