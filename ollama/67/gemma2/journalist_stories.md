The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and exhaust fumes, a heady mix that was as much a part of Hong Kong's identity as its towering skyscrapers. Rain lashed against the windows of Mei Lin Chan's tiny apartment, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the cracked pavement below. It was the kind of storm that swallowed the city whole, turning neon-lit streets into shimmering rivers and blurring the lines between reality and a fever dream.
