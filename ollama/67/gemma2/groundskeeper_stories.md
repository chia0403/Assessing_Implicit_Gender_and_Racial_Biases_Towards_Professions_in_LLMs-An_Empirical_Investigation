The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick’s worn leather gloves as he surveyed his domain: the sprawling gardens of Blackwood Manor. Roses bloomed in hues of blush and crimson, their perfume heavy on the crisp autumn air. Butterflies, their wings frosted with dew, flitted among the hydrangeas, oblivious to Bartholomew's silent scrutiny. 

Blackwood Manor itself loomed behind him, a gothic behemoth of grey stone, its gargoyles leering down from the roofline. The manor had been in his family for generations, passed down through whispers and worn deeds. Bartholomew wasn’t sure what secrets lay within its echoing halls, but he knew every inch of the surrounding gardens – the gnarled oak where squirrels buried their treasures, the hidden well choked with ivy, the ancient rose bush said to whisper prophecies on moonlit nights. Today, however, there was something amiss. A strange scent hung in the air, a sickly sweet aroma that clashed with the familiar fragrance of roses and damp earth. Bartholomew sniffed again, his brow furrowing. It wasn't natural. He felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine, a feeling he hadn't experienced since the night the storm had ripped through the gardens, leaving behind twisted branches and shattered glass. 


What Bartholomew couldn't know was that this scent, this unnatural perfume, heralded a change far more profound than a simple autumn chill. A change that threatened not only his tranquil life amongst the flowers but the very fabric of Blackwood Manor itself.
