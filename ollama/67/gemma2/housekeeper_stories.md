The scent of lavender polish clung to Eleanor Amelia Butterfield like a second skin. She hummed softly, her fingers gliding across the antique mahogany surface of the grand piano in the drawing-room. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the tall windows, illuminating the faded grandeur of the once magnificent Belhaven Manor. Eleanor had worked here for twenty years, her life a tapestry woven from the threads of polished silver and starched linens. She knew every creak of the floorboards, every sigh of the wind through the ancient oaks in the overgrown gardens, every whispered secret held within these walls. But today, a new thread was being woven - one spun with a tremor of unease.


The manor had been strangely quiet lately, the usual bustle of the wealthy Sinclair family replaced by an unsettling stillness. Their absence coincided with the arrival of a stranger - a tall, gaunt man with eyes that seemed to hold both sadness and secrets. He occupied the west wing, shrouded in shadows and whispers.  Eleanor, ever observant, found herself drawn into the periphery of this mystery, her instincts whispering warnings she couldn't quite decipher.
