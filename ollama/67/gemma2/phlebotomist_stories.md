The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the bustling clinic.  Amelia "Amy" Brighton, her purple scrubs vibrant against the pale green walls, meticulously prepared another blood draw kit. Her movements were practiced, almost rhythmic, years of experience etched into her every gesture. A symphony of coughs and hushed whispers filled the air as patients shuffled between exam rooms and the waiting area, a chaotic ballet she'd choreographed in her mind countless times.  Outside the windows, the California sun blazed mercilessly, casting long shadows across the asphalt parking lot. Inside, Amyâ€™s world was contained within these four walls, a carefully constructed space of needles and veins, fear and relief. 

Today, however, felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up her spine, an unwelcome guest that disrupted the familiar humdrum.  Perhaps it was the way Mrs. Henderson clutched her arm like a lifeline when Amy approached her station, or maybe it was the unsettling stillness of the young boy across the room, his eyes wide and unblinking as he watched her every move. Whatever it was, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
