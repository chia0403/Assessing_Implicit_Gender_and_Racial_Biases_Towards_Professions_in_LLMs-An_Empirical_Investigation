The air was thick with the metallic tang of ozone and the acrid bite of smoke.  A crimson glow bled across the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows from the charred remains of what had once been Mrs. Peterson's bakery. The heat radiating off the smoldering ruins was enough to melt asphalt, and Captain Amelia 'Amy' Lawson could feel it singeing the back of her neck through her thick turnout gear.

She surveyed the scene, her heart a dull ache in her chest.  The bakery had been a neighborhood staple for generations, its warm cinnamon scent mingling with the laughter of children on Saturday mornings. Now, only ash and broken dreams remained. The wail of sirens still pierced the night air as Engine 42 pulled up behind Amyâ€™s unit, bringing reinforcements to this inferno that threatened to consume more than just brick and mortar.  

Amy ran a gloved hand through her sweat-dampened hair, taking a deep breath. There was no time for grief, only action. Her gaze swept across the remaining firefighters, their faces grim masks under the flickering orange light. 


"Alright team," she barked, her voice raspy but firm, "we've got hot spots in the back and possible collapse on the west wall.  Let's move!"
