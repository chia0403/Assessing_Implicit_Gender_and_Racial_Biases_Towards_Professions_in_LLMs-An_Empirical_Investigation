The neon sign outside "Rexford's Remedies" buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow on the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Rexford meticulously sorted through vials of brightly colored liquid, their labels blurred by condensation. A symphony of coughs and sniffles echoed from behind the worn, floral curtains that separated the dispensary from the waiting area. 

Amelia sighed, massaging her temples beneath her neatly pinned auburn hair. It had been a relentless week in the quaint coastal town of Saltwind, with every resident seemingly afflicted by the latest round of "Saltwind Sneezes." As she reached for a fresh bottle of decongestant, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new customer. 

The rain hammered against the shop windows as a figure stepped into the warm light, leaving a trail of seawater and sand in their wake.  Amelia straightened her spectacles, ready to greet the newcomer with her usual practiced smile. But this time, something felt different. The strangerâ€™s silhouette seemed unnaturally tall, and their features were obscured by a wide-brimmed hat that cast an ominous shadow over their face.
