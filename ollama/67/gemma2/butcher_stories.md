The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the sharp, earthy scent of sawdust.  A thin film of sweat beaded on Silas Finchwick's brow as he expertly maneuvered his cleaver through the thick slab of prime rib, muscle yielding to blade with a satisfying squelch. The butcher shop, "Finchwick's Finest," was a testament to old-world craftsmanship, its mahogany counters polished to a gleam and its walls lined with gleaming stainless steel hooks that held rows of neatly labelled carcasses.  The rhythmic clang of the cleaver against bone was the soundtrack to Silas's day, punctuated only by the occasional grunt of effort or the sharp chirps of sparrows flitting amongst the rafters. 


This wasn't just a butcher shop; it was Silas's sanctuary, his haven from the encroaching modernity that threatened to engulf their small town of Oakhaven. He took pride in every cut, every joint, knowing each piece held within it the essence of life and the promise of nourishment.  But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Silas's spine as he glanced at the worn clock hanging above the doorway - 3:07 pm. The shadows seemed to lengthen around him, and a strange chill seeped into the warm air of the shop.  It wasn't just the approaching dusk; it felt like something darker was brewing.
