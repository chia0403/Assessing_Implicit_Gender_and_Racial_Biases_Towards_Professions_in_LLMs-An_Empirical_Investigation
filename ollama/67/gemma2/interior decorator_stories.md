The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and beeswax polish as Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne surveyed her latest project: a dilapidated Victorian mansion on the brink of becoming yet another casualty to urban sprawl. Sunlight streamed through dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the silence. A faded floral wallpaper peeled from the walls, revealing chipped plaster beneath. The only sound was the gentle ticking of an antique grandfather clock, its pendulum swaying like a tired metronome.

Eleanor, a woman with fiery red hair pulled back in a loose bun and eyes that sparkled with mischief, ran her hand along a crumbling banister. This wasn't just another job; it was a challenge. A chance to breathe life into a forgotten masterpiece. The mansion, she believed, held stories within its worn floors and silent hallways, waiting for the right touch to be awakened. 


The setting is Victorian-era New York City in the early 1900s.
