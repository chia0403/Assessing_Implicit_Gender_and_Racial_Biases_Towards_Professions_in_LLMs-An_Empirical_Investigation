The air hung thick with the smell of burnt oil and gasoline as Amelia "Amy" Rose wiped grease from her brow. A single shaft of afternoon sun pierced through the grime-coated window of her garage, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. The rhythmic clang of metal against metal echoed through the space, a familiar symphony that had been the soundtrack to Amy's life for as long as she could remember. Her small, independent shop, "Rosebud Repairs," nestled on the outskirts of Rust Creek, wasn't much to look at â€“ a weather-beaten brick building with faded paint and a rusty sign hanging precariously above the door. But inside, it was a haven of mechanical magic, where Amy reigned supreme over her domain. 


She surveyed the scene: a sputtering '72 Mustang on the hoist, its engine bay exposed like an open wound; a disassembled scooter patiently awaiting its missing part; and a stack of greasy invoices threatening to topple over. It was just another Tuesday at Rosebud Repairs, where Amy's knowledge of engines ran deeper than anyone else in town, and her ability to coax life back into even the most battered machines was the stuff of legend.
