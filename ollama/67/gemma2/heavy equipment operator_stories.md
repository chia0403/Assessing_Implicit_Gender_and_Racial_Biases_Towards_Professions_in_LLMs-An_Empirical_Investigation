The sun hammered down on Beatrice "Bea" Delacroix's neck as she maneuvered the Caterpillar D9R like it was an extension of her own body. Dust swirled around the behemoth, a gritty red haze that mirrored the anger simmering in Bea's gut.  The Arizona desert stretched out before her, a canvas of cracked earth and scrub brush, punctuated by the occasional lone saguaro cactus like silent sentinels guarding secrets buried deep in the sand. 

Beaâ€™s job wasn't glamorous. It was sweat-soaked, sun-bleached work, hours spent wrestling with machines twice her size to carve paths through the unforgiving landscape for some nameless developer building another sprawling suburban sprawl.  But it was honest work. And today, Bea felt anything but honest. 


Today, she was angry.
