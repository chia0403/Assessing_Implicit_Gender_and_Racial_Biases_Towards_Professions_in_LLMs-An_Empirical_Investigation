The city hummed beneath Amelia Rose Hawthorneâ€™s penthouse balcony, a symphony of car horns, distant sirens, and the low thrum of a thousand conversations. Above it all, the moon hung like a fat pearl in the velvet sky, casting an ethereal glow on the glittering cityscape.

Amelia took a deep breath, letting the crisp night air fill her lungs. The view never failed to calm her. Even after years at the helm of Hawthorne Industries, even with its recent expansion into global markets and meteoric rise, she still found solace in this simple beauty. But tonight, the peace felt fragile, like a bubble poised on the edge of bursting.  

A text message buzzed on her phone, pulling her from her reverie. It was from her brother, Oliver. "Dinner at seven, your place." No explanation needed. He knew something was wrong. 


The setting is Amelia's penthouse balcony overlooking New York City on a clear night, with the city lights twinkling below and the moon shining brightly above. The atmosphere is tense, hinting at an impending crisis.
