The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and rosewater in "Nails of Distinction," a small salon tucked between a boisterous taco stand and a somber funeral home on Elm Street. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the colorful array of nail polishes lining the shelves like soldiers in formation. 

Eloise Beatrice Bellweather, her name as intricate and elegant as a French manicure, meticulously filed a client's nails with practiced precision. Her movements were swift and sure, a ballet of beautification punctuated by the gentle hum of the electric file. Eloise took pride in her craft, believing that a well-manicured nail could be a woman's armor, its polished surface reflecting confidence and power.

But today, Eloise felt a tremor of unease beneath her practiced calm. The usual chatter of gossip and laughter was absent, replaced by an unsettling silence.  The air itself seemed charged with anticipation, as if something momentous was about to occur. A prickle ran down her spine, whispering a warning she couldn't ignore.
