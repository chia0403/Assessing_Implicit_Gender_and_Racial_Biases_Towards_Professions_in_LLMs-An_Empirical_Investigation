The scent of cedar and sawdust clung to Elias Blackwood like a second skin. He inhaled deeply, savoring the earthy aroma that permeated his workshop, a ramshackle haven nestled on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a sleepy town cradled by the whispering pines of the Appalachian Mountains. Sunlight slanted through gaps in the corrugated tin roof, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. 

Elias ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of a half-finished rocking chair, his brow furrowed in concentration. His workshop was more than just a place to build; it was an extension of himself, a sanctuary where he poured his heart and soul into every piece he crafted. Each curve, each joint, whispered stories of meticulous care and unwavering passion. But today, Elias felt a knot of unease tightening in his chest. An order had arrived earlier that morning, one unlike any he'd received before. It demanded intricate carvings, delicate flourishes beyond his usual rustic style, pushing him into unfamiliar territory. 

He glanced at the parchment, its ink still fresh and crisp. The sender was a recluse living in a crumbling mansion on the outskirts of town, shrouded in whispers and local legend. The order, signed simply with an elegant "R," promised a hefty sum, enough to finally pay off his debts and secure his future. But something about it feltâ€¦off. Elias Blackwood prided himself on honest work, but this commission reeked of secrets, like the musty air in an abandoned attic.
