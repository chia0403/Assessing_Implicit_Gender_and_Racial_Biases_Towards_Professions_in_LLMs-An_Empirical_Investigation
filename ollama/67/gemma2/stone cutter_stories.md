The dust hung heavy in the air, a gritty fog that clung to Elias Thorne's beard and coat like a second skin. Outside his workshop, nestled between a bustling tavern and a poultice-making apothecary in the heart of Oldhaven, the cobblestones were slick with a recent rain, reflecting the flickering gaslights in a distorted shimmer. Inside, the rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel echoed through the small space, punctuated by Elias's occasional grunts as he coaxed another piece of granite into submission.  

He wasn't shaping it for a monument or a doorway this time; no grand public display. This was a personal commission, smaller and far more delicate - a simple stone heart, etched with a single name: Amelia. His knuckles were raw from the work, but his touch remained steady, guided by a deep well of grief he'd been trying to channel into something beautiful.  Each strike of the hammer was a silent vow, a promise whispered to the wind that her memory would be carved in stone, forever enduring.
