The humid Georgia air hung heavy as Elara Montgomery navigated the labyrinthine aisles of the Piggly Wiggly. Her bright yellow sundress clung to her damp skin, the polyester feeling like sandpaper against her back. She hated grocery shopping in this heat, but Mrs. Henderson, her 87-year-old client, was out of prune juice and insisted on Elara picking some up during her visit.

Elara sighed, reaching for a can of prune juice that seemed to be wobbling precariously on the shelf. It wouldn't do for Mrs. Henderson to find her out of stock, not after the whole debacle with the misplaced dentures last month. 

The Piggly Wiggly was a world away from Elara’s usual clientele – high-powered executives, tech start-ups, and wealthy families with sprawling estates.  She dealt with life insurance, disability coverage, and retirement plans. She helped people plan for the unexpected, navigate the complexities of financial safety nets. But Mrs. Henderson, with her penchant for prune juice and mismatched socks, was a reminder that sometimes, the most valuable clients weren’t the ones who could afford to throw money at problems; they were the ones who needed someone to listen, to understand their anxieties, and to hold their hand through the storm. 


Elara straightened her spine, grabbed the can of prune juice, and headed towards the checkout. She had a feeling Mrs. Henderson’s storm was brewing - something about a leaky roof and a persistent raccoon – and Elara, despite the sticky heat and overflowing grocery cart, was ready to face it head-on.
