The biting wind whipped across the obsidian sands, stinging Elara Dawnbringer's exposed skin. She pulled her worn leather cloak tighter around her, wishing for the warmth of the Great Sun that had set hours ago. The chill of the Wasteland seeped into her bones, reminding her why most folks shied away from this desolate stretch of land. But Elara, a seasoned guard in the Obsidian Order, wasn't most folks. 

Her post was a rickety watchtower perched precariously on the edge of a crumbling cliff face, overlooking a vast expanse of shimmering black sand that stretched as far as the eye could see. A thin ribbon of dust painted a faint trail across the horizon, the only sign of life in this barren landscape.  It was a stark contrast to the bustling city of Emberfall, nestled amongst the few patches of green that dared to sprout amidst the desolation. 

Elara shifted her weight, the rough leather creaking against her armor. A tremor ran through the tower, causing a loose stone to clatter precariously from the wall. She squinted into the gloom, her hand instinctively reaching for the hilt of her blade. The Wasteland was unforgiving, and silence here often meant danger lurking just beyond the pale moonlight.  


This desolate landscape held its secrets close, and Elara, despite years of service, never felt truly safe. The whispers of forgotten gods and legends of monstrous creatures that stalked the night kept her ever vigilant. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of her neck told her she wasn't alone.
