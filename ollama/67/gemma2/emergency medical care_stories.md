The incessant wail of sirens sliced through Amelia Grace Hawthorne's otherwise quiet morning. She was still bleary-eyed, the remnants of sleep clinging to her like cobwebs, when her phone buzzed with an incoming call. "Hawthorne unit 2 responding," she mumbled into the receiver, already scrambling out of bed.

Amelia lived in a world bathed in the stark blue and red of emergency lights. A paramedic for six years, she was used to chaos being her constant companion. The city of Nova City was a sprawling beast, teeming with life and danger in equal measure. Its towering skyscrapers cast long shadows over the bustling streets below, where sleek hovercars zipped between pedestrians, their engines humming like anxious bees. 

This morning, the call came from Sector 7, a notorious part of town known for its gritty underbelly and labyrinthine alleyways.  Amelia's heart quickened with the familiar adrenaline rush. She slipped into her uniform – crisp white jacket emblazoned with the city's medical emblem, sturdy boots laced tight, and her trusty medkit strapped across her chest – a warrior preparing to face the unknown. As she raced through the labyrinthine corridors of the Nova City Med Center, Amelia knew one thing for sure: another shift in Sector 7 was about to begin.
