The humid Georgia air hung heavy in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' nostrils as he wrestled a rusted pipe out from under the dilapidated sink. Sweat beaded on his forehead, tracing paths through the grime that clung to his face like a second skin. He swore softly, the echo bouncing off the damp walls of Mrs. Clementine's cramped bathroom. The air was thick with the scent of mildew and lavender disinfectant, a peculiar combination that never quite sat right with Bart.

Mrs. Clementine, a frail woman who spoke in hushed tones and smelled perpetually of mothballs, peered at him from behind her cracked reading glasses.  "Are you sure it's fixable, Bartholomew?" she asked, her voice trembling like an old harpsichord. "This plumbing has been giving me trouble for years."

Bart wiped his brow with a grimy rag, the cotton ball sticking to his sweat-soaked skin. He glanced at the pipe in his hand – a twisted, rusted relic from a bygone era. 

"Ma'am," he said, offering her a weary smile, "If it ain't broken, I don't know how to fix it."

Bart Higgins, a struggling plumber trying to make ends meet in the post-war era, finds himself dealing with more than just leaky pipes –  he stumbles into a mystery that threatens to unravel the secrets hidden within the walls of Mrs. Clementine's ancient home.
