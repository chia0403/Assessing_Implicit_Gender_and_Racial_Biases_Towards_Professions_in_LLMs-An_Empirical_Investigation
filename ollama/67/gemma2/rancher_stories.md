The sun, already high in the unforgiving Montana sky, beat down on Elias Jedediah Thorne's neck as he surveyed his land. The once vibrant green pastures were now bleached bone-colored under the relentless summer heat. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mocking the skeletal remains of last year's corn stalks. This wasn’t how it was supposed to be. Not for Thorne Ranch, not in its 100th year. Elias wiped his brow with a calloused hand, the grit under his fingernails a testament to years of honest labor. He could feel the worry gnawing at him, the kind that settled deep in your gut and refused to budge.  

The drought had been unforgiving, stretching on for months with no sign of rain. The cattle were restless, their usually placid eyes now filled with a desperate hunger. Elias knew he was running out of time. Every day, the waterhole shrunk, the grass withered, and his hope dwindled. He needed rain, desperately, or Thorne Ranch wouldn’t survive this year. 


The setting:  A sprawling ranch in south-central Montana, during a brutal drought. The vast plains are parched and dusty, the cattle gaunt, and the farmhouse stands lonely and weary under the relentless sun.
