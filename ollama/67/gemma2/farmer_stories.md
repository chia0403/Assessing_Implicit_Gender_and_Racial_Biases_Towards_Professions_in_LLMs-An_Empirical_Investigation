The rooster's crow was barely audible above the insistent drumming of rain on the tin roof. Elara Thistlewick, her face creased with years spent squinting at the sun, stirred in her bed. Dawn hadn't quite broken over the rolling hills of Alderwood Valley, but the storm had passed through with a ferocity that left its mark on everything. 

Elara pulled on her thick woolen trousers and boots, careful to avoid the mud pooling around the worn wooden floorboards. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a smell she found oddly comforting after months of relentless summer heat. Stepping outside, Elara inhaled deeply, feeling the chill wind whip through her grey hair. Her small farm, nestled in the valley's curve, lay shrouded in mist, each apple tree and pumpkin patch a blurry silhouette against the backdrop of storm-grey clouds. The river that ran along the propertyâ€™s edge was swollen and brown, carrying debris from the hills upstream. It was a sight both beautiful and unsettling, a reminder of nature's untamed power.  Elara knew she had work to do, but for now, she stood there, watching the first rays of sunlight struggle through the swirling mist, a sense of quiet determination settling over her.
