The air crackled with static as Captain Amelia "Ace" Everly gripped the controls of her battered X-wing fighter, its aging frame groaning under the strain of atmospheric re-entry.  Below her, the planet Kythera sprawled like a bruise on the horizon - a swirling tapestry of ochre sands and emerald forests, marred by the scars of recent conflict. 

Ace's cockpit was cramped and cluttered, maps spread across the dashboard beside a battered mug of cold caf. The smell of ozone hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of her own sweat.  She adjusted the comms, her voice crisp despite the tension that gnawed at her insides. "Base to Ace, this is Eagle One. Approaching landing zone Alpha."

Static hissed in response before a gruff voice crackled back, "Roger that, Eagle One. Expect heavy traffic. Watch out for civilian evac shuttles." 


Ace swore under her breath. This was going to be messy.
