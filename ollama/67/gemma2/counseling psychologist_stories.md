Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest brewing within her own chest.  She stared out at the blurred cityscape, its usual symphony of honking horns and distant sirens now muffled by the downpour. 

Eleanor’s small practice nestled on a quiet side street in Beacon Hill, Boston, was usually a sanctuary – a haven from the chaos of city life. But today, it felt suffocating. A knot of anxiety tightened with every gust of wind that rattled the window frames.  Her phone sat silent beside her, uncharacteristically still. It wasn't just the weather; she had an unsettling feeling something was amiss. 


Eleanor ran a hand through her short, auburn hair, trying to quell the growing unease. Her first appointment of the day, Mr. Alistair Finch, a long-time client struggling with PTSD, was late.  He was usually punctual, his anxiety manifesting in an almost comical obsession with timekeeping. This tardiness felt different, out of sync with the predictable rhythm of his life.

Eleanor sighed, pushing away the encroaching sense of dread.  She needed to focus. She couldn't let her own anxieties overshadow her professional responsibilities. Perhaps Mr. Finch had simply gotten caught in the storm. 


But as she glanced at the clock again, its hands ticking inexorably forward, a chill ran down her spine. This wasn’t just a delay. Something was wrong.
