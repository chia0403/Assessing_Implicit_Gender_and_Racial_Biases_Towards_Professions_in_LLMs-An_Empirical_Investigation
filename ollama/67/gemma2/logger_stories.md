The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A symphony of birdsong filled the morning, punctuated by the rhythmic thunk of Caleb Ethan Blackwood's axe against ancient Douglas fir. Sunlight dripped through the towering canopy, dappling the forest floor in emerald patches. It was a scene both beautiful and brutal, this dance between nature's majesty and man's relentless pursuit of progress.

Caleb, his calloused hands gripping the worn handle of his axe, surveyed the clearing he had painstakingly carved out of the wilderness. Each fallen giant, stripped of its bark and limbed with practiced ease, was a testament to his skill and strength. Yet, a gnawing unease lingered beneath the familiar rhythm of his work. The forest seemed different this time, more watchful, as if the ancient trees themselves were whispering secrets in the wind. 


Caleb wasn't sure what troubled him. It could be the unsettling stillness that had settled over the wildlife, or the strange markings he’d found carved into the bark of a particularly old oak.  But whatever it was, it felt like a premonition, a warning whispered on the edge of his awareness. He just didn’t know what it meant.
