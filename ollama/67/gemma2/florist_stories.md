The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, clung to Elara Rosethorn's hair like an unwelcome perfume. It wasn't that she disliked lilies – they were classic, elegant, a staple in any respectable florist shop – but after a week straight of funeral arrangements, their fragrance had become a constant reminder of death's ever-present shadow.

Elara ran a hand over the velvety petals of a crimson rose, trying to banish the melancholic mood that seemed to have settled over "Rosethorn's Blooms." Her tiny shop, nestled on a cobbled street in the heart of Alderwick, was usually bustling with life and laughter: bouquets for birthdays, declarations of love, or simply a dash of colour to brighten someone's day.  Today, however, the air hung heavy with silence, broken only by the rhythmic click-clack of Elara's shears as she pruned the drooping stems of a wilting hydrangea. 

Alderwick itself was a town caught between tradition and modernity. The centuries-old stone buildings, adorned with ivy and blooming geraniums, whispered tales of a forgotten era, while the occasional flash of neon from a new tech shop hinted at the relentless march of progress. It was this unique blend of old and new that Elara loved most about her town, but even the vibrant hues of her flower displays couldn't seem to pierce the gloom that had settled over Alderwick in the past few days.
