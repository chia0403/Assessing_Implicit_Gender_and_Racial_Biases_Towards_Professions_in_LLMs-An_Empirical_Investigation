The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thompson, casting a sterile glow on the rows of gleaming instruments.  She adjusted her mask, the thin material doing little to muffle the metallic tang that always lingered in the air. The familiar whirring of the suction machine and the low murmur of Dr. Patel’s instructions were a soothing symphony to Amelia's ears. This was her domain: the dental chair, a battlefield where plaque was vanquished and cavities conquered. 

It was Wednesday morning, the busiest time at Smile City Dental. A steady stream of patients shuffled through the doors, their faces etched with varying degrees of apprehension about the day’s procedures. Amelia greeted each one with a warm smile, her own white uniform a reassuring beacon of professionalism amidst the anxieties that often accompanied a trip to the dentist. 


But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unusual energy, a sense of anticipation that had nothing to do with molar maintenance or root canals.  Amelia couldn’t quite place it, but she knew that this ordinary Wednesday morning in Smile City Dental was about to become anything but ordinary.
