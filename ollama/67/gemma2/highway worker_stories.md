The sun beat down on Elias Bartholomew's neck, sweat already plastering his faded orange work shirt to his back. The asphalt stretched before him like a shimmering, endless ribbon, warped by the heat that pulsed off it.  Dust devils danced in the distance, whipped up by the occasional truck thundering past on Highway 17, a lifeline cutting through the desolate expanse of Nevada desert. Elias squinted, trying to focus on the seemingly straight line he was tasked with mending â€“ a crack snaking its way down the road's surface, threatening to become a gaping maw for unwary drivers.  

He wiped his brow with the back of his grimy hand, grimacing at the grit that now felt like sandpaper against his skin. The silence was broken only by the distant hum of engines and the incessant chirping of crickets, a chorus mocking his solitude. This stretch of highway, miles from any town or civilization, felt more like the edge of the world than a vital artery connecting communities.
