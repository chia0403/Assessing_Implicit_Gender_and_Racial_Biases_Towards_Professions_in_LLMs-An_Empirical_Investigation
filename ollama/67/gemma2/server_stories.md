The steam from the sizzling fajitas danced in the dim light of 'Abuelita's Fiesta,' swirling around Esmeralda Reyes like a miniature tempest. The scent of cumin, chili powder, and sizzling onions hung heavy in the air, mingling with the clinking of glasses and the low murmur of conversation. It was Friday night, prime time at Abuelita’s, and Esmeralda, a whirlwind of red lipstick and crisp white uniform, darted between tables like a hummingbird, balancing plates precariously on her hip while juggling orders like they were magic tricks.  

Abuelita's Fiesta wasn't just another restaurant; it was a heartbeat in the bustling heart of barrio San Miguel. It pulsed with laughter, stories, and the aroma of family recipes passed down through generations. Esmeralda, who had been serving tables here since she was sixteen, knew every corner, every booth, every whispered secret shared under the twinkling fairy lights strung across the ceiling. 


This night, though, felt different. A prickle of anticipation ran down Esmeralda’s spine as a new face entered the restaurant, a lone figure in a sharp suit, his eyes scanning the room with an air of quiet curiosity.  He was looking right at her.
