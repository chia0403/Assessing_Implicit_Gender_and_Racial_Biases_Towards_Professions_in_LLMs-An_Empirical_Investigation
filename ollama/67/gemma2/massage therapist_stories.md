The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that often felt more suffocating than soothing to Elara Skye Thorne. Elara ran a gloved hand across the worn surface of the teak table, her thumb tracing the grooves where countless knots had been kneaded out over the years. The "Tranquility Massage Parlour" wasn't exactly living up to its name today. 

The midday sun beat down on the quaint Victorian building in sleepy Oakhaven, casting long shadows across the overgrown rose bushes lining the porch. A lone hummingbird hovered at a dusty feeder, its tiny wings a blur as it darted between crimson blossoms. The usual gentle hum of cicadas was replaced by the rhythmic whirring of a chainsaw from somewhere down the street, a jarring counterpoint to Elara's usually peaceful sanctuary.

She glanced at the clock on the wall: 12:47 pm. Her next appointment wasn't until 3, leaving her with an unnerving amount of time to contemplate the stack of overdue bills on her desk and the gnawing anxiety in her gut. Maybe it was just another Tuesday in Oakhaven, a town where even the air seemed stagnant and resistant to change. Or maybe something else was brewing beneath the surface of this seemingly placid afternoon. Elara wasn't sure, but she had a feeling that things were about to get interesting.
