The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of saltwater and decaying fish as Drina "Dee" Alvarez navigated the creaky wooden dock.  Evening was settling over Avalon Harbor like a shroud, painting the sky in hues of lavender and bruised plum. The distant sound of seagulls calling echoed through the stillness, punctuated by the occasional rumble of a barge passing by on the choppy waters.  This was Dee's haven - this island town where time seemed to have stopped, its pace dictated by the rhythm of the tide. 

Dee wasn't meant for the hustle and bustle of the mainland. She’d fled the concrete jungle years ago when she realized her real calling lay in caring for others, a desire that had led her to become a physician assistant at Dr. Davies’ modest clinic on Avalon Island.  As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the harbor, Dee began her night rounds - a ritual both familiar and comforting.
