The salt spray stung Amelia Thorne's eyes as she watched the ferry depart, carrying her last client across the swirling Atlantic. It was another "trip of a lifetime" - this time to the remote fishing village of Port-au-Ré on the French Riviera.  Amelia had poured over countless travel brochures and online reviews, meticulously crafting each itinerary detail for her clients. She felt the familiar pang of nostalgia, watching the sun dip below the horizon, turning the sea into liquid gold. 

For years, she’d dreamt of trading in her cramped office for a beach bungalow in Port-au-Ré, but reality held her back: too many unsent emails, unfinished projects, and an overactive phone line constantly buzzing with inquiries from desperate travelers yearning for their next adventure. Amelia was known as "The Adventure Architect" - and she thrived on the challenge of turning abstract desires into concrete journeys.  But tonight, a nagging feeling settled in her gut, a sense that maybe it wasn’t all sunshine and croissants after all. 

She stared out at the churning sea, its waves whispering secrets only the ocean knew, secrets about what was truly missing from her life - a peace she hadn't found even in the heart of the most exotic travel destinations. Amelia had helped countless people find themselves on their travels but now felt lost in the labyrinthine corners of her own life.  The world seemed to be spinning faster and faster, leaving her stranded at the edge of it all.
