The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile, almost sickly glow over the cramped office at 10th Street Insurance. Dust motes danced in the air, swirling like miniature galaxies around Amelia "Amy" Thorne's worn-out coffee mug. It was Wednesday, and she was drowning in claims; the past two months had been a whirlwind of leaky roofs, exploding ovens (thankfully not involving pies), and a particularly stubborn parrot who refused to settle its "bird flu" policy.  

Amy sighed, her gaze drifting towards the city's skyline through the window. Above, skyscrapers rose like steel giants against the bruised purple sky. Below, a symphony of honking horns and frustrated sighs from pedestrians punctuated the late morning rush hour.  This was Chicago – a sprawling metropolis where dreams took flight on the backs of wind-blown hopes, yet also where desperation clung to the edges like an unwanted undercurrent in the city's veins. 

Today, however, Amy found herself staring into the abyss - an empty office chair facing a sea of unanswered calls and neglected files. A new policyholder was demanding answers, another one was on hold because his “antique clock had suddenly fallen apart” (apparently it counted as "personal belongings" for insurance), and she was starting to wonder if this city was going to swallow her whole.
