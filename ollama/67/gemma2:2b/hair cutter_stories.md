The air in "Snips & Spangles" was thick with the scent of rosemary shampoo and old dreams.  Bartholomew "Bart" Quillman meticulously straightened a client's unruly fringe while humming along to the '60s music blasting through the speakers. The shop was tucked away on a cobblestone street, its faded floral awning providing shade from the late afternoon sun. Outside, pigeons pecked at discarded bread crumbs on a cracked stone path, their cooing echoing the gentle whirring of the hair dryer next to Bart. He loved this corner of town; it held memories both bittersweet and comforting. The years he'd spent here had seen countless transformations: haircuts for high schoolers with nervous grins, first dates turned celebratory, funerals where grief was laid bare and washed away by tears.  Bart wasn't just a hair cutter; he was a keeper of stories.
