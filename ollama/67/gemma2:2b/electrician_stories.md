## The Flicker

**Setting:**  A dilapidated Victorian mansion perched atop a windswept cliff overlooking the turbulent Atlantic. Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, each droplet echoing the frantic thrumming in Elias Thorne's chest. 

**Character:** Elias Thorne, a man of weathered hands and a quiet stoicism, had been called to this decaying monument by his late grandmother's will. For years he’d worked as an electrician, fixing lights and rewiring nightmares for wealthy clients with far too much time on their hands.  But the mansion held a different kind of darkness, one that clung to its creaking floorboards and stained-glass murals like cobwebs.

**Opening:** "The last thing I expected was a ghost," Elias muttered, his voice barely audible above the howling wind. He surveyed the grand ballroom, its once opulent grandeur now overshadowed by dust motes dancing in the fading light.  A single flickering lamp cast grotesque shadows on the peeling wallpaper, each one twisting into monstrous figures that seemed to writhe and scream under his very gaze. Elias had always been a pragmatic man, but the mansion's air felt charged with something far more potent than electricity – an ancient sorrow that throbbed in the silence like a wounded heart.
