The salt-laced wind whipped Elara’s auburn hair across her face as she stood atop the Watchtower, the granite surface slick with rain. Below, the harbor of Port Nova pulsed with life – fishing boats bobbing like restless spirits, merchants haggling in loud voices over brightly colored silks, and the ceaseless clang of hammer against metal echoing from the shipyard a stone’s throw away.  Night had just begun to paint the sky in hues of plum and violet when Elara’s gaze swept across the harbor's expanse. It was her duty, after all, to be vigilant – to watch for danger, to ensure the safety of Port Nova's people. She adjusted the worn leather strap of her pouch where she kept her father's prized signet ring - a symbol not just of duty but of his unwavering belief in her ability, even when others doubted. 

Elara was known as "Silverhand" amongst the guards, an apt nickname given her uncanny knack for tracking down those who slipped through the shadows like wraiths.  Her years of training under the legendary Captain Thorne had honed her senses to razor-sharp edges, and she relished the challenge - every shadow held a potential threat, and every whisper could be a warning.  But tonight, the quiet hum of Port Nova felt different – a gnawing unease settled in Elara’s gut like a pebble dropped into a still pond.  The air itself seemed charged with an underlying tension.
