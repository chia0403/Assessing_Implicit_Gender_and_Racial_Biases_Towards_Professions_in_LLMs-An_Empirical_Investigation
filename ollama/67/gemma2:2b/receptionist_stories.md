## The Receptionist's Lament

**Setting:**  A cramped office tucked away in the back alley of an old Victorian building on Bleecker Street. 

Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, creating a symphony of patter and groan. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Thornton, barely visible behind the overflowing coffee-stained desk piled high with paperwork, chewed on her thumbnail, eyes glued to the flickering fluorescent light. The air was thick with the scent of old paper, stale cigarettes, and something vaguely metallic - likely from the faulty heating system that seemed determined to forever remain a testament to neglect. 

Amy, a woman weathered by years spent juggling office stress and the occasional broken coffee machine meltdown, had become synonymous with this tiny oasis of chaos.  For her, every day was an act of defiance against the relentless march of time and the ever-increasing weight of expectations thrust upon her like unwanted presents.
