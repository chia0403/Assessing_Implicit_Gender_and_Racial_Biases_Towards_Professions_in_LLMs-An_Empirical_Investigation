The salty air whipped Amelia Croft's auburn hair around her face as she surveyed the bustling beachside market.  She loved this time of year – summer solstice in Seaside Haven, a small coastal town where life felt slower, sunnier, and infused with an almost tangible energy. But today, the usual serenity was replaced by a frantic buzz of activity. The air itself seemed to crackle with a hidden tension Amelia couldn't place. 

Amelia was no stranger to the weight of expectations – she was renowned nutritionist, author of "Unlocking Your Inner Radiant", and her practice had been packed ever since word about her latest invention - the "Soulful Sustenance" supplement, spread like wildfire through social media influencers and health-conscious blogs. The supplement promised to unlock one's true vitality using a blend of ancient herbs and modern bioenergetic technology.

It was this very product that was now causing Amelia unease. Her usually calming aura felt strained as she watched the line of customers – a mix of nervous families, excited teenagers, and even some hardened-looking individuals in their late 50s - eagerly awaiting their turn at her "Soulful Sustenance" station. What started as a hopeful launch had descended into something… discordant.  

There was an undercurrent of worry running through the crowd – a collective anxiety that seemed to radiate off Amelia's own energy field. It wasn't fear, exactly, but a sense of foreboding, like the ocean before a storm.
