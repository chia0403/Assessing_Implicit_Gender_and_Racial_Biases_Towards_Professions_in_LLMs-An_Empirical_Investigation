The midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt, baking the air thick and heavy like syrup. Dust devils danced in the distance, their ephemeral forms mirroring the ever-shifting landscape of Route 66 itself.  At the wheel of his rig, Jebediah "Jeb" Harper felt a familiar ache in his shoulders as he navigated the endless ribbons of highway. He'd spent most of his life on these roads, their monotonous rhythm both a comfort and a torment to him, like an old song stuck on repeat.

Jebâ€™s rig, 'The Rusty Mule', was more than just a vehicle; it was his lifeline, his confidant, and sometimes, even his escape hatch. The worn leather seats held the weight of countless miles and untold stories, each crease and scuff a testament to Jeb's journey.  As he lumbered through the Arizona desert, a lone coyote howled in the distance, its cry echoing across the vast emptiness. It was another day on the open road for Jeb, another mile closer to somewhere... yet nowhere specific.
