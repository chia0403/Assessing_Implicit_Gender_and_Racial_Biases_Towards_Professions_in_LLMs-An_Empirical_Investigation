The scent of stale pipe tobacco and expensive perfume hung thick in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of disinfectant that seemed to cling to everything like cobwebs. This was room 214 at The Grand Elysium Hotel, and it was August, which meant high humidity and a perpetual feeling of being trapped. Or maybe it was just the oppressive atmosphere created by the incessant hum of the ancient elevator motor, its slow, creaking rhythm echoing down endless corridors.  This is where Reginald "Reggie" Bartholomew Bellhop III found himself, his polished shoes clicking against the worn floorboards as he shuffled through room after room, a small, invisible universe unfolding around him. 

The Grand Elysium was an old dame, her grandeur fading like sunlight on dusty windowpanes. The lobby, with its faded velvet curtains and chipped marble floors, was once a sight that made tourists gasp in awe. Now, it only served as a backdrop for the city's relentless march towards progress â€“ or so Reggie felt. He sighed, adjusting his crisp white uniform collar, a tiny rebellion against the monotony of the day.

Reggie wasn't just any bellhop.  He was a dreamer trapped behind a worn-out smile and an endless list of tasks: making sure Mr. Fitzwilliam's prized orchids didn't wilt in the stifling heat, finding missing luggage that smelled suspiciously like pastrami sandwiches, and always anticipating the inevitable - his next encounter with the perpetually grumpy old man from room 101. It was a life he lived each day with quiet resignation, but a flicker of hope remained: maybe one day, he'd find something more than just another lost suitcase.
