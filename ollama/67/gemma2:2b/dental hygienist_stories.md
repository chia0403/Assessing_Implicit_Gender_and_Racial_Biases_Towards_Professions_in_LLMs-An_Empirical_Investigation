## The Setting: 

The air hung thick with the scent of chlorine and antiseptic in Dr. Anya Petrova's small, cozy office in Astoria, Queens.  A mosaic tile mural depicting a smiling sun on top of a rainbow, painstakingly crafted by her late grandmother, adorned one wall. It was a far cry from the sterile, impersonal clinics Anya had witnessed during her time as a dental hygienist in Chicago. Here, amidst the familiar chaos of scraping plaque and polishing teeth, she felt a sense of peace, a tangible connection to her past that helped ground her amidst the sometimes-stressful world of dentistry.

## The Story Opening: 

Anya Petrova adjusted the soft blue scrubs, trying to quell the nervous flutter in her stomach. It was only a routine check-up for Mrs. Delacroix, a sweet old lady who had been her patient since Anya first started practicing in Astoria. But something felt different today. A knot of anxiety tightened in her chest. The news about Mr. Garcia's recent passing, the man whose smile sheâ€™d once cleaned so meticulously, still echoed in her mind. 

A wave of melancholy washed over her as Mrs. Delacroix, oblivious to Anya's internal storm, settled into the chair, humming softly to herself. A small bouquet of forget-me-nots rested on the table beside her.
