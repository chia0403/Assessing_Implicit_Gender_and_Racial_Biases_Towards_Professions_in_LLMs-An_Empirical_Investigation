Rain lashed against the windshield of Amelia "Amy" Hayes' pickup, blurring the already dim streetlights into a dizzying kaleidoscope.  The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and ozone as she navigated the slick asphalt, the flashing red lights of her ambulance cutting through the growing darkness like a beacon in the storm. This wasn't her usual stomping ground – this rural stretch of Highway 68 usually boasted only windmills and farmhouses, but tonight it felt alive with the pulse of something far wilder, darker. 

Amy, a seasoned emergency medical technician, had seen it all during her years on the road: from teenage suicides to sudden strokes, from car crashes to freak animal attacks. But this – this was different. There was a weight hanging in the air, a palpable sense of fear that seemed to vibrate off the metal walls of the hospital's back entrance.  

The night was still young, but the sky had turned a menacing shade of purple as she parked near the hospital's emergency room doors. Her medical bag slung over her shoulder, Amy took a deep breath, hoping this storm would pass without turning into something much, much worse. 


**Setting:** A small rural town in Indiana, during a heavy thunderstorm and a seemingly endless stretch of highway between towns.

**Character:**  Amelia "Amy" Hayes, Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) known for her calm demeanor and quick thinking under pressure.
