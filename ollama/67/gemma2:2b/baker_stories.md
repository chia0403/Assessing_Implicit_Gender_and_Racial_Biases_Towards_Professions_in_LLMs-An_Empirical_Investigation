The morning mist clung to the cobblestone streets like a damp shroud, muffling the usual clamor of the market square. Even the sun seemed reluctant to pierce the heavy veil above, its rays struggling to ignite the gray stones and paint the storefronts in hues of rose and plum.  Inside "Sugar Bloom," Eleanor's heart mirrored the muted light. She surveyed her pastries, the delicate sugar flowers on top of each croquembouche wilting under a layer of mist-touched air.  

Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, known to all as Ellie, was the last baker in the village. The others had succumbed to the allure of the city's bustling pastry shops and the promise of fortune.

Ellie was a baker through and through, but lately, even she felt the weight of tradition against the tide of change, whispering that perhaps her own shop was just another relic from a time gone by.
