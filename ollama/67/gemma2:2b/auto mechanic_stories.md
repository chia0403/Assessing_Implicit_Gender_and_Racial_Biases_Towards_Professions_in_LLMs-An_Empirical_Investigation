The smell of burnt oil clung to every surface in "Old Faithful" Garage like a second skin.  Inside, amidst the clanking of wrenches and the whirring of drills, sat Ethan Blackwood, his face weathered by years spent under the hood of countless cars.  He was known throughout town as the mechanic who could fix anything, from a sputtering lawnmower to a vintage Mustang's heart attack engine. Tonight, however, Ethan found himself wrestling with a problem far beyond the usual oil changes and spark plugs – he was trying to decipher a cryptic note left on his workbench, one that seemed written in a code only he understood. 

The note read: **"Five minutes after the last eclipse, turn left at the old oak tree, the answer lies where the river meets the sky."** It wasn’t signed, just a series of carefully scrawled letters and symbols, a puzzle box of words that whispered secrets he didn't know how to decipher. The note was accompanied by a worn-out map etched with an arrow pointing towards a seemingly deserted part of town. Ethan's heart pounded in his chest, a mixture of excitement and dread swirling together like the oil he dealt with every day. 
**Setting:** A rundown but beloved garage nestled in the heart of a small, coastal town, surrounded by friendly faces and a history stretching back several generations. The air hangs heavy with the scent of motor grease, fuel, and old memories.
