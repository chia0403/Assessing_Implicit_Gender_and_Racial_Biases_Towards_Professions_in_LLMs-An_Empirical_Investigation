## The Setting:

**Name:**  The "Lavender Loft" - A small, charming salon nestled in a quiet corner of Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood. 

Sunlight slanted through stained-glass windows, casting a mosaic of colors across the polished wooden floor and worn leather chairs. An aroma of lavender polish lingered in the air, battling with the scent of fresh citrus from the lemon peels on the shelf next to the sink. 

**Opening:**

"Another Tuesday," Evelyn muttered as she smoothed down her apron, the crisp white fabric a stark contrast against the chaotic scene unfolding around her.  A symphony of nails clicking against acrylic trays and clippers slicing through cuticle skin punctuated the quiet murmurings of gossip exchanged between clients. Her name, etched onto the salon's antique mirror, read "Evelyn Sterling," but Evelyn knew that this wasn't just a name. It was a lifeblood, a pulse in the rhythm of her existence. 

She glanced at the clock on the wall â€“ 3:15 pm. The next appointment was an hour away, and the silence that followed the previous client's departure filled her with an unsettling stillness.  "Something's not right," she murmured to herself, a knot forming in her stomach. The usual calm of the salon felt off today. There was something unsettling about the quiet hum, as if a storm was brewing on the horizon but no one dared speak its name. Evelyn took a deep breath and began polishing her tools, the rhythmic click-clack echoing through the empty space, an attempt to find normalcy in the chaos she so carefully maintained.  But even with the familiar routine, something felt amiss - like stepping into a dream you knew was already fading.
