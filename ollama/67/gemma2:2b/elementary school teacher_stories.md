## Story Opening

**Setting:** A quaint, tree-lined street in Maplewood, California, home to Mrs. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's lively third-grade class at Oakview Elementary School. The sun hangs low in the sky, casting long shadows from the swaying oaks lining the street, their leaves painted with autumn hues of crimson and gold. 

**Character:**  Mrs. Amy Hawthorne.  A woman with a laugh like wind chimes and eyes that sparkle with boundless energy. She's been teaching third-grade for twenty years at Oakview, and her classroom overflows with brightly colored artwork, whimsical fairy houses in the corner, and the comforting aroma of homemade cookies from her weekly baking sessions. But this year, something is different. A sense of unease hangs heavy in the air, not unlike the impending storm brewing on the horizon.


**Opening:** 

“Alright class,” Mrs. Hawthorne announced with a cheerful grin as she swept her fingers through the air, stirring up a swirling vortex of chalk dust in her palm. "We're diving into our favorite topic today: the history of storms!" Her voice echoed throughout the room filled with students buzzing excitedly about the prospect of learning more about their weather wonders. But Mrs. Hawthorne noticed something different this morning – a storm cloud hung heavy over the classroom, not just in the metaphorical sense but perhaps literally too. She couldn’t shake off a feeling of foreboding as she glanced at the door where a lone figure stood watching them with unnerving intensity.  


The silence was broken by her own whispered question: "What could possibly be causing...this?"
