Rain lashed against Elias Thorne’s worn cabin windows, each drop drumming like an insistent heartbeat against the wood. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of cedarwood and pine needles, remnants of a day spent battling the elements in the heart of the Redwood Forest. Elias, his broad shoulders hunched over a steaming mug of coffee, stared out at the dense green canopy that swallowed the last sliver of daylight.  

He was known as "Old Thorns" by the locals, a nickname earned from the way he’d wrestled with every inch of the forest for nearly half a century. Elias had grown up amidst the towering trees, their silent presence an ancient companion throughout his life. Now, after years of toiling under their watchful gaze, he knew them better than he knew himself. 

The storm was raging as usual - a full-blown tempest that threatened to unleash its fury on the forest floor with howling winds and torrential rain. But Elias wasn't fazed.  He had faced down every challenge this land threw at him: the unforgiving terrain, the suffocating humidity, and even his own demons. He was accustomed to the rhythm of nature’s relentless march. And tonight, he was determined to keep it moving, just as it always had.
