The air hung heavy with sawdust and the scent of freshly-planed oak as Elias Cartersson worked his magic on the ancient loom he had inherited from his grandfather. The late afternoon sun slanted through the workshop windows, painting his weathered face in long shadows that danced like phantoms. He'd known these shadows forever, ever since he was a boy chasing after them, pretending to be a knight of the lumberyard. Now, they were as familiar and comforting as the feel of wood beneath his calloused fingertips. 

Elias’s small workshop nestled behind the main street in Verden - a town where time seemed to move at its own pace, dictated by the rhythms of life. The streets were lined with quaint homes and shops, their windows glowing with warmth and light, a stark contrast to Elias’s workshop's dimly lit interior. He was a solitary craftsman, his only companions the whispers of wood against wood and the occasional creak of the loom as he worked. 

Elias had always found solace in the slow, patient work of shaping wood into beautiful things, be it the sturdy frame for a house or the intricately carved furniture that brought joy to his customers' homes. But lately, a strange restlessness had settled within him. The silence was growing heavier, and the familiar comfort of his craft felt somehow inadequate.
