The air hung thick and humid in the cramped cubicle, heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Rain pattered relentlessly against the dusty window, its rhythm mirroring the frantic taps of Amelia "Amy" Thorne's fingers on her aging calculator.  It was 3:47 pm and she hadn’t even had a decent conversation with a customer in the last two hours. The “Sales Blitz” they promised at the start of the month felt like a cruel joke now, each passing day etching another line of worry onto Amy's forehead.  

She adjusted her floral-print blouse nervously - its bright hue was a stark contrast to the dreary atmosphere inside the "Tech Haven" electronics store in downtown Reno.  The clientele here was as uninspired as their selection of clunky laptops and outdated tablets: middle-aged retirees, bored college students, and families desperately trying to navigate online learning tools for their kids – none of whom seemed particularly willing to shell out a hefty sum for new tech they'd barely understand. 

Amy’s boss, Mr. Henderson, always said the key to sales was empathy.  But with each passing customer leaving empty-handed, Amy felt more like a robot, her gears grinding in frustration, and the hope that she could make it through this month - or even just another hour - was dwindling faster than the battery life of their most recent models.
