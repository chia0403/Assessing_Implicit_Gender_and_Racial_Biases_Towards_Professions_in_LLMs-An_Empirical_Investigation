## Setting:

**Time:**  Early morning in rural Vermont.  The air hangs thick with damp earth and the scent of woodsmoke from nearby chimneys. 
**Location:** A quaint corner pharmacy named "Smith & Sons" tucked away on Main Street in the town of Havenwood, population a mere 500 souls. The building itself is a testament to generations: its facade boasts faded paint, the wooden door creaks when opened, and inside, shelves line the walls stacked with colorful glass bottles and worn-down apothecary jars.  

## Character:


**Name:** Amelia "Amy" Winthrop
**Age:** 28 
**Profession:** Pharmacist for Smith & Sons, a family business that has been her life since she graduated pharmacy school at age 25. She is deeply embedded in the fabric of Havenwood and its people.  


## Story Opening:


The first rays of dawn pierced through the dusty windowpane, bathing Amelia Winthrop's face in a golden glow.  With each gentle ripple of light against her worn-out flannel shirt, she felt another year slip away from her life's long list of responsibilities. Another day, another stack of prescriptions to decipher, another wave of weary faces looking for relief from their ailments. Yet, Amy couldn't help but admire the quiet beauty of it all - the way the sun cast a warm glow over the dusty glass jars and the familiar creaking of the old pharmacy doors. 


This was Havenwood.  Amy had grown up here, surrounded by its small-town life:  from Mrs. Peabody's daily complaints about her aching knees to Mr. Johnson's persistent cough, she knew the routines and troubles of each resident. But today, there was a different kind of tension in the air. The usual hushed hum of prescriptions dispensed, and whispered conversations over medication reminders, felt replaced by an undercurrent of unease that throbbed through Amy like a low-frequency hum. 


 A man, his face shadowed by a wide brimmed hat, entered the pharmacy, stopping abruptly before her. His weathered eyes held a sadness she had rarely encountered outside of Mrs. Peabody's daily gloom.  His presence filled the room with an inexplicable chill, and a question began to form in Amy's mind - Was this another tale from Havenwood's silent history, or was it something more unsettling? 


  "Can I help you?" she asked, her voice hesitant as she looked at the man. His eyes flickered towards the worn-out pharmacy jars.
