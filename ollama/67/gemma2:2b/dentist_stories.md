The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and citrus, swirling in an endless dance around Dr. Amelia Cartwright's office.  Neon signs outside buzzed their usual fluorescent hum, casting harsh shadows across the worn linoleum floor as the clock on her reception desk ticked past 5:30. The waiting room was a kaleidoscope of mismatched chairs, posters depicting healthy smiles with varying degrees of forced cheerfulness, and a battered family photo album propped precariously against a chipped bookshelf. Amelia sighed, adjusting her white coat over her scrubs. It wasn’t unusual to have the odd silence before the first patient arrived; she preferred it this way, allowing for a moment of contemplation in the mundane routine of her life. 

Except today, there was no silence. Only a pounding thrumming from outside, the kind you get when something's deeply wrong, like a broken heart or a dropped wrench. The rhythmic knocking against her door started slow, then picked up speed as if fueled by a storm brewing on its own. It wasn’t her usual patient who was late; this was different - a strange urgency in the way it seemed to come at her from every corner of the room, as if the very walls themselves were whispering an urgent plea.
