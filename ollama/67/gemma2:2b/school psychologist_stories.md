Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia "Amy" West's office, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in her chest. Outside, the storm raged - a familiar symphony for someone living in Seattle during its infamous "October gloom."  Yet, inside, the air was thick with an almost tangible tension. 

Amelia, or as some students whispered, "Amy the Whisperer" due to her uncanny ability to read them like an open book, adjusted her spectacles and took a deep breath, hoping to calm the storm brewing within her own mind. The file on her desk lay stark against the muted grey of the room, its contents more unsettling than a rainy Seattle afternoon. It was Ethan Hayes, the 14-year-old transfer student struggling with anxiety, whose erratic behavior had become an unwelcome headache for both him and his teachers.  

Ethan's case wasn't just about behavioral challenges; it delved into a deeper, more unsettling reality - one that Amelia felt seep in through the cracks of her professional façade and threaten to consume her.  The storm outside mirrored the turmoil within her – each gust of wind bringing with it a new wave of anxieties about Ethan's well-being and how she was going to help him navigate this treacherous ocean of emotions.
