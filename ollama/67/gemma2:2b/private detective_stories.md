The rain hammered against Detective Alistair Thorne's trench coat like tiny fists against steel.  He squinted down at the flickering neon sign outside the 'Lucky Star Diner,' its cheerful promise of warmth and comfort seeming a world away. It was past midnight, and the air hung thick with the scent of exhaust and damp concrete. The only sound besides the relentless rain came from the crackling radio in his car, static filling the silence between news reports about a series of seemingly random burglaries plaguing the city. 

Alistair Thorne wasn't your typical gumshoe. A former soldier who saw too much of the world for comfort, he'd traded the battlefields for a life solving mundane mysteries, or so he thought. Truth be told, his latest case was beginning to feel anything but ordinary. The victim, a local art collector named Mr. Fitzwilliam, had been found dead in his mansion with only a single, priceless emerald necklace missing from his opulent vault.  Alistair adjusted the fedora pulled low over his eyes and muttered under his breath, "More like an unscripted heist." He sighed.  It was just another Tuesday night for a private detective named Alistair Thorne.
