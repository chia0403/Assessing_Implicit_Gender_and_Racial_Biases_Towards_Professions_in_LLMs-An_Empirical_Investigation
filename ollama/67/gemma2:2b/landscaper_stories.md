The morning mist clung to the valley like a shy ghost, blurring the already vibrant green meadows into hazy silhouettes.  A chill wind rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree that dominated the small clearing where Ethan "Hawkeye" Miller knelt, meticulously weeding between the rows of lavender that stretched across his property like a purple sea. It was a job he'd taken pride in for decades â€“ tending to his family's land after inheriting it from his grandfather, who'd been a legendary landscaper himself.  The air held the sweet scent of ripe apricots and freshly cut grass, a comforting symphony that only Hawkeye truly knew how to orchestrate.

Today, however, was different. A gnawing unease settled upon him, like a persistent shadow. The usual symphony seemed off-key, punctuated by unsettling whispers in his head: "They're coming," they hissed, "Soon." 


**Setting:**  A secluded, family-owned estate nestled within the rolling hills of rural Vermont.
**Character:** Ethan "Hawkeye" Miller, a man of quiet strength and weathered hands, who finds solace and purpose in landscaping.
