The air in the Grand Blackwood Library hung thick with the scent of aged paper and forgotten dreams. Dust motes danced in the shafts of afternoon light that filtered through stained glass depicting fantastical creatures, their colors muted by the years. Here, amidst the towering shelves packed with history's whispered secrets, resided Elara Sterling, a woman whose quiet grace was as familiar to the library's worn tomes as her own name.

Elara had always felt most at home in this sanctuary of knowledge, surrounded by stories whispering from their pages. She moved through the stacks like a ghost, knowing the murmurs of forgotten centuries and the rustling secrets whispered by aged parchment. But today, a new unease stirred within Elara's normally calm spirit. The library's usual serenity was shattered by the arrival of a stranger, his shadow falling across the ancient floorboards with an unnerving quietness.
