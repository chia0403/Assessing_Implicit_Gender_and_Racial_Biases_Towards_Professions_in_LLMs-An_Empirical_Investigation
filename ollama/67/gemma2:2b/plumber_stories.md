Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, each drop exploding into tiny bursts of water on the already-saturated glass.  Inside his cramped, greasy workshop, nestled amongst the detritus of countless drain jobs - rusted pipe clamps, overflowing buckets, and stacks of chipped blueprints – sat Bartholomew "Bart" Thompson. 

His calloused fingers tightened around the worn leather handle of a wrench as he surveyed the overflowing gutter outside. A symphony of downpours continued to play its relentless melody, each drop a tiny drumbeat against the corrugated tin roof above his shop. Bart wasn't one for fancy phrases or flowery metaphors, but even he had to admit that this weather was giving him a headache.

He needed a break.  A real one. Not just another round of fixing leaky pipes and battling stubborn clogs – though those were hardly novelties in the life of a plumber. 
Bart sighed. He could already feel the familiar ache behind his eyes, a chronic pain that came with working under pressure, literally, in this unforgiving city's labyrinthine plumbing network. It was time for something different. A long-awaited escape - perhaps even a little indulgence.  "A night of peace and quiet," he muttered, before a grin spread across his face as an idea sparked like a small flame in the rain-drenched workshop. 


**Setting:** An old brick-and-mortar repair shop nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter. The air is thick with the scent of old pipes and mildew. Outside, the relentless rhythm of the Louisiana rain underscores the symphony of drips and gurgles within Bart's cramped workshop, where a lifetime of plumbing problems have been solved one wrench at a time. 

**Character:** Bartholomew "Bart" Thompson - A seasoned plumber with years of experience under his belt, whose stubborn nature and unmatched knowledge of pipes has earned him a reputation as the go-to guy for any plumbing issue. 


Now, what will Bart do to escape this storm?
