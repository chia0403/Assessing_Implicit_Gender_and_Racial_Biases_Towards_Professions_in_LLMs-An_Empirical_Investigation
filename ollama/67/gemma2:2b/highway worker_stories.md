## The Crack in the Sky

The air hung heavy with the scent of asphalt and diesel fumes as Silas "Slick" Harding surveyed his latest construction project – an ambitious widening of I-80 through the heart of Montana. He ran a calloused thumb over the faded, red stripes on his work gloves, the kind he'd worn for fifteen years. They were stained with oil, sweat, and the dust of countless miles driven across this unforgiving landscape. 

It was dusk, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and crimson as Silas pulled out his thermos of lukewarm coffee. He took a swig, its bitter taste clinging to his throat, a familiar sensation that mirrored the weariness he felt sinking into him like concrete.  The construction crew had been working for days, battling the unforgiving Montana wind and scorching sun, their spirits waning under the relentless pressure of completing the project by tomorrow's deadline.

Silas sighed, looking up at the sky. The sun was about to dip below the jagged peaks, leaving behind a sliver of twilight that reflected in the endless expanse of steel beams and concrete. But something else caught his eye – a crack, faint but disturbingly evident, running through the otherwise pristine surface of the newly laid asphalt. It didn't look like any other fault line; this was more like a fissure splitting open the very fabric of reality. 

Silas lowered his thermos, his heart thrumming in his chest. This wasn’t just an ordinary crack; it felt...wrong. As if something hidden beneath the surface was waking up, stirring, and threatening to break free. And Silas knew, with a certainty that chilled him to the bone, this was no ordinary event. Something extraordinary was about to happen.
