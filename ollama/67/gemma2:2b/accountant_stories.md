Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Harold Finch's office like tiny fists pounding on glass. The air inside was thick with the aroma of old paper and stale coffee, a familiar scent to anyone spending their days buried within the labyrinthine world of spreadsheets. Harold, known affectionately by his colleagues as "H-man" for his meticulous accounting skills, looked up from the tangle of numbers before him, a storm brewing not just outside but in his own soul. 

The office clock ticked past noon, each second echoing the mounting anxiety pressing down on Harold's chest like a lead weight. For years he’d meticulously maintained the books for “Finch & Sons,” a family-run business that seemed to be crumbling under the pressure of an impending lawsuit from a disgruntled former employee. Every number, every invoice, every penny accounted for was being scrutinized in court. And with every passing hour, Harold felt his carefully constructed world tilting at its edges. 


**Setting:**  A small, dimly lit office within a bustling downtown area. The building itself is a testament to the city's relentless growth - steel and glass reflecting the gray sky through decades of neglect.
