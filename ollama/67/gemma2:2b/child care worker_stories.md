Rain hammered against the windows of Sunshine Cottage, turning the usually cheerful facade into a blurry kaleidoscope of grey. Inside, Elara Evans, her bright yellow cardigan practically glowing in the dim light filtering through the storm clouds, carefully arranged the scattered toys strewn across the carpet floor.  At ten years old, Elara was small for her age but possessed an uncanny ability to manage even the most chaotic of playrooms. She loved the quiet hum of chaos: it was her symphony, her music. 

Sunshine Cottage housed a motley crew of children: three rambunctious toddlers with boundless energy and a mischievous streak; two wide-eyed six-year-olds whose imaginations ran wild; and finally, young Thomas, an eight-year-old brimming with quiet intensity who seemed to disappear into the pages of his books, leaving only a faint scent of cinnamon and forgotten adventure in his wake.
