## The Drawing Room

The air hung thick with anticipation in the cramped drawing room, even thicker than usual after Mrs. Hemmings had poured another cup of chamomile tea.  Evelyn Thorne's gloved fingers tightened around her scalpel, its sterile steel a stark contrast to the worn wood and faded floral wallpaper that decorated the room. This wasn't your typical clinic setting; this was a historic estate on the outskirts of the city, filled with whispers of forgotten scandals and secrets buried beneath years of dust and silence. 

Evelyn was an anomaly in this world: a woman whose talent for drawing blood was just as precise as she was comfortable in her tailored blue uniform. Her name was whispered with reverence among both patients and staff, but only because there were some who thought it best not to even speak the name of the "Blood Weaver" – their own unspoken fear of her abilities giving way to a grudging respect.

Evelyn's eyes scanned the room; she had grown accustomed to the intricate details: the faded tapestry depicting the 'Daughters of Venus', the chipped porcelain dolls lined against the wall, and the heavy velvet curtains that were always drawn, hiding a secret behind their luxurious fabric. The air was thick with the scent of lavender, hinting at a past filled with delicate rituals and unspoken promises. 

Her patient today was Mrs. Hemmings' son, Bartholomew, a boy as shy and introverted as they come.  He had been troubled by a persistent illness that plagued his youth, and his mother's insistence on using the 'old ways' for healing – a combination of herbs and rituals - only seemed to worsen his condition. This time, she hoped Evelyn could offer more than just an old wives' tale.
