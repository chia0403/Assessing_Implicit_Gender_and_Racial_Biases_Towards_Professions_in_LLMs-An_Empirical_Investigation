The air hung thick with humidity, each breath heavy in Amelia's chest as she navigated the crowded hallway outside Mrs. Henderson's room.  "Morning, Amelia," chirped Ms. Peterson, her cheerful voice bouncing off the walls of the bustling hospital. "Mrs. Henderson's having a bit of a flair-up this morning." 

Amelia sighed, already feeling a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. Mrs. Henderson was notoriously stubborn, and her recent flare-up of rheumatoid arthritis had left Amelia battling for any semblance of mobility - or even an acceptable level of composure. "I know, Ms. Peterson," she replied, trying to sound as calm as the sea breeze that promised a much-needed ocean trip later in the day.

The setting: Harmony Ridge Hospital - a sprawling facility nestled within a small coastal town where Amelia felt oddly at home amidst the bustling chaos and endless waves crashing against the rocky shore. It was her haven; a place she'd been hired for a year after graduating from the prestigious Physical Therapy program at UCLA. She loved working with patients, helping them regain their independence and joy.
