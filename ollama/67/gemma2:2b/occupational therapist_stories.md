## Setting:

**The bustling heart of New York City's Upper East Side.**  A mix of gleaming glass and opulent brownstones line the streets, but tucked away in a quiet corner is a haven of sunshine and calm - **"Rebound Rehab,"** a small office dedicated to helping people reclaim their lives through therapy. The air hummed with the soft clatter of rehabilitation tools, gentle music playing from an antique record player, and the rhythmic click-clack of keyboard clicks. 

## Character:

**Amelia "Amy" Carter**, her name echoing through the bustling city, is a vibrant Occupational Therapist whose warmth and genuine care radiate from every interaction.  With years under her belt, she's seen it all - strokes left patients struggling to brush their hair, childhood trauma leaving young adults hesitant to interact, and everyday routines becoming overwhelming for seniors. 


## Story Opening:

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as Amy surveyed her makeshift office. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating the carefully organized shelves overflowing with specialized equipment. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves outside, swirling a kaleidoscope of color across the worn wooden floors. She smiled, knowing this space, despite its humble beginnings, was a sanctuary for those who needed it most. Today's new patient, Mr. Miller, a retired businessman from an affluent family on Park Avenue, sat nervously in a chair she had hand-crafted herself. He clutched a tattered copy of "The Little Prince," his eyes filled with a mixture of hope and apprehension. 

“Mr. Miller,” Amy began, her voice warm and inviting. “How are you today?”
 
Her kind smile softened the sharp edges of his anxiety.  He swallowed hard, his lips pulling back in a hesitant grimace. "I... I just don't know what to do anymore." he whispered, his voice cracking with fatigue. "Everything feels so… out of reach.”


 
This is where Amy’s journey begins - helping Mr. Miller regain his independence and reclaim his life.  The story unfolds as she navigates the complexities of physical rehabilitation, emotional challenges, and the unwavering resilience of a man who still holds onto the dreams of a simpler time.
