The humid air clung to Dr. Evelyn Sterling like a second skin as she stepped off the Greyhound bus in rural Idaho.  Even after years spent practicing in bustling Chicago, nothing prepared her for the vastness of this landscape, the silence broken only by the cawing crows and the whooshing wind through the tall pine trees.  Her office was in a converted cabin on the edge of town, surrounded by an overgrown garden teeming with wildflowers, just like the one sheâ€™d pictured in the brochure that had been plastered across every inch of her dreams.

But dreams were starting to crumble under the weight of reality. 

Evelyn hadn't expected much resistance from the small town of Willow Creek - after all, she was here for a reason: to offer her expertise to the only clinic accepting new patients in this desolate corner of America.  She had hoped to ease the minds of the residents, help them navigate their emotional struggles. But what she found instead was a suffocating sense of isolation and the lingering shadow of grief, as if the town itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to break. 

The weight of those burdens landed on Evelyn's shoulders like a physical manifestation of her patient's anxieties.  She could feel it in every breath she took, every step she made towards the cabin that held so much promise and fear. Tonight, she needed more than just chamomile tea and silence.  Evelyn needed something to ground her, to remind her why she had even chosen this desolate patch of earth. 

Her name was etched on a worn wooden sign outside the cottage, its paint peeling like a sunburnt skin: **Evelyn Sterling, Clinical Psychologist.** It felt somehow ironic - like she was trapped in a scene from one of her patients' worst nightmares.  And yet, there it hung, a reminder that somewhere deep within this seemingly empty space, lay an opportunity.
