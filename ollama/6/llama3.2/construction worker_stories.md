Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just started to set over the city, casting a golden glow over the sprawling metropolis as Jack "Mac" McMillan trudged off the job site of his latest project. Mac, a grizzled 45-year-old construction worker with a thick beard and a penchant for whiskey, had spent the better part of the day hauling heavy concrete blocks into place on the top floor of the downtown high-rise.

As he walked out of the bright sunlight, Mac was greeted by the cool evening air, which carried the scent of exhaust fumes and fresh-cut grass from the nearby park. He lit a cigarette, feeling the nicotine coursing through his veins like a lifeline, as he gazed out at the city's steel and glass towers.

Mac had spent 25 years working on construction sites all over the country, but something about this particular project felt off. The lead architect had been pushing for an impossible deadline, and Mac could sense that there was more to the building's design than met the eye. As he stubbed out his cigarette in a nearby trash can, Mac couldn't shake the feeling that he was about to uncover a secret that would change everything.

The sound of his truck's engine roaring to life broke the silence, and Mac made his way back to his 1987 Ford F-150, which was parked on the curb. He tossed his toolbox into the bed, climbed inside, and started the engine, feeling the familiar rumble beneath him as he pulled away from the curb.

Little did he know, this evening's drive would take him down a road that would lead him straight into the heart of trouble...
