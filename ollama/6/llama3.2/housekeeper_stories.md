Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The small, coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea was bathed in the warm, golden light of early morning as Emma Alexandra Wellington made her way through the quiet streets. As she pushed her wheelbarrow filled with cleaning supplies down Elm Street, the salty sea air filled her lungs and the sound of seagulls carried on the breeze. It was a peaceful start to another day of work at the prestigious Bellvue Manor, the grand estate that had been in Emma's family for generations.

As a housekeeper, Emma took pride in keeping the manor spotless and running smoothly, but it wasn't just the dusty antiques and faded portraits that kept her on her toes – it was the eccentricities of the family themselves. Mrs. Bellvue, the owner of the manor, was known for her sharp tongue and high expectations, while her son, James, seemed to be perpetually lost in his own world of books and science.

Despite the challenges, Emma had grown to love the rhythms of life at Bellvue Manor, and she felt a sense of belonging among the old stone walls and the secrets they kept. But on this particular morning, as she turned onto the driveway that led to the manor's grand entrance, Emma couldn't shake the feeling that something was off – a sense of unease that lingered in the air like the scent of last night's dinner.
