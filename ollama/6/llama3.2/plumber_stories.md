Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood Cove in a damp, grey mist. It was a typical winter morning in this quirky little community, where the seaweed-scented air clung to skin like a damp shroud.

In a cramped, single-room office above his plumbing shop on Main Street, Jack Elliotson sipped a lukewarm cup of coffee and stared out at the rain-soaked streets below. His shop, "Elliotson's Pipes," had been family-owned for generations, and Jack was determined to keep it running smoothly, even as the world outside seemed to be slipping further into chaos.

At 42, Jack was a seasoned plumber with more gray hairs than he cared to admit. He'd spent years fixing leaky faucets and unclogging drains for Ravenswood Cove's eccentric residents – from fishermen who swore their nets were cursed to the quirky owner of the local bakery, who insisted her pastry dough was sentient.

As he scanned the morning news on his old computer, Jack's gaze landed on a notice from the town council about a mysterious water main break in the nearby woods. The repair crew had been called out at 3 AM, but so far, they'd found nothing. No signs of damage, no leaks – just an eerie feeling that something was off.

With a sinking sense of foreboding, Jack set his coffee cup down and began to mentally prepare himself for a day of plumbing, pipe-fitting, and possibly – who knew? – supernatural mystery-solving.
