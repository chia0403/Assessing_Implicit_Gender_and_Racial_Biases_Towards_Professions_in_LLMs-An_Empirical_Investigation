Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood City glistened like polished glass as Radio Technician First Class, Elliot Victor Thompson Jr., splashed through the puddles on his way to work. It was 4:45 AM on a drizzly Wednesday morning, and the city's commuters were still shrouded in darkness.
