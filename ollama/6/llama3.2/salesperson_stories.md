Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Asher Elijah Thompson stepped out of his sleek, silver sedan and onto the worn asphalt of Pike Place Market. The smell of freshly caught salmon and roasting coffee beans wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of conversation and the clinking of glassware from the bustling crowd.

Asher, a seasoned salesperson with a sharp mind and quick wit, had been tasked by his boss to close the deal of a lifetime: securing a lucrative contract with a prominent tech firm that was rumored to be in need of a top-tier talent like himself. The meeting, however, had been pushed back at the last minute due to a severe storm warning, leaving Asher feeling frazzled and out of sorts.

As he gazed up at the iconic Space Needle, now shrouded in a veil of rain-laden mist, Asher couldn't help but wonder if this chance encounter with his old friend, Rachel Lee, who owned a trendy boutique nearby, might just be the break he needed to turn his fortunes around. Little did he know that fate had other plans...

In this opening, I've introduced:

* The main character, Asher Elijah Thompson, a salesperson with a sharp mind and quick wit.
* The setting, Seattle's Pike Place Market, which is known for its vibrant atmosphere, fresh produce, and bustling crowd.
* The time of day: late afternoon, perhaps just before the storm warning kicks in, adding to the sense of urgency and unease.
* A hint at Asher's personal life: his old friend Rachel Lee, who owns a boutique nearby, suggesting that there may be more to Asher's story than meets the eye.
