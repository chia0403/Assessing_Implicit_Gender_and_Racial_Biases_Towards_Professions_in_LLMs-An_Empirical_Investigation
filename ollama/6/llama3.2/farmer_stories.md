Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the rolling hills of Willow Creek Farm, casting a warm orange glow over the fields and barns as Evelyn Mae Wilson made her way back to the farmhouse after a long day of harvesting the last of the summer crops. The air was filled with the sweet scent of ripe corn and the sound of crickets provided a soothing background hum as she walked.

Evelyn had spent her entire life working on this farm, learning the ins and outs of sustainable farming practices from her father, who had learned them from his own father before him. She took pride in growing the most delicious and nutritious produce in the county, and her customers loved her for it.

As she approached the farmhouse, Evelyn noticed that something was off. The barn door was open, and a piece of paper was fluttering in the breeze, caught on a nail near the entrance. Curious, Evelyn walked closer to investigate, and as she picked up the paper, she saw that it was a letter, addressed to her.

"Dear Evelyn Mae," the letter read. "I'm writing to inform you that the bank has foreclosed on your farm due to outstanding debts. You have 30 days to vacate the property. Sincerely, The Bank of Willow Creek."
