Here's a potential story opening:

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Tidal Cove, nestled in the heart of Oregon's Pacific coastline. Tidal Cove was known for its rugged beauty, with towering cliffs, hidden coves, and a bustling harbor where fishermen brought in their daily catch.

**Main Character:**

Meet Evelyn Mae Waters, a 35-year-old insurance agent who had traded the hustle and bustle of Portland for the quiet charm of Tidal Cove. A native Oregonian, Evelyn grew up playing on the beach and listening to her grandfather's tales of the sea. She had always been drawn to the world of insurance, fascinated by the intricate dance of risk and reward that underpinned every policy. With her warm smile, quick wit, and unwavering determination, Evelyn was well-respected in Tidal Cove for her ability to navigate even the most complex claims.

**Story Opening:**

Evelyn Mae Waters stood on the edge of the beach, watching as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the waves. It was just another day in Tidal Cove, where everyone knew each other's stories and secrets. Evelyn had always felt at home here, but lately, she'd been feeling restless. A sense of unease had settled in her stomach like a rock, refusing to be shaken off.

As she breathed in the salty air, Evelyn's mind turned to the phone call she'd received that morning from the Tidal Cove Police Department. They wanted to speak with her about an old claim â€“ one that was still open, despite being filed years ago. The memory of the conversation lingered in her mind like a whisper: "Evelyn Mae Waters, we need your expertise on this one."

With a sense of foreboding, Evelyn turned and walked back towards her office, wondering what secrets the past might hold for her small town.
