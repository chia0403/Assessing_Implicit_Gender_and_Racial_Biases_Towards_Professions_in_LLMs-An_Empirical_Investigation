As the last wisps of autumn's chill dissipated from the small town of Oakdale, Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the school parking lot, gazing out at the sea of parked cars and the imposing fa√ßade of Oakdale High School before her. The once-vibrant leaves had long since given way to the drab tones of winter, but Lexi's mind was still reeling from the events of that fateful Friday morning.

Lexi, a school psychologist with a kind heart and an unwavering dedication to her students, had spent countless hours trying to unravel the tangled threads of a particularly complex case. It started when Sarah Jenkins, a quiet and reserved freshman, had begun exhibiting increasingly erratic behavior in class - whispering cryptic messages to herself during lectures, scribbling anxious notes on scraps of paper, and avoiding eye contact with even her closest friends.

As Lexi delved deeper into the mystery, she uncovered a web of secrets and lies that seemed to be woven from the very fabric of Oakdale High itself. The air was thick with tension, and the students' once-peaceful chatter had given way to an undercurrent of fear and unease.

Now, as she stood at the threshold of another day, Lexi felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. Something didn't feel right. She took a deep breath, shouldering her bag and steeling herself for the long day ahead. Little did she know that today would be the day everything changed forever.
