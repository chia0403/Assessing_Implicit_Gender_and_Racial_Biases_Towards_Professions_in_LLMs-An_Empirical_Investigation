Here's a potential story opening and setting for a mystery or thriller:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Judge Adelaide Victoria Wellesley stepped out of her high-rise office building and onto the sidewalk. She pulled her dark grey trench coat tighter around her shoulders, feeling the familiar chill of the Pacific Northwest wind whip through her curly brown hair.

As she walked towards the ferry terminal, the sleek grey hulls of the ferries glinting in the dim light, Adelaide's mind was preoccupied with the upcoming trial that would soon consume every waking moment. The case against Victor LaGrange, a wealthy tech mogul accused of embezzlement and tax evasion, had all the hallmarks of a classic high-stakes game: millions at stake, reputations on the line, and a web of secrets waiting to be unraveled.

Adelaide, with her sharp intellect and years of experience on the bench, was one of the most respected judges in Washington State. But beneath her composed exterior, she harbored a secret: a personal connection to Victor LaGrange that threatened to compromise her impartiality. As she boarded the ferry and took her seat among the commuters, Adelaide couldn't shake the feeling that this trial would be more than just another day at the office â€“ it would be a reckoning with her own demons.
