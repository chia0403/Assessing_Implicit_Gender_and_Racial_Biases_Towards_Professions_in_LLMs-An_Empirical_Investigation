Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the harbor, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, gray mist that clung to every surface like a damp shroud. Inside the old stone building that housed the Ravenswood Public Library, Emilia Rose Harrington stirred the ashes of the fire that had burned down to embers overnight. She had always loved the way the library's wooden shelves seemed to stretch up to the ceiling like sentinels, guarding ancient tomes and dusty scrolls.

As she poured a fresh cup of coffee from the pot she'd made before dawn, Emilia gazed out the window at the fog-soaked streets below. It was a chill autumn morning, the kind that made you want to curl up with a good book and a warm cup of tea. But today wasn't like any other day in Ravenswood.

A letter had arrived at the library earlier that week, addressed to Emilia personally. The envelope was old-fashioned and ornate, with a wax seal bearing the crest of a family she'd never heard of: the Blackwoods. According to the letter, Archibald Blackwood had passed away, leaving behind a vast collection of rare books and manuscripts that he wanted Emilia to inherit.

Emilia raised an eyebrow as she took her first sip of coffee. She was a librarian, not some kind of collector or antiquarian. But there was something about the letter's words that resonated deep within her: "The Blackwoods have been waiting for you, Emilia Rose Harrington."
