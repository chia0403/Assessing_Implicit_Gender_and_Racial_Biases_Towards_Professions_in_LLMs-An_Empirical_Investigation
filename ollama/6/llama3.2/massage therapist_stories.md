Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint Main Street. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted from the local bakery, mingling with the sound of laughter and chatter from the outdoor caf√© patrons.

In a cozy building just off the main street, Aurora "Rory" Thompson was preparing for another busy evening at her massage therapy practice, Serenity Massage. Rory had spent years honing her craft, earning a reputation as one of the most skilled and intuitive massage therapists in town. Her calm demeanor and soothing touch made even the most skeptical clients feel at ease.

As she lit the essential oils and settled into her chair, Rory's mind began to wander to the unusual request she had received that morning from a new client named Emily. Emily was a stressed-out young professional who claimed to have experienced a strange series of events that had left her feeling anxious and disconnected from her body. Rory was intrigued by the prospect of helping Emily untangle the knots in her mind and body, but she couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this client than met the eye.

Little did Rory know, Emily's visit would be just the beginning of a journey that would take her down a rabbit hole of secrets, lies, and mysterious forces beyond her wildest imagination.
