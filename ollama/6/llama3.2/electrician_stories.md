Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the docks, shrouding the small town of Ravenswood in a damp, gray mist. It was a familiar sight for Jack Sebastian Reynolds, a ruggedly handsome electrician with a no-nonsense attitude and a knack for fixing just about anything that didn't work anymore.

Jack stood on the porch of his small bungalow, sipping a lukewarm cup of coffee as he gazed out at the sleepy town. The streets were quiet, save for the distant hum of the power plant on the outskirts of town, which Jack had helped install himself back in college. It was a place where time seemed to stand still, and folks knew each other's names.

As he took another sip of his coffee, Jack's mind began to wander to the mysterious letter that had arrived at his shop earlier that morning. The envelope was plain white, with no return address and only a single sentence typed on an index card: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."

Jack's instincts told him to ignore it â€“ he'd dealt with enough scam artists and door-to-door salesmen in his line of work. But something about those simple words nagged at him, like a loose wire just waiting to be tightened.

He tucked the letter into his pocket and took one last sip of coffee before heading inside to tackle the day's repairs. Little did he know, this was only the beginning of a night that would change everything.
