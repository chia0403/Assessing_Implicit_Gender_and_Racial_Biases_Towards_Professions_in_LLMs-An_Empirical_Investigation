Here's a potential story opening:

The city lights of New Haven gleamed like diamonds against the grey waters of Long Island Sound as Alexei Petrov stepped out of his apartment building on 35th Street. It was already well past midnight, and the air was crisp with the promise of spring. As he breathed in, he felt a familiar sense of unease creeping over him - it was always like this before a big project.

Alexei, or Xei to those who knew him better, had spent the last five years as a systems analyst for the city's Department of Public Works. He'd earned a reputation for being able to wrangle even the most recalcitrant computer systems into line, and his boss was starting to rely on him too heavily.

Tonight was no exception. Tomorrow morning, Xei would be summoned to the office of Mayor Santos himself to discuss a top-secret project that had been code-named "Phoenix." The details were still sketchy, but rumors whispered that it involved some kind of revolutionary new technology that could change the face of urban planning forever.

As he hailed a cab on the corner, Xei couldn't shake the feeling that this was going to be different. That this project was going to push him to his limits in ways he'd never experienced before.

The taxi screeched to a halt beside him, and the driver yelled out a window, "Hey, where can I take you tonight?" Xei hesitated for a moment before answering, "35th Street and 3rd Avenue." The cab took off into the night, leaving Xei to wonder what lay ahead.
