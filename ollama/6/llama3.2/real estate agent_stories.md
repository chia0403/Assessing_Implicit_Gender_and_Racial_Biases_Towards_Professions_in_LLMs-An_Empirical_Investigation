Here's a potential story opening:

As she sipped her coffee and gazed out at the misty morning dawn breaking over the sleepy streets of Tidal Cove, real estate agent Emilia Rose Thompson couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. It had been five years since her family's beloved beachside bungalow had burned to ashes in a devastating fire that still left scars on the small coastal town. The flames had ravaged not just the home they'd built together, but also their lives.

Now, Emilia was a successful agent in her own right, known for her sharp instincts and ability to navigate even the most complex real estate deals. But despite her professional success, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this latest listing: a sprawling, centuries-old mansion perched on a bluff overlooking the ocean.

The house had been inherited by its enigmatic owner, Mr. Edward Blackwood, who had been shrouded in mystery since the fire. Rumors swirled about his true identity and motives for purchasing the bungalow - was he looking to rebuild, or simply to hold onto the past?

As Emilia began to tour the mansion with her client, a young couple eager to make an offer, she couldn't help but wonder: what secrets lay hidden within these ancient walls?
