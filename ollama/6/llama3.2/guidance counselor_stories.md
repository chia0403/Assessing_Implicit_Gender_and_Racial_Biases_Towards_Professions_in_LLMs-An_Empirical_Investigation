Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood High School gleamed like polished steel as Emily Rose Wilson stepped out of her office and onto the worn linoleum floor. As one of the guidance counselors, she had spent countless hours in that very room, listening to students pour their hearts out about their struggles and dreams. The fluorescent lights above hummed a soothing melody, but today they seemed to vibrate with an undercurrent of unease.

The air was heavy with the scent of disinfectant and stale coffee, the remnants of a long morning already past its peak. Emily wrapped her arms around herself, feeling the familiar chill of the autumn air seep into her bones. It was November 15th, the day before Thanksgiving break, and the students were beginning to stir with restless energy.

As she gazed out the window at the deserted parking lot, a sense of disquiet settled over Emily like a shroud. Something felt off, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was. Maybe it was the way the rain seemed to be falling more heavily than usual, or perhaps it was the quiet desperation in the voices she'd heard from students earlier that morning. Whatever it was, Emily knew that this day would not be like any other.

She took a deep breath and began to make her way through the empty hallways, nodding to the few stragglers who were still lingering before classes started. The chatter was subdued, the usual din of teenage conversations reduced to hushed whispers as students exchanged worried glances and anxious smiles.

As Emily approached the staff room, she noticed that the principal's assistant, Mrs. Jenkins, was already seated at the table, sipping a cup of coffee and staring intently at her phone. A look of grave concern etched across her face, Emily felt a shiver run down her spine.

"Emily," Mrs. Jenkins said quietly as she saw her approach, "can I talk to you for a minute?"

And with that, the calm before the storm began to unravel...
