The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and hot asphalt as Elwood "Big Easy" Peterson steered his rig across the endless blacktop.  Miles stretched in every direction, swallowed by the desert's heat-hazed horizon. The setting sun bled crimson into the sky, casting long shadows from the towering rigs parked haphazardly along the highway. Big Easy was a veteran of this lonely road – years spent hauling goods across the country, his life measured in miles and truck stops. 

He sighed, shifting into neutral as he approached a deserted gas station. The pump hissed with each stroke, the only sound other than the distant hum of crickets and the wind's whistling through the corrugated metal roof. His rig, "Lucky," was starting to show its age; paint peeling like sunburnt skin, tires worn smooth. But it had carried him across countless miles, and he couldn't help but feel a pang of affection for the old girl.  

Tonight, however, Big Easy wasn’t looking forward to another night in the cramped cab. A restless energy thrummed beneath his tired bones, an unease settled deep within his gut. Something about this stretch of highway felt different; a prickle of foreboding against the wind's chill. The only answer lay in his own heart and the road ahead.
