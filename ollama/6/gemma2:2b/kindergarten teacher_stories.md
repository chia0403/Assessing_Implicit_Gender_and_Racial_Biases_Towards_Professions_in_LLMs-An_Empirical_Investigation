##  Setting: Sunnyside School

**Opening:** 

Sunlight streamed through the oversized windows of Ms. Amelia Carter's classroom at Sunnyside School, dappling the colorful carpet with warm squares. A symphony of sounds filled the air: the joyous squeak of small legs on the bouncy floor, the muffled laughter of children giggling over a game of "Red Light, Green Light," and the soft, rhythmic hum of Mrs. Thompson, the school's resident musician, playing a gentle melody from her trusty ukulele. 

It was the first week back after summer break, and Ms. Carter couldn't help but feel a wave of bittersweet happiness wash over her. The air felt thick with anticipation as she glanced at her classroom door, where a canvas mural depicting an adorable woodland scene depicted the children's imaginations taking flight. It was time for their weekly art session.
