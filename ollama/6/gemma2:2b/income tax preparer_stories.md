## The Tax Return

**Setting:** A cramped office in South Boston, Massachusetts - the year is 2019. It's January, but snow has already begun to melt in patches from earlier storms, leaving behind a canvas of grey and brown that blends into the dreary mood of the city. The air is thick with the scent of printer ink and coffee, mingled with an undercurrent of anxiety as tax season begins its annual onslaught.

**Main Character:** Evelyn O'Malley, age 42, stands hunched over a mountain of paperwork – her usual stoic demeanor softened only by the slight crinkle at the corner of her eyes, which speaks to years spent navigating the complex world of taxes with an unyielding patience she sometimes wished wasn’t so necessary.

Evelyn runs "Evie's Tax Haven," a small storefront crammed with chairs, filing cabinets, and more than a few chipped mugs. Though she yearns for a larger space, her love for this chaotic haven fuels her to keep her doors open – especially during tax season when the familiar faces of her clientele flood in like a tide. 

**Opening:**  The phone rings; the sound echoes through the silence, jolting Evelyn from her contemplation. It's Mrs. O'Connell calling, her voice a weary blend of anxiety and urgency. "Evie, it’s about that loan payment," she whispers, fear tightening her grip on the phone receiver, "I just… I can't seem to make ends meet this month." 

Evelyn takes a deep breath, the familiar aroma of freshly brewed coffee swirling in the air around her.  She sighs, already anticipating the wave of stress and uncertainty that washes over her as she looks at Mrs. O’Connell's precarious financial situation.  “Mrs. O’Connell,” she begins, her voice calm, steady, and reassuring, even as a knot forms in her stomach, “We’ll figure this out.”
