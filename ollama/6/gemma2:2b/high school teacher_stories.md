The humid July air hung thick over Willow Creek High School like a damp sheet clinging to Mr. Alistair Finch's worn tweed jacket.  He stood at his classroom door, the familiar scent of chalk dust and old textbooks clinging to the wood paneling. He was known for three things: his eccentric attire – pockets overflowing with colorful buttons and mismatched socks – and his love for obscure 19th-century poetry; his patience that seemed to stretch beyond even the longest school day; and his ability, some said, to read minds like a Shakespearean tragedy.  

His students were a study in teenage contradictions: aspiring athletes with their eyes glued to their phones, introverted bookworms huddled over worn novels, and loudmouths who seemed to thrive on being disruptive. Yet, this particular summer, Mr. Finch was preoccupied. His usual quiet hum of contentment had been replaced by a nervous tick of the wrist and an unsettling pre-season jitters that gnawed at him.  He could sense it – something was coming, an unexpected change in the air of Willow Creek that sent shivers down his spine like static electricity.
