The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and rosewater, almost suffocatingly sweet as Eliza Wright's fingers carefully arranged a bouquet of lilies for Mrs. Henderson's birthday.  "She's a notoriously difficult woman," her friend Amelia confided, handing her a steaming cup of chamomile tea. "But you always have a knack for making her smile."  Eliza sighed, her usual bright green eyes dimming as she looked at the drooping lilies. The shop, 'Willow and Thorn,' was her haven – filled with lush greenery and vibrant blooms that reflected the capricious nature of the city around it. But lately, even the scent of fresh-cut roses felt like a mocking reminder of her own failing business.  

Eliza ran a hand over the wrinkled paper bag containing Mrs. Henderson's latest order: a collection of lilies for her deceased husband's grave.  The setting sun cast long shadows through the windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the city was bustling, a symphony of honking horns and hurried footsteps; yet, inside Willow and Thorn, time seemed to slow down – a comforting rhythm dictated by the ticking clock above the cashier’s desk.  As Eliza gazed at her reflection in the shop's polished glass door, she knew that despite the city’s relentless beat, there was something within her own heart that needed more than just blooming roses and delicate petals to bloom again.
