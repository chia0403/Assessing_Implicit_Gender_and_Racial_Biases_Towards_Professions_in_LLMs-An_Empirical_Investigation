## Story Opening

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, each flicker a reminder of Elsieâ€™s own stagnant existence. It was 7:01 AM, the official start of another day in "Business First", a sprawling corporate behemoth that felt as outdated and clunky as its floor-to-ceiling filing cabinets. Her name tag read **"Elsie Pennington, Receptionist - Always at Your Service,"** the irony not lost on her. 

The air hung thick with unspoken anxieties; a symphony of hurried footsteps and distant keyboard clicks played out in the echo chamber that was the lobby. Clients, investors, and even occasional interns bustled past, each carrying an untold story in their frenetic movements. Elsie, however, remained stationary, her tired smile plastered across her face like a desperate attempt at normalcy. It wasn't always this way. Before the corporate world swallowed her whole, Elsie had dreamt of being a writer, her words weaving magic onto blank pages. Now, she was just another cog in the machine, forced to witness the drama unfold around her while dreaming about a life beyond the endless stream of calls and paperwork.

**Setting:** 
A modern-day corporate office building located in a bustling downtown city, the air thick with ambition and competition. The lobby is adorned with traditional mahogany furniture, sleek glass walls, and a towering central atrium that serves as both an impressive design feature and a constant reminder of the pressure Elsie feels to keep everything running smoothly.
