The wind howled like a banshee outside the "Shear Perfection" shop, whipping rain against the windowpanes in a furious dance. Inside, Elara Delacroix, her fiery red hair escaping its bun and catching in the air as she moved, hummed a jaunty tune while meticulously trimming a young boy's unruly curls. A faint scent of chamomile and peppermint lingered in the air, a promise of comfort and relaxation amidst the storm.  

Elara, known by many simply as "Elle," was a legend amongst her clientele in this quiet coastal town. Her small, cozy salon on the edge of Main Street had been a haven for decades - a place where worry melted away with each snip and polish, leaving behind only a sense of calm and renewed confidence. This storm, however, seemed to have pushed its fury beyond the ordinary. A sudden crackle of thunder, followed by an echoing boom of lightning, jolted Elara's rhythm as she finished up with the boy's hair. 

She glanced out the window, catching a fleeting glimpse of a silhouette against the tumultuous sky – someone shrouded in darkness, standing at the edge of the street.  Her heart skipped a beat, the familiar tune faltering in her throat. Something wasn’t right.
