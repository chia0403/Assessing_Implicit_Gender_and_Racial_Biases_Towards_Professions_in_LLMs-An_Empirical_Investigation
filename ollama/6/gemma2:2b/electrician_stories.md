The flicker of the overhead lights in "Billy's Best Bits," a diner more hole-in-the-wall than hole-of-a-wall, was like a silent scream against the backdrop of the ceaseless hum of the city. Inside, its linoleum floor held the faint scent of stale coffee and grease, while the worn booths offered refuge from the unforgiving concrete jungle just beyond the plate glass window. 

Billy "Flicker" Fitzgerald wasn't exactly known for his charisma. He was a man of few words, usually content with the quiet hum of his toolkit. At least until Mrs. O'Malley started her daily complaints about the "flaming wires" in her ceiling fan, which she swore were turning into an unholy chorus of chirps.  This was Billy's life; one where circuits and conflict went hand-in-hand, but tonight, a storm brewed on his personal horizon, far from the flickering neon of the diner.

It started with a phone call.
