The weight of centuries of history pressed down on him, a responsibility that came with being an adjudicator for the High Court of Elara, and in this instance, it had brought a rare sense of urgency.

The stakes were higher than mere advancement: their power, the very balance of the realm, rested upon the outcome.  The courtroom buzzed with hushed whispers, a tapestry of anxieties woven through the fabric of time and magic. The clashing energies of the two mages – Kaelen, wielding earth-shaking storms and wielding his fury like molten steel, and Lyra, whose powers flowed in ethereal pulses of moonlight, capable of bending minds to her will - had ignited an unprecedented storm within Elara’s very core.  Justice Thorne, though weary from years of observing the ebb and flow of power play, was ready to orchestrate a symphony of justice as he delivered his final verdict.
