The sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the Sangre de Cristo mountains, painting the horizon in hues of bruised plum and burnt orange.  Dust motes danced in the fading light as it kissed the weathered face of Jebediah "Jeb" Thorne, his blue eyes narrowed against the growing shadows. The scent of sagebrush and hay filled the air, a familiar comfort that clashed with the gnawing unease churning inside him. He surveyed his ranch, “Thorne's End,” stretching before him like a silent testament to hardship and resilience. It was a sprawling expanse of tawny grasslands and craggy mesas, its weathered fences worn smooth by years of constant wind.  The storm had been coming for days, brewing under the relentless summer sun, and now it finally broke with an unholy roar. Jeb's calloused hand tightened on the handle of his trusty Winchester as he gazed towards the darkening sky, the ominous thunder rolling closer like a predator stalking its prey. The rain would come soon, but tonight, he didn't just fear the storm; he feared what it might unleash.
