The late-afternoon sun cast long shadows across the polished marble floors of The Grand Zenith Hotel. Even at this ungodly hour, the silence was oppressive, broken only by the soft whirring of the air conditioner and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia Thorne's worn black shoes on the plush carpet. As concierge for the last five years, Amelia had a deep familiarity with the hotel’s hushed corners and echoing hallways. It wasn't just the building that held her captive; it was the unspoken tension that lingered in every polished surface, a feeling that something momentous was about to happen. 

Amelia’s amber eyes scanned the empty lobby as she stood at the center of the grand staircase.  The ornate railing felt cold beneath her fingertips. A sense of foreboding hung heavy, thick enough to smother the opulent chandeliers with their twinkling light. The air held the scent of a storm brewing – of unfulfilled promises and secrets lurking in the shadows.
