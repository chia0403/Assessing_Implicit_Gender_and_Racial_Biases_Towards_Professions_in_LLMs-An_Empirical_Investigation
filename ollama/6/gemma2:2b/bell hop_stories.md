The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Rain lashed against the high-ceilinged lobby of The Grand Majestic, blurring the opulent mosaic tiles in a dizzying dance of blues and greens. Inside, the usually bustling heart of the hotel felt like a frozen tomb; even the grand piano, normally a metronome to the social symphony, was silent save for the occasional creak of its ancient frame.  

This was the domain of Cecil Thorne, bell hop extraordinaire, his name a whispered legend amongst the weary souls who sought solace from their own personal storms within The Grand Majestic's walls.  Cecil himself carried the weight of countless lost loves and faded dreams in his calloused hands as he checked guests into their rooms - each one a story waiting to be told. Tonight, however, felt different; a dissonant chord played on his battered piano-shaped bell at the foot of the grand staircase seemed to echo the melancholy that clung to the very air.
