The air hung thick and greasy with the scent of linseed oil and burnt varnish. Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy skylight above, illuminating Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's calloused hands as she carefully adjusted the tiny metal ruler on her workbench.  It was a Tuesday afternoon at the Hawthorne drafting firm, nestled in the cobbled alley behind an old clock factory in Providence. This city was more than its timeworn facades, though. It held secrets within the creaky walls of its historic buildings, whispers of past lives that clung to the worn floorboards and faded wallpaper.  Amy’s grandfather had started the firm here decades ago, but his stories were starting to fade too, each one replaced by a gnawing silence from Amelia's ancestors – a silent legacy she was desperately trying to decipher. 

Amy wasn't sure what she would discover in those dusty, forgotten blueprints. Would it be a map of hidden tunnels? A recipe for an elixir of youth? Or just the echo of her family’s whispered dreams?  The answer, like a half-finished sketch on a crumpled page, remained elusive – waiting to come alive beneath Amy's own hand, one meticulous line at a time.
