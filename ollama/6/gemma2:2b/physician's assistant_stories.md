The humid air hung thick in Dr. Elias Vance's throat as he stepped out onto the hospital porch. Even with the gentle breeze rustling the palm trees across the courtyard, the heat clung to him like an unwanted guest. He inhaled deeply, hoping to catch a hint of fresh air but only met more exhaust fumes from passing ambulances. This wasn't the San Diego sunshine he'd hoped for; this was more akin to a swampy backwater. 

Elias Vance, P.A., had been summoned by Dr. Sanchez - his mentor and long-time friend who now lived in the sweltering city of El Dorado. It wasn't like him to turn down an invitation to help. Elias, with his unwavering optimism and quick wit, was a constant companion for the brilliant, but somewhat cynical, Sanchez. 

Now, though, he found himself facing a storm of frustration as he looked at the dilapidated building across the street. The Sanatorium El Dorado – once a beacon of hope for those suffering from chronic illness – now stood abandoned, its grand facade crumbling beneath the weight of time and neglect. It was supposed to be a rehabilitation center, but lately, it seemed like more of an asylum for troubled souls.

Elias sighed as he pulled out his phone. This wasn't exactly what he had in mind when he’d agreed to help with Dr. Sanchez’s request.
