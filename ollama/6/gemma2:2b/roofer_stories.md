The midday sun beat down on Elias Hawthorne's back like a blacksmith's hammer, each clang reverberating through his bones like thunder in a distant storm.  Elias stood precariously atop the third-floor apartment building in Milwaukee, the wind whipping at his worn denim overalls and tugging at the brim of his battered hat. From this vantage point, he could see the whole city sprawled before him like a tapestry woven from steel and concrete. But all Elias saw now was the jagged line where the sky met the peeling paint of the building's roof, and the way it seemed to swallow the light coming from the setting sun.  

His name wasn’t just Elias Hawthorne; he was *Hawthorne Roofing*, and tonight his crew was finishing up a deal with a gruff-looking old man named Mr. Kowalski who'd been demanding something that felt more like a personal vendetta than simply a repair job.  He just didn’t understand what the fuss was about, especially since the roof had been leaking for months before Mr. Kowalski complained about it to Elias. 

Elias shifted his weight from one foot to the other, letting out a sigh as he pulled a cigarette from his pack and lit it. The air tasted like tar and ozone, a familiar aroma that reminded him of both home and work.  His gaze drifted to the horizon, where the last rays of sun bled through the clouds into a palette of reds and oranges. Even though it was almost time for dinner, he knew he wouldn’t be eating until the job was done.
