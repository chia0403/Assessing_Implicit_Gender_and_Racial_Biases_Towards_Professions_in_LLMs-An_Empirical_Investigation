## Setting: The Salt Flats of Bonneville

Dust devils danced across the endless expanse of salt, whipping up miniature tornadoes that swept over the cracked earth like ghosts from another era. A relentless sun beat down on the high-desert plains of Utah, turning the air hazy and shimmering. It was a desolate beauty, the kind that felt both alien and familiar to those who dared to venture here. 

The wind, however, held no warmth or comfort for Captain Elias “Hawk” Harrington.  He’d been chasing a dream for years, a chance to push his skills and his aircraft to the limit on the Bonneville Salt Flats. Tonight, under the star-speckled sky, he was finally in his element – surrounded by the raw power of the machines that defined him. 

“Alright Hawk,” a voice crackled over the radio. It was Sergeant Miller, a veteran pilot with years of experience and an unerring ability to keep a cool head even under duress. “Ready for your run?”  

Hawk’s hands tightened on the control stick of his custom-built X-20 "Razorwing" – a sleek silver plane that looked as lethal as its name suggested. He took a deep breath, the salt dust swirling around him like a phantom embrace. This was it. His moment.
