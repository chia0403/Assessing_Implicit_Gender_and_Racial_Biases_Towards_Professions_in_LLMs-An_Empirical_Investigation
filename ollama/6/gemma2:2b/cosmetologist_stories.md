The air hung heavy with the scent of hairspray and lavender, the usual comforting aroma of Esmeralda's salon transformed into something almost suffocating by the humidity of July.  Esmeralda adjusted her thick spectacles as she peered over her counter at the tangle of unruly curls before her â€“ a masterpiece in its own right, if you squinted hard enough. The client, Ms. Eleanor Beaumont, was an enigma wrapped in silk and frustration. 

The salon, "L'Escargot,"  had been Esmeralda's refuge since she'd fled the chaos of Paris for a quieter life on the coast.  It had once brimmed with laughter and the sweet scent of fresh-baked croissants, but now it seemed to be slowly succumbing to the relentless march of time. This humidity, Ms. Beaumont's constant sighing, and the pile of overdue bills waiting in her drawer were starting to feel like a symphony of despair. 


**Setting:**  A seaside town in Maine with a small-town charm but hidden beneath it is a sense of quiet unease. The air is thick with salty sea spray and promises of summer storms.  The shops have storefronts that are pastel-painted, their wood worn smooth from years of sun and rain. 

**Main character:** Esmeralda "Esme" Delacroix - a skilled cosmetologist whose passion for her craft has been tempered by the weight of time and responsibility.
