## The Last Inkwell

**Setting:** A dilapidated Victorian house on the edge of a sleepy coastal town in Maine.  Rain pattered against the attic windows, blurring the already fading light as an oppressive mist settled over the crumbling stone facade. 

**Main character:** **Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood**, renowned author known for her haunting gothic fiction and vivid portrayal of life's hidden shadows.  She’d once believed she had found solace in this lonely house, a haven built upon the memories of lost loves and untold stories. Now, however, even the silence seemed to amplify her growing unease. 

**Opening:** Ellie clutched the worn leather-bound journal, its pages yellowed with age and stained by years of water damage. It was here, amidst the dusty relics of a forgotten era, that she’d discovered it - a cryptic note tucked between the frayed edges of an old inscription. The ink smudged like tears on paper, each letter a whispered message from someone she barely knew. 

“They say the sea holds secrets,” it read. “Some are best left buried.”  

Ellie's heart sank. This was not just another footnote in her life’s work, but a chilling echo of what she feared most - that the stories she had conjured for years were not entirely fictional. The house itself seemed to hum with an unspoken truth, and Ellie felt the urge to unravel it before the shadows consumed her too.
