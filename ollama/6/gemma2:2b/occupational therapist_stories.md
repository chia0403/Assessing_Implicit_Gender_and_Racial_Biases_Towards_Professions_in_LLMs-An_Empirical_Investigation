The scent of chlorine was almost suffocating as Elara adjusted her oversized sunnies. It was August, and even though the air was already thick with humidity, she had found herself drawn to the bustling pool area at the "Sunny Shores" rehab center.  There was something about the rhythmic splash of children learning how to swim, or the quiet dignity of an elderly gentleman relearning his stroke, that stirred a deep sense of purpose within Elara. 

Elara's name, like her sunny disposition and calm demeanor, exuded a gentle grace. It wasn't just her job as an occupational therapist, she truly believed in helping people rebuild their lives - even if it was something as simple as learning to use a fork properly again after a stroke.  But today, Elara felt a peculiar unease. The usual hum of activity around the pool seemed strangely subdued. Even the children's giggles, usually joyous and infectious, sounded hollow, almost forced. The source of her unease lay in Mrs. Henderson's quiet gaze from across the room.

The woman was known for her sharp wit, witty one-liners and an even sharper tongue - Elara had learned that much during her years at Sunny Shores.  But today, Mrs. Henderson lookedâ€¦lost. A flicker of panic crossed her eyes as she watched a young boy struggling to keep his head above water in the shallow end. The scene was almost surreal: playful chaos turned into panicked struggle, all within seconds.
 
The air seemed to crackle with a strange energy - something that sent shivers down Elara's spine. She knew there were some secrets buried deep within Sunny Shores' seemingly idyllic facade, and she was about to unearth them.
