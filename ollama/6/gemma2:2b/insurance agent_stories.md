The humid air hung thick as grease in the office.  It clung to Eleanor Thorne's suit like an unwanted guest, even with the AC cranked to the bone. The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above her head, casting long, unflattering shadows across her desk piled high with insurance binders and paperwork. She tapped a finger against the thick glass of her water bottle, its condensation slowly pooling in the mug's base. 

Eleanor Thorne wasnâ€™t built for this kind of office life. Not after years spent flitting from job to job like a moth drawn to a flickering flame. But here she was - an insurance agent at the bottom rung of the ladder, with her dreams seemingly as distant as the last time she'd actually held a book without needing to use a magnifying glass to read it. Her father, once a renowned lawyer, had taught her about the weight of responsibility and the importance of fairness in life, but his words now felt hollow in the face of her current reality.  


**Setting:** A small, run-down office in the heart of a midwestern city. 

**Character:** Eleanor Thorne, an insurance agent struggling with her unfulfilled ambitions and facing an increasingly daunting future.
