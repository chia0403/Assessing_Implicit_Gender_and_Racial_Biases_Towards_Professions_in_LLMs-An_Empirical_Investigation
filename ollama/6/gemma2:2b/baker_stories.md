The morning mist clung to the cobblestones like a hesitant breath before dawn. The air was thick with the scent of woodsmoke and fresh-baked bread – the smell so familiar that Amelia barely registered it at first. She stood amidst the chaos of her bakery, "Sugarplum's", watching as the early birds began their flurry of activity outside. 

Amelia’s hands, calloused from years of kneading dough and shaping pastries, rested on the worn wood counter of her shop.  Her name, though a testament to her dedication to creating something sweet in every bite, was a stark contrast to the bitter winds that seemed to seep through the cracks in their old bakery walls. 

**Name:** Amelia "Amy" Everleigh
