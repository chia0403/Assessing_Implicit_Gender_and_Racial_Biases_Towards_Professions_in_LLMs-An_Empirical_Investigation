The early morning mist clung to the sprawling oaks like ghostly fingers, shrouding Briarwood Manor in an eerie silence that even Bartholomew “Barty” Bumblefoot, the manor’s stoic groundskeeper for thirty years, couldn't dispel.  He stood amidst the manicured lawns and rose gardens, his worn leather boots crunching on damp earth, a familiar melody of the rising sun playing through the open window of the nearby kitchen. The gentle creak of the old gate as he passed through it was almost soothing, until it became the only sound that broke the quiet air. 

Barty’s weathered face, usually etched with a grim resolve, held a flicker of unease this morning. Today wasn't a normal day. There were no birdsong or rustling leaves to announce the new season’s arrival; the silence was too profound, too unnatural. It had been almost three months since Mrs. Hawthorne, the manor's owner and sole resident, had disappeared. The only clue left behind was an empty teacup on her chaise lounge in the rose garden, a testament to her sudden departure, yet unsolved.  Barty knew, deep down, that something wasn’t right – this silence was too heavy for a summer morning.
