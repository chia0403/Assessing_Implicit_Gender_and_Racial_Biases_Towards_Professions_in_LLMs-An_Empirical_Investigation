The rain hammered against the windowpanes, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia's heart.  She sat at her desk in the cramped, sterile confines of St. Jude’s Emergency Room, a worn teddy bear clutched tightly to her chest as she reviewed medical charts. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting harsh shadows on the faces of weary patients and exhausted colleagues. Every beep of the EKG monitor felt like a hammer blow to Amelia's soul. 

Amelia was used to chaos -  after years of working in emergency rooms across the city, she’d developed an unshakeable resilience. Yet tonight, even her hardened exterior couldn't hide the tremor running through her fingers as she read the latest report on young Ethan, a fifteen-year-old who'd been hit by a truck while crossing the street. 

Ethan’s face was already familiar, etched in memory from countless late nights spent charting his vitals and wrestling with her own anxieties. The boy had become more than just a patient; he was a fleeting hope in a city where every new dawn seemed to bring fresh despair. He was another casualty of the unforgiving streets that Amelia swore she'd do everything to protect, even if it meant sacrificing something precious - like sleep, maybe, or even her sanity sometimes. 


**Setting:** A cramped, dimly lit emergency room at a large city hospital in New York City. The sounds of medical equipment and the hushed voices of nurses create an atmosphere both sterile and tense.  The only other occupants are Ethan's parents, their faces etched with worry.   
 

**Main character:** Amelia Miller, Registered Nurse.
