## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** A creaky, old Victorian house, nestled amongst towering pines in rural Maine. Sunlight spills through dusty windows, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing on faded floral wallpaper. The air smells of damp wood and forgotten dreams.

**Character:**  Ms. Elara Thorne is a wisp of a woman with eyes that hold the deep blue of a summer sky. At thirty-five, she's spent her life in this house, transformed it from a neglected shell into a haven for her students - all while trying to outrun the ghosts whispered about in hushed tones around the fire.  

**Story Opening:**

The bell’s sharp clang echoed through the halls of Pinewood Elementary. Ms. Thorne had never quite adjusted to the unsettling quiet that followed, like an echo from a forgotten song. The classroom was bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun, and its usual cacophony of eager voices seemed muffled by the weight of unspoken things.  

“Alright class,” she began, her voice surprisingly strong despite the tremor in her hands. “Today we're learning about the history of this beautiful building!” 

A wave of stifled whispers rippled through the rows of students, their eyes flitting to the faded portraits of stern-faced men and women on the walls. They were all captivated by the stories of these historical figures, but they also sensed something else – a lingering tension in the air that felt thicker than usual. 

“Just like us,” Ms. Thorne continued, her gaze steady despite the unease gnawing at her stomach. "Each one with their own story to tell. And sometimes," she paused, letting the silence hang heavy, “the walls whisper theirs.”
