The humid air clung to Evelyn Thorne like a damp sheet as she surveyed the cramped apartment with its peeling paint and cracked linoleum floor.  Her eyes focused on the faded floral wallpaper, remnants of a life lived before the accident that had left her with nothing but this broken shell, and an aching emptiness inside. The air buzzed with an electric current of frustration; she was supposed to be treating patients, not staring at a reflection of her own desolation in the worn mirror above the chipped sink.  Evelyn was more accustomed to the rhythmic thump of therapy balls against concrete floors, the comforting scent of antiseptic, and the smiles of her recovering patients than this suffocating silence.

Setting: A run-down apartment in a bustling city neighborhood with a focus on the details of decay. 
Main Character: Evelyn Thorne - Physical Therapist.
