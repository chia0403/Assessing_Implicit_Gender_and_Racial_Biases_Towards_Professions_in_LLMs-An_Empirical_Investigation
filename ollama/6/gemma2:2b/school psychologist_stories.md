The fluorescent hum of the office lights was almost a soothing drone to Dr. Amelia Harding's ears. She wasn't quite sure why she found it so calming, but amidst the usual chaos of Pinewood High School, her small corner office felt like a safe harbor.  Outside the window, teenagers bustled in and out, their anxieties swirling alongside the wind gusts that whistled through the cracked blinds.

She stared at the neatly organized file on her desk - Sarah Miller's case.  The name was like a beacon in the swirling sea of paperwork: her latest project; another attempt to understand a girl whose world seemed to be constantly under attack by invisible forces.
