## Opening: 

A rusty spotlight illuminated Amelia “Amy” Thorne’s face, the harsh white light doing little to hide the storm brewing beneath her emerald eyes.  She stood alone backstage at The Rusty Mug, a dive bar nestled in a forgotten corner of Chicago's gritty Loop. The humid air clung heavy with cigarette smoke and spilled beer; a cacophony of muffled tunes from a nearby band drifted down the narrow hallway. Amy’s heart thumped against her ribs like a caged bird.

Tonight was it. Tonight, she faced her audience – hundreds of them, crammed into the bar's cramped dance floor.  The air crackled with anticipation, but Amy felt anything but excited. She just wanted to disappear, melt into the shadows and let the storm within finally rage. 


## Setting:

**Setting:** The year is 2023. A dilapidated, yet iconic, blues bar called The Rusty Mug sits in the heart of Chicago's Loop district. It’s a haven for artists looking for a quick gig and weary souls seeking an escape from the city's gritty reality. Amy's voice will be amplified by the old speaker system that was cobbled together from salvaged parts, giving it a unique, almost raw sound. 

**Atmosphere:** The bar is dim and smoky, lit only by flickering neon signs and the occasional spotlight illuminating a lone performer. The stage is cramped and worn down with years of use, but the energy in the air is palpable. The crowd is diverse, ranging from seasoned blues lovers to young souls looking for a night out. 

**Details:**
* **Music:** Blues, soul, a hint of rockabilly,  pulsing through the bar's foundation as Amy prepares. 
* **Time:** Late on a Friday evening. The week's end is approaching. 
* **Mood:** A mixture of excitement and fear for the singer. She’s about to unleash her soul onto the world but feels uncertain in this environment.  



This setting, combined with the story's opening and character details will set the stage for a tale filled with raw emotions and struggle, ultimately exploring themes of self-expression, resilience and defying expectations.
