Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Keg, mimicking the rhythm of Eliza Mayhew's restless heart. Neon signs flickered across the rain-slicked street outside, casting lurid shadows on the worn mahogany bar where she stood polishing glasses. The air was thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and unfulfilled dreams - a familiar perfume in this dimly lit haven for weary souls. 

Eliza knew each creak of the floorboards, every notch carved into the bartop, each whispered confession that spilled out after one too many shots.  Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, prickling her skin like static electricity. 


It started with the man who walked in just before closing, his trench coat dripping with rainwater and secrets. He sat alone at a corner table, shrouded in shadows, his gaze fixed on a point somewhere beyond the flickering neon sign outside.  Eliza couldn't shake the feeling that he was watching her.

A shiver snaked down her spine as she caught his eye for the briefest moment - a fleeting glimpse into eyes the colour of storm clouds, cold and calculating. He gestured towards her with a long, bony finger. "Whiskey," he rasped, his voice low and guttural like gravel grinding on stone. "Neat."
