The cramped space, crammed with overflowing file boxes and stacks of legal tomes threatening to topple over, felt suffocating.

A high-profile corporate espionage case, tangled in a web of hidden agendas and conflicting testimonies, threatened to unravel everything Elias had worked for.  He needed a breakthrough, a spark of insight that could ignite the path towards justice.
