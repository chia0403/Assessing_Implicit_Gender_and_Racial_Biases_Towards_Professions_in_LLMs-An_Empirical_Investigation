The July sun beat down on Jasper Bartholomew's neck as he wrestled a stubborn hydrangea bush into submission. Sweat stung his eyes, but he refused to let it win. This was Mrs. Higgins' prized possession, and she'd entrusted him, Jasper Bartholomew, owner and operator of "Bartholomew's Blooming Beauties," with its delicate relocation. 

He glanced up at the sprawling Victorian home perched on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Willow Creek. Ivy climbed its walls like emerald snakes, framing arched windows that looked out onto a garden bursting with color: roses in fiery hues, lavender spilling over stone pathways, and sunflowers bowing their heads towards the sun. It was a gardener's paradise, one Jasper had meticulously cultivated for years.

But today, something felt off. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he noticed a glint of sunlight reflecting off something unusual nestled among the rose bushes - a small, silver locket etched with intricate floral designs. Curiosity tugged at him, and he carefully extracted it from the tangled blooms.
