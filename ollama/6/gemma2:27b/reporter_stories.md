The stench of stale beer and desperation clung to the air in The Rusty Mug like cheap cologne.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a feverish smear. Emilia Thorne, her trench coat dripping onto the sticky linoleum floor, grimaced as she pushed through the swinging doors. 

The Rusty Mug was the kind of place where dreams went to die and secrets whispered in the shadows. It was also, unfortunately for Emilia, the last known haunt of Danny "Fingers" Malone, a small-time crook rumored to have information on a much bigger case: the disappearance of city councilman William Blackwood. 


Emilia scanned the dimly lit bar, her eyes searching for any sign of Fingers. A grizzled bartender with a face like crumpled paper wiped down a glass with a sigh, his gaze flicking over Emilia with weary disinterest. In the corner booth, a trio of men hunched over a game of cards, their faces illuminated by the sickly yellow glow of a single overhead bulb.  The rest of the bar was deserted, save for a lone figure slumped at the end of the counter, nursing a glass that looked suspiciously empty.
