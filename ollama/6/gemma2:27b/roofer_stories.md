The July sun hammered down on Cedar Creek, turning the asphalt streets into shimmering mirages. Sweat beaded on Elias "Eli" Callahan's forehead as he wrestled a heavy bundle of shingles onto the peaked roof of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian home. He wasn't complaining, though. The heat was brutal, but it meant work. And for Eli, work meant keeping his head above water and a roof over his own.

Cedar Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was a town clinging to its past. Old brick storefronts lined Main Street, their windows reflecting a faded grandeur, and whispers of coal mining history lingered in the air like coal dust itself. Eli knew this town inside and out. He'd grown up here, his boots leaving scuff marks on the same cobblestone sidewalks as generations before him. 

But Cedar Creek was changing. Factories were shutting down, young folks were heading to the cities, and the once-vibrant heart of the town was starting to fade. Eli, however, refused to leave. This was his home, warts and all. He'd stay, fix its roofs one shingle at a time, and hope that somehow, Cedar Creek could find its way back.
