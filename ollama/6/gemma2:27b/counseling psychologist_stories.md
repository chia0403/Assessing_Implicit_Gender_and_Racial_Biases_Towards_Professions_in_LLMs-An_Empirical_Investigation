Rain hammered against the dusty windowpane, mimicking the frantic rhythm in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest. The antique clock on her bookshelf chimed six times, each gong reverberating through the cluttered office like a hammer blow. Six o'clock. He was late. Again.

Eleanor nervously tapped a chipped porcelain unicorn figurine on her desk. This was supposed to be a breakthrough session for Michael, her most challenging client. After months of strained trust and guarded silences, he’d finally agreed to delve into the childhood trauma that haunted him. But now, with each tick of the clock, doubt gnawed at Eleanor. Had she pushed too hard? Was he simply afraid?

Her office, nestled in a converted Victorian townhouse on a quiet street in Edinburgh, held the comforting scent of lavender and old books. Sunlight rarely penetrated the heavy velvet curtains, preferring to bathe the room in a perpetual twilight. On her desk, beside the unicorn, lay a worn leather-bound journal – Michael's. He had entrusted it to her, filled with fragmented memories and tortured introspection.

As Eleanor stared at the journal, the doorbell rang, sharp and unexpected. A sliver of hope pierced through her anxiety. He hadn’t forgotten.
