The air hung thick with the smell of garlic bread and desperation. Emilia Rose Santiago balanced a tray laden with overflowing pasta bowls and sweating glasses of iced tea, weaving through the crowded tables of "Mama Rosa's." It was Friday night, which meant chaos. Families crammed into booths, couples huddled in dimly lit corners, and groups of boisterous college students took up half the restaurant. Every order felt like an emergency, every spilled glass a potential catastrophe. Emilia, however, moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned performer. 

Her dark ponytail bounced against her burgundy apron as she navigated the throngs, her brown eyes scanning for hungry faces and empty plates. A single bead of sweat trickled down her temple, but she swiped it away with the back of her hand, determined not to break her stride. Tonight, Mama Rosa's needed Emilia Rose Santiago, and Emilia Rose Santiago wouldn't let them down.
