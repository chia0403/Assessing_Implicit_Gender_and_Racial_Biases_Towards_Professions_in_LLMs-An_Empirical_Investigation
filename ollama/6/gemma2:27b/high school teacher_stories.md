The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation in Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom. Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, illuminated swirling motes dancing above the chipped desks, each one scarred by generations of bored teenagers carving initials into its surface. Outside, cicadas thrummed a relentless summer symphony, mocking Eleanor's dwindling hope that this year might be different.

She adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose, and stared at the unruly mass of teenagers sprawled before her. Fifteen pairs of eyes stared back, glazed with boredom or defiance. This was Ms. Vance's tenth year teaching English Literature at Willow Creek High School, and she had learned one harsh truth: teenagers were allergic to Shakespeare. 

Today's lesson, "Romeo and Juliet," felt like an insurmountable obstacle.  Eleanor knew the story inside out, its tragic beauty resonating deep within her soul, but convincing these apathetic adolescents of its relevance felt impossible. As the bell chimed, signaling the start of class, Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for another uphill battle. Perhaps today, she thought wistfully, something would click. Perhaps today, she could reignite their imaginations.
