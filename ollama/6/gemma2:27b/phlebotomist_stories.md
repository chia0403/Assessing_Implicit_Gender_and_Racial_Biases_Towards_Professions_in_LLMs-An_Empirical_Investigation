The harsh fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of vinyl chairs in the waiting room.  A faint scent of antiseptic hung in the air, mingling with the nervous sweat of patients and the cloying sweetness of the artificial lavender diffuser. Evangeline "Eve" Ramirez sighed, adjusting her name tag – "Evangeline Ramirez, Certified Phlebotomist." 

She hated Mondays. The queue for bloodwork always snaked out the door on Mondays, fueled by weekend indulgences and a renewed sense of dread about the week ahead.  Today was no different. A line of anxious faces stared back at her from behind the glass partition – a businessman clutching a coffee cup, a teenager fiddling with his phone, an elderly woman gripping a worn rosary. 

Eve glanced down at her cart, its stainless steel gleaming under the unforgiving lights. Inside, nestled amongst vials and cotton balls, lay a single rosebud – a small act of rebellion against the sterile environment. Today, she needed beauty. She needed a reminder that life wasn't just about drawing blood.
