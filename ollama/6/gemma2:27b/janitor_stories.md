The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the linoleum floor.  Edgar Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins hunched over his mop bucket, the scent of disinfectant battling with the lingering aroma of stale coffee and desperation that clung to this particular office building like cobwebs. It was 2:00 am, the witching hour for Bart, when the silence of the empty cubicles felt heaviest and the ghosts of unfinished work seemed to whisper from beneath desks. He dipped his mop into the soapy water, its rhythmic slosh a counterpoint to the muffled ticking of the building's aging clock, counting down the minutes until his shift ended.

Tonight, though, the usual quiet hum of anticipation was disrupted by an unsettling anomaly: a faint, ethereal humming emanating from deep within the labyrinthine office complex. It vibrated through the floorboards and up Bart's legs, sending shivers down his spine despite the stifling heat radiating from the cleaning supplies he carried. 

Bart paused, mop suspended mid-air. This wasn't the rumble of the ancient air conditioning unit or the clatter of a stray pigeon trapped in the ventilation shaft. This was something else entirely, something that stirred an ancient fear within him, a fear he couldn't quite place.
