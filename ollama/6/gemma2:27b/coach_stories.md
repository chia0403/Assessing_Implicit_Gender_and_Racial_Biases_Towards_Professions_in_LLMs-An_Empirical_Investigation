The humid Mississippi air hung thick as Amelia "Ace" Carter wiped sweat from her brow. Dust motes danced in the beams of the setting sun that pierced through the gaps in the rusty tin roof of the old gym. The squeak of sneakers on warped wood echoed around the cavernous space, punctuated by the occasional grunt or thud as her team, the Bayou Blasters, ran drills. Ace watched them with a critical eye, her own faded basketball jersey clinging to her lean frame. 

This town, Harmony Springs, hadn't seen a championship team in decades, but Ace was determined to change that. She believed in these kids, saw the spark of potential in their raw talent and unyielding spirit. They just needed someone to guide them, to push them past their self-doubt and into greatness. 

Today, though, something felt off. The energy wasn't there, the usual fire dimmed. Ace knew it had something to do with the whispers circulating around town, rumors that threatened to unravel everything she'd worked so hard to build.
