The whine of static filled Elias Finch's ears as he adjusted the dial on the ancient Hallicrafters receiver. Dust motes danced in the shaft of sunlight slicing through the grimy window of his cluttered workshop.  Outside, the humid Louisiana air pressed against the tin roof, a symphony of cicadas and distant thunder accompanying the crackling radio waves. Elias sighed, wiping sweat from his brow with a greasy rag.

The signal was weak, fading in and out like a ghost trying to speak. It was an amateur broadcast, originating somewhere deep in the bayou, its message a jumble of coded phrases and strange humming noises. Elias leaned closer, captivated by the mystery. He'd been tracking this signal for weeks, ever since it first pierced through the usual cacophony of police chatter and weather reports. 


He knew better than to pry into things he didn't understand, but something about the enigmatic broadcast drew him in like a moth to a flame. Perhaps it was the loneliness of his work, or the yearning for adventure that flickered within his soul. Whatever the reason, Elias Finch was determined to crack the code and uncover the secrets hidden within those ghostly whispers.
