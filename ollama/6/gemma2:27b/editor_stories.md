Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Eleanor Vance's cramped office. The city outside was a watercolour smear of greys and yellows, the streetlights blurring into halos in the downpour. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and paper, the rhythmic clatter of Eleanor's keyboard the only counterpoint to the incessant drumming of the rain.

Eleanor, her auburn hair escaping its bun and framing a face etched with fatigue and determination, stared at the screen. Lines of text swam before her eyes, each word a potential stumbling block in the precarious edifice of her latest project â€“ a historical novel set in 19th century London. She was responsible for guiding it through the treacherous labyrinth of revisions, ensuring its accuracy and coherence while preserving the author's voice.  It was a daunting task, one that often felt like wrestling with phantoms.

Tonight, however, the manuscript seemed to be fighting back with particular ferocity. A stubborn plot hole yawned open on page 247, threatening to swallow the entire narrative whole. Eleanor sighed, her fingers hovering over the keyboard, unsure of where to begin mending the frayed fabric of the story.  As if in answer to her unspoken plea, a sharp knock reverberated through the small office, followed by the creak of the door opening.
