The air in Elara Vance's atelier hummed with the rhythmic click of her shears against silk. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing over bolts of shimmering velvet and embroidered brocade. Outside, Paris bustled with the vibrant energy of a spring afternoon, but inside, time seemed to slow, each stitch a deliberate whisper in the symphony of creation. Elara paused, her brow furrowed in concentration as she adjusted the delicate draping of a sapphire gown, its bodice adorned with hand-stitched silver stars that shimmered like constellations against the midnight blue fabric. 

A sudden rapping on the heavy oak door startled her. Elara smoothed down her apron, a faded patchwork of floral prints and threadbare linen, and called out, "Come in!"


The door creaked open, revealing Madame Dubois, a formidable woman with steel-grey hair piled high and eyes that seemed to see through any facade. She surveyed the atelier with a critical gaze before fixing Elara with an unwavering stare. 

"Elara Vance," she announced, her voice as sharp as her impeccably tailored suit, "I have a proposition for you."
