The rusted clang of a wrench against metal echoed through the cavernous garage, punctuated by the insistent chirping of crickets outside. Sweat dripped from Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez's brow, blurring the grease smudged across her nose. A stubborn bolt refused to budge on the carburetor of a 1967 Mustang, its chrome dulled with age and neglect. Ellie huffed, shifting her weight and applying more leverage.  

The garage was a symphony of organized chaos: tools hung neatly on pegboards, spare parts nestled in labelled bins, and half-disassembled engines sat patiently on stands like mechanical dinosaurs. The air hung heavy with the scent of oil, gasoline, and the faint metallic tang of ozone from her welding torch. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the dusty lot, baking the asphalt until it shimmered.

Ellie wasn't just any mechanic. She was a whisperer of engines, a magician who could coax life back into rusty hulks with a combination of brute strength and delicate touch. But this Mustang, with its chipped paint and weary engine, was proving to be a particularly stubborn patient.
