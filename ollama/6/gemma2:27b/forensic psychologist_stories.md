Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the drumming anxiety in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest. The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across the steel table, illuminating the nervous fidgeting of the man across from her.  

His name was Simon Hayes, a slight, bespectacled accountant with perpetually damp palms and haunted eyes. He claimed to have no memory of the night his wife, Amelia, vanished without a trace. The police, however, were unconvinced. 

Eleanor leaned forward, her gaze unwavering. "Mr. Hayes," she began, her voice steady and reassuring despite the unease churning within her, "let's talk about your relationship with Amelia."


The setting:

* **Location:** A dingy interrogation room in a bustling metropolitan police station.
* **Time:** Late evening, a stormy night amplifies the tense atmosphere.
* **Atmosphere:** Claustrophobic, filled with unspoken tension and suspicion. 

Eleanor Vance is a seasoned forensic psychologist, known for her sharp intellect and uncanny ability to read people's minds. She is determined to uncover the truth behind Amelia Hayes' disappearance, but Simon's amnesia presents a formidable obstacle.
