The acrid scent of burnt iron hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweat clinging to Elias Thorne's brow. He stood rigidly atop the crumbling rampart, his weathered leather gauntlet gripping the hilt of his longsword. Below him, the sprawling ruins of Aeloria groaned under a relentless sky choked with ash. Once a jewel of the Western Kingdoms, it was now a desolate husk, its grandeur swallowed by the creeping tendrils of a nameless blight that had ravaged the land for decades. 

Elias, a veteran guard sworn to protect what remained of the city's dwindling populace, scanned the horizon through narrowed eyes. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the distant rasping cough of wind sifting through shattered windows and the mournful creak of decaying timbers. He knew that somewhere out there, amongst the twisted shadows and skeletal trees, lurked the creatures spawned from the blight â€“ grotesque monstrosities with obsidian skin and glowing crimson eyes.

Today, a chilling unease gnawed at Elias's gut. The usual cacophony of their guttural growls and rasping shrieks was absent. It felt like the calm before a storm, a stillness that promised nothing but unimaginable horrors.  His hand tightened around his sword hilt, knuckles white with anticipation. Something was coming. He could feel it in his bones.
