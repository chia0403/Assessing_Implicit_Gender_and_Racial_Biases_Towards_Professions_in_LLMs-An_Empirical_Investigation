Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quibble's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside him. His tie, loosened in frustration, hung askew over his rumpled shirt. The flickering fluorescent lights cast an anemic glow on stacks of paperwork threatening to engulf his tiny desk. Outside, the neon sign of "Quibble & Sons Insurance: Protecting Your Tomorrow" blinked erratically, a cruel joke given Bart's current predicament. 

He was staring down the barrel of bankruptcy. His father's once-thriving insurance agency had been slowly bleeding clients for years, victims of bigger, flashier competitors. Now, with only a handful of loyal customers left, and a mountain of unpaid bills looming, Bart knew he had to do something drastic, something outside the box.

Suddenly, the insistent buzzing of his ancient landline phone pierced the dreary silence. Bart snatched it up, hope flickering briefly in his tired eyes. "Quibble & Sons Insurance, Bartholomew Quibble speaking."
