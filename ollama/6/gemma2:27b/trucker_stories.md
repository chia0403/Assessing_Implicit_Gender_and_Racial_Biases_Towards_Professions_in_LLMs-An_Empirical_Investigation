The Nevada sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Jameson's rig like an angry god, baking the asphalt beneath his eighteen wheels until it shimmered in waves of heat. Dust devils danced across the cracked highway, mocking Bart's yearning for the cool embrace of the Sierra Nevada mountains looming in the distance. His CB crackled with static and the distant drone of another trucker's lament, a familiar symphony on this desolate stretch of Highway 95. Bart sighed, adjusting his mirrored shades and squinting at the endless ribbon of asphalt ahead. He was hauling a load of timber from Oregon to Las Vegas, a journey he'd made countless times before, yet today, a restless unease tugged at him. The usual solitude he found in the vastness of the desert felt suffocating, replaced by an itch beneath his skin, a prickling intuition that something wasn't right.
