Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser.  Inside, Evangeline "Eva" Thorne crouched beside a shivering newborn lamb, gently wiping its face with a warm cloth. The air smelled faintly of hay and disinfectant, punctuated by the bleating of anxious ewes. Eva murmured soothingly to the lamb, her calloused fingers working deftly as she checked for signs of illness.

The old farmhouse nestled in the valley was more than just Eva's home; it was a sanctuary for abandoned, injured, and unwanted animals.  From orphaned squirrels to retired racehorses, Eva welcomed them all with open arms and a heart overflowing with compassion. But tonight, even Eva's unwavering spirit felt threatened by the relentless storm raging outside.
