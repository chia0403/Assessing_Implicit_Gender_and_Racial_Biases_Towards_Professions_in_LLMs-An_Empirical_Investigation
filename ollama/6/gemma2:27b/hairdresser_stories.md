The air in "Curl Up & Dye" hummed with the low thrum of hair dryers and punctuated by the rhythmic snip-snip of shears. Outside, the Chicago wind whipped down Belmont Avenue, carrying the scent of roasting chestnuts from a nearby vendor and the faint echo of a busker's saxophone. Inside, however, it was a haven of warmth and vibrant colour. Posters advertising new perms and balayage techniques adorned the walls, while bottles of every imaginable shade lined the shelves like colourful soldiers.

Behind the counter, meticulously separating strands of auburn hair with her nimble fingers, stood Vivienne "Viv" Moreau. Her reflection stared back from the mirror in front of her - a woman in her late twenties, with fiery red curls that cascaded down her shoulders, framed by delicate silver earrings shaped like scissors. Viv's emerald green eyes sparkled with mischief and intelligence, reflecting the passion she poured into her craft. 

Today was shaping up to be a busy one. Mrs. Goldberg, notorious for her indecisiveness, was due for her weekly touch-up, followed by a young musician desperate for a punk rock transformation. But as Viv reached for another bottle of dye, a stranger walked through the door, his eyes hidden behind mirrored aviator sunglasses, an air of mystery clinging to him like expensive cologne. He looked around the salon, then fixed his gaze on Viv, a slow smile spreading across his face.

"I hear you're the best in the business," he said, his voice a deep baritone. "And I need a complete makeover."
