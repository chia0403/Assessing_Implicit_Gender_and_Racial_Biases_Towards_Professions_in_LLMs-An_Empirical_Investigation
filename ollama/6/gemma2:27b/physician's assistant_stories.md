The insistent thrumming of cicadas filled the humid Louisiana air, punctuated by the occasional croak of a bullfrog from the murky bayou behind Eliza Fontaine's clinic. It was barely dawn, but already the heat promised to be oppressive. Sweat beaded on Eliza's forehead as she unlocked the door, the rusty hinges groaning in protest. Inside, the air hung thick and still, smelling faintly of antiseptic and old paper.

Eliza, a physician assistant with eyes as blue as the Louisiana sky after a summer storm and a no-nonsense braid that snaked down her back, flipped on the lights, bathing the small waiting room in a sterile glow. She had inherited the clinic from her grandfather, Dr. Etienne Fontaine, a beloved figure who'd treated generations of bayou folk. Eliza was determined to carry on his legacy, bringing quality healthcare to this isolated community despite its challenges.  

Today, however, she wasn’t feeling quite up to it. The phone call last night – the one about her brother's arrest for a crime he swore he didn't commit – hung over her like a dark cloud. Eliza needed to believe him, but doubt gnawed at the edges of her faith. How could her gentle, bookish brother be caught up in something so dangerous?
