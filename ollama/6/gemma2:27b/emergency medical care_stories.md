Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the already fading streetlights into hazy orbs. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Santiago gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. Sirens wailed a mournful song through the deluge, their sound swallowed by the howling wind.  

The call had come in just minutes ago: multiple car pileup on Highway 10, four confirmed injured. Amy's stomach churned with a familiar mix of adrenaline and dread. Every call was different, every patient unique, but the underlying thread remained the same - the desperate hope to arrive in time, to make a difference against the relentless tide of injury and pain.

Tonight, Highway 10 stretched before her like a dark ribbon, slick and treacherous. The rain seemed to intensify as she neared the accident site, the flashing red and blue lights ahead casting grotesque shadows on the asphalt. Amy took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever awaited them in the storm-swept chaos.
