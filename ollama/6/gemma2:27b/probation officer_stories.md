Rain hammered against Evelyn Price's windshield, blurring the neon glow of "Benny's Burgers" into an impressionistic smear. The diner was perched precariously on a hill overlooking the rust-belt town of Harmony Ridge, its flickering sign promising greasy solace in a world seemingly devoid of it. Evelyn sighed, running a hand through her damp curls. Another late night check-in, another potentially volatile situation.

Harmony Ridge wasn't known for its sunshine and roses. It was a town clinging desperately to its industrial past, riddled with unemployment, addiction, and the ever-present specter of despair. As a probation officer, Evelyn saw the fallout every day: broken families, shattered dreams, and lives teetering on the brink. Tonight's assignment was no exception.

She was headed to meet Marcus Delacroix, a young man recently released from prison for aggravated assault. His file was thick with red flags â€“ a history of violence, substance abuse, and an alarming disregard for authority. Evelyn knew this meeting could go either way: a productive conversation or a scene straight out of one of Harmony Ridge's many police reports. 


Taking another deep breath, Evelyn pulled into Benny's lot, the headlights illuminating the peeling paint and cracked asphalt. The diner door creaked open as she stepped inside, the smell of frying onions and stale coffee hitting her like a wall.  Marcus was waiting for her, hunched over a booth in the back corner, his face shrouded in shadow. Evelyn steeled herself, knowing this was just the beginning of a long, uncertain night.
