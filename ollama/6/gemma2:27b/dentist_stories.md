Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's dental practice, blurring the neon sign outside into an indistinguishable smear of pink and green. The rhythmic drumming was almost comforting, masking the incessant hum of anxiety that throbbed behind Elias's own temples. He stared at the clock on the wall, its hands mockingly inching towards five o'clock.

His office, usually a haven of antiseptic calm, felt claustrophobic today. The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of disinfectant and a lingering sweetness from yesterday's patient who'd insisted on bringing him homemade cinnamon rolls (delicious, but undeniably guilt-inducing). Elias sighed, pushing away the half-eaten plate on his desk.

He wasn't afraid of teeth, nor was he unnerved by the occasional shriek or whimper. It was the silence, the echoing emptiness of the waiting room that gnawed at him. Today marked a year since Dr. Thorne had inherited this practice from his beloved mentor, Dr. Henry Lawson. A year since Henry, with his booming laugh and reassuring hand on your shoulder, had passed away, leaving Elias to fill shoes far too large for his own nervous feet. 


Let me know if you'd like to continue the story! I can explore what happens when a patient walks in, or delve into Elias's backstory and anxieties about running the practice.
