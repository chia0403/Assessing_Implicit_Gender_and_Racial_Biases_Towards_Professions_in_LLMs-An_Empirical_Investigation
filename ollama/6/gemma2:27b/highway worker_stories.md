The sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's neck, turning his skin the color of sunbaked clay. Sweat stung his eyes as he wrestled with the rusted bolts on the guardrail, each groan and creak of metal echoing through the empty stretch of Nevada desert highway. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking him with their freedom. Silas longed to join them, to spin away from this endless monotony, but duty – a stubborn mule wearing a hardhat – kept him tethered to his post.
