Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Beatrice Blackwood's cubicle, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound that mirrored the chaos brewing inside her chest. Outside, the neon glow of "Used Cars Galore" flickered ominously, casting long, distorted shadows across the deserted lot.  Beatrice chewed on her thumbnail, the chipped polish reflecting the harsh fluorescent light overhead. Another hour and she'd be free from this soul-crushing job, but for now, the phone sat silent on her desk, a mocking reminder of her dismal sales figures.

This month had been brutal. Between the economic downturn and the arrival of a flashy new dealership across the street, customers were scarce as hens' teeth. Beatrice needed to make one more sale, just one, to hit her quota and avoid the dreaded "performance review" with Mr. Henderson, a man whose smile was as genuine as a three-dollar bill.

She glanced at the clock again: 5:48 pm. Just twelve minutes left. Maybe she should call it a night, cut her losses, and drown her sorrows in a triple scoop of salted caramel ice cream. But Beatrice Blackwood wasn't a quitter. She was a salesperson, dammit, and salespeople fought tooth and nail for every last deal.
