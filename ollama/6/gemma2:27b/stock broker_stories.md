Rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Alistair Finch's corner office, blurring the dizzying cityscape into a watercolour mess. The air crackled with static electricity, mirroring the tension in Alistair's gut. His phone buzzed relentlessly on his mahogany desk – calls from panicked clients, frantic analysts, and the perpetually icy voicemails from his superiors at Goldman Sachs.

Alistair Finch, a man who prided himself on composure, felt the sweat prickling under his starched collar. The Dow was plummeting faster than a skydiver without a parachute, and Alistair's meticulously constructed portfolio, once a gleaming testament to his prowess, was crumbling like sandcastles in a storm surge.

He knew this day was coming. Every market veteran whispered tales of the inevitable crash, but nobody could predict its timing or ferocity. Now, amidst the swirling chaos of flickering screens and frantic trading, Alistair faced a reckoning – not just for his clients, but for himself. Would he weather this storm, emerge stronger on the other side? Or would he drown in the turbulent sea of red ink that threatened to engulf him?
