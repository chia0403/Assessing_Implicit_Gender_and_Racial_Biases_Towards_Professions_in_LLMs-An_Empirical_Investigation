The July sun beat down on Savannah's cobblestone streets, turning the air thick and syrupy. Sweat prickled Amelia Winthrop's brow as she navigated the uneven path towards her latest listing. This charming, but decidedly dilapidated, Victorian mansion was tucked away in a quiet corner of the historic district, its faded grandeur barely peeking through layers of peeling paint and overgrown wisteria.

Amelia, with her fiery red hair perpetually escaping its bun and an infectious grin that could charm even the grumpiest homeowner, wasn't fazed by the home's condition. In fact, she saw potential everywhere: the intricate gingerbread trim begging for restoration, the dusty bay windows promising breathtaking views of Forsyth Park, the overgrown garden yearning for a burst of vibrant color. This house, with its history whispering through every crooked floorboard, held a story waiting to be told. 

Today, Amelia hoped to tell that story to a young couple, fresh-faced and eager, who were searching for their dream home in Savannah's heart. But as she approached the weathered front door, a sense of unease prickled her skin. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the rustle of leaves and the distant clang of a trolley bell.
