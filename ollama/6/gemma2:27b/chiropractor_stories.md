Rain lashed against the frosted glass windowpane, blurring the neon glow of "The Spine Whisperer" sign outside. Inside, Dr. Elias Finch adjusted his spectacles, peering over them at the X-ray image glowing on his monitor. His brow furrowed as he traced the misaligned vertebrae with a gnarled fingertip. This wasn't just a simple case of whiplash – there was something deeper, more unsettling about Mrs. Hathaway's injury.

Elias's office, tucked away in a quiet corner of Asheville, North Carolina, felt like a refuge from the storm raging outside. The scent of sandalwood incense mingled with the earthy aroma of dried herbs he used for his signature aromatherapy adjustments.  Old wooden beams crisscrossed the ceiling, and shelves overflowed with antique anatomical charts and well-thumbed texts on holistic healing. 

But despite the calming atmosphere, Elias felt a growing unease. Mrs. Hathaway's injury was unusual, almost... unnatural. And then there were her cryptic words about "shadows following" her and "bones whispering secrets."  Elias dismissed them initially as anxieties stemming from the accident, but now he wasn't so sure.

The insistent buzz of his phone shattered the silence. He glanced at the caller ID – an unfamiliar number. Hesitantly, he answered.
