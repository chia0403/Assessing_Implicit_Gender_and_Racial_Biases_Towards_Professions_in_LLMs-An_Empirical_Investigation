The musty scent of old velvet and sawdust hung thick in the air of the Grand Blackwood Theatre, clinging to Evangeline Hawthorne like a second skin. Moonlight filtered through the grime-coated windows, casting long shadows across the cavernous stage where dust motes danced in an ethereal waltz. Evangeline, her fiery red hair pulled back in a severe bun, paced before the dilapidated proscenium arch, her brow furrowed with concern. 

The Grand Blackwood was more than just a theatre; it was a relic of a bygone era, its grandeur fading with each passing year. Evangeline, driven by a relentless passion for the dramatic arts and an unshakeable belief in the theatre's potential, had poured her heart and soul into its revival. But tonight, doubt gnawed at her. The opening night of "The Tempest" loomed just hours away, and disaster seemed to be lurking around every corner.

The lead actor had fallen ill with a nasty case of stage fright, the lighting rig was threatening to collapse under its own weight, and the orchestra hadn't shown up for their final rehearsal. Evangeline took a deep breath, forcing herself to channel the unwavering spirit of Shakespeare himself. She wouldn't let the Grand Blackwood fall prey to misfortune. Not tonight. Not ever.
