The air hung thick with the scent of simmering tomatoes and roasting garlic, a familiar comfort to Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of her tiny kitchen in Seville, illuminating the chipped tiles and worn wooden countertop where she kneaded dough for her famous pan con tomate. Outside, the narrow cobblestone street hummed with the murmur of midday chatter, punctuated by the clatter of a nearby flamenco class.

Esme, her dark curls escaping from their braid and dusting her flour-dusted cheeks, paused in her rhythm. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, a feeling she hadn't experienced since she was a child listening to her abuela's stories of mythical creatures and hidden treasures. Today, the feeling was tinged with something else â€“ anticipation, perhaps? Or maybe just the heat playing tricks on her senses.  


Whatever it was, Esme knew one thing for sure: today was going to be anything but ordinary.
