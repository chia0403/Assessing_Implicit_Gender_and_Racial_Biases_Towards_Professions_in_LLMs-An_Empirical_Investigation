The smell of disinfectant always clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like an unwelcome perfume, even after she'd scrubbed her hands raw and changed out of her uniform. It was a constant reminder of her life: vibrant chaos punctuated by the sweet scent of baby powder and the slightly sour tang of spilled juice. Today, however, the usual aroma was overwhelmed by something else - a sharp metallic scent that prickled Amelia's nose hairs and set her stomach churning.

It was coming from the playroom, specifically from behind the brightly painted wooden easel where little Lily normally unleashed her artistic fury with crayons.  Amelia hesitantly approached, each step echoing strangely loud in the sudden silence of the daycare. The afternoon sun streamed through the window, casting long shadows across the scattered toys and miniature furniture. But something was wrong. Terribly wrong. 

Lily wasn't there, nor were any of the other children Amelia cared for. Only a single crimson stain marred the pristine white canvas on the easel, spreading like a malevolent flower bloom.
