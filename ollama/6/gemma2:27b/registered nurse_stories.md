Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy Hospital, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display against the grimy glass. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the bustling emergency room.  Eleanor Rose Davies, her auburn braid whipping around her shoulders as she hurried between patients, felt the familiar tension knotting in her stomach.

It was a full moon tonight, and everyone knew what that meant.


The ER always saw a surge in bizarre cases on nights like these – everything from inexplicable rashes to sudden fits of uncontrollable laughter. Eleanor wasn’t superstitious, but years of experience had taught her that the human mind was capable of extraordinary things, especially when fueled by moonlight and adrenaline. 

Tonight, though, something felt different.  A prickling sensation danced along her skin, a premonition she couldn't quite place. As she wheeled a gurney towards Room 3, she caught a glimpse of her reflection in the polished steel – tired eyes framed by dark circles, a faint smear of blood on her scrubs. She was weary, but duty called.

Eleanor pushed open the door and braced herself for whatever awaited her inside.
