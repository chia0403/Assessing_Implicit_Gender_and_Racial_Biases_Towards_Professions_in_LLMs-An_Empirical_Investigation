The recycled air hummed a low, constant drone in Amelia Kensington's ear.  It always seemed to carry the faint scent of almonds and old perfume, a peculiar combination that she'd come to associate with 30,000 feet. Outside, the sun was setting over a vast, cloud-strewn ocean, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and purple. Amelia gazed out at the spectacle, momentarily forgetting the cramped galley behind her where trays clattered against stainless steel and passengers grumbled about lukewarm coffee.

This flight, from Tokyo to Los Angeles, was already shaping up to be one for the books. A group of boisterous college students occupied the rear seats, their excitement bubbling over like a shaken champagne bottle. An elderly couple in first class seemed perpetually on the verge of a marital spat. And somewhere in economy, a baby was wailing with the kind of piercing intensity that could melt steel.

Amelia sighed. Another day, another flight. Yet, despite the chaos and the mundane routine, she couldn't help but feel a thrill every time the plane lifted off the ground. It was a feeling of freedom, of escaping the ordinary and soaring above the world's problems.
