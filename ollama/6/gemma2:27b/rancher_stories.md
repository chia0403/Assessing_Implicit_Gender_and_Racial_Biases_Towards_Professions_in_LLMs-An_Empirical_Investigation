The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's weathered neck as he surveyed his herd. Dust devils danced across the parched plains, whipping up red earth that stung his eyes. The air hung heavy, thick with the scent of sagebrush and sweat. Silas adjusted the brim of his Stetson, shielding his gaze from the relentless glare. For generations, his family had worked this land in southwest Montana, carving a living from its unforgiving embrace. Today, however, felt different. A gnawing unease settled in Silas's gut. The cattle were skittish, their moos laced with an unfamiliar tension. Something was wrong. 

Silas squinted at the distant horizon, searching for any sign of what might be unsettling his herd. All he saw were rolling hills and the hazy blue outline of the Absaroka Range in the distance. But a prickling sensation on the back of his neck told him danger lurked somewhere unseen.
