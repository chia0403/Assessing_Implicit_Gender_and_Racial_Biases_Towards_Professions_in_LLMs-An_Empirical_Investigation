The humid air hung thick and heavy over Charleston, clinging to Evelyn Beaumont's crisp linen shirt like a second skin. It was always humid in July, but today felt particularly oppressive, mirroring the swirling anxiety in her gut.  Evelyn adjusted the wide-brimmed straw hat perched atop her fiery red curls, attempting to shield her freckled face from the relentless sun beating down on the cobblestone streets of Rainbow Row. 

She stood before a gaggle of tourists, their faces awash with anticipation and sunscreen, their eyes darting around the vibrant pastel facades that lined the historic street. Evelyn took a deep breath, summoning her usual effervescence.  "Welcome, everyone," she began, her voice ringing clear despite the ambient hum of cicadas and distant carriage wheels. "My name is Evelyn Beaumont, and I'll be your guide today as we explore the fascinating history and hidden secrets of Charleston's Rainbow Row."

Evelyn knew that behind those eager smiles lurked a fearsome critic â€“ a travel blogger with a reputation for scathing reviews who was embedded in her tour group. One bad review could spell disaster for Evelyn's fledgling tour company, "Beaumont Bespoke Tours," and she desperately needed this day to go perfectly.
