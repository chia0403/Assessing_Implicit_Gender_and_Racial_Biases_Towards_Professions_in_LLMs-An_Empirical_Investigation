Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Finnigan's workshop, each drop a staccato beat in the symphony of the storm. The air hung heavy with the scent of ozone and damp earth. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, hunched over a tangle of wires on his workbench. Grease stained his hands, testament to years spent wrestling recalcitrant appliances back into submission.  His calloused fingers danced across the copper strands, testing connections and muttering under his breath about faulty capacitors and short circuits.

Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, threatening to rip the rusted tin roof from its moorings. Elias paused, listening intently. It wasn't just the storm raging outside; there was another sound, faint but distinct â€“ a rhythmic thumping coming from the alley behind his shop. He wiped his hands on a rag, curiosity outweighing his apprehension. He grabbed his trusty old flashlight and stepped out into the deluge.
