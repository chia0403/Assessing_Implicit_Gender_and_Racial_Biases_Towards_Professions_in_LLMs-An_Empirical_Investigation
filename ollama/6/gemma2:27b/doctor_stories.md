Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Amelia Blackwood's already frayed nerves. The wind howled like a banshee outside, its icy fingers clawing at the gaps in the wooden walls. Inside, the single kerosene lamp cast dancing shadows on the dirt floor, illuminating the worn-out medical charts and the dusty bottles of tinctures lining the shelves.  Amelia sighed, her breath fogging the air already thick with the smell of antiseptic and damp earth. 

The remote village of Akita nestled deep in the Himalayas was a world away from the sterile operating rooms and cutting-edge technology she'd known in London. Here, she relied on intuition, herbal remedies passed down through generations, and her own dwindling supply of antibiotics. Tonight, though, it felt like even that wasn't enough.

A cough, harsh and wet, broke the silence.  Amelia turned to see Tenzing, a young shepherd boy with wide, frightened eyes, clutching his chest. He was pale, his skin clammy, and his breathing laboured. The familiar pang of dread twisted in Amelia's gut.  This wasn't just another cold. This was something far worse.
