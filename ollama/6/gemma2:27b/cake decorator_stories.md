The humid Georgia air hung thick as icing sugar, clinging to Eleanor Grace Beaumont's apron and frosting her brow with beads of sweat.  She stood in the back room of "Beaumont's Baked Bliss," the aroma of vanilla and almond swirling around her like a sweet perfume. Sunlight streamed through the bakery window, catching the glittering dust motes dancing above her workbench. Eleanor hummed along to the radio, her fingers working with practiced precision as she sculpted delicate roses from buttercream frosting.

Today was a big day. A three-tiered masterpiece for Mrs. Henderson's daughter's wedding â€“ ivory fondant adorned with cascading sugar orchids and a cascade of hand-painted butterflies. Every detail mattered, every petal had to be perfect. Eleanor took a step back, her eyes critical, searching for any imperfections in the delicate floral arrangement. 


This was more than just a job for Eleanor; it was an art form. She poured her heart and soul into each creation, transforming simple cakes into edible masterpieces that celebrated life's sweetest moments. But lately, something felt off. A sense of unease had settled over Eleanor, like a bad batch of dough left to rise too long.
