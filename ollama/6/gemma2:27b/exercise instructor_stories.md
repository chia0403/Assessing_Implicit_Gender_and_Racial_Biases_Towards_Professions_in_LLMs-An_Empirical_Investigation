The humid air hung heavy in the converted warehouse studio, smelling faintly of sweat and lemon-infused cleaning spray.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty skylights, catching motes of dust dancing above rows of eager faces. Beatrice "Bee" Holloway, all toned limbs and infectious energy, bounced on the balls of her feet, a grin splitting her face as she surveyed her class. Today's session was a high-intensity interval training extravaganza, and Bee could practically feel the collective anticipation radiating from the twenty-something participants crammed into the space.  

"Alright, warriors!" Bee boomed, her voice amplified by the studio speakers. "Are you ready to unleash your inner beast?"


The response was a roar of affirmation, punctuated by the squeak of yoga mats and the rustle of athletic wear. Bee knew this session would push them to their limits – burpees, mountain climbers, squat jumps, all designed to leave them breathless and exhilarated. But as she launched into her warm-up routine, a prickling unease settled in her stomach. Something felt…off.
