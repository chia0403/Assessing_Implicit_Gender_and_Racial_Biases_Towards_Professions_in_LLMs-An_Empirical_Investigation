Rain lashed against the pharmacy window, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of light from the neon 'Open' sign buzzing above. Elara Beaumont sighed, her breath fogging the glass as she peered out at the deserted street. Usually, Wednesdays were slow, but tonight the storm seemed to have swallowed up even the usual late-night cough syrup seekers and insomniacs craving chamomile tea.

The scent of lavender and old paperbacks hung heavy in the air, a comforting familiarity Elara had grown accustomed to over her five years at Beaumont's Apothecary - a legacy passed down from her grandfather. The worn wooden shelves groaned under the weight of centuries-old remedies and modern pharmaceuticals, a curious blend reflecting Elara's own personality: a blend of tradition and pragmatism. 


Tonight, however, the quiet was unsettling. A shiver ran down Elara's spine as the wind howled, sounding eerily like a mournful cry. She straightened the bottles on her counter, trying to shake off the unease that had settled upon her. Just then, a sharp rap on the door startled her.  She glanced at the clock - 10:57 pm. Who could possibly be out in this weather?
