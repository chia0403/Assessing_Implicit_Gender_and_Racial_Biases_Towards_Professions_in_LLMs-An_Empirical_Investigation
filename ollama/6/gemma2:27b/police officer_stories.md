Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the precinct's interrogation room, mirroring the storm brewing inside Detective Isabella "Izzy" Reyes. She stared at the suspect across the steel table – a young man with eyes too old for his face and a tremor in his hands that betrayed his forced calm. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. 

Izzy's knuckles whitened as she gripped the file folder, the paper thin and worn from repeated readings. Three weeks. Three agonizing weeks since the discovery of Maria Cortez, her body sprawled on the cobblestones of Little Havana like a discarded doll. Three weeks of dead ends and whispered rumors in this labyrinthine city where secrets festered beneath the vibrant veneer. 

This kid, Carlos Hernandez, had been hanging around the victim's apartment building. Witnesses placed him there. But he swore he was innocent, claiming only to have admired Maria from afar. Izzy wasn't convinced. There was something in his gaze – a flicker of fear, perhaps guilt – that whispered louder than his hollow denials.  

Miami pulsed outside the window, a neon-drenched symphony of salsa rhythms and honking horns. But inside this concrete cell, time stood still. Izzy knew she had to break through Carlos's facade. To unravel the truth buried beneath layers of lies, fear, and the suffocating humidity of a Miami summer night.
