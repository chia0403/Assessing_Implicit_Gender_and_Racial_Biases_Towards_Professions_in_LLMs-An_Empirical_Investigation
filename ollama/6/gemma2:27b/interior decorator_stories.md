Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elsie Beaumont's cramped studio apartment, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  She glared at the crumpled fabric swatches scattered across her table like fallen autumn leaves, each one representing another failed attempt to charm the notoriously picky Mrs. Vandermeer. Elsie had poured weeks into this project, redesigning the drawing room of the Vandermeer mansion - a cavernous space echoing with whispers of faded grandeur and suffocating under layers of dusty velvet and baroque excess.

But Mrs. Vandermeer, a woman whose veins likely ran with ice instead of blood, remained unimpressed.  Elsie, usually brimming with creative energy, felt her inspiration drying up like the last drops of sun on a winter's day. This project, once a beacon of hope in her fledgling career, now threatened to consume her entirely.
