The pungent aroma of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office. Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, painted stripes across the worn rug and cluttered desk piled high with case files. Outside, the cacophony of a suburban high school pulsed: lockers slamming, distant laughter echoing down hallways, the shrill bleating of the dismissal bell. Eleanor sighed, pushing aside a file labelled "Ethan Miller - Persistent Truancy" to focus on the young girl sitting across from her. 

Maya Ramirez, all knobby knees and wide, wary eyes, fidgeted in her chair. She clutched a well-worn teddy bear, its fur matted and one ear flopping at an odd angle. Her silence was as heavy as the air itself, broken only by the occasional sniffle. Eleanor knew Maya wouldn't speak easily; she had seen too much pain reflected in those brown eyes already.

Today was the day Eleanor hoped to finally break through Maya's guarded shell. It was a day she'd been anticipating with equal parts dread and determination.
