The air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary, a pungent perfume unique to Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood's shop.  Dawn was just beginning to blush over the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, painting the windows of Bart's Butcher Shop a rosy hue. Inside, the chill of the early morning clung to the polished marble counters, contrasting sharply with the warmth emanating from the enormous brick oven in the corner. It was there, nestled amongst the flickering flames, that Bart labored. 

He wasn't just any butcher; Bart was an artist. His cleaver danced across the slabs of beef and pork with a surgeon's precision, his calloused hands transforming rough cuts into culinary masterpieces. Today, he wrestled with a magnificent boar, its crimson flesh glistening under the dim lantern light. The rhythmic thud of his cleaver against bone was a symphony Bart knew by heart, a familiar comfort in the quiet solitude before the town awoke.
