The insistent chime of the doorbell echoed through the cavernous lobby of The Grand Blackwood, its melody as familiar to Eleanor Beatrice Finch as her own heartbeat. A shiver danced down her spine despite the opulent warmth radiating from the antique fireplace. It was past midnight, a time when even the most demanding guests usually surrendered to slumber. Yet, here it was again - the insistent call, begging for Eleanor's attention.

Eleanor straightened her crisp crimson waistcoat, smoothing out any wrinkles with practiced precision. The Blackwood prided itself on its impeccable service, and she, its head concierge, was its unwavering guardian. Years of tending to whims both grand and mundane had honed her intuition to a razor's edge. This late-night visitor wasn't seeking extra pillows or room service; there was an urgency in that chime, a desperate plea veiled beneath the polished brass.

With a final glance at the deserted reception desk and the grandfather clock ticking ominously in the corner, Eleanor glided towards the heavy oak doors, her footsteps muffled by the thick Persian rug. Who dared disturb the Blackwood's tranquil slumber so late?
