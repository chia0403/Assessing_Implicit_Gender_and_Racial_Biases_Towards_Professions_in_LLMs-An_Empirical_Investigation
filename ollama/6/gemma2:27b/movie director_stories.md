The flickering neon sign of the "Last Chance Saloon" cast long, jagged shadows across the dusty street. It was a fitting backdrop for Elias Vance's current predicament. Elias, a man whose life had been a tapestry woven from celluloid dreams and Hollywood nights, now found himself adrift in the desolate heart of Nevada. His last film, a gritty noir set against the backdrop of 1940s Los Angeles, had flopped spectacularly, leaving him financially ruined and creatively bankrupt.

He pushed open the saloon doors, their rusty hinges groaning in protest. The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of stale beer. A handful of patrons hunched over chipped wooden tables, their faces obscured by shadows. Elias took a seat at the bar, the worn leather creaking beneath him.

"Whiskey," he mumbled to the bartender, his voice hoarse from disuse. "Make it a double."
