The fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Montgomery, casting a sterile white glow over the operating room. Beads of sweat clung to his brow despite the icy chill emanating from the air conditioning vent. His gloved hands moved with practiced precision, stitching together a ruptured spleen. The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor filled the silence, a steady counterpoint to the tense focus in the room.

Today, though, felt different. A knot of unease tightened in his stomach, a feeling he couldn't quite shake off.

Elias knew this was just another surgery, just another chance to mend what was broken. But something about Maya's youthful face, framed by dark curls, stirred an echo within him â€“ a memory of a time when he too believed in miracles.
