Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Reginald "Reggie" Fitzwilliam's cramped office, mimicking the drumming in his chest. April 15th was just two days away, and his desk was drowning in a sea of W-2s, 1099s, and receipts. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, punctuated by the occasional sigh escaping Reggie's lips. He adjusted his spectacles, his forehead creasing further as he stared at the bewildering array of numbers before him. This wasn't just any client; it was Mrs. Agatha Periwinkle, a notorious hoarder whose financial records were rumored to be more tangled than a bowl of spaghetti left out in a hurricane. Reggie rubbed his temples, wondering if this job was worth the constant headaches and existential dread that seemed to accompany tax season. 


The phone on his desk buzzed insistently, jolting him from his reverie. "Fitzwilliam Tax Services," he answered wearily, bracing himself for another panicked taxpayer on the verge of a meltdown. But the voice on the other end was different - smooth, confident, with an almost imperceptible hint of amusement.

"Mr. Fitzwilliam," it purred. "I believe you have something that belongs to me."
