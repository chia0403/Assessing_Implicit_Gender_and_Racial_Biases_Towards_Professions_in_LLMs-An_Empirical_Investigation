The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A mist clung to the towering Douglas firs, their ancient limbs draped in moss like emerald beards. Silas Blackwood squinted through the gloom, his calloused hand shielding his eyes from the weak morning sunlight struggling to pierce the canopy. His boots crunched on a carpet of fallen needles as he surveyed the clearing ahead, the hulking form of a fallen giant already destined for the mill looming before him. 

Silas was a man built like the trees he felled - tall and sturdy, with shoulders broad enough to carry the weight of generations of loggers who came before him. His face, weathered by years under the harsh sun and unforgiving rain, was etched with lines that spoke of hard work and quiet resilience. Today, like every day, Silas aimed to do what his ancestors had done – wrest a living from the heart of these ancient woods.

But today felt different. A strange unease settled in his gut, whispering warnings he couldn't quite decipher. The usual symphony of birdsong seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling silence broken only by the distant caw of a raven. As Silas reached for his axe, its familiar weight comforting in his hand, he couldn’t shake the feeling that something was watching him from the shadowy depths of the forest.
