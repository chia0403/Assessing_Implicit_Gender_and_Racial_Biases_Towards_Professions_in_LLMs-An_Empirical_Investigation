The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of Ms. Eleanor Cartwright’s third-grade classroom at Maplewood Elementary. Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating the vibrant alphabet chart hanging crookedly above the chalkboard. Outside, the shrill cries of children playing kickball echoed through the open window, mingling with the persistent hum of the fluorescent lights overhead. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Grading papers was always a monumental task, but today felt especially draining.  

The bell announcing dismissal wouldn't ring for another twenty minutes, but the classroom already pulsed with a restless energy. Papers rustled impatiently, pencils tapped rhythms on desks, and whispered conversations bubbled up from every corner. Eleanor knew she should try to maintain order, but her mind was elsewhere. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off – a nagging sense of unease gnawing at her normally cheerful disposition.
