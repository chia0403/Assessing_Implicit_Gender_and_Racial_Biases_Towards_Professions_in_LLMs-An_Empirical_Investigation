The scent of rain and old paper hung heavy in Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s attic office. Rain lashed against the warped shingles of the ancient Victorian house, its rhythm a counterpoint to the frantic tapping of Amelia’s fingers on her worn typewriter. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, shaking the windows in their frames. Inside, however, the air was still and thick with the concentration of a writer battling a deadline.

Amelia, a woman with wild auburn hair escaping its bun and eyes that shone with a mixture of frustration and inspiration, stared at the blank page before her. Her latest manuscript, a gothic horror novel set in the fog-shrouded streets of 19th-century London, was due to her publisher in two weeks. But the words weren’t coming. 

She had envisioned the story vividly -  a chilling tale of an ancient curse, a mysterious manor, and a young woman who stumbles upon a truth too terrifying to bear. Yet, now, faced with the blank page, the fearsome narrative seemed to have vanished like smoke in the wind.


The storm raged on, mimicking the turmoil within Amelia's own mind.  She needed inspiration, a spark, something to ignite the fire of her imagination and set the story ablaze once more.
