The air hung heavy with the scent of brine and iron in Elias Thorne's shop, "Thorne & Sons: Fine Meats."  It was a small space, tucked into the cobbled backstreets of Whitehaven, its weathered wooden sign barely visible beneath the encroaching ivy. Elias, his hands calloused and stained crimson, surveyed the dayâ€™s stock with a practiced eye. A glistening leg of lamb from Farmer McGregor's flock, plump sausages awaiting their final casing, and a hefty side of beef, still whispering tales of the pasture it once roamed.  

Elias wasn't just a butcher; he was an artist, crafting his edible masterpieces with precision and care. Every cut held a story, every bone a memory. He could tell you the life history of each animal that graced his counter, from their playful frolicking in spring meadows to their solemn quiet before slumber. 

But today, something felt different. A chill wind rustled through Whitehaven, carrying whispers of an impending storm. Elias glanced at the darkened sky, a premonition settling heavy in his gut. He knew this wasn't just about the weather. Something was coming, something dark and unsettling, that would change the rhythm of his life forever.
