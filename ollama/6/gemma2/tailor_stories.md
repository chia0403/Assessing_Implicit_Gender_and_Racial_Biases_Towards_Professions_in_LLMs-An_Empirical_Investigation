The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and cedarwood, a comforting aroma that clung to everything in Elias Thorne's small tailoring shop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the golden light that illuminated bolts of vibrant silk, tweed, and velvet lining the walls. A rhythmic whirring filled the air as Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, guided a needle expertly through a layer of fine linen. Outside, the bustling city of Veridian hummed with its usual chaotic symphony of carriage wheels clattering on cobblestones, vendors hawking their wares, and children's laughter echoing through the narrow streets. But within the walls of Elias' shop, time seemed to slow, each stitch a deliberate act, each thread a promise woven into existence. 


Veridian, known for its extravagant balls and opulent theatre productions, demanded perfection in attire. And Elias Thorne, with his deft hands and discerning eye for detail, was considered one of the city's most sought-after tailors.
