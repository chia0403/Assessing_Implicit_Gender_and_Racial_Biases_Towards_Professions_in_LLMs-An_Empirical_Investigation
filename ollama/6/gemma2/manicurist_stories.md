The rhythmic click of nail clippers was a counterpoint to the muffled roar of traffic outside "Tip Top Nails." Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of acetone and peppermint polish remover.  

Evelyn Bellerose, or Evie as her regulars knew her, carefully filed down a chipped ruby red nail, her brow furrowed in concentration. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air. A lone neon sign flickered outside, casting its magenta glow on the rows of neatly arranged bottles filled with an array of shimmering and pastel hues. 

Evie glanced at the clock: six-thirty. Just thirty minutes left before closing time. She hoped Mrs. Henderson wouldn't be late again. The elderly woman always ordered a simple French manicure, her voice a soft whisper as she recounted tales from her youth. Lately, those stories had become more frequent, more desperate, each one tinged with a palpable loneliness that tugged at Evie's heart. 


She looked up, wiping away a smudge of clear polish on her own nail. Maybe tonight, Mrs. Henderson would bring news about the new neighbor she'd been waiting for.  A spark of something like hope flickered within Evie, a tiny flame against the encroaching darkness outside and the ever-present humdrum of the city that threatened to swallow them both whole.
