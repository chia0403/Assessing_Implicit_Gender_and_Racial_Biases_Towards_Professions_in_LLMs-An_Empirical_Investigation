The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Dr. Eleanor Vance's cluttered office.  Dust motes danced in the pale light, swirling around overflowing bins of outdated assessment tools and half-finished reports. Outside her window, the autumn wind howled through the bare branches of an ancient oak, its mournful creak mirroring the unease churning in Eleanor's stomach. 

It was a Tuesday, which meant group therapy for the emotionally disturbed students - a motley crew of anxious whispers, defiant glares, and silent stares, all masking their own private struggles. Today, however, felt different.  A palpable tension hung in the air, an unspoken question simmering beneath the surface. Eleanor could sense it â€“ something was about to break.

She took a deep breath, smoothing down her cardigan as she prepared for another session. This time, however, she wasn't just trying to mend broken spirits. She was facing a storm of her own, a personal darkness threatening to engulf her world. And the troubled children huddled before her might be the only ones who could help her navigate it.
