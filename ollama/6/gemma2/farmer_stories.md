The dust swirled around Elias Thorne's boots as he surveyed his parched field. A wind, hot and dry as a blacksmithâ€™s forge, whipped through the withered stalks of corn, their leaves crackling like brittle bones underfoot.  

Elias ran a calloused hand over his sun-weathered face, squinting at the horizon. It stretched out before him like a cracked, dusty canvas, unbroken except for the distant silhouette of the old abandoned windmill, its sails long since succumbed to the relentless Kansas wind. The setting sun bled across it, painting the sky in hues of bruised plum and dying embers. 

This was his land, inherited from generations past. A legacy he desperately clung to, even as the unforgiving earth seemed determined to swallow it whole. This year, the drought had come early, fierce and relentless. The once fertile soil felt like powder beneath his feet, a stark reminder of the precarious life Elias led, teetering on the edge of ruin. 


He sighed, a sound swallowed by the vast emptiness around him.  It was going to be a long, hard summer.
