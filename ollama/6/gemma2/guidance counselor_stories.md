The fluorescent lights of Willow Creek High hummed a tired lullaby over the empty hallway.  Dust motes danced in the pale beams slicing through the blinds. Eleanor Violet Thorne sighed, pushing her glasses further up her nose as she surveyed the scene. Her desk, usually a battlefield of scattered papers and half-finished career aptitude tests, was miraculously tidy – a testament to the fact that it was 7:30 on a Saturday morning, and Mrs. Thorne was the only soul in the building besides the janitorial staff.

She wasn’t supposed to be here. She had promised herself a day of blissful solitude at the farmers market, followed by a leisurely afternoon spent reading in her sun-drenched garden. But a frantic email from Principal Jackson, begging for her “guidance and wisdom,” had pulled her back into the familiar vortex of teenage angst. The subject line: "Possible Crisis – Ethan Pierce." 


Ethan Pierce was a senior, bright as a star but plagued by crippling anxiety.  He’d always been a quiet kid, drifting through the halls like a wisp of smoke. Mrs. Thorne had watched him blossom this year, finally finding his voice in their drama club's production of "Hamlet," only for it all to crumble last week with a sudden withdrawal and alarming silence. 

Now, perched on the edge of her chair, a cup of lukewarm coffee forgotten beside her, Eleanor Violet Thorne felt the weight of Ethan’s crisis settle on her shoulders like a leaden cloak. He needed her. And despite her better judgment, Mrs. Thorne knew she wouldn't disappoint him.
