The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and saltwater as Esmeralda Willowbrook adjusted her straw sunhat, a wide smile plastered on her face despite the relentless July heat.  Sweat prickled at her hairline, but she refused to let it dampen her enthusiasm. This was Naples, after all, a city that hummed with life even in the midday sun. 

Esmeralda, known affectionately as "Esme" by her regulars, surveyed her small group of tourists huddled around her, their faces a mixture of awe and bewilderment. They were an eclectic bunch: a retired couple from Ohio clutching guidebooks, a boisterous family of six with sticky fingers and even stickier sunscreen, and a lone young man with headphones perpetually attached, taking sporadic glances at his phone before seemingly losing himself in the labyrinthine alleys.  

Todayâ€™s tour was all about Pompeii. Not the grand ruins themselves, those were covered in another day's itinerary, but the lesser-known history that breathed life into the stone. Esme, a descendant of Neapolitan immigrants herself, felt a deep connection to the city and its past. She wanted her visitors to see beyond the tourist attractions, to feel the pulse of Pompeii as if it still throbbed beneath their feet.  

"Alright everyone," Esme chirped, clapping her hands together, "let's get ready to step back in time!"


Her voice, a lilting melody laced with Neapolitan accent, carried over the chatter and the distant sounds of scooters weaving through the narrow streets. The alleyways, draped in colorful laundry and fragrant herbs, seemed to close in around them, transporting Esme and her tourists into a world both familiar and utterly foreign.  It was here, amidst the bustling energy of Naples, that the whispers of Pompeii began.
