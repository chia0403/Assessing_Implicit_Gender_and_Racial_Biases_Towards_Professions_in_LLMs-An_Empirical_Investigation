The scent of bay rum hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of sweat and soap. Arthur Percival Featherstonehaugh Jr., better known as "Archie" to his regulars, meticulously trimmed a customer's sideburns with a practiced hand. Outside, the London fog was starting to creep in, a grey shroud swallowing the cobblestone streets. It was always like this in November; damp, dreary, and perfect for hiding secrets.

Archie's barbershop, nestled on a quiet street off Baker Street, was a sanctuary from the city's bustle. Rich mahogany lined the walls, adorned with faded hunting prints and dusty medals, relics of a bygone era. A crackling fire roared in the hearth, casting flickering shadows that danced across the faces of his customers â€“ a motley crew of businessmen, artists, and the occasional eccentric. 

Archie wasn't just a barber; he was a confidante, a therapist, and sometimes even an unwitting detective. His shears knew more than they were supposed to. He had seen tears, confessions, and whispered plans within the confines of his shop, all while maintaining an air of quiet professionalism. This morning, however, something felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the fog outside. 


Archie's sixth sense, honed by years of observing human behavior, told him this was no ordinary Tuesday.
