The rain hammered against the windows of Mercy General, each drop a tiny drumbeat against the symphony of coughs and moans echoing through the bustling emergency room.  Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes, her green scrubs damp from the downpour she'd walked through to get to work, hunched over a gurney, calmly assessing a young woman with an alarmingly swollen ankle. 

Mercy General was a crucible, a melting pot of life and death, joy and despair. Located in the heart of Detroit, it bore the weight of the city's anxieties, its hopes, and its struggles. Ellie, despite her youth, had seen it all â€“ gunshot wounds, car accidents, broken hearts, and the slow creep of chronic illness. 

She was a lighthouse in this storm, her calm demeanor and steady hands offering a flicker of hope amidst the chaos.  Tonight, like every night, she held the line, ready to face whatever walked through those doors.  The rain kept falling, a relentless reminder that even in the face of adversity, life marched on.
