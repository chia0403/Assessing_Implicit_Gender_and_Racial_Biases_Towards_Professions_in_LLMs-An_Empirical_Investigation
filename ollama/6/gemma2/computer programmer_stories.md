The stale scent of instant ramen hung heavy in the air, mingling with the ozone tang of the overworked server fan whirring just behind Amelia "Amy" Grace's head. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, battling lines of code that refused to cooperate. Outside her window, the perpetually grey London sky bled into dusk, mirroring the encroaching despair within her own mind. 

This wasn't how she imagined it. Six months ago, Amy had landed her dream job at ByteForge, a leading tech startup known for its cutting-edge AI projects. She'd envisioned late nights fuelled by coffee and camaraderie, brainstorming revolutionary ideas that would change the world. Instead, she was stuck debugging a clunky chatbot named "Chirpy," whose only talent seemed to be misinterpreting user queries and sending out nonsensical replies. 

The flickering glow of her monitor illuminated Amy's tired face, highlighting the dark circles under her eyes. A sigh escaped her lips, mingling with the clatter of stray keyboard keys as she slammed her fist down in frustration. Chirpy, a digital gremlin unleashed upon an unsuspecting world, was going to be the death of her.
