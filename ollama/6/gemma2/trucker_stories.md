The rhythmic hum of the diesel engine was the lullaby that put Elias "Ace" Caldwell to sleep every night.  His Peterbilt 389, affectionately nicknamed "Blue Steel," wasn't just a truck; it was his home, his office, and his escape. He knew every creak of its frame, every rattle in the dashboard, like an old friend. Right now, Ace was rumbling across the barren plains of West Texas, the sun a searing eye in the cloudless sky.  The air shimmered with heat waves, distorting the horizon into a mirage of impossible landscapes.  A lone tumbleweed skittered across his path, a fleeting speck in the vast expanse of sand and scrub brush. Ace chewed on a piece of stale sunflower seeds, the grit clinging to his teeth. His CB crackled to life, a familiar voice breaking the silence. 

"Breaker breaker, Blue Steel. You readin' me?"


Ace smiled, already knowing who it was.  He gripped the mic and replied, "Loud and clear, Big Tex. What's shakin' in them dusty plains?"



The story is set against the backdrop of a cross-country trucking journey through the desolate beauty of the American West.
