The pungent scent of roasted garlic and rosemary hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's linen blouse like a stubborn fog. It was her favorite smell in the world, but today, it felt more like an unwelcome assault on her senses. She stood at the entrance of "Garlic & Greens," the trendy vegetarian cafe she’d been consulting with for the past six months, and wished she’d opted for the bland chicken broth her husband had brought for lunch. 

The cafe was a charming chaos of mismatched chairs, exposed brick walls adorned with hand-painted murals, and staff bustling around like caffeinated bees. Amelia surveyed the scene with a critical eye. The menu boasted kale smoothies, quinoa bowls, and avocado toasts – all beautifully presented, undeniably healthy, but possibly lacking in… well, flavor.  


This wasn't her usual clientele. Amelia prided herself on helping busy executives shed their stress-induced pounds, not crafting Instagram-worthy meals for the burgeoning health-conscious crowd. But the cafe’s owner, a charismatic woman named Iris with a penchant for dramatic pronouncements and even more dramatic salads, had convinced Amelia to take on the challenge. Today, she was supposed to meet with Iris to discuss their progress, a meeting Amelia dreaded with the ferocity of a food critic facing a burnt soufflé.
