The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin as she surveyed the dilapidated Victorian mansion. Spanish moss draped from its gabled roof like spectral fingers, and the porch swing creaked rhythmically in the breeze, sounding eerily like a whispered lullaby. 

Amelia adjusted her straw hat, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. This was her third attempt at selling "Whispering Pines" â€“ a notoriously haunted house perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the Atlantic. Most people wouldn't touch it with a ten-foot pole, but Amelia saw potential in its crumbling grandeur. 

Today's potential buyer, Mr. Alistair Finch, stood behind her, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed fedora. He was a renowned paranormal investigator, known for his skepticism and sharp wit. Amelia hoped he wouldn't be put off by the house's reputation.  She needed this sale, desperately.
