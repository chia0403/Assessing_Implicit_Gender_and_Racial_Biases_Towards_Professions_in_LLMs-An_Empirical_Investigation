The flickering neon sign outside "Dr. Amelia Rivers, Clinical Psychologist" cast an unsettling green glow on the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lemon disinfectant and stale anxiety. Dr. Rivers sat hunched over her desk, a mug of lukewarm tea growing cold beside her, its condensation leaving tiny rings on the worn wood.  She stared at the mess of notes before her – scribbled observations, fragmented dreams, half-formed theories – all swirling around the case that had her completely unravelled. It was Daniel Hawthorne, a young man claiming to see ghosts, and his story, far from being a simple delusion, felt deeply unsettlingly real. 


Amelia knew she needed answers. The city outside roared with its usual cacophony of sirens and honking horns, but in this quiet office, the only sound was the insistent ticking of the clock on her wall, each tick a reminder that time, as always, kept marching forward, relentless and indifferent to the unraveling world within those four walls.
