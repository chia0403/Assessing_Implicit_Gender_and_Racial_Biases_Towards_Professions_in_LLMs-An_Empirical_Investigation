The humid New Orleans air clung to Elias Beaumont like a second skin as he maneuvered his trolley through the bustling lobby of The Grand Magnolia Hotel. The polished marble floor gleamed under the ornate crystal chandeliers, reflecting the vibrant chatter of tourists and the clinking of champagne glasses from a nearby brunch gathering.  Elias navigated the crowd with practiced ease, his white gloves spotless despite the sticky heat. He was used to this â€“ the cacophony of the city seeping into the grand hotel, the constant swirl of life and laughter. But beneath the surface, Elias sensed a current of unease, a quiet murmur that things weren't quite as they seemed in The Grand Magnolia. 


He stopped at a table draped with a crimson tablecloth, a woman clutching a crumpled telegram and staring intently at the ornate clock ticking above the fireplace.  Elias knew her; Madame Evangeline, a renowned tarot reader who frequented The Grand Magnolia, often shrouded in an aura of mystery and whispered secrets. Her presence alone hinted that something was amiss.
