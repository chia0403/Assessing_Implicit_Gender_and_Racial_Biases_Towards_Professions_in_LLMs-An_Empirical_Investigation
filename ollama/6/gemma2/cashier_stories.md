The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of the "Dollar Deal" discount store.  Clara Evelyn Bellweather, or Ellie as everyone called her, tapped her foot impatiently against the linoleum floor. The afternoon lull was dragging on, punctuated only by the occasional cough from an elderly woman browsing the canned goods or the whirring of the automatic doors announcing a new customer.

Ellie dreamed of escaping this mundane existence. Her mind constantly wandered to faraway places - Parisian cafes overflowing with laughter, bustling Tokyo markets teeming with exotic smells and sounds, even just a quiet beach where she could listen to the waves crash against the shore. This cramped, dusty corner of suburbia felt miles away from anything remotely exciting. 


The bell above the door jangled, shattering Ellie's reverie. She straightened up, plastered on her best customer service smile, and prepared for another transaction in the seemingly endless cycle of discount merchandise and bored customers.
