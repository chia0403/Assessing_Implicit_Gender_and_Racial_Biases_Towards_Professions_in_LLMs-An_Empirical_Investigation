The scent of beeswax and lemon polish hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Eleanor Rose like a second skin. She hummed softly as she moved, her well-worn slippers whispering across the polished oak floors of Manor House. Sunbeams sliced through the high arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the silent rooms. Amelia had always found comfort in this routine: the predictable rhythm of scrubbing, dusting, polishing, a balm against the chaos that lurked just beyond these stately walls.  She knew every creak of the floorboards, every subtle shift in the light that cast shadows across the faded tapestry hanging above the grand fireplace. Manor House held its secrets close, whispers of forgotten laughter and hushed tragedies echoing through the halls. Amelia, with her gentle hands and watchful eyes, was privy to them all.


But today, a new scent drifted on the breeze: a metallic tang mingled with lavender.  It wasn't the usual aroma of fresh cut lilies that permeated the air when Lord Ashford held court.  This smell... this smell spoke of something different, something unsettling. 

Amelia paused, her hand hovering over the silver doorknob leading to the library. The whispers grew louder now, a chorus of anxieties swirling around her. Perhaps it was time she ventured beyond her familiar duties and peeked into the secrets of Manor House once more.
