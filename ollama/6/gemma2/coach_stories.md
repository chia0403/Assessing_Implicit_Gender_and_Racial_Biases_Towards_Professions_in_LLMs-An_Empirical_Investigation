The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of freshly cut grass.  Sunlight dripped through the towering oak trees that lined the edges of Field 5, casting dappled shadows on the worn asphalt where Amelia "Amy" Harper paced. The rhythmic thud of her running shoes against the concrete punctuated the quiet hum of cicadas buzzing in the summer heat. 

Amy surveyed the field. A scattering of kids, sweat-stained and panting, huddled under the makeshift shade offered by a weathered tarp. They were the Blue Jays, the junior high softball team Amy had been coaching for five years now. This wasn't the glamorous life she'd envisioned after college – the one filled with Division I glory and scouting reports whispered in hushed tones. But this, this was real. 

This was seeing the spark ignite in a girl’s eyes when she finally nailed a curveball. This was celebrating victory with a group of kids who were more like family. This was life, messy and unpredictable, but undeniably fulfilling. And for Amy Harper, head coach of the Blue Jays, that was enough.
