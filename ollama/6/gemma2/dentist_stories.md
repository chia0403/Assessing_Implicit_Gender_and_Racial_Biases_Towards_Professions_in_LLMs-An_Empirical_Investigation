The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and lavender oil in Dr. Eleanor Vance's office. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window depicting a toothy grin, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the pristine white linoleum floor. The gentle whir of the ultrasonic scaler was the only sound besides the occasional chirp of birds outside, a stark contrast to the cacophony that often erupted in her downtown practice. This small, seaside town had a different pace; even the anxieties seemed more mellow here.  

Eleanor adjusted her mirrored glasses and peered into the mouth of Mrs. Henderson, a sweet octogenarian with a penchant for cherry popsicles. "Just a little scraping around this wisdom tooth, Mrs. Henderson," she said softly, her voice soothing as ever. But beneath the calm facade, Eleanor couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that something was amiss. It wasn't just the faint metallic tang lingering in the air -  a scent distinctly uncharacteristic of her usual peppermint-scented space. 


No, it was a deeper unease, a prickle of anticipation that something unusual was about to occur in her tranquil haven.
