The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Ms. Amelia Winthrop's cluttered desk. She ran a hand through her already messy bun, sighing as she stared at the stack of graded essays threatening to topple over.  

It was 8:03 pm, and Amelia had been stuck in this purgatory – Mrs. Thompson’s empty classroom, smelling faintly of stale chalk and disinfectant – for almost two hours. The late afternoon sun was already a memory, replaced by the dull hum of the school's aging HVAC system. Outside, the town of Oakhaven was settling into its twilight routine, oblivious to Amelia's internal struggle against a mountain of adolescent angst manifested in poorly punctuated sentences and questionable arguments about Shakespeare. 

Amelia yearned for a hot shower, a cup of something stronger than chamomile tea, and the comforting silence that her apartment usually offered. But first, she had to conquer these essays – a daunting task for even the most dedicated English teacher, especially on a Friday night when all Amelia really wanted was to be anywhere else.
