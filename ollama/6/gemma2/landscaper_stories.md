The late summer sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Evergreen's neck, turning his already tanned skin a shade darker than the rich brown loam he was constantly kneading with his bare hands. Sweat dripped from his brow, mingling with the pollen clinging to the air in fragrant, suffocating clumps.  He wiped his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a greasy streak across his forehead.

Bart surveyed the sprawling lawn before him â€“ the Emerald Estate, a Victorian mansion perched precariously on a bluff overlooking the churning Atlantic. It was a job that demanded precision and patience, two virtues Bart possessed in spades. The previous landscaper had left a mess; overgrown rose bushes clawing at their wooden trellises, unruly hedges resembling prickly green monsters, and a lawn that resembled more of a patchwork quilt than a manicured expanse.  

Bart took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of salt air mingled with freshly cut grass and honeysuckle. This was his world: dirt under his nails, the weight of his tools in his hands, the symphony of birdsong amidst the rustle of leaves. This was where he felt alive.
