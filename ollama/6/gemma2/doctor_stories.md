The flickering neon sign cast an anemic glow across Dr. Evelyn Alistair's tired face. It read "Alistair's Apothecary & General Practice - Open 24 Hours," a promise more aspirational than realistic. The worn brick building sagged slightly under the weight of countless late nights and sleepless patients. A steady drizzle beat against the glass, blurring the street outside into a grey canvas. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender oil and antiseptic, a comforting blend that had become Evelyn's daily reality.

Evelyn sighed, massaging her temples. The past few days had been particularly grueling. Flu season had hit the small coastal town of Oakhaven harder than usual, leaving her practice overflowing with coughs, sniffles, and worried faces. Her own immune system seemed to be wobbling precariously on its last legs. 

A car horn blared outside, followed by a rapid knock at the door. Evelyn braced herself, knowing another desperate soul needed her help.  This wasn't just about dispensing medication anymore; it was about offering a semblance of hope in a town struggling to stay afloat amidst rising tides and dwindling dreams. It was about being the anchor in a storm that seemed to be engulfing them all.
