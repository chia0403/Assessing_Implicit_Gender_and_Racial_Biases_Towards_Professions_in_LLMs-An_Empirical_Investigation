The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Quillfeather's boots like cobwebs, dampening his usually cheerful mood. He squinted through the swirling grey as he surveyed the sprawling gardens of Abernathy Manor. Roses, normally bursting with vibrant hues, drooped listlessly under the gloomy sky. Even the meticulously trimmed hedges seemed to wear a frown. 

Bartholomew sighed. As the head groundskeeper for the manor, it was his duty to coax life back into this melancholy landscape. He adjusted the worn leather strap of his gardening tool belt and inhaled deeply, trying to find solace in the earthy scent that clung to the damp grass. Despite the dreary weather, he knew there was beauty to be found even amidst the gloom. Today, his mission was simple: bring a touch of sunshine back into Abernathy Manor's garden.
