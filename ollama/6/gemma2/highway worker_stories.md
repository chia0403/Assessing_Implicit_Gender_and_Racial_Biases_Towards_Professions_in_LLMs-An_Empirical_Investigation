The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Tucker's neck as he squinted at the shimmering asphalt ribbon ahead. It snaked across the Nevada desert like a giant metallic worm, disappearing into the haze that hung heavy over the horizon.  He wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his weathered face. Another scorcher in another endless stretch of baking earth.

Bart was a highway worker, part of a small crew responsible for maintaining this lonely artery through the heart of Nevada. His days were filled with the familiar rhythm of asphalt patching, weed-whackers buzzing, and the rumble of passing eighteen-wheelers that shook the ground beneath his boots. It wasn't glamorous, but it was honest work, and out here, in the vast silence of the desert, honesty felt like a rare commodity.  


Today, however, something felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, prickling at Bart's skin like static electricity. The usual symphony of engine roars and wind whistling through the sagebrush seemed muted, replaced by an unnerving hush. Even the vultures circling overhead appeared to be watching with a newfound intensity.  Bart couldnâ€™t shake the feeling that something was about to change, something big.
