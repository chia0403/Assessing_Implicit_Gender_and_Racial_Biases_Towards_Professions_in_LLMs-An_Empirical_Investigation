Rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office window, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her own heart. Seattle in April was always a gloomy affair, but today the grey sky seemed to press down with an oppressive weight, stealing even the meager sunlight that dared peek through the clouds. 

Eleanor stared at the file on her desk: "Thomas Hayes – anxiety and insomnia." Another case for another soul drowning in their own internal storm. She sighed, rubbing her temples.  The irony wasn't lost on her - a therapist battling her own demons of exhaustion and disillusionment. Lately, the weight of everyone else’s pain felt like an anchor dragging her down. 

She pushed the file aside, forcing herself to focus. A new day, another chance to make a difference. She straightened her spine, reminding herself why she’d chosen this path – to help people navigate their own storms, to offer a lighthouse in their darkest hours. 

The bell above the door chimed, and Eleanor turned, bracing herself for whatever storm was about to enter her office.
