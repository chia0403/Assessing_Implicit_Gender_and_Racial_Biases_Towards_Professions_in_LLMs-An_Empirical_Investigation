The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cobblestones of Lower Borough, illuminating only slivers of grime and damp. Rain hammered against Sergeant Alistair MacAllister’s trench coat, soaking through to his wool undershirt in an unwelcome chill. He hunched deeper into the collar, trying to ward off the cold as he patrolled the narrow alleyway between the Fishmonger’s Guild and the apothecary shop. 

Alistair wasn't a fan of nights like this. The darkness felt thicker, more oppressive. And tonight, it held an extra layer of unease - a prickling sensation on the back of his neck that whispered of unseen eyes watching him from the shadows.  


He pressed on, his boots splashing through puddles left by the unrelenting downpour. Above him, the sky was a bruised canvas of charcoal grey, promising more rain and perhaps even a storm. The scent of brine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the damp earth and the sickly sweet aroma of fermenting fish from the Guild just off to his left. 

Alistair tightened his grip on his truncheon, its worn wood comforting in his hand. It was a familiar weight, one he'd come to rely upon during the long shifts that kept him patrolling the city’s underbelly, a shield against whatever dangers lurked in the darkness.
