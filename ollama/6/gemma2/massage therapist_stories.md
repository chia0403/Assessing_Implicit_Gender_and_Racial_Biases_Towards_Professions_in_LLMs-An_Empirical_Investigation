The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a soothing balm against the tension that seemed to permeate everything outside Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne's small cottage-style therapy studio. Inside, Amy kneaded the knots out of her latest client's shoulders with practiced ease. The rhythmic creak of her client's bones, the gentle hiss of the diffuser, and the low hum of traffic from the nearby city seemed to blend into a calming white noise. 

But beneath the surface calm, Amy felt a prickle of unease. A strange sense of foreboding had settled upon her, like a shadow lengthening with the setting sun. She tried to ignore it, focusing on the warmth in her client's tense muscles and the way their breath eased with each passing touch. 

This was Oakhaven, a small town nestled amongst rolling hills and whispering pines, where life moved at a slower pace. Amy had come here seeking peace after years of bustling city life. Yet, lately, that peace felt increasingly fragile, like a thin sheet of ice about to crack under the weight of something unseen.  

As her client sighed contentedly, Amy knew she couldn't ignore the feeling any longer. The shadow was growing darker.
