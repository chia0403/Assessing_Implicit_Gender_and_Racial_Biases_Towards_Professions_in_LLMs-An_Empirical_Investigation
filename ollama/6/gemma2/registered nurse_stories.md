The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne, casting a sterile pallor over the Emergency Room.  A symphony of beeps and sighs echoed from the rows of beds, punctuated by the frantic calls of nurses and doctors. It was always like this on a Friday night – chaos disguised as controlled pandemonium. 

Amelia adjusted her stethoscope, its cool metal grounding her amidst the swirling storm. Five years of experience had taught her to navigate this battlefield, to decipher the urgency in a patient's tremor or the desperation in their whispered plea. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling tension hung in the air, a sense of anticipation that set Amelia’s teeth on edge.  The usual Friday night rush seemed amplified, each call more desperate, each injury more severe. It was as if something was brewing beneath the surface, a storm about to break beyond the ER's pale walls.
