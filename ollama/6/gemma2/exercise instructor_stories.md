The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of chlorine in the cramped community pool room. Sweat glistened on Amelia Rose Butterfield's forehead as she adjusted her neon pink headband, her smile bright against the backdrop of tired, sun-bleached walls.

But Amelia thrived on it. She was a force of nature in the shallow end, her turquoise leggings a blur as she led the group through synchronized splashes and high-kicks. 

Today, however, something felt different. A new face stood at the edge of the pool, watching with an intensity that sent a prickle down Amelia's spine. His dark eyes held a mix of amusement and curiosity, making her feel like a performer under scrutiny. He wasn't intimidating, not exactly, but there was something about him, a quiet confidence that demanded attention.
