The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sickly yellow pallor across the dusty vinyl floor. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee, cheap disinfectant, and the lingering aroma of yesterday's pizza feast in the break room. This was Amelia "Amy" Brighton's domain - the cavernous second floor of the Grand Meridian Hotel, where dreams were made and broken, and she spent her nights cleaning up the debris of both.

It was 2:17 AM, and Amy pushed her mop across the crimson carpet in front of Room 213, the source of tonight's symphony of muffled sobs and frantic whispers. She’d heard it all before – drunken arguments, lovers' quarrels, clandestine meetings - but tonight felt different. There was a raw, desperate quality to the sounds that made her stomach twist.

She sighed, pushing the mop bucket aside. Another night, another story unfolding behind closed doors.
