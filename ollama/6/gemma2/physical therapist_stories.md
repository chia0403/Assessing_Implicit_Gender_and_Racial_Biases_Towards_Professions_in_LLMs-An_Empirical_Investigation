The aroma of eucalyptus and peppermint oil hung thick in the air, a welcome contrast to the sterile scent that usually permeated Amelia Beatrice Hawthorneâ€™s world. Her office, tucked away on the third floor of a bustling physiotherapy clinic in downtown Chicago, felt less like a workplace and more like a sanctuary. Sunbeams slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the room's warm wood floors.

Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, adjusted the weight on the resistance band. A sigh rumbled from behind her as Thomas Miller, a middle-aged accountant recovering from a knee injury sustained during a disastrous attempt at rock climbing, hunched over his walker. His face, creased with the tension of months spent immobile, softened slightly when Amelia smiled.

"Ready for round two, Mr. Miller?" she asked, her voice gentle yet firm. 


Thomas grimaced. "As ready as I'll ever be, Ms. Hawthorne. Though my knee is already starting to feel like it's protesting."
