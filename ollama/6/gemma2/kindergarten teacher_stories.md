The scent of crayons and glue hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of disinfectant that clung to everything at St. Jude's Kindergarten. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating swirling motes of dust and turning the classroom into a sunlit kaleidoscope.  Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick, her bright red cardigan a splash of colour against the pale yellow walls, surveyed her domain with an air of weary contentment. Her smile, though thin, was genuine. She loved these tiny humans, with their boundless energy and endless capacity for wonder, even if they did leave a trail of glitter in their wake wherever they went. 


But this morning, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickle of unease at the back of Amelia's neck. Perhaps it was the unusually quiet chatter emanating from her students, or the fact that Mrs. Higgins, the lunch lady with perpetually rosy cheeks and an uncanny ability to make the blandest gruel taste delicious, looked pale and worried as she passed by the classroom door. 

Whatever it was, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary, something unsettling, was about to unfold in her sunlit classroom.
