The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Dr. Amelia Croft's waiting room. It was one of those Seattle mornings – grey, drizzly, the kind that seeped into your bones and made even coffee taste lukewarm. The faint scent of pine needles from a forgotten Christmas tree lingered in the air, mingling with the antiseptic tang that always permeated her small practice.  Amelia idly watched the raindrops streak down the windowpane, their rhythm mimicking the gentle tick-tock of the antique clock on the wall. Her fingers tapped against the worn leather of her desk, a nervous habit she couldn't shake even after fifteen years in the business. Today felt different, heavier somehow. Perhaps it was the string of cancelled appointments that left an eerie silence hanging in the air, or maybe it was the gut feeling that something was about to shift – a change as sudden and unexpected as the downpour outside. 


Amelia straightened her spine, took a deep breath, and glanced at the door. It creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadow.  A new patient. And with them, perhaps, a new story.
