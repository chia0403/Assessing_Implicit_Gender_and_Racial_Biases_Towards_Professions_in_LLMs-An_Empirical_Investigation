The flickering neon sign cast a sickly yellow light across Detective Amelia Grace's rain-slicked trench coat. It buzzed like a trapped hornet, mirroring the restless energy gnawing at her insides. A greasy spoon diner, "Rosie's Eats," served as the backdrop for this midnight meeting – its chipped Formica tables and faded vinyl booths whispering tales of countless forgotten conversations and devoured dreams. Rain hammered against the windows, blurring the outside world into a watercolour wash of grey and yellow. 

Amelia sat across from her informant, a wiry man named Frankie "Fingers" DiMarco, his face half-hidden in the shadows cast by his fedora. His nervous tapping on the tabletop echoed through the otherwise quiet diner, punctuated only by the rhythmic hiss of the coffee machine. 


“She’s good, Detective,” Fingers rasped, pushing a crumpled photo across the table. "The best.  But she plays dirty.”

Amelia reached for the photo, her gaze lingering on the woman's face – a beautiful enigma framed by raven hair and emerald eyes that seemed to pierce straight through her. The name scribbled on the back read: Serena Thorne.
