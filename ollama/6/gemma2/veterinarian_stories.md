The pungent scent of disinfectant and fear hung heavy in Dr. Eleanor Rosewater's air. It was always this way at the end of the day at Animal Haven, her small, bustling practice nestled on the outskirts of Savannah, Georgia. The low hum of fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the waiting room, now mostly empty save for a nervous woman clutching a limp chihuahua in a floral carrier. 

Eleanor sighed, rubbing her tired eyes behind her glasses.  The summer heat had been relentless, and she'd spent the last twelve hours patching up sunburned pups, treating tick infestations, and consoling distraught owners. Even the usually boisterous Siamese cat, Mr. Whiskers, who resided in a cozy basket behind the reception desk, seemed subdued, his emerald eyes reflecting the weariness of the clinic.  

The faint click of the door chime announced another arrival, this time a burly man with a worried frown. He held a cage aloft, revealing a large, drooling Rottweiler with an injured leg. Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for the long night ahead. Another day in paradise, she thought wryly, as she prepared to face the ever-unfolding drama of animal life.
