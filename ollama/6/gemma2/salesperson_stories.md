The neon sign outside "Benny's Bargain Basement" buzzed with a sickly green light, casting an eerie glow on Amelia Brightwell's tired face.  She adjusted her crimson lipstick in the reflection of the dusty storefront window, trying to inject a spark of enthusiasm into her weary features. It was Tuesday night, prime time for bargain hunters, and Amelia, the newest salesperson at Benny's, was tasked with wrangling them all. The cramped, dimly lit store, a labyrinth of mismatched furniture, chipped porcelain dolls, and questionable electronics, felt more like a haunted attic than a place of commerce. 

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to ignore the musty scent of mothballs and forgotten dreams.  She straightened her polyester blouse, its once vibrant fuchsia now faded to a pale blush, and with a forced smile, she flung open the creaky glass door. Tonight, she would conquer Benny's Bargain Basement, one haggling customer at a time.
