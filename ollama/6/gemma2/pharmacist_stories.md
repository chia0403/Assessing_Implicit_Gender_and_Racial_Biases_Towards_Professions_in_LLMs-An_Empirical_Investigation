The fluorescent lights hummed over Agnes Persephone Bellweather’s head, casting a sickly yellow glow on the dusty shelves of her small-town pharmacy. Outside, the July air hung thick with humidity, the cicadas droning their monotonous symphony like an endless orchestra tuned to boredom. Inside "Bellweather's Remedies," Agnes meticulously counted out peppermint capsules, the gentle click-clack of the dispenser a soothing counterpoint to the incessant buzzing outside. She knew every customer by name and ailment: Mrs. Henderson’s arthritis, Mr. Peterson’s seasonal allergies, even little Timmy Johnson’s penchant for swallowing marbles.  

Agnes loved her town, Willow Creek, with its cobblestone streets and gingerbread houses, but lately, a feeling of unease had settled over her like a shroud. It started subtly – whispers exchanged in hushed tones, doors slammed a little harder, the usual warmth replaced by a nervous energy that crackled beneath the surface.  Agnes couldn't pinpoint the cause, but something felt different, amiss.  And as she carefully placed the peppermint capsules into a small brown paper bag, a shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't just another ordinary day in Willow Creek.
