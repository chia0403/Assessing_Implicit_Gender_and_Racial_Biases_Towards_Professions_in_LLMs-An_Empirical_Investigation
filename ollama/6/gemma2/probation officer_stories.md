Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Amelia Grace Thornton's tiny office, mimicking the relentless drumming in her head. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the overflowing file folders piled precariously on her desk. A mug of lukewarm coffee, long forgotten, sat gathering dust beside a half-eaten granola bar. 

Amelia sighed, pushing aside a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its bun. It was always like this - chaotic, understaffed, and perpetually drenched in the dreary hues of bureaucratic despair. But Amelia wouldn't trade her job for anything. She thrived on the challenge of guiding lost souls back towards the light, navigating the treacherous terrain of rehabilitation one probation meeting at a time.  

Her phone buzzed, jolting her from her thoughts. A familiar number flashed across the screen: Michael "Mick" Donovan, notorious petty thief and Amelia's most recent case. He was scheduled for his first meeting in two hours, and something in Amelia's gut told her this wasn't going to be a routine check-in. 


**Setting:** 

A dreary probation office in a rundown building on the outskirts of Philadelphia. Itâ€™s understaffed and underfunded, with peeling paint, flickering fluorescent lights, and overflowing files. The rain outside adds to the gloomy atmosphere.
