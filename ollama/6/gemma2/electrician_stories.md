The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and sweat.  Sparks showered down from the tangled mess of wires Amelia "Amy" Hayes wrestled with in the cramped attic. Dust motes danced in the single beam of her headlamp, illuminating the rotted floorboards and cobwebs clinging to every surface. A rusted furnace coughed and wheezed in the corner, its metal belly echoing the rumble in Amy's stomach.  It had been three hours since sheâ€™d started on this job, a call from an elderly couple whose power had mysteriously flickered out. 

The Victorian mansion perched on a windswept hill loomed over the sleepy town of Hollow Creek. Built in the late 1800s, it was known for its elaborate gingerbread trim and whispers of a tragic past.  Amy had heard the stories, but dismissed them as local folklore. That was before she saw the flickering shadows that danced at the edge of her vision, before the sudden drop in temperature sent shivers down her spine. 


Now, with each exposed wire she touched, a prickling unease crawled up her arms.  This wasn't your average electrical malfunction. Something felt...off.
