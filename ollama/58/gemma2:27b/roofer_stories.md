The midday sun hammered down on Jasper "Jazz" Delaney's shoulders as he wrestled with a stubborn bundle of asphalt shingles. Sweat stung his eyes, but he refused to blink – any break in concentration could send him tumbling from the steep pitch of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian roof. He grunted, heaving the shingle into place, the sharp scent of tar mingling with the smell of honeysuckle wafting up from the overgrown garden below.

This wasn't Jazz's ideal way to spend a Tuesday, but rent was due and his beat-up Ford F-150 needed new tires.  He squinted at the shimmering expanse of rooftops across the sleepy town of Oakhaven, each one telling a story – some of hardship, some of joy, all woven into the fabric of this close-knit community he'd called home for as long as he could remember.

Today, though, Jazz wasn't just repairing a roof; he was fixing his own life, shingle by stubborn shingle.
