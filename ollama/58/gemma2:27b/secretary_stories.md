Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Hawthorne & Sons Legal Offices, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Cartwright.  She tapped a manicured nail against her mahogany desk, the rhythmic clicking the only sound besides the insistent drumming of the rain. Stacks of files loomed like precarious skyscrapers on her desk, each one representing another case in which justice seemed agonizingly out of reach.

Amelia wasn't naive. She knew she was just a secretary, a cog in the machine of the law firm.  But today, the weight of injustice felt heavier than usual. A particularly heartbreaking custody case had been finalized that morning, leaving a young mother distraught and her children separated from their father. Amelia couldn't shake the image of the woman's tear-streaked face as she signed the final papers, her shoulders slumped with defeat. 

It was moments like these that made Amelia question everything. Was this all there was?  Pushing paper, scheduling appointments, listening to clients sob while knowing she could do nothing but offer a sympathetic smile and a cup of lukewarm tea? A yearning for something more, something meaningful, stirred deep within her.
