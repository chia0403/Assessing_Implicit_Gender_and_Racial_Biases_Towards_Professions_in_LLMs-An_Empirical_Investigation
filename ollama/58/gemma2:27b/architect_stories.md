Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elara Finch's office, blurring the neon cityscape beyond into a shimmering watercolour. The air hung thick with the scent of old coffee and desperation. Architectural models lay scattered across her desk, miniature monuments to dreams deferred. Each one represented a project lost - a community centre strangled by budget cuts, a sustainable housing development crushed under bureaucratic red tape, an ambitious museum design deemed "too avant-garde."

Elara sighed, rubbing tired eyes that mirrored the fatigue etched onto her face. At 32, she was already considered a veteran in the cutthroat world of architecture, but her portfolio held more unrealized visions than completed structures. Today, however, was different. Today, a glimmer of hope had arrived in the form of a crisp white envelope emblazoned with the gilded crest of Blackwood Enterprises. A chance to design their new headquarters, a project rumoured to be worth millions. 


This could be her big break.  

Elara reached for the envelope, her fingers trembling slightly as she sliced through the thick paper. Inside, nestled amongst elegant script and intricate details, lay a single, enigmatic sentence: "We need a building that whispers secrets."
