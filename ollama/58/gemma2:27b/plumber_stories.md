The humid New Orleans air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Thibodeaux like a second skin as he wrestled with a stubborn pipe under the ramshackle porch of a shotgun house in the Bywater. Rust flaked off the ancient iron under his wrench, staining his already grease-smeared hands a rusty orange. Cicadas buzzed incessantly, their chirping competing with the rhythmic clanging of Bart's tools and the distant mournful wail of a blues saxophone from somewhere down Frenchmen Street. 

He squinted at the tangled mess of pipes, muttering curses under his breath in a thick Cajun accent. This wasn't just any clog; it was a plumbing hydra, each time he cleared one blockage, another seemed to materialize. Bart suspected the previous owner had been a DIY enthusiast with a fondness for duct tape and wishful thinking.  

Sweat beaded on his forehead, dripping into his eyes. He wiped it away with a calloused hand, sighing heavily. Just then, a voice like gravel rolling down a hill called out from inside the house, "Bart! You findin' that leak yet?"
