Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy General Hospital, blurring the city lights into a hazy kaleidoscope.  Inside, the air thrummed with an unsettling quiet. Usually bustling even at this late hour, the ER seemed eerily deserted, save for Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes, a seasoned registered nurse with eyes that held a lifetime's worth of stories and worry lines etched deep around her mouth. 

The fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across the linoleum floor, highlighting the sterile gleam of stainless steel instruments and the unnerving stillness of empty gurneys. Esme leaned against the nursesâ€™ station, her coffee long gone cold in her hand, a growing sense of unease gnawing at her gut. The storm had knocked out power lines throughout the city, plunging several neighborhoods into darkness, but this quiet felt different. Like something was brewing beyond the tempestuous night.
