The air hung thick with woodsmoke and the scent of roasting garlic, a symphony familiar to Elara Josephine Moreau's senses. Dawn had barely cracked the horizon, casting long shadows across the cobblestone courtyard of La Petite Cocotte, her family's beloved restaurant nestled in the heart of Dijon, France.  Elara hummed along to Edith Piaf crooning from a dusty old radio perched on a windowsill, her hands moving with practiced ease as she kneaded dough for croissants.

The kitchen was her sanctuary, a space where flour dusted the air like powdered snow and copper pots gleamed under the warm glow of overhead lamps. Every crack in the worn wooden tabletops held memories - whispered secrets shared over late-night meals, the clanging joy of success after perfecting a new dish, the quiet grief that followed her father's passing. Today, however, Elara felt a tremor of anticipation mixed with trepidation.  A renowned food critic, known for his scathing reviews and impossible standards, was scheduled to dine at La Petite Cocotte that evening.
