The scent of sawdust and linseed oil hung thick in the air of Elias Blackwood's workshop, a comforting aroma that had permeated his life since childhood. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the jumble of tools and half-finished projects scattered across his workbench. A hulking oak beam lay center stage, its rough surface awaiting Elias’s masterful touch.  He ran a calloused hand over the wood, feeling the grain shift beneath his fingertips. It was destined to become the centerpiece of a grand staircase for the old Victorian mansion on Hawthorn Hill – a project Elias had been dreaming of tackling for months.

But today, Elias wasn't focused on the intricate curves and angles he would soon carve into the beam. A letter lay crumpled on the workbench beside him, its words searing themselves onto his mind like hot iron. His sister, Clara, was ill. The doctor in their small coastal town couldn't offer much hope. She needed to see a specialist in the city, but they lacked the funds for such a journey.  

Elias knew he had to act. He closed his eyes, picturing his sister’s gentle smile and fiery spirit.  He wouldn't let her down. He would find a way to get her the help she needed, even if it meant putting aside everything else – including the magnificent staircase waiting to be born.
