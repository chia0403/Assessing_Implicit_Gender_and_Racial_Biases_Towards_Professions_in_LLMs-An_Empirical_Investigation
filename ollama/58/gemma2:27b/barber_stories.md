The midday sun beat down on Bleaker Street, turning the already grimy asphalt into shimmering tar. A thin haze hung in the air, smelling faintly of coal smoke and something vaguely metallic. Inside "Benny's Blades," however, it was cool and fragrant. The air hummed with the low thrum of clippers and the gentle rasp of straight razors against leather strops.

Bartholomew "Benny" Finch adjusted his spectacles, peering intently into the mirror as he expertly trimmed the sideburns of Mr. Goldberg, a portly man whose booming laughter filled the small shop. Benny himself was a study in contrasts: his hands were rough and calloused from years of wielding sharp instruments, yet they moved with an almost delicate precision. His face, framed by salt-and-pepper hair that stubbornly refused to be tamed, held a permanent frown, but his eyes twinkled with mischievous humor.

Today, however, Benny's usual jovial demeanor was absent. A knot of anxiety tightened in his chest as he listened to the rhythmic clang of the trolley passing outside, each jolt a reminder of the news spreading like wildfire through the city: whispers of strange disappearances, hushed conversations about shadowy figures lurking in the alleys, and an unsettling fear that seemed to cling to every corner.
