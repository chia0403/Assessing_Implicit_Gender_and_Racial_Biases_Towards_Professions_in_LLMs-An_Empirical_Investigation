The incessant buzz of a faulty diode gnawed at Elias Finch's nerves. He tightened his grip on the soldering iron, sweat beading on his brow despite the cool air emanating from the old window unit rattling in its frame. Outside, the sun beat down on the ramshackle radio tower perched precariously atop the Arizona desert mesa. The wind whistled a mournful tune through the rusted girders, carrying with it the scent of dry earth and dust devils dancing across the horizon.

Elias sighed, setting down the iron and wiping his forehead with a grease-stained rag. This ancient AM transmitter was more trouble than it was worth, but it was the lifeline for the scattered ranchers and homesteaders who relied on its broadcasts for weather updates, news, and occasional bursts of country music that crackled through their radios like a fading memory.  Fixing it was Elias's duty, his responsibility.
