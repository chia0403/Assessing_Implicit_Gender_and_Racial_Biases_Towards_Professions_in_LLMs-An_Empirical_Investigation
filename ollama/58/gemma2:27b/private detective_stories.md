Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street.  Inside his cramped office, Theodore Augustine Pierce III - Theo to anyone foolish enough to call him anything else - swirled the dregs of lukewarm coffee in his chipped mug.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation, a familiar perfume in this part of town.

Theo wasn't one for sentimentality, but even he felt a twinge of pity for the woman slumped across from him. Her name was Esmeralda Delacroix, and she looked like a wilted rose - all fading beauty and trembling hands. She clutched a faded photograph between her manicured nails, her eyes red-rimmed and swollen.

"He's gone," she whispered, her voice catching. "My husband, Antoine... he just vanished." 


Theo leaned back in his creaky chair, the springs groaning under his weight. He knew this type - a woman clinging to the last vestiges of hope, desperate for someone, anyone, to find what was lost.  But finding people wasn't always about clues and logic; sometimes it was about navigating the murky waters of secrets and lies.

"Tell me everything, Ms. Delacroix," Theo said, his voice gruff but steady. "Everything."
