The incessant chirping of the antique phone on Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's desk was starting to sound like a mockingbird on amphetamines.  It shrieked at intervals that defied logic, jolting her from half-written emails and carefully constructed spreadsheets with alarming regularity. 

Esme sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear. The air in the dimly lit lobby of the Grand Blackwood Hotel smelled faintly of lemon polish and mothballs, a peculiar combination that somehow embodied the faded grandeur of the place.  Beyond the ornate mahogany reception desk, a dusty velvet armchair sagged invitingly beneath a chipped chandelier, its upholstery harboring a constellation of forgotten cigarette burns.

The phone shrieked again, its shrillness echoing through the cavernous lobby like a banshee's wail. Esme picked up the receiver, bracing herself for another disgruntled guest complaining about the lack of Wi-Fi or the lukewarm water pressure.  Little did she know, this call was about to unravel a mystery as tangled and dusty as the cobwebs clinging to the Grand Blackwood's forgotten corners.
