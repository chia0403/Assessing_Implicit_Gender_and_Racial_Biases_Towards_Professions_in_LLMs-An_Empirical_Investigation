The rhythmic squeak of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's sneakers echoed through the cavernous gymnasium as she adjusted the obstacle course. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. The scent of bleach and disinfectant hung heavy, a constant reminder that this wasn't just any gym â€“ it was the rehabilitation wing of Mercy Hospital, where Amelia worked her magic as an occupational therapist. 

Today, she was prepping for a session with Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter struggling to regain dexterity after a stroke. The obstacle course, designed to mimic everyday tasks like buttoning a shirt or pouring a cup of coffee, was crucial in his recovery. But Amelia knew it wasn't just about physical exercises. It was about rebuilding confidence, rekindling hope. 

As she carefully placed a stack of wooden blocks on the table, a familiar pang of anxiety tightened her chest. Would Mr. Henderson be discouraged today?  Would he see progress or succumb to frustration?  Amelia took a deep breath, reminding herself that every step, no matter how small, was a victory worth celebrating.
