The rasping whine of Silas Thorne's chisel against granite was a familiar song in the small village nestled between towering peaks. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty air, dappled the uneven stones littering his workshop floor.  Silas paused, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand. He squinted at the half-formed angel he'd been sculpting for weeks - its wings still rough, its expression yet to bloom into serenity.

He wasn't sure why he'd chosen an angel. Perhaps it was the yearning in his own heart for something beyond the hard reality of stone and chisel.  Or perhaps, as some villagers whispered, it was a tribute to the ethereal beauty of Elara, the blacksmith's daughter whose laughter echoed like wind chimes through the mountain valleys. Silas never confirmed nor denied these rumors, but the intensity with which he worked on his angel spoke volumes. 

Today, however, something felt different. A restless energy thrummed beneath his skin, a pull towards something unknown beyond the familiar comfort of his workshop. He craved a change, an adventure to break the monotony of his craft. Little did Silas know that fate, in the form of a weathered traveler and a cryptic message, was about to deliver exactly what he yearned for.
