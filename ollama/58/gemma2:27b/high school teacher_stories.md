The flickering fluorescent lights of Ms. Amelia Blackwood's classroom cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated by the dying afternoon sun filtering through the grimy windows. The last bell had rung ten minutes ago, but Amelia was still hunched over her desk, grading essays. Her brow furrowed as she deciphered a student's meandering attempt at analyzing Shakespeare's "Hamlet".  

Outside, the relentless summer heat pressed against the brick walls of Oakhaven High School, a building that seemed to sag under the weight of its own history. Amelia sighed, pushing her unruly auburn curls away from her face.  Another year, another crop of teenagers struggling to grasp the intricacies of literature and, more importantly, themselves. 

A sudden clatter from the hallway jolted her back to the present. Footsteps pounded towards her classroom door, followed by a muffled curse. Amelia straightened in her chair, curiosity battling with the familiar weariness that came with late afternoons at Oakhaven High.
