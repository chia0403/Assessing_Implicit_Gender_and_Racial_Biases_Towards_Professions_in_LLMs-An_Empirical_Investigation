The air hung thick with the metallic tang of disinfectant and the faint sweetness of strawberry toothpaste.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne expertly maneuvered the ultrasonic scaler around Mr. Henderson's molars, her brow furrowed in concentration as she chipped away at a stubborn plaque deposit. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on Phoenix, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves of heat. But inside Dr. Patel's Dental Care, it was cool and sterile, a haven from the desert's fiery embrace. Amelia loved this contrast – the calm order of her world juxtaposed against the wild unpredictability of the outside.

Mr. Henderson grumbled something about needing a stronger anesthetic, but Amelia just smiled warmly and assured him everything was going well. He was a regular,  always complaining yet never missing an appointment. She knew his routine like clockwork – arrive five minutes late, grumble about the wait, then reluctantly open wide for her ministrations.

Today felt different though. A knot of unease tightened in Amelia's stomach as she finished cleaning Mr. Henderson's teeth.  She couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, a sense of foreboding hanging in the air like dust motes in the afternoon sun.
