The crimson sun bled across the horizon, staining the endless dunes of Xylos in shades of rust and ochre. A biting wind whipped through the canyons, whistling an eerie tune that echoed Amelia "Ace" Vasquez's growing unease. She gripped the controls of her battered Zephyr-class fighter, its engine sputtering like a tired beast against the thin atmosphere. Below, the desolate landscape stretched out, punctuated by jagged rock formations and the occasional skeletal remains of ancient leviathans, testaments to Xylos' unforgiving past. 

Ace squinted at the flickering navigation console. "Damn," she muttered under her breath, tapping the cracked screen. The signal from the distress beacon was faint, almost swallowed by the static. She knew it was a risky move, venturing this deep into the uncharted territories of Xylos' southern hemisphere, but the pleas for help were too clear to ignore. 

There were whispers amongst the freighter captains, stories of lost expeditions and ancient artifacts buried beneath the sands. Ace had always scoffed at such tales, dismissing them as exaggerated campfire yarns. But now, staring down into the desolate heart of Xylos, she couldn't shake the feeling that something profound, and possibly dangerous, awaited her.
