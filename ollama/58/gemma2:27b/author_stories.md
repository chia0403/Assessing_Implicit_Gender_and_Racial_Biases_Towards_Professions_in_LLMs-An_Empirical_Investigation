The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windowpane, illuminating motes dancing in the air above Elara Blackwood's typewriter.  Her fingers hovered over the keys, poised for inspiration, but all she felt was the gnawing emptiness of writer's block.

But the words refused to come, leaving Elara staring blankly at the half-finished pages scattered across her desk like fallen leaves.
