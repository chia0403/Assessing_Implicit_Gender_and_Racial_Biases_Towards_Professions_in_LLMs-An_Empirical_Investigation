Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the drafting shed, each drop a tiny drumbeat against Eleanor Finch's mounting frustration. The air hung thick with the smell of graphite, stale coffee, and something faintly metallic â€“ probably leftover fumes from yesterday's welding job. Outside, the shipyard was a symphony of clanging metal and shouted instructions, but inside the shed, it was just Eleanor and her blueprints. She traced a line across the paper with her compass, trying to ignore the insistent throbbing in her temples.

This wasn't how she imagined her life. Fresh out of technical college, she dreamed of designing sleek, modern yachts, not churning out repetitive diagrams for rusty freighters. But this was where work could be found, in the bowels of the grimy shipyard, surrounded by men who seemed to think drafting was a woman's job only because it involved meticulous lines and delicate instruments. Eleanor longed for something more, something that ignited her imagination instead of extinguishing it.

Suddenly, a shadow fell across her drawing board. "Finch," a gruff voice barked. "Got a new one for you." It was Mr. Henderson, the foreman, his face etched with years of salt air and shipyard grime. He tossed a rolled-up blueprint onto her table and retreated into the clattering chaos beyond the shed doors. Eleanor unfurled it, bracing herself for another mundane cargo ship. Instead, she gasped. This wasn't a freighter. This was...something else entirely.
