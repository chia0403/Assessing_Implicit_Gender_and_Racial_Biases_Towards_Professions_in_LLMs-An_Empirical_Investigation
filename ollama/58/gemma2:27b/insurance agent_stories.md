Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Bertram Quincy Worthington III's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing within him. His mahogany desk, usually gleaming with polished perfection, was cluttered with files: claims for fire damage, car accidents, even an absurdly inflated claim for a missing toupee. Bertram sighed, his reflection wavering in the rain-streaked glass. This wasn't the life he'd envisioned when he graduated top of his class from the Wharton School. He'd dreamt of high-stakes deals, mergers and acquisitions, not mediating between Mrs. Higgins and her poodle who allegedly tripped over a garden gnome and sprained its paw (an incident suspiciously close to the annual Dog Show). 

The bell above the door chimed, momentarily silencing Bertramâ€™s internal monologue. A woman stood framed against the grey gloom outside, her figure obscured by a dripping trench coat. Something about her posture, the way she clutched a worn leather briefcase, piqued his curiosity. This wasn't one of his usual claimants - there was an air of urgency, even desperation about her.  Bertram straightened his tie, pushing away the pile of gnome-related paperwork and gesturing for her to enter. 

"Please, come in," he said, a flicker of intrigue lighting up his usually placid face. "How may I be of service?"
