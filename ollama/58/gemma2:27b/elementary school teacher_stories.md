The bell shrieked, its high-pitched wail echoing through the bright yellow hallways of Sunnyside Elementary.  Eleanor Beatrice Finch, her auburn hair escaping its braid in wisps around her face, forced a smile as twenty pairs of wide eyes swiveled towards her.

"Alright, explorers," Eleanor chirped, clapping her hands together. "Time to pack up our imaginary backpacks and head back from the Amazon rainforest!"


The classroom buzzed with excited chatter as the children scrambled to gather their belongings. Sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating the colorful alphabet chart on the wall, the overflowing bookshelf crammed with well-loved picture books, and the vibrant artwork proudly displayed on every surface. Eleanor loved this room; it was a haven of creativity and learning, a place where imaginations soared and young minds were nurtured.

But today, Eleanor felt a knot of unease twisting in her stomach. Something wasn't right. It had started subtly, a few whispered comments from students about strange noises at night, flickering lights, and shadows moving in the hallways. Now, those whispers had turned into murmurs, and even some of her most fearless students were beginning to look apprehensive.  Eleanor pushed down her own rising fear, reminding herself that it was probably just childish imagination. But as she locked the classroom door for the day, a chill snaked up her spine. She couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was lurking within the walls of Sunnyside Elementary.
