Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the neon green lettering that advertised Amelia Cartwright's nutritional counseling services. The aroma of cardamom and ginger from her latest batch of chai tea couldn't penetrate the damp chill that had settled over the city of Seattle. Amelia sighed, tapping a manicured fingernail against the worn wooden countertop. Three o'clock and not a single client had walked through the door.

She was beginning to question if this whole "follow your dreams" thing was overrated. Leaving her comfortable corporate job at a supplement company to open her own practice had seemed like a brilliant idea six months ago, but lately, it felt more like a recipe for disaster. Maybe she should have stuck with spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations.

Just as Amelia reached for her phone to order takeout – again – the bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of a customer. A figure, shrouded in a dripping raincoat, stepped hesitantly into the warm glow of the café.
