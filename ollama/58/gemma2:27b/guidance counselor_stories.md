Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eloise Beaumont’s office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her.  

Her cramped office, tucked away in the forgotten corner of Willow Creek High School, was a haven for lost souls - or at least it was supposed to be. Today, however, felt different. The usual scent of old textbooks and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mixed with the acrid tang of Eloise’s anxiety.  Across her desk sat Liam O’Connell, a lanky seventeen-year-old with haunted eyes that mirrored the storm raging outside. He hadn't spoken in ten minutes, just stared at his hands, knuckles white as he gripped the worn leather of his backpack. 


Eloise knew Liam was wrestling with something big, something she couldn't quite grasp. He’d come to her seeking guidance, a rare occurrence for someone who usually kept to himself. But today, Liam's silence spoke volumes, promising a story far more complex than any standardized test or college application could reveal.
