The air conditioning unit wheezed, struggling against the relentless July heat radiating through the windows of Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery's small office.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the blinds, illuminating a sea of crumpled receipts and half-filled W-2 forms strewn across her desk. Outside, cicadas shrieked their summer symphony, punctuated by the occasional honk of impatient drivers on the congested street below. Bea, her forehead furrowed in concentration, tapped her pen against a Form 1040, her lips moving silently as she deciphered the client's tangled financial web.

She was nearing the end of tax season, that brutal marathon of deadlines and deductions, and exhaustion tugged at her like a persistent ache. But Bea wasn't one to give up easily. She took pride in her work, finding satisfaction in untangling the knots of numbers and helping her clients navigate the labyrinthine world of taxes.
