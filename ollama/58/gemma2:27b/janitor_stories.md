The fluorescent lights hummed an off-key symphony above Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' head as he pushed his battered mop bucket across the linoleum floor. The scent of stale sweat and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in this cavernous high school gymnasium.

Bart had been mopping these floors for fifteen years, ever since he'd dropped out of night school, disillusioned with the endless grind of academics. He found solace in the rhythm of his work: the swish of the mop, the squeak of the bucket wheels, the satisfying scent of freshly cleaned linoleum. This gym, with its faded paint and scuffed hardwood court, was his sanctuary, a place where the echoes of bouncing basketballs and cheering crowds had become a comforting white noise.

Tonight, though, something felt different. A strange tension crackled in the air, making the hairs on the back of Bart's neck stand on end. He paused, listening intently. The usual silence of an empty school was broken by a soft, rhythmic tapping coming from the darkened locker room at the far end of the gym. 

Bart swallowed, his throat suddenly dry. He'd been alone in this building for hours. Who could be making that noise?
