Rain hammered against the glass storefront, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. The scent of damp earth and petrichor mingled with the heady perfume of lilies and roses inside "Petals & Thyme," Elsie Beatrice Hawthorne's haven from the storm raging outside.

Elsie, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, hummed softly as she arranged crimson carnations into a cascading bouquet. The rhythmic thumping of rain was strangely soothing, allowing her mind to wander. She pictured the recipient, a young bride-to-be, nervously anticipating the delivery of her wedding flowers. Elsie smiled, picturing the joy that bloomed alongside each petal.

But today, even the vibrant colors seemed muted against the backdrop of the relentless downpour. A shiver ran down Elsie's spine as a particularly loud crack of thunder echoed through the street. It wasn't just the storm; something else felt off, a prickle of unease she couldn't quite place.
