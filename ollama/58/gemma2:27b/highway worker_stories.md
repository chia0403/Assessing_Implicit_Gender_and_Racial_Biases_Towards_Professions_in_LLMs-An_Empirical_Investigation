The Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a branding iron, searing through the thin cotton of his work shirt. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling reddish-brown against the endless expanse of cracked asphalt that stretched before him. Eli wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, squinting at the shimmering horizon. His crew had been patching potholes on Highway 95 for hours, the constant drone of machinery and the rhythmic thud of shovels against pavement forming a monotonous soundtrack to their day.  

Eli wasn't one to complain. He knew this work was crucial, keeping travelers safe as they traversed the desolate heartland. But today, something felt different. A prickling unease crawled under his skin, an instinctive sense that something was amiss. The usual rhythm of the road seemed off-kilter, a discordant note in the symphony of desert stillness.
