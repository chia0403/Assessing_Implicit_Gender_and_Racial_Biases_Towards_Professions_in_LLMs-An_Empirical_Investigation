The humid air hung heavy over New Orleans like a damp shroud, thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets. Above, Spanish moss dripped from ancient oak trees, casting eerie shadows across the cracked cobblestones of Jackson Square. Elodie Thibodeaux adjusted her straw boater hat, its crimson ribbon fluttering in a mischievous breeze.

"Welcome, everyone," she began, her voice carrying with practiced ease over the murmur of the crowd gathered before her. "To the most haunted city in America, New Orleans!" A few nervous giggles rippled through the group. Elodie smiled, a glint of mischief dancing in her deep brown eyes. "Don't worry, darlings," she reassured them, "the ghosts are mostly friendlyâ€¦ for now."  

As she launched into the history of Jackson Square, weaving tales of voodoo queens and pirate plunder, Elodie couldn't help but feel a familiar thrill course through her. Leading tours wasn't just a job; it was a way to connect with the city's soul, its whispers of the past echoing in every cobblestone and wrought iron railing.
