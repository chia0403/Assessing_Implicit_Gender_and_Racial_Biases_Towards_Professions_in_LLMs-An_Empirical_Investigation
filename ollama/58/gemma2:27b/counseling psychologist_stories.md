The air conditioner hummed in Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, struggling against the August heat clinging to the brick walls of the century-old building. Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, painted squares on the worn oriental rug. Outside, the city throbbed – car horns, distant sirens, the rumble of a bus – but inside, it was quiet save for the soft tick of Eleanor's antique clock.

Eleanor leaned back in her chair, tracing a finger along the spine of Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams" resting on her desk. It was her father's copy, dog-eared and underlined in faded ink. She often wondered if he ever imagined his daughter would become a counseling psychologist, helping people untangle their own dreams and anxieties instead of dissecting them on a couch.

Today's appointment was with Amelia Hayes, a young woman struggling with crippling social anxiety. Eleanor glanced at the clock – 2:45 pm. Amelia was late. A familiar pang of anxiety tightened in Eleanor's chest. She hoped Amelia wouldn't cancel. It had taken weeks for her to finally agree to therapy.
