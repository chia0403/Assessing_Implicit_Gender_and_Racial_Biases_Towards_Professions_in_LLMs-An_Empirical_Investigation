Rain lashed against the windows of the quaint rehab center, mimicking the storm brewing inside Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's chest. The scent of disinfectant mingled with stale coffee hung heavy in the air, amplifying the sense of stagnation Ellie felt. Five years she'd been at Coastal Rehab, tirelessly coaxing broken bodies back to life, but lately, it felt like more and more of her patients were arriving already defeated. 

Today's case was no exception. A stoic young man named Liam Hawthorne sat slumped in a wheelchair, his gaze fixed on some invisible point beyond the rain-streaked glass. He'd been a promising athlete before a motorcycle accident shattered his leg, leaving him with a titanium rod and a heart heavier than any cast Ellie had ever encountered.

Ellie took a deep breath, steeling herself for the uphill battle ahead. Liam was her toughest challenge yet, not just physically, but emotionally. She knew she couldn't force him to heal, but maybe, just maybe, she could remind him of the strength he still possessed.
