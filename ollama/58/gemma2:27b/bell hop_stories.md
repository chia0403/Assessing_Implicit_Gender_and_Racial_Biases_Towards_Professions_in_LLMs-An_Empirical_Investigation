The mahogany doors swung inward with a weighty sigh, releasing a blast of humid air tinged with the scent of jasmine and exhaust fumes. Reginald "Reggie" Bartholomew adjusted his crimson cap, squinting against the glare reflecting off the chrome-plated Cadillac idling at the curb. Another day in paradise, he thought wryly, as the afternoon sun beat down on the ornate facade of the Grand Majestic Hotel. 

The lobby buzzed with activity: a gaggle of giggling debutantes draped in pastel gowns, their fathers barking orders at beleaguered waiters; a harried businessman pacing back and forth on his cell phone, his suitcase perched precariously on a gilded stool; and a couple lost in their own world, whispering sweet nothings against the backdrop of tinkling piano music. Reggie navigated the chaos with practiced ease, his trolley laden with luggage waiting patiently by the revolving doors. He was the Grand Majestic's most seasoned bellhop – a veteran of countless arrivals and departures, of whispered secrets and stolen glances. 


This day, however, promised to be different. A palpable tension hung in the air, punctuated by hushed conversations and furtive looks towards the grand staircase leading up to the penthouse suite. Reggie knew something was amiss, but he couldn't put his finger on it. As he waited for his next guest, a shiver ran down his spine – the unmistakable feeling that fate had just dealt him a hand he wasn’t prepared to play.
