The wail of the ambulance siren sliced through the thick humidity, echoing off the crumbling facades of the buildings lining Canal Street. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already murky neon lights into abstract streaks of color. Inside, Evangeline "Eve" Dubois gripped the gurney handles, her knuckles white as bone. The patient, a young man with a shattered leg and a face pale with shock, moaned softly, his breath shallow and ragged.

Eve's heart pounded in time with the siren. This was her city, New Orleans, a place where beauty and decay intertwined like vines on ancient oaks, and where life often hung by the thinnest of threads. As an EMT for the Crescent City Ambulance Service, she'd seen it all: joyous births in cramped apartments, heart-wrenching deaths on rain-slicked streets, and everything in between. 

But tonight felt different. The air crackled with an ominous energy, like a storm brewing within the storm. Eve couldn't shake the feeling that this call, this injured young man, was just the beginning of something far bigger and far more dangerous.
