The stale air hung heavy in the cramped galley, thick with the scent of lukewarm coffee and anxiety.  Elara Vance adjusted her perfectly coiffed bun, willing away the fluttering in her stomach. Outside, the storm raged – a churning tempest of grey clouds and angry lightning that reflected Elara's own unease. This wasn't just any flight; it was Flight 714 to Tokyo, infamous for its recent string of bad luck. Engine troubles, diverted landings, even a rogue passenger last week who swore he saw Bigfoot in the first-class lavatory.

Elara sighed. She loved her job, truly she did. The thrill of travel, connecting with people from all walks of life – it was intoxicating. But lately, something felt off. A whisper of dread followed her down every aisle, a prickling sensation at the nape of her neck that wouldn't go away. As she braced herself for another turbulent hour, a chilling thought crossed her mind: what if the rumors about Flight 714 were more than just bad luck?
