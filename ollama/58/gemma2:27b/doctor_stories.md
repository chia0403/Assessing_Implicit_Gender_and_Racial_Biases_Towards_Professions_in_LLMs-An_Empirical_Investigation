Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elara Beaumont's makeshift clinic, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the warped glass. The air inside was thick with the scent of antiseptic and desperation.  Elara, her auburn hair escaping its braid and plastered to her forehead with sweat, wrestled with the IV drip in her latest patient's arm. The flickering candlelight cast long, dancing shadows across the room, barely illuminating the gaunt face of the young boy she was trying to save. 

He coughed, a rattling sound that tore at Elaraâ€™s heart.  Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempest within her. This ramshackle clinic, cobbled together from salvaged wood and canvas in the lawless outskirts of New Alexandria, was all that stood between life and death for the forgotten souls who sought refuge here.
