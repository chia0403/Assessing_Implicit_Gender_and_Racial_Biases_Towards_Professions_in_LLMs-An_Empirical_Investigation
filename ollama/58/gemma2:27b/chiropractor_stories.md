Rain lashed against the old Victorian windows, blurring the already fading daylight into an impressionistic swirl of greys and browns. Dr. Elara Blackwood sighed, her gaze drifting from the relentless downpour to the dusty spine of anatomy textbooks lining her cramped office shelves. 

Her clinic, nestled amidst the cobblestone alleys of historic Edinburgh, was eerily quiet tonight. Usually, a steady stream of patients - weary office workers, athletes nursing sprains, and the occasional bewildered tourist with crick in their neck - kept Elara occupied well into the evening. But tonight, the city seemed to be holding its breath, mirroring the tense anticipation bubbling within her own chest. 

She had received an unusual phone call that afternoon, a cryptic message from a man who only identified himself as "Alistair." He claimed to have a rare and debilitating condition, one he insisted only Elara could treat. His words were laced with urgency, bordering on desperation. Now, hours later, Alistair was due any minute, his arrival shrouded in the same unsettling mystery that clung to Edinburgh's fog-laden streets.
