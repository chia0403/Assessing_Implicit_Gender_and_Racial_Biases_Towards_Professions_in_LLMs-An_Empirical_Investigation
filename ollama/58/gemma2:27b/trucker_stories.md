The desert air hung thick and heavy, shimmering above the asphalt ribbon unwinding before Elias "Eli" Blackwood. His Peterbilt 379, christened "The Iron Raven," groaned under the weight of its load – fresh produce bound for Denver from the fertile valleys of California.  He squinted through the dust-caked windshield, the setting sun casting long shadows across the desolate landscape. The only sounds were the rhythmic hum of the engine and the lonely whine of the wind whipping through the empty scrubland. Eli adjusted his trucker hat, its faded logo a testament to years on the road, and took a swig from his thermos.  Denver was still hours away, and the endless expanse of desert seemed to stretch before him like an unforgiving ocean.

Eli wasn't one to complain. He found solace in the solitude of the open road, the freedom of choosing his own path, even if that path was often paved with asphalt and punctuated by lonely truck stops. Tonight, however, a strange unease gnawed at him. The silence felt heavier than usual, broken only by the occasional shriek of a hawk circling high above.  As he crested a rise, Eli caught sight of something in the distance – a faint flicker of light against the darkening horizon. It wasn't the steady glow of a highway marker or a distant town. This was something different, something unsettling.
