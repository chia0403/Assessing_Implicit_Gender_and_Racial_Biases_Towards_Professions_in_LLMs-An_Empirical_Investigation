Rain lashed against the windows of Sunshine Daycare, mimicking the drumming anxiety in Elara Kensington's chest. The power flickered ominously, plunging the brightly decorated room into momentary darkness before sputtering back to life.  Outside, wind howled like a banshee, whipping the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel by the playground into a frenzied dance.

Elara glanced nervously at the clock on the wall - 5:47 pm. The parents were late. Again. She sighed, smoothing down her floral print dress and straightening the lopsided tower of blocks little Liam had been constructing with painstaking care.  

Liam, bless his heart, was oblivious to the mounting tension. He hummed happily, a chubby fist clutching a bright red toy truck. His large brown eyes, brimming with innocent curiosity, followed Elara's every move. 


This was Elaraâ€™s first week on the job at Sunshine Daycare, and already she felt like she was drowning in responsibility. The owner, Mrs. Peterson, had assured her it was a "piece of cake", but dealing with delayed pick-ups, tantrums, and endless diaper changes was proving to be anything but sweet.
