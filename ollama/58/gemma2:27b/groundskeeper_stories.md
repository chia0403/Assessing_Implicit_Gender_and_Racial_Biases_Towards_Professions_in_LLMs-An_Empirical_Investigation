The sun, still drowsy from its slumber behind the distant mountains, cast long, skeletal shadows across the sprawling lawns of Thornhill Manor. Dewdrops clung precariously to blades of emerald green grass, shimmering like miniature diamonds under the nascent light. Alistair Finchley, head groundskeeper of Thornhill for over twenty years, surveyed his domain with a practiced eye. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the sweet scent of honeysuckle and the earthy fragrance of freshly turned soil.

Alistair loved this time of day, before the manor's inhabitants stirred from their slumber. It was a time of quiet contemplation, when he could lose himself in the rhythmic hum of his mower or the gentle whisper of wind through the ancient oak trees that lined the drive. Today, however, a sense of unease tugged at him. A crow cawed harshly from atop the crumbling stone fountain, its call unsettlingly sharp against the peaceful morning symphony. Something felt off.
