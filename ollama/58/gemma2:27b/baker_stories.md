The air hung heavy with the scent of caramelized sugar and warm yeast. Amelia Beatrice Cartwright surveyed her domain – "Bea's Buns & Beyond" – with a critical eye. Dawn was barely breaking, painting streaks of pink and orange across the bakery windows, but already the ovens hummed a low, comforting song, their heat radiating through the worn floorboards. 

Amelia, flour dusting her apron like snowdrifts, adjusted the lopsided display of croissants in the front window. Today was "Cinnamon Roll Saturday," a tradition she'd started years ago after inheriting the bakery from her grandmother. The aroma of cinnamon and brown sugar already wafted down the cobbled street, promising a sweet start to anyone passing by. But Amelia couldn't shake a nagging sense of unease. It wasn't just the strange, handwritten note tucked under her door that morning, warning her "to stop baking or else." It was something deeper, a feeling that the familiar rhythm of her life was about to be irrevocably disrupted.
