Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Finch's cubicle, mirroring the storm brewing in his gut.  The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the stacks of unsold vacuum cleaner brochures that cluttered his desk. Elias, a man whose smile usually outshone even the sunniest California day, now wore a grimace as deep as the wrinkles etched around his tired eyes. He hadn't closed a deal in weeks.  

The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a perfume unique to the cramped sales floor of "Clean Sweep Appliances." Elias drummed his fingers on the worn laminate desk, his gaze fixed on the rain-streaked street below. Beyond the grimy glass, the neon sign of "Burger Palace" flickered invitingly. He could almost taste the greasy comfort of a double cheeseburger and fries, a welcome respite from the metallic tang of failure that lingered in his mouth.  

But Elias knew he couldn't afford to indulge. Rent was due, the car needed fixing, and his daughter, Lily, had her heart set on new ballet shoes. He straightened his tie, a splash of faded crimson against the drab grey suit, and forced a smile onto his face. There were still hours left in the day, and Elias Finch didn't give up easily. Today, he would sell a vacuum cleaner. He had to.
