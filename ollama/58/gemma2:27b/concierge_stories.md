Rain lashed against the ornate windows of The Grand Blackwood, drumming a relentless rhythm that mirrored Evelyn Beatrice Cavendish's growing unease.  She straightened the velvet rope flanking the polished mahogany desk, her reflection wavering in its sheen. Outside, London was dissolving into a watercolour blur of grey and black, mirroring the storm brewing within Evelyn herself.

For five years, she had been the unflappable face of The Grand Blackwood, anticipating guests' needs before they even arose. A whisper of "Miss Cavendish" could conjure a first edition Shakespeare for a bibliophile or secure a last-minute reservation at Michelin-starred restaurants.  But tonight, a different storm threatened her composure â€“ a cryptic message delivered by an anonymous courier, promising to expose a secret that would shatter the hotel's opulent facade. 

Evelyn glanced at the antique clock ticking imperiously above the fireplace, its hands approaching midnight. The Grand Blackwood held its breath, its guests tucked away in their luxurious cocoons, oblivious to the impending drama. But Evelyn Beatrice Cavendish knew, with chilling certainty, that tonight was not just another night at the grandest hotel in London. It was the night everything would change.
