Eleanor Rose Winthrop adjusted her stained apron, a weary sigh escaping her lips as she surveyed the chaotic scene before her. A gaggle of college students shrieked with laughter at the corner booth, their empty beer pitchers teetering precariously. Two businessmen argued in hushed tones over spreadsheets spilled across a sticky tabletop. And a lone figure hunched over a plate of greasy fries, his face obscured by a fedora pulled low over his eyes. Eleanor knew each customer type like the back of her hand; regulars who tipped well, tourists who complained about the lack of wifi, and the occasional wanderer who seemed to exist in a world all their own.  Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced down her spine as she scanned the room, searching for the source of the unsettling feeling.
