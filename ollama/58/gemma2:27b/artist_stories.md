Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Eloise Delacroix's attic studio, mimicking the tempest raging within her. Paris shimmered, a jeweled necklace strewn across the darkness below, but Eloise saw only the harsh, unforgiving lines of her latest canvas. It was meant to be a celebration of spring â€“ a vibrant burst of color capturing the delicate blush of cherry blossoms against the cerulean sky. Instead, it resembled a battlefield, streaks of crimson and violet clashing violently, mirroring the discord in her own soul.

Eloise, with her unruly auburn curls escaping their braid and paint splattered across her freckled cheeks, was on the verge of despair.  The Parisian art scene felt as impenetrable as the fortress walls she often depicted in her work. Rejection after rejection had piled up like discarded canvases, each one a stinging reminder of her perceived inadequacy.
