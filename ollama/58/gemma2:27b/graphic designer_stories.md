Rain hammered against the grimy skylight above Elara Thorne's desk, each drop echoing like a miniature drum solo in her cramped studio apartment. The air hung heavy with the scent of instant noodles and desperation.  Elara stared at the laptop screen, its pale glow reflecting in her tired eyes. The design for "Pawsitive Vibes," a dog grooming salon, mocked her with its cheerful, cartoonish puppies. 

Her deadline loomed like a rabid Rottweiler. The owner, a flamboyant woman named Brenda who smelled perpetually of lavender and hairspray, had insisted on the most garish colour scheme imaginable - hot pink, lime green, and sunshine yellow. Elara's soul was slowly withering under the onslaught of saccharine hues.


This wasn't the life she'd envisioned when she graduated top of her class from Parsons School of Design. She dreamt of designing elegant magazine layouts, thought-provoking album art, maybe even a revolutionary app interface. Instead, she was stuck churning out logos for discount plumbers and flyers for dubious psychic readings.

The phone rang, jarring Elara from her misery. It was Brenda, her voice shrill with impatience. "Elara darling," she chirped, "how's that logo coming along? I need to send it to the printer by noon!" Elara sighed. Noon was less than three hours away.  She had a feeling this pawsitive vibe was about to turn very negative indeed.
