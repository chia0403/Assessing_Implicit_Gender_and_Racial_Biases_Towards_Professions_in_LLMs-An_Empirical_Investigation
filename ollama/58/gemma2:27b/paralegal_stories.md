Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia Cartwright's cramped office cubicle, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Stacks of legal documents threatened to engulf her desk – depositions, motions, and exhibits for the upcoming Henderson v. Blackwood trial. The case was a tangled mess of corporate espionage and stolen intellectual property, and Amelia, a paralegal with five years under her belt at the prestigious firm of Davenport & Thorne, felt the weight of it pressing down on her shoulders.

The air conditioning wheezed intermittently, barely battling the summer humidity that permeated the office. Amelia rubbed her tired eyes, the fluorescent lights reflecting harshly off her wire-rimmed glasses.  She longed to be anywhere but here – curled up with a good book in a cozy bookstore café, maybe, or strolling through the park with her dog, Winston.

Instead, she was stuck deciphering cryptic emails and chasing down missing witness statements. The trial loomed only two weeks away, and Amelia knew that every minute counted.
