Rain lashed against the windows of Maple Creek Veterinary Clinic, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's chest. She gripped the phone receiver tighter, her knuckles turning white. 

"Yes, I understand," she said, her voice strained. The caller, a distraught farmer named Jebediah Thompson, had just informed her that his prized sow, Gertrude, was experiencing severe complications during labor. Amy knew time was of the essence. Gertrude wasn't just any sow; she was the last breeding stock for a rare heritage breed Jebediah desperately wanted to preserve.

The clinic, nestled in the heart of rural Vermont, felt eerily quiet amidst the storm's fury. Outside, wind whipped through the towering maple trees that gave the town its name, their crimson and gold leaves swirling like fireflies in the twilight.  Inside, the scent of disinfectant and animal musk hung heavy in the air. Tools gleamed under the fluorescent lights, ready for whatever emergency walked, crawled, or was carried through the door. 

Amy took a deep breath, steeled herself, and grabbed her weathered medical bag. Gertrude needed her, and Amy wouldn't let this storm, or anything else, stand in her way.  She stepped out into the night, the rain instantly soaking her to the bone, but she barely noticed. Her focus was solely on reaching Jebediah and his beloved sow before it was too late.
