Grease stained his fingers permanently, it seemed, no matter how many times Elijah "Eli" Reyes scrubbed them raw. The air in Eli's garage hung thick with the scent of motor oil, gasoline, and something vaguely metallic, the smell of a life spent under hoods and amongst gears. Sunlight slanted through the grime-coated windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. Outside, cicadas buzzed their relentless summer song. 

Eli wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of black across his forehead. He was hunched over the engine of a cherry red '67 Mustang, its chrome gleaming despite years of neglect. The owner, a nervous young man named Danny, paced back and forth, biting his lip. "Think you can get her running, Mr. Reyes?" he asked, his voice cracking with uncertainty. Eli grinned, revealing a chipped tooth.

"Don't you worry, son," he rasped, his voice gravelly from years of inhaling engine fumes. "This old girl just needs a little love." He tightened a bolt, the wrench groaning in protest. Outside, thunder rumbled ominously in the distance.
