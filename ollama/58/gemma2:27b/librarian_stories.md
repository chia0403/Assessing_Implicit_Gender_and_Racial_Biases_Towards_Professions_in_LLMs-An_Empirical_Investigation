Sunlight streamed through the arched windows of the Athenaeum, illuminating dust motes dancing above towering shelves packed with centuries of knowledge.

Elara, her silver hair neatly braided, traced a finger along the spine of a leather-bound volume, its title – “The Occult Practices of 17th Century England” – barely visible beneath layers of grime. A shiver ran down her spine. This was no ordinary book, she could feel it. Something about its aged parchment and cryptic symbols whispered of secrets waiting to be unveiled.
