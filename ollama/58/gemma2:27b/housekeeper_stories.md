Rain lashed against the leaded windows of Blackwood Manor, each drop exploding in a miniature starburst on the ancient glass. Inside, Amelia Thistlewick wrestled with a particularly stubborn stain on the Persian rug â€“ a smear of what looked suspiciously like beetroot wine. The scent of damp wool and beeswax polish mingled with the faint, unsettling sweetness of decay that always seemed to permeate the old house.

Blackwood Manor stood hunched against the windswept moors, its silhouette a gothic masterpiece against the bruised sky. Amelia had been the housekeeper here for ten years, ever since inheriting the position from her aunt Agatha. It was lonely work, punctuated only by the occasional visit from Mr. Blackwood, the reclusive owner who rarely ventured beyond his library. 


Amelia sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. She loved the manor, with its hidden nooks and rambling corridors, but lately, something felt amiss. The silence had grown heavier, the shadows deeper. And there were the whispers... faint murmurs carried on the wind that spoke of things best left undisturbed.

Today, however, was different. Today, a letter had arrived, addressed to Amelia in elegant calligraphy. It promised a visitor - a distant relative of Mr. Blackwood who intended to stay for an extended period.

Amelia felt a shiver run down her spine. Change was coming to Blackwood Manor, and she couldn't help but wonder what secrets it would unleash.
