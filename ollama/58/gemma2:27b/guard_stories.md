The flickering torchlight danced across the moss-covered stones, casting long, grotesque shadows that stretched and writhed like living creatures. A frigid wind whipped through the crumbling archway, carrying with it the scent of brine and decay. Elias Thorne, his face grim beneath a weather-beaten helm, tightened his grip on the spear clutched in his calloused hand. 

He stood guard atop the eastern rampart of Blackwood Keep, its ancient walls overlooking the churning maw of the Iron Sea. Below him, waves crashed against the jagged cliffs with a thunderous roar, their whitecaps mirroring the icy fear that gnawed at Elias's gut. For weeks now, whispers had spread through the keep – rumors of monstrous creatures rising from the depths, preying on ships foolish enough to sail these treacherous waters. 

Elias had dismissed them as sailor’s tales, fanciful exaggerations spun around crackling tavern fires. But tonight, something felt different. The air crackled with an unnatural tension, a foreboding silence broken only by the relentless crashing of the waves and the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead. He scanned the horizon, his keen eyes searching for any sign of movement in the swirling mists that clung to the sea like ghostly tendrils.
