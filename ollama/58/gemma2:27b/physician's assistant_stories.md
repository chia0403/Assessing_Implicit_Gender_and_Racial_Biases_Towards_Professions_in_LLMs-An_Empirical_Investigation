The humid New Orleans air clung to Elara Dubois like a second skin as she hurried through the French Quarter. Beads still clung haphazardly to the wrought iron balconies overhead, remnants from Mardi Gras celebrations that felt lifetimes ago. The scent of beignets and chicory coffee wafted from Cafe Du Monde, momentarily tempting her with their sugary embrace. But Elara had no time for indulgences. Her pager buzzed insistently in her pocket, a relentless reminder of the waiting patient at Charity Hospital. 

Elara Dubois, PA-C, pushed open the heavy double doors, the familiar clatter echoing through the cavernous waiting room. She was used to the controlled chaos that was Charity â€“ the symphony of coughs, cries, and whispered prayers all interwoven with the rhythmic beeping of machines and hurried footsteps.  Today felt different though. A palpable tension hung in the air, tinged with something she couldn't quite name.

She navigated through the throngs of people, past overflowing triage stations and weary nurses, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. She needed to find Dr. Marcel, her supervising physician, and get briefed on the situation. The pager buzzed again, this time with an urgency that sent a shiver down her spine.  Whatever awaited her, Elara knew it wouldn't be ordinary.
