Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of "The Pillbox", blurring the neon sign into an abstract smear of pink and green. Amelia Blackwood sighed, her breath fogging the scratched glass as she peered out at the deserted street. It was well past closing time, but the relentless storm had kept customers away, leaving Amelia alone with the rhythmic drip from a leaky faucet and the incessant drone of the refrigerator holding the pharmacy's stock of vaccines. 

Amelia wasn't complaining. She relished these quiet moments, when the frenetic energy of dispensing prescriptions and placating anxious customers faded, replaced by the comforting hum of her old apothecary scales and the faint scent of lavender from the hand cream she kept on her desk. Tonight, though, a gnawing unease twisted in her gut. It wasn't the storm, nor the loneliness; it was something else, a subtle shift in the air, an unsettling premonition that prickled her skin like static electricity.
