The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Beatrice Finch's head, casting an anemic glow over the aisles of discounted groceries.  It was a Tuesday afternoon, the kind where even the flies seemed sluggish. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of artificial strawberry and cheap cleaning products, a perfume unique to Bargain Bin Bonanza. 

Eloise sighed, her breath fogging the glass partition separating her from the customers. A lone can of Spam rattled across the conveyor belt towards her, its metallic gleam mocking her boredom. She scanned it with practiced ease, the beep echoing through the near-empty store like a lonely gunshot.  This was Eloise's life: an endless parade of discounted cans, bruised fruit, and people who seemed perpetually on the verge of forgetting their wallets.

But today felt different. A tremor of unease prickled at the back of her neck. It wasn't the usual Tuesday afternoon slump; it was something else entirely, a feeling that whispered of impending change.  Eloise glanced out the window, towards the shimmering asphalt where a lone figure stood silhouetted against the setting sun. The figure seemed to be staring directly at her, their face obscured by the shadows.
