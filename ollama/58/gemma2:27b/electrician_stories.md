Rain lashed against the cracked windowpane of Theo Bartholomew’s beat-up pickup truck. The wipers struggled to keep up, smearing streaks across the glass that only amplified the gloom of the late November afternoon.  Theo sat hunched over the steering wheel, chewing on a thumbnail and staring at the address scrawled on a crumpled napkin: 13 Blackwood Lane. It was tucked away in the oldest part of Oakhaven, a town shrouded in perpetual mist and whispers of forgotten legends. The house itself looked like something straight out of a gothic novel – a looming Victorian mansion with ivy crawling up its walls like skeletal fingers.

Theo, a man more comfortable with the clean hum of electrical currents than the eerie silence of ancient houses, felt a shiver crawl down his spine. He wasn't sure what he'd gotten himself into accepting this job - fixing a "persistent electrical issue" for an anonymous client who paid in cash and insisted on absolute discretion. 

But Theo was drowning in debt after his father's passing, and the money was too good to pass up. Besides, he reasoned, it was just a blown fuse or a faulty circuit breaker. How hard could it be?  


He took a deep breath, grabbed his toolbox, and stepped out into the storm. The wind howled like a banshee, whipping rain into his face. As he trudged towards the looming silhouette of 13 Blackwood Lane, Theo couldn't help but feel a growing sense of dread. Something about this place felt wrong, deeply wrong.
