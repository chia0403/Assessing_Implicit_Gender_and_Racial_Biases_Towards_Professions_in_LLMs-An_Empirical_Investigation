The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and disinfectant, a familiar aroma that clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins like a second skin. The late shift at the Grand Aurora Theatre always felt lonely – the plush velvet seats were cold and empty, shadows stretching long across the worn stage floor. Outside, the city thrummed with life, but Barty knew its pulse was a distant rhythm compared to the quiet whispers of the past that echoed within these walls. He mopped the linoleum near the concession stand, his footsteps muffled by the thick carpet beneath his feet. The only light came from the dim overhead fluorescents, casting long, skeletal shadows across the posters advertising forgotten plays and long-gone performers.  Barty had worked here for nearly twenty years, cleaning up after dreams, both realized and unrealized. Tonight, he felt a particular pang of melancholy, a weight settling in his chest that wasn't just the familiar heaviness of another night shift. 


The old theatre held secrets, whispered stories passed down through generations of performers and patrons alike.  Barty had heard them all – tales of ghostly apparitions, stolen jewels, and forbidden romances. He usually brushed them off as fanciful ramblings, but tonight, with the silence amplifying every creak and groan of the building, he couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease.
