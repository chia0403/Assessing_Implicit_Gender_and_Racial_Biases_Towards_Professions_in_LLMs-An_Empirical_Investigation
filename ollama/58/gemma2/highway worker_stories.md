The sun beat down on Elara Beatrice "Ellie" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning her already damp t-shirt into a second skin.  She squinted at the asphalt ahead, trying to ignore the sweat stinging her eyes. The Georgia heat was a relentless beast this July, making even simple tasks feel like wrestling alligators. Ellie gripped the handle of her pickaxe tighter, muttering under her breath, "Just gotta get through this last stretch." 

The setting sun cast long shadows over the seemingly endless ribbon of highway she and her crew were tasked with repairing. It snaked through the heart of rural Georgia, a testament to human ambition cutting a path through rolling hills and whispering pines. Beyond the rumble of passing cars, there was only the chirping of crickets and the occasional screech of a hawk circling high above. 


Ellie wasn't sure what she hated more: the relentless sun or the ever-present hum of traffic that vibrated through her bones. Being a highway worker wasn't glamorous. It was hard, dusty work under a sky that often felt like it was breathing down your neck. But Ellie found a strange solace in its rhythm. The steady swing of her pickaxe, the scrape of asphalt against steel, the camaraderie of her crew â€“ these were the things that grounded her, kept her tethered to something real in a world that often felt too vast and indifferent.
