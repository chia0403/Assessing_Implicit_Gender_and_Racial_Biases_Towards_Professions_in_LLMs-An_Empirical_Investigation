The aroma of disinfectant and peppermint lingered in the air, thick as fog in the small office. Sunlight slanted through the window, highlighting dust motes dancing above Elara Beatrice Vance's outstretched hand. She was demonstrating to the new intern, a fresh-faced girl named Lily, how to properly angle the dental scaler against plaque buildup.  

"See," Elara said, her voice low and soothing despite the clinking of metal on enamel, "it’s all about finding the sweet spot. You don't want to be too aggressive, or you risk irritating the gums. But you also have to be firm enough to get those stubborn bits off."

Lily nodded earnestly, mirroring Elara's movements with a hesitant hand. The setting was familiar to Elara – a small town dental practice nestled on a quiet side street in quaint Elmwood, Ohio. It wasn't glamorous, but it was home. She knew most of the patients by name, their favorite flavors of mouthwash, even the squeaky sound of Mrs. Henderson’s dentures as she spoke. But beneath the comfortable predictability, Elara felt a growing restlessness. A yearning for something more, something beyond the daily grind of scaling and polishing teeth.
