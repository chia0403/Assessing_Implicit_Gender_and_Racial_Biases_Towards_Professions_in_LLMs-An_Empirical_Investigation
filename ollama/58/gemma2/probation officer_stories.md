The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Amy" Beaumont like a damp shroud as she surveyed the dilapidated porch swing swaying gently in the breeze. A faded yellow welcome mat, barely clinging to its tacks, lay beneath her feet. This was the front yard of Daniel Hawthorne's trailer, a ramshackle testament to his parole officer's warnings – a man better off behind bars than navigating the quicksand of freedom.

Amy adjusted the strap of her worn leather purse and pulled out a notebook, flipping through its pages filled with Hawthorne’s recent progress reports: “Lacking motivation,” "Association with known criminals," and "Failure to maintain employment" – a litany of transgressions that painted a bleak picture. She hoped this visit wouldn't be another one for the "difficult" category.

Hawthorne, however, hadn't followed her instructions to meet her at his doorstep. Instead, he emerged from the rusted metal shed behind the trailer, wiping grease from his hands onto a stained t-shirt. He looked up, squinting through dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun. 


"You here about that job I told you about?" he asked, his voice rough like gravel.  

Amy swallowed, trying to gauge the sincerity behind his words. His last attempt at employment had been selling bootleg fishing lures online – a venture that ended with him being accused of fraud and facing further jail time. 


"Let's talk inside," Amy said, hoping this wasn’t another one of Hawthorne's elaborate ruses.  She hoped he wouldn't drag her into his tangled web again.
