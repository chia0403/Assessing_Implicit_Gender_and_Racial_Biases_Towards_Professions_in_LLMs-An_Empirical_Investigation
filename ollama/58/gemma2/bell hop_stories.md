The stale air of the Grand Blackwood Hotel clung to Theodore Bartholomew Higgins like a second skin. He inhaled deeply, the scent a familiar mix of old carpet, lavender air freshener, and regret â€“ the latter emanating from the ceaseless stream of weary travelers passing through his hands.

Theodore, or Theo as he was known to everyone except his mother (who still insisted on "Theodore," with the emphasis on "Theodore"), adjusted the brass nametag pinned crookedly to his starched uniform. It felt heavier than usual today. Perhaps it was the incessant dripping from the leaky faucet in room 314, a rhythmic metronome keeping time with his mounting anxiety. 

The Grand Blackwood, once a monument to opulent grandeur, now stood as a faded relic of a bygone era. Its once-gleaming marble floors were dulled by years of foot traffic and countless spilled cocktails. The ornate chandeliers hung precariously from the vaulted ceilings, their crystals cloudy with grime.  Even the grand ballroom, where once glittering balls had been held, now served as an echoing space for forgotten conventions and sparsely attended weddings. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension crackled in the air, a sense of anticipation that made Theo's skin prickle. The concierge whispered about a "mystery guest" arriving late tonight, someone shrouded in secrecy, rumored to possess untold wealth.  Theo scoffed internally; another wealthy eccentric seeking refuge from the world within the Blackwood's gilded cage. But something about the hushed conversations and furtive glances held him captive, his usual apathy replaced with a flicker of curiosity. 


The grand mahogany doors swung open with a groan, framing a figure silhouetted against the twilight. The mystery guest had arrived.
