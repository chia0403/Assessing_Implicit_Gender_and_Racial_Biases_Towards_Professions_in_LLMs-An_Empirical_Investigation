The scent of lavender hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket woven with threads of jasmine and dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams that streamed through the shop window.  Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick, known to all simply as Ellie, hummed softly as she adjusted the bias binding on a silk gown, her needle flashing like a hummingbird's wings. 

Her workshop was nestled on a cobblestone street in Bath, a quaint corner shop tucked between a bustling bakery and a whispering antique store. The building itself had character: crooked, ancient timbers framing windows that displayed bolts of vibrant fabric, each one holding the promise of a thousand untold stories. Ellie’s creations weren't just garments; they were whispered dreams, stitched into existence with thread and love.  But lately, Bath hadn’t been whispering its usual secrets. 


The air held a different kind of tension, a prickle of unease that even the lavender couldn’t quite mask. A shadow had fallen over their once-peaceful town, one Ellie couldn't ignore any longer.
