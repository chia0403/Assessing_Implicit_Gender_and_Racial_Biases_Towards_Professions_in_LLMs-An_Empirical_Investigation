The scent of cinnamon and toasted oats hung heavy in the air of "Nourish," Amelia Clementine's cozy little nutrition clinic nestled on a cobblestone side street in Charleston, South Carolina. Outside, Spanish moss draped from ancient oaks, swaying gently in the warm breeze, while inside, Amelia was wrestling with a particularly stubborn jar of almond butter. 

She wasn't sure if it was her clumsy fingers or the fact that the jar had been sitting in the sun-baked pantry for far too long, but the smooth spread refused to yield.  "Honestly," she muttered, her voice echoing in the quiet room, "this is like trying to convince a carb-loving client to embrace kale." 

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of her next patient, a woman with eyes as bright and hopeful as the sunflowers that adorned Amelia's windowsill. This was Amelia's element - helping people navigate the confusing world of food, finding balance and joy in every bite. But today, something felt different, a prickle of anticipation buzzing beneath her usual calm.  


This patient, she sensed, wouldn't be just another case study.
