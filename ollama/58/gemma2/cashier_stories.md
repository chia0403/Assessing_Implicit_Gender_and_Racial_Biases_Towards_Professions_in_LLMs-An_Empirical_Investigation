The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees.  She tapped her acrylic nails against the chipped countertop, counting the seconds until her shift ended. The discount grocery store felt colder than usual tonight, the air thick with the scent of overripe bananas and stale disappointment. Customers shuffled by in a sluggish stream, their eyes glazed over as they scanned the aisles for bargains on day-old bread and mystery meat. Amelia barely registered them anymore, their faces blurring into a single mass of weary humanity. 

She longed for something more than this monotonous routine, something that would bring a spark to her life beyond the dull glow of the register screen.  Perhaps one day sheâ€™d escape this town, this job, this endless cycle of ringing up cans of beans and expired coupons. But tonight, all Amelia wanted was to clock out, go home, and drown her sorrows in a bowl of instant ramen.
