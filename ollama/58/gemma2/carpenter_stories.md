The air hung thick with sawdust and the scent of pine, a familiar aroma that clung to Elias Blackwood like a second skin. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of his workshop, illuminating motes dancing in the golden haze. A symphony of clanking hammers and whirring saws filled the small space, punctuated by the occasional grunt as Elias wrestled with a recalcitrant piece of oak. His calloused hands, tanned from years under the summer sun, moved with practiced grace, shaping the wood into elegant curves and precise angles. 

Elias Blackwood, a man whose life was woven from the grain of timber, stood at his workbench, a half-finished rocking chair taking shape before him. The project, commissioned by Mrs. Hawthorne for her granddaughter's first birthday, was imbued with the quiet weight of responsibility. Each carefully placed mortise and tenon spoke to Elias’ dedication – a promise of sturdy comfort and countless hours of gentle sway. Outside, the world bustled with its own rhythm, but within his workshop, time itself seemed to slow, measured by the steady pulse of creation.  

But today, a strange unease settled over Elias like a shroud. A persistent whisper on the wind carried a foreboding he couldn't shake. His usually joyful workspace felt strangely charged, the familiar sounds now tinged with an unsettling dissonance. He paused, his hammer hanging suspended mid-air, as if sensing something beyond the realm of wood and steel.
