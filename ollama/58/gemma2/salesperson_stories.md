The stale scent of coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of desperation. Amelia Beatrice Cartwright tapped her pen rhythmically against her worn notepad, its rhythmic click a counterpoint to the low hum of the showroom's fluorescent lights. The sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the dusty display of pre-owned luxury vehicles. 

Amelia, with her auburn hair pulled back in a tight braid and eyes that held both exhaustion and a flicker of stubborn hope, surveyed her domain. Each sleek car represented another potential sale, another chance to earn enough to keep her head above water.  But tonight, the usual bustling energy was absent. The only other sound besides her tapping pen came from the faint whirring of the cooling fans in the showroom's neglected air conditioning unit. 


It was going to be a long night.
