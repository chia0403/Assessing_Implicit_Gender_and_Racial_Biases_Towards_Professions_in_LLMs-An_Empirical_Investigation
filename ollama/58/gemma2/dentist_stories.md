The aroma of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a comforting familiarity to Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne. She adjusted her surgical mask, smoothing down the crisp white fabric that hid most of her face.  Her reflection in the stainless steel instrument tray showed eyes focused and determined behind the pale blue shield, a stark contrast to the soft lavender hues she favoured on her days off. 

The waiting room outside was hushed, the usual cacophony of coughs and anxious whispers replaced by an unnatural silence. A single child sat slumped on a worn floral armchair, kicking his legs restlessly.  Amelia glanced at the clock - it was barely past eight, a full hour before her first appointment. This wasn't unusual for Hawthorne Dental. The quiet hours were when she found solace, time to organize her thoughts and prepare for the day's dental marathon. 

But today, the silence felt different, pregnant with an unspoken tension that prickled at Amelia's skin. She couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, a subtle shift in the familiar rhythm of her practice. As she turned back to her instruments, a faint scratching sound from the hallway sent a shiver down her spine. 


The setting: A small, family-owned dental practice in a quiet suburban neighbourhood. The building is an unremarkable two-story brick structure with faded paint and a slightly crooked sign that reads "Hawthorne Dental." Inside, the waiting room is sparsely furnished with mismatched chairs and framed diplomas on the walls.
