The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thistlewick's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of identical cubicles. Outside her window, London throbbed with life – the cacophony of buses, the distant chatter of crowds, the faint melody of street performers – but inside her office at PricewaterhouseCoopers, time seemed to stand still. Amelia meticulously balanced figures in her spreadsheet, each click of the keyboard another tick on the clock, another minute further from the weekend's promise of escapism.  

It wasn't that she disliked accounting; it was a precise art, one where logic ruled and chaos had no place. But sometimes, Amelia longed for something more than the endless cycle of audits and tax returns. She craved adventure, a spark of excitement to break through the monotony of her life.
