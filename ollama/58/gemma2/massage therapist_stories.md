The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a calming fog clinging to Elara Juniper's linen clothes as she meticulously prepped her treatment room.  

Elara worked at Serenity Spa, nestled in a leafy corner of Portland, Oregon. The spa was a haven from the city’s frenetic pace, with exposed brick walls adorned with abstract paintings and warm sunlight streaming through large bay windows that overlooked a lush courtyard filled with blooming rhododendrons. 

The soft chime of the door announcing a new arrival broke Elara's focus. She glanced at her schedule; her next appointment was with a Mr. Theodore Hawthorne, a name she hadn’t seen before. A flicker of curiosity sparked within her as she straightened her apron and adjusted the lavender-scented oil warming on a small table beside her. 


Elara Juniper, with her kind eyes and gentle touch, had a knack for sensing her clients' anxieties beneath their carefully constructed facades.  She was ready to meet Mr. Hawthorne, but something about his name and the air of stillness surrounding him promised a deeper story than usual.
