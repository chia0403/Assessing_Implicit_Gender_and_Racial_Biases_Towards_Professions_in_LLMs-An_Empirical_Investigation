The humid air hung heavy over the tarmac like a damp blanket, clinging to Lieutenant Anya Petrova's flight suit as she walked towards her aircraft.  The roar of jet engines reverberated through the base in Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, a symphony of power that Anya both craved and dreaded.

The sun, a fiery orb sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows that danced menacingly across the grass. Tonight's mission was a routine reconnaissance flight, but Anya couldn't shake the feeling of foreboding that had settled upon her like the encroaching darkness.
