The steam from the boiling stock swirled around Eloise Amelia Beaumont like a phantom, carrying with it the savory scent of simmering veal bones, carrots, and thyme. It was her favorite part of the day â€“ the quiet before the storm, when the kitchen at "Chez Beatrice" was still hushed and the only sounds were the gentle hiss of the stove and the rhythmic chop of Eloise's knife as she diced fresh celery. 

The sun was just beginning to dip below the Parisian rooftops, casting long shadows across the bustling Rue de Rivoli, but inside Chez Beatrice, the world felt miles away. The walls, adorned with faded photographs of famous patrons and culinary masters, whispered stories of past triumphs and culinary revolutions. Eloise could almost feel the presence of her grandmother, Beatrice herself, a legendary chef who had built this restaurant from scratch, her spirit woven into every brick and mortar.


But tonight, something felt different.  A prickle of unease danced along Eloise's spine, a sense that the familiar rhythm of the kitchen was off-key.
