The air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and dew-kissed earth. Sunlight slanted through the ancient oaks lining the paths of Evermore Manorâ€™s sprawling gardens, painting dappled patterns on the neatly raked beds below.  Thomas Ashton, his brow creased with concentration, meticulously pruned a rosebush, his calloused hands working with practiced precision. He was a man of habit, of routine; the rhythm of the seasons, the pulse of the manor, mirrored in the measured snip of shears and the rustle of leaves beneath his boots.

Evermore Manor itself loomed over him, a grand edifice of faded grandeur, its once vibrant facade now softened by years of neglect. The whispers of forgotten stories clung to its ivy-choked walls, secrets buried deep within its shadowed halls. Thomas knew every nook and cranny of the gardens, every twist and turn of the winding paths, every whisper of the wind through the leaves. But lately, something felt different. A disquiet had settled over the manor, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck that told him the familiar peace was about to be shattered.
