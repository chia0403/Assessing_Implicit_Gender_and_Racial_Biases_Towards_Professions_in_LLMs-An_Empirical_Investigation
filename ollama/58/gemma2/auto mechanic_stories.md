The greasy air hung heavy in Amelia "Amy" Reyes's workspace, thick with the scent of engine oil, burnt rubber, and that metallic tang she'd come to associate with success. Outside, the Miami sun beat down on the rusty metal awning of her garage, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt. Palm trees swayed lazily in the humid breeze, oblivious to the symphony of clanking wrenches, whirring drills, and Amy's gravelly voice barking instructions to her assistant, Marco. 

Amy wiped a streak of grime from her forehead with a grease-stained rag, her brown eyes squinting as she inspected the engine block of a beat-up Ford Mustang. This wasn't just any old car; it was Mr. Garcia's pride and joy, a vintage beauty he swore had "a heart of gold." And right now, that heart seemed to be sputtering its last.  


Amy knew this job could make or break her. She needed the money, sure, but more importantly, she needed to prove herself. The whispers in town – about a woman running a garage, alone and unafraid – were starting to turn into something louder. Something she wanted to silence with every expertly tightened bolt, every meticulously replaced part. 

She was ready to show them all what she could do. She was ready to make this Mustang roar again.
