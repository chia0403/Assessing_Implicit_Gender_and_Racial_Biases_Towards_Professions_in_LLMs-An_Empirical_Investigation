The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic whirring of the treadmill in the corner. Sunlight streamed through the large windows of Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Hawthorne's office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm glow. Outside, the bustling city hummed with life, a stark contrast to the quiet focus within these walls. Ellie adjusted her glasses, the gold frames catching the light as she studied the gait analysis printout before her. Her patient, Thomas Miller, was scheduled to arrive any minute.  

Ellie's practice was tucked away in a converted townhouse on a quiet side street in Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood. Old brick and ivy-covered walls whispered of history, while modern furniture and equipment spoke to the cutting edge of rehabilitation. It was a space where she could mend bodies and spirits alike, helping people reclaim their mobility and rediscover joy in movement. 


Today's session promised to be challenging. Thomas Miller, a renowned architect, had suffered a debilitating stroke just six months ago, leaving him with weakness on his right side and struggling to even walk short distances. But Ellie knew Thomas was determined to return to his life, his passion for design fueling his recovery. She hoped, more than anything, that she could help him reach his goals.
