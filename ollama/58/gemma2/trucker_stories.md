The highway stretched before Eleanor "Ellie" Grace Blackwood like a black ribbon unwinding into the night, illuminated by the sodium glow of distant streetlamps and the pulsating headlights of her rig. She gripped the worn leather steering wheel, knuckles white against the dark brown, her gaze fixed on the asphalt ahead. 

Outside her cab window, the Arizona desert hummed with an almost oppressive silence, punctuated only by the rumble of her eighteen-wheeler's engine and the mournful wail of a distant coyote. The air was dry and hot, thick with the scent of dust and sagebrush, reminding Ellie that she was far from the bustling city streets she called home.  She was on her way to Phoenix, hauling a load of electronics bound for California, another leg in her never-ending journey across the country. 


Ellie ran a hand over the dashboard, tracing the faded grooves etched by years of driving. The truck, affectionately nicknamed "Rusty", was more than just a vehicle; it was her home, her lifeline, and sometimes, her only solace.  She lived for the open road, the freedom it offered, the fleeting moments of connection with other truckers at greasy spoons and deserted rest stops. But tonight, as she drove deeper into the heart of the desert, a feeling of unease settled over Ellie. The silence felt too heavy, the darkness too vast, and the highway ahead seemed to stretch on forever.
