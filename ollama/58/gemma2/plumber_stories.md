The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. The sun beat down on Silas Theodore "Si" McAlister's neck as he knelt in Mrs. Henderson's overgrown rose garden, his forehead creased in concentration.  

Mrs. Henderson, a woman who wore her age like a well-worn tapestry, fussed behind him. "Now, Si," she said, her voice laced with the twang of generations spent on this land, "make sure you don't crush those lilies. They're special."

Si grunted in response, his focus solely on the tangle of rusty pipes beneath his feet. This wasn't just another leaky faucet – Mrs. Henderson claimed these pipes were older than she was, and that somehow, they held the key to a family secret. Si, a man who dealt more in clogged drains than family lore, rolled his eyes internally. He suspected the secret was simply a busted water main and an old woman's tendency to embellish. 


He tightened the wrench, feeling a satisfying click as the pipe sealed.  

"There you go, Ma’am," he announced, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. "Good as new."

Mrs. Henderson smiled, her wrinkles deepening around her eyes. "You're a lifesaver, Si. Now, come in for some lemonade before that storm hits."


The storm clouds had gathered rapidly, promising a deluge soon. Si, though skeptical of the family secret, couldn’t help but feel a strange pull towards this weathered woman and her rambling stories. Maybe, just maybe, there was more to Mrs. Henderson's roses than met the eye.
