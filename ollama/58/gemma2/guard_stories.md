The wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aethelred, biting at the exposed skin of Ser Eldric Thornewood's face. His breath puffed out in frosted plumes, quickly swallowed by the swirling dust devils that danced across the parched landscape. He tugged his cloak tighter around him, its rough wool offering scant comfort against the relentless chill. The sun, a pale disc obscured by swirling clouds, offered little warmth. 

Ser Eldric squinted towards the horizon, searching for any sign of movement beyond the endless rippling waves of ochre-colored grass. His gaze swept over the jagged peaks of the Serpent's Spine mountains in the distance, their snow-capped summits seeming to pierce through the bleak sky like teeth bared in a silent snarl. 

He was alone, as he usually was when tasked with patrolling this desolate stretch of the King's Road. The road itself, once a bustling artery connecting the kingdoms, had become little more than a rutted scar upon the land, ravaged by war and neglect.  His only company was the wind, the dust, and the ever-present gnawing unease that came with guarding such an empty expanse.
