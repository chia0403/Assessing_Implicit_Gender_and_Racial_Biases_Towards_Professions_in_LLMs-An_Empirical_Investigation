The sun, already a molten disc on the horizon, cast long shadows across the dusty plains of West Texas. The air, thick with the scent of mesquite and creosote, hummed with the drowsy buzz of cicadas.  It was this kind of heat that turned your bones to simmering broth, but for Jebediah "Jeb" Tucker, it was just another day on his family's ranch, Double T Spread. 

Jeb wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, squinting at the horizon where the sky bled into the dusty landscape. His Stetson cast a wide shadow over his weathered face, a face etched with years of hard living under the unforgiving Texas sun. He was a man built like an oak tree – sturdy, resilient, and with roots that ran deep into this land. 

Jeb's gaze shifted to the herd of cattle grazing lazily in the distance, their shaggy coats shimmering in the light. Each beast held a story within its soulful eyes, each moo a whisper of the wildness that still clung to the Texas plains. He knew them all by name – Old Bess, Two-Tooth, and Little Buck – just as he knew the rhythm of the seasons, the whisper of the wind through the mesquite, and the secrets whispered by the night sky. 


But today, a new story was about to unfold. A story that would challenge Jeb's very soul and test the legacy of Double T Spread.
