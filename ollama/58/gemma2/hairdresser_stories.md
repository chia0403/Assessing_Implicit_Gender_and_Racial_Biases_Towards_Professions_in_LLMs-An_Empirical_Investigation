The bell above the door tinkled as Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery swept a stray auburn curl off her client's shoulder. It was 6:45 pm on a Tuesday, the lull before the dinner rush crowd descended upon “Bea’s Brushstrokes,” her little salon nestled in the heart of Maplewood, Ohio. Outside, the late autumn air was crisp and smelled faintly of woodsmoke, but inside Bea's world was warm, scented with lavender shampoo and buzzing with quiet conversation.  

Maplewood was a town where everyone knew their neighbour's name and the gossip travelled faster than a sneeze at a kindergarten playdate. Bea’s salon wasn't just a place for trims and highlights; it was a stage for local drama, a confessional booth, and a haven from the everyday. 


Her current client, Mrs. Eleanor Perkins, was a retired librarian with a penchant for dramatic updos and even more dramatic pronouncements on the state of the world.
