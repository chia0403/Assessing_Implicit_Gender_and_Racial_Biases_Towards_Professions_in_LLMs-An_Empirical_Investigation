The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the "Golden Fish" diner like a thousand angry fists. Neon signs flickered through the deluge, casting an unsettling kaleidoscope of colors across the slick asphalt. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Cartwright, her trench coat dripping onto the worn checkered floor, huddled in a booth by the window. She wasn't there for the greasy burgers or lukewarm coffee, though she wouldn't say no to either. No, Amelia was waiting for a man who smelled like trouble and carried secrets wrapped in whispers. 

This desolate stretch of Route 66 in New Mexico, far from the glittering canyons of Aspen where Amelia usually chased her stories, felt thick with unspoken words. The diner, once a vibrant hub for weary travelers, now stood as a monument to forgotten dreams, its faded glory a testament to the relentless march of time and the capricious nature of fortune.  The kind of place where truth lingered in the steam rising from chipped mugs and the clatter of cutlery against enamel plates. This was where Amelia hoped to find the answer to her latest puzzle: the disappearance of a young woman named Sarah Jenkins, vanished without a trace from this very town six months ago.
