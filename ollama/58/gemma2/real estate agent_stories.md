The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending thunderstorms. A fat raindrop splattered on Amelia Beatrice Harper's nose, followed by another, then a steady drumming on the dusty asphalt driveway leading to the sprawling Victorian mansion before her. It was a beautiful house, undeniably so, but there was a sense of melancholy that clung to it like cobwebs. 

Amelia straightened the crimson silk scarf draped around her neck – a bold counterpoint to the muted greys and greens of the overgrown gardens – and pushed open the wrought iron gate. This wasn't just any listing; this was The Evermore, steeped in local legend and rumoured to be haunted by the heartbroken ghost of its original owner. Amelia Harper, renowned for selling even the most peculiar properties, wasn't fazed. She was here to make a sale, and she had a feeling this house held more secrets than just ghostly whispers.
