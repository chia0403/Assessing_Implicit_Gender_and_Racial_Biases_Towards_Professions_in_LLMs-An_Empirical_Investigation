The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Finch’s head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. Dust motes danced in their pale glow, illuminating the worn linoleum floor and the overflowing ashtrays lining the reception desk. Outside, the late August air hung heavy with humidity, a tangible blanket muffling the distant rumble of traffic on Elm Street. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear and smoothing down the collar of her floral blouse.  It was another sweltering day at Dr. Archibald’s practice, the kind where even the air conditioner seemed to surrender its fight against the oppressive heat. 


The waiting room was eerily quiet, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional cough from Mr. Henderson, a fixture who always sat with his fedora tilted low over his eyes, muttering about the “disrespectful youth.” Eleanor wasn’t sure if he ever actually saw a doctor, or if he simply enjoyed the air conditioning and the endless supply of lukewarm coffee in the chipped china mugs.
