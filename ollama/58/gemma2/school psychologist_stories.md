Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Beatrice Vance's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing within her own mind. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the cluttered desk and overflowing bookshelf crammed with volumes on childhood psychology and trauma therapy. 

Eleanor sat hunched over a file, its contents swirling in front of her eyes like the storm raging outside.  It belonged to twelve-year-old Liam Carter, a boy who’d arrived at Oakwood Elementary just last week, bearing silent wounds and a chillingly vacant stare. In his brief interactions with Eleanor, Liam had offered nothing but monosyllabic answers, his gaze flitting nervously around the room, never settling on her face.  A haunting sense of isolation clung to him, an icy whisper that chilled Eleanor to her core. She knew, instinctively, that beneath Liam's stoic facade lay a story waiting to be unearthed – a story of pain, perhaps, or loss, or something far more sinister.   

Oakwood Elementary, nestled amidst the rolling hills of rural Connecticut, was a place where secrets festered in the shadows like damp roots. Its ivy-covered walls held echoes of whispers and forgotten tragedies, and Eleanor, with her keen intuition and dedication to her students, felt herself drawn into their hidden depths.
