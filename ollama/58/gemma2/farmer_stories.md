The sun hadnâ€™t yet pierced through the indigo curtains of dawn when Elias Thorne nudged awake. He could feel the chill seeping in from under his threadbare quilts, a familiar sting that was as comforting as it was unwelcome.  Elias stretched, bones popping like dry twigs, and took in the sight of his farmhouse kitchen bathed in the soft grey light of pre-sunrise. The scent of woodsmoke still lingered, a testament to the fire he'd banked before sleep claimed him. Outside, the familiar rasp of wind through the barley stalks provided a melancholic soundtrack to his morning ritual.

Elias lived on Thorne Ridge, a secluded stretch of land nestled in the foothills of the Mistfall Mountains. His farm, passed down through generations of Thornes, was a patchwork quilt of rolling fields and gnarled apple trees, all under constant siege from the ever-present wind that whipped across the ridge, carrying with it whispers of forgotten magic and tales of the mountain's untamed heart.  The land was unforgiving, demanding respect and resilience in equal measure, but it was all Elias had ever known. It was his home, his legacy, and the source of his meager livelihood. 


He rose from his bed, a creaky symphony of joints and worn-down wood, and shuffled towards the hearth where embers still glowed faintly. He knew he had much to do before the sun truly kissed the land.  A new day on Thorne Ridge was a race against time, a constant struggle against the elements and the ever-present hunger for survival.
