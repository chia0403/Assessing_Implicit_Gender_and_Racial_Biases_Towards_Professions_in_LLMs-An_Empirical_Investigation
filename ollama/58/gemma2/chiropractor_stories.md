The flickering neon sign outside Dr. Eleanor Anyaegbunam's office cast long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked asphalt. A thin drizzle hammered against the windows, blurring the streetlights into hazy halos. Inside, the air was warm and smelled faintly of lavender essential oil, a stark contrast to the dreary November night outside. 

Eleanor, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, adjusted the light on the x-ray machine with a sigh. Another late night at "Align & Thrive," her small chiropractic practice nestled between a laundromat and a struggling Thai restaurant in a forgotten corner of Brooklyn. She wasn't complaining. It was quiet here, a far cry from the bustling Manhattan clinic she'd left behind.  She preferred the familiar faces, the genuine connection with people who weren’t just chasing quick fixes or trendy wellness solutions. 


But tonight, the silence felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine. She glanced at the clock – nearly midnight. Just a few more minutes and she could head home to her cozy apartment with its pot of simmering ginger tea and the warm glow of her vintage record player. Then, a sharp rap on the door shattered the quiet.
