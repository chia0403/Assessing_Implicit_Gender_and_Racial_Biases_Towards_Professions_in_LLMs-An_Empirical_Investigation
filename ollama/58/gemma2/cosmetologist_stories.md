The bell above the door to "Blushing Blooms" chimed softly as Amelia Rose Hawthorne ushered in another client for her Saturday morning appointment.  The air hung thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and chamomile toner, battling against the faint aroma of cinnamon buns wafting from the bakery across the street. Amelia inhaled deeply, relishing the familiar comfort of her bustling salon nestled on a quiet, tree-lined street in Charleston's historic district. 

Sunlight streamed through the large bay windows, casting a warm glow over the vintage vanity mirrors and antique hairdressing chairs.  Amelia surveyed the scene with a practiced eye – perfectly arranged bouquets of wildflowers graced each counter, hand-stitched cushions adorned the chairs, and a soft jazz playlist filled the air. Her salon wasn't just about haircuts and blowouts; it was an escape, a haven for those seeking beauty and tranquility amidst the whirlwind of life.

Today, though, there was a touch of anxiety beneath the usual calm.  Amelia’s best friend and coworker, Eliza, had suddenly called in sick this morning, leaving Amelia juggling double appointments and a looming deadline for her online tutorials. Despite the pressure, Amelia forced a smile as Mrs. Davenport, a regular with a penchant for bouffants, settled into her chair. 

"Good morning, darling," Amelia chirped, reaching for the styling brush. "How are we feeling today?"


Amelia Rose Hawthorne was about to discover that a simple Saturday morning could quickly unravel into something much more complicated.
