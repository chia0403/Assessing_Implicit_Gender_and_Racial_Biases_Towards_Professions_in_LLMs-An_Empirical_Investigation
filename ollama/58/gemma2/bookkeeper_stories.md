The scent of stale coffee and dusty ledger paper hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia Rose Blackwood. Amelia hunched over her desk, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across the worn wood surface and magnifying the wrinkles etching themselves around her eyes. The clock on the wall ticked with monotonous insistence, each click another tiny hammer blow against the growing tension in Ameliaâ€™s chest. Her fingers flew across the calculator keys, trying to reconcile a discrepancy that felt as vast as the Mississippi itself. Something wasn't adding up, and it wasn't just the numbers.

Amelia worked in the cramped office of Harold Blackwood & Sons, a family business specializing in antique restoration. It was her father's legacy, passed down to her after his untimely passing three years ago. The shop sat tucked away on a quiet street in a bustling seaside town, its faded sign barely visible beneath a tangle of wisteria and ivy. 

The office itself was a microcosm of the town: a bit dusty, slightly chaotic, but with a warmth that came from years of stories whispered between the worn shelves filled with invoices and receipts. But today, that warmth felt distant, replaced by a chill that seeped in with each unanswered question, each line of figures refusing to align.


What Amelia didn't know was that the discrepancy wasn't just a mistake; it was the tip of a tangled web, stretching far beyond the dusty ledger pages and into the heart of her family's history.
