The scent of lavender hung heavy in Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s office, mingling with the faint aroma of burnt coffee from the neglected mug on her desk. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia. Another long day, another parade of anxieties and broken dreams spilling onto her polished mahogany desk. This time, it was a young woman named Maya, clutching a crumpled tissue to her tear-stained face, recounting a love affair that had imploded with the force of a supernova.

Amelia’s office, nestled on the third floor of an old Victorian building in the heart of Boston's Back Bay, was a sanctuary. Bookshelves lined the walls, laden with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and literature, their spines promising solace and insight. A worn armchair sat opposite her desk, its floral upholstery inviting confessions and vulnerabilities. 

Amelia sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She longed to be a lighthouse in Maya’s storm, guiding her towards calmer waters. But lately, Amelia felt like the ship itself was teetering on the brink of capsize.
