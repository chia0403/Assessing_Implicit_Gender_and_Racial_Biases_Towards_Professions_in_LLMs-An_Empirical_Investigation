The air hung thick with dust and the scent of iron-rich earth. Sunlight sliced through the gaps in the corrugated metal roof of Silas Blackwood's workshop, illuminating motes dancing like miniature galaxies. Silas himself was a tapestry woven from years of toil: sun-weathered skin, calloused hands perpetually stained with ochre and grey, eyes that held the glint of both flint and sorrow. He surveyed his workbench, littered with chipped granite slabs, shards of amethyst glittering like fallen stars, and a half-finished carving of a griffin - its wings poised in mid-flight, talons forever frozen just inches from a glistening ruby heart.

Silas's workshop stood on the fringes of Stonehaven, a small village nestled at the foot of the Obsidian Mountains. The mountains themselves were a testament to time and nature's brutal artistry – jagged peaks piercing the clouds, their slopes scarred with centuries of wind and rain. The villagers relied heavily on the obsidian mined from these mountains - its black depths used in everything from tools to weapons, its beauty coveted by merchants far beyond Stonehaven's borders. It was Silas Blackwood, however, who transformed this raw material into art - his carvings sought after for their intricate detail and uncanny lifelike quality. 


This morning, though, a different kind of stone weighed heavily on Silas's mind. A visitor had arrived in the night, bearing news that would forever change Stonehaven – news whispered in hushed tones, carried on the wind like a creeping shadow.
