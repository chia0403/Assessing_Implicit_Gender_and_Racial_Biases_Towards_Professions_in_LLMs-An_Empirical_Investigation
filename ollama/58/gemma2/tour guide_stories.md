The cobblestones beneath Amelia Everly's polished boots gleamed under the harsh glare of midday sun. She adjusted the crimson bandana tied around her head, her smile plastered on as she addressed the gaggle of tourists gathered before her. 

"Welcome, everyone, to Edinburgh!" Her voice, amplified by a small microphone clipped to her lapel, bounced off the ancient stone buildings surrounding them. "Prepare yourselves for a journey through history, mystery, and maybe even a touch of magic!"  

The setting was the heart of the Royal Mile, a bustling thoroughfare teeming with tourists, vendors hawking their wares, and historic landmarks whispering tales of centuries past. Edinburgh Castle loomed above them, a majestic sentinel perched on its craggy hilltop, casting long shadows across the street. 

Amelia's tour group, a motley crew of wide-eyed Americans, curious Japanese families, and seasoned European travelers, buzzed with anticipation. They were here for a glimpse into the city's vibrant past, unaware that Amelia had plans to unveil secrets even her most well-informed colleagues didn't know. 


Amelia winked at them conspiratorially. "Today, we'll be unraveling Edinburgh's hidden stories," she whispered. "Stories that lie beneath the surface, waiting to be discovered."
