The air hung thick with the scent of graphite and stale coffee in the cramped office. Elias Thorne adjusted his spectacles, squinting at the blueprint spread across his drafting table. He traced the lines of the proposed bridge design with a calloused finger, muttering to himself about the ridiculous curve on the eastern span.  

Elias, known by his colleagues as simply “Thorne,” was the resident genius when it came to blueprints. His mind saw the world in lines and angles, translating complex ideas into crisp, clean drawings that made even the most ambitious projects seem achievable.

The bridge project, commissioned by the city council, was proving to be more challenging than anticipated.

But even amidst the gleaming modernity, there's a palpable sense of hardship and struggle. Elias works in a small, cluttered office building tucked away in a forgotten corner of Manhattan.
