The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin as she stepped out of her beat-up Volvo into the blinding midday sun.  Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the fact that the office air conditioning had been cranked up to Arctic levels. She pulled her floral sundress tighter, hoping the fabric would somehow absorb the oppressive heat. Her tiny insurance agency, Hawthorne & Sons (though "Sons" was now just a faded name from a bygone era), sat nestled between a bustling bakery and a dusty antique shop on Main Street in Evergreen, a town where time seemed to move at its own languid pace.  

Amelia took a deep breath, the smell of freshly baked bread mingling with the faint scent of honeysuckle that clung to everything in Evergreen. She adjusted her sensible heels, sighed, and smoothed down her already perfect blonde bob before entering the office, ready for another day battling paperwork, dodging insurance scams, and trying to keep her family's legacy afloat.
