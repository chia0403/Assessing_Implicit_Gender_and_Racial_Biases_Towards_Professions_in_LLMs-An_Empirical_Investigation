The aroma of warm yeast and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill that seeped in through the cracks of Amelia Beatrice Crumb's tiny bakery.  Sunbeams, fractured by the frost-rimmed windows, danced on mounds of flour dusted across her workbench. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Willow Creek were slick with ice, and the wind whispered tales of winterâ€™s approaching grip. But within the warm embrace of "Crumb's Corner," Amelia kneaded dough with a practiced hand, her brow furrowed in concentration as she coaxed life into another batch of sourdough. Her heart, however, wasn't fully in it. This morning,  a shadow hung over Amelia's usually joyful baking ritual - a notice from the bank demanding payment on a loan she simply couldn't afford. The threat of losing her beloved bakery loomed like a storm cloud on the horizon. 


The setting is Willow Creek, a small town nestled in a valley surrounded by snowy peaks. The time is early winter, just as the first snow has begun to fall and the days grow short.
