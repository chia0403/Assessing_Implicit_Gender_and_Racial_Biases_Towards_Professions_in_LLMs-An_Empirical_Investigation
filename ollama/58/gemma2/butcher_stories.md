The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Baxter's Butcher Block," each drop a tiny drumbeat echoing through the dimly lit shop.  Inside, the air was thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy scent of curing meat. Bartholomew Baxter, his hands stained crimson from expertly trimming a side of beef, hummed a tuneless melody under his breath. The butcher's apron he wore, a hand-me-down from his father, bore countless stains – testament to years spent coaxing life out of flesh and offering it to the hungry townsfolk of Oakhaven.  

Oakhaven itself was a town caught between eras - cobblestone streets lined with Victorian houses gave way to storefronts sporting faded neon signs advertising everything from "Diner Delights" to "The Electric Emporium." The air buzzed with a nervous energy, the whispers of progress mingling with the clanging bells of horse-drawn carriages and the steady drone of the newly installed trolley line.   Bartholomew Baxter, however, remained rooted in his traditions, finding solace in the rhythm of the butcher's craft – a symphony of cleavers, saws, and grinders.  But beneath the familiar routine, a tremor of unease stirred. The town was changing, and Bartholomew wasn't sure if he could keep pace.
