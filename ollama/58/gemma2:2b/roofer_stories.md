The relentless rain hammered down on Elias Thorne's worn fedora like a thousand tiny fists.  He hunched deeper over his toolbox, pulling out a set of flashing tools, as if battling a storm within himself. For forty years, he’d lived in the shadow of the colossal steel and glass monolith that pierced the sky, its imposing presence reflecting off his tired eyes. The city below throbbed with life - a cacophony of sirens, car horns, and laughter spilling out onto the streets - but all Elias heard were the drums of the storm and the familiar ache in his joints.

His workshop, cramped and cluttered like a forgotten attic at the edge of time, was Elias’s sanctuary: a place where he could escape the relentless city clamor and rebuild his life after years of working for others. He wasn't much of a man of words, but something about the feel of metal against wood, the rhythmic clang of tools in sync with the downpour, was enough to ground him in this world. 

Tonight, however, the usual solace offered little comfort. His daughter had left again, this time for the city that promised an endless parade of opportunities she couldn’t quite grasp, and he felt the familiar tightness in his chest, a hollow echo of what used to be.  He glanced at the half-finished roof on the unfinished building across the street, its bare structure a stark reminder of the life he could have built with her. He closed his eyes for a moment, and whispered, "Just like that rain, I’ll keep fighting."
