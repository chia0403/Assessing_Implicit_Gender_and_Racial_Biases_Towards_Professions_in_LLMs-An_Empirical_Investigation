The stale air of the grand Blackwood Manor hung heavy, thick with the ghosts of laughter and secrets lost to time. Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne adjusted her worn housecoat, its floral print faded like an old memory, as she navigated the echoing halls.  It was almost dusk in this Victorian mansion, the sun sinking through the dusty chandeliers and casting long shadows that danced on the ornate wallpaper. Ellie's hands, calloused and strong from years of scrubbing floors and wiping down china, gripped a dustpan tightly, her eyes catching a glint of gold at the bottom. 

It was the same glint she'd seen in the reflection of the grand staircase mirror all week, a glint that seemed to follow her like a phantom.  The Blackwood family had been dead for decades, yet their presence felt palpable here. The manor wasn't just a house; it was an entity, its walls whispering tales of love lost and fortunes squandered. Ellie knew this from the way the dust motes swirled in the dying light, the way the portraits on the wall seemed to follow her movements with a silent, haunting stare.  She was the caretaker of Blackwood Manor now, tasked with keeping its secrets buried and its history intact.
