## The Sunken City

**Setting:**  A decaying, sun-drenched port city on the edge of the Atlantic. Buildings scrape the sky, their rusted metal frames reflecting the relentless glare. Salty air hangs thick and heavy, punctuated by the rhythmic screech of gulls circling overhead. This is Salt Haven, a once-thriving industrial hub now clinging to life, its population dwindling with every passing year.

**Character:**  Elias Thorne, a young salesman whose charisma could charm a barnacle off a ship's hull. Elias’ days were filled with navigating the dusty streets of Salt Haven, his briefcase heavy with brochures and sales pitches. He dreamt of bigger things, bigger cities, places where the air was clear and hope still shimmered in the sunlight.

**Story Opening:**  The salt spray stung Elias’ face as he leaned against a crumbling warehouse wall, watching another storm surge roll towards the harbor. His gaze drifted to the boarded-up windows of the old shipyard, where whispers of forgotten dreams lingered in the wind. A shiver ran down his spine. He'd been chasing ghosts for weeks, his sales pitch for "Ocean View Dream Homes" failing to spark any real interest. Tonight, though, a new wave of despair threatened to drown him entirely. 

He flipped open his worn leather briefcase, a familiar weight pressing against his palm. The brochure depicted an idyllic island paradise, white sand beaches and shimmering turquoise water - a vision too beautiful to be true. He'd been hired by the company to sell this dream, but even he wasn't sure if they were selling anything but their own empty promises.  Tonight, however, something about his usual routine felt different. The storm raged around him, echoing the turmoil within.
