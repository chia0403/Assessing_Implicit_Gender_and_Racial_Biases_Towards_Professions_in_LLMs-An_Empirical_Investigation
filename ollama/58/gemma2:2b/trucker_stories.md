The air hung thick with diesel fumes as Clayton "Cally"  Hawkins wrestled his eighteen-wheeler into the deserted rest stop. The sun dipped behind the rusted metal sign depicting a cowboy in a dusty saloon, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt. A lone crow cawed from a broken streetlight, its call echoing through the stillness like a lonely trumpet. Cally slumped onto the worn vinyl of his cab seat, the familiar rumble of his engine a lullaby against the symphony of silence that stretched around him. 

Cally had driven these backroads countless times before, hauling freight between Chicago and Houston.  He was as familiar with the cracked asphalt, faded paintwork, and lonely gas stations on this stretch of highway as he was his own reflection in the mirror. Tonight, though, a different kind of weariness lingered in his bones â€“ a sense of dread that clung to him like the dust kicked up by passing trucks.  Tonight, something wasn't right. It felt heavy, pressing down like a lead apron beneath the weight of his oversized trucker hat.
