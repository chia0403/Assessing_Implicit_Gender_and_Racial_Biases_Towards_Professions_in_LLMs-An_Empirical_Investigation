The faint scent of aged paper and cinnamon filled Amelia's nostrils as she shuffled through the overflowing file cabinet in Mr. Hawthorne's office.  Mr. Hawthorne himself had been out since dawn, leaving a whirlwind of paperwork and a gnawing sense of unease that settled like fog in Amelia's bones. It was her first week as his secretary, replacing a long-time assistant who'd retired with a sudden, almost whimsical grace. 

The office, perched atop the bustling city block filled with coffee shops and vintage bookstores, was a study in old-world charm: velvet drapes, mahogany furniture, a portrait of a stern-looking man in a top hat that seemed to follow her every move. Amelia had never felt so out of place.  Her own world was one of sleek modern desks, ergonomic chairs, and the constant hum of technology - all things Mr. Hawthorne's office seemed to exist outside of. 

**Name:** Amelia Finch
**Setting:** A stately, somewhat eccentric, Victorian-era office building in a bustling city block.
