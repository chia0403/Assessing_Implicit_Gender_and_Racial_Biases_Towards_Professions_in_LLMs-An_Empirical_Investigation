The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, each drop echoing the turmoil within his soul. Rainstorms in the coastal town of Saltwind weren't just about the weather; they were about memories. Memories he couldn't escape, wouldn't let himself touch.  Elias sat hunched over a stack of manila folders, each containing the shattered lives he dealt with daily. 

His office was tucked away on the second floor above Mrs. O’Malley’s bakery, a space that smelled of vanilla and despair in equal measure. It wasn't much, but it was all he had - a haven amidst the storm-tossed lives of his patients. He looked at the face staring back from the photo album: a young woman with hair the color of salt marshes and eyes the shade of ocean foam. 

"Emily," Elias murmured, the name catching in his throat like a trapped bird. "We can't let this go on."  But he knew it was far beyond their shared grief - beyond the loss of someone who'd always been a part of his soul, too much to bear. The storm within him threatened to engulf him entirely.
