The air in Professor Elias Thorne's office hummed with an energy that was more static than life itself. Dust motes danced in the pale sunlight filtering through the grime-coated window, revealing a world he could barely comprehend. Outside, a storm raged; thunder clawed at the windows like the claws of some monstrous beast, and rain lashed against the crumbling brick walls. Inside, Elias sat hunched over his desk, notes scattered around him like fallen leaves in a blizzard. He was a man adrift in an ocean of forgotten knowledge, drowning in the weight of a past he never chose to acknowledge.  

**Setting:** A dusty, neglected Victorian library hidden in the back streets of a decaying industrial city. The remnants of Elias's once vibrant career were strewn across his cluttered desk: crumbling tomes on ancient languages and strange equations scribbled across yellowed paper. The air smelled faintly of aged leather and forgotten promises. 


**Character:** Professor Elias Thorne, an aging scholar who specializes in the arcane history of mythical beasts - a field he abandoned after a personal tragedy. He now struggles with isolation, haunted by ghosts from his past.
