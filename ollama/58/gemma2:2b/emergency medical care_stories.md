The rhythmic beep of the monitor was almost drowned out by the insistent pounding in Amelia's chest.  Her hands, slick with sweat despite the frigid air, danced over the man’s EKG strips, his chart, anything to stave off the growing terror blooming in her stomach.  He was a seasoned firefighter, a veteran of countless blazes and rescues. Now, he lay lifeless in the backseat of an ambulance, his skin clammy, his breath shallow. 

**Name:** Amelia Hayes
**Setting:** The bustling emergency room of Mercy General Hospital in Chicago. Late December, a blizzard raged outside, obscuring the city skyline with swirling snow.  Inside, the air buzzed with a cacophony of beeping machines and frantic voices - a symphony of survival and loss that only an EMT could truly understand. 


**Opening Lines:**

"He was always so strong," Amelia whispered to herself as she knelt beside the man’s limp body. "The kind of guy who built his own fire-escape, then taught it to everyone else." The thought sent a fresh wave of cold through her veins. "We're all just embers, are we not?" 
 
She stared at him, the image of the fire that consumed his life now reflecting in the stark white walls of the ambulance bay. His life, extinguished too soon.  Amelia knew she had to do everything in her power, for everyone, to keep the ember alive. The emergency room door swung open with a dramatic clang. "She's here," came the voice of Nurse Chen, his face as weary as the man lying on the gurney.
