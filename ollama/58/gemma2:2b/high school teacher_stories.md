##  The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  The crumbling grandeur of St. Edmund's Academy - an old boys' school now converted into a mixed-gender boarding academy for gifted students. The campus sits nestled in the rolling hills of rural Vermont, shrouded in perpetual fall leaves and the faint tang of woodsmoke. 

**Character:** Ms. Eleanor Thorne, her name a whisper on the wind as she navigates the labyrinthine hallways and classrooms of St. Edmund's.  Her once vibrant auburn hair is now streaked with silver, framing eyes that hold a deep well of wisdom and something more - an almost uncanny sense of knowing.

**Opening:** The old clock tower chimed nine times, its mournful echoes bouncing off the faded red brick walls. Ms. Thorne stood at her classroom door, watching the students file in like a flock of restless sparrows. Each student brought with them their own story – stories whispered in hushed voices by the whispering walls, echoing with ghosts of those who had walked these halls before them.  

She smiled faintly, tucking a stray curl behind her ear.  "Welcome back," she greeted the class, her voice carrying the weight of years and untold tales. "Ready for another chapter in our journey?"

The students' faces, still drawn from the school bus ride across the state, reflected a mix of exhaustion and anticipation. But Ms. Thorne saw something more – the same spark that once ignited in her own heart, the flicker of curiosity she was eager to ignite within them.
