Rain hammered against the attic window, each drop exploding in miniature fireworks that lit the room for a moment before fading to the deep shadows cast by the dusty furniture.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Thorne, her brow furrowed beneath a mess of blonde curls and exhaustion, wrestled with a digital rendering on her laptop.  She'd been at it all day, every corner of this small, forgotten New England town she called home seemingly shrouded in perpetual twilight.

The project was for the new branch opening of "Artisan Crafts," an up-and-coming artisanal goods store specializing in hand-crafted furniture and d√©cor. Amy was tasked with creating their logo: a play on the natural textures and intricate craftsmanship of the products themselves, something that would capture the heart of each piece while echoing the timeless elegance they offered.  The client, Mr. Davies, had been particularly demanding, wanting a "sophisticated yet rustic" design, which he'd delivered through cryptic notes and an intense stare in their initial meeting. 

The rain continued its relentless assault on the attic roof, a constant reminder of time lost and possibilities that seemed to slip away as she struggled with her digital canvas. Outside, the world blurred into a symphony of grey and green, while inside, Amy found herself staring at the screen, desperately seeking inspiration in the flickering pixels.
