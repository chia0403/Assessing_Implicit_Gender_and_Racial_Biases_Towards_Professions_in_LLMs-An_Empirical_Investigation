The rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of the workshop, each drop echoing like tiny percussionists in the otherwise silent space. Inside, dust motes danced in the beam of Agnes's headlamp as she meticulously inspected blueprints. Her worn blue smock was covered in grease and graphite smudges, her hair pulled back tight to keep it out of her eyes.  Agnes Thorne, draftswoman extraordinaire, felt like a lone sentinel guarding the secrets of the sky. 

The workshop itself was an island of steel and wood amidst the sprawling city of Atheria. It had been built generations ago, weathered by time and storms, but still holding onto its rugged charm. Its doors swung open with a groan that seemed to amplify the rhythm of the rain, welcoming Agnes into her sanctuary.  Her fingers traced the curves of a model skyscraper, its steel skeleton shimmering in the dim light. This wasn't just drafting; this was dreaming, bringing dreams to life. But today, something felt different - an undercurrent of unease hummed beneath the usual rhythmic cadence of creation.
