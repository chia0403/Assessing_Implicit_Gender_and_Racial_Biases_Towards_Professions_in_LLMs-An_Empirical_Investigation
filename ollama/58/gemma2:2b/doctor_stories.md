The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air like an unwelcome shroud, clinging to Dr. Eleanor Vance's crisp white coat. Outside the sterile windows of St. Vincent's Hospital, rain hammered against the glass, mirroring the storm brewing within her chest.  

Eleanor had always been drawn to the quiet chaos of a hospital ward. The weight of human life pressed upon her like a silent symphony, each patient a different note in the grand orchestra of mortality. Tonight, however, she was battling a dissonance of her own – a growing unease about a new patient, a young man named Thomas whose injuries were eerily similar to those of another patient who had died only hours before. His eyes, wide and panicked, reflected the same fear that haunted her dreams. 

The room was dim, lit by an array of flickering monitors and a harsh fluorescent light. A metallic hum filled the air from the heart monitor strapped to Thomas's chest, its rhythm a steady beat against the background din of the night. Eleanor walked towards him cautiously, each step muffled by the thick carpet and her own racing thoughts. The air in the room felt thick with unspoken questions, and she knew she had a choice to make – either confront the growing fear, or let it fester like an unhealed wound.
