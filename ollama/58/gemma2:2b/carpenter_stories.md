The air hung thick with the scent of pine and sawdust as Elias Thorne meticulously measured each board for his latest project. His workshop, nestled amongst the rambling cottages of Old Harbor, was a symphony of wood shavings and rhythmic rasps, but it always felt quieter to him than any other place in the world. The soft hum of the old ceiling fan was a soothing balm against the anxieties that churned beneath his surface - anxieties he would often drown out with his woodworking, turning rough planks into something beautiful, something strong. 

Old Harbor, with its cobblestone streets and crooked houses clinging to the hillside, had been Eliasâ€™s home for as long as he could remember. The rhythm of the ocean waves a constant pulse beneath his feet, while the seagulls' cries painted a soundtrack to every moment. His father had taught him everything about carpentry - how to read the grain of wood like an ancient text, and how to coax life into each knot with just his hands. He felt a quiet kinship with the trees that he felled, each tree a whisper of stories untold before being transformed into something new.
