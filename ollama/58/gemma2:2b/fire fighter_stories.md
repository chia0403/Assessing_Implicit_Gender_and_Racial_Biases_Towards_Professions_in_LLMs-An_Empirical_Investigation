The air hung thick and greasy with smoke, each breath a rasping reminder of the inferno that raged just beyond the charred frame of their station house.  Rain lashed down on Chief Ethan Walker's worn leather coat as he scanned the ravaged landscape below from the rooftop of the old, crumbling firehouse. The flames danced across the night sky like malevolent stars, twisting and snarling in a symphony of destruction.

Ethan had spent his career battling these infernos; twenty years, more than most, etching a path through the heart of urban chaos, where steel was forged into ash, dreams were consumed by heat, and life itself was measured in seconds. This wasn't his usual routine -  the city had been hit with an unprecedented storm surge, followed by a devastating firestorm that left a trail of charred memories and shattered lives in its wake. The wind whipped through the wreckage, carrying with it the acrid scent of burnt timber, gasoline, and something else - something unsettlingly familiar. 

A small flicker caught his eye from the swirling smoke, a beacon amidst the chaos. It was a single orange glow, barely discernible in the darkness.  Hope sparked within him, a sliver of light against the encroaching night. Ethan gripped the brim of his helmet tighter and took a deep breath. He was needed. The inferno had a name, one that resonated with the echoes of every lost soul: "The Widow's Flame."
