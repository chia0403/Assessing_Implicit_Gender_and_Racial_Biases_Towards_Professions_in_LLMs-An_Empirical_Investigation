The morning air in Meadowbrook was thick with dew and honeysuckle, clinging to Amelia Bellwether's worn overalls as she surveyed her charges. The sun rose like a drowsy orange over the sprawling farm, painting the fields in hues of gold and crimson. Amelia, known throughout the community as "Aunt Millie" for her warmth and boundless love for all creatures great and small, took a deep breath, the scent of hay and freshly turned earth filling her lungs. 

Amelia's job wasn't just tending to the farm animals; it was caring for each one like they were part of her family. From the gentle giants - Angus, the old boar with eyes that held years of wisdom, and Poppy, the playful pony who pranced about her paddock with an exuberance that never failed to lift Amelia's spirits,  to the delicate sparrows who chirped their morning greetings from the feeders, every being was cherished. 

This morning, however, felt different. The air hummed with a strange tension, and even the normally cheerful birds seemed subdued. A storm, brewing on the horizon for days, promised to unleash its wrath upon Meadowbrook soon, leaving Amelia's heart heavy with foreboding.
