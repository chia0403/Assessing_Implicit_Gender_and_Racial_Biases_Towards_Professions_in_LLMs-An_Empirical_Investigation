But right now, everything felt as chaotic as a hurricane's aftermath, a swirling mess of red flags and panicked whispers echoing through the silent office. He was staring down a storm unlike any he had faced before, a storm with the potential to wash away his reputation, his lifeâ€™s work, and everything that mattered.
