The flickering fluorescent lights of "H&R Block 208" buzzed like angry bees as Amelia Reyes straightened her hair in the reflection of the greasy metal filing cabinet. A low hum emanated from the aging computer that sat beside the filing machine, seemingly holding its breath as it awaited another taxpayer's soul to be sucked into its digital maw. 

It was February, and the air hung thick with a perpetual drizzle of tax forms, all vying for Amelia's attention. The aroma of stale coffee and peppermint gum filled the cramped office, punctuated by the quiet clatter of keyboards and a woman's exasperated sigh that occasionally shattered the symphony of filing. 

Amelia had never found joy in her work, but she knew it was more than just tax forms and spreadsheets to her. It was a life raft in a sea of bills, a shield against the harsh realities of an unpredictable world, and an echo of hope for those who came through her door, each story a silent prayer for financial sanity.  Her name on the worn, handwritten sign above the office door read “A Reyes, Income Tax Prep.”
