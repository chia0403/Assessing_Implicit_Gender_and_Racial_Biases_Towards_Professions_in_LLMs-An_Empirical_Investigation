The fluorescent hum of the shop seemed to vibrate in Theodore "Teddy" Barnes's teeth as he stepped onto the worn, concrete floor.  The aroma of ozone and pine needles, his specialty, hung heavy in the air, clinging to the walls like a childhood memory. It was Friday night, the quiet after the rush of Wednesday's storm had passed, and Teddy’s workshop, "Barnes & Sons" - passed down through generations of electricians - felt both familiar and alien. The worn tools hanging from the rafters, each bearing its own tale of countless projects completed, whispered tales of lives lived and families built in his hometown of Pine Ridge. 

Teddy had always found solace in the tangible world around him. The steady rhythm of the power saw, the satisfying click of a circuit breaker as it flipped, these were the languages he spoke – not spoken, but felt, understood like an old friend. His eyes, hardened by years spent chasing down faulty wiring and solving complex problems, scanned the workshop with practiced ease. There was a quiet urgency in his gaze, a yearning to find the spark of something new - a project that would set him apart from the countless other electricians who plied their trade across the state.  

Tonight's challenge, however, seemed to be one he couldn't quite decipher – an aged radio tower looming like a silent sentinel in his mind. He ran a calloused hand over the dusty blueprints spread out on his workbench.
