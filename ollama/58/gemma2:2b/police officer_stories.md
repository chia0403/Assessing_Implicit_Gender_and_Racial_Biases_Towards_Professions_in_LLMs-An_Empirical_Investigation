## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the grimy window of Officer Riley "Ace"  McCall's patrol car, blurring the flickering streetlights into impressionist swirls of yellow and red. The only sound louder than the storm was the relentless thrumming of his nerves; a cocktail of apprehension and fatigue swirling in his gut. He'd been on the beat for six hours now, chasing shadows and whispered confessions in the smoky back alleys of Hell’s End, hoping to catch a glimmer of something resembling justice in this city’s underbelly.

Hell's End was as much a nickname as it was a description – a sprawling metropolis of forgotten souls where the law was just another excuse for someone else to take advantage. The air itself seemed thick with tension; an unseen hand pushing and pulling, threatening to break free from its chains. Ace pulled his heavy coat tighter around himself, the synthetic material offering little protection against the biting November wind that whipped through the deserted streets. 

His radio crackled to life, cutting through the howling symphony of the storm. "Ace, you're wanted at precinct. Chief wants to see you," barked Officer Johnson, his voice thick with an unsettling calm. Ace sighed, a knot tightening in his chest. This wasn't good, not by a long shot.
