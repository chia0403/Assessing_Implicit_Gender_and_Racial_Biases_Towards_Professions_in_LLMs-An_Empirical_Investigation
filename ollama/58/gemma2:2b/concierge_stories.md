Rain lashed against the windows of the opulent Plaza Grand Hotel, a symphony of icy needles against glass.  Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the grand foyer, casting warm, orange flames across the plush carpet and echoing through the polished marble walls. The air was thick with the scent of cinnamon and woodsmoke from the holiday decorations strung around the ornate chandelier – a stark contrast to the relentless storm outside. 

Evelyn Thorne, her black hair pulled back tight from her face in a severe bun, checked the guest list on her tablet. She wasn't supposed to be working tonight. Tonight was the annual Winter Solstice Gala – one of the most prestigious events held in this city, and she was scheduled off for an entire week's vacation. But as always, things came up.

Evelyn had worked at the Plaza Grand Hotel for ten years, ever since she graduated college with a degree in hospitality management. She knew each corner, every creak of the floorboards, every nook and cranny of this timeless landmark.  She was more than just a concierge; she was a silent guardian, the orchestrator of smooth interactions between guests and the hotel's intricate machinery, navigating guests through their anxieties and desires with the practiced ease of a seasoned diplomat. Tonight, however, a storm raged inside her too, mirroring the chaos outside.  Her sister, Lily, had called about an hour ago – Lily, who was expecting her first child. Evelyn knew it wasn’t just the stress of labor that troubled her; it was knowing how much this new chapter held for them both.
