The rain hammered against the windowpane like angry fists, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Elias Thorne's mind. He stared out at the desolate landscape of Seattle's waterfront - a concrete jungle punctuated by flickering neon signs and the occasional lonely boat bobbing in the harbor. Elias was used to the city's grim beauty, its layers of grime and despair, but tonight it seemed to be suffocating him, mirroring his own growing unease about the case before him.

He rubbed his eyes, hoping to banish the fatigue that had settled like a shroud over him. He could still see the last remnants of his patient's face - a distorted mask of fear and confusion, etched onto the canvas of her worn-out, porcelain skin. He’d spent weeks with Mrs. Evelyn Hayes, deciphering the intricate tapestry of her fractured mind, attempting to untangle the threads of her memories and unravel the secrets hidden within them. 

His fingers unconsciously tightened around a worn photo – a faded picture of a woman smiling brightly, her face illuminated by the light of a setting sun.  Evelyn’s case was unique, a baffling mix of psychopathy, grief, and perhaps even a hint of something else he could barely define. He'd spent countless hours analyzing every facet of Evelyn's life, searching for the key that would unlock the truth behind her brutal actions. The weight of his task pressed down on him like a physical burden.  

Tonight, he’d hoped to get some clarity from the woman’s family, hoping their insights would reveal something vital. He knew they held secrets close, and tonight was the night he would try to pry them open.
