The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air as Evelyn "Eve" Thorne meticulously checked her IV drip.  Outside the hospital windows, snow danced across the asphalt, swirling into an ethereal symphony with the wind's mournful howl. The city lay shrouded in a quiet blanket of winter, its normally bustling heart muted to a whisper of frost and hushed whispers from tired residents. Eve was alone –  she’d been for days – lost in the labyrinth of a pandemic ward on Level 4. Her shift had just ended, but her mind, restless like an anxious bird, wouldn't settle.  

The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows over the faces of the patients: skeletal fingers gripping flimsy blankets, eyes glazed with exhaustion and pain. Eve's heart throbbed in her chest, a constant drumbeat of worry for each patient. Today’s reports had been brutal - another spike in infections, more deaths than hope could offer.  

Eve’s phone buzzed on the bedside table, the familiar blue glow of the screen cutting through the stark white of the ward. It was Dr. Ramirez, her supervisor, demanding an update on Patient 78, whose condition had deteriorated rapidly. Eve sighed; another day in this frozen wasteland, another soul fading away under the weight of a relentless illness that threatened to consume them all.
