The fluorescent lights hummed above Arthur Delacroix's head like a tired swarm of cicadas. He chewed on his pen nervously, trying to decipher the labyrinthine logic of a spreadsheet that had more lines than a taxidermied squirrel. The year was 1985, and even the smell of stale coffee in Arthur's tiny office hadn't been able to escape the weight of his soul. Not when he was staring down the barrel of Mrs. Peabody's latest tax dispute - an issue as complex as a double-entry system in a Kafkaesque dream. 

Arthur Delacroix, meticulous and earnest in his own way, was a man obsessed with order.  He lived by a strict regimen of routines and a diet of meticulously organized bills and receipts. He believed that life's chaos could be tamed, its complexities understood through the elegant language of numbers. But even he couldn't deny the growing dissonance in his soul as he wrestled with Mrs. Peabody's tax return - the discordance of her late-blooming entrepreneurial spirit, a jarring symphony against his carefully constructed world of balance sheets and receipts.  The air hung heavy with a silent tension that seemed to amplify the hum of the fluorescent lights above him.
