The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and cheap perfume as Thomas, "Tommy" Bell, checked his reflection in the polished chrome of the elevator's control panel. He ran a hand through his thinning hair, the faint buzz of his electric razor echoing against the high-pitched whine of the machinery. The Grand Majestic Hotel shimmered in its usual splendor, a beacon of glamour amidst the gritty underbelly of Chicago's Loop. Tonight, though, it felt different. A palpable tension hung heavy over the normally jovial atmosphere. 

Tommy was used to the ebb and flow of life at the Grand: from the boisterous couples clamoring for privacy to the weary travelers seeking refuge in the lobby's opulent warmth. But this night, a strange unease settled upon him, prickling his skin like static electricity. A sense of foreboding lingered over the polished floors and gleaming chandeliers. Tonight, the air felt thick with secrets, whispers of something sinister that Tommy had yet to decipher.

He adjusted the worn leather of his bellhop uniform, the crispness a stark contrast to the unsettling stillness around him. He felt it as he took his usual post by the grand oak doors, an unspoken feeling in the air.
