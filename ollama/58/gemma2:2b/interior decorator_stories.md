The scent of beeswax polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of old books and dust.  Eleanor "Ellie" Winthrop III adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses, squinting at the sun-drenched floorboards of the Victorian mansion. This wasn't just any project - it was a legacy. Ellie had inherited her grandmother's renowned interior design firm, 'Winthrop & Co.' with all its faded grandeur and unspoken expectations. 

The sprawling house sat perched on a hill overlooking the emerald green expanse of Lake Champlain. Its once opulent rooms now held the weight of years. Every chipped paint splatter on the mahogany desk, every creak in the antique chandelier spoke of forgotten parties, whispered secrets, and hushed tears. Ellie inhaled deeply, her heart thrumming with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. This was where dreams were built, not just re-imagined.

Today's assignment: Mrs. Caldwell's sunroom. A space choked by the weight of floral wallpaper and dusty draperies - a testament to a life lived in muted hues and quiet loneliness. Ellie envisioned a symphony of color and light pouring into the room through her carefully curated lens. It would be a balm for Mrs. Caldwell, who was said to have lost her husband ten years ago and had retreated behind the walls of her own sorrow.
