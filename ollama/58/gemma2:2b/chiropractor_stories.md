The afternoon sun beat down on Willow Creek, its warm rays turning the small town’s cobbled streets into shimmering ribbons of gold.  Inside Dr. Arthur "Ari" Blackwood's practice, a cool breeze blew in from the open windows. Ari, with his tousled silver hair and weathered face etched by years spent bending and stretching human bodies to ease their aches, sat adjusting a patient's spine, humming a quiet melody as he worked. 

Willow Creek was a place where time seemed to move slower, its residents content with simple pleasures:  a cup of Earl Grey tea on a porch swing, the scent of freshly baked pie wafting from Mrs. Peabody's kitchen, and the soft strumming of the old guitar in the local café. For Ari, who had built his practice on the bedrock of gentle hands and compassionate care, it was a haven. But even here, amidst the warmth of human connection, a chill wind seemed to stir beneath his skin. A tremor in the air, an unease he couldn't quite name. The familiar serenity of Willow Creek felt different today, like a whisper of something amiss.
