## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** A cozy cottage nestled in the heart of Redwood Forest, Oregon, nestled between towering redwoods and cascading ferns. 


**Character:** Amelia “Amy” Rosethorn - a kind-faced woman with eyes that shimmer like dewdrops on moss after a summer rain. She’s been working as a childcare worker for the last fifteen years, her life revolving around the well-being of the children under her care.


**Opening:**

The sun dipped below the redwood canopy, painting long streaks of orange and violet across the floorboards of the living room. Amy hummed softly, rocking little Liam in his worn baby swing with a gentle smile etched on her face.  Liam's tiny hands clutched at nothing in particular, his eyes fluttering as he drifted to sleep. 

But tonight, the silence felt different. An unnatural quiet permeated the room, thick like dust after a long summer drought. It wasn't just the absence of Liam's happy babbling - a sound that was almost as constant as the rustle of leaves outside. The house held its breath, every creak and groan punctuated by an eerie hum, barely audible yet insistent.

It had been happening more often lately, Amy thought.  The walls seemed to whisper in this gentle breeze, echoing stories from forgotten years, tales of laughter and tears, dreams woven into the very fabric of the old house. Tonight, though, it felt different. The whispers were louder, heavier, filled with a sense of unease that tightened Amy's chest. 

She looked out the window, at the forest bathed in twilight. A single raven perched on a branch, its obsidian eyes staring directly into her own.  The air was still, even the wind seemed to hold its breath. The house held its secrets close tonight.
