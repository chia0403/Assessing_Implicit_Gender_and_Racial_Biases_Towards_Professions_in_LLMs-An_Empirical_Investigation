The mist clung to the pines like ghostly fingers, obscuring the usual tapestry of sun-dappled green that blanketed the forest floor.  Rain hammered against the canvas tarp of Elias Croft's truck, doing little to quell the chill gnawing at his bones. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a perfume he'd been born into and yet found strangely unsettling on this particular morning. It had already been two weeks since his father's passing, and still, Elias felt adrift, like a log tossed onto a churning river without an anchor to hold him steady. 

He was just about to set out for the usual timber stand when a flicker of movement caught his eye in the dense undergrowth near the creek. It was a flash of brilliant blue, and he instinctively knew that whatever it was, it wasn't meant to be found there.  It wasn't like anything he'd ever seen before.
