Rain lashed against the windows of "The Iron Lily", its mournful symphony clashing with the frantic beeping of the EKG machine beside Amelia's station. She stared at the monitor, her heart sinking like the leaden weight she was about to draw from an elderly man named Mr. Evans.  He looked frail, translucent even, in the dim clinic light. Her name was Amelia Thorne, and for twenty years, she’d been a skilled phlebotomist, adept at navigating the sometimes-violent dance between needles and veins with the quiet precision of a surgeon. 

Tonight, however, the usual calm was missing. Mr. Evans' pulse, though steady enough, pulsed with an anxiety that seemed to seep into her very soul.  The rain, the man’s discomfort – it all added to the oppressive weight in Amelia's chest. The irony wasn't lost on her; she felt like a captive of fate herself, trapped within the confines of this small clinic as she waited for the storm outside to break. 

Across from her sat a young intern, nervously fidgeting with his stethoscope. "Ready, Miss Thorne?" he asked, his voice tinged with hesitant optimism. The air hung thick with unspoken tension and Amelia swallowed hard, pushing back the creeping nausea.  She wasn't ready for this night. But she had to be. 


**Setting:** A small, cozy clinic tucked away on a side street in a rainy city. It's decorated with muted floral patterns and warm, soft lighting, but the rain outside makes it seem perpetually damp and melancholic.

**Main Character:** Amelia Thorne -  A seasoned phlebotomist who has worked at "The Iron Lily" for years, showing unwavering compassion towards her patients while navigating her own emotional storms.
