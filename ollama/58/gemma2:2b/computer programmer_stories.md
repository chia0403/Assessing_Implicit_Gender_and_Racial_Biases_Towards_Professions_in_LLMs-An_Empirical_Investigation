The year was 2047, and Elias wasn’t just dealing with another Monday; he was trying to wrangle a digital beast – one that had escaped its confines within an obscure cryptocurrency algorithm and now threatened to unravel the very fabric of the internet.

His fingers flew across the keyboard, his eyes burning into lines of code that pulsed with an unsettling energy. The air hummed with static and fear as Elias’s anxieties mirrored the spiraling chaos in his digital battlefield.
