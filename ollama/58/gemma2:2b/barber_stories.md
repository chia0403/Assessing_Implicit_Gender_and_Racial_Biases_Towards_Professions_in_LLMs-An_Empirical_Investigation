The air in The Snip was thick with the scent of hair tonic, sawdust, and nervous anticipation. It wasn't usually this way - the old barbershop always had its quiet rhythm, but tonight was different.  A storm raged outside, lashing rain against the windowpanes like a thousand tiny hammers. Within its walls, however, young Bartholomew "Bart" Hemmings, with his thick, dark eyebrows and even thicker sense of empathy, held court over three worried men in armchairs.

Bart, at twenty-two years old, was already known as one of the most gifted barbers in the city. His hands moved like a surgeon's, each snip precise, every trim a work of art. Tonight, however, he was dealing with more than just the usual haircuts. It was his first time helping Mr. Grimshaw, the town’s esteemed but notoriously grumpy mayor, face the music after years of ignoring his beard.  His hair had grown unruly, a tangled mess that resembled a wildcat's fur coat; a reflection of Grimshaw’s own prickly demeanor and unyielding control over the townsfolk.
