The morning air hung heavy with oil and diesel fumes in Arlo Vance's garage. His hands, calloused from years of wrenching and tinkering, worked on a rusty '74 Ford Falcon, its engine coughing like a smoker trying to quit for the tenth time.  Arlo wasn't just any auto mechanic; he was the man who breathed life back into forgotten relics, turning clunking machines into roaring beasts with his skilled touch. His workshop, crammed with spare parts and tools more than a hundred years old, was a testament to his stubborn love for machinery. 

The sun, a pale disc through the smoke and grime of the garage ceiling, cast long shadows as Arlo tightened a bolt on the Falcon's engine. The car had come in yesterday, abandoned by its owner - a grumpy old man who swore he "never needed no fancy mechanics" before his life got tangled up in a web of bills and bad decisions. Now, with each click and clank of the wrench, Arlo felt a sense of purpose stir within him. This wasn't just about fixing cars; it was about giving these forgotten machines a second chance to roar through the open road, a journey that mirrored his own desire to find meaning amidst the gears and cogs of life.
