The air hung thick and heavy with humidity, clinging to Elias "Eli" Carter's face like a wet blanket. The sun, barely dipping behind the haze-choked horizon, cast the steel beams of the bridge over them in an eerie glow.  He squinted at the flickering amber light on his headlamp, focusing on the jagged line where the old concrete was giving way to the new asphalt. It was just like the old man said â€“ a job that wouldn't be finished before tomorrow's sunrise. 

Eli was used to these endless stretches of highway work, each day blending into the next in the same monotonous fashion. The rhythmic thrum of his jackhammer, the distant rumble of trucks on the adjacent road, and the endless drone of cicadas - it was a symphony that played out under the indifferent gaze of the vast American sky. 

He pulled out another cigarette from his worn pouch and lit it with a sigh, letting the smoke curl around him like a lonely ghost. This bridge wasn't just any job; it was more than work to Eli. It was legacy. His father, who had built this very bridge before him, before even his own children were born, would have been proud. But the weight of expectation, the pressure to live up to his father's name and reputation, was starting to wear on Eli.  He needed a break. 


**Setting:** A remote highway interchange in the American Midwest. The bridge over a bustling, but quiet highway is under construction.

**Character:** Elias "Eli" Carter, a young highway worker whose legacy hangs heavy on his shoulders.
