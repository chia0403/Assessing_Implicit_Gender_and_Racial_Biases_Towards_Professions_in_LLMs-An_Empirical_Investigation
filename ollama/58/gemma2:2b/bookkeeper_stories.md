Rain lashed against the high windows of Mrs. Eleanor Everly's accounting firm, blurring the gaslight glow into an impressionistic swirl of orange and gray. Inside, amidst the scent of aged paper and cinnamon candles, Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne diligently entered ledger entries, her thin pencil scratching across the worn parchment with a quiet rhythm.  

Her life was predictable, even routine. Every day at 8:00 AM, she sat before the oak desk that had belonged to her grandmother – a silent testament to generations of Everlys who’d kept their family finances in perfect order. But today, for some reason that Amy couldn't quite place, the rhythmic click of the pencil seemed louder than usual.  The rain outside echoed an unspoken tension in the air, and Amy felt it prickling at the back of her neck, as if a strange current was stirring within the ancient brick walls of Mrs. Everly’s building. 

Her eyes, though tired from days of balancing intricate spreadsheets and recording income statements, were suddenly drawn to a new client's name on the ledger – “The Blackwood Estate.” The air grew noticeably colder in the room, and for just a second, Amy swore she saw movement in the corner of her eye.  Was it merely a trick of the flickering gaslight, or was there something else within those shadowed corners?
