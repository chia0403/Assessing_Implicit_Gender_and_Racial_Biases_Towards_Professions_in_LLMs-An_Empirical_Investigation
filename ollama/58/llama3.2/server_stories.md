As the sun set over the bustling city of New Haven, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded streets and restaurants, Amabelle Rose Thompson stood at the hostess stand, surveying the long line of diners waiting to be seated at the popular bistro, "Bella Vita". The sound of sizzling pans and lively chatter filled the air as Amabelle's mind wandered to her upcoming shift, and the mountain of reservations that had been pouring in all week.

Amabelle, a 25-year-old server with a warm smile and a quick wit, had worked at Bella Vita for three years, learning the ins and outs of Italian cuisine and charming diners from all walks of life. She took pride in her work, always striving to exceed expectations and make every guest feel like family.

As she scanned the reservation book, Amabelle's eyes landed on a familiar name: Mr. Jenkins, a regular who came in every Thursday night for his famous prime rib dinner. She smiled to herself, anticipating their usual banter and jokes about her cooking skills (or lack thereof). Little did she know, tonight would be different. Tonight, Mr. Jenkins would arrive with a mysterious guest, one that would shake up the evening's routine and test Amabelle's skills in ways she never thought possible.
