Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast, open plains of rural Wyoming, casting a warm orange glow over the rusty red earth and the rows of towering oil rigs that stretched out as far as the eye could see. In the small town of Willow Creek, just a few miles from the rigs, a lone figure sat atop his trusty Caterpillar 345F crawler excavator, taking in the breathtaking view.

Meet Jedediah "Jed" Thompson, a rugged and experienced heavy equipment operator with over a decade of experience under his belt. With his thick beard and weathered skin, Jed was as much at home on the rig as he was in his own worn jeans and faded trucker hat. He had worked on some of the biggest oil fields in the country, from Texas to North Dakota, but there was something about this particular site that drew him back time and again.

As he scanned the horizon, Jed's trained eye picked out the telltale signs of an impending storm - dark clouds gathering on the horizon, a faint scent of ozone in the air. He knew better than to stick around when the weather turned nasty, but he also knew that this was his favorite time of day, the moment before the chaos began.

Little did Jed know, however, that today would be different from all the others. Today, his routine would be disrupted by a mysterious phone call, one that would set him on a course that would take him far beyond the confines of the oil field and into the depths of a sinister conspiracy...
