Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Ravenswood, where the mist-shrouded streets were lined with towering oak trees that seemed to whisper secrets to each other in the wind. The local news station, WTRV, had just received word that the infamous Ravenswood Manor, long abandoned and rumored to be cursed, was being reacquired by its wealthy owner, Mr. Edward Blackstone.

A determined look etched itself onto her features, her bright green eyes gleaming with anticipation.
