Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a cozy little house on Elm Street, 25-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson was finishing up her shift at the local daycare center, "Little Explorers."
