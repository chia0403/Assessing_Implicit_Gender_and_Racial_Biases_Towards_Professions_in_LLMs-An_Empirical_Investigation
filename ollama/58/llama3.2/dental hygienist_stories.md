Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she stepped out of the misty morning air and into the warm glow of her practice, Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction wash over her. The sign above the door read "SmileWorks," and the smell of mint and coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of gentle chatter from her waiting patients.

Lexi had always loved this part of her day – before the chaos of appointments and emergencies took hold, when it was just her, the quiet morning light, and the promise of a new day full of smiles. She took a deep breath, feeling the tension in her shoulders ease as she began to prep for another busy day of keeping teeth clean and healthy.

The practice itself was cozy, nestled between a vintage clothing store and a bustling café in the heart of downtown. Lexi had inherited it from her grandmother, who had been a pioneering dentist in their small town. Over the years, she'd worked tirelessly to restore the building's original charm while modernizing its equipment and services.

As Lexi made her way through the crowded waiting area, exchanging warm smiles with familiar faces and greeting newcomers with a firm handshake, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the sense of unease that lingered in the air, like the faintest hint of smoke on a summer day – though that was certainly present too.

It was more like...a nagging thought at the back of her mind, one that refused to be silenced by the gentle rhythms of her morning routine. A feeling that something was waiting for her just beyond the edge of perception, hiding behind the gleaming surfaces and well-manicured smiles of her patients.

And then, as she began to make her rounds, checking charts and prepping instruments with practiced ease, Lexi caught a glimpse of herself in the mirror that hung above the reception desk. Her eyes met hers, and for an instant, she could have sworn she saw something there – a flicker of uncertainty, perhaps, or even fear.

But when she looked again, it was gone, leaving her staring back at her own reflection with a sense of quiet unease that lingered long after the moment had passed.
