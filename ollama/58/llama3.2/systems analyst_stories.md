Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glowed like a wet canvas under the dim glow of streetlights as Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her apartment building, sipping on a lukewarm coffee from the cup she'd been nursing for the past hour. As a systems analyst at the tech giant, NovaTech, Lexi was no stranger to late nights and endless deadlines, but tonight felt different. Maybe it was the eerie feeling that settled in the pit of her stomach as she gazed up at the towering skyscrapers, their windows like empty eyes staring back.

Lexi had always loved the city's gloomy charm, but lately, the grey skies seemed to match her own mood. She'd been working non-stop on a top-secret project for months, trying to meet an impossible deadline with a new AI-powered system that promised to revolutionize the way companies managed their resources. But as she trudged through the downpour, Lexi couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside her, like a slow-burning fire waiting to erupt.

As she walked towards the bus stop, Lexi's phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, expecting a text from her colleague or maybe even a message from her best friend, Rachel, but instead, she saw an unknown number flashing on the screen: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone." The words sent a shiver down Lexi's spine. Who was this, and what did they want with her?
