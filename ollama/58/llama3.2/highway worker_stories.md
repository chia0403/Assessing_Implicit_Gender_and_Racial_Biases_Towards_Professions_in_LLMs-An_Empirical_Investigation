Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Texas desert, casting a golden glow over the dusty landscape as Highway Worker Ryder Jackson made his way to the latest crash site on Route 285. The worn asphalt stretched out before him like an endless snake, punctuated by lone mesquite trees and rusty old signs that seemed to be held together by nothing more than twine and sheer force of will.

Ryder, a rugged man in his mid-40s with a thick beard and weathered skin, adjusted the straps on his backpack, checking off items on a mental list: water, granola bars, first aid kit. He'd been working on this stretch of highway for months, watching as the desert sun beat down relentlessly on the worn asphalt, sending up clouds of dust and debris that seemed to have a life of their own.

As he reached the site, Ryder's eyes widened slightly at the sheer scale of the wreck - a battered old sedan lay twisted and mangled in the median, its tires shredded like rubberized confetti. The scent of gasoline and smoke hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of ozone that seemed to seep from every pore of the desert itself.

Ryder's phone beeped as he pulled out his radio, scanning the frequencies for updates on the incident. "All units, we have a 2-1-4 at mile marker 237...over." He took a deep breath, mentally preparing himself for the long night ahead - and whatever lay in store for him among the ruins of that crumpled old sedan.
