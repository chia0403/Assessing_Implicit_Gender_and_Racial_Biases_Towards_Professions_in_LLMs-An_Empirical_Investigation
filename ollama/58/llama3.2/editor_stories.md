Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of New York City were always at their most unforgiving in the early morning hours. The kind of grey, drizzly darkness that seemed to seep into every pore and make your bones ache with a dull fatigue. It was as if the city itself was exhaling its own version of exhaustion, a heavy sigh that echoed through the concrete canyons like a perpetual echo.

It was just such an hour when Emilia Sophia Rodriguez stumbled out of her small Upper East Side apartment, shaking the sleep from her hair and wrapping her arms around herself in a futile attempt to ward off the chill. She lived alone, a solitary creature after years of relationships that had ended as catastrophically as they began. The only constant in her life was her work, her role as an editor for a small publishing house in Manhattan.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Emilia couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy towards those who got to start their days with something more than just paperwork and deadlines. Her own world, one built on precision and attention to detail, was full of its own brand of beauty – but it was also suffocating in its own way.

With her eyes fixed on the pavement ahead, she began her trek through the rain-soaked streets, her thoughts already drifting towards the manuscript that lay waiting for her at the office. A promising new author's first novel, one that had all the makings of a classic – except for the pesky fact that it was, so far, completely unsellable.
