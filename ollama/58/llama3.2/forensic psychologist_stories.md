Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Maya Elizabeth Thompson stood at the edge of the storm-tossed harbor, the salty spray whipping her long, dark hair into a frenzy as she gazed out at the small town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea. The moon was new, casting an inky blackness over the rocky shores and weathered piers, where fishing boats rocked gently on the waves like skeletal giants.

It was a chilly autumn evening, the air crisp with the scent of seaweed and damp earth. The wind carried the faintest hint of smoke, a reminder that Ravenswood's residents were beginning to stir back to life after a long, grueling winter. Maya's eyes narrowed as she scanned the rooftops, her trained mind searching for any signs of trouble - or potential clients.

As a forensic psychologist with the FBI, Maya had seen her share of darkness and despair. But there was something about Ravenswood that drew her in, a sense of isolation and vulnerability that spoke to her own deep-seated anxieties. Maybe it was the way the town seemed to cling to the edge of the world, as if perched on the precipice of disaster.

Whatever the reason, Maya felt an inexplicable pull to this place, a sense that Ravenswood held secrets and mysteries waiting to be uncovered. And she was about to become entangled in its web of intrigue, no matter how deep it twisted.
