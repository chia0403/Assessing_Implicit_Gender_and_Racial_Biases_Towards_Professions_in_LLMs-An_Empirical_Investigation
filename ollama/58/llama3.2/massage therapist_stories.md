Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The warm sun had long since set over the bustling streets of downtown Portland, casting a golden glow over the city's eclectic mix of art galleries, vintage shops, and restaurants. Inside the tranquil oasis of Serenity Massage Therapy, nestled between a yoga studio and a health food store, Aurora "Rory" Wilder was preparing for another busy evening.

As a licensed massage therapist with a keen sense of intuition and a passion for helping others release physical tension, Rory had built a loyal client base among the city's wellness-conscious crowd. Her own body, however, told a different story – one of chronic pain and stiffness, a constant reminder that even with her own hands, she couldn't always heal herself.

Rory took a deep breath, letting the calming scent of essential oils wash over her as she began to set up for the evening's appointments. She had just finished a particularly grueling massage session with a client who was struggling with sciatica, and now it was time to switch gears and focus on the gentle, soothing work that brought her own body peace.

As she smoothed out the linens and adjusted the candles, Rory's gaze drifted out the window, where the twinkling lights of the Willamette River reflected off the dark glass of the city's skyscrapers. She felt a familiar sense of calm wash over her, as if the night's energies were already beginning to align in her favor.

Little did she know, however, that this quiet evening was about to take an unexpected turn – one that would force Rory to confront the mysteries of her own body and the secrets it had been keeping from her all along.
