Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the deserted checkout lanes of "Sunny Savings" grocery store on a drizzly Wednesday evening. Amidst the hum of humming refrigerators and the muffled chatter of late-night shoppers, 22-year-old Kaitlyn Mae Jenkins rang up groceries for a frazzled mom, juggling a fussy toddler and a overflowing shopping cart.

Kaitlyn's eyes scanned the screen as she processed the mother's purchases - discounted cans of soup, diapers, and a gallon of milk. She had worked at Sunny Savings since high school, and had grown accustomed to the monotony of her job, but tonight felt different. The store was closed to new customers, but the fluorescent lights still seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy.

As she finished scanning the final item - a pack of instant noodles - Kaitlyn's manager, Mrs. Patel, poked her head out from behind the customer service desk. "Kaitlyn, we're closing in 10 minutes," she said firmly, her voice dripping with an unspoken warning. "You know what that means."

Kaitlyn raised an eyebrow, wondering what Mrs. Patel had in mind this time. It wasn't the first time the store had announced a last-minute "early closure" on a Wednesday - and Kaitlyn had learned to be prepared for whatever lay ahead.

But as she locked up her register and began to count down the minutes until her shift ended, Kaitlyn couldn't shake the feeling that tonight was going to be different. Something was brewing beneath the surface of Sunny Savings, and Kaitlyn Mae Jenkins was about to find herself right at the center of it all.
