Here's a potential story opening:

The scent of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air as Aurora "Rory" Thompson carefully buffed the nails of her latest client at Bella Vita Nail Salon. The warm glow of the afternoon sun streaming through the large windows highlighted the vibrant colors and eclectic decor of the salon, making it feel like a slice of Italy in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. Rory, with her bright pink streaks in her jet-black hair and infectious laugh, had spent years honing her craft as a manicurist, and her clients adored her for her attention to detail and creative flair.

As she worked on the intricate designs on the client's nails, Rory couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness. She was supposed to be on her way home from work an hour ago, but something had kept her in the salon, chatting with her coworker and best friend, Maria, about their latest gossip and plans for the weekend. Now, as the sun began to set over the city, casting a golden glow over the bustling streets of LA, Rory felt a sudden pang of anxiety. She knew she was running late for her own appointment at home – she had promised her niece that they would spend the evening together, watching movies and making memories.

But what if something unexpected came up? What if someone needed her help in a way she couldn't ignore?

Rory's mind began to wander as she carefully applied a final coat of topcoat to the client's nails. She glanced at her watch, feeling a growing sense of unease. She was going to be late.

And then, just as she was about to bid farewell to her client and head out the door, Rory's phone rang. The ringing stopped, and a low, gravelly voice spoke on the other end: "Aurora Thompson?"

Rory's heart skipped a beat as she recognized the voice. She knew that tone all too well – it belonged to someone she hadn't heard from in years.

"Aurora," the voice said again, more slowly this time. "I need to see you."

Rory's mind went blank as she stared at her phone, wondering who could be calling her at this moment, and what they wanted with her.
