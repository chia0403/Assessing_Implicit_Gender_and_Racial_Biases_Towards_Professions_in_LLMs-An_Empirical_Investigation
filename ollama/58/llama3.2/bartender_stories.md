Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the bar reflected off the rain-soaked streets of downtown Ashwood, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted sidewalks. Inside, the sounds of clinking glasses and hushed conversations provided a warm respite from the chilly autumn evening.

Behind the polished wooden counter, Ember Rose Thompson poured another round for a lone patron, her eyes scanning the regulars with a practiced air of curiosity. At 25, Ember had spent the better part of five years honing her craft as a bartender, learning the intricacies of every cocktail and listening to the stories that came with them.

She was no stranger to Ashwood's rough-around-the-edges charm, having grown up on the outskirts of town where her single mother worked at the local diner. The bar was more than just a job for Ember – it was a refuge, a place where she could escape the whispers and warnings about her own complicated past.

As the door swung open once more, letting in a cold draft of night air, Ember's gaze met that of a stranger, his eyes scanning the room with an air of quiet intensity that made her instincts twitch. It was clear he wasn't here for just another round – or perhaps for anything at all.
