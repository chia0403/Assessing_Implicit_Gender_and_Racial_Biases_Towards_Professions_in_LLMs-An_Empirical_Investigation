He had been a bell hop at the Grand Plaza Hotel for five years, watching as the city's elite came and went, each leaving their mark on the place. The air was thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and last night's champagne, and Edgar's eyes felt heavy from the exhaustion that came with working the late shift.

As he stood in the deserted lobby, the only sound being the creaking of the old wooden elevator and the soft hum of the air conditioning unit, Edgar couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The phone had been ringing nonstop all night, each call coming in from a different number, with no one on the other end. It was as if someone was trying to leave messages, but for what purpose, Edgar had no idea.
