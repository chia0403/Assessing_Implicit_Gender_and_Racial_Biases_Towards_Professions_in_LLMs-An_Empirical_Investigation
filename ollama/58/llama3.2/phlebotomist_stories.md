Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a phlebotomist as the main character:

Opening:

As she steered her van down the long, deserted street, Phoebe Anne Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The early morning sun cast an eerie glow over the rows of houses, making the shadows seem to writhe and twist like living things. She had worked as a phlebotomist at this clinic for five years, but on days like this, she felt like she was just going through the motions.

Setting:

The town of Oakwood was small enough that everyone knew each other's names, but it was also isolated enough to make strangers feel like outsiders. Phoebe had grown up here, and after high school, she had left to attend college in a bigger city, determined to make a name for herself. But life had taken her on a different path, and now she found herself back in Oakwood, working at the local clinic.

The clinic itself was a modest building on the outskirts of town, with a faded sign that creaked in the gentle breeze. Phoebe pulled into the parking lot, next to the worn-out ambulance that sat in the corner, its lights still flashing from the previous day's emergency. As she killed the engine, she caught sight of her coworker, Rachel, waiting by the door, a look of concern etched on her face.

"Hey, Phoebe," Rachel said, as Phoebe stepped out of the van. "What's wrong? You looked like you'd seen a ghost when you pulled in."

Phoebe hesitated, unsure of how to explain the strange feeling that had been building inside her all morning. She had always prided herself on being able to handle anything that came her way, but today felt different. Today, she couldn't shake the sense that something was waiting for her around the next corner.

"What's going on?" Phoebe repeated, as Rachel led her into the clinic. "I just... I don't know. It feels like something is off."

Rachel nodded sympathetically. "Maybe it's just nerves," she suggested. "We've got a lot of patients lined up for today, and you must be feeling a little anxious about that."

Phoebe took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling. She had worked in phlebotomy long enough to know that nerves were normal, especially on busy days like this. But as she followed Rachel into the clinic, she couldn't help but wonder if there was more to it than that.

As they entered the clinic, Phoebe caught sight of a piece of paper on her desk, with her name scribbled in bold letters: "Phoebe A. Thompson, Urgent Appointment".
