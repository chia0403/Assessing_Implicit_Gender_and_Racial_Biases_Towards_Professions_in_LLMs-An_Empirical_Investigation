Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. Tourist groups were starting to filter in for the day's last visit, their footsteps echoing off the sandstone walls as they made their way towards the iconic Treasury building.

Amidst the throngs of visitors, one figure stood out - Azizah "Zee" Al-Khateeb, a seasoned tour guide with a sharp mind and a quick wit. Her dark hair was tied back in a neat ponytail, and her bright brown eyes sparkled with excitement as she greeted each new group with a warm smile.

Born and raised in Petra, Zee had grown up exploring the ancient ruins and learning its secrets from her father, a respected guide in his own right. She had taken over his tours years ago, earning a reputation for her extensive knowledge and passion for sharing the city's rich history with visitors from all corners of the world.

As she waited for the next group to arrive, Zee couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and ownership over her beloved city. Petra was more than just a tourist destination - it was a piece of her own heritage, a reminder of the ancient civilizations that had come before and shaped the course of human history. And as she prepared to lead another group through its winding streets and temples, Zee felt a thrill of anticipation. What secrets would this day reveal?
