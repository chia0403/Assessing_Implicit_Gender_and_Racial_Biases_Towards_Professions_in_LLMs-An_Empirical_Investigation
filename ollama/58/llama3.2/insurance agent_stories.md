Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Portland, Oregon glistened like polished onyx as Agent Emily J. Wellington stepped out of her office building, a haze of cigarette smoke lingering in the air behind her. She lit another cigarette, feeling the familiar comfort of nicotine as she surveyed the drizzly afternoon. The city was always at its most melancholy on days like this - the kind of day that made you want to curl up with a good book and a warm cup of coffee.

Emily, a 35-year-old insurance agent with a sharp mind and a quick wit, stood on the corner of Main and Elm, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalk as she waited for the light to change. Her black hair was tied back in a tight ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks that seemed to darken in intensity when she was stressed - which was often.

As an insurance agent, Emily had seen it all - from catastrophic accidents to egregious errors on behalf of her clients. She took pride in being the best advocate for those who needed protection, but sometimes the job left her feeling like she was just patching holes in a leaky roof, never quite getting ahead of the water.

The phone in her pocket buzzed with an incoming call from an unknown number, and Emily's instincts kicked in. She hesitated for a moment before answering, her voice firm as she asked "Hello?" - unaware that this chance call would set off a chain reaction of events that would change her life forever.
