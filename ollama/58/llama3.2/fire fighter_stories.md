Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this. The storm had rolled in just as the sun was setting over the small town, casting a dark and foreboding shadow over the already deserted streets. For Emily Anne "Emmie" Thompson, a 25-year-old firefighter with the Ravenswood Fire Department, it was just another typical Tuesday evening.

The department's station house on 5th Street was quiet, except for the steady hum of the fluorescent lights overhead and the occasional beep of the alarm system. Emmie sat at her desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee, as she reviewed the day's reports on her laptop screen. It had been a slow night so far, with only a few minor calls to answer - a reported leak in the old movie theater on Main Street, and a power outage at the local diner.

As she scrolled through the emails on her computer, one message caught her eye - a notification from dispatch that a call was coming in. "All units, we have a possible 3-alarm fire at the old mill on Elm Street," it read. Emmie's eyes narrowed as she quickly grabbed her phone to make sure she had all the details. The old mill had been abandoned for years, and rumors of squatters and illicit activity had long made it a no-go zone.

Without hesitation, Emmie typed out a quick response - "Ravenwood 1, en route" - and stood up from her chair, ready to head out into the stormy night.
