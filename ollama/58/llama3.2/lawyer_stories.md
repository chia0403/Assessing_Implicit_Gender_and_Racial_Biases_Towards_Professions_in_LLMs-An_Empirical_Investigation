Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in New York City, casting a grey veil over the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan. The lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement like a kaleidoscope of diamonds, but for Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, the beauty of the night was lost amidst the hustle and bustle of her busy life.

As a partner at the prestigious law firm of Hastings & Associates, Lexi had spent the last decade navigating the cutthroat world of corporate law, earning a reputation as one of the most tenacious and intelligent lawyers in the city. Her sharp mind and quick wit had won over even the toughest opponents, but at what cost? The endless hours spent pouring over contracts and negotiating deals had taken its toll on her personal life, leaving Lexi feeling more like a tool than a human being.

Lexi stood outside her office building, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee as she gazed out at the city. She was supposed to be heading home for the evening, but something about tonight felt different. Maybe it was the sense of restlessness that had been growing inside her all week, or maybe it was the nagging feeling that there was more to life than just winning cases and collecting a paycheck.

Whatever the reason, Lexi knew she needed a change. She took a deep breath, feeling the cool night air fill her lungs, and made a decision. Tonight, she would leave the world of law behind and take a chance on herself. Little did she know, that chance would lead her down a path that would challenge everything she thought she knew about herself and her place in the world.

As Lexi turned to head into the office building, her phone buzzed with an incoming text from an unknown number: "Meet me at Joe's Tavern at midnight. Come alone."
