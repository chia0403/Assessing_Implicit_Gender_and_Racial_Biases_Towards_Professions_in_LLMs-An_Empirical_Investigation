Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As a draftsman at the esteemed architectural firm of Wheeler & Co., Cassius was no stranger to long hours and drizzly days, but tonight's excursion felt particularly bleak.

Cassius's eyes squinted against the sodium glow of streetlights as he made his way through the deserted streets, the sounds of the city muffled by the patter of raindrops on his umbrella. He had just finished a grueling shift at the office, pouring over lines and curves for the upcoming expansion of the historic City Hall building.

Cassius shivered, despite his thick jacket, and quickened his pace, eager to shed the drabness of the day and lose himself in the stacks of papers and blueprints waiting for him on his desk.
