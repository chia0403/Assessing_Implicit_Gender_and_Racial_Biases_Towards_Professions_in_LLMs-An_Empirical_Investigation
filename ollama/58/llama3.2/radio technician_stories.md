Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a small workshop nestled between the local hardware store and the town's only diner, radio technician Emilia Mae Jenkins was hunched over her workbench, tinkering with a vintage AM transmitter.

The message had been garbled and unclear, but something about it had set her nerves on edge. Now, as she carefully soldered a patch onto the transmitter's circuit board, Mia couldn't shake the feeling that this event was more than just a minor technical glitch...
