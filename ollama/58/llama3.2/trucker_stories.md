Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just begun to set over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, casting a warm orange glow over the desolate stretch of highway that Jack "Hawk" Hawkins had been driving for hours. As he pulled his trusty Peterbilt 359 into the parking lot of the next truck stop, Hawk let out a deep sigh and rubbed the fatigue from his eyes. He'd been on the road since dawn, hauling a load of electronics from Los Angeles to Dallas, and all he wanted was a good night's sleep.

Hawk had been a trucker for over a decade, and he knew every highway, rest stop, and diner in the country like the back of his hand. But after a string of close calls and near-misses on the road, he'd started to feel like he was losing himself in the process of living someone else's life.

As he shut off the engine and climbed out of the cab, Hawk gazed up at the stars beginning to twinkle overhead, feeling the weight of his responsibilities as a driver and a provider. His mind kept wandering back to his wife, Sarah, who was waiting for him back home in Texas, and their two kids, who were counting on their daddy to bring them dinner money.

Hawk took one last look around the parking lot, making sure everything was secure before heading inside to grab some grub and refuel. Little did he know, this would be the start of a journey that would take him off the beaten path and into the heart of darkness...
