Rain lashed against the office windows, mimicking the chaotic drumming of Elara’s own heartbeat as she gazed at the door to the inner sanctum.  Her patients had been a blur of anxious faces and mumbled apologies for a half-hour, each one more stressful than the last. The scent of bleach clung to the air, heavy and unmoving like the fog rolling in from the Pacific Ocean beyond. Elara, known as "Ellie" by her coworkers, was about to leave her usual post on the dental chair when a frantic voice called from the hallway. 

“Elara! It’s...it’s him!” The voice of Ms. Henderson, her elderly patient and one of Elara's most frequent customers, trembled as she squeezed Ellie's shoulder, the familiar weight of her rosary beads pressing against Ellie’s palm. "He's here,” Ms. Henderson whispered. 

"What are you talking about?" 
Ellie stepped into the hallway, rain drumming a steady rhythm against the glass, blurring the already-grey light flooding from the streetlamps outside. The air was thick with anxiety and an unspoken tension. Elara took a deep breath as she looked at Ms. Henderson's pale face, her eyes wide with fear. 

**Setting:** A modest dental practice nestled in the heart of a bustling seaside town on the West Coast.  The weather is perpetually damp and foggy. The setting evokes a feeling of cozy predictability, yet there's a undercurrent of unease that permeates the atmosphere due to the storm raging outside.


**Main character:** Ellie "Elara" Jensen, a seasoned dental hygienist.
