The air hung heavy with the scent of old stone and sawdust as Elias Thorne stared out at the skeletal remains of the abandoned cathedral.  He knew it was foolish to linger so close to this place after sundown, yet here he was, hours later than expected. It wasn't the city’s shadows that bothered him; they were merely a familiar cloak upon the bones of this once-grand structure. No, it was the silence. A suffocating, oppressive silence punctuated by the rhythmic drip-drip of water from unseen leaks and the mournful sigh of wind through broken gargoyles. 

Elias Thorne wasn't just an architect, he was a dreamer who found solace in the crumbling remnants of forgotten stories.  He saw potential in every discarded piece, each jagged shard reflecting his own fractured past. It was this very past that had brought him here, to this derelict cathedral in the heart of the decaying city of Veridia. He needed answers, and only these echoes of history might hold them. 

Elias’s fingers idly brushed against the cracked stonework, the cold surface a stark reminder of his own mortality. This wasn't just about finding blueprints; he was searching for something more, for an elusive thread that would unravel the knot of his grief and guide him towards a future worthy of the man he once thought he could be.
