The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and cheap cigarettes in the tiny apartment building's communal hallway.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows like angry fists, mirroring the turmoil swirling inside Daniel Thorne's gut. His breath fogged up his mug as he stared at the chipped ceramic bowl he was supposed to be distributing free toiletries from. On the form beside him, "Mr. Jeremiah Blackwood" in a childish scrawl, seemed mockingly innocent.

Daniel Thorne had been a probation officer for six years now, and watching young men like Jeremiah stumble through life’s jagged edges was a constant source of frustration.  His job wasn't about judging; it was about helping – guiding them out of the abyss they were so often falling into, offering them small, concrete steps to climb the mountain towards something resembling stability. He wasn't naive enough to think he could change them all, but Jeremiah…Jeremiah seemed a particularly difficult case, one that felt heavier than usual tonight, like a stone in his stomach. 

The flickering light of the old ceiling fixture cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor, highlighting the cracked paint and chipped tiles with a disturbingly sinister beauty. This was another facet of the city’s soul he'd been trying to understand for years –  the ugliness woven into the very fabric of their existence.  The kind that couldn't be erased by a few free toiletries or a warm meal at the local soup kitchen.
