## The Burning Bridge

The air hung thick with the scent of burnt wood and something else – a sharp, metallic tang that pricked at Amelia’s nostrils. She adjusted her worn scarf around her neck, pulling it tighter as she gazed down at the charred remains of the old bridge. Towering above her, skeletal steel structures stood like ghosts against the bruised sky. The once-proud archway, the city’s lifeline, was reduced to rubble and ash, a silent testament to the chaos that had engulfed their lives just hours ago. 

Amelia's name echoed around the devastation.  She wasn’t exactly famous - at least not until this night. She’d been called "the voice of the forgotten" for her relentless pursuit of truth in the face of apathy and corruption. Tonight, she was a warrior, armed with a battered notebook and her unwavering gaze. The city lights, flickering and pale, mocked her as she started to write, “The Bridge Burning,” in large, bold letters on a piece of charred wood salvaged from the rubble.
