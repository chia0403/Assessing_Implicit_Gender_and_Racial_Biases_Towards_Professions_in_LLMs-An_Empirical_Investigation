The air hung thick and heavy in The Drunken Cleaver, an aroma of aging leather and pine needles mingling with the sweet tang of blood and salt.  Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Hemlock worked the bone-ridged meat cleaver with practiced ease, its steel singing against the butcher block as he carved a succulent pork tenderloin. A symphony of chopping, slicing, and grates clinking filled the dim space, punctuated by the rhythmic thudding of Barty's heart - almost as if to keep pace with the relentless hammering of his work.

Barty was the epitome of quiet diligence in a bustling city that ran on chaos. He wore the worn leather apron and grease-stained cap like a badge of honor, a silent observer to the whirlwind he helped maintain. The Drunken Cleaver was more than just a meat shop; it was Barty's lifeblood, his sanctuary from the ever-present clamor of the city outside his little corner of butcher bliss. 

Outside, pigeons cooed their discontent in the rain that trickled down the crooked windowpane, and the streetlights cast an anemic glow on the bustling alleyway. Even in this familiar world of meat and wood and the quiet hum of a well-oiled business, there was a feeling of anticipation brewing. Something significant had been ordered last night, something Barty hadn't quite understood until he found it laid out upon the butcher block: a single, pristine white boar carcass with an intricately carved wooden label that read simply "The Prince".
