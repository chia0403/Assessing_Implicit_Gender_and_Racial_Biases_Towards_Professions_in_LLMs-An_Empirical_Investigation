Rain lashed against the windows of Station 43, blurring the neon glow of the city outside into streaks of purple and emerald. Inside, Daniel "Danny" Hayes, a hulking man with hands rough as bark and eyes that shone like smoldering embers, sat slumped over his coffee mug. The smell of old engine grease mingled with the bitter taste of burnt sugar in his mouth, an odd combination he'd come to accept as part of life on the frontlines.  He was staring out at the rain-slick streets below, watching the relentless stream of cars weave their way through the deluge. Tonight, though, a different kind of storm brewed inside him. It wasn't a weather pattern; it was something more volatile, something he couldn't quite put his finger on. A knot in his stomach, tight and constricted, mirrored the churning anxiety within him.  He closed his eyes, trying to remember why he even bothered with these endless nights. The thought of facing another life-or-death situation, another fight against unseen adversaries, was both terrifyingly alluring and agonizingly inevitable. 

**Setting:**  A busy fire station in a bustling metropolis like Chicago.
