The air in the waiting room was thick with anxiety, each patient's tension echoing off the white walls like whispers in a storm.  Even after years as a phlebotomist at Mercy West Hospital, Fiona "Finn" O'Connell still found it unnerving. Today’s caseload was particularly heavy: five patients waiting for their blood tests, all facing different anxieties from routine screenings to worrying pre-cancer checkups. 

Finn, with her neat bun and floral blouse, blended into the sterile atmosphere like a calm wave in a churning sea. She navigated through the chairs, her practiced movements as smooth and efficient as a dancer’s steps.  But today was different. A persistent unease thrummed beneath her skin; it emanated from the new doctor on the staff, Dr. Marcus Hayes. Finn had never seen anyone so unnervingly calm in the face of chaos, his demeanor serene even when he greeted patients with an unsettling smile that seemed to linger just a moment too long. 

She approached Mrs. Henderson, her usual calming presence tinged with curiosity. The woman’s frail hand clutched a worn handbag as she shifted uncomfortably. "Good morning, Mrs. Henderson," Finn said, gently taking the needle holder and offering a small smile.  "Ready for your bloodwork?"
