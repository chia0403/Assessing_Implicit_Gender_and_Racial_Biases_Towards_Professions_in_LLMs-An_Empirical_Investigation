## Story Opening

Rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, each drop echoing like tiny hammers on the skull of her already frayed nerves. The scent of lavender and vanilla incense wafted through the air, attempting to soothe the storm brewing inside her. It was 7:32 PM, and she should be clocking out for the night. But instead, she sat hunched over a crumpled file, her once-confident posture now resembling a wilting plant in a greenhouse. 

Evelyn Thorne, Ph.D., felt as if her carefully crafted world of therapy sessions and professional detachment had been irrevocably cracked.  Her heart ached with the silent plea of her patient, Mrs. Alvarez, whose story she'd just finished meticulously documenting. A widow battling grief for her husband who died in an accident, Mrs. Alvarez was struggling to find hope amidst the crushing weight of loss. Her words, etched into a thick layer of despair on the page before Evelyn, held a raw and unfiltered ache that Evelyn knew too well. This wasn't just another case; it was a mirror reflecting her own buried grief, the one she had spent years suppressing beneath the veneer of expertise and compassion.

**Setting:** A small, cozy office in a quiet suburban area with a quaint, vintage decor reminiscent of an old library.  Evelynâ€™s walls are lined with bookshelves crammed with volumes on various psychological theories, with a large, comfortable armchair taking centre stage. The room exudes the calm ambiance of someone who has dedicated their life to understanding human emotions and offering solace. Yet, tonight, Evelyn's mind was anything but calm.
