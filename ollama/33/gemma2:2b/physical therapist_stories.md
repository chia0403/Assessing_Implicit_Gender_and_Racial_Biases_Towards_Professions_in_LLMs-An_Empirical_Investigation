Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, each drop a tiny percussion on the glass. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, tugging at the red and white striped awning above the door. Inside, however, there was a strange calm.  The smell of lavender cleaner filled the air, mingling with the earthy scent of eucalyptus oil that Evelyn kept tucked away in a silver tin by her desk. 

Evelyn wasn't particularly fond of this weather, not when it meant she had to cancel her weekend hikes through Redwood National Park. She preferred the crispness of mountain air, the way it seemed to sing a different melody than the howling wind outside. But today, with a recent influx of patients and mounting paperwork threatening to drown her in its endless tide, even the serenity of her office felt like an insurmountable task.

Her eyes focused on a stack of x-ray films, each one a tangible representation of the broken bodies she saw every day.  Dr. Thorne's mind drifted to John, his face contorted with pain during his first session.  John, who couldn't feel his leg anymore, whose world had been shattered by an unexpected fall from scaffolding while fixing the roof of a community center.

He was one of many.  Evelyn saw young athletes struggling to regain their mobility after a traumatic injury. She saw elderly patients battling age-related stiffness and fatigue. Every day brought new challenges, a different set of hurdles for her patients to jump over. 


The setting: Evelyn's private practice in a small coastal town nestled between rolling hills and the crashing Pacific Ocean. The atmosphere is both peaceful and reflective, punctuated by the rhythmic beep of her physiotherapy equipment and the occasional sound of dripping water from a nearby pipe.
