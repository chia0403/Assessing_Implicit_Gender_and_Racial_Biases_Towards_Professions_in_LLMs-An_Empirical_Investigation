Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Felix Blackwood's truck like an angry band of percussionists. He hunched further into his worn leather jacket as he pulled onto the gravel driveway leading up to Willow Creek Manor, the notorious estate that had been in constant whispers for years: a place where secrets festered like overgrown ivy and money couldn’t buy tranquility.  He was known by everyone as “Felix the Fixer,” able to coax life from even the most barren patch of earth and charm his way into the hearts of grumpy homeowners.

This time, however, Felix wasn't just dealing with the usual: a neglected rose bush here, a cracked patio there. This estate was haunted. Not by ghosts in the traditional sense, but by a darkness thicker than the thick fog rolling across the valley.  There was a palpable tension that clung to the air like clinging ivy on an ancient stone wall, and even Felix's usual cheerful optimism felt strained. 

This place needed more than just a new shed or a trim for the hedges; it needed a soul transfusion, something he wasn't entirely sure he had the skill to provide.  As he approached the imposing gothic manor with its overgrown ivy-choked façade, he couldn't help but feel like he was stepping onto a stage where his presence would be scrutinized and judged.
