The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke as Elias Thorne meticulously trimmed the overgrown hedges bordering Thornhill Manor.  His hands, calloused and strong from years spent tending to this sprawling estate, moved gracefully, each snip precise, each line perfectly drawn. He wasn't just a groundskeeper; he was the custodian of history, the silent protector of its secrets buried beneath layers of ivy and gnarled branches. The sun, a fiery ball sinking behind the distant pines, cast long shadows that stretched across the manicured lawns like forgotten memories. 

Thornhill Manor, with its stately fa√ßade and ancient stone arches, had seen better days. It whispered stories of bygone grandeur, each creaking floorboard a testament to years of laughter and loss, of love and heartbreak etched into the very walls. Elias lived in a small cottage at the edge of the estate, his only solace being the company of nature's silent chorus. But tonight, something was different. A creeping unease hummed beneath the surface of the quiet evening, a feeling that Elias couldn't quite place, and he found himself staring into the overgrown rose garden with an unnerving intensity.
