The rhythmic rasp of a plane cutting through wood was Elias Thorne’s lullaby. He'd lived and breathed woodworking since his grandfather gifted him his first small plane on his eleventh birthday.  Now, almost thirty years old, he ran his own workshop in the heart of the sprawling mountain village of Oakhaven, his workshop smelling like sawdust and aged timber, a comfortingly familiar aroma amidst the quiet hum of machinery.

The year was 1895, and the world beyond Oakhaven seemed to be caught in a perpetual summer haze, one that never quite settled on the valley floor. The air felt thick and heavy with possibility, just waiting for an ember of change to ignite it. Elias looked out his workshop window, the setting sun casting long shadows over the quaint cobblestone streets. 

His eyes drifted towards Mrs. Peterson's bakery across the way - a building that defied its humble facade; inside, a symphony of cinnamon and sugar danced with the clattering trays. He imagined her freshly baked pies, their golden crusts promising warmth and comfort like his own craftsmanship did for those who frequented his workshop.  

And as Elias started on the intricate design of a custom-made cabinet for Mrs. Peterson's granddaughter, he knew this summer wouldn’t be just another one of countless days spent beneath the mountain sky. This year was different, full of promise, anticipation, and the quiet hum of change waiting to be unleashed.
