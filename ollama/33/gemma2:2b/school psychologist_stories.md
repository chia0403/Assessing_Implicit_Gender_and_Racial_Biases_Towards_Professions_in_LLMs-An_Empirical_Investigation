## Story Opening: 

**Setting:** A run-down elementary school in a forgotten corner of Chicago. The building creaked with every gust of wind, its peeling paint flaking off like dead leaves. Inside, Mrs. Amelia Davenport, known affectionately as "Amy" to the kids she worked with, sat perched on a wobbly chair in her office – an oversized cubicle crammed full of therapy toys and stacks of files.

**Opening:**  The fluorescent lights hummed above Amy's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the room. She rubbed her eyes, yawning, as she flipped through yet another stack of parent-teacher conference notes. Each entry was an echo chamber of whispered anxieties and accusations: "My son's grades are plummeting," "My daughter refuses to leave the bathroom," "He swears he saw a ghost in the playground." Amy sighed, her smile fading with each new note. She longed for a day where she could help kids thrive, not just survive this chaos she found herself navigating. But as she glanced at a stack of brightly colored therapy kits, a small wave of hope crashed over her –  perhaps today, she might actually make a difference.
