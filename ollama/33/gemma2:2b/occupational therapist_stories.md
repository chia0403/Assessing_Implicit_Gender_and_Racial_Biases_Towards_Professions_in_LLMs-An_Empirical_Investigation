The salty air whipped Evelyn's auburn hair around her face as she stood on the sand-dusted pier, watching the vast expanse of the ocean unfold before her. It was August in Cape Cod, where the wind held secrets of the sea and whispered tales of forgotten fishermen. Even the gulls seemed to understand something deeper than just the rhythm of their cries; they soared with a quiet wisdom, their white feathers mirroring the clouds' ever-shifting moods above. 

Evelyn, or Evie as her patients affectionately called her, was a therapist who understood those whispers, even if she couldn't quite decipher them all. Her work focused on helping individuals reconnect with their bodies and minds after they had been ravaged by trauma or physical limitations. Today, she was meeting Mrs. Hawthorne, a stoic widow whose fingers, once nimble enough to weave intricate tapestries, now clung tightly to the worn wooden cane that aided her walk. The ocean's vastness mirrored Evelyn's own sense of helplessness - the sea could crush you beneath its waves or offer solace in its silent depths.  But this evening, Evelyn hoped to see a glimmer of hope emerge from Mrs. Hawthorneâ€™s closed eyes. 


The story will continue to unfold as we explore Evie's world and delve into Mrs. Hawthorne's past, the challenges she faces, and the secrets that lie beneath the surface of their lives.
