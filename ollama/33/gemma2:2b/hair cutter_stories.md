**Setting:**  A ramshackle barber shop nestled in the heart of Chinatown, New York City. Rain pattered against the stained windows, each drop like a tiny percussionist on the old tin roof. Steam curled from the kettle simmering atop the gas burner, its scent mingling with the heady aroma of lavender and rosemary oil emanating from the shelves filled with vintage styling tools.

His shop, “Reyes' Razor," had been in his family for generations, its faded paint and worn wooden chairs whispering tales of countless haircuts and whispered secrets.

Her lips were pursed in a tight line, worry etched into the lines between them, and she clutched a worn leather bag like it held some fragile treasure. "Eli," she called, her voice barely audible over the incessant drumming of the rain. "You’re my last hope."
