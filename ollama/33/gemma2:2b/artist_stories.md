Rain hammered against the attic windowpane, each drop a tiny drumbeat on the old glass.  Inside, Amelia “Amy” Thorne hunched over her easel, paint-splattered apron stretched taut across her waist like a worn canvas. The air hung heavy with the smell of turpentine and damp wood as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn shade of blue. It refused to blend harmoniously with the vibrant emerald green dominating the still life before her - a bouquet of anemones, their petals delicately ruffled by an unseen breeze. 

The setting was stark: a single bulb hanging precariously from a crooked wire in the attic's centre cast harsh light on dust motes dancing like miniature fireflies.  Amy’s studio, inherited from her grandmother, was a space where time seemed to stand still. The world beyond its cobwebbed door faded into whispers of forgotten summers and creaking floorboards.  As she continued her work, the silence punctuated only by the frantic rhythm of her brushstrokes, Amy found herself contemplating the ephemeral nature of beauty - and the fleeting moments that left their mark on time itself.
