The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the vast Saskatchewan sky in hues of burnt orange and violet as Silas Blackwood began his evening chores. His weathered hands clasped around a worn leather pouch containing a handful of dried herbs, each one carefully chosen for its medicinal properties by generations before him. A lifetime of tending to the land had ingrained in Silas not only respect but also fear for the earth's bounty; his grandfather's stories echoed in his ears - tales of drought-stricken seasons and pestilence that plagued their crops. He adjusted the bandana around his neck, a stark contrast to the fading light as he looked out over his sprawling farm, a small island of green against the encroaching darkness. 

Silas Blackwood’s life was a quiet rhythm: rise with the sun, tend his land, harvest the bounty and pray for rain. The year was 1925, a time when whispers about the Great War had begun to stir, yet Silas found comfort in his small world of crops, livestock, and the endless sky that held his dreams. But this night, something felt off. A chill wind whipped through the fields, carrying with it an unfamiliar scent – metallic and sharp, like burnt iron. The usual symphony of crickets and frogs was absent, replaced by a strange silence punctuated only by the mournful cry of a lone hawk circling overhead.
