The neon glow of the city bled into the dark canvas of the night sky, painting streaks of colour across Amelia "Amy" Reyes's tiny apartment window.  Her keyboard glowed like an ethereal eye in the pre-dawn darkness, casting its own peculiar light on the wall plastered with her favourite coding projects – intricate algorithms designed to break down the complex language of human expression into quantifiable data points. 

It was a Wednesday, and Amy was staring at the screen for the tenth time, fingers tapping rhythmically against the keys. Her current project was particularly daunting:  creating an algorithm that could analyse social media posts to predict future market trends based on collective sentiment. It was supposed to be a groundbreaking feat, but it felt more like a mountain she was struggling to climb. The weight of expectation and the pressure from investors – all eyes were on her – felt crushing. She wasn't just coding; Amy was crafting the future, and tonight, the future felt anything but bright. 

The rhythmic hum of the city outside began to stir something inside her, a spark of defiance against the encroaching deadline and the growing sense of failure.  She took a deep breath, remembering her father's words: "Amy, even the most complicated code can be broken down into something simple. It all boils down to logic.” 

Suddenly, an idea popped into her mind like a bolt of lightning.  She couldn’t afford to dwell on the past; she needed to find a solution, and fast. With newfound vigour, Amy switched off the computer screen, the glow fading from its metallic surface, leaving behind only the faint shimmer of hope that danced in the silence.
