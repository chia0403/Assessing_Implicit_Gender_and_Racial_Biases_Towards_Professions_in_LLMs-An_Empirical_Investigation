## The Shadow of Dusk 

The city hummed with an oppressive twilight as if the sun itself was holding its breath before surrender.  A chill wind whispered through the cobblestone streets of Aloria City, rattling the banners and sending shivers down even the thickest cloak.  Elias Thorne, his jaw set under a wide-brimmed hat that shadowed his eyes, surveyed his post at the entrance to the Royal Palace. 

"Anything, Elias?" barked Lieutenant Abernathy from across the courtyard. His gruff voice sliced through the silence like a cold steel blade. "The Prince is expecting you." 

Elias straightened, pulling his cloak tighter around himself. The night was thick with secrets, and even under the pale light of the waning moon, he could feel the weight of them pressing down upon him.  He was known as the Shadow Guard, the silent sentinel who patrolled the Palace's perimeter for any threat - real or imagined. But tonight, a distinct unease gnawed at his gut. The air thrummed with a strange energy, a feeling he couldn't quite grasp. It felt...like anticipation. 

Elias glanced towards the towering stone gates of the Royal Palace.  Their intricate carvings depicted scenes of past kings and queens - a history that echoed within his own soul as much as it did in Aloria itself. He was tasked with protecting the lineage, the legacy, but tonight, the line between protector and prisoner seemed blurred.
