Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the diner, creating a rhythmic counterpoint to the low drone of its lone radio playing blues music. The air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions and burnt coffee as 32-year-old Amelia "Amy" Carter hunched over her battered notebook at a corner table, her brow furrowed in concentration.  Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, tugging at the faded turquoise awning above the diner door. Her gaze darted between the rain-streaked window and the flickering neon sign that announced 'Wally's Diner' in faded red letters. 

Amy had spent the past two hours trying to understand this story. The details were elusive, shrouded in whispers and half-truths. The locals called it "The Incident" - a strange, unexplained event that had rocked the small town of Oakhaven.  There was no official report, just frantic calls from concerned neighbors, their voices rising in a chorus of fear and unease. 

A man with a worn fedora pulled low over his brow entered Wally's. He stepped towards Amy, looking every inch the weary traveler, his eyes as blue as a summer sky and shadowed by years lived too quickly.  He wore a canvas bag slung over his shoulder that seemed to hum with a faint thrumming energy. 

"You know why I'm here, don't you?" he rasped in a voice like gravel sliding across wet pavement.


**Setting:** A small-town diner named "Wally's" in the fictional town of Oakhaven, where time seems to have taken a long detour into routine and quiet despair.
