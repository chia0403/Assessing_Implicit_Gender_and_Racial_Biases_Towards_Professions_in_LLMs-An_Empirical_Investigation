The flickering neon sign of the "Serenity Cafe" cast an unsettling purple glow across Dr. Evelyn Hayes's weary face as she leaned against the brick wall, watching rain splatter down on the cracked asphalt. Her mahogany-handled briefcase felt heavier than usual in her hand, each step towards the cafe door a painful reminder of her latest appointment.  The "Serenity Cafe" was an ironic name for a place that seemed to exude anything but calm; its walls were plastered with faded motivational quotes that whispered unspoken anxieties about life's burdens, and the aroma of stale coffee hung like a shroud around Evelyn.

Evelyn wasn't sure if it was the rain or the setting itself, but this town had become her personal challenge. Every new case felt as though she was wrestling with unseen demons - not just in her patients' minds, but within herself too.  Her colleagues joked that she'd grown a permanent "troubled-eyed" look since moving here for what she thought would be a fresh start. Now, faced with the endless stream of anxiety, depression, and trauma that poured out of every patient she saw, Evelyn began to wonder if “fresh” was even possible anymore.
