## Story Opening

**Setting:** A swanky penthouse apartment overlooking a glittering Chicago skyline, its windows reflecting the neon buzz of the city below. The scent of citrus-infused air freshener hangs heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the rain pounding against the skyscraper glass just outside. 

**Main character:**  Eleanor "Ellie" Davenport, a seasoned insurance agent known for her razor-sharp wit and uncanny ability to navigate the treacherous waters of high-stakes financial deals. Today, however, Ellie feels adrift. Even as she sips her chamomile tea, an unsettling sense of unease pervades the room. 

**Opening lines:** 
"Another life in tatters," Ellie muttered, swirling the chamomile tea around her cup. A lifetime spent navigating the high-roller's den of financial dealings had taught her one thing: there were few things as tragic as watching a fortune fall apart like yesterday's news.  This case was particularly poignant. It wasnâ€™t just about the loss of millions; it was about the shattered life of a man she barely knew, a man whose story, like his fortunes, was now nothing but a broken promise.

"Tell me," she whispered to the empty space beside her. "What's gone wrong?"
