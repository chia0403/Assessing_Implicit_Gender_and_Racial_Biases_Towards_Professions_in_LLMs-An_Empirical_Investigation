The sun beat down on the rough-hewn granite like a hammer blow.  Dust motes danced in the hazy air, reflecting off its surface with an iridescent shimmer. This was the life of Alastor "Stone" Thorne,  his hands calloused and strong from years spent carving out beauty from raw earth. His workshop, nestled deep within the belly of the mountain, was a testament to his craft: walls thick with carved patterns that flowed like water, floors rough-hewn but smooth beneath his worn boots.  Alastor's mind, however, remained in another realm â€“ a land filled with whispering winds and ancient stories etched into every stone he touched. He could hear the echo of forgotten battles in the granite, feel the ghosts of empires buried deep within its veins. 

Today, though, Stone felt an unsettling quiet that was unlike anything he'd ever known.  His usual rhythmic carving was swallowed by a silence so profound it pressed against his chest like a stone wall.  He knew there would be something to carve. He always knew. But today, the source of inspiration remained elusive.
