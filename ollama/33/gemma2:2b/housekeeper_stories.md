The air in Blackwood Manor hung thick with dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams that sliced through the stained-glass windows. Amelia Thorne ran her gloved hand along the mahogany banister, its surface cool beneath her fingertips. She inhaled deeply, the familiar scent of mothballs and ancient secrets mingling with the sharp tang of citrus from a lemon pie left on the kitchen table â€“ an unwelcome aroma she usually found offensive but somehow comforting in this house of faded grandeur. 

Amelia Thorne wasn't always just 'the housekeeper.'  Once, her life had been a tapestry woven with vibrant colors: a childhood spent climbing tree branches in the wilds of Scotland, dancing barefoot under the summer moon, and dreams as boundless as the sky itself. Now, trapped behind the peeling wallpaper and creaking floorboards of Blackwood Manor, she felt like a threadbare remnant of a faded dream.
