Sunlight struggled to pierce through the thick canopy overhead, casting the familiar landscape in shades of gray and green. Inside the cozy wooden hut on the edge of the forest, Elsie "El" Blackwood, her hands calloused and smelling faintly of woodsmoke and animal fur, brewed a pot of steaming tea.  Her worn spectacles perched precariously atop her nose as she skimmed through the daily newspaper, its headline proclaiming the recent discovery of a rare blackbird in the heart of the Redwood National Park. 

El was a creature of habit; each day began with tending to the small menagerie that resided within her humble abode: Gus, the grumpy old badger; Tilly, the playful otter pup; and, most importantly, Finn, the lone wolf cub she’d rescued from a harsh winter months ago.  The wildness of the woods resonated in El's veins, a constant hum beneath the surface of her quiet life. But today, something was different. A restlessness lingered in her chest, fueled by a sense of anticipation and unease. The blackbird incident had ignited a spark within her – a yearning for adventure, an echo of the wild that seemed to beckon beyond the familiar woods.
