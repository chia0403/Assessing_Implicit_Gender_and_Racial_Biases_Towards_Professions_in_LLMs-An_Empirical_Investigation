Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of "Rusty's Wrench," each drop a tiny hammer striking the old storefront windows. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of motor oil and sweat, a familiar mix that both comforted and unsettled Ezekiel “Zee” Jones.  He wiped greasy hands on his worn denim apron, gazing out at the deluge outside. It was a Tuesday like any other - except for the fact that Zee’s newest project sat in the corner, its rusty body gleaming under the harsh light of the shop's only fluorescent bulb. A 1967 Mustang GT – a beauty with a soul as faded as the chrome on its hood, but with promises of roaring life waiting to be unleashed.

Zee was no stranger to fixing broken things. For fifteen years, he’d poured his heart into repairing cars for folks in this sleepy town, from rusted jalopies to gleaming Ferraris.  But this Mustang? This was different. It wasn't just another project; it held the memories of his grandfather, a man whose love for speed and mechanics had shaped Zee's own life. Now, with the storm raging outside, Zee felt the weight of history pressing down on him. 

He took a deep breath, ran his calloused fingers over the Mustang’s hood, and vowed to breathe new life into this vintage legend. But first, he needed to face the storm, both inside and out.
