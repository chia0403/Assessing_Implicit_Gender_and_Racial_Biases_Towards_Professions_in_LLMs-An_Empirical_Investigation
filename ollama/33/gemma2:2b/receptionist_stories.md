The air in the cramped reception area at "Smith & Sons" law firm always hummed with an undercurrent of tension.  It was the kind of place where anxieties seeped through the worn carpet like spilled coffee and clung to the chipped Formica counter behind Hazel's tired eyes.  Her name, she knew, was as familiar as the scratchy phone lines and creaky filing cabinet that seemed to hold the weight of every legal battle fought in the city. 

Hazel, a woman who had weathered more than her fair share of client meltdowns and legal jargon overload, sighed as Mrs. Henderson's voice echoed through the tiny space, "Now, Ms. Harris...that contract is just not sitting right with me! You can't be sure this is in *my* best interest?"  

The day was young, but even a seasoned receptionist like Hazel knew she wasn't equipped to solve the intricacies of a multi-million dollar business dispute. A wave of resignation washed over her; sometimes, you just had to call in the big guns. 
 
**Setting:** "Smith & Sons" law firm is located on the bustling corner of 4th Avenue and Oak Street in a historic building that feels perpetually stuck between past glories and modern anxieties. The atmosphere inside is both sterile and chaotic, reflecting the intricate legal battles fought within its walls.
