Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy Hospital's intensive care unit, mimicking the tempestuous emotions churning inside Amelia "Amy" Hayes.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting sterile white circles across the faces of the dying patients in their beds. Outside, the world was drowning in a gray curtain of rain, but within these four walls, it felt like she'd been thrust into an endless black abyss where hope seemed to vanish faster than the rising tide. 

Her hands, usually so confident and steady, were shaking. Every beat of her heart echoed with a growing dread as she prepared for another round of life-saving interventions for a child, barely older than six months old, battling a rare lung infection. Amy wasn't just treating patients; she was holding the thread of their lives in her calloused hands while fighting a silent war against mortality. 


She adjusted the IV bag, its contents flowing steadily into the baby's tiny arm. A sense of urgency pulsed through her veins as she reminded herself: “Just one more hour,” she whispered to the empty room, "and then I can go home." The thought brought a sliver of light, but also a harsh reality – this was just another night in the labyrinth of Mercy, a place that had become both her sanctuary and her battleground.
