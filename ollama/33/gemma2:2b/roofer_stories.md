The late October wind bit at Edgar "Rusty" Thorne's face like a hungry wolf, whistling through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the old mill. He pulled his worn leather jacket tighter around himself as he surveyed the dilapidated structure, its once vibrant red paint now faded to a sickly brown, peeling like sunburnt skin. The wind rattled the rusted machinery within, adding a mournful melody to the symphony of decay.  

Rusty wasn't one for sentimentality, not in this line of work. He was pragmatic, his life measured by planks and nails, the rhythm of a good climb and a sturdy roof. The mill was a testament to the stubbornness of time; a crumbling relic from a forgotten era where men worked harder and laughed louder, before the world got too fast and forgot how to appreciate things that didn't scream "profit." 
But even in the desolation, Rusty saw something beautiful â€“ an echo of the past whispering in the creaking timbers. He was a man for those hidden stories, for the remnants of lives lived under different skies.  And tonight, he had a story to tell.
