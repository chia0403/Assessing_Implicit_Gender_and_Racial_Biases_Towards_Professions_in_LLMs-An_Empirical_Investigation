The fluorescent lights hummed above Ezra Thorne's head like trapped bees, their sickly yellow light reflecting off the chrome sheen of the showroom floor.  He wasn't sure if he felt more buzzed by the energy or his impending anxiety about the prospect at hand â€“ Mr. Peterson, a man who smelled vaguely of lavender and disappointment.  Mr. Peterson was one of the most notorious deal-breakers in the entire state, notorious for dragging down sales and leaving salespeople like Ezra emotionally depleted.

Ezra was young, barely 24 years old with a face too round and bright for his own good. His smile was perpetually stuck on, like a mismatched pair of clown shoes glued to his feet.  He longed to be the salesman who could charm his way out of any situation, but right now, it felt more like a game of chess played against a relentless wind. 

The air hung thick with potential and dread in "Elite Imports," the luxury car dealership nestled amongst sprawling suburban homes. It was a sea of velvet-lined booths, gleaming chrome and leather chairs, all designed to make even the most skeptical customer feel like they were stepping into their own personal paradise. Or at least that's what Ezra was supposed to be selling.  Tonight, he was determined to sell this paradise to Mr. Peterson.
