The air in Ms. Lillian's daycare was thick with the sweet scent of cinnamon from the gingerbread cookies baking in the oven. The room hummed with the joyous chaos of four-and five-year-olds: giggles bubbling up amidst the clatter of toy blocks and the high-pitched melodies of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" playing on a battered speaker system.  Ms. Lillian, her name embossed like a badge of honor on a worn apron, watched the scene unfold with an ease that bordered on grace. It was a Tuesday in November, and the first snow of winter had begun to fall gently outside the window, painting the city in a soft, grey sheen. 

Lillian's heart swelled as she noticed little Leo, who usually stayed glued to his Spiderman action figure, attempting, with surprising clumsiness, to navigate a wobbly tower built from oversized blocks. His freckled face broke into a wide grin and Ms. Lillian couldn't help but chuckle. She had witnessed countless first steps, countless tantrums, countless triumphs of innocence.  Each one was unique, etched in the folds of her memory like the worn edges of her favorite teddy bear.  Today felt especially special, a feeling that even the snow falling outside seemed to echo.
