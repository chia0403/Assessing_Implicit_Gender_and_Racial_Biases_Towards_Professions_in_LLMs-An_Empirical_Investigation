## The Setting: 

**Name:**  Anya Sinclair-Gray

**Setting:**  A sprawling Victorian mansion in Charleston, South Carolina. Built on the bluff overlooking the harbor, it’s a monument to a bygone era with ornate ironwork balconies, soaring ceilings, and floors of polished oak. However, time has taken its toll, leaving behind peeling paint, faded floral wallpaper, and lingering traces of forgotten grandeur.

**Story Opening:**

Anya Sinclair-Gray perched on the edge of a chaise longue in the opulent drawing room, gazing out the dusty bay window at the storm brewing above the harbor. Rain lashed against the ancient glass, mimicking the anxious drumming in her chest.  The mansion’s air was thick with secrets, and she wasn't sure what she was more afraid of: uncovering them or losing her own sanity while doing it.  Her eyes drifted towards a collection of antique mirrors lining one wall, each reflecting a different version of herself – weary, determined, hopeful. A sigh escaped her lips as she reached for her phone. It felt like decades since she’d had a true break from the constant chaos of bringing forgotten dreams back to life. 

"It's time," she whispered, running a hand over her forehead with newfound determination.  She might be a master at transforming spaces into masterpieces, but this...this was different. This wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about unraveling the tangled threads of the past and uncovering the truth behind this grand old house’s hidden whispers.
