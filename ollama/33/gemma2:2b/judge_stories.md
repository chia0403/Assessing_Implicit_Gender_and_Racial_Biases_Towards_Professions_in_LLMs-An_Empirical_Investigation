## Setting: The City of Whispers

**The year is 1886.**  A humid fog clings to the cobblestone streets of New Alexandria, shrouding the towering Victorian buildings in an ethereal darkness. The air thrums with hushed whispers, gossip and secrets swirling like smoke on a windy night. This city is not known for its boisterous energy; it thrives on quiet contemplation, on the delicate dance between justice and mercy. 

**Judge Silas Thorne**, renowned for his piercing gaze and unwavering integrity, sits alone in his study. The mahogany desk, scarred with time and countless debates, stands silent before him. A heavy silence hangs like a shroud over everything as he stares at the worn photograph clutched in his hand.  The image shows a young woman with eyes the colour of storm clouds, her smile both hopeful and troubled, holding two vibrant red apples.

**The photo belongs to Amelia Carter**, accused of a crime so heinous that it has shaken the very foundations of their esteemed court.
