The air hung thick with moisture and the smell of pine needles as Elara Blackwood adjusted her worn leather gloves.  Dust motes danced in the morning sun filtering through the towering Douglas firs that surrounded her small cabin on the edge of Forks National Forest. The rhythmic crunch of boots on forest floor was replaced by a low hum, a droning lullaby from the chainsaws parked nearby.  Elara wasn't fond of this newfangled "quiet cut" system the logging company had implemented â€“ it just meant more waiting for work to come her way.

A lifetime in these woods, tracing his family lineage back to when the first settlers cleared the land, Elara knew every twist of the forest path and every hidden trick of the timberline.  Today was particularly bleak; a long stretch of deadwood had caught her eye, but finding a good stand for felling had been challenging. The lumber industry had become an unforgiving beast, leaving them with scraps and half-finished trees. Elara yearned for something different, some kind of purpose beyond the endless cycle of logging.  

As she pulled on her weathered coat, she glanced at the sky, heavy with a premonition that this day might not go as planned.
