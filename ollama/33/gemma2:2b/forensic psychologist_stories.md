The case file felt cold, heavy with unanswered questions. The victim, a young musician named Liam O'Connell, had been found lifeless in his studio, a single bullet wound marring his chest.

There was something missing, a haunting disconnect that Elias felt gnawing at his insides, just as the rain outside intensified, drumming its relentless symphony on his windowpane.  

**Setting:** A secluded cottage in rural Vermont, nestled amongst rolling green hills and whispering forests. The house, a blend of classic New England architecture and modern updates, exuded an atmosphere of comfort, but Elias couldn't shake off a sense that the very walls held secrets.
