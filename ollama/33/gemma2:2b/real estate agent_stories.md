## Story Opening:

**Setting:**  The sprawling Victorian mansion in the heart of Newport’s historic district was draped in mist, as if the very walls held their breath against the chill autumn air. A lone figure stood on the sweeping porch, its silhouette starkly contrasting with the flickering gaslights illuminating the ornate carvings on the railing. The name above the door, "The Blackwood Estate," seemed almost to shimmer in the twilight.  This was where Amelia Thorne, a seasoned real estate agent known for her sharp wit and even sharper eye for detail, found herself today.

**Main Character:** Amelia Thorne.  A woman who wore expensive suits that looked like tailored armor, but whose heart belonged more to crumbling stone and forgotten histories than high-society gala's or luxury penthouse suites. She had a knack for finding the hidden gems in properties, the stories buried within each brick and mortar. But this case – Blackwood Estate – held a unique kind of intrigue.  The whispers about its past were woven into every faded picture frame and cracked windowpane. Amelia was drawn to them as moths are drawn to a flickering flame. 

**Opening Line:** "Blackwood Estate," Amelia muttered, running a calloused finger across the weathered brick. "You've got that air of secrets, don't you?"
