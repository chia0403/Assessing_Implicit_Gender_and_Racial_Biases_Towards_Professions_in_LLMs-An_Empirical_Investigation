## Opening:

Rain hammered against the greasy metal roof of the diner, each drop exploding into miniature geysers.  Dust motes danced in the weak amber glow emanating from the flickering neon sign above, casting long, distorted shadows on the worn vinyl booths. The air was thick with cigarette smoke and the unmistakable tang of stale coffee. 

This wasn't exactly a place where private detectives were supposed to be having their lunch, but for Elara Thorne, it was her office - or at least the closest thing she had to one in this sleepy, forgotten corner of New Orleans. 

She hunched over a mug of black coffee, the bitter liquid burning its way down her throat like a reminder of all the unanswered questions swirling in her mind.  A crumpled file lay open on the table, pages overflowing with grainy photos and half-written notes - the case that had brought her to this dingy diner, a case that was as shrouded in mystery as it was dangerous. 

The name scrawled across the top of the file felt like a punch to her gut: "The Nightingale."
