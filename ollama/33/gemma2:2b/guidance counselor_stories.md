## Story Opening

Rain hammered against the windows of Willow Creek High, mimicking the incessant rhythm of Ms. Eleanor Thorne’s heart. It was already pouring at the start of another school day, and she was surrounded by the usual symphony of adolescent angst. The aroma of lukewarm coffee, stale air freshener, and teenage hormones hung thick in the air like a miasma. 

Eleanor straightened her glasses, their silver frames reflecting the grey light filtering through the windowpane, and scanned the bustling hallway. She wasn’t sure why she felt so trapped within this steel-and-glass box of normalcy.  She was supposed to be guiding these students towards brighter futures, but all she saw was a storm brewing inside her own heart – a storm of doubt, fear, and an unyielding sense of failure. 

Her name, Eleanor Thorne, sounded strangely out of place in this chaotic haven. It was almost ironic considering her own seemingly stagnant life.  A single mother, working three jobs to make ends meet, Eleanor had been so determined to carve a path for her son that she’d never dared to dream about any personal happiness or fulfillment. 

And now, staring down at the mountain of unreturned student emails, she realized with a sinking feeling that maybe she hadn't even carved a *starting* path for herself yet.  Maybe it was time to learn how to navigate this storm and find her own solace amidst the chaos of teenage life.


**Setting:**

Willow Creek High School - a sprawling, suburban institution with a reputation for being less than inspiring. It’s filled with cliques, anxieties, and more unanswered emails from confused students than she could count.
