The sun beat down on Dale "Dustbowl" Thompson's cracked neck as he shifted his weight from one calloused foot to the other. The scent of diesel fuel mingled with hot asphalt and the faint, metallic tang of sweat under his worn canvas work shirt. Dustbowl was a man sculpted by the unforgiving landscape of Highway 50, his weathered face bearing the map of miles driven and countless hours spent in its company. His truck, affectionately named "The Mule," hummed like a restless giant as he surveyed the stretch of highway before him – a ribbon of grey cutting through the red earth.  

Dustbowl stood at the edge of a small desert town called Dust Devil Springs. The only sound was the ceaseless drone of his toolbox's internal mechanism, a counterpoint to the wind whispering tales of abandoned dreams and forgotten promises. In the distance, an old motel sign flickered erratically like a dying spark in the harsh midday sun.  Dustbowl had seen it all - more than he cared to remember, yet somehow, this place seemed different today – charged with a strange energy that left him momentarily unsure of his footing. 

The Mule's engine sputtered and coughed, finally settling into a quiet rumble. Dustbowl took a swig from his water bottle, the cool liquid hitting his parched throat. He felt a sense of foreboding he couldn't shake off. This stretch was notoriously volatile, where the desert met the highway, where ancient spirits were said to linger in the twilight. It was here, on this desolate stretch of asphalt and red clay, that Dustbowl felt himself at odds with the world – not just a worker but something more, something darker.
