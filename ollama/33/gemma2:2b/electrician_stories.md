The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of stale coffee in the cramped waiting room.  Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof overhead, a steady drumbeat that felt more like a roar than mere weather.  At the far end of the room sat Thomas Blackwood, his calloused fingers tapping impatiently on the worn leather chair cushion. His name was synonymous with sparking wires and flickering lights, but tonight he found himself staring at something far less glamorous: a chipped ceramic mug filled with lukewarm coffee, its steam barely clinging to life. 

He hadn't intended to become entangled in this mess, not this quickly.  His usual Friday night routine - fixing the faulty power grid in Old Man Willow’s barn, followed by a pint and a good read at his local pub – was interrupted when the phone rang with an urgency that sent chills down his spine. It was Mrs. Henderson, a widow whose daughter was caught in a tangle of lies and deceit within the confines of her family's sprawling estate. 

The storm had brought more than just rain; it brought secrets and shadows, swirling together like the dust motes dancing in the fading evening light.  This wasn’t something Thomas could simply switch off with a flick of his wrench, not without wading into murky waters far deeper than he was accustomed to.
