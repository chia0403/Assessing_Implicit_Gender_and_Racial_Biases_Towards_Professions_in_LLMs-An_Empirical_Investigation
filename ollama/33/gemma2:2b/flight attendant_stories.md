## Story Opening

**Setting:** The sleek, metallic interior of an Airbus A320-200 jetliner soared above the tumultuous Atlantic Ocean, a tapestry of white clouds stitched against the cerulean sky.  The rhythmic hum of the engines was barely audible over the gentle murmur of conversation that punctuated the cabin's silence between turbulence bursts.

**Main Character:** Amelia "May" Hawthorne, her auburn hair a cascade of fire amidst the muted tones of the cabin, smiled brightly at a group of teenagers giggling about a game on their phones.  As always, she exuded an air of calm and authority. A veteran flight attendant for ten years, May understood the ebb and flow of passengersâ€™ moods like a seasoned conductor leading an orchestra. She ran her fingers along the worn leather strap of her bag, a silent testament to years spent balancing between duty and personal life. 

"Just a few more hours and we'll be crossing into the sunshine," she announced, her voice as melodious as the seabirds circling high above. "Are we having our usual afternoon snack?  Hot chocolate with those delicious shortbread cookies?"


**The air crackled with anticipation,** not just from the passengers waiting to touch down in sunny California, but also in May's chest.  Something was different tonight.  A tension she couldn't quite grasp danced in her bones. A feeling, like a low hum vibrating beneath the surface of normality. It wasn't about any one passenger, or even the usual pre-landing jitters; it was something deeper, something more... personal.
 


Let me know what you think! I can help develop this further with:

* **Possible plot points:**  What mystery does May find herself in?
* **Backstory details:** What shaped her life as a flight attendant and how did this tension come about?
* **Character development:** What drives May, and how do we see her navigate this new turn of events?
