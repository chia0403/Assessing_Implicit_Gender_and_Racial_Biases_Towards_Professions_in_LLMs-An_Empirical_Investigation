The rain hammered against the storefront windows of "All Things Bright", blurring the already-dim streetlights into swirling streaks of purple and grey. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Carter nervously smoothed her uniform skirt, its crispness a stark contrast to the storm raging outside. It was another slow Tuesday evening at the local thrift shop, and she’d be lucky to sell even half the overflowing donation boxes before closing time. She glanced at the clock: 7:15 PM. The fluorescent hum of the store seemed to amplify the rhythmic drumming of the rain.

Amy hated evenings like this.  Not because of the work itself – though the constant flow of unwanted treasures was a neverending stream – but because she felt utterly invisible. Even when customers came through, she was always behind the counter, just another face flitting between stacks of books and chipped china, her words rarely more than "Can I help you?" 

She missed her mother's laugh in the morning. She missed the way her father would always catch her eye as he walked past the shop.  Amy had been trying to escape their expectations for years now - she yearned for something bigger, for a life that wasn’t defined by the routine of the cashier’s register.
