Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of "Leaky Pete's Plumbing", drumming out a frantic rhythm to the symphony of howling winds outside. Inside, 28-year-old Bartholomew "Barty" Featherstone was hunched over a rusted wrench, his brow creased with concentration as he tried to coax loose a stubborn pipe coupling.  The workshop, cluttered and smelling of old grease and stale coffee, hummed with the quiet whirring of his trusty toolbox, its contents familiar companions in the face of seemingly endless plumbing woes. Barty had seen it all: leaky faucets that threatened to flood entire basements, sewer lines choked with a dozen layers of grime, pipes that sang operatically when they burst. 

He'd inherited the family business from his father, who'd passed away last year, leaving him alone in this world of dripping faucets and clogged drains.  Barty wasn't complaining, not really. He loved the tangible satisfaction of repairing a problem, the knowledge that he was part of something bigger than himself - a silent hero for those caught in the relentless chaos of their plumbing nightmares. But tonight, Barty was feeling particularly weary. His usual pep had been sucked out by years of battling leaky sinks and temperamental toilets. Even the promise of another night's work at the local nursing home wasn't quite filling his soul these days.
