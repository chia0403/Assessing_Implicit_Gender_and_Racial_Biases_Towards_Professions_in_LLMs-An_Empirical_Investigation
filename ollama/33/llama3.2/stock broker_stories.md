Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the Manhattan skyline, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers of Wall Street. The sound of honking cars and chatter from pedestrians filled the air as people rushed to and fro, each with their own destination in mind.

In a high-rise office building on the 20th floor, Reginald Everett Thompson III sat at his desk, staring intently at the trading screens in front of him. As a top-performing stock broker at the prestigious investment firm, Thompson & Co., Reggie, as he was known to his colleagues, had made a name for himself as a shrewd and ruthless deal-maker.

Reggie's eyes scanned the screens, his mind racing with the complexities of the market. He was waiting for the opening bell, when the stocks would begin to fluctuate based on news and economic data from around the world. With millions of dollars riding on every trade, Reggie took his role very seriously.

At 38 years old, Reggie had it all - a high-paying job, a beautiful wife, and two adorable kids. But beneath the surface, he was haunted by the weight of his family's legacy and the pressure to live up to his father's expectations. As the opening bell approached, Reggie steeled himself for another day of high-stakes trading, where only the strongest would survive.

How does this sound?
