Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans glistened like polished obsidian as Agent Olivia Mae LeBlanc stepped out of her office building on Bourbon Street. The dimly lit alleyways seemed to close in around her, casting long shadows that stretched like skeletal fingers across the pavement. It was a night like any other in the Big Easy, where the jazz flowed through the streets and the whispers of the city's secrets lingered in every corner.

Olivia, a 35-year-old insurance agent with a sharp mind and a quick wit, adjusted her bright pink raincoat as she gazed out at the crowded street. She had spent the day navigating the bureaucratic red tape of the state's department of insurance, only to emerge with a handful of new clients and a nagging feeling that something was off.

As she walked towards the nearby café on Jackson Square, Olivia couldn't shake the sense that she was being watched. The city's eternal fog of chaos seemed to be settling around her like a shroud, and for the first time in years, she felt truly alone in her own skin.

Little did she know, tonight would bring a storm of its own – one that would test her mettle as an agent, and push her to the very limits of her courage.
