Opening:

"As she stood at the edge of the ancient ruins, her eyes scanning the intricate carvings that covered the crumbling stone walls, Sophia Elena Vasquez took a deep breath of the salty air and felt a thrill of excitement coursing through her veins. She loved being a tour guide in the small town of Tulum on Mexico's Caribbean coast, where the lush jungle gave way to turquoise waters and the scent of frangipani filled the air. It was moments like these that made all the early mornings, long days, and endless questions about the Mayan gods worthwhile."

Setting:

Tulum, Mexico

The story takes place in the small coastal town of Tulum, which is nestled on a peninsula overlooking the Caribbean Sea. The town is surrounded by lush jungle and features ancient ruins, including the famous Tulum National Park, a collection of Mayan temples and artifacts that date back to the 13th century.

Sophia Elena Vasquez, the main character, is a tour guide who has grown up in Tulum and knows its secrets and stories intimately.

But as she stands at the edge of the ruins, she can't shake the feeling that something is off - a sense of unease that settles in the pit of her stomach like a stone. Little does she know, this will be just the beginning of an adventure that will take her beyond the boundaries of the tour group and into the heart of the mystery itself.
