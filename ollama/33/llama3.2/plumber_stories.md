Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Ravenswood, where the misty veil of the nearby forest seemed to cling to the streets like a damp shroud. The rain pounded against the pavement outside the offices of "Raven & Sons Plumbing," a family-owned business that had been serving the community for generations.

Inside, 32-year-old Emrys Felix Raven sat hunched over his workbench, surrounded by tangled pipes and discarded tools. He was a master plumber with a quick mind and a more-than-faithful right hand, courtesy of his father's accident a few years prior. With a pipe wrench clutched in his calloused grip, Emrys was wrestling with the particularly stubborn drain that had been plaguing Mrs. Jenkins' kitchen for weeks.

The phone on his desk jolted him out of his concentration, shrill and insistent. Emrys sighed, wiped the sweat from his brow, and picked up the receiver. "Raven & Sons Plumbing, this is Emrys speaking."
