Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Willow Creek, nestled in the heart of rural Ohio. The streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to find shelter from the rain. Inside the local pharmacy, "Johnson's Apothecary," pharmacist Emily Jane Wilson stood behind the counter, her eyes scanning the rows of shelves stacked with jars of potions and bottles of medications. She had spent years perfecting her craft, learning the intricacies of traditional remedies and modern pharmaceuticals from her father, who had founded the pharmacy decades ago.

As she helped a regular customer fill his prescription for blood pressure medication, Emily's mind wandered to the strange occurrence that had been plaguing the town for weeks - a series of mysterious illnesses that seemed to be afflicting more than just the elderly and infirm. People of all ages were falling ill with symptoms that defied explanation: feverless fevers, numbness in the extremities, and an unshakeable sense of dread that seemed to cling to their skin like a shroud.

The police had been stumped, and the local hospital was at capacity as patients flooded its emergency room. Emily had always prided herself on her sharp mind and quick thinking, but this latest puzzle had her stumped. She couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was lurking just beneath the surface of Willow Creek's idyllic fa√ßade.

As she handed the customer his medication with a reassuring smile, Emily's eyes drifted to the old, leather-bound book on the top shelf of the counter - a family heirloom passed down from her great-grandmother, a respected healer and medicine woman in her own right. The title, "The Whispering Remedies," seemed particularly intriguing tonight, as if it held some hidden key to unraveling the mystery plaguing their town.

And with that thought, Emily's fingers began to itch for more than just dispensing pills - she felt an insatiable urge to dig deeper into the secrets of her own past and the mysterious traditions of her family, in the hopes of uncovering a solution to the strange illnesses that were slowly draining Willow Creek dry.
