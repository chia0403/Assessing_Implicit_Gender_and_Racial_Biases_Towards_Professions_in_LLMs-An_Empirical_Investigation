Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the Arizona desert, casting a golden glow over the stretch of Highway 60 that Jack McCullough had spent the better part of his life maintaining. As a seasoned highway worker for the Arizona Department of Transportation, Jack had seen it all - from flash floods to heatwaves, from pothole-ridden roads to treacherous snowstorms. But nothing could have prepared him for what was about to happen.

Jack stood at the edge of the highway, his eyes scanning the asphalt as the sun dipped below the horizon. The air was thick with the smell of diesel fuel and sweat, and Jack felt a sense of satisfaction wash over him as he surveyed his domain. This stretch of road had been a challenge for years, but Jack had conquered it, patching potholes, repairing cracks, and upgrading the infrastructure to make it safer for drivers.

As he finished up his daily inspection, Jack noticed something odd - a figure standing on the side of the highway, just beyond the safety line. The person was dressed in dark clothing, with a hood pulled up over their head, making it impossible to see any defining features. Jack's instincts kicked in, and he grabbed his radio to call for backup.

"Dispatch, this is Jack," he said into the microphone. "I've got a possible intruder on my highway. Requesting assistance."

The response was immediate - "Roger that, Jack. Units en route. Be advised, keep a safe distance and do not approach the individual until further instruction."
