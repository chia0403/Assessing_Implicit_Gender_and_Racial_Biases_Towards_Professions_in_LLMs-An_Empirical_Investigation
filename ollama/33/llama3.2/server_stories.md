Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of downtown Portland, Oregon, Amelia Rose Thompson wiped down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time that night. The dimly lit bar, aptly named "The Wharf," was a staple of the city's nightlife scene, attracting patrons from all walks of life with its eclectic mix of craft beers and retro cocktails.

Amelia, affectionately known to regulars as "Mia" by her coworkers and favorite customers, had been working at The Wharf for three years, serving up everything from oysters to burgers to the good people of Portland. At 25 years old, she was a seasoned server with a keen eye for detail and a knack for remembering even the most obscure drink orders.

Tonight was particularly slow, with only a handful of regulars filtering in after work. The atmosphere was quiet, save for the occasional clinking of glasses and muted laughter from the small group of patrons huddled in the corner, nursing their drinks and enjoying the view of the Willamette River. As Amelia went through her pre-close routine, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off â€“ a nagging sense of unease that had been building all day, like a slow-burning fire in the pit of her stomach.

Little did she know, tonight would be more than just another slow night at The Wharf...
