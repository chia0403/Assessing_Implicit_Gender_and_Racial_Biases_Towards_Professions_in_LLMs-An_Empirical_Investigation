Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The snow fell gently over the sleepy town of Ravenshire, casting a serene silence over its cobblestone streets and quaint shops. Amidst the quiet morning scene, a single light flickered to life in the doorway of "Harrison & Sons Butchers," a family-run business that had been a staple on Main Street for generations.

At 28, Emrys "Em" Harrison was the new owner of the butcher shop, having taken over from his recently retired father. A skilled craftsman with a passion for quality meats and old-world traditions, Em had spent years learning the trade from his father before moving back to Ravenshire to take on the challenge of running the family business.

As he stepped out into the crisp air, Em breathed in deeply, savoring the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth that filled the valley. It was a smell he'd grown up with, one that transported him back to his childhood spent exploring the woods behind the shop. But as he looked around at the familiar yet changed landscape of Ravenshire, Em couldn't shake the feeling that something was off â€“ a sense of unease that had been growing in the pit of his stomach for weeks.

Little did Em know, this quiet morning would be the first step on a journey that would take him down a rabbit hole of secrets and lies, forcing him to confront the very heart of his community and his own family's legacy.
