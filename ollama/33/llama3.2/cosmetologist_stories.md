Inside his small salon, "Hair by Ryder Jackson", 25-year-old Ryder Jackson expertly crafted a flawless blowout for a client, his hands moving with precision and confidence as he worked to tame the unruly locks.

He was supposed to be meeting his sister, Luna, at the local coffee shop in 20 minutes - she had promised to fill him in on the latest gossip from their family's annual summer gathering, and Ryder couldn't wait to hear all about it.
