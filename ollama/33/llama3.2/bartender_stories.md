The neon sign creaked in the gentle ocean breeze as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the small coastal town of Tidal Cove. The smell of saltwater and fried dough wafted from the beachside eateries, mingling with the sound of seagulls crying overhead.

Inside the local watering hole, "The Drunken Mermaid," bartender KaidÃ«n "Kai" Blackwood polished a mug with a white apron, his eyes scanning the crowded bar as he expertly mixed drinks for the evening's patrons. The dimly lit room was filled with the sounds of laughter and clinking glasses, the air thick with the promise of a night to remember.

Kai had worked at The Drunken Mermaid since he was 19, learning the ins and outs of mixology from his gruff but lovable mentor, Jack. Over the years, he'd developed a reputation as one of the best bartenders in town, known for his creative concoctions and warm smile. But despite the familiar routine, Kai couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of restlessness had been building inside him lately, like the ocean tide waiting to break free.

As he slid a frothy pint down the bar to a waiting customer, Kai's gaze drifted out into the fading light, his eyes searching for the one person who could make this feeling feel almost manageable: his best friend and confidant, Lyra. Where was she tonight?
