The whir of the antique Singer sewing machine filled Amelia Clementine Worthington's tiny office with a familiar comforting hum. The melody was always loudest just before Mr. Fitzwilliam, her employer, arrived for his morning dictation. It felt like their own private song, a soundtrack to the meticulous dance of transcribing his ramblings about historical inaccuracies in popular novels into neatly typed documents. 

Amelia perched on the edge of her rickety wooden chair, her fingertips tracing the worn velvet of the letter opener resting beside her. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, casting long shadows across the cluttered desk and the piles of books threatening to topple onto the floor. The walls were a tapestry of faded wallpaper adorned with botanical illustrations, their colors bleached by years of sunshine filtering through the grime-coated glass. 

Her office, tucked away on the third floor of a sprawling Victorian mansion in London's bustling Bloomsbury district, felt worlds away from the clamor of the city below. It was a sanctuary of dusty tomes, whispered secrets, and the comforting rhythm of Mr. Fitzwilliam's eccentric pronouncements.  


But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced along Amelia's spine, urging her to glance at the clock â€“ ten minutes past eight. He was always punctual, never missing his morning ritual by so much as a second.
