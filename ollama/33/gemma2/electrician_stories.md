The humid Florida air hung heavy, thick with the scent of salt and impending rain. Lightning flickered on the horizon, casting jagged shadows across the corrugated tin roof of the dilapidated beach shack. Inside,  Electra "Ellie" Jones wrestled with a tangle of frayed wiring, her brow furrowed in concentration. 

Sweat beaded on her forehead, mingling with the grime that clung to her overalls. Ellie, with her calloused hands and grease-stained toolbox, was as much a fixture of this ramshackle haven as the weathered wood panelling and peeling paint. Her family had owned this beach shack for generations, its salty breeze whispering tales of bygone summers and forgotten dreams.  

Today, however, Ellie wasn't lost in nostalgia. The storm brewing outside threatened to knock out the power grid again, leaving the entire coastal town in darkness. And without her electrical expertise, there would be no light guiding the way through the coming night.
