The sun beat down on Silas Finnigan's back like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat slicked his brow, stinging his eyes as he strained to lift another cinder block onto the skeletal frame of what would soon be Mrs. Peterson's dream kitchen.  Dust swirled around him, a gritty cloud stirred by the whirring blades of the distant cement mixer. 

Silas wiped his face with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime across his cheek. He glanced up at the half-built house in front of him, a stark outline against the azure sky. This wasn't his dream kitchen, but it was another brick laid on the path to his own: a cozy cottage by the lake, with a porch swing and a garden overflowing with tomatoes.  He just had to keep swinging this hammer, one block at a time. 


The setting is a rural town in the American Midwest during summer. Construction work is booming as the housing market heats up.
