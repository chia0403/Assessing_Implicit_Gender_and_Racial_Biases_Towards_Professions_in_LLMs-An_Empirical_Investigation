Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Blackwood's office, mimicking the tempest brewing within her own mind. The flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across the worn leather armchair where Mrs. Hemmings sat perched, clutching a handkerchief to her trembling lips.  Eleanor’s gaze drifted from the woman's anxious face to the rain-streaked view of London beyond the window – a city shrouded in an oppressive blanket of grey, reflecting the mood that hung heavy in the air. 

The year was 1897, and Eleanor, though brilliant and respected, found herself increasingly isolated within the confines of her small practice in Mayfair. The whispers followed her - rumours of unorthodox methods, a penchant for delving into the darkest recesses of the mind. But Eleanor cared little for gossip. She sought truth, even if it lay buried beneath layers of denial and fear. 

As Mrs. Hemmings choked out her plea – a story of nightmares, insomnia, and an overwhelming sense of dread – Eleanor felt a familiar tug in her gut, a spark of morbid curiosity igniting within her. This was more than just another case of nervous exhaustion. There was something sinister lurking beneath the surface, something that whispered of ancient secrets and forgotten terrors.
