The rhythmic thump of cleavers against bone was a familiar lullaby to Elias Blackwood. He worked with the precision of a surgeon, his calloused hands gliding over slabs of beef, pork, and lamb as he dissected them with practiced ease. His shop, "Blackwood's Provisions," nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Havenport, was a place where time seemed to move differently. The air hung thick with the scent of cured meats and freshly ground spices, a pungent aroma that clung to Eliasâ€™ worn leather apron like a second skin. 

Havenport itself was a city steeped in history, its ancient walls whispering tales of bygone eras. Despite its quaint charm, Havenport harbored secrets beneath its cobblestone streets and gaslight lamps. A darkness lurked within the shadows, waiting for an unsuspecting soul to stumble into its grasp.  Elias, with his weathered face and knowing eyes, had seen more than his fair share of that darkness, but he chose to focus on the warmth of the hearth, the comforting smell of roasted meat, and the simple act of providing sustenance for his community. 

Little did he know, however, that a storm was brewing on the horizon, one that would force him to confront the darkness head-on and unravel secrets buried deep within Havenport's heart.
