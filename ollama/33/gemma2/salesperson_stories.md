The midday sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne's shoulders as she adjusted her tie-dye sales uniform – a vibrant swirl of purple and orange that clashed spectacularly with the beige walls of Discount Emporium. She squinted at the flickering "Open" sign above the door, hoping for a customer who wasn't just browsing for bargain bins of expired cereal and dented pots. 

The store itself was a relic of a bygone era – fluorescent lights buzzing overhead, dusty aisles crammed with forgotten gadgets and mismatched furniture, and the scent of stale coffee permeating the air. It was a far cry from the sleek, modern boutiques Amy had dreamed of working in, but rent in this part of town was cheap, and she needed every penny to keep afloat after her divorce.  

Amy took a deep breath, plastered a smile on her face, and prepared herself for another long afternoon selling discounted dreams in a dusty purgatory of retail.
