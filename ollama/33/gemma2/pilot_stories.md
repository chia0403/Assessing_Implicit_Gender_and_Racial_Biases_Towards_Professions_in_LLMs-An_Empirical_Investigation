The air was thick with the smell of ozone and jet fuel, a familiar perfume to Captain Amelia “Ace” Thorne. Her boots echoed on the steel grating as she walked towards the gargantuan silver beast that was her pride and joy: the Aurora Borealis, a custom-built X-wing fighter painted in shades of midnight blue and celestial green. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the bustling hangar bay of  Skyhold Station, a sprawling spaceport nestled amidst the jagged peaks of Kepler-186f's northern continent. The air vibrated with the hum of countless engines, the rhythmic clatter of machinery, and the excited chatter of pilots and engineers preparing for another night’s journey into the vast expanse of the Orion Arm.  Ace ran a gloved hand over the Aurora's smooth hull, feeling the cool metal beneath her fingertips. 


"Ready for another run, Ace?"

The voice belonged to Jax, her co-pilot and best friend, leaning against the boarding ramp with a cocky grin. He was already strapped in, humming a tuneless melody as he checked his console.  Ace returned the grin, feeling a familiar surge of adrenaline course through her veins.


"Just you wait, Jax," she said, her voice laced with playful challenge. "Tonight, we're gonna paint the sky."
