The acrid bite of smoke stung Amelia "Amy" Hayes' nostrils as she burst through the door. Flames danced greedily inside the modest two-story house, casting grotesque shadows that twisted on the charred furniture and broken walls.  A thin layer of soot coated everything, blurring the edges of reality into a monochrome nightmare. 

The small town of Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, wasn't known for dramatic fires. Amy, a veteran EMT with five years under her belt at the local station, had seen her share of accidents and emergencies - broken bones, car crashes, the occasional heart attack. But thisâ€¦ This was different.

The air crackled with urgency, the heat an oppressive wave that threatened to knock her back.  Through the haze, she saw a figure slumped against the wall, barely visible in the flickering light. A child. 


Her training kicked in, a calm efficiency replacing the immediate panic. "I'm here! Can you hear me?" Her voice was amplified by her helmet and carried through the suffocating smoke. 

The silence that answered was more terrifying than any scream. Amy knew time was of the essence. The child's life hung precariously in the balance, a fragile thread against the inferno that threatened to consume them both.
