The stale air in the open house hung thick with the scent of lemon-scented cleaning products and desperation.  Abigail Penelope "Abby" Brighton adjusted her smile, forcing it to be as bright and welcoming as the faux sunflowers adorning every surface. The Victorian home, once a stately beauty, now sagged under the weight of neglect. Peeling paint whispered tales of forgotten grandeur, while floorboards creaked like arthritic bones beneath her heels.

Abby hated open houses in homes like this. They were soul-sucking exercises in forced cheer, where she played the role of hopeful cheerleader for a property that had long since lost its spark. She was starting to feel the familiar prickle of disappointment creeping up her spine, a sensation that came with every listing that failed to sell. It wasn't just about the commission; it was about connecting people with their dreams. These weren't just houses; they were canvases for new beginnings, and sometimes Abby felt like she was failing them both. 


This time, though, something was different. A flicker of movement in the overgrown garden caught her eye. She squinted, a spark of curiosity replacing the dull ache of routine. There, amidst the tangled roses and weeds, stood a figure cloaked in shadow. The visitor didn't seem to notice her gaze, lost instead in their contemplation of the crumbling stone wall.  

Abby straightened, pushing aside the doubts that threatened to consume her. Maybe, just maybe, this wasn't another lost soul seeking solace in a forgotten home. Maybe, this was someone who could see its potential. Someone like her.
