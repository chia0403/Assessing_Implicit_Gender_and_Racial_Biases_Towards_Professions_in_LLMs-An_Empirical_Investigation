The rhythmic clack of tiny plastic balls against polished wood filled the air, punctuated by the occasional sigh or frustrated grunt. Amelia "Amy" Rose, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, watched as Mr. Henderson struggled to maneuver his hand through the dexterity course. A frown creased her forehead as he fumbled with the pegs, his tremors making the task nearly impossible. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the occupational therapy room, bathing everything in an orange glow. Outside, the humid summer air hung heavy, buzzing with cicadas and the distant hum of traffic on the nearby highway. Inside, the room remained cool and sterile, smelling faintly of antiseptic and paper towels. Posters depicting simplified anatomical diagrams adorned the walls alongside inspirational quotes about resilience and progress. 

Amy knew Mr. Henderson was a proud man, his Parkinson's disease chipping away at his independence day by day. She could see the frustration simmering beneath his surface, but she also saw the flicker of hope in his eyes whenever he managed to complete even a single task on the course.  It wasn't just about the physical therapy; it was about reminding him that he still had control, that there were still small victories to be won. 


She cleared her throat, "How are we feeling today, Mr. Henderson?" Amy asked, her voice calm and encouraging.
