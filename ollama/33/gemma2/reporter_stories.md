The stale air in the pressroom hung heavy with disappointment and cigarette smoke. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her auburn hair pulled back tight in a braid that threatened to unravel with each frustrated sigh, slammed her laptop shut.  Another dead end. The story of the missing lighthouse keeper had become an obsession, a tangled web she couldn't untangle. 

The coastal town of Saltwind, Maine, was usually a picture postcard of quaint charm - weathered clapboard houses clinging to steep cliffs, salty air whipping through cobblestone streets, and the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore providing a constant soundtrack. But lately, the town wore an air of unease. The lighthouse, normally a beacon of hope for weary sailors, stood dark and silent, its once-bright light extinguished like a dying ember.  

It had been three weeks since Silas Blackwood, the keeper of Saltwind's legendary lighthouse, vanished without a trace. No note, no struggle, just an empty cot in his spartan quarters and the unsettling stillness of a silent sentinel watching over the restless sea. Ellie, new to Saltwind but desperate for her first big break, was determined to uncover the truth behind the missing keeper.  But with each passing day, the whispers turned louder, the theories wilder, and the fear more palpable. 


Ellie took a deep drag from her cigarette, its tip glowing like a malevolent eye in the gloom. She needed to find something, anything, that would lead her closer to Silas Blackwood.  The clock was ticking, and Saltwind held its breath.
