The rusted weathervane creaked like an arthritic finger against the storm-wracked sky, its arrow stubbornly pointing east despite the wind howling from the west. Rain lashed against the crumbling stone walls of Fort Aethelred, each drop a tiny hammer blow against centuries of history. Inside, by the flickering light of a dying hearth, stood Elara Silvershield, her armor clanking softly as she paced. The storm was nothing new to her – she’d weathered hundreds in this desolate corner of Eldoria, but tonight, a chill deeper than the wind gnawed at her. 


Elara was more than just a guard; she was the last remaining sentinel of Fort Aethelred, a crumbling fortress perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Sea of Storms. Her father had been the previous warden, and before him, his father, a lineage stretching back generations who swore to protect this land from the horrors whispered about in hushed tones by the firelight. But now, with every passing storm, Elara felt that line wavering, the shadows creeping closer than ever. 


Tonight, the shadows felt particularly close.
