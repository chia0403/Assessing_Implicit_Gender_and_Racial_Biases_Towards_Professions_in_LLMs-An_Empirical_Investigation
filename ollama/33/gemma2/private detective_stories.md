The air in the diner was thick with the scent of stale coffee and greasy bacon. A lone fly buzzed around a flickering fluorescent light above Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's head, its persistence mirroring her own as she sifted through the crumpled photographs spread across the sticky table. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon glow of the 'Open 24 Hours' sign outside.

Eleanor Vance, all five foot two of her with a fiery red bob and eyes that seemed to hold both weariness and steely determination, tapped a thumbnail against the faded picture in front of her. It was a young woman, barely out of her teens, smiling shyly into the camera. 

"Amelia Harper," Ellie muttered under her breath, tracing the outline of Amelia's face with a calloused fingertip. "Missing for six weeks, last seen walking home from work."  The case file lay open before her, a jumble of dead ends and unanswered questions. Another missing person in this city that swallowed its own citizens whole, leaving behind nothing but whispers and heartache. 


This was Ellie Vance's world â€“ the shadowy underbelly of New Orleans, where secrets festered like mold in damp alleys and truth was often harder to find than a decent cup of coffee after midnight.
