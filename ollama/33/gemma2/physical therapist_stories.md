The rhythmic rasp of sandpaper against wood filled Amelia Beatrice Carter’s small office. It wasn't her usual calming soundtrack - usually it was gentle jazz or the chirping of birds from the outdoor patio - but today, she had an unusual project on the go. A hand-carved wooden model of a hip joint sat precariously on a workbench in the corner, meticulously being smoothed by Amelia herself. She wasn't just any physical therapist; she was a craftsman too, driven to understand her patients' movements not just through touch and observation, but through tangible creation. 

Her office, nestled within a bustling community center on the outskirts of Asheville, North Carolina, was a testament to this philosophy. Sunlight streamed through large windows, illuminating rows of brightly colored exercise bands and weights alongside shelves crammed with anatomical models and hand-drawn diagrams. A faint scent of sandalwood from her latest carving project mingled with the herbal tea steeping in the corner. 

But Amelia’s peaceful haven was about to be disrupted. The sound of the bell above the door jingled, heralding the arrival of her next patient - a man named Thomas who had arrived with more baggage than just his physical ailments. He seemed like he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders, and Amelia knew she wasn't just treating his fractured ankle; she was about to embark on a journey into his soul.
