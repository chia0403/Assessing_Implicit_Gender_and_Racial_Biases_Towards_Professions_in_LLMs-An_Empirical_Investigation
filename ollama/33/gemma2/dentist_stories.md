The scent of antiseptic clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a second skin. She liked it. It smelled clean, efficient, promising. 

Eleanor surveyed her bustling practice - "Smile Bright Dental" - with its cheerfully yellow walls and strategically placed posters showcasing pearly whites. The waiting room hummed with the low murmur of anxieties and the rhythmic tick-tock of a vintage clock on the wall. A toddler whined softly in the corner, his mother trying to distract him with a worn picture book about dinosaurs. 

Outside, the midday sun beat down on the bustling city streets of New York. It was a stark contrast to the cool, sterile world within her practice. Eleanor, however, found comfort in the predictability of it all. Each day brought a stream of patients, each with their own unique set of dental woes and anxieties. 

She took a deep breath, smoothing down her crisp white lab coat. Another day, another smile saved.
