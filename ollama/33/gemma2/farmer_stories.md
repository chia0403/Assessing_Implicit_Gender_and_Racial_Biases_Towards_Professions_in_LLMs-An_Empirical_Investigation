A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves, whispering promises of a bountiful harvest. This was Silasâ€™s lifeblood, every acre of this land a testament to generations of Blackwoods who had tilled it, nurtured it, and lived by its bounty. He was fourth generation on this patch of earth, his ancestors' spirits lingering like phantoms in the rustling corn stalks. But this year felt different. A creeping unease gnawed at him, a disquiet that ran deeper than the usual anxieties of weather and pests. Something was amiss in the land, something unsettlingly out of place in the familiar rhythm of life on Blackwood Farm.
