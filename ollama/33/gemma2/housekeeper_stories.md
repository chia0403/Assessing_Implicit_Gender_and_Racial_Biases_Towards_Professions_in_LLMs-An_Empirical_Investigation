The scent of beeswax polish clung to Elsie Beatrice Merriweather like a second skin. It was the smell of order, of control, of a world she could meticulously shape with her feather duster and floorcloth. The grand Victorian mansion she called home, not in the sense of ownership, but in the way a sparrow might nest in an old clock tower, was a symphony of polished brass, mahogany furniture, and hushed hallways. Elsie moved through it with the practiced grace of a dancer, anticipating each creak of the floorboards, each sigh of the aging pipes, each glint of dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun. 

Today, however, the symphony was off-key. A low hum vibrated through the house, a disconcerting drone that Elsie couldn't place. It started subtly, like the distant thrumming of an engine, then intensified, becoming a persistent murmur that echoed in her bones. The air itself felt charged, prickling with an unsettling energy.  


Something was wrong.
