The humid Florida air clung to Coach Amelia "Amy" Blackwood like a damp towel as she surveyed the field. The August sun beat down mercilessly on the worn patches of grass, baking the artificial turf beneath her cleats into a shimmering mirage. A gaggle of teenage boys, glistening with sweat and radiating adolescent energy, sprawled across benches in various states of boredom and pre-game jitters. They were her team, the Coral Gables Cobras, and Amy was about to lead them into their first scrimmage of the season. 

The air crackled with anticipation, a familiar mix of excitement and nervous tension that always preceded a game.  Amy adjusted her visor, trying to quell the butterflies fluttering in her own stomach. This wasn't just any scrimmage. It was the first step on a journey she hoped would lead them all - herself included - to something bigger, something truly special.
