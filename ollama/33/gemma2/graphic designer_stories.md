The midday sun slanted through the grimy windows of "Pixel Pushers," casting long rectangles of light onto Elena Gabriela Ramirez's cluttered desk.

But Elena, fueled by a stubborn streak thicker than her latest latte, was determined to prove that even the most uninspired institution could benefit from a little visual magic.
