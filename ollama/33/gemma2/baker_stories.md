The air hung heavy with the scent of cinnamon and rising dough in Amelia Beatrice Everleigh's bakery. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above the worn wooden counter where Amelia kneaded a mountain of rye flour, her brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, Bathgate High Street buzzed with its usual morning chaos - delivery vans honking, children chasing pigeons, and the rhythmic clang of Mrs. McGillicuddy's antique bell announcing the opening of her flower shop across the street.  

But within Amelia's bakery, "Amelia's Angels," a quiet calm prevailed. The only sounds were the rhythmic thud of Amelia's hands against the dough and the gentle humming of the old oven in the corner, its brick facade dusted with flour like a layer of ancient snow. 


This small haven nestled in the heart of Bathgate was more than just a bakery for Amelia; it was her sanctuary, her escape from the storm that had been her life lately. She poured her heart and soul into every loaf, every croissant, every delicate sugar flower she crafted, hoping to find solace in the simple magic of baking.
