Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the turbulent emotions churning within Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne. The dim light of her desk lamp cast long shadows across the cluttered office, illuminating stacks of legal briefs, half-empty coffee mugs, and the faint scent of burnt rosemary from a forgotten attempt at cooking earlier that day.  Amelia, known to most as Amy, ran a hand through her tangled dark hair, weariness clinging to her like the damp chill seeping in from the storm outside. 

The city of Alderwood, usually bustling with life even at this late hour, was tonight cloaked in a veil of grey, the wind howling like a hungry beast down the narrow streets. The once vibrant neon signs now seemed to flicker precariously, their colours washed out by the relentless rain. It was the kind of night that made Amy want to curl up under a blanket and forget about the world, especially with the monumental case she was facing tomorrow â€“ one that could make or break her career.
