The biting wind whipped Dr. Anya Petrov’s dark hair across her face as she hurried down the cobbled street. A flurry of snowflakes danced around her ankles, turning the already narrow alley into a treacherous maze. Above her, the sky was the colour of bruised plums, promising more snow than anyone in this quaint Scottish village could handle. 

Anya adjusted the worn leather strap of her medical bag, its weight comforting against her hip. She wasn't due at the clinic until later, but Mrs. MacAllister’s frantic call had left her with no choice.  The old woman’s persistent cough had worsened overnight, and Anya knew it was more than just a common cold.  This village, nestled in the shadow of the imposing Cairngorms, was used to coughs and sniffles, but something felt different about this one.

The clinic itself, a rambling stone building with ivy clinging precariously to its walls, loomed before her like a comforting beacon against the swirling snow. Anya pushed open the heavy oak door, the warmth of the fire within instantly welcoming her in. A familiar scent of peat smoke and chamomile tea hung in the air, easing the chill that had settled deep within her bones. She was home, at least for now, ready to face whatever this village threw at her next.
