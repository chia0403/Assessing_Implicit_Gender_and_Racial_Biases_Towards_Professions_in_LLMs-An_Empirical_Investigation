The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, shimmering above the dusty asphalt like a mirage. Sweat trickled down Thomas Jeremiah Blackwood's back as he wrestled with another length of roofing felt. He muttered curses under his breath, not out of frustration, but more out of habit. It was just another Tuesday on the roof for Tom, perched precariously between the world and the sky. 

Below him, the familiar cacophony of downtown Savannah buzzed – the screech of trolley cars, the clatter of construction, the murmur of conversations spilling from open doorways. But up here, amongst the shingles and nailers, there was only the rasp of Tom's saw and the distant whine of a cicada. He wiped his brow with a grimy rag, his calloused hands rough against his sun-baked skin. 

This particular job was on an old Victorian mansion, its ornate gables towering over him like watchful sentinels. The owner, a wealthy eccentric named Mrs. Van Derlyn, had insisted on the highest quality materials and Tom, with his years of experience and reputation for meticulous work, had been brought in to ensure the roof stood firm against another hurricane season. He wasn't complaining – good pay and interesting jobs were hard to come by in Savannah these days.  

Still, as he surveyed the vast expanse of tiles beneath him, a small part of Tom wished for a simpler life, one where the horizon was less a daunting ladder climb than a clear stretch of beach under a blazing summer sky. But then again, perhaps that's what made this job so captivating – the constant challenge, the sense of accomplishment in transforming something old and crumbling into something strong and enduring, just like himself.
