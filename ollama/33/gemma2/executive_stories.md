The humid Miami air hung heavy, thick with the scent of salt and sunscreen. A low drone of cicadas filled the languid afternoon as Eleanor Vance, CEO of Solara Energy, surveyed her beachfront office. The glass walls provided a panoramic view of turquoise waves crashing against the white sand, but Ellie couldn't bring herself to appreciate the spectacle. Her gaze was fixed on the spreadsheet glowing from her laptop, its stark black and white figures mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. 

Solara, once a beacon of green energy innovation, was teetering on the brink of collapse.  A recent scandal involving their flagship solar panel project had decimated investor confidence, leaving Ellie scrambling for a lifeline. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and purple, but for Ellie Vance, the only color she saw was red â€“ the color of her mounting financial losses.
