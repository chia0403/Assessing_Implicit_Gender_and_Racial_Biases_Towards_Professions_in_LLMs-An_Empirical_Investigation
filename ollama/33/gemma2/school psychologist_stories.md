The fluorescent lights hummed above Olivia Juniper Thorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the beige walls of the counseling room. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Elementary, but inside, it was perpetually twilight.  Olivia adjusted her glasses, the metal frames cold against her cheekbones, and glanced at the name on the clipboard: Ethan Hayes, 8 years old. She took a deep breath, trying to settle the flutter in her chest. This wasn't just another referral for behavioral issues – Ethan's case was different. It had an edge of mystery that had Olivia both intrigued and apprehensive.  


The door creaked open, letting in a sliver of sunlight and a boy who seemed swallowed whole by a navy blue hoodie. He hunched his shoulders, eyes fixed on the worn rug in front of him. A stray lock of brown hair fell over his forehead, obscuring a pair of eyes that flickered with a hidden intelligence – an intelligence that seemed to clash with his apparent shyness. Olivia smiled, hoping to coax him out of his shell.


"Hi Ethan," she said softly. "I'm Olivia Thorne. It's nice to meet you."  

The boy didn't respond, only shifted his weight and tightened his grip on the worn teddy bear clutched in his hands. 



Olivia knew this would be a long conversation. And judging by the way Ethan's gaze darted around the room, she had a feeling it was going to be anything but ordinary.
