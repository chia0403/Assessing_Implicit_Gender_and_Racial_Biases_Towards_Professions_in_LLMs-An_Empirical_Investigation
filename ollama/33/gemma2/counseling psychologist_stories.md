The air in Dr. Amelia Blackwood's office smelled faintly of lavender and chamomile, a scent she hoped was more calming than cloying. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the cityscape outside into an impressionistic watercolor. It wasn't unusual for clients to cancel appointments on days like this, opting for the comfort of their own homes, curled up with blankets and hot beverages. But Amelia hadnâ€™t had any cancellations today, not yet anyway.

Amelia leaned back in her leather armchair, her gaze falling on a half-finished crossword puzzle abandoned on her desk. It was supposed to be a way to unwind after her last session, but the jumbled letters seemed as indecipherable as the tangled emotions of her patients. Her gaze drifted towards the door, its brass handle gleaming under the warm lamplight. The next client, Mr. Davis, was due any minute, and Amelia could already feel the weight of his unspoken anxieties pressing down on her shoulders.
