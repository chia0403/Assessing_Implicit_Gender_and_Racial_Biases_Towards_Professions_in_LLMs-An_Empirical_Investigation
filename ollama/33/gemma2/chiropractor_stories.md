The humid Georgia air clung to Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a damp towel as she stepped out of her clinic. The sun, already heavy in the sky, cast long shadows across the manicured lawn of her family's Victorian home, where fragrant jasmine vines crawled over brick walls. The scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass mingled with the faint aroma of chlorine from the pool shimmering invitingly at the back of the yard.  

Amelia sighed, pressing a hand to her aching lower back. Another day, another stack of patients writhing in pain. She'd been treating the town of Magnolia for ten years now, but sometimes she longed for something more than adjusting spines and dispensing advice on posture. 


Today was particularly rough. A string of car accidents had flooded her waiting room with whiplash sufferers, leaving Amelia feeling like a human knot untangler.  She needed to unwind before tonight’s dinner with her parents – their anniversary celebration, naturally, centered around the meticulously curated rose garden she'd spent months tending. 

A sudden rustle from the oak tree beside the porch made her jump.  Her gaze landed on a bright yellow canary perched on a branch, its melodic song filling the humid afternoon air. It was a moment of pure tranquility in the midst of her day’s chaos. Maybe, just maybe, she could steal a few minutes before dinner to sit by the pool and let the sound of birdsong soothe her weary soul.
