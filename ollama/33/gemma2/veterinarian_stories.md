The salty tang of the sea breeze whipped Amelia "Amy" Everly's auburn hair across her face as she stepped out of the tiny clinic. The roar of the waves crashing against the jagged cliffs below was a constant lullaby in Seahaven, a seaside town where time moved at the pace of the tides.  She glanced up at the sky, already bruised with the promise of an approaching storm. A shiver ran down her spine, not from the cool air but from the unsettling feeling that something was amiss.

Amy had always felt most at home amidst the chaos of the clinic. The frantic barks, meows of distress, and chirps of worried birds were music to her ears. But today, an unnatural silence hung in the air. Even the seagulls seemed subdued, their usual raucous cries replaced by a low, mournful croaking.

Amy adjusted her stethoscope around her neck, the familiar weight comforting against the rising unease within her. Today was supposed to be like any other: treating Mrs. Peterson's arthritic terrier, Mr. Thompson's rambunctious tabby, and perhaps a few bewildered seagulls tangled in fishing lines. But something felt different, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that whispered of trouble brewing beneath Seahaven's tranquil facade.
