The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice "Bea" Juniper's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. Their buzzing echoed through her small office, a cramped space tucked away in the corner of a strip mall next to a laundromat and a discount sporting goods store. The scent of stale coffee mingled with the faint aroma of bleach, creating a unique olfactory experience Bea had come to associate with tax season.

Her desk was littered with crumpled receipts, W-2 forms, and half-empty coffee mugs. She squinted at the latest arrival – a woman named Mildred clutching a wad of paperclips and a nervous smile. 

"Tax deductions," Mildred whispered, her voice barely audible above the fluorescent hum. "That's what they all talk about." 


Bea sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped its confines. This was the life she'd chosen – sifting through financial records, deciphering IRS jargon, and untangling the tangled web of deductions and credits. She wasn't particularly passionate about it, but it paid the bills, kept the lights on, and occasionally offered a glimpse into the peculiar lives of her clients.
