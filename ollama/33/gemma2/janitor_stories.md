The stale air hung heavy in the halls of Blackwood Academy, thick with the scent of old books and forgotten dreams.  Rain lashed against the arched windows, each drop a tiny hammer on the ancient stone. Bartholomew "Bart" Quillfeather, custodian extraordinaire, sighed as he pushed his mop across the polished floor of the grand library. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic swish of his mop and the occasional creak of the building settling into its centuries-old bones. He could almost hear the ghosts whispering amongst the towering shelves, their voices lost in the rustle of parchment and the sigh of forgotten winds. 

Bart wasn't scared of ghosts, not really. Heâ€™d grown up with stories of Blackwood Academy's spectral residents, tales spun by his grandmother who had once been a librarian here. It was just...sometimes, at night, when the wind howled like a hungry wolf and the rain drummed a mournful rhythm on the roof, he felt their presence more keenly. A chill down his spine, a flicker of movement in the shadows, a whisper of cold air that carried with it the scent of old lavender and parchment. 


Tonight, however, the only company Bart had was a stray book left abandoned on one of the library tables, its pages fluttering ominously in the draft. He picked it up gingerly, feeling the rough texture of the leather cover beneath his fingertips. The title, etched in faded gold, sent a shiver down his spine: "The Book of Shadows and Secrets."
