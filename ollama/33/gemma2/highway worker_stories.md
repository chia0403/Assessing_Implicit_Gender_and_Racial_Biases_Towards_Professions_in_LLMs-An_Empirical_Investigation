The sun, an angry orange eye peering through the smog-choked sky, beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's back. Sweat stung his eyes as he wielded the jackhammer, its relentless rhythm a dull throb against the cacophony of construction around him.  

Eli wiped his brow with a sleeve already soaked through, squinting at the ribbon of asphalt snaking before him like a wounded serpent. The I-95 corridor, lifeline of the East Coast, was undergoing its biannual resurrection - patched, scraped, and repaved to withstand another year's worth of relentless traffic.  

Eli stood on a stretch near Baltimore, where the highway dipped and swayed through a landscape scarred by industry. Towering steel skeletons of abandoned factories loomed like skeletal sentinels against the bruised sky, their rusted bones whispering forgotten stories of boom and bust. 


Beyond the construction zone, the city sprawled, a labyrinth of concrete and glass that pulsed with a restless energy Eli felt in his bones, but never dared to join. He was content with his patch of dirt and asphalt, a small island of solitude amidst the urban chaos.
