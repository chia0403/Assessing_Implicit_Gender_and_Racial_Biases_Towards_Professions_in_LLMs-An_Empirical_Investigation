The clinking of cocktail glasses and the muffled murmur of conversation hung thick in the air like cigarette smoke, though the establishment had gone entirely smoke-free five years ago.  Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, or Amy as she preferred, navigated the crowded floor of The Brass Lantern with practiced grace. Her name tag, a chipped piece of plastic pinned to her forest green apron, read "Amy - Your Stellar Server," and she aimed to live up to it. 

The Brass Lantern was a relic from a bygone era, a dimly lit jazz bar tucked away in the forgotten corner of an alley behind the city's bustling theater district. Red velvet curtains draped heavy doorways, casting long shadows on the sticky floorboards that had seen countless spilled drinks and whispered secrets. The air hummed with the low melody of a saxophone solo, weaving its way through the aroma of aged whiskey and desperation.  


Amy paused at a corner table where two men huddled over a worn deck of cards, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of a single candle. They looked up as she approached, their eyes wary. 

"Can I get you gentlemen anything?" Amy asked, her voice smooth and professional despite the prickling tension in the air.
