The early morning mist clung to Juniper’s boots like a damp shroud as she surveyed the expanse of emerald green before her. Sunlight, still shy and hesitant, peeked through the towering Douglas firs that blanketed the slopes of Mount Sentinel. 

Juniper Blackwood adjusted the straps of her backpack, the weight of her chainsaw and gear settling comfortably against her spine. The scent of pine needles and damp earth filled her lungs, a familiar comfort she wouldn’t trade for anything. This forest, this mountain, was her home, its rhythm pulsing in her blood. Today, however, the usual symphony of birdsong and rustling leaves carried an undercurrent of unease. Rumors had been swirling through the logging camps about encroaching development, whispers of bulldozers swallowing swaths of ancient timber. 

Juniper tightened her grip on her favorite axe, its well-worn handle familiar beneath her calloused hand. Fear gnawed at her, a cold knot in her gut, but she refused to let it paralyze her. She was Juniper Blackwood, daughter of the mountain, and she would fight for what was hers.
