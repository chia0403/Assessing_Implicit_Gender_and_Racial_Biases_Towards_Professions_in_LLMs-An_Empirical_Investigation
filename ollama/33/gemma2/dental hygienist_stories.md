The antiseptic scent of mint hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang that always seemed to permeate Dr. Ramirez's office.  Sunlight slanted through the blinds, casting long shadows across the waiting room where Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Carter sat, meticulously organizing her tray of instruments. Each scaler, each probe, was placed with a precision born from years of practice, a quiet ritual before the storm of pearly whites that would soon be unleashed upon her.

Her workday at Ramirez Family Dentistry always began the same way: a wave of anxious patients shuffling through the door, their smiles hesitant, their eyes darting between the brightly coloured children's books lining the shelves and the gleaming stainless steel instruments on display.  Amy knew how to soothe those anxieties. A gentle touch, a reassuring smile, and an expert eye that could identify even the subtlest sign of plaque – she was a maestro of oral hygiene, wielding her instruments with the grace of a surgeon.

Amy glanced at Dr. Ramirez’s calendar, a sense of unease settling in her stomach.  He had scheduled six appointments for the morning, each one with a name she didn't recognize. 


The fluorescent lights hummed overhead as Amy straightened her blue scrubs and prepared for another day on the front lines of dental warfare. But this time, the battleground felt strangely unfamiliar, the enemy unseen.
