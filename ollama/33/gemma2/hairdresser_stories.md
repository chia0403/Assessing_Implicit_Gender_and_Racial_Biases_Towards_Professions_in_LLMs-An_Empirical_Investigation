The scent of lavender shampoo and vanilla conditioner hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Everly’s thick auburn braid as she carefully sectioned Mrs. Henderson's hair. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of "Amelia's Adorned," illuminating the rainbow of hair dye bottles lining the shelves. Outside, the bustling streets of Charleston hummed with a lazy Saturday afternoon energy. But inside the small salon, time seemed to stand still. The whirring of the hairdryer was the soundtrack to Amelia’s life, each snip of her shears a symphony of transformation. 

Amelia's Adorned wasn't just a place for haircuts; it was a haven, a space where secrets were shared over shoulder-length bobs and dreams whispered during deep conditioning treatments. It was Amelia's sanctuary, a world away from the chaos that often consumed Charleston's heart. But today, something felt different.  


The air crackled with an unfamiliar tension, like a storm brewing on the horizon. And Amelia knew, with the instinctive certainty of someone who spent their days deciphering unspoken emotions, that this wasn't just another ordinary Saturday afternoon in her little salon.
