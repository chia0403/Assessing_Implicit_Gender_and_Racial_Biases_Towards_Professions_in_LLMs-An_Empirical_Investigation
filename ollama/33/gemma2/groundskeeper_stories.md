The morning mist clung to Bartholomew “Barty” Thistlewick like a damp shroud as he pushed his rusty mower across the dew-laden lawn. Barty knew every blade of grass in the sprawling estate of Oakhaven Manor by heart: the stubborn dandelions that insisted on poking through the meticulously trimmed borders, the patches where squirrels had unearthed buried treasures (or perhaps just forgotten nuts), and the lone oak tree at the crest of the hill, its branches stretching out like gnarled fingers. 

Barty wasn't just a groundskeeper; he was Oakhaven Manor's silent guardian, a custodian of its sprawling beauty for nearly forty years.  The manor itself, a majestic Victorian mansion with turrets that kissed the clouds, had witnessed generations of history unfold within its hallowed walls. But for Barty, the real magic resided in the quiet rituals of his work: the rhythmic whir of the mower, the earthy scent of freshly turned soil, and the gentle rustling of leaves whispering secrets to the wind. 


Today, however, a sense of unease stirred in Barty's usually tranquil soul. The air felt charged with an unfamiliar energy, and a flock of ravens circled above Oakhaven Manor, their harsh caws echoing through the stillness like pronouncements of doom. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to change, something momentous, and perhaps unsettlingly, out of his control.
