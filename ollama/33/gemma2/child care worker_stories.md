The scent of peanut butter and jelly hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint aroma of crayons and disinfectant. The chaotic symphony of tiny voices - squeals of delight, frustrated whimpers, the rhythmic clinking of plastic cups - filled Ms. Eleanor Amelia Finch's ears like a comforting lullaby.  Her small world was "Sunshine Corner," a bustling daycare nestled in a quiet suburb, where she nurtured little minds and hearts five days a week. 

Eleanor surveyed the scene with a smile: three-year-olds were engaged in a spirited game of building blocks, toddlers clung to their teddy bears as they shuffled around the playroom, and a gaggle of four-year-olds huddled around a table, eyes glued to a storybook she'd just finished reading. It was a typical Tuesday morning at Sunshine Corner, filled with the endearing chaos that Eleanor wouldn't trade for anything in the world. 


Until, that is, the phone rang.
