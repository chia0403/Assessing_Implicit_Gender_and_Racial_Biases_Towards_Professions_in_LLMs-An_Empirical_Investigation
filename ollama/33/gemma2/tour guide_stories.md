The midday sun beat down on Eleanor Anya Petrova's neck as she gestured towards the crumbling facade of the Tsar Nicholas II Palace. Sweat beaded on her brow, dampening the carefully applied rouge that did little to mask her exhaustion. 

"And this," she declared in a voice slightly hoarse from hours of droning history lessons, "is where the infamous 'Winter Ball' took place, just weeks before the revolution swept through Russia!" A small gaggle of tourists shuffled closer, their faces reflecting a mixture of boredom and mild fascination. Eleanor could practically see their minds wandering - to air-conditioned cafes, souvenir shops, anything but this sweltering, sun-drenched ruin.

The palace itself was a monument to forgotten grandeur, its once pristine white walls now faded and pockmarked with years of neglect. Vines crept up the cracked stonework like tenacious emerald serpents, while pigeons cooed nonchalantly from crumbling balustrades.  The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and decay, punctuated by the faint whiff of chlorine from the nearby public pool - a jarring reminder that even in this historical wasteland, life went on.

This wasn't how Eleanor had envisioned her summer. A history graduate from Moscow University, she had dreamt of working at the Imperial Archives, surrounded by dusty tomes and forgotten secrets. Instead, she was stuck here, hawking tourist trinkets and reciting well-worn narratives to indifferent crowds.  But rent in Moscow wasn't cheap, and a tour guide job provided just enough to keep her afloat. At least, that's what she kept telling herself as another group of tourists shuffled past, their cameras clicking away like clockwork.
