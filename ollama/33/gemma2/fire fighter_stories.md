The air hung thick with smoke and the smell of burnt timber. Amelia "Amy" Blackwood wiped the sweat from her brow, the heat radiating off the burning building like an angry sun.  Flames licked at the roof, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the brick facade. A wall of inferno roared behind her, a hungry beast devouring everything in its path. It was 3:17 AM, and Amy was already knee-deep in the worst fire she'd seen since joining Station 28 five years ago.

The old warehouse district, with its cobblestone streets and aging brick buildings, usually hummed with life after dark â€“ a haven for late-night artists, antique collectors, and whispered secrets. Tonight, it was a canvas of chaos, the flames painting streaks of crimson and orange against the inky black sky. Sirens wailed in the distance, their mournful cries echoing off the crumbling walls, a chorus of desperation amidst the crackling inferno. 


Amy took a deep breath, her lungs burning with each inhale. The air tasted acrid, a metallic tang that lingered like death itself. She adjusted the mask over her face, the cool rubber against her skin a small comfort in this sea of fire. It was time to get to work.
