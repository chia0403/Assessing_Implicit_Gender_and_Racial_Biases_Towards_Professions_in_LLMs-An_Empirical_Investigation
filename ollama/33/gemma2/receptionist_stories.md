The aroma of burnt coffee and stale printer ink hung heavy in the air of Dr. Albright’s office, as thick and suffocating as the silence that usually punctuated Amelia Beatrice Prescott's workday.  

Amelia sat hunched over her desk, meticulously alphabetizing the stack of patient intake forms on her left while ignoring the rhythmic click-clacking of Dr. Albright's typing from his inner sanctum. It was a Tuesday morning in late autumn, and the only sound breaking the office monotony was the rustling of dry leaves outside the window, hinting at the approaching winter chill. 

Outside, a streetcar rattled down Elm Street, carrying its passengers through the sleepy town of Havenwood, a place where time seemed to move slower than the city folk Amelia had left behind years ago.  Here, even gossip travelled at snail's pace, and the biggest news was usually Mrs. Henderson’s prize-winning pumpkin at the annual fair.  

Amelia, however, craved something more. A little excitement, a sprinkle of intrigue, perhaps even a dash of danger – anything to break the monotony of her receptionist existence. But for now, all she had were forms, files, and the faint hope that one day, Havenwood would surprise her.
