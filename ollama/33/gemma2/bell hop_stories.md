The humid Georgia air hung heavy over the lobby of the Grand Magnolia Hotel, clinging to Bartholomew "Bart" Butterfield like a damp towel. He adjusted the red velvet jacket that strained against his lanky frame, slick with sweat despite the cool tiles beneath his worn loafers.  

Bart was a bellhop in the truest sense: dedicated, nimble, and always ready with a smile, even when dealing with the haughty hotel guests who seemed to believe their own importance surpassed the very stars themselves. He knew every inch of this opulent establishment, from the creaky floorboards in the antique wing to the hidden service stairwell that smelled faintly of lavender soap and forgotten dreams. Today, though, something felt different.  

The normally bustling lobby buzzed with an uneasy silence. The air, thick with anticipation, crackled like a storm brewing just beyond the French doors leading onto the veranda overlooking Savannah's cobbled streets. Even the polished brass chandeliers seemed to dim their golden glow, casting long, menacing shadows across the plush carpets.  

Bart wasn't sure what was causing this shift in atmosphere, but he knew, with a bone-deep certainty, that something big was about to happen.
