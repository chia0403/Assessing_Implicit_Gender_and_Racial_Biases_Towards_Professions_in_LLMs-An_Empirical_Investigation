The sterile white walls of St. Jude's Hospital seemed to press in on Dr. Elara Vance as she scrubbed her hands, the rhythmic rasp of the surgical scrub brush echoing through the otherwise hushed pre-op room. A symphony of beeps and whirs emanated from the equipment banked against one wall, a constant reminder of the precarious lives teetering on the edge in this place.  

The faint scent of antiseptic battled with the lingering aroma of burnt coffee - a familiar combination that had become synonymous with Elara's life since she began her residency three years ago. She glanced at the clock above the sink, its red digits flashing 4:57 AM. A knot tightened in her stomach. Another long night ahead.  

Elara wasn't born for this kind of tireless dedication. Her heart yearned for quiet sun-drenched mornings, the scent of freshly baked bread, and the gentle strumming of a guitar - a far cry from the cacophony of the hospital ward. But somewhere between the endless rounds, the blood pressure readings, and the hushed conversations about hope and fear, she'd found herself captivated by the fragility and resilience of human life. 


This case, however, felt different. A young boy, barely ten years old, lay waiting on the other side of that door. His name was Liam, and he carried with him a weight far too heavy for his small frame. The surgery they were about to perform could save him, or it could be his final curtain call.
