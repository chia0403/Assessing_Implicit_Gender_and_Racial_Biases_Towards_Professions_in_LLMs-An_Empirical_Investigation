The air in Sugar & Spice was thick with the scent of vanilla, almond, and a hint of something cinnamon-y that Eleanor Amelia Buttercup swore she’d never encountered before.  

Eleanor, known to most as Ellie, hummed along to the cheesy pop song blasting from the shop radio, her nimble fingers expertly frosting a towering three-tiered wedding cake. The bride had requested "rustic elegance" – buttercream swirls mimicking vines, delicate sugar flowers clinging to the sides, and a cascading waterfall of berries that looked almost good enough to eat (almost). 

Her small bakery was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a sleepy town nestled between rolling hills and a glistening lake.  It wasn't exactly bustling with activity, but Ellie wouldn't trade it for anything. She loved the quiet rhythm of her life – waking up before dawn, kneading dough, the warmth of the oven, the clink of sugar against glass as she measured out ingredients, the soft chatter of regulars stopping in for their morning coffee and a slice of Ellie’s famous blueberry pie.  It was a good life, simple and sweet.

But today, something felt different. A new energy crackled beneath the familiar humdrum. It started with a strange aroma, like burnt sugar mixed with… pine needles? Then came a string of unusual orders – a cake shaped like a dragon, another resembling a giant sunflower, and then this one, with its elusive cinnamon scent and impossible requests. 


Whatever it was, Ellie knew Oakhaven was about to get a whole lot sweeter - and perhaps, just a little bit wilder.
