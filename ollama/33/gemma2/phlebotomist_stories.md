The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glare over the rows of chairs in the waiting room. A faint, antiseptic smell hung in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic beep of an automated blood pressure monitor. 

Eleanor, her nametag pinned neatly to her blue scrubs, adjusted the small plastic tourniquet in her gloved hand. Her eyes scanned the faces in the waiting area – a mix of apprehension and bored resignation. She had seen it all before: the teenagers clutching their phones, pretending disinterest; the elderly couples clinging to each other for comfort; the mothers trying to distract their screaming toddlers with colourful distractions.

Her gaze landed on a young woman, no older than 25, who fidgeted nervously in her seat. Her hands were clammy, and she kept glancing at her watch as if it held some vital clue to escaping the waiting room's purgatory. Eleanor knew that look – the fear of needles masked by an outward calm.  It was a familiar dance she performed with patients every day, coaxing them through their anxieties, transforming fear into fleeting discomfort. 

Eleanor approached the woman with a gentle smile. "Sarah Jones? It's time for your blood draw."
