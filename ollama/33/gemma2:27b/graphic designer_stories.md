The incessant whirring of the cooling fan on Emilia Brighton's laptop was starting to sound like a swarm of angry bees trapped in her skull.  She rubbed her temples, trying to massage away the tension building behind her eyes. Her tiny studio apartment, crammed with design books, overflowing sketchbooks, and enough empty coffee cups to stage a miniature caffeine wasteland, seemed to be closing in on her.

The deadline for the "Save Our Sharks" campaign was looming like a hungry great white, and Emilia felt hopelessly adrift.  Her usual creative spark had fizzled out, replaced by a dull ache of frustration. She stared at the screen, where the shark mascot she'd been wrestling with looked less like an apex predator and more like a dejected goldfish.

Maybe a walk would help, Emilia thought, pushing back her chair. The salty air of Brighton Beach, just a few blocks away, always had a way of clearing her head.  Besides, she needed a break from the oppressive silence of her apartment, a silence broken only by the relentless buzzing of her laptop and the occasional exasperated sigh escaping her lips.  

Stepping out into the bustling Brooklyn afternoon, Emilia hoped for inspiration to strike as suddenly and fiercely as a rogue wave crashing onto the shore.
