The scent of caramelized sugar clung to Elara Blackwood like a second skin. It permeated her clothes, her hair, even her dreams. Her bakery, "Sweet Surrender," nestled in a cobbled corner of Edinburgh's Old Town, was a haven for the senses.

Elara hummed along to a Scottish folk song playing softly on the radio, her hands expertly kneading dough that pulsed beneath them like a living thing.
