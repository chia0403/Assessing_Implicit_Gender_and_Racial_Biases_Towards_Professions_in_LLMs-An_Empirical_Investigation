The frigid wind clawed at Elias Thorne's face as he surveyed the desolate landscape stretching before him. Jagged peaks pierced the bruised sky, their snow-capped summits shrouded in swirling mists. Below, the obsidian walls of Fort Obsidian rose like a defiant fist against the unforgiving wilderness. Built into the side of a sheer cliff, its black stones seemed to absorb the meager sunlight, leaving the fortress perpetually cloaked in shadow. Elias, bundled in his thick woolen coat and fur-lined hat, shivered despite the layers.

He'd been stationed at Fort Obsidian for five years, ever since he was discharged from the King's Guard after a grievous injury left him with a limp that slowed his step but sharpened his senses. The isolation of this remote outpost suited him. Here, among the howling winds and craggy peaks, he found solace. His duty was simple: guard the ancient obsidian gate, rumored to hold secrets older than time itself.

Today, however, Elias felt a prickle of unease. The wind carried an unfamiliar scent - something acrid and metallic, tinged with fear. He tightened his grip on his spear, its polished iron head glinting in the faint light filtering through the storm clouds. Something was amiss.
