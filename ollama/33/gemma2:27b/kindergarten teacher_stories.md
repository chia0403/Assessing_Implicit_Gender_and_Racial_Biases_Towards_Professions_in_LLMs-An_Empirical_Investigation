The aroma of crayons and Elmer's glue hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of disinfectant that perpetually clung to Ms. Evelyn Rosalie Finchâ€™s classroom. Sunlight streamed through the large windows overlooking the vibrant playground, illuminating dust motes dancing in the beam.  Evelyn sighed contentedly, her gaze sweeping over the colorful alphabet chart hanging above the whiteboard, the tiny hand-painted murals adorning the walls, and the meticulously organized cubbies filled with brightly colored backpacks. 

It was a new school year, and Evelyn's heart thrummed with anticipation. Kindergarten, she believed, was where the magic of learning truly began.
