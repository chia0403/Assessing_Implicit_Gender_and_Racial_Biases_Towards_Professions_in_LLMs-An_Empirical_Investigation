The rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Amelia "Amy" Harding's office, mimicking the insistent pounding in her head. The neon sign outside flickered, casting grotesque shadows on the peeling floral wallpaper that lined her cramped space. It read "Harding Investigations," the 'g' dangling precariously by a single wire, threatening to join its brethren in a graveyard of burnt-out bulbs. Amy herself felt like she was teetering on the edge of burnout. Three days without sleep, fuelled by lukewarm coffee and stale donuts, had left her feeling frayed at the edges.  

The insistent buzz of her landline dragged her from her thoughts. She snatched it up, her voice gravelly with exhaustion. "Harding Investigations," she rasped, already bracing herself for another deadbeat dad or a cheating spouse case. But the voice on the other end was different â€“ hushed, urgent, and tinged with an accent Amy couldn't quite place. 

"Miss Harding? They say you're the best..." The line crackled, and the voice faded into static before abruptly cutting out.  Amy stared at the receiver, a shiver running down her spine despite the humid air. This wasn't a routine case. There was something else in that voice, a desperation that whispered of secrets and danger.
