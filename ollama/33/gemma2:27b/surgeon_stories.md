Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Evelyn Albright. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unnerving blue tinge over the sterile operating room. Evelyn scrubbed her hands raw, the antiseptic scent doing little to quell the knot of anxiety in her stomach.  

Tonight was different. Tonight wasn't a routine appendectomy or a gall bladder removal. Tonight, she was facing the biggest challenge of her career: separating conjoined twins, Liam and Ethan Riley. The boys, barely six years old, lay prepped on the operating table, their tiny chests rising and falling in unison. Evelyn knew the risks were immense; one wrong move could cost them both their lives. 


As she draped herself in sterile gown and gloves, a wave of doubt washed over her. Could she truly do this? Could she separate two souls who had shared every breath, every laugh, every tear for six precious years? The weight of the decision pressed down on her, heavy as lead. Evelyn took a deep breath, steeling her resolve. This was why she became a surgeon â€“ to heal, to save, to defy the impossible.

Let the surgery begin.
