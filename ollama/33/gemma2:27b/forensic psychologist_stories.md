Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's chest. The harsh fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unsettling pallor on the man sitting opposite her â€“ Daniel Croft, accused of a brutal double homicide.

Evelyn adjusted her spectacles, the weight of their gold frame familiar against her temple. She wasn't easily rattled, years spent delving into the darkest recesses of the human psyche had hardened her to most things. Yet, there was something about Croft's unsettling stillness, his vacant blue eyes staring through her rather than at her, that set her nerves on edge.

The air hung thick with tension, punctuated only by the rhythmic tapping of Detective Miller's pen against the table and the occasional guttural cough from Croft himself. Evelyn leaned forward, her voice calm but measured. "Daniel, I understand this is a difficult time, but we need your cooperation to understand what happened."
