Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the cluttered desk piled high with student files. Outside, the playground of Oakhaven Elementary was deserted, swings swaying mournfully in the wind. It was a Wednesday afternoon, and usually this time would be filled with the excited chatter of children returning from recess. Today, however, the only sound was the insistent patter of rain and the distant rumble of thunder.

Eleanor sighed, her gaze drifting to the framed photograph on her desk â€“ a smiling young girl with bright, curious eyes holding up a hand-drawn picture. Sarah. The case that had been haunting Eleanor for weeks. A seemingly happy child, excelling in school, suddenly withdrawn and plagued by nightmares.  Something wasn't right, and Eleanor felt a gnawing sense of urgency to uncover the truth.

The door creaked open, breaking Eleanor from her thoughts. A young boy with nervous eyes stood hesitantly in the doorway, clutching a well-worn stuffed bear.
