The Arizona sun hammered down on Bartholomew "Bart" Kincaid's shoulders, turning his work shirt into a furnace against his skin. Sweat stung his eyes as he surveyed the endless stretch of blacktop rippling in the heat haze. He squinted towards the distant horizon where mountains clawed at the sky, their peaks dusted with snow that seemed impossibly cold against the scorching desert air.

Bart wasn't built for this kind of weather. His stocky frame, better suited for shoveling coal than mending asphalt, ached under the relentless sun. Still, he was grateful for the work. Highway maintenance didn't pay much, but it kept a roof over his head and food on the table – necessities that felt increasingly precious in these uncertain times.

Today, Bart and his crew were patching potholes along a desolate stretch of Route 66, the legendary highway now mostly forgotten by travelers who favored the air-conditioned comfort of interstate highways.  But for Bart, it held a certain charm, a melancholic echo of a bygone era when people traveled slower, stopped to take in the scenery, and shared stories with strangers over steaming cups of coffee at roadside diners.

He tapped his crowbar against the cracked asphalt, the sound sharp and lonely in the vast silence. As he prepared to dig out the crumbling pavement, a glint of metal caught his eye. Nestled amongst the jagged rocks beside the road was something that didn't belong – a battered leather briefcase, its clasps rusted shut. Curiosity piqued, Bart knelt down, wiping away the desert dust to reveal an embossed emblem on the side: a stylized sunburst with the inscription "Phoenix Institute."
