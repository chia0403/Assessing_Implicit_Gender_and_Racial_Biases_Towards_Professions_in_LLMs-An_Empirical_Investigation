The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn linoleum floor of the St. Jude's Community Clinic waiting room. It was a Tuesday morning, and the air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and nervous anticipation. Elara adjusted her butterfly clip, a splash of turquoise against her stark white scrubs, and sighed. Tuesdays were always the busiest. 

She glanced at the clock – 8:02 am. Two minutes past opening, and already a queue snaked its way across the cramped space, filled with faces etched with worry and weariness. A young boy clutched his mother's hand, hiding behind her skirt. An elderly woman coughed into a tissue, her eyes watery. Elara felt a familiar pang of empathy – she knew what it meant to be vulnerable, to trust a stranger with your blood.
