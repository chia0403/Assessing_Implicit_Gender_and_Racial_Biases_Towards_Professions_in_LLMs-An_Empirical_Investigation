Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously above her door. The rhythmic drumming was almost hypnotic, mirroring the tension throbbing in Evelynâ€™s temples.  She was starting to regret opening her practice in this dreary corner of Seattle, where even the sun seemed reluctant to shine.

Her phone buzzed with another appointment cancellation, the fourth today. Evelyn sighed, massaging a knot that had formed between her shoulder blades. She'd chosen this career because she loved helping people, easing their aches and pains, aligning them both physically and metaphorically. But lately, it felt like Seattle itself was conspiring against her success, shrouding her practice in perpetual gloom.

Just as she considered packing up early, the door creaked open. A gust of wind followed a tall figure, silhouetted against the stormy grey sky. Evelyn squinted, surprised. She hadn't expected anyone in this weather. The figure stepped inside, shaking droplets from a long, dark coat.
