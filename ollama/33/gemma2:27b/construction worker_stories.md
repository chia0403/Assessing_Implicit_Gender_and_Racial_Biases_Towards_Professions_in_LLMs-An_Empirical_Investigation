The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Ramirez's neck, turning the sweat under his hardhat into a simmering cauldron. The air hung thick with the smell of dust, diesel, and freshly cut lumber - the perfume of progress, Eli liked to think. He squinted up at the skeletal framework of the new high-rise, its steel beams reaching for the hazy sky like grasping fingers. This was his domain, this symphony of clanging metal and roaring machinery. For five years, Eli had been a part of this world, his calloused hands building dreams one brick, one beam at a time.

Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in Eli's gut. The blueprints called for a specific support beam to be installed on the tenth floor, but when he checked the delivery manifest, it was missing. 


Eli wiped the sweat from his brow and muttered under his breath. This wasn't good. Delays meant money lost, and everyone knew Mr. Vargas, the foreman, had a temper hotter than the asphalt they poured in summer. He needed to find that beam, and fast.
