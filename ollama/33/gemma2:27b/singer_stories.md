The air in the Blue Moon Tavern hung thick with cigarette smoke and spilled beer, clinging to Elara Nightingaleâ€™s crimson dress like a second skin. Her voice, usually a clear bell ringing through concert halls, felt muffled tonight, drowned out by the raucous laughter and drunken singalongs. It was Tuesday, amateur night at the Blue Moon, and while Elara wasn't an amateur, desperation had driven her to this dimly lit dive bar nestled in the heart of New Orleans. 

Three months ago, her record label had dropped her, citing "lackluster sales" and a "shifting market."  Elara, once hailed as the next big thing in soul music, was now struggling to make rent. The Blue Moon wasn't exactly the stage she'd envisioned for herself, but it paid in cash, no questions asked. Tonight, she just needed enough to keep the lights on.
