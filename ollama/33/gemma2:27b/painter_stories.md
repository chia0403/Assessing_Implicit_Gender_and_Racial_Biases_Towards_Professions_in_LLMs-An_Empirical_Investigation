The humid air clung to Elara Bellwether like a second skin as she trudged up the cobblestone path. Sunlight glinted off the turquoise rooftops of Santorini, the whitewashed walls blindingly bright against the cerulean sky. The scent of bougainvillea and salt spray hung heavy in the air, a heady perfume that Elara usually found intoxicating. Today, however, it did little to lift her spirits.

Her easel, laden with brushes and tubes of paint, bumped against her leg with every step. It felt like an unwelcome burden, mirroring the weight pressing down on her soul. She had come to Santorini seeking inspiration, a muse to pull her from the creative abyss she'd been spiralling in for months. But so far, all she'd found were postcard-perfect views and a gnawing sense of emptiness.
