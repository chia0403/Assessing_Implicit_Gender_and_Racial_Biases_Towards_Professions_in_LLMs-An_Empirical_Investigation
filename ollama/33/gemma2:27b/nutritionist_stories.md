Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the already fading autumn colours outside. Inside, Emilia Cartwright, a nutritionist with eyes the colour of warm honey and a smile as bright as the sunflower seeds she sprinkled on her salads, sighed. Another cancelled appointment. This was the third one this week. 

Emilia wasn't sure what was going on.

But lately, it felt like everyone had suddenly lost interest in healthy eating. The empty chairs across from her desk seemed to mock her with their silence.
