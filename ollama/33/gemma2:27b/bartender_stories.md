The dim amber glow of the "Last Call" tavern spilled onto the rain-slicked cobblestones, its warmth barely reaching past the doorway. Inside, a haze of pipe smoke hung low, punctuated by the rhythmic clinking of glasses and the murmur of hushed conversations. Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling, his face weathered like an old leather boot, stood behind the mahogany bar, polishing a snifter with practiced ease. His silver hair was tied back in a loose bun, revealing sharp cheekbones and eyes that seemed to hold centuries of stories. 

Tonight, though, Bart wasn't interested in tales. He was focused on the task at hand: crafting the perfect Old Fashioned for the woman seated at the far end of the bar, her face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. The air around her crackled with an unsettling energy, like static before a storm. Bart knew better than to pry into his patrons' business, but something about this woman sparked a flicker of unease in his gut.

He slid the perfectly crafted cocktail towards her, ice clinking softly against the crystal glass. "Anything else I can get you?" he asked, his voice gruff yet surprisingly gentle. The woman tilted her head back, revealing piercing emerald eyes and a thin scar running along her jawline. A wry smile played on her lips as she met Bart's gaze.

"Just the truth, bartender," she said, her voice smooth as velvet. "And perhaps a story or two."
