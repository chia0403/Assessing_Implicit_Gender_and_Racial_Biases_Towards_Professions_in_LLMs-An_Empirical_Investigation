The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Eliza Mae "Liza" Davenport like a second skin as she surveyed her team. They stood on the dusty field under the unforgiving glare of the Texas sun, sweat already beading on their brows even though practice hadn't officially begun. Liza, in her faded maroon coaching shirt and well-worn baseball cap, knew this heat was going to be a beast today.

This was Liza's first year coaching the Hawks, the ragtag underdog team from the dusty town of Harmony Creek. Their uniforms were mismatched hand-me-downs, their field resembled more of a cow pasture than a sporting ground, and they hadn't won a game in three seasons. But Liza saw something in them â€“ a spark, a hunger for victory that lay dormant beneath years of disappointment. 

Today, she was determined to ignite it.
