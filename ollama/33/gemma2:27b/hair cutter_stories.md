The air hung thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and hairspray, punctuated by the sharp tang of bleach. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of "Curl Up & Dye," illuminating motes dancing in its path. Eloise Marchand, her auburn braid swinging down her back, surveyed her domain with a critical eye.  She adjusted a wonky framed photograph of Audrey Hepburn, straightened a stack of Vogue magazines, and mentally reviewed her schedule for the day. It was going to be a long one. Mrs. Higgins was coming in for her weekly perm, young Liam needed his first haircut (potentially traumatic, Eloise mused), and then there was the mysterious new client scheduled for 3 pm â€“ simply "A. Sterling" in her appointment book.  Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that this appointment would be anything but ordinary.
