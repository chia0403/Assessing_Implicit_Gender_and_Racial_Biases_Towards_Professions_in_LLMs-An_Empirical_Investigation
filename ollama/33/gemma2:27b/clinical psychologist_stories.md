The incessant drip from the leaky faucet in Dr. Rosalind Eldridge's office was starting to sound like a metronome counting down to madness. It punctuated the silence between each patient, a relentless reminder of the simmering tension beneath her calm exterior.

Rosalind sat perched on the edge of her plush armchair, fiddling with a silver pen engraved with "Columbia University - Doctoral Candidate." The office, nestled in a converted brownstone on a quiet street in Greenwich Village, was meticulously curated: warm ochre walls, overflowing bookshelves, and a large window overlooking a tangle of autumn leaves. Yet, despite the inviting ambiance, Rosalind felt the familiar weight of unease settle upon her shoulders. Today's patient was unlike any she had encountered before - a woman shrouded in secrets, whose unsettling gaze seemed to pierce through Rosalind's carefully constructed fa√ßade.
