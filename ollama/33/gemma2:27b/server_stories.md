The greasy air hung thick in The Rusty Spigot, smelling of stale beer, fried onions, and desperation. Esmeralda "Esme" Vargas navigated the crowded tables with practiced ease, her worn black flats whispering against the sticky linoleum floor. The usual Friday night chaos reigned: drunken businessmen slurring orders, college students guffawing over pitchers of cheap beer, and couples slumped in booths, their faces illuminated by the flickering glow of the television mounted above the bar.  Esme expertly balanced a tray laden with burgers, fries, and steaming plates of mozzarella sticks, her dark eyes scanning the room for her next target. 


Tonight was double shift night, which meant Esme would be here until well past midnight, earning every penny she could to cover rent and keep a roof over her head. It wasn't glamorous work, but it paid the bills and kept her afloat. Besides, there was a certain rhythm to the chaos, a comforting predictability in the endless cycle of orders, refills, and complaints.
