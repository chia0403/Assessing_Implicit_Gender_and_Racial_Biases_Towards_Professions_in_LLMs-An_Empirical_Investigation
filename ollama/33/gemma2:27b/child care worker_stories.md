The aroma of banana pancakes hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of disinfectant that clung perpetually to the walls of Sunnyside Daycare. Emilia Rose Cartwright hummed along to the tinny radio playing children's songs as she flipped a perfectly golden pancake onto a plate. Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on the playground, promising another sweltering day in Harmony Springs, Missouri.

Emilia loved her job. It wasn't always easy – dealing with tantrums, spilled juice boxes, and the occasional mysterious crayon masterpiece on the wall – but seeing the joy and wonder in the children’s eyes made it all worthwhile. Today, however, a nervous flutter danced in her stomach.  It was "Bring Your Grown-Up to School Day," and Emilia had invited her grandmother, Nana Rose, who'd been struggling with loneliness ever since Emilia’s grandfather passed away last year. 

Nana Rose was the kindest, sweetest woman Emilia knew, but she was also a bit… eccentric. Emilia hoped the other parents wouldn't mind her quirky stories about talking squirrels and her uncanny ability to predict rainstorms. But most of all, Emilia hoped Nana Rose would feel welcome and loved among the chaos and laughter of Sunnyside Daycare.
