Rain lashed against the cobblestone streets of Prague, turning the already slick surface into a treacherous skating rink. Emilia Novak, her auburn hair plastered to her forehead beneath a dripping beret, grimaced as she wrestled a rogue umbrella free from the clutches of a giggling toddler.

"Hold on tight, little one!" she said with a forced smile, tucking the errant umbrella back into its owner's chubby hand. "Prague's weather can be quite… spirited."

Emilia glanced up at the imposing silhouette of Prague Castle looming above them, shrouded in mist and rain. It was hardly the idyllic image she'd hoped to present to her group of ten wide-eyed American tourists huddled beneath a meager awning. This wasn't exactly how she envisioned starting her walking tour of "Prague: City of a Hundred Spires."  

But Emilia Novak was nothing if not adaptable. She knew that even the most challenging conditions couldn't dampen the spirit of adventure in true travelers. Besides, she had a story to tell – one woven into the very fabric of this ancient city, a story waiting to unfold with every cobblestone they traversed and every spire they glimpsed through the swirling mist.
