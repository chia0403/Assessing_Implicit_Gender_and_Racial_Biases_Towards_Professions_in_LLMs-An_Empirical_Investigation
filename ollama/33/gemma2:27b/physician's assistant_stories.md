The humid Charleston air clung to Eliza Marie Beaumont like a damp shawl as she hurried down Meeting Street. Tourists gawked at pastel-painted houses, their cameras clicking incessantly, oblivious to the urgency that thrummed in Eliza’s veins. The call had come just minutes ago – a code blue at MUSC, her alma mater and the place she called home professionally.

Eliza pushed open the heavy glass doors of the hospital and was immediately engulfed by the sterile scent of antiseptic and anxiety. She navigated the labyrinthine hallways with practiced ease, years of navigating this space ingrained in her muscle memory. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a counterpoint to the rhythmic beep of the cardiac monitor she knew was somewhere beyond those swinging double doors. 

Eliza Marie Beaumont, PA-C, wasn't just any physician assistant. She was known for her cool head under pressure, her uncanny ability to anticipate needs before they arose, and her unwavering dedication to her patients. Today, however, even her years of experience couldn't quell the rising tide of dread.  

This code blue wasn't just any patient. It was Dr. Samuel Hawthorne, her mentor, the man who had championed her career and taught her everything she knew about medicine.
