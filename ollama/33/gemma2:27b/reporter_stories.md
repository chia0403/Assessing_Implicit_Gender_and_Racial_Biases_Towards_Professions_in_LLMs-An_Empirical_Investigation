The humid New Orleans air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets as Evangeline "Evie" Dubois tapped impatiently on her worn notebook. Across the cracked Formica table sat Mr. Alphonse Dupree, a man whose wrinkles held more stories than all the libraries in the French Quarter combined. His rheumy eyes, however, were clouded with suspicion. 

"Now, Miss Dubois," he rasped, his voice like dry leaves skittering across cobblestones, "you gotta understand, talkin' 'bout things that go bump in the night ain't exactly good for business."

Evie leaned forward, her auburn braid falling over her shoulder like a silken serpent. "Mr. Dupree," she said softly, her voice laced with Southern charm and relentless curiosity, "I'm not here to hurt anyone. Just trying to get to the bottom of what happened at the old St. Louis Cemetery."
