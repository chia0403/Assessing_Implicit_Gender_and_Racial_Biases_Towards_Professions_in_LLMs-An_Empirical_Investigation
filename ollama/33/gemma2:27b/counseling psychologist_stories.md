The rhythmic drumming echoed the relentless anxieties that filled her waiting room. Today was proving particularly taxing. A frazzled young mother fretting over her toddler's tantrums, a grief-stricken widower struggling to find meaning in his solitude, and now, a new face: a man shrouded in shadows, clutching a worn leather briefcase as if it contained the world's secrets.
