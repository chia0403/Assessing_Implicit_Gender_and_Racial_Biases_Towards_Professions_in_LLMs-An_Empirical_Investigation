Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct, each drop a tiny explosion in the symphony of urban decay. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Detective Isabella "Izzy" Vargas stared out at the grimy street below, neon signs reflecting sickly off the puddles forming on the asphalt. A cigarette glowed between her lips, sending tendrils of smoke curling towards the fluorescent lights overhead.

Izzy wasn't a woman known for patience. Five years on the force in this godforsaken corner of Chicago had worn down any romantic notions she might have had about upholding justice. Today was no different. Another body lay cold, another family shattered. This time it was a young college student, found crumpled behind an abandoned warehouse, a single red rose clutched in his lifeless hand.

The file on her desk detailed the grim statistics: another victim in a string of seemingly unconnected murders plaguing the city. Each one different – age, gender, occupation – but each ending with the same macabre calling card: a crimson rose.  Izzy crushed the cigarette in the overflowing ashtray and pulled on her leather jacket. This time, she vowed, she wouldn't let another life be lost to this twisted game.
