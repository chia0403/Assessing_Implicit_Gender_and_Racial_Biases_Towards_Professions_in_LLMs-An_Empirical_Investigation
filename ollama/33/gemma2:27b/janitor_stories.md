The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Bartholomew "Bart" Quillfeather's head, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cavernous museum hall.  Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow light, swirling like miniature galaxies around Bart as he pushed his battered cleaning cart. The air hung heavy with the scent of mothballs and forgotten history – a potent cocktail that always made Bart feel strangely melancholy.

He paused beside a towering sarcophagus carved from obsidian, its surface gleaming ominously in the dim light.  Bart ran a calloused hand over the cool stone, feeling the weight of centuries pressed against his fingertips. He'd been a janitor at the Alexandria Museum of Antiquities for fifteen years, his days a monotonous cycle of mopping, dusting, and emptying overflowing ashtrays (a remnant from the museum's less enlightened past).

Tonight, however, felt different. A restless energy thrummed beneath the surface of the silence, a subtle vibration that prickled Bart's skin. Perhaps it was the full moon casting an eerie glow through the arched windows, or maybe it was simply the weight of all those ancient secrets whispering from the shadows. Whatever it was, Bart couldn’t shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to happen.
