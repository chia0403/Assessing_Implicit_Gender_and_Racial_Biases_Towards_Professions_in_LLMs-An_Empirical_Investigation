The air in "Nails by Nyla" hummed with the low whirring of electric files and the cheerful chatter of regulars catching up on gossip. Sunlight streamed through the storefront window, illuminating clouds of glittery dust motes dancing in the air. Nyla Jean-Baptiste expertly maneuvered a tiny drill bit around the edge of Mrs. Henderson's nail, shaping it into a perfect almond before smoothing out any imperfections with a delicate swipe of her buffer.

"Honey, you been working on those hands for an hour already," chuckled Mrs. Henderson, her eyes twinkling. "You sure you ain't trying to sculpt them into works of art?"

Nyla laughed, the sound bright and bubbly like the neon pink polish she was about to apply. "Just making sure they're perfect for your granddaughter's wedding, Ms. Henderson." She glanced up at the clock on the wall. "Speaking of which, shouldn't you be getting ready soon?"

Mrs. Henderson patted Nyla's hand affectionately. "You right, dear. But I wouldn't trust nobody else with these old claws. You got a magic touch."
