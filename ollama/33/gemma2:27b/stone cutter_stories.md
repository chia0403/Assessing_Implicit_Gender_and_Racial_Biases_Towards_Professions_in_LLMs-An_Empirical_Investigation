The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's weathered neck as he chipped away at the granite block. Dust, fine as powdered bone, danced in the air, catching the light like scattered jewels. The quarry echoed with the rhythmic clinking of his hammer against chisel, punctuated by the occasional groan of shifting rock as massive slabs were lowered from the cliff face via winch and rope.  Silas wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, squinting at the emerging form within the stone. It was to be a gargoyle, a fearsome creature perched atop the new cathedral spire. He'd been commissioned by Master Elmsworth himself, the architect renowned for his grand designs and even grander temper.

Silas wasn't one for grand pronouncements or lofty aspirations.  He found solace in the rough heft of stone, the cool touch of granite against his fingertips, the slow unveiling of beauty hidden beneath layers of unyielding earth. The gargoyle, however, was proving to be a challenge unlike any he'd faced before. Its face, twisted in a silent snarl, seemed to mock him with its intricate details â€“ every vein, every muscle, each razor-sharp tooth demanding painstaking precision.

As Silas hammered away at the creature's snarling maw, a flicker of movement caught his eye. Beyond the quarry walls, perched on a craggy outcrop overlooking the valley, something shifted. A figure cloaked in shadow, impossibly still and silent, watched him with an intensity that sent a shiver down his spine.

Was it just a trick of the light, a figment of his weariness? Silas couldn't shake the feeling he was being observed, scrutinized by unseen eyes.
