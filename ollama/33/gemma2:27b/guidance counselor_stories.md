Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the posters lining the walls - "Reach for Your Dreams!" and "You Are Capable of Anything!" felt cruelly ironic today. 

Eleanor leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. Her normally tidy desk was cluttered with student files: college applications, standardized test scores, handwritten pleas for help. The weight of their futures pressed down on her like a leaden cloak.  It wasn't just the usual senior year anxieties; this year felt different, heavier. There was an undercurrent of fear running through Northwood High, a palpable dread that whispered in the hallways and clung to the lockers.

A knock interrupted her thoughts. "Ms. Vance?" a hesitant voice called from beyond the door. Eleanor straightened up, plastering on her practiced smile.  "Come in," she said, bracing herself for whatever storm this student might bring.
