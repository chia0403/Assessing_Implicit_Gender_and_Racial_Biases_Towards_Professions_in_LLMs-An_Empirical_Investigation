The scent of lilies and lavender hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Eloise Briarwood. Her fingers danced across the velvety petals of a ruby-red rose, gently removing a thorn with practiced ease. Outside, rain lashed against the windows of "Blooms & Boughs," her small florist shop nestled in a quiet corner of Greenwich Village. The city throbbed beyond those panes, a symphony of honking horns and distant sirens, but inside Eloise's world was one of muted colors, soft textures, and the gentle rustle of leaves.  

Today, however, the usual calm felt disrupted. A chill snaked down Eloise's spine as she glanced at the clock, its hands inching towards noon.  A delivery hadn't arrived - a crucial shipment of orchids for Mrs. Davenport's anniversary gala. Without them, her carefully crafted arrangement would be incomplete, a floral tragedy waiting to happen. And Mrs. Davenport was notoriouslyâ€¦ particular. 

Eloise swallowed, anxiety tightening in her chest. She needed to find those orchids, and fast. But where?
