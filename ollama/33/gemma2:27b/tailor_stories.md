The air in The Stitching Serpent hung thick with the scent of beeswax and pipe tobacco. Sunlight, filtered through dusty shop windows, illuminated motes dancing above spools of thread like tiny celestial bodies. Elias Thorncroft, his silver hair neatly combed back from a sharp widow's peak, ran nimble fingers over a bolt of midnight blue velvet, its texture as smooth as a raven’s wing. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Port Azure bustled with merchants hawking wares and children chasing pigeons through the marketplace square. But within Elias's shop, time seemed to move at a slower pace, dictated by the rhythm of needle against fabric and the quiet tick of the grandfather clock in the corner.

Elias was renowned throughout the port city for his exquisite tailoring. Sailors came seeking sturdy breeches, merchants desired finely-cut suits, and even the occasional wealthy dame requested a gown fit for a queen. But today, Elias wasn't crafting for a paying customer. He was meticulously embroidering a crimson serpent onto a black silk waistcoat – a personal project he’d been laboring over for weeks. As he stitched, his mind wandered back to a time before Port Azure, before the shop, when he'd honed his craft in the bustling workshops of Veridia City, dreaming of a life by the sea.
