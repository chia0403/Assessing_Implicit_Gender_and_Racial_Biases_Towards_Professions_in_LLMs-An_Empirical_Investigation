The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and almond, a sweet fog punctuated by the sharp tang of lemon zest. Evangeline "Evie" Beaumont, her flour-dusted apron dusted with sugar crystals like fallen snowflakes, meticulously piped intricate vines onto a three-tiered wedding cake. Sunlight streamed through the bakery window, casting warm squares on the polished wooden countertop and illuminating the delicate buttercream roses already adorning the confection. Evie hummed softly to herself, lost in the rhythm of her work â€“ a world where every swirl and petal held the promise of joy.  

But today, the usual peace of Evie's haven was disrupted. A shadow fell across the counter, momentarily obscuring the sunlight. Turning, she found Mr. Henderson, the bakery's gruff owner, looming behind her. His face, usually etched with lines of concern, was contorted into a grimace. "Evie," he began, his voice gravelly, "we have a problem."
