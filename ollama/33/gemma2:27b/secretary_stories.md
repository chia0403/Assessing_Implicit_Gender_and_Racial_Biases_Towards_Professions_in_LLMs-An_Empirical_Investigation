Rain lashed against the windows of the grand Blackwood Manor, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the frosted glass. Inside, Amelia Winthrop adjusted her spectacles, her brow furrowed as she struggled to decipher Mr. Blackwood's sprawling handwriting. The antique oak desk creaked under the weight of ledgers and parchment, the air thick with the scent of old paper and pipe tobacco. A fire crackled merrily in the hearth, casting dancing shadows across the book-lined walls, but Amelia barely registered its warmth.

The storm had raged for days, isolating Blackwood Manor from the bustling city beyond. Mr. Blackwood, a recluse by nature, had grown increasingly agitated with each passing hour, his demands growing more erratic and urgent. Today's task: deciphering a cryptic letter written in a language Amelia didn't recognize. A prickle of unease ran down her spine. What secrets did this manor hold? And why was she suddenly at the center of them?
