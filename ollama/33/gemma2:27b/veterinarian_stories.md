Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Moreau's small veterinary clinic, blurring the already fading light of dusk. The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and wet dog fur, a familiar comfort that usually soothed Eve's frayed nerves. Tonight, however, even the comforting aroma couldn't ease the knot in her stomach.  

Her latest patient, a scruffy terrier mix named Scruffy (ironic, she thought wryly), whimpered softly on the exam table. His normally vibrant brown eyes were dulled with pain, and his breathing came in shallow, rattling gasps. Eve had already run all the necessary tests, and the results confirmed her worst fears: Scruffy was suffering from a rare, aggressive form of canine lymphoma. 

Eve glanced at the clock on the wall â€“ nearly seven pm. She knew she should close up shop, go home to her empty apartment and the company of a lukewarm cup of chamomile tea. But she couldn't bring herself to leave Scruffy alone in his suffering. Not tonight.
