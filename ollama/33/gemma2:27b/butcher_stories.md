The air in "Mort's Meats" hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy aroma of sawdust. Sunlight, slanting through the grime-coated windowpanes, cast long shadows across the worn wooden counter where Thaddeus Mortimer III, known to everyone as Mort, meticulously sharpened his cleaver. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Grimhaven bustled with morning market traffic, but inside Mort's shop, time seemed to move at a slower pace, punctuated by the rhythmic scrape of steel against stone. 


Mort wasn't one for idle chatter. A man of few words and even fewer smiles, he possessed a quiet intensity that both intimidated and respected his customers. His hands, scarred and calloused from years of handling carcasses, moved with a practiced precision that bordered on artistry. Today, however, Mort felt a disquiet settle in his gut, an uneasy premonition that something was amiss. The usual symphony of clanging cleavers and haggling vendors seemed muffled, replaced by a silence so profound it felt heavy.
