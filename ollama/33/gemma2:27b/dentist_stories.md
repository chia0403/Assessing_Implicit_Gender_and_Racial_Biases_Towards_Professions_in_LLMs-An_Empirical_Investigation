Rain lashed against the windowpane of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s dental practice, blurring the neon sign that proclaimed “Smiles for Miles” in flashing blue and green. The late afternoon storm had chased away most patients, leaving Eleanor alone with the rhythmic tick-tock of the ancient clock on her wall and the faint hiss of the nitrous oxide tank.

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The solitude was comforting at times, but today it felt oppressive. She longed for the clatter of instruments, the reassuring hum of the drill, the chatter of patients filling the waiting room.  It had been a slow week – unusually so for this time of year. Eleanor idly tapped her fingers on the countertop, staring out at the grey sky. The wind howled like a banshee, whipping a lone newspaper across the sidewalk in front of her practice.


What happens next?
