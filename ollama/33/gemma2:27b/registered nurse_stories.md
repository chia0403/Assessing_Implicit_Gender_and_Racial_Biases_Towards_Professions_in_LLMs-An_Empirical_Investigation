Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mimicking the frantic beat of Amelia Rose Cartwright's heart.  The air hung thick with the cloying scent of antiseptic and despair. Amelia tugged her pale blue scrubs tighter, wishing she could somehow absorb the palpable fear that clung to every corner of the dilapidated building. Tonight was different. Tonight, a shadow had fallen over St. Jude's, a shadow cast by the arrival of Patient Zero.  

Amelia adjusted the mask covering half her face, the thin barrier offering little comfort against the unknown virus ravaging the city. Outside, sirens wailed, a mournful symphony echoing the chaos within. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the night ahead. In Ward 5, a lone figure lay shrouded in isolation sheets, his fevered breaths rasping like sandpaper against the sterile air. He was their only hope â€“ and potentially their doom.
