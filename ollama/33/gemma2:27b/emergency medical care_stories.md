Rain lashed against the ambulance window, blurring the neon glow of the hospital sign in the distance.  Eleanor Vance, her brow furrowed in concentration, checked the vitals displayed on the monitor beside her again.  The rhythmic beep, usually a comforting sound, felt jarring tonight. 

Inside the back of the ambulance, a young man groaned, his face pale and clammy. His name was Lucas, and he'd been hit by a car while crossing the street. Eleanor had been first on scene, finding him sprawled on the asphalt, his leg twisted at an unnatural angle.  She'd stabilized him as best she could, administered pain relief, and now they were speeding towards St. Vincent's, praying every second that Lucas would make it.

The city around them was a symphony of sirens and splashing tires. Eleanor felt the familiar knot of adrenaline in her stomach, mixed with a deep empathy for the young man fighting for his life behind her.
