Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew "Bart" Quillfeather's cramped office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest. The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and aging paper, a familiar comfort amidst the growing storm brewing inside him. Bart, with his perpetually rumpled tweed jacket and spectacles perched precariously on his nose, stared at the ledger before him, its neat columns and rows suddenly blurring through unshed tears. The numbers, once a soothing symphony of order, now mocked him with their stark reality.

His employer, the esteemed Mr. Alistair Finch, had vanished. Not simply gone missing, but disappeared without a trace, leaving behind a mountain of unpaid debts and a swirling vortex of unanswered questions. Bart, the quiet, meticulous bookkeeper who'd spent years meticulously tending to Finch's accounts, was now thrust into a terrifying world beyond the tidy confines of his ledgers. The city outside – a labyrinthine web of cobbled streets and gaslight-illuminated alleys – seemed to pulse with a sinister energy he couldn't ignore.

He had a choice: bury himself deeper in the comfortingly familiar numbers, hoping the storm would pass, or venture into the unknown, armed with nothing but his wits and a tattered map leading to Finch's last known whereabouts - a dilapidated warehouse nestled on the edge of the shadowy Docks district.
