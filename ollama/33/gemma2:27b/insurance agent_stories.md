Rain hammered against the warped glass of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office window, mimicking the insistent drumming in his chest. Outside, the neon sign of "Quill & Feather Insurance: Protecting What Matters Most" flickered erratically, casting dancing shadows on the overflowing paperwork covering his desk. Bart, a man whose salt-and-pepper hair mirrored the perpetually overcast sky of Ashwood, sighed and rubbed his weary eyes.  

He'd been staring at Mrs. Hawthorne's claim for what felt like hours, the ink bleeding into a smear of anxieties mirroring his own. The fire that consumed her bakery had left not only ashes but an emotional chasm in its wake. Bart knew he needed to approve it – it was a legitimate claim – but the company's recent string of losses gnawed at him. Every approval felt like a gamble, a potential domino pushing the already precarious structure of Quill & Feather Insurance closer to collapse.
