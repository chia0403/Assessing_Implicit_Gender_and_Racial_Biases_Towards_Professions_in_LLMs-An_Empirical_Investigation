The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz as she polished a patient's molars, her brow furrowed in concentration. The scent of mint toothpaste battled with the faint metallic tang of blood â€“ a familiar olfactory cocktail in her small, windowless office at Smile Bright Dental. Outside, the San Francisco fog was rolling in, swallowing the Golden Gate Bridge whole and casting an eerie, grey light through the blinds.

Esme sighed softly. It was Tuesdays like this that made her question her life choices. The endless stream of patients with cavities, gingivitis, and dental phobias seemed to drain her energy, leaving her feeling more like a mechanic than a healer. 

But today was different. A new patient, scheduled for a routine cleaning at 2 pm, had piqued Esme's curiosity. His name was Lucian Blackwood, and something about the elegance of his moniker suggested he wasn't your typical San Franciscan tech bro.
