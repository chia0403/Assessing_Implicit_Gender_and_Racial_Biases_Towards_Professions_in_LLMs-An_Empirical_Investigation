The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his already sweat-soaked collar into a sodden rag. He perched precariously on the slanted slate roof, one hand gripping the edge of the chimney, the other carefully placing a new tile. Below him, the bustling city sprawled out like a wrinkled tapestry â€“ a chaotic symphony of honking horns, distant sirens, and the constant murmur of human activity. 

Eli loved this view. From up here, amongst the chimneys and gargoyles, he felt above it all. Above the grime and the noise, above the everyday struggles that seemed to weigh down everyone else.  He'd been a roofer since he was eighteen, learning the trade from his father, a man who'd taught him not just how to lay tiles but also the value of hard work and an honest day's pay. 

But today, something felt different. The familiar rhythm of hammering and laying tiles seemed disrupted by an unsettling unease that coiled in his gut. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched, scrutinized by unseen eyes.  He glanced around nervously, scanning the rooftops and the narrow alleyways below. Nothing. Just the usual urban tableau. Still, the nagging sensation lingered, a dark cloud hovering over his normally sunny disposition.
