The scent of crayons and stale apple juice hung heavy in the air of Ms. Eliza Brighton's third-grade classroom. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating swirling dust motes that danced like tiny fairies. Outside, the vibrant autumn foliage blazed with reds and oranges, a stark contrast to the muted yellows and blues splashed across the classroom walls. Eliza sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the organized chaos before her. Twenty-seven pairs of eyes, bright with curiosity and mischief in equal measure, were fixed on her. 

It was the first day back after fall break, and the usual buzz of excitement crackled through the room. Today, however, Eliza felt a knot of apprehension twisting in her stomach. A letter from the principal lay unopened on her desk, its crisp white envelope promising both opportunity and potential upheaval.
