Rain hammered against the windowpane of Henrietta "Hetty" Finch's cramped office, mirroring the headache blooming behind her left eye.  April 15th loomed like a monstrous, deadline-breathing beast, and Hetty was drowning in a sea of W-2s, 1099s, and receipts smelling faintly of stale coffee and desperation.

Her office, tucked away on the second floor above a dusty bookstore on Bleecker Street, wasn't much to look at.  The wallpaper peeled in protest against the constant dampness, and the only window overlooked a fire escape cluttered with overflowing garbage bins. But Hetty liked it this way. It was her sanctuary, her space where she could untangle the financial knots of strangers' lives, bringing order to chaos, one deduction at a time.

This year, however, felt different.  The usual humdrum of tax season had taken on a frenetic edge. Clients were agitated, more demanding, and Hetty couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. It started with a cryptic phone call from an unknown number, a voice whispering about "missing digits" and "the IRS watching." Then came the strange packages â€“ one containing a single antique key, another a faded photograph of a woman Hetty didn't recognize.  


Hetty sighed, pushing away the unsettling thoughts and picking up the next file: "Montgomery, Penelope."  She hoped this return wouldn't be anything out of the ordinary. But as she scanned the documents, her breath caught in her throat. The numbers were...off. Deliberately so.
