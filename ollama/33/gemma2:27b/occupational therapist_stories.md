Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the autumnal hues outside into an impressionistic smear.  Inside, Amelia Rose Thornton adjusted the straps on her patient's arm brace, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor provided a steady counterpoint to the storm raging beyond the glass.

Amelia wasn't one for drama, preferring the quiet satisfaction of helping others regain their independence. But even she couldn't deny the unsettling atmosphere that had descended upon St. Jude's. Whispers of "unusual activity" and "strange occurrences" flitted through the hallways like nervous sparrows. Amelia attributed it to the season â€“ shorter days, darker nights always seemed to bring out a touch of unease.

But today, something felt different. A prickle of intuition, cold and sharp as the November wind, warned her that this storm wasn't just meteorological.
