The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a fragrance Elijah "Eli" Blackwood knew better than his own reflection. Dawn was just breaking, painting streaks of orange and pink across the endless canvas of the Alaskan sky. Eli squinted at the towering spruce trees, their needles still dusted with the remnants of last night's frost. His breath plumed out before him, a fleeting ghost in the crisp air.

He hefted his axe onto his shoulder, its familiar weight grounding him. Today was a good day for logging. The snow had finally retreated, leaving behind soft earth that wouldn’t bog down the skidder. A fresh layer of fallen leaves crunched beneath his boots as he made his way towards the designated clearing, anticipation thrumming in his veins.

The forest whispered its secrets around him – rustling leaves, the distant cry of a raven, the gurgle of a hidden stream. Eli was part of this symphony of nature, his rhythm intertwined with its ancient pulse. He knew every bend and curve of these woods, every gnarled root and moss-covered boulder. This was his domain, where he felt most alive. 

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on the back of Eli's neck, a dissonance in the familiar harmony. He paused, scanning the silent trees, searching for the source of his apprehension. The feeling lingered, a shadow in the dappled sunlight.
