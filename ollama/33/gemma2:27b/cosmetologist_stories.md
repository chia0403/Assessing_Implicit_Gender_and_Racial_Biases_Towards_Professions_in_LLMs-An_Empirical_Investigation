The whir of blow dryers filled the air, punctuated by the rhythmic snip-snip of shears and the occasional burst of laughter. The scent of lavender shampoo and hairspray hung thick in the humid air of "Curl Up & Dye," a vibrant salon nestled on a bustling street corner in New Orleans' French Quarter. 

Elara Josephine Dubois, her fingers expertly weaving strands of auburn hair into an intricate braid, paused to admire her work in the mirror. Her reflection stared back: a woman with warm brown eyes framed by thick lashes, and a cascade of dark curls piled atop her head in a stylish updo. Elara, known affectionately as "Ellie" by her clients, possessed a contagious smile that put even the most anxious patrons at ease.  

Today, however, Ellie's usual cheer was tinged with apprehension. A stranger was scheduled to arrive for an appointment â€“ one Madame Evangeline Lafitte, a name whispered in hushed tones throughout the Quarter, rumored to be a powerful voodoo priestess.
