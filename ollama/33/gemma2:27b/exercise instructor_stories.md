The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the mirrored walls of Studio Sweat.  Sweat itself was practically a building material in this place; it clung to the air, thick and humid, mingling with the scent of lavender cleaner and exertion. Beatrice "Bea" Flores, her dark ponytail whipping around her shoulders as she demonstrated a squat jump, surveyed the room with a practiced eye. Ten pairs of eyes stared back at her, varying degrees of exhaustion and determination etched on their faces. 

Bea knew this class was tougher than usual. It was the early morning slot, reserved for those hardcore enough to drag themselves out of bed before the sun even thought about rising. But Bea thrived on pushing people, on seeing them break through their perceived limits. Today, though, something felt off. A low hum vibrated beneath her feet, a discordant note in the usual symphony of grunts and panting. 

As she transitioned into lunges, the hum intensified, morphing into a deep tremor that rattled the windows. Then, the lights flickered, plunged the room into darkness for a heart-stopping second before sputtering back on. A collective gasp rose from the class. Bea knew, with a shiver of unease, that this wasn't just another power glitch. Something strange was happening.
