Rain lashed against the windshield, mirroring Amelia Blackwood's frustration. She gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. The quaint Victorian home on Elm Street should have been charming, but in this weather, it looked more like a haunted gothic mansion looming out of the mist. 

Amelia was a real estate agent with Blackwood & Sons Realty, a family business steeped in tradition and generations of knowledge about the town's hidden gems. Yet, today, she felt anything but insightful. This listing – a sprawling, dilapidated beauty with peeling paint and overgrown gardens – was proving to be more of a nightmare than a dream sale.

The house stood sentinel at the end of a cobblestone lane, its silence broken only by the insistent drumming of rain. As Amelia parked, a gust of wind whipped past, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and something else... something vaguely metallic, like old blood. A shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't just the weather playing tricks on her. There was an unsettling energy about this place.
