Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

Opening:

As she sipped her coffee and gazed out the rain-soaked window of her office, Dr. Emily Julia Thompson couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. It was going to be one of those days, she could just feel it. The phone had already started ringing, and she knew that would only lead to a string of frazzled parents, frustrated kids, and broken dreams.

Setting:

Dr. Thompson's office was nestled in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon, amidst a vibrant mix of art galleries, vintage shops, and bustling cafes. The exterior walls were adorned with colorful murals, while the interior was warm and inviting, with plush armchairs and soft lighting. A floor-to-ceiling bookshelf lined one wall, overflowing with dusty tomes on occupational therapy, psychology, and neuroscience.

As an occupational therapist specializing in pediatric rehabilitation, Dr. Thompson had seen her fair share of traumas - physical, emotional, and psychological. From cerebral palsy to autism spectrum disorder, she had worked tirelessly to help children and families navigate the complex world of therapy and recovery. But today, with a fresh cup of coffee in hand and a stack of paperwork waiting to be filed, Dr. Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

What would bring her to this particular case? And what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of her latest patient's seemingly ordinary life? Only time would tell.
