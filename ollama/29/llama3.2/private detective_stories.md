Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the rain-soaked streets of Seattle, Washington. The grey skies seemed to match the mood of Emily Victoria "Evie" Thompson, a private investigator with a penchant for whiskey and a knack for getting herself into trouble. She stood outside her office, a cramped but cluttered room above a pawn shop on 1st Avenue, staring out at the neon lights of the city's seedy underbelly.

As she lit a cigarette and took a long drag, Evie's mind wandered back to the case that had brought her to this place. A mysterious woman had walked into her office an hour ago, her eyes red-rimmed from crying, and begged for Evie's help. Her name was Sarah Jenkins, and she claimed that her sister had gone missing in the city's infamous Belltown neighborhood - a hotbed of crime and corruption where even the most desperate souls went to lose themselves.

Evie knew better than to get involved with cases like this, but something about Sarah's desperation had struck a chord. Maybe it was the similarity between their own family histories, marked by loss and betrayal. Whatever the reason, Evie felt an itch she couldn't scratch - a need to dig deeper into Sarah's story and uncover the truth behind her sister's disappearance.

With a sigh, Evie stubbed out her cigarette and headed back inside, ready to start digging in the dark alleys of Seattle's underworld. Little did she know that this case would lead her down a rabbit hole of corruption, deceit, and secrets that threatened to destroy everything she thought she knew about herself.
