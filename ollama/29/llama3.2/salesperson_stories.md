Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly Wednesday morning in late October when Maxwell "Max" Thompson trudged into the office building that housed his small but thriving sales firm, Thompson & Associates. Located in the heart of downtown Portland, Oregon, the high-rise office complex was known for its stunning views of the Willamette River and its eclectic mix of startups and established companies.
