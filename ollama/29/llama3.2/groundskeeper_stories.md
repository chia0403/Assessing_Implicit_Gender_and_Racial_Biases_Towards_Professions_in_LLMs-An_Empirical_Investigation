Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the crumbling mansion, casting a warm orange glow over the overgrown gardens and weeping willows that lined the crumbling stone walls. The air was heavy with the scent of blooming lavender and the distant hum of bees as they flitted from flower to flower.

Emmett Wellesley Jenkins, groundskeeper at Ravenswood Manor, stood in his worn denim overalls, surveying the chaos he'd been tasked with containing. For 20 years, he'd kept the estate's gardens and lawns looking their best, despite the neglect and decay that had taken hold of the manor itself.

As he walked through the garden, Emmett's eyes landed on a particularly sad-looking flowerbed, where once-beautiful roses now struggled to bloom amidst the weeds and debris. He made a mental note to add it to his list for the next day's pruning and weeding, and continued his rounds, searching for any signs of trouble.

Ravenswood Manor had been in Emmett's family for generations, but after his father's passing, he'd inherited not only the estate's groundskeeping duties but also its financial burdens. The manor was a money pit, with crumbling walls, overgrown landscaping, and a roof that seemed to be held together by nothing more than twine and prayers.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, Emmett made his way back to the small cottage on the estate's grounds, where he would spend the evening poring over maps and plans for the manor's upkeep. Little did he know, however, that tonight would bring a surprise that would change everything...
