Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the English Channel, shrouding the crumbling stone walls and overgrown gardens of Ravenswood Manor in a damp, grey mist. Inside, housekeeper Emily Florence Waverley stirred the remains of last night's dinner - a congealed mess of beef and vegetables that had been left out too long in the chaos of the household's departure for the day.

As she scrubbed down the kitchen table with a stiff-bristled brush, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the usual creaks and groans of the old house - the way the wooden floorboards seemed to complain underfoot, or the faint scent of decay wafting up from the cellar like a chill breath. No, it was more than that.

It was the look in Mrs. Harrington's letterhead. The one her employer, Lady Harrington, had used for years - the same elegant script and faded crest that now seemed to leer at Emily from the kitchen table like a taunting riddle.

The words themselves were few: "Dear Emily Florence Waverley, I'm afraid I must leave you in charge of Ravenswood today. The doctor says it's not safe for me to travel..." But the implication was clear: Lady Harrington had left on short notice, and no one else seemed willing or able to take her place.

And now, as the fog swirled outside like a living thing, Emily felt herself facing the daunting task of keeping Ravenswood Manor running - without its mistress.
