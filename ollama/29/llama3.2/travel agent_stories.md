Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the sky, Aurora "Rory" Wynter gazed out at the bustling streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, her eyes lingering on the neon-lit skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. The hum of the city was in full swing, with pedestrians rushing to and fro, each one lost in their own world. Rory, however, felt a sense of restlessness wash over her as she stood at the edge of Shibuya Crossing, the sounds of the city muffled by the earbuds plugged into her ears.

A travel agent by trade, Rory had spent the better part of five years building a reputation for herself in the industry, expertly crafting bespoke itineraries for clients from all over the globe. But as much as she loved the thrill of planning the perfect vacation, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. She felt like she was stuck in neutral, going through the motions day after day without any real sense of purpose or direction.

Rory's eyes narrowed slightly as she thought about her current situation. Her agency had just landed a major contract with a luxury travel firm, and while it meant a nice boost to her income, it also meant that Rory would be spending more and more time in the office, less time exploring the world on her own terms. She sighed softly, tucking a strand of dark hair behind her ear as she contemplated the choices ahead.
