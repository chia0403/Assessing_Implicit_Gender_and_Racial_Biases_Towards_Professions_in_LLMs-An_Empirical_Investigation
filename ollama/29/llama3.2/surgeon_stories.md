Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Elliot Alexander Thompson stood at the edge of his hospital room window, gazing out over the city skyline as the sun set behind the skyscrapers. The cool breeze carried the scent of exhaust fumes and saltwater, a familiar mix that never failed to clear his head after a long day in the operating room.

As a cardiothoracic surgeon at Mercy General Hospital, Elliot had seen it all - the triumphs and tragedies, the life-or-death decisions and the quiet moments of healing. He had always been drawn to the intricate dance of human anatomy, the way the heart beat and the lungs breathed in harmony with the rest of the body.

But tonight, as he stood at his window, Elliot's mind was elsewhere. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, a nagging sense of unease that had been growing in the back of his mind all day. It started with a phone call from an old patient, one who had undergone a successful bypass surgery just last week. Now, he was back on the line, sounding...different.

Elliot's eyes narrowed as he tried to place the tone, but it slipped away before he could grasp it. He sighed and turned away from the window, his gaze falling on the row of framed photographs on the wall opposite him. There were pictures of his family - his wife, Rachel, and their two kids, Emily and Jack - all beaming smiles that seemed to mock him with their happiness.

He shook off the feeling, telling himself it was just nerves from a long day. But as he made his way back to his desk, his eyes kept drifting back to the phone on the floor, wondering if he should answer the call...
