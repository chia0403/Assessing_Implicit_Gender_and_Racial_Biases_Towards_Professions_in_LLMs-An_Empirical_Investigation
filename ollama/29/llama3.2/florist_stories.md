As the last wisps of morning fog lifted off the cobblestone streets of Ashwood Village, Emilia Rose Pembly prepared for another day at her family's esteemed flower shop, Petal & Stem. The village, nestled in the heart of England, was renowned for its quaint charm and vibrant floral arrangements, which Emilia took great pride in creating.

Emilia, a 25-year-old florist with a wild mane of curly brown hair and a talent for coaxing even the most reluctant blooms into radiant bloom, stood amidst the colorful chaos of her shop. Petal & Stem's walls were adorned with an eclectic assortment of vases, from delicate antique china to modern glassware, each one filled with an explosion of scents and colors that seemed to dance in the morning light.

With a gentle smile, Emilia surveyed her domain, taking note of the various orders awaiting completion: a wedding bouquet for the village's most eligible bachelor, a funeral arrangement for the rector's family, and a series of bouquets for the village fete, which was just a day away. As she began to methodically unpack the previous day's deliveries, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss in Ashwood Village – a whispered rumor here, a faint scent of decay there – but she pushed the unease aside, focusing instead on the beauty and wonder of her craft. Little did she know, this ordinary morning would soon become anything but ordinary.
