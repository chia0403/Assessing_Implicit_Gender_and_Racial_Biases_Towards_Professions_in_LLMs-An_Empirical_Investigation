Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the weathered wooden docks and the bustling harbor. The smell of saltwater and freshly caught seafood filled the air, mingling with the sound of seagulls crying overhead.

In a small studio apartment above the local bookstore, Aurora "Rory" Wynter was preparing for another long night of shooting photographs. A talented and fiercely independent photographer in her mid-twenties, Rory had made a name for herself capturing the raw beauty of Tidal Cove's rugged coastline and its quirky community. With a camera slung over her shoulder and a portfolio full of her work displayed proudly on the walls, she was waiting for the perfect shot to capture the essence of this enchanting town.

As she worked, Rory couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The town seemed quieter than usual, and the tourists were scarce. The local fishermen had been complaining about strange occurrences in the harbor, and the police were tight-lipped about any developments. Despite her growing unease, Rory felt a spark of excitement at the prospect of capturing this mysterious, almost eerie atmosphere on film.

Little did she know, tonight would be the night that changed everything...
