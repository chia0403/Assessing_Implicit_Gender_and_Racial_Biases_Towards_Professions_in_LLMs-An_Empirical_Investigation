Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Opening:

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Emily Anne Jenkins stared blankly at the stack of 1040 forms in front of her, each one a reminder that another day had dawned on her desk job as an income tax preparer. It was the first Monday morning of April, and the waiting game had already begun - would this be the year she finally broke free from the monotony of crunching numbers for middle-class families?

Setting:

The story takes place in the small town of Oakdale, Illinois, a quintessential American Main Street with a faded downtown and a dwindling population. The local coffee shop, where Emily spent most of her breaks, was a hub of activity - a gathering spot for the townspeople to share news and gossip over steaming cups of joe. As she looked out the window, Emily watched as the sun rose over the cornfields, casting a golden glow over the sleepy town.

Emily's tax preparation business, Jenkins & Co., was nestled in a small office above the local hardware store. The exterior was plain, with a faded sign that creaked in the gentle breeze, but inside, it was cozy and organized, filled with stacks of tax manuals, calculators, and the comforting scent of paper clips. It was a far cry from the excitement of her dreams, but it was home - for now.

How's this? I'd be happy to continue developing the story or make any changes if you have suggestions!
