Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Sofia Elara Vasquez stood at the edge of the rooftop observation deck, gazing out at the glittering expanse of New York City as the sun set behind the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan. The wind whipped her dark hair into a frenzy as she clutched her worn leather satchel tightly to her side, the only sound the distant hum of the city and the soft beeping of the bioluminescent plants that lined the perimeter of the rooftop garden.

As a leading researcher in the field of microbiology, Sofia had spent countless hours studying the unique properties of these glowing organisms, which she believed held the key to unlocking new treatments for some of the world's most deadly diseases. But tonight, her thoughts were consumed by more pressing concerns - concerns that went beyond the sterile confines of her laboratory.

A faint tremor in her hand betrayed her excitement as she fished out a small vial of glowing liquid from her satchel and examined it under the soft glow of the city lights. It was an extraordinary specimen, one that had been passed down to Sofia through generations of her family - a family with secrets and traditions that went far beyond the realm of science.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the sky in a warm orange glow, Sofia felt a shiver run down her spine. She knew that she was on the cusp of something momentous - something that would change everything she thought she knew about herself, her research, and the world at large. Little did she know, however, that this moment would be followed by darkness, danger, and a journey that would take her to the very limits of human endurance.

How's this? I've introduced Dr. Sofia Elara Vasquez as a research scientist with a unique background and expertise in microbiology. The setting is established as New York City, specifically on a rooftop observation deck overlooking Manhattan.
