Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Elliot Thompson stared out at the mist-shrouded bay, his eyes lost in thought as he stood on the worn wooden dock that jutted out into the water. The salty spray mingled with the scent of seaweed and diesel fuel, a familiar smell that brought him back to summers spent here as a child. The small coastal town of Ravenswood was still quiet this morning, the only sounds the gentle lapping of waves against the shore and the distant call of gulls.

As a dentist in the city, Elliot had traded the peaceful rhythms of Ravenswood for the hustle and bustle of downtown life. But he'd always felt a connection to his hometown, one that grew stronger with each passing year. His father, a fisherman, had passed away just a few months ago, leaving behind a legacy of love and loss.

Elliot's eyes drifted back to the house across the way, its windows still aglow with the morning light. He knew he'd have to face his family's expectations soon â€“ his mother was already talking about moving in with him, much to Elliot's dismay. As he stood there, the fog began to lift, revealing a world that was both familiar and foreign.
