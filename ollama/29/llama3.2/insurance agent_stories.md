Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Ashwood were always at their most unforgiving on Wednesday mornings. The kind of day that made you want to curl up with a cup of coffee and forget about the world outside. But for Emily Joanne Wilson, insurance agent extraordinaire, there was no time for such indulgences. She had a meeting with a potential new client at 9 AM, and she still needed to get her car serviced before the storm made the roads impassable.

Her dark brown hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, and her tailored suit was a stark contrast to the drizzly chaos outside.

As she made her way through the deserted streets, Emily Joanne couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. Something didn't add up about Mrs. Jenkins' story, and she had a feeling that this meeting would be anything but ordinary...
