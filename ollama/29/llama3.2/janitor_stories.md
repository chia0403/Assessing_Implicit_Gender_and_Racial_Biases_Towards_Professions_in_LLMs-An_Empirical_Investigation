Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the worn linoleum floor of the old library, where Emilia Jane Wilson pushed her cart of cleaning supplies through the deserted aisles. It was 2:45 AM on a typical Tuesday morning, and the only sound was the soft hum of the air conditioning units and Emilia's own labored breathing as she worked to keep the stacks tidy.

As the janitor of the historic downtown library, Emilia took pride in her work, knowing that without her efforts, the musty smell of old books would linger, attracting curious critters and unwanted visitors. She had worked at the library for five years now, and it was a job she loved almost as much as she loved getting lost in the shelves on quiet nights like this.

As she emptied the trash can behind the circulation desk, Emilia's eyes drifted to a book that always caught her attention: a tattered leather-bound volume with a silver lock and key embossed on its cover. It was said that the library's most valuable artifact, a rare 19th-century edition of "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley, had been hidden in this very book for safekeeping.

Emilia had heard whispers among the librarians about the true identity of the mysterious owner who'd donated the book all those years ago. Some claimed it was the reclusive millionaire with a penchant for classic horror; others whispered that it was a former patron who'd left behind a legacy of literary love. Emilia didn't know what to believe, but she did know one thing - on this particular night, as she swept and mopped, something felt off.

And then, just as she finished her rounds, the lights flickered once, twice, before dying altogether. The darkness was sudden, oppressive, and utterly unsettling.
