Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The fog rolled in off the docks, shrouding the narrow streets of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp cloth. It was a chill autumn evening, the kind that made you want to wrap up tight and stay inside by the fire. But for Jack "Mac" McTavish, plumber extraordinaire, it was just another night on the job.

Mac had spent the day fixing leaky faucets and unclogging drains in the wealthy neighborhoods of Ravenswood, where the streets were paved with gold and the people were as posh as they were picky. He wasn't one for the fancy crowd, but he knew how to navigate their expectations - and get paid for it.

As he climbed into his trusty van, the "Toilet Whisperer," Mac couldn't shake the feeling that tonight was going to be different. It started with a mysterious phone call from an old acquaintance, a dockworker named Mike who claimed to have found something strange on one of the boats that had been pulled out for the night's repair schedule.

"What is it, Mike?" Mac asked, as he hooked up his tools and fired up the engine.

"It's not what," Mike said, his voice low and serious. "It's who."

Mac raised an eyebrow, intrigued despite himself. What kind of trouble could a guy like Mike get himself into? He started the van and pulled out onto the foggy streets, wondering what lay ahead.
