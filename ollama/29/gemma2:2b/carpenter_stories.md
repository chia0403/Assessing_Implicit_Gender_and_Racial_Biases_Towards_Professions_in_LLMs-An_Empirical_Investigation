The aroma of sawdust and pine hung thick in the air, a familiar scent that Elias knew better than any other. He was used to the roughness, the tang, the way it seemed to cling to his weathered hands like old friends. It was his workshop, his sanctuary, his lifeblood. 

He stood at the workbench, sunlight filtering through the dusty pane of his front window and illuminating a half-finished birdcage. The intricate carvings around the door were meant to mimic the delicate curves of a swallow's wings; a piece he had been working on for weeks, ever since he received the commission from Mrs. Peterson. 

The old woman had been distraught when her once proud finch, Featherstone, was found dead in its cage last month. "He's gone," she'd said, voice thick with grief, "and I can't bear to be without him." Elias knew he could build a better one, stronger, sturdier, and one that would ensure the small bird’s peace for years to come. 

The town of Oakhaven was quiet this time of year, a quaint tapestry woven from sleepy mornings and hushed afternoons. Yet, a sense of unease lingered in Elias' gut, a nagging feeling that something wasn't quite right. Even as he meticulously placed the last piece of wood on the birdcage, a shadow seemed to pass by his window – fleeting, yet unmistakable. He was no stranger to secrets, whispers, and strange occurrences within Oakhaven’s quiet streets.
