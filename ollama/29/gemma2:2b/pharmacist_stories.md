The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and pine in Mrs. Thistlewick's Apothecary. It was a haven nestled amongst the bustling cobblestone streets of Oldtown, where time seemed to have paused its relentless march. The flickering gaslights cast long shadows across shelves overflowing with vials and powders, each one brimming with potent secrets waiting to be unlocked by someone brave enough to dare. This was the realm of Esme Delacroix, a woman whose nimble fingers could coax a cure from the most stubborn ailment. 

Esme's keen eyes scanned the shop’s familiar landscape as she finished restocking the shelf containing "Potion of Forgetfulness," its glass bottle adorned with an emerald charm that pulsed faintly in her palm. The old adage, 'Familiarity breeds contempt,' held true for Esme, a woman who knew each ingredient, each scent, and every recipe by heart. 

But even for someone as deeply familiar with the potions' magic as she was, a strange unease stirred within her. Tonight, however, felt different. A disquiet that wouldn't be quelled by a calming cup of chamomile tea hung heavy in the air, and Esme couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss.
