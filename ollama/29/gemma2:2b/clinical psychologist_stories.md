## Setting:

The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and old paper as Dr. Elara Thorne entered the tiny office. Sunlight, filtering through dust motes dancing in the air, illuminated the worn-out furniture, faded textbooks, and framed photos of smiling faces – all frozen in time. It was a relic from another era, tucked away in the heart of rural Maine. 

## Story Opening:

Dr. Elara Thorne surveyed the room with a sigh.  It was a familiar sight, a haven she had built for herself over the years. The silence was almost suffocating, broken only by the gentle whirring of the ceiling fan and the occasional creak of the aging building. She closed her eyes, drawing in a deep breath of the damp, earthy scent of Maine soil that seemed to permeate everything here, a reminder of the life she chose for herself – away from the bustling city, its relentless pace, and the pressures of modern life. Yet today, even this sanctuary felt off.  The usual calm was replaced by a nagging unease. A sense of being watched.

Elara’s gaze fell on her notebook, its pages filled with meticulously written notes, case studies of patients she'd helped navigate their way through life's storms. But tonight, even the familiar faces seemed to flicker in and out of focus. The quiet hum of the room was almost deafening. It wasn't just the usual pre-session jitters; this felt different, more urgent.  She had been expecting a difficult case to open, but Elara found herself increasingly unsettled by the stillness.

What will happen next? Will Elara confront the feeling of being watched, or will she continue to ignore it? How does her experience in the quiet solitude of Maine affect her work with patients and their own journeys? You can decide!
