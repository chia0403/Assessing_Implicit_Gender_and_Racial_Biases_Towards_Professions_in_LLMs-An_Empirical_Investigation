The midday sun beat down on Caleb "Hawkeye" Henderson's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Dust motes danced in the heat shimmer as he surveyed the crumbling facade of the old Victorian mansion. It was a monument to forgotten grandeur, its peeling paint and sagging roofline whispering stories of opulence lost to time.  This wasnâ€™t his usual stomping ground; Caleb was used to concrete jungles and steel-and-glass towers. This place felt like a ghost from another century. 

"You sure this is the right address, Miss Mabel?" Caleb asked through gritted teeth, glancing at the woman in her floral dress holding a battered map. Her freckled face crinkled into a smile that was almost as faded as the mansion's plaster.  

The old Victorian mansion stood sentinel over Caleb's world of cranes and bulldozers. "I got this address from my Great Aunt Millie," Mabel chirped, her voice thick with Southern charm, "and she swore blind it was yours." 


**Setting:** A dilapidated Victorian mansion in a quaint, forgotten town that appears to be swallowed by the surrounding countryside, somewhere along a dusty, two-lane road. The mansion is surrounded by overgrown gardens and neglected grounds, hinting at its opulent past but bearing only fragments of memories.
