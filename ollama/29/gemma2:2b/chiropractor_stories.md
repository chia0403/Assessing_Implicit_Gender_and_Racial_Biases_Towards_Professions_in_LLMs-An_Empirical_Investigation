The scent of pine needles and damp earth hung heavy in the air as Dr. Amelia Thorne adjusted her posture at the clinic's entrance.  A brisk autumn wind whipped through the towering pines lining the Oregon coast, scattering fallen leaves across the worn wooden steps. The old building hummed with a quiet energy that was both calming and unsettling for anyone who didn’t know its secrets. It had been here since her grandfather built it, nearly a century ago. Now, Amelia felt like she carried part of his legacy – along with years of accumulated knowledge about the human body – in her hands. She looked at the weathered exterior, picturing the first time she'd stepped inside as a child, filled with wonder and a sense of safety, before the world had started to feel too big, too fast for even her young spirit. 


Inside, patients waited on mismatched chairs, their eyes glazed over in anticipation of Amelia’s gentle hands and unwavering calm. She was one of only a few chiropractors left within the quaint coastal town, serving the needs of a community that valued health and well-being above all else.  The setting, however, wasn't what Amelia had envisioned for her practice. 

This place felt more like a time capsule than a modern clinic. The waiting area was cluttered with antique furniture, bookshelves overflowing with vintage anatomical charts and hand-drawn diagrams, and a faded portrait of Amelia's grandfather smiling down on her from the wall. Amelia adjusted her apron and took a deep breath. The smell of old wood, fresh linen, and decades-old hope filled her nostrils, a familiar scent that brought both comfort and melancholy in equal measure.
