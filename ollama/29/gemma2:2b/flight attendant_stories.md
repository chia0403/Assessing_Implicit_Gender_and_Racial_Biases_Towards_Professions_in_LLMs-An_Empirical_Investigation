The midday sun bled through the windowpanes of Flight 321's galley, illuminating Amelia "Amy" Sinclair's worn face. Her hands, usually nimble in serving passengers, hovered listlessly over the half-empty coffee machine. The air was thick with the aroma of burnt sugar and stale dreams - a familiar cocktail for a flight attendant on a cross-country route. 

The setting sun painted long shadows across the cramped cabin, each passenger's body a miniature island of its own. Amy gazed out the window as the landscape of Missouri transformed from rolling farmlands to barren steel canyons. The rhythmic drone of her thoughts mirrored the steady hum of the plane's engines - a constant reminder that somewhere, thousands of miles away, another storm was brewing. 

Amy wasn't just serving passengers; she was serving time - each hour she spent in this metal bubble felt like an eternity. She yearned for something beyond turbulence, beyond cramped quarters and endless cups of lukewarm coffee.  But as a child, a chance encounter with her grandfather had instilled a deep-seated love for flying. The dream had always been to become a pilot, but the financial burden of flight school was too insurmountable. Now, all she could do was serve, patiently waiting for the day her dreams would finally soar.
