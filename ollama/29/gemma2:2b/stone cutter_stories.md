The rhythmic clang of his hammer echoed through the workshop, punctuated by the occasional rasp of a saw.  **Bartholomew "Bart" Thorne**,  with hands roughened and calloused like ancient parchment, worked with the precision of a surgeon on a life-or-death case.  His workspace, nestled within the labyrinthine heart of the Old City's stone quarries, was a symphony of grit and light – chipped grey granite walls bathed in the warm glow of dying sunlight filtering through stained glass windows. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of crushed rock and the faint sweetness of honeysuckle from the small patch of garden that clung to the edge of the workshop, Bart's secret haven amongst the towering piles of raw stone.  He’d inherited the quarry and its sprawling workshop from his father, a man who had carved his own legacy into the very earth itself. Now, with each piece he shaped, Bart felt a familiar pull, an ancestral urge to etch stories upon stone, to translate human emotions into enduring monuments. 

But tonight was different. Tonight, he wasn't creating something new, but something old, buried deep beneath layers of dust and forgotten memories: the weathered stone coffin his grandmother had used as a cradle for his newborn self.  Bart stared at it, the rough-hewn wood barely visible beneath the grime. It was time to say goodbye.
