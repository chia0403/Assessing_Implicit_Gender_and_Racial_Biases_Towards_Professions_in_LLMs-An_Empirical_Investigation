## The Unspoken Knot

Rain lashed against the windows of "Serenity Springs," its drumming a familiar rhythm to Elara Thorne. Elara, with her auburn hair always pulled back into a messy bun, felt a knot tighten in her own stomach before the storm even reached the door. Her therapist's couch was adorned with a tapestry depicting a mountain meadow, an ironic choice considering the turbulent emotions swirling inside her.  The scent of lavender and citrus oil hung heavy in the air, usually soothing, but tonight it only amplified the pressure building within Elara. Tonight was the night.

Elara took a deep breath, trying to anchor herself to the steady hum of the heater, the quiet rustle of paper towels tucked into a wicker basket beside her. The door clicked open and she saw him - Ethan Miller, a man who embodied the calm stillness his name suggested.  His eyes, normally bright and full of life, were clouded with an unspoken sorrow. Elara, used to working with the anxieties of others, felt drawn to him.
