The sun beat down on Elara Thorn's worn leather work boots as she surveyed the manicured lawns bordering Willow Creek Manor.  She adjusted her straw hat perched precariously over her dark braids, watching the lazy sway of the windblown leaves in the towering oak trees that lined the property.

He was known for his eccentric habits, a penchant for rare herbs he cultivated within the sprawling gardens, and an aloof demeanor that sent even the most seasoned courtiers scurrying for safety. Elara knew her job well:  keep the grounds pristine, maintain a semblance of order amidst the chaos, and never, ever, pry into the Dukeâ€™s private life. But lately, she couldn't help but feel something was amiss - an undercurrent of unease thrummed beneath the surface of the seemingly tranquil manor grounds. Elara was about to find out what that feeling meant when a raven arrived with a single black feather clutched in its beak.
