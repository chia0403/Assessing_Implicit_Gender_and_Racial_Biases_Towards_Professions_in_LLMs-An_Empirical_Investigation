The rhythmic tick-tock of his old grandfather clock echoed through Elias Blackwood's tiny workshop. The aroma of cedar wood, worn leather, and the faint sweetness of lavender lingered in the air as he meticulously stitched a fine burgundy waistcoat, its intricate pattern barely discernible under his skillful hand.  Outside, the bustling city of Atheria hummed with life – carriages clattered down cobbled streets, gossiping vendors hawked their wares, and children's laughter danced on the wind. But inside Elias's workshop, a world of quiet focus reigned. 

Elias, known by everyone simply as "Blackwood," was a master tailor in Atheria's old quarter, where centuries-old buildings rose like stone giants beside cobblestone paths teeming with life. Each stitch he poured his soul into reflected the quiet strength and elegance of his craft; each piece he created became more than fabric and thread – it was an extension of the wearer's personality. Today, however, a wave of anxiety washed over him as he finished stitching the last buttonhole on the waistcoat.  His work was not just for ordinary citizens anymore. This waistcoat held a special request from Lady Elara Thorne, the reigning Duchess of Atheria and renowned beauty – and she wanted it delivered by dusk.
