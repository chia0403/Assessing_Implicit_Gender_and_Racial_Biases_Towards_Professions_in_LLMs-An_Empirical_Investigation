Rain lashed against the canvas tarp overhead, mimicking the furious drumbeat in Silas Blackwood's chest. He hunched deeper into his worn leather coat, pulling it tighter around himself like a second skin as he surveyed the ravaged landscape. Gone were the emerald pines of his childhood; replaced by skeletal trees, their needles brown and brittle, clinging to life with desperation.  

Silas, known to most simply as "Black," had inherited his father's logging business, a legacy built on grit, cunning, and an unwavering belief in the power of wood. But now, even that weathered faith felt shaky against the backdrop of this scorched earth. The rain was only part of the problem. There were whispers, rumours swirling through the small town like dust devils - whispers of "The Curse" â€“ a supernatural force he'd dismissed as folklore until now. The trees, once proud and strong, fell silent, dying on their own terms, leaving behind a silence that felt more oppressive than any storm.
