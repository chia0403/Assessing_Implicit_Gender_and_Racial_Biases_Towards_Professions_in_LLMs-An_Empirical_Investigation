The midday sun beat down on Ironkeep's sprawling walls, its rays shimmering off the granite and steel that formed the city's formidable defense against the encroaching wilderness.  Bartholomäus Grimstone, whose grizzled beard hinted at the years he’d spent protecting these very walls, adjusted his helm. The air hung heavy with a combination of sweat and the metallic tang of rusted steel from the city's ever-active forge. He scanned the parade of guardsmen filing through the gatehouse, each one an echo of himself in some way – stoic, reliable, unyielding – yet all lacking the same resolute glint that he wore on his brow. 

A young recruit, barely a man with barely a year of training under his belt, stumbled near him, his eyes wide and his face a canvas of anxiety.  “Sir,” he stammered, his voice cracking like an old drum. "There's trouble down by the docks."   Bartholomäus raised an eyebrow, ever cautious. The city was a place where secrets were traded in hushed whispers and shadows, but there was always a certain rhythm to it, a natural pulse that throbbed through its arteries. This urgency, however, felt different, like a discordant note on the city’s usual symphony of clangs and shouts. He knew he had to find out what was stirring this unease.
