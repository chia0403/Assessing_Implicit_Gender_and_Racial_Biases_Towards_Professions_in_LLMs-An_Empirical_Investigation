## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the library's towering windows, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves outside into a watery kaleidoscope. Inside, Amelia Thorne carefully arranged a stack of dusty biographies on her cluttered desk, her brow furrowed in concentration.  A scent of aged paper and damp wood filled the air, mingling with the faint aroma of freshly brewed tea, a calming counterpoint to the chaos of a rainy Tuesday afternoon. Amelia was usually at her most comfortable amongst these hushed corners, her world built of towering bookshelves, whispered histories, and the comforting weight of a well-worn novel in her hands. 

But today, an unnerving tension hung in the air, almost as tangible as the cold seeping from the drafty windows.  A single, unopened envelope sat atop Amelia's desk like a silent accusation - an invitation to a family gathering that was anything but welcoming. The Thorne legacy wasn't known for its warmth; it was steeped in the shadows of lost dreams and secrets whispered down through generations. 


**Setting:**

The story takes place at **Oakhaven Library**, a historic Victorian building with sprawling stacks of books, secret passages, and whispers of forgotten stories.  It embodies a sense of timeless wonder, yet is subtly haunted by the echoes of its inhabitants' long-buried pasts. The library's interior is rich in history and detail, reflecting Amelia's own fascination with her family's intricate legacy.
