The aroma of turmeric and ginger filled Amelia's tiny kitchen as she prepared her usual pre-dawn smoothie. It was 6:00 am, just enough time to squeeze in a quick morning ritual before her day began. Amelia wasn't exactly known for her "morning person" status - far from it.  But this routine, meticulously crafted by her late grandmother's wisdom and years of practice, held the key to maintaining a semblance of order and health within the chaotic storm of her life. 

Amelia was no stranger to chaos.  As a dietician in the heart of New York City’s bustling Lower East Side, she navigated the demanding schedules of busy professionals and their even busier kids, all while trying to decipher the complex language of dietary needs and social pressures. She had seen it all - from fad diets that promised quick fixes to the relentless pursuit of "wellness" that often felt more performative than genuine.  

Tonight's challenge lay not with another demanding client or a last-minute consultation, but with a personal one: her estranged mother, Evelyn, was about to arrive in New York for a crucial liver transplant procedure. Amelia had always been wary of Evelyn’s volatile temper and unhealthy relationship with food, fearing that this journey might only further expose the cracks in their fractured connection.
