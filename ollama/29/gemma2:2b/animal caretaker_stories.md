The salty tang of seaweed stung Amelia’s nose as she surveyed the grey expanse of the cove.  Even in her warmest coat, the October chill clung to the air like a wet sheet. Amelia adjusted the worn leather strap on her satchel, its contents - a collection of fish pellets and hand-stitched blankets - rattling reassuringly against her hip. "Alright, Sparky," she murmured, her voice swallowed by the wind whistling off the churning sea.  It was time for their daily ritual: feeding the rescued pups, who were as unpredictable and skittish as the tide itself. 

This wasn't just any cove; it was the Sea Whispering Sanctuary, a hidden haven tucked between crashing waves and treacherous rocks. Amelia had inherited this place from her grandfather, a man whispered to be possessed of an uncanny understanding of the wild souls that called it home. The sanctuary’s purpose? To care for orphaned pups, abandoned or mistreated, whose survival was precarious beyond the whims of nature’s bounty. 

As she reached the edge of the cove, a flash of black and white darted across the rocky outcrop. It was Sparky, a young seal pup with a mischievous glint in his eyes and an undeniable swagger that defied his size. Amelia smiled, already anticipating the playful leaps and barks that followed whenever he spotted her approaching.
