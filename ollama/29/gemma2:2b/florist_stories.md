The scent of roses hung heavy in the air, thick and sweet like summer rain after a long drought.  Rain or shine, however, it was always a struggle to keep up with the demands at "Blooms & Branches", the quaint floral shop nestled between a boisterous bakery and a dusty antique store in the sleepy coastal town of Havenwood. This was where Eloise Hawthorne's talents bloomed - literally. Her hands moved gracefully as she weaved together vibrant arrangements, transforming simple stems into works of art that brought joy to even the most cynical heart. 

But today, the shop seemed strangely silent. A faint breeze rattled the windowpanes, carrying with it the whispers of a coming storm, and Eloise couldn't shake off a feeling of unease. The normally cheerful chatter of customers had been replaced by an unsettling stillness. Even the wind chimes hanging outside her shop, normally singing sweet melodies, were eerily silent.  Something wasn't right in Havenwood.
