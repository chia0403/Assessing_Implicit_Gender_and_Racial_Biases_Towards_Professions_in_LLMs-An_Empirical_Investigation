The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and something else, something floral but sharp like a blade – a fragrance that usually calmed Dr. Elias Thorne, but tonight it was grating on his nerves.  His office at the Mercy General Hospital was a stark contrast to the sun-drenched Californian coast he'd once called home, its sterile white walls mirroring the cold fear gnawing at him.  He stood before the patient's chart, tracing a calloused finger over the words that spelled out the diagnosis – "Acute Pancreatitis". A single tear slid down his cheek unnoticed by the blurred faces of two interns staring at him with worried eyes from behind their respective stacks of files and instruments. The flickering fluorescent lights seemed to amplify his own internal shadows. 

Elias's hands, once steady as a mountain stream, now trembled slightly.  He was facing his greatest fear – the fragility of human life laid bare in the stark white canvas of a hospital bed. His entire career had been built on precision and control, yet tonight, he felt utterly powerless against this relentless foe that seemed to have seized hold of his very soul.
