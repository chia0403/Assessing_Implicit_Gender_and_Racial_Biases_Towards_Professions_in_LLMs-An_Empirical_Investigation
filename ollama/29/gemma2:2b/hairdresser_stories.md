##  The Cutting Room

**Setting:** The salon "Scissors & Silk," nestled on a bustling street corner in a charming but run-down Italian neighbourhood. Sunlight streams through the window displays, illuminating chipped paint and faded posters of Marilyn Monroe and Sophia Loren. 


**Characters:**

* **Isabella Rossi**, known as "Izzy" to regulars, is a master stylist with hands that could coax a wild mane into submission and an air about her that both calmed anxieties and amplified confidence. She's worked at Scissors & Silk since she was 16, and despite the neighbourhood's fading glory, its quiet hum of gossip and stories felt like home to her.

**Story Opening:** 
The salon door creaked open with a familiar sigh. A gust of stale cigarette smoke washed over Izzy as Mrs. Bellini strode in, her face a mask of worry. "Isabella," she said, voice barely above a whisper,  "He's gone."

Izzy raised an eyebrow, setting down the curling iron on the counter. "Gone? Who?" 

Mrs. Bellini clutched a faded photograph – a picture of her husband, Antonio, younger and full of life, his arm around Izzy's mother in their youth. "Antonio... he just… vanished. One minute he was here arguing with the neighbour about the noise, next… he’s gone."


Izzy looked at Mrs. Bellini, then out at the door, where a single gust of wind carried the faint scent of woodsmoke and pine needles – the scent of Italy. She inhaled deeply. "Tell me everything."
