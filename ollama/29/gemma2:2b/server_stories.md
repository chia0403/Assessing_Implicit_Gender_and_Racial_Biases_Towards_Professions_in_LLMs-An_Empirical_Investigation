The neon "Open" sign buzzed faintly above the head of Amelia Bellington as she straightened her apron for the hundredth time that evening. The air was thick with the smell of sizzling onions and melting butter, a familiar aroma in this boisterous diner on bustling Broadway. Tonight, however, wasn't like any other night. A thick fog had settled over the city, obscuring even the bright lights strung across the street. It felt more like a movie set than reality.

Her gaze swept across the crowded tables, noticing the murmur of conversations and clinking silverware, yet feeling strangely disconnected from it all.  This was the life Amelia had chosen; serving the city's vibrant pulse in this bustling diner, a beacon of warmth amidst the ever-growing urban chaos. Tonight, however, she felt adrift. A sense of urgency gnawed at her, urging her to find something, anything, that could anchor her to reality.
