## The World in His Pocket

**Setting:** A bustling but oddly quaint train station in the heart of Prague, Czechoslovakia.  Cobblestone streets meandered around the massive station building, with ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from Czech history illuminating the platforms. 

**Character:** Viktor Petrovich "Vik" Kozlov, a man whose name was almost as complicated and multi-layered as the maps he meticulously studied. A former history professor turned travel agent, Vik's worn leather satchel held more secrets than his neatly combed gray hair suggested.  His eyes, though usually twinkling with excitement at a new adventure, were dimmed with worry today.

Vik ran a gloved hand over his face and sighed. His world was about to shrink again. The train announcement was clear, the time for departure imminent. But instead of bustling tourists, he saw only the faces of confused families, their hopes for an idyllic European vacation tangled in anxieties. 

“Another one bites the dust,” Vik muttered under his breath, flipping through a folder labeled "Emergency Trips: Europe's Last Frontier." Each page was filled with meticulously researched travel itineraries to places most wouldn’t dare even dream about.  He felt a familiar pang of hope for these desperate souls – just like he had during his own years spent exploring uncharted lands. But this time, the weight of their uncertainty felt heavier than ever before.
