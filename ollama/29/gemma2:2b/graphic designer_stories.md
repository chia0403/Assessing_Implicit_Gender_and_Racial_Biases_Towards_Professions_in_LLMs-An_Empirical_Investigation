## Setting: 

A cramped, sun-drenched apartment in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood. Exposed brick walls meet faded floral wallpaper, a testament to the building's history as an old factory converted into artist studios. The scent of burnt coffee hangs heavy in the air, mingling with the aroma of jasmine tea from an unattended pot simmering on the stovetop. Sunlight spills onto the desk where Amelia (or Amy, as her friends called her) works, illuminating the dust motes swirling around a half-finished illustration project. 


## Opening:

Amy stared at the screen, frustration etching lines across her forehead. The latest client's brief -  a logo for a vegan food truck called "Green Dream Machine" - had been as vague as a dream itself. It needed a bold identity, something that reflected the fusion of organic and culinary innovation. But it also required a whimsical touch, a splash of vibrant color that could capture the spirit of the fast-paced world Amy lived in, yet also embody the calm serenity of nature. 

She rubbed her temples, wishing she had more to work with. This was a problem she faced more often than not as a graphic designer. The lines between real life and the digital realm seemed increasingly blurred.  The "Green Dream Machine" logo felt like an endless game of artistic Tetris, where each piece needed to fit perfectly yet still be unique. 

She let out a frustrated sigh, the screen flickering to reveal Amy’s latest attempt. A swirling vortex of greens and yellows, with barely discernible lettering resembling a child's scribble on a napkin. The result was less "Green Dream Machine" and more… “Amelia’s latest artistic meltdown.”  The pressure mounted as she envisioned her client - a vegan food truck owner named Beatrice who had poured her heart into creating this project – expecting something extraordinary from Amy.
