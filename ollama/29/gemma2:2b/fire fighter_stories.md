The salt air whipped through Finnigan O'Connell's hair as he adjusted his helmet, its worn visor reflecting the fiery orange glow of the late afternoon sun on the jagged cliffs of Cape Haven.  He was stationed just a few miles inland from that infamous coastline, where the ocean roared with an almost sentient fury at the rock formations. The air itself seemed to crackle with anticipation, charged with the raw energy that always preceded a storm. This wasn't your typical California breeze; this felt heavy, pregnant with the threat of something worse than just rain and wind. 

Finnigan stood on the edge of the fire station platform overlooking the churning sea, his boots planted firmly against the wooden planks as he surveyed the landscape.  He could almost taste the humidity in the air; a thick, cloying kind that clung to your throat like smoke. A low rumble echoed through the valley, then another, growing in volume with each passing moment. The storm was coming, and it wouldn't be long before those angry skies unleashed their fury on the unsuspecting town below.

Finnigan took a deep breath, the smell of salt and wet sand filling his lungs.  It had been ten years since he joined the fire department, ten years spent fighting against the flames that danced across the tinder-dry landscape, and tonight, it felt different. The storm wasn't just another day at the office; this was a reckoning, a dance with something ancient and powerful, something that whispered of forgotten magic in the wind.  His heart hammered against his ribs as he stared out at the horizon, ready to meet whatever awaited him on the precipice of the approaching tempest.
