The afternoon sun streamed through the dusty windowpanes of the manor house, casting long shadows on the worn floral carpets. Amelia Hawthorne, her sensible brown skirt creasing with every step as she navigated the intricate hallways, couldn't help but feel a twinge of melancholic nostalgia.

Her hands had spent years kneading dust into forgotten corners and polishing silver tarnished from years of neglect, but her heart still yearned for a life beyond the confines of these walls, beyond the endless cycle of cleaning and tending to the needs of its once-proud inhabitants.
