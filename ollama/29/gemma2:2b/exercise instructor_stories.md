## Setting: The Morning Fog 

**Opening:**

The morning air hung heavy with the remnants of last night's storm, thick with moisture and clinging to everything like an unwelcome ghost. The sun, barely peeking over the horizon, cast long, distorted shadows through the swirling mist that clung to the city streets below.  Inside "Peak Performance", a bustling fitness studio nestled on the edge of Brooklyn, Evelyn Reed, the renowned yoga instructor, surveyed her space. Sweat gleamed on her forehead, mirroring the tension in her usually calm eyes. 

**Evelyn's Name:** A familiar hum filled the room, punctuated by rhythmic breathing and the clinking of weights. She adjusted the microphone clipped to her tracksuit, a small frown creasing her brow as she glanced at the clock. It was almost time for her morning class. Her studio was usually bustling with eager faces, drawn in by her no-nonsense approach to fitness and the unique blend of traditional yoga techniques with contemporary workout methods.  

Today though, something felt off. The air hung thick with a tension that mirrored the swirling fog outside. Evelyn's heart pounded against her ribs, an unfamiliar feeling she couldn’t shake off.
