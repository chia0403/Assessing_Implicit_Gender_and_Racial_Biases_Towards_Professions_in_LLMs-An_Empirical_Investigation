Rain lashed against the glass windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic, blurring the already fading afternoon light into an abstract watercolor.  He stared at the swirling storm outside, trying to ignore the way it mirrored the turmoil within his own mind.  His gaze drifted towards the waiting room where a lone figure sat perched on a hard plastic chair. Mrs. Henderson, a young woman with eyes filled with unspoken fear and worry. 

Elias Thorne, physical therapist extraordinaire, was known for calming even the most panicked patient. But this time, the weight of Mrs. Henderson's situation seemed to press down like a stone on his chest, threatening to drown him in despair. He took a deep breath and leaned forward, ready to begin another chapter in his tireless fight against the crippling grip of arthritis that had stolen her joy of movement. The storm outside raged, but inside the clinic, Elias held onto a flickering ember of hope, ready to reignite Mrs. Henderson's spirit one step at a time.
