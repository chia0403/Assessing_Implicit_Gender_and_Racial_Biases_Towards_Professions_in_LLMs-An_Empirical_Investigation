The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Mr. Peterson's office, illuminating motes of dust that danced like tiny specters in the stale air. A lone file lay open on his desk – a seemingly innocuous case about a property dispute, but one that felt heavier than usual. Amelia "Amy" Finch, a paralegal with an appetite for justice and a nose for trouble, sat across from him, her fingers drumming impatiently against the worn leather of her chair. Mr. Peterson's weathered face, etched with years of countless legal battles won and lost, was grim.  

"I tell you," he muttered, his voice thick with frustration, "These people have more money than sense. Why else would they go to such lengths?" 

Amy leaned back, her eyes narrowed as she studied the case file. The details were a jumble – conflicting accounts of ownership, ambiguous boundaries, and the occasional whisper of an unspoken power play.  The air hung heavy with the weight of secrets, and Amy could feel it press down on her like a physical burden. It was a kind of secret that she had learned to read in the years she spent at Mr. Peterson's side – the sort that lurked beneath seemingly mundane cases, waiting for someone brave enough to unearth them. 

As if sensing her thoughts, Mr. Peterson sighed and tapped his worn finger on the file. "I just wish we had more than whispers."
