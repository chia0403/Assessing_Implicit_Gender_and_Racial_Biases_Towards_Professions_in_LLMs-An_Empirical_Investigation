The sun beat down on **Eamon "Mac" McTaggart**'s back, his neck creaking under the weight of another afternoon spent scaling the sprawling Victorian house with its intricate gables. The smell of cedar shingles and old paint hung heavy in the air, mingling with a faint aroma of brewing coffee from the chipped enamel cup he held in one calloused hand. His boots hammered rhythmically against the warped wooden planks as he worked his way up to the peak. 

This was Mac's life, rough and unforgiving like the wood he often used.  He wasn't just a roofer; he was a sculptor of dreams, bending metal, weaving wood, and building shelters for families who needed a safe haven from the world's harsh realities. Each roof he nailed down was an echo of his own past: a tapestry of stories woven from his childhood spent beneath the watchful gaze of the factory workers in his hometown.  His father had been a foreman, hands calloused by years of hard work and lips worn thin with worry. He'd taught him to respect the power of wood, its quiet strength, and the way it held the weight of the world on its own shoulders. 
The old house, however, was steeped in a different kind of history; one filled with secrets whispered by the creaking floorboards and shadows that lurked between the rafters.  It wasn't just the structure; it was the unspoken stories hidden within the walls, waiting to be revealed like buried treasures.  And tonight, as Mac surveyed his work, he felt a sense of anticipation gnaw at his heart - this was where his story would take a turn, and its pace would determine whether it rose to meet the storm or succumb to the winds of fate.
