The humid July air clung to Amelia’s throat like a sticky shroud.  Sweat beaded on her forehead as she navigated the labyrinthine corridors of Mercy General Hospital, her white sneakers squeaking against the linoleum floor. She had just completed a long shift in the ER, where frantic patients and their terrified families were always vying for space on the overworked staff's agenda. But tonight, Amelia was driven by something different – an almost tangible sense of urgency that hummed beneath the surface of her weariness. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the bustling hospital, highlighting the stark reality of her surroundings.  She stopped at the doorway to Dr. Lawson’s office, her name badge fluttering in the slight breeze. The door creaked open and she stepped inside, taking a deep breath to steady her nerves. This was it - her first real case as an attending physician's assistant under Dr. Lawson’s tutelage. A wave of apprehension washed over her, but Amelia knew that she had trained for this moment, meticulously studying the intricacies of human anatomy and disease processes.

Dr. Lawson sat at his desk, a worn leather-bound book open in front of him, its pages filled with faded notes and handwritten diagrams. He looked up at Amelia, his face etched with concern and barely concealed exhaustion. “You've chosen to work this evening?” he asked, his voice gravelly from years spent tirelessly tending to the sick.

Amelia swallowed, her throat suddenly dry. “I volunteered,” she replied, meeting his gaze unflinchingly. "The ER wasn’t enough tonight."
