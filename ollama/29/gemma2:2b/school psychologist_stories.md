Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek High's counseling center, mimicking the tumult inside Dr. Evelyn Thorne's head.  The usual silence of the room was broken only by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her pen against her notes and the distant murmurings of teenage angst from the hallway. The storm outside felt like a reflection of the chaos she saw swirling within each student who walked through her door: anxiety, anger, grief...all tangled together like a knot in their very souls. 

Today was particularly grim. She'd been dealing with Leo Miller, a freshman with a reputation for keeping to himself and an even greater tendency to snap at any sign of interaction.  He sat hunched in the corner seat of her office, arms crossed, his face buried in his hands. The faint scent of stale cigarettes hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the turmoil swirling beneath the surface. Evelyn knew Leoâ€™s silence was more than just teenage awkwardness - it held the weight of unspoken battles and anxieties, the kind that could easily overwhelm even the strongest souls.
