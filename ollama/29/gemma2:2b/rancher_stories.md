Its relentless howl seemed to echo the discontent swirling within Jeremiah "Jeb" Hale's gut as he surveyed his cattle herd from the worn wooden porch of his ranch house. The once-proud herd had dwindled under the unforgiving sun and biting cold, their sleek bodies now emaciated husks against the backdrop of a sky the color of bruised plums.

The once-bustling ranch was slowly dying, succumbing to droughts that seemed like they would last for eternity. His forefathers had built it on this land, their legacy now clinging precariously to the brink of collapse. It was time for Jeb to make a decision, one that felt heavier than the leaden weight settling in his chest.  He looked out at the barren landscape, a single tear escaping down his leathery cheek before being swept away by the relentless wind. This place, this family legacy, it all hung in the balance.
