Rain hammered against the grimy windows of "The Rusty Compass," each drop exploding with a miniature burst of light from within.  Inside, the air hung thick and smoky, smelling of stale beer, cheap perfume, and desperation. It was a haven for lost souls, runaways, and heartbroken dreamers - all united by the same shared truth: escape often came at a price. 

Behind the counter, Ezra Thorne wiped down his latest casualty - a chipped glass he’d used to pour out another round of "Bluebird's Tears," a concoction known for its potent pain-inducing properties. He was young, lean, with eyes the color of seafoam and a face weathered by too many late nights and too few sunny days. His name was whispered in hushed tones among regulars: Ezra “The Fixer" Thorne. Some called him a saint, others a demon. 

He sighed as he glanced out at the rain-slicked street.  Tonight's storms weren’t just about weather; they were an echo of the turmoil churning inside him. The usual rush of customers had dwindled to only one: Mrs. O’Malley, whose wrinkled face held a flicker of sadness that mirrored his own. Ezra knew she needed something more than whiskey tonight. And he was determined to give it to her, however rough or twisted his path to do so might be.
