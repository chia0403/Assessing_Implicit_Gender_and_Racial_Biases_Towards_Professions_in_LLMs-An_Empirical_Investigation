The fluorescent hum was as familiar to Amelia "Amy" Davies as her own heartbeat.  Every morning, it pulsed through the sterile air of Starlite Grocery, resonating with the rhythmic clinking of cans and the soft sigh of machinery as the automatic doors opened and closed like tired eyelids. 7:00 am sharp, Amy's shift began, a routine she’d perfected in four years of working at this corner store nestled between an auto shop and a laundromat.  The world outside was a kaleidoscope of colors – from the fiery sunrise to the bustling rush hour commuters – but inside Starlite, everything blended into a muted grey, punctuated by the occasional squawk of the oversized bird perched on the ceiling fan's light fixture, its shadow a fleeting dance across Amy's tired eyes. 


Tonight was different.  A thick fog had rolled in from the ocean, clinging to the town like a melancholic shroud. The usual quiet hum of the store was replaced with an eerie stillness, punctuated only by the distant sound of the ferry crossing the bay. A strange unease settled over Amy as she scanned the line at her register: each customer seemed more anxious than the last, their faces etched with worry and uncertainty.
