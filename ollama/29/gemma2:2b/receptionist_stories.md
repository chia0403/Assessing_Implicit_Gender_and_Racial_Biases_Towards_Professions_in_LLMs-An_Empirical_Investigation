Rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of The Grand Oak Hotel, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of the storm. Inside,  Amelia "Amy" Hayes, with her neatly styled auburn bob and perpetually cheerful demeanor, meticulously polished the reception desk – a mahogany masterpiece that gleamed under the soft glow of the lamps. Each guest’s arrival felt like an unfurling of a grand symphony; the air thick with anticipation and secrets waiting to be whispered. 

Today, however, the atmosphere was heavy with something else: a creeping unease that had settled over The Grand Oak like a shroud.  The usual jovial buzz of check-ins had been replaced by hushed whispers and furrowed brows. Even the elegant floral arrangements – normally a beacon of hope in this usually bustling place - seemed wilted and forlorn under the gloomy stormlights. 


Amy sighed, her gaze lingering on the door marked "Mr. Hawthorne's Suite."  The man himself was notorious for his eccentricities, known as much for his breathtaking philanthropy as for his uncanny ability to make disappear any unwanted guests... or maybe even their memories entirely. Today, he was late, and that usually didn't bode well.
