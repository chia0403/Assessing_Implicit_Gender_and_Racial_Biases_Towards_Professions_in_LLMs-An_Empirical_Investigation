The wind whipped across Elara Blackwood's face as she stooped over the wilted sunflowers, her gnarled hands brushing against their brittle stalks.  Sunlight, already fading into the dusky hues of early autumn, cast long shadows on the parched fields of Blackwood Farm. The air hung heavy with the smell of dry earth and distant rain, a cruel promise that seemed to mock Elara's weary heart. She sighed, her breath escaping in a puff of dust like an aged soul resigned to its fate. 

Elara was a farmer through and through.  Her ancestors had tilled this land for generations, carving their lives into the earth's very being. The furrows that snaked across her father's worn-down fields were etched deep in her memory; a map of hardship and triumph she could recall even in her sleep. Yet tonight, Elara felt adrift. The drought had stretched on relentlessly for months, turning fertile ground to parched dust and silencing the vibrant chorus of life her land once held. Her heart ached with a familiar ache â€“ a longing not just for rain, but for the ease of normalcy she couldn't quite grasp anymore. 

It was more than just the crops that were wilting; it was a loss of faith in this land that had sustained her family through thick and thin.  And as Elara turned away from the sunflowers, a single teardrop splashed down her cheek like a stray raindrop in the dry soil.
