The air hung thick and humid over Coral Gables, even at dawn. A gentle breeze rustled the fronds of palm trees lining Miracle Mile, swaying in time with the rhythmic thrum of the streetcars rumbling past.  This was Amelia "Amy" Thorne's playground - a city where history whispered from every corner, reflected in the pastel-colored facades and Art Deco architecture. But this morning, Amy felt anything but playful. The familiar charm of Coral Gables couldn't mask the cold dread settling in her stomach. 

Today was the closing for the "Grand Duchess," as it had been dubbed - a sprawling estate on Seville Way, rumored to be haunted since its owner, a reclusive millionaire philanthropist named Bartholomew Thorne (Amy's great-grandfather), died mysteriously within its walls decades ago.  As she stared at the grand Spanish Colonial mansion bathed in the golden light of dawn, Amy couldn't shake off the uneasy feeling that the whispers were about to become real.
