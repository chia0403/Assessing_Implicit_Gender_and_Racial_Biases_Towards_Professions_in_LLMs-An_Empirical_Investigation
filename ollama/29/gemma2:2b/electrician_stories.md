The air hung thick with humidity, the kind that clung to everything like a second skin.  Dust motes danced in the single ray of sunlight piercing through the grimy attic door, illuminating the chaotic jumble of wires and tools spread across the floorboards.  This was no ordinary workshop; this was Elias Thorne's domain, his sanctuary, where the hum of electricity pulsed like a heartbeat against the silence of an old Victorian house. 

His calloused hand tightened around a screwdriver as he meticulously inspected a corroded junction box, its metallic skin stained with years of neglect.  Elias Thorne, a man forged in the fires of countless electrical storms and circuits both mundane and arcane, was known for his unorthodox methods - a symphony of sparks and sine waves, a dance of voltage and current that only he understood. 
His journey had started under the tutelage of his grandfather, a seasoned electrician who passed on more than just the art of rewiring homes; he taught him the silent language of wires, the stories they whispered before each spark ignited them to life.  Today, however, Elias felt a nagging sense of unease in the air, an unsettling premonition that this seemingly simple job was anything but ordinary.

The faint hum of electricity, usually soothing and comforting, seemed distorted today, like a discordant note in an otherwise perfectly tuned orchestra. A shiver ran down his spine as he caught a glimpse of something strange flickering within the box - a tiny, pulsating light unlike any he'd seen before. 
Something was off, terribly off.  He couldn't shake this feeling; it was like a knot tightening around his heart with every passing second.
