Rain lashed against the bakery window, blurring the pastel-colored lettering that read “Le Papillon.” Inside, Amelia Stormey, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun to keep it away from her face smeared with chocolate frosting, wiped down the counter one last time. This was her usual ritual before she started her day of calls and paperwork – a small act of calm amidst the chaos that seemed to be the lifeblood of the insurance world. 

Amelia sighed.  She couldn't help but feel a pang of resentment at the storm raging outside, mirroring the tempest within her own heart. It had been five years since she started working for The Phoenix Group – five years of long hours, endless paperwork, and a clientele that seemed to grow increasingly impatient with Amelia’s dedication to finding the perfect coverage for every situation. 

The phone on the wall buzzed as another call came in. “Amelia Stormey at your service,” she said into the receiver, her voice calm but laced with fatigue. The voice on the other end spoke of a recent house fire and the owner’s despair.  It was just another day in the life of an insurance agent, one that Amelia was desperately hoping to escape someday.
