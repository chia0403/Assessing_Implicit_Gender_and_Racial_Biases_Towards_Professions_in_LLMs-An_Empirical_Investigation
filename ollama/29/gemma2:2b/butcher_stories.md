The scent of woodsmoke and iron hung heavy in the air over Oldtown's bustling marketplace.  Sunlight spilled through the gap in the awnings overhead, painting the cobblestones in an oily glow, while a symphony of bartering filled the space - squeaky boots, the clanging of copper pots, a merchant hawking his wares with a boisterous voice. Among the throng, however, stood Bartholomew "Barty" Hemlock, hunched over his butcher shop, the rhythmic clang of cleavers against meat a constant background melody to his thoughts.  

Barty’s workshop was less a space and more an extension of his very being.  Wooden boards were worn smooth by years of practice, and tools hung from hooks as familiar as the lines on his own face. The meat racks groaned under the weight of daily offerings – plump ham hams, gleaming steaks, carcasses of deer with eyes that seemed to follow you – each one a story whispered in the silence of the shop. But today, even the usual symphony of animal life couldn’t drown out the hum of worry in Barty's ears.
