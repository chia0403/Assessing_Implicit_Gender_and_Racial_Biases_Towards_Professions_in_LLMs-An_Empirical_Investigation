Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of The Signal Shack, each drop drumming out a frantic rhythm against the worn tin sheets.  Inside, amidst the static buzz and the tangle of wires that seemed to writhe like serpents on their metal frames, sat Elias Thorne, his long fingers deftly manipulating the dials of a vintage radio receiver. His name was a misnomer â€“ he wasn't born with it; instead, it clung to him like the dust coating the old equipment.  It was what they called him when he was young - "Thorne," just another boy lost in the clatter and hum of radio waves, before he became Elias Thorne, The Signal Weaver.

The year was 1958, a time of roaring radios, whispered codes and clandestine conversations across continents. But even in that era's whirlwind of technical advancement, there was something about this old shack on the edge of town - something almost mythical.  It held secrets as intricate as the crackling radio waves, secrets that Elias had sworn to guard with his life. Tonight, though, the silence felt heavy, punctuated only by the howling wind and a low hum from his own heart.
