The whirring of machinery was the soundtrack to Elara Swift's life. For years, she’d navigated the labyrinthine hallways of the Darrow Industries steelworks, her trusty tape measure in hand, meticulously charting the contours of each sprawling blueprint. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of welding fumes and a persistent quiet hum that permeated every corner. Elara, a master draftsman with calloused hands and eyes as sharp as the edges of her drafting tools, had spent years building a life within these steel walls. 

Her current project – the ambitious expansion of the Darrow Industries' processing plant – was one she’d poured her heart into. It promised to be her magnum opus, a testament to her dedication and skill. However, even as Elara meticulously plotted out the intricate design for the plant's new furnace section, a gnawing unease started to settle in her stomach. Something felt…off. The silence, usually a comforting presence, now hummed with an unsettling energy she couldn't quite place.
