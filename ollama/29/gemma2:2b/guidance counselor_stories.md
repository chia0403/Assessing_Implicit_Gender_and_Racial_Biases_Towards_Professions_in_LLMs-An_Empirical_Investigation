The fluorescent hum of Northridge High's office was as persistent as a bad dream.  Ms. Eleanor Cartwright, her heart heavy with yesterday's dismissal, stared out the window. The late-October sky was bruised purple and streaked with streaks of rain that mirrored the tension within her. Her first year at Northridge had been...unforgettable, to say the least.

**Setting:** A bustling public high school in a sleepy suburban town on the outskirts of Portland, Oregon.

**Character:** 

* **Ms. Eleanor Cartwright:**  A young guidance counselor with a heart as big as her ever-growing stack of folders labeled "Senior Year" and "College Applications."  But unlike the students who flock to her for academic or career advice, she's struggling to find her own path in life. 


**Opening lines (in which Ms. Cartwright might be talking about her frustration):**

* "It feels like every time I turn around, it's another crisis waiting to happen."  Eleanor sighed, running a tired hand through her auburn hair. The weight of the students' woes seemed to press down on her more than usual today.
* "I swear, this place is filled with walking disasters disguised as teenagers." she muttered, pushing a stray curl back behind her ear before looking out the window at the swirling rain and dark clouds. 


This opening sets up the story by introducing a key conflict: Ms. Cartwright's frustration with the studentsâ€™ anxieties. The setting helps to establish the overall tone - it is a place of high-pressure decisions, teenage drama, and uncertain futures. The introduction of Eleanor adds depth as we learn about her own struggles and journey.
