## The Last Ember 

**Setting:** A crumbling lighthouse on the craggy cliffs of Cornwall, England. Stormy waves crashed against the stone facade, echoing with the mournful cry of gulls circling above. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the kitchen, obscuring the vibrant hues of the sea beyond.

**Main character:**  Finnian "Finn" O'Malley, a man whose hands were as calloused as the rugged coast he called home. Once a celebrated chef in London, he now stood alone, his soul scarred by a recent tragedy and his culinary fire extinguished by grief. Finn's name was synonymous with fiery passion in the kitchens of fine restaurants but now, only the embers of that flame flickered within him, fueling him to keep going - to rebuild his life before it crumbled entirely. 

Finn ran a hand over his salt-and-pepper hair, tracing the faint scar etched onto his forehead like a permanent reminder of his past mistakes. The weight of losing his wife, Iris, was a crushing anchor around his chest, pulling him under with every gust of wind that swept through the lighthouse kitchen. She had been his muse, his confidante, and the soul of their vibrant life; her absence left him adrift in a sea of solitude.

He stood at the hearth, surrounded by chipped plates and rusted cooking utensils - relics of a past life he could barely remember. The only source of warmth came from the ancient stove's flickering flames, casting long shadows across his weary face. His heart throbbed with memories; Iris, stirring fragrant spices, laughter echoing through their tiny kitchen. Each sound, each scent brought him back to her, leaving him wanting more than a mere echo of her presence.

Tonight, he was tasked with preparing the lighthouse keeper's son's birthday dinner - a gruff man who viewed Finn as another ghost from the old life. He had never quite recovered after losing his wife; but tonight, he would have to summon all the strength he possessed and bring back the spark within him for one solitary meal.
