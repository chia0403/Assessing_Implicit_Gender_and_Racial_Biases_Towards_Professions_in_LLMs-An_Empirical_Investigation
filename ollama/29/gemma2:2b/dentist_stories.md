The worn leather creaked as Dr. Alistair Thorne adjusted his glasses, their metal frames catching the golden light filtering through the stained glass window. A chill ran down his spine despite the warmth radiating from his office's crackling fireplace. Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the tempest brewing within him. His practice was normally a haven of order and predictable routine - a world away from the chaos raging outside - but today, it felt like an echoing chamber of forgotten anxieties. 

Alistair’s patient was supposed to be young and carefree – a recent dental school graduate eager to start his career in a bustling metropolis.  But the last few hours had been anything but. The news flashed on a flickering screen nearby, each headline a jarring reminder of the city's escalating unrest. Whispers of riots, shortages, and dwindling resources had crept into his once-tranquil office like the wind whistling through the broken windowpanes.  His hands trembled slightly as he reached for his medical kit, a familiar weight in his palm that offered only temporary solace.
