The crisp autumn air bit at Elara Evelyn Thorne's cheeks as she stepped out of her car. Maple leaves, fiery red and gold, swirled around her ankles like miniature dancers, while a lone crow called mournfully from a branch overhead. The clinic was nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a sleepy town nestled between rolling hills and dense woodland.  

Elara inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filling her lungs. It wasn't always this peaceful. In the city, where she'd spent the first ten years of her career, noise was a constant companion, a relentless hum that grated on her nerves. Here, in Havenwood, silence reigned, broken only by the rustling of wind through the trees and the distant murmur of the river. It was a stark contrast to her previous life, but Elara found solace in it.  

As she unlocked the door to "Thorne's Rehabilitation," her heart filled with a familiar sense of purpose. This wasn't just a job; it was her calling. Helping people regain their strength, their mobility, their lives - that was what fueled her. And Havenwood, with its charming inhabitants and quiet resilience, seemed the perfect place to make a difference.
