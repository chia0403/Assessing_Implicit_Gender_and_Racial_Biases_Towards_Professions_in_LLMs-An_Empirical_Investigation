The air hung heavy with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine, a familiar perfume to Elara Seraphina Blackwood. She stood before her canvas, a riot of vibrant colours already splashed across its surface, but still feeling strangely empty. The setting sun cast long shadows through the dusty windows of her studio, turning the cluttered space into an ethereal labyrinth of paint tubes, brushes, and half-finished masterpieces.  

Elara was a whirlwind of creativity – bold strokes, fiery hues, and an unnerving ability to capture the fleeting essence of a moment on canvas. Yet, today, inspiration seemed as elusive as a butterfly in a hurricane. The city outside her studio window, normally a vibrant tapestry of life, felt muted, distant. Even the rhythmic hum of traffic, usually a comforting soundtrack to her work, was now an intrusive drone. 


What Elara didn't know was that this creative drought was about to be shattered by a knock on the door – a knock that would change everything.
