The air in the ER hummed with a symphony of beeps, coughs, and hushed pleas. A thin layer of antiseptic clung to everything, mixing with the metallic tang of blood that always seemed to linger somewhere in the background.  Eleanor Grace O'Malley, or Ellie as everyone called her, maneuvered through the chaos with practiced ease. Her scrubs were stained with something she didn't want to identify - a mixture of sweat, vomit, and likely a touch of blood. It was just another Tuesday night in the ER at St. Jude's Hospital in Detroit. A city where hope lived in crowded corners and heartbreak echoed down abandoned alleys, Ellie had seen it all. Tonight, however, felt different. The air crackled with an unsettling energy, like the storm brewing outside mirrored something deeper within the walls of the hospital itself. 


As Ellie reached for a fresh set of gloves, a frantic young doctor rushed past her, his face pale and etched with urgency. "We need all hands on deck! Trauma three, multiple gunshot wounds," he yelled over the din.  Ellie felt a familiar surge of adrenaline, her years of experience kicking in. This wasn't just another Tuesday night anymore.
