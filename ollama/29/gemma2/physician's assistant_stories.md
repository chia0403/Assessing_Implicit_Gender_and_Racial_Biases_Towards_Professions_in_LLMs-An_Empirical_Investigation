The air in the ER was thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear.  Lilac Moonbeam, her scrubs pressed crisp despite the chaos swirling around her, worked tirelessly amidst the symphony of beeping monitors and panicked cries. 

It was always like this at Mercy General on a Friday night - the culmination of a week's worth of stress spilling over into the wee hours. Tonight, though, felt different. A tension hung in the air, heavier than usual, as if everyone knew something was brewing, something beyond the usual influx of drunken brawls and weekend-induced maladies.  Lilac glanced at Dr. Ramirez, her supervising physician, his brow furrowed as he barked orders into his headset. He looked strained, like a tightrope walker one gust of wind away from plummeting. 

Her gaze drifted towards the new patient being wheeled in - a young man, pale and unconscious, slumped against a gurney. The EMTs didn't speak, their faces grim as they placed him on a bed. Lilac felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine. This wasnâ€™t just another Friday night incident. This was something else entirely.  


The clock ticked past midnight, the ER lights reflecting in Lilac's worried eyes. Whatever storm was brewing tonight, she knew it had only just begun.
