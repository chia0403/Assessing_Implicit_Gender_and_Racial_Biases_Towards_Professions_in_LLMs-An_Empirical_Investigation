The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Brightwell's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of numbered chairs lining the waiting room. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and nervous sweat, a familiar aroma in Amy's world. She idly tapped her foot against the linoleum floor, waiting for Mrs. Henderson to finish filling out her paperwork. 

It was a typical Tuesday morning at St. Jude's Community Clinic, the bustling heart of a small town where everyone knew each other and their medical history. Amy, with her gentle touch and knack for soothing even the most anxious patients, was a pillar in this community.  


But today, something felt different. A knot of unease tightened in Amyâ€™s stomach. It wasn't Mrs. Henderson's usual trepidation about needles; it was the lingering scent of ozone she detected just beyond the faint hum of fluorescent lights. And a whisper, like a breeze through dry leaves, that seemed to say, "She's not who you think she is."
