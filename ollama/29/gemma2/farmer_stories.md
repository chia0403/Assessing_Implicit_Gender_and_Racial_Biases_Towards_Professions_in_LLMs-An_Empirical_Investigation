The sun, already a fiery orb in the haze-streaked sky, beat down on Elias Blackwood's weathered back as he wrestled a stubborn bale of hay into place. Sweat stung his eyes, but he didn't dare wipe it away, not with the morning’s work barely begun.  His small farm nestled in the crook of a valley in rural Oregon, was a symphony of green and gold – emerald fields stretching towards distant hills, punctuated by patches of sunflower stalks reaching for the sun. A gentle breeze carried the scent of dew-kissed alfalfa and freshly turned soil, a familiar perfume that had been Elias’s constant companion since he was a boy. 

He glanced at his ramshackle farmhouse, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. It wasn't much, but it held his memories – the echo of laughter from family dinners, the creak of floorboards under his children’s feet, and the silent weight of their absence now. The farm was all that remained, a legacy he desperately clung to despite the whispers of hardship swirling around him like dust devils in the summer wind.
