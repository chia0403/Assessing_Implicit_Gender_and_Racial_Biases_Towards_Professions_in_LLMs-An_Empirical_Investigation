The greasy spoon diner smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma to Elias Thorne, Probation Officer for District 37.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign. Inside, steam curled from mugs in the hands of weary truckers and insomniacs, their faces illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights. Elias sat hunched over a lukewarm cup of tea, watching the door with a practiced eye.  He was waiting for Lily Quinn, a young woman on probation for shoplifting, whose weekly check-ins always felt like walking into a storm cloud. Her past offenses were minor, but there was a flicker in her eyes, a restlessness that made Elias uneasy. He knew she wasn't just stealing things; she was stealing time, running from something deeper he couldn't quite grasp.  

Tonight, the storm seemed particularly turbulent.
