The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Rusty Nail like a thousand tiny hammers driven by an angry deity. Inside, smoke from stale cigarettes hung thick in the air, mingling with the scent of spilled beer and desperation. Elara Beatrice Finch, her auburn hair plastered to her forehead and her trench coat dripping onto the worn linoleum floor, hunched over a chipped mug of lukewarm coffee. She was ignoring the raucous laughter coming from the corner booth where a group of sailors were sharing stories - stories that probably weren't true, but Elara knew better than to trust anything in this town. 

The Rusty Nail, perched precariously on the edge of Saltwind Bay, wasn't known for its high-class clientele or accurate information. It was, however, a prime source for whispered rumours and half-truths, the kind that Elara, a freelance journalist with an insatiable thirst for the unknown, lived for. 


Tonight, she was hunting for something specific: a lead on the disappearance of Captain Alistair Blackwood, the town's most celebrated - and controversial - fisherman. His boat, the Sea Serpent, had vanished without a trace three days ago, leaving behind only an empty slip and a growing wave of fear among the townsfolk. Elara wasn't convinced it was just another case of bad weather or rogue waves.  Something felt off, something darker lurking beneath the surface of Saltwind Bay. And she intended to find out what it was.
