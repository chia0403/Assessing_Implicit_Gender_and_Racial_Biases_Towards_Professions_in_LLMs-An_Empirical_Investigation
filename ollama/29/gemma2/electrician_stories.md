The greasy tang of burnt wiring filled the air as  Eleanor “Ellie” Hayes wrestled with the junction box in the attic.

A symphony of creaks and groans serenaded her from the aging bones of the Victorian house, each groan a testament to its stubborn refusal to die gracefully. 

Ellie cursed under her breath,  her braid snaking down her back as she strained against the rusted screws holding the box together. This old lady wasn’t going down easy.

The beam of her headlamp flickered wildly, casting long, dancing shadows across the dusty floorboards.  Ellie gripped her toolbox tighter, her pulse quickening with a mix of fear and morbid fascination. Whatever was in this attic, it had just woken up.
