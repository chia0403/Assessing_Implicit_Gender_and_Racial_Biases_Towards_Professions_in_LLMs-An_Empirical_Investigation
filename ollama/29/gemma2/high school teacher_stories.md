The fluorescent lights hummed above Ms. Eloise Beaumont's head like a hive of discontent bees, buzzing in rhythm with her growing headache.  Her worn copy of "Hamlet" lay open on her desk, but the words swam before her eyes. Outside, the familiar roar of traffic and shouts from the schoolyard filtered through the thin windows of her classroom at Northwood High. It was the first day back after summer break, a symphony of teenage chaos about to unfold. Eloise sighed, trying to ignore the nagging feeling that this year would be different, somehow. 

Northwood, nestled in a sprawling suburb on the outskirts of Chicago, had always been a place where expectations were clear: get good grades, go to college, and fit into one of the neatly defined boxes society offered.  But something felt off this year, like a current running beneath the surface of normalcy, a tremor that hinted at upheaval. Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that she was about to be swept away by it.
