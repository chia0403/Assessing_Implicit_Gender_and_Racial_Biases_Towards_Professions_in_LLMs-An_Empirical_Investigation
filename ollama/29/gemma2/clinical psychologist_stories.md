The insistent chirping of his phone pulled Dr. Elias Vance from his reverie. He glanced at the screen, scowling at the unfamiliar number flashing across it. Patients called during office hours, not at 7:30 on a Saturday morning. He swiped to decline, sinking further into the worn armchair by the fireplace in his sunroom. 

The room was bathed in the warm glow of a rising summer sun, filtering through lace curtains onto the faded floral rug beneath his feet. A steaming mug of herbal tea sat untouched on the small table beside him, its steam mingling with the scent of honeysuckle wafting in from the garden outside. Elias had planned this morning for peace and quiet â€“ a rare commodity for someone whose profession demanded they delve into the darkest corners of the human psyche.

He took a long sip of his tea, savoring its earthy bitterness before returning his gaze to the book resting on his lap, "The Interpretation of Dreams" by Sigmund Freud.  Elias had always been drawn to understanding the complexities of the human mind, but lately, it felt more like wading through a labyrinth with no exit in sight. His patients were increasingly troubled, their anxieties amplified by an invisible storm brewing beneath the surface of society. 


This morning, he'd dreamt of a sky bleeding crimson, the ground beneath his feet crumbling into dust. He shook off the lingering unease and hoped for a day filled with less turbulence, both internally and externally. Little did he know, that phone call would shatter the fragile peace he had so desperately craved.
