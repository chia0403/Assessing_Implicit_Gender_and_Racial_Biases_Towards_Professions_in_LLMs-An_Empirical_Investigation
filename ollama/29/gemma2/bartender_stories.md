The air in The Rusty Mug was thick with the scent of stale beer, regret, and cheap perfume.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon sign outside that flickered erratically between "Open" and "Closed." Elara Juniper adjusted her worn-leather apron, sighing as a familiar ache pulsed through her hip. It was one of those nights where every patron seemed to carry their burdens a little heavier, their problems a little bigger.  Elara had learned to read them like open books â€“ the twitching lip of a man nursing his third whiskey, the strained laugh of a woman on a bad date, the hollow eyes of someone seeking oblivion in a glass.

She took a swig from her own half-empty bottle of gin hidden behind the counter, trying to ignore the prickling sensation that always accompanied these nights.  Elara Juniper, master mixologist and resident therapist of The Rusty Mug.
