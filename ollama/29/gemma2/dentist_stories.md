The humid Florida air hung thick with the scent of sunscreen and salt as Dr. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne pulled into her driveway. Her white Ford Focus, affectionately nicknamed "The Drill," groaned in protest against the sweltering heat, its AC struggling to keep up.  Amelia sighed, wiping the sweat from her brow before exiting the car.

Her small dental practice, nestled on a quiet street just a block from the sparkling turquoise waters of the Gulf of Mexico, was Ameliaâ€™s sanctuary. Away from the pressures of life in bustling Tampa Bay, she found solace in the gentle hum of the drills and the familiar routine of helping people care for their smiles.  The sun-bleached wood siding and vibrant bougainvillea vines that climbed up the porch steps gave it a charming, almost tropical feel. 


Amelia took a deep breath, inhaling the salty air mingled with the sweet fragrance of honeysuckle blooming on the trellis beside her front door. This was her haven, a place where anxieties dissolved and she could focus on the simple act of healing, one tooth at a time.
