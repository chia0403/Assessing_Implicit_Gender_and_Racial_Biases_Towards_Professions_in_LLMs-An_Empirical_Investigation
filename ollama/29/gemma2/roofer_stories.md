The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Cartwright's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat plastered his brown hair to his forehead, each bead a tiny mirror reflecting the shimmering expanse of downtown Chicago. He gripped the rusted nail gun tighter, its weight a familiar comfort against the dizzying height. 

Eli perched precariously on the rooftop of the old Sears building, one hand gripping a coil of tar paper as he surveyed the sprawling cityscape. The wind whipped his worn denim jacket around him, carrying with it the cacophony of city life: car horns blaring, distant sirens wailing, and the rhythmic hammering of construction sites echoing across the valley below. 

Eli loved this view. From up here, Chicago felt alive, a pulsating organism breathing under the summer sun. It was a far cry from the cramped, dusty apartment he shared with his brother in Pilsen, but it offered a certain freedom, a sense of detachment from the struggles that seemed to cling to him like cobwebs. Up here, he could lose himself in the rhythm of the work, the physical labor grounding him against the tide of uncertainty that threatened to pull him under.
