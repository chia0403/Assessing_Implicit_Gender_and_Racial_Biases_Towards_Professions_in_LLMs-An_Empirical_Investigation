Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the turmoil brewing in Elias "Eli" Thorne's gut. The flickering neon sign outside his office cast a sickly yellow glow across the cluttered desk: "Thorne Investigations - No Case Too Small, No Secret Too Deep."  He wasn't sure which part of that motto was more ironic tonight. 

The dingy alley behind his second-story office in Baltimore's less savory Inner Harbor was alive with the hiss and roar of the downpour. Streetlights cast elongated shadows, dancing to the rhythm of wind whipping through the narrow space. A lone dumpster overflowed with refuse, its contents threatening to spill into the slick cobblestones.  Eli ran a hand through his already disheveled hair, trying to ignore the damp chill that seeped into his bones. He was running out of time, and this case – a missing person plea from a woman named Amelia Vance – was starting to feel like it was pulling him under.
