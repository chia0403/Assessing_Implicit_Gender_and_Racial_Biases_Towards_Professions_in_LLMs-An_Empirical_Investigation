The flickering neon sign outside the "Lucky Clover" diner cast an oily sheen across Amelia Rose Hawthorne's rain-soaked scrubs as she hunched over her steaming coffee.  A symphony of sirens wailed in the distance, a familiar lullaby to her ears. She was on call tonight, a responsibility that came with the territory of being the only EMT in Harmony Ridge, a town where "emergency" often meant a sprained ankle from hiking or a particularly bad batch of homemade pie.

Harmony Ridge itself was a tapestry of faded Americana: weathered wooden houses lining dusty roads, a general store where time seemed to stand still, and a diner that smelled perpetually of bacon and regret. The kind of place where everyone knew your name, even if you only visited once every few months for the all-you-can-eat breakfast buffet. 

Amelia, a petite woman with fiery red hair always threatening to escape its braid, took a long sip of her coffee, the bitterness grounding her in this moment of preemptive chaos. The radio crackled to life, a dispatcher's voice cutting through the diner's low hum: "Hawthorne, we have a possible cardiac arrest at Maplewood Manor. ETA five minutes." 

Amelia slammed her mug down, adrenaline already coursing through her veins. She was on duty, and Harmony Ridge, however quaint, needed her. Tonight would be no exception.
