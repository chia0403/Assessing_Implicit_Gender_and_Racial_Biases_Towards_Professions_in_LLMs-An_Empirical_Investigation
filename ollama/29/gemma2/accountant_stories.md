The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head, casting an anemic glow over the rows upon rows of spreadsheets on her computer screen. Outside her window, the San Francisco skyline was shrouded in a perpetual haze of fog, mirroring the dull ache in Amelia’s chest. Every number she crunched felt like another brick in the wall separating her from the life she craved – one filled with vibrant colors, spontaneous adventures, and maybe even a touch of romance. Instead, she was tethered to this cubicle, drowning in receipts and tax forms, her soul as dry as last month’s balance sheet. 


Amelia sighed, rubbing her tired eyes.  Another Friday night spent surrounded by calculators and the faint scent of stale coffee. A life that wouldn't make even a single column on her "dreams" spreadsheet. She glanced at the clock: 5:02 pm. Just two minutes until she could escape this purgatory.  But tonight, something felt different. As if a storm was brewing both outside and within.
