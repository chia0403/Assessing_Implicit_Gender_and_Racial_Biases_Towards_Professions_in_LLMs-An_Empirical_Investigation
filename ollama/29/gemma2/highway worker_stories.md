The sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat slicked his forehead, stinging his eyes as he squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him. Mile after mile, it snaked through the Arizona desert, a concrete artery pumping the lifeblood of commerce across the country. Elias, with his faded orange vest and battered work gloves, was one of the unsung heroes keeping this vital flow moving. 

He stood beside the worn-down pickup truck, its paint peeling like sunburned skin, a testament to years spent battling sandstorms and searing heat. A half-eaten granola bar sat on the passenger seat, its contents slowly hardening in the blistering air.  Elias sighed, taking a swig from his canteen â€“ tepid water that tasted vaguely of dust. The desert stretched out around him, an undulating expanse of ochre and brown, punctuated by the occasional stunted Joshua tree clawing at the sky like a desperate beggar. Even the wind seemed to carry a whisper of despair, sighing through the scrub brush with a mournful howl.  


It was another scorcher in the Mojave. Another day patching cracks, clearing debris, fighting the relentless tide of dust that threatened to swallow everything whole. Elias Thorne, highway worker extraordinaire, wasn't one for complaining. He just kept his head down, his work boots firmly planted on the ground, and kept pushing forward.
