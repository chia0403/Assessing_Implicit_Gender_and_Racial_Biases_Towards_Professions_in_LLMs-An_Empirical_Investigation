The air hung thick with the smell of burnt coffee and regret in Eleanor Blackwood's makeshift office. It wasn't much â€“ just a cluttered corner of the sound stage at the bottom of her studio lot, dominated by a rickety desk piled high with scripts, production notes, and empty takeout containers. The flickering screen on the laptop before her displayed the latest edit of "Celestial Bloom," Eleanor's passion project turned potential career suicide.

Eleanor, whose last film had been a critical darling but a commercial flop, was desperate for a hit. "Celestial Bloom," a sci-fi epic set on a distant planet where humanity seeks refuge from an ecological apocalypse, felt like that hit. But watching the current edit, with its clunky dialogue and overly dramatic special effects, even she couldn't convince herself it was anything but a disaster waiting to happen. 

The studio execs were breathing down her neck. The release date loomed closer every day, and panic gnawed at Eleanor's gut like a rabid terrier. She rubbed her weary eyes, the faint scent of lavender oil from her hand lotion barely masking the stale odor of desperation clinging to the air. It was time for a miracle. Or at least another cup of coffee.
