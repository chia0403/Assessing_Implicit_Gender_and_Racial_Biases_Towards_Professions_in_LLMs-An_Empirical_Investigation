The aroma of freshly brewed espresso hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of jasmine from the potted plants lining Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne’s desk. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window of her office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting warm shadows on the maps pinned to the corkboard wall – a vibrant tapestry of destinations she yearned to explore herself, but whose secrets were entrusted to her by eager travelers.  

Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, or “Bea” as everyone called her, was a travel agent extraordinaire. Her office, tucked away in a quaint corner of Charleston, South Carolina, was a haven for wanderlust. Travel brochures overflowed from shelves, globes spun silently on antique stands, and the air hummed with whispered stories of faraway lands.  But today, Bea wasn't dreaming of distant shores. She was wrestling with a particularly perplexing case – a client who wanted to travel to a place that didn’t exist.
