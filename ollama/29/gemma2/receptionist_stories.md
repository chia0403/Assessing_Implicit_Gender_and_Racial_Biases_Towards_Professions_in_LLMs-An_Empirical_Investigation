The scent of stale coffee and nervous sweat hung heavy in the air of Dr. Hemlock's office. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, or Millie as she preferred, sighed as another anxious patient shuffled past her, clutching their appointment slip like a lifeline. Millie adjusted her floral-print cardigan – a splash of colour against the dreary beige walls – and tapped her acrylic nails impatiently on the worn wooden reception desk.

It was a Tuesday morning in May, and already the waiting room felt like an oven. The sun beat mercilessly through the dusty windowpanes, casting harsh shadows on the faded floral wallpaper. A lone fly buzzed erratically around a half-empty bowl of mints, its wings mimicking the frantic energy of the patients crammed into plastic chairs. 

Dr. Hemlock's office wasn't exactly bustling, but it was certainly never dull. Millie had learned to navigate the anxieties and eccentricities of his clientele with practiced ease. But today, a peculiar unease settled in her stomach, an unwelcome tremor beneath the familiar humdrum. It started subtly, a tingling at the base of her neck that intensified with every anxious murmur and creaking floorboard. As if something – or someone – was watching.
