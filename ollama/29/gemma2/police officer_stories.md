The biting wind whipped Detective Isabella "Izzy" Reyes's hair across her face as she surveyed the desolate cityscape. Rain lashed against the cracked asphalt, each drop exploding into a miniature starburst in the city's dim glow. The air reeked of damp concrete and burnt rubber, the ever-present aroma of a city that never slept, even in its sorrow. A towering skyscraper, half shrouded in mist, loomed over them, its glass facade reflecting the flickering neon signs below like fractured dreams.  

This was Neo-Manhattan, a sprawling metropolis choked by shadows and secrets, where hope often died before it could fully bloom. And tonight, another tragedy had unfolded within its steel and glass embrace. A body lay sprawled on the grimy pavement, a stark silhouette against the cityscape's melancholic backdrop. It was Izzy's job to find out who took this life, but with every case, she felt a growing sense of unease that the city itself was swallowing them whole.
