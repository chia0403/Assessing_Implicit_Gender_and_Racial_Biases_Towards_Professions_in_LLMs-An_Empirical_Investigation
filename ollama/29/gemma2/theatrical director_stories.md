The humid air hung heavy in the cramped rehearsal space, thick with the scent of sweat, hairspray, and simmering resentment. 

Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright adjusted her tortoiseshell spectacles, peering over the heads of the actors scattered across the dusty floor. Each one seemed to be radiating a distinct shade of frustration, mirroring the disarray of the forgotten props strewn about like fallen soldiers. Eleanor sighed, her breath catching in the stillness before the next inevitable outburst. 

This was it, the fourth week of rehearsals for "The Tempest," and the magic, if there ever was any, had long since evaporated. The cast, a motley crew of seasoned professionals and wide-eyed newcomers, seemed united only in their shared discontent with Eleanor’s increasingly demanding vision.  Her apartment, which doubled as her makeshift office, was littered with discarded scripts, coffee cups, and crumpled notes – each one testament to the hours she'd poured into this production, a labour of love that felt more like an albatross around her neck. 


The setting: A dilapidated community theatre in a forgotten corner of Brooklyn, New York. The year: 1998.
