The aroma of freshly ground cinnamon hung heavy in the air, battling with the metallic tang of disinfectant that seemed to permeate every corner of Dr. Amelia Grace's office. Sunlight slanted through the blinds, casting dusty squares across the worn linoleum floor.  It was early morning, just past seven, and the world outside was still waking up. Here, inside her cramped third-floor practice in downtown Chicago, Amelia was already knee-deep in spreadsheets, charting clients' progress, and strategizing meal plans.
