The biting wind clawed at Seraphina Thorne's exposed skin, whipping strands of her already-tangled dark hair across her face. The chill seeped through her worn leather armor, reminding her why she loathed night shifts on the city walls. Below, the bustling marketplace of Havenwood was a distant memory - a riot of colors and smells replaced by an unnerving quiet punctuated only by the occasional scuttling of unseen creatures in the shadows. Above, a sliver of moon cast long, skeletal fingers across the battlements, highlighting the rough-hewn stonework that bore the scars of countless sieges.

Seraphina leaned against a crumbling parapet, her hand resting on the hilt of her sword. The familiar weight offered some comfort in this desolate expanse. Her post was lonely, but it was also a privilege - she guarded Havenwood's western gate, the primary entrance to the city and its bustling trade routes. Tonight, however, her vigilance felt especially critical.  Rumors had been swirling for weeks about restless spirits gathering beyond the city walls, drawn by the potent magic that thrummed through Havenwood’s very core. 


The whispers were dismissed as superstition by most, but Seraphina knew better. She’d seen things in her years guarding these walls – strange lights flickering in the distance, fleeting glimpses of figures moving too fast to be human. Tonight, she felt a prickling unease, a sense that something was amiss, waiting just beyond the reach of the flickering lantern light.
