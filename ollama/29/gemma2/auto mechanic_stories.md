The air hung thick with the scent of engine oil and stale coffee in Benny "Grease Monkey" Garibaldi's garage.  Grease stained his overalls, a testament to countless hours spent coaxing life back into forgotten engines. The single overhead bulb cast long shadows across the tools scattered like soldiers on his workbench, each one meticulously cleaned and organized. Outside, a steady drizzle lashed against the corrugated tin roof, the rhythmic drumming almost drowning out the roar of Benny's latest project – a hulking vintage muscle car with more personality than miles. 


Benny ran a calloused hand over the engine block, feeling for any telltale vibrations. "C’mon, Betsy," he muttered to the car, his voice gruff but laced with affection. "Just a little more and she'll be purring like a kitten."  He knew Betsy was special – more than just another job on his crowded schedule. She represented the golden age of American muscle, a time when cars were built with heart and soul, not just profit margins. He wasn’t just fixing her; he was breathing life back into a legend.
