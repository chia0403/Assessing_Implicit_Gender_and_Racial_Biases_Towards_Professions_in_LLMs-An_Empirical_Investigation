The Arizona sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Rosethorn's collarbone as she navigated the dusty path towards the dilapidated house. The realtor sign in the front yard seemed to droop like a wilted sunflower, its bright yellow paint peeling under the relentless heat.  This wasn't her usual clientele - sprawling mansions with infinity pools and meticulously manicured lawns. No, this was a fixer-upper in a forgotten corner of Tucson, the kind that attracted hoarders and dreamers in equal measure. Amy leaned closer to the sign, squinting at the address scrawled across it: 2348 Calle de Luna - a name as poetic as the crumbling stucco facade was grim.  This house, with its chipped paint and overgrown cactus garden, held stories within its walls â€“ stories Amy hoped she could untangle.
