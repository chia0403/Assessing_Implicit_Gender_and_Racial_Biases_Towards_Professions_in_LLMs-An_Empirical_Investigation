The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting familiarity to Elara Blackwood as she stepped into the hushed sanctuary of Oakhaven Library. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting rainbows across the worn wooden floorboards and illuminating the countless bookshelves that lined the walls like towering sentinels. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves outside, whispering secrets through the open window overlooking the cobblestone street.

Elara ran a hand along the spine of a leather-bound volume, its title barely visible beneath layers of dust. She adjusted her spectacles and smiled â€“ even after twenty years, Oakhaven held the same magic for her. This was her haven, her kingdom built not of stone and steel but of stories, whispered knowledge, and the faint hum of countless lives lived and documented within these walls. 


But today, something felt different. A disquiet hung in the air, a subtle shift in the usual peaceful rhythm. It started as a prickle at the back of Elara's neck, an almost imperceptible tremor that ran through the very foundation of the library.
