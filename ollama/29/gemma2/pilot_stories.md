The rhythmic hum of the engine was the only thing separating Elias Thorne from the vast, indifferent canvas of the night sky. Below him, Las Vegas sprawled like a glittering mirage, its neon arteries pulsing with life.  Elias traced the familiar outlines of the Strip with his gloved fingertip against the cockpit window – the Eiffel Tower replica shimmering under the full moon, the Bellagio fountains erupting in a synchronized ballet of water and light.

But this trip felt different. The air held a strange tension, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck that whispered of something amiss. 


Elias tightened his grip on the yoke, feeling the familiar thrill of control amidst the vastness above. He squinted through the cockpit window, searching for any sign of the anomaly that tugged at his senses. As he scanned the horizon, a faint glimmer caught his eye – a single point of light, pulsating like a dying star, far beyond the city lights.
