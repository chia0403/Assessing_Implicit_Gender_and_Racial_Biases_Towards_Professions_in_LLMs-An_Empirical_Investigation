The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice Amelia "Bea" Cartwright's head like a swarm of anxious bees. Dust motes danced in their sterile glow, reflecting off the meticulously organized stacks of paperwork that filled her tiny office. Outside, Chicago winter raged – icy wind howling through the gaps in her storefront windows, snow piling high against the door. But inside, Bea’s world was warm, predictable, and decidedly paper-heavy. This was tax season, and Bea's small business, "Cartwright's Calculations," was buzzing with activity. 

Each year, she welcomed a motley crew of clients – nervous college students filing their first returns, seasoned entrepreneurs wrestling with complicated deductions, and everyone in between, each carrying the weight of their financial year on their shoulders. Today, the waiting area held a man clutching a worn briefcase, his face etched with worry lines that spoke volumes about his current tax situation, and a young woman giggling nervously as she sifted through receipts labelled "Birthday Party" and "Coffee Breaks". Bea took a sip of her lukewarm coffee, the caffeine doing little to quell the familiar pre-season jitters. This year felt different. The air crackled with an unspoken tension, as if the very fabric of their predictable world was about to unravel.
