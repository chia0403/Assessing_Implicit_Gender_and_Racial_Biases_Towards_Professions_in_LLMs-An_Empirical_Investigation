The quarry air hung thick with dust and the scent of lichen-covered granite. Dew glistened on the rough edges of the newly excavated stones, catching the faint light filtering through the canopy of ancient oaks that lined the edge of the pit. This was Elara Thorne's world - a symphony of hammer blows ringing against cool stone, the rhythmic grind of chisel on surface, and the quiet satisfaction of shaping raw nature into something beautiful. 

Elara, her name echoing with the sharp clink of her tools,  squinted through the rising mist at the sunrise painting the sky in hues of lavender and gold. Her weathered hands, calloused from years of toil, rested on a block of granite so pale it seemed to glow. Today's commission was for a nobleman in the city - a monument to commemorate his recently deceased wife. Elara had already begun sketching out the design: a graceful figure draped in flowing robes, her face etched with an expression of serene peace. It would be a masterpiece, worthy of the woman she was meant to honour. 

But as Elara hefted her tools, a tremor ran through the quarry floor, followed by a low rumble that echoed through the trees. The mist swirled and deepened, obscuring the sunrise. A shiver ran down her spine. Something wasn't right. This wasn't just the usual settling of the earth; this feltâ€¦ different.
