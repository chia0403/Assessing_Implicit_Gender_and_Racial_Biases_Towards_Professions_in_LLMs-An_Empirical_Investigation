The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and regret in the opulent lobby of the Grand Étoile Hotel.  Elodie Claire Dubois surveyed the scene from her perch behind the polished mahogany desk – a symphony of wealth and boredom unfolding before her. A gaggle of socialites, faces sculpted by Botox and shadowed by designer sunglasses, gossiped about the latest charity gala while clutching champagne flutes filled with barely touched bubbly. A businessman in a tailored suit paced back and forth, his phone pressed to his ear, barking orders in clipped tones that bounced off the gilded walls. 

Elodie, her crisp white uniform a beacon of order amidst the chaos, sighed inwardly. Another Tuesday night at the Grand Étoile. She knew every guest by name, their habits, their neuroses – some more fascinating than others. Tonight, however, promised to be particularly…interesting.  A new arrival had just checked in: someone named Silas Blackwood, his face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat and shrouded in an air of unsettling secrecy. Elodie felt a prickle of curiosity, the kind that sent shivers down her spine and reminded her why she loved her job – the Grand Étoile was never dull.
