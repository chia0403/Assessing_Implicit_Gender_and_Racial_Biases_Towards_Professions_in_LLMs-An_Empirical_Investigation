The rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Harper’s office window, mimicking the frantic beat of her own heart. She peered through the glass at the deluge outside, watching as the grey city swallowed itself in a curtain of water. The muted streetlights cast an eerie orange glow on the slick asphalt, and the rhythmic whoosh of the wind seemed to carry whispered secrets into the night.

Amelia’s office was nestled above a bustling bakery on a quaint side street in Brooklyn Heights. It was a space that usually felt cozy and welcoming, bathed in warm sunlight streaming through the oversized bay windows. But tonight, the gloom of the storm seeped through every crack, casting a shadow over her meticulously arranged bookshelves and the comforting aroma of lavender essential oil diffuser.  

Her phone buzzed on the desk, jolting her from her thoughts. It was a late-night call from Michael, her newest patient – a young musician wrestling with crippling stage fright. Amelia sighed. Tonight was supposed to be a quiet evening, a chance to catch up on paperwork and lose herself in a good book. But with the storm raging outside and Michael’s anxieties echoing through her mind, she knew it was going to be anything but.
