The bell's shrill cry sliced through the cacophony of hallway chatter, echoing across the sterile linoleum floor of Hawthorne High School. 

Eleanor Amelia Finch, her cardigan slightly askew and a faint scent of lavender clinging to her, surveyed the scene with practiced detachment.  As the school psychologist, Eleanor was accustomed to the tidal wave of adolescent emotions that surged through these corridors daily.  But today felt different. A tremor of unease, like static electricity, crackled in the air.

Hawthorne High had always been a crucible of teenage angst, but something had shifted. Whispers about strange occurrences – flickering lights, disembodied voices, objects vanishing and reappearing – circulated among the students like wildfire. Even the usually unfazed teachers seemed on edge. 

Eleanor, ever the pragmatist, chalked it up to collective anxiety before the upcoming state exams. But as she watched a group of freshman huddled together, their faces pale and wide-eyed, she couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling that something deeper, more inexplicable, was at play.


The setting is Hawthorne High School, a large public high school in a suburban town grappling with its own anxieties about progress and change. The school building itself is a mixture of aged brick and outdated architecture, hinting at a past where things felt simpler.
