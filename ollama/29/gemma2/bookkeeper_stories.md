The flickering gas lamp cast long, dancing shadows across Agatha Bellweather's meticulously organized ledger. The scent of aged paper and ink hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in her cramped backroom office above Mr. Higgins' haberdashery. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, a melancholic counterpoint to the rhythmic scratch of Agatha’s quill as she meticulously tallied debts and credits for Mrs. Featherstone’s bustling tea shop.  

A gust of wind rattled the shutters, sending a shiver down Agatha's spine. She pulled her woolen cardigan tighter around her thin frame, wishing for a roaring fire instead of the lone candle flickering on her desk. 

Agatha Bellweather was not a woman prone to daydreams. Her world was one of precise figures, neat columns, and the satisfying weight of a balanced account. But tonight, as the storm raged outside and the city slumbered beneath a blanket of rain, even Agatha couldn't entirely dismiss the strange feeling that something was amiss.
