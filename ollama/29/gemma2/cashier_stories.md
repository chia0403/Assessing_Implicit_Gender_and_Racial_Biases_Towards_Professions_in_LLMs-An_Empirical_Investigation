The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Beatrice Carter's head, their pale glow illuminating the chipped linoleum floor and dusty shelves of "Bargain Buys." A lone fly buzzed against the grimy window, its frantic path mimicking the restless energy that pulsed beneath Amelia's skin. It was another Tuesday afternoon in this retail purgatory, and the hours stretched before her like a desolate highway with no exit sign in sight.  

Amelia swiped her nametag across the scanner, registering for yet another shift in the monotony of scanning barcodes and counting coins. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the cracked asphalt parking lot, baking the world into a shimmering mirage. Inside, the air hung thick and stale, punctuated only by the occasional clatter of discarded merchandise or the muffled murmur of customers haggling over outdated knick-knacks. 


Amelia sighed, her gaze falling upon the clock that blinked a cruel reminder of the time: 2:17 p.m. Three more hours until freedom. She hoped something interesting would happen before then.
