The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the low hum of traffic outside. Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa, each drop a tiny drumbeat on the glass.  Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne kneaded her thumbs into the tight muscles of Mrs. Peterson's shoulders, her movements practiced and soothing. The rhythmic pressure eased away years of tension, transforming the tense woman into someone almost serene. 

Amelia loved this part - melting away the knots of stress, watching faces relax with each gentle stroke. She thrived in the quiet hum of the spa, a world away from the bustling city outside. But tonight, something felt different. The rain, usually a lullaby, seemed to whisper secrets against the glass. And when Mrs. Peterson sighed, it wasn't just the sigh of relief, but a murmur laced with something else â€“ fear. 


Amelia paused, her intuition tingling. This was more than muscle tension; there was a story unfolding beneath Mrs. Peterson's skin, a story she hadn't quite finished telling.
