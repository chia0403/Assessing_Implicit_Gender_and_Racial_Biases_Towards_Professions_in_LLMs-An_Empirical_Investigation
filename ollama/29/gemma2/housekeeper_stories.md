The scent of beeswax polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender from Mrs. Van Derlyn's prized collection of soaps. Eleanor Thistlewick sighed, running her hand over the polished surface of the antique writing desk. It was a Thursday morning, and the sprawling manor house of Oakhaven slept beneath a blanket of mist, its grand facade obscured by the early-morning gloom.

She'd been housekeeper at Oakhaven for fifteen years, a lifetime it seemed, devoted to keeping the Van Derlyn family's meticulously ordered life running smoothly. But lately, even the comforting rhythm of her days felt out of tune. A restlessness had begun to gnaw at her, a yearning for something more than the endless cycle of dusting, polishing, and preparing for meals that were never eaten in shared laughter but always in solemn silence.

It wasn't one of Mrs. Van Derlyn's beloved cookbooks or novels; these were something different entirely â€“ fantastical creatures and landscapes sketched in vibrant colours that seemed to hum with life. Eleanor picked it up gingerly, a shiver running down her spine as she realized this was no ordinary sketchbook.  Something extraordinary had entered the quiet world of Oakhaven, and Eleanor felt a pull towards it, like an ember igniting within her long-dormant spirit.
