Rain lashed against the frosted glass windows of Mr. Cavendish's office, mimicking the frantic tapping of Amelia Juniper's fingers on her antique typewriter. The year was 1947, and London still wore the melancholy air of wartime rationing, though victory had been declared months ago. Outside, the world bustled with newfound hope, but within the mahogany-paneled confines of Mr. Cavendish's office, a storm brewed.  

Amelia squinted at the typed page, her brow furrowed in concentration. The words swam before her eyes, blurring into an unintelligible mess. It wasn't writer's block – she had penned countless reports and memos for Mr. Cavendish, his eccentric inventor of dubious gadgets and even more dubious business ventures. No, this was different. This was a letter to the esteemed Royal Society, proposing a revolutionary invention: a self-winding umbrella that would forever banish soggy sidewalks. 

Amelia glanced at the clock on the mantelpiece – five minutes to Mr. Cavendish's return from his "field research." He called it that, anyway. She suspected a trip to the pub was more likely. But she had promised him this letter, and Amelia Juniper kept her promises.  


Besides, something about Mr. Cavendish's latest invention whispered possibilities. A self-winding umbrella... it sounded absurd, yet undeniably intriguing.
