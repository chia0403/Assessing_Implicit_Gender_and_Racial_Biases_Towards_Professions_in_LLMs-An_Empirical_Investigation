The scent of sawdust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of fresh-cut cedar. Sunlight streamed through the gaps in the barn's weathered wood siding, illuminating motes that danced in the stillness. Thomas "Tommy" Blackwood wiped sweat from his brow, his calloused fingers tracing the smooth curve of a half-carved dovetail joint. Outside, the wind whispered through the tall pines bordering his grandfather's property in rural Vermont, carrying with it the promise of an autumn storm brewing on the horizon.

Inside, Tommy was consumed by his work. For years, he had labored alongside his grandfather, learning the secrets of the trade - the feel of a chisel against wood, the precise angle of a saw, the patient rhythm of sanding.  Now, after his grandfather's passing, the responsibility of the workshop and its legacy fell squarely on Tommy's shoulders. 

He ran a hand over the unfinished chest he was building, its intricate design reflecting the beauty and resilience of the Vermont landscape he called home. This wasn't just another commission; it was a testament to his grandfather's memory, a piece infused with years of shared love for their craft.  But as the wind howled outside, whispering of approaching darkness, Tommy couldn't shake the feeling that this project held something more than just wood and nails. A sense of urgency, almost premonition, gnawed at him, urging him to finish before nightfall.
