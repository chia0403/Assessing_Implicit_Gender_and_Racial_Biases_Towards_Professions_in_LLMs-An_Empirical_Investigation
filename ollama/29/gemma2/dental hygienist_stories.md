The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the stainless steel instruments laid out on Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne's tray. Outside, the summer sun beat down on Maple Street Dental, turning the waiting room into a sauna even with the air conditioner struggling valiantly against the heat. Bea sighed, adjusting her blue scrubs and wishing for a cool breeze and a cup of iced tea.

This was her fourth patient in an hour, and the morning had already been a marathon of plaque removal and sugary-sweet breath mints. Her last patient, Mr. Henderson, had insisted on discussing his fantasy football team during his cleaning, making it harder than usual to concentrate. Now, she sat poised with her tools, ready for her next victim â€“ or, as she liked to think of them, "dental enthusiasts."

Bea preferred mornings to afternoons. The air felt crisper, the patients less anxious, and there was a certain satisfaction in watching those pearly whites gleam after a thorough cleaning.  But today, even the promise of gleaming teeth couldn't quite erase the sense of restlessness that had been clinging to her all week. 


Something felt different. Something was about to change.
