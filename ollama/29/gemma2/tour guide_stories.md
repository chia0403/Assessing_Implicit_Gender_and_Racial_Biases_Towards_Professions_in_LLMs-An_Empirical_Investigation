The afternoon sun beat down on Amelia Thistlewood's back as she herded her group of tourists towards the entrance of Pompeii. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by shafts of light piercing through the cypress trees that lined the path. 

Amelia adjusted her straw hat and smiled brightly, though a bead of sweat trickled down her temple.  "Welcome to Pompeii!" she boomed, her voice competing with the cicadas buzzing in the heat. "Today, we'll journey back in time to 79 AD, when this bustling city was frozen forever by Mount Vesuvius' wrath."

Her group, a motley crew of sunburnt tourists from around the globe, shifted their weight impatiently. Amelia, however, wasn't fazed. She loved sharing her knowledge of Pompeii with visitors, bringing its ancient stories to life amidst the eerie silence of the preserved ruins. 


The air hung heavy with the ghosts of history - whispers carried on the wind through crumbling walls and sun-bleached mosaics.  Amelia felt a familiar thrill course through her. This wasn't just a job; it was a pilgrimage, a chance to connect with the past and keep its memory alive.
