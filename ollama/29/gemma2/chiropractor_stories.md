The aroma of peppermint oil and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of cinnamon from the diffuser nestled in the corner. Sunlight streamed through the windows of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Brighton's clinic, painting stripes across the worn wooden floorboards. Outside, the bustling streets of Asheville, North Carolina, thrummed with life, a vibrant tapestry of honking horns and chatter that faded into a muffled hum within the sanctuary of Ellie's practice. But today, even the usual comforting rhythm felt off-key. A prickle of unease ran down Ellie's spine as she glanced at the clock: 9:57 AM. Her most challenging patient of the day, Mr. Henderson, was due in exactly three minutes, and his appointment had always been a delicate dance. He was a man shrouded in mystery, his past riddled with whispers of pain that went beyond the physical. 


Ellie straightened her posture, adjusting the collar of her crisp white tunic. She inhaled deeply, letting the calming scent of lavender oil she'd applied to her wrists ground her. It was time to face Mr. Henderson and his burdens once again.
