The neon sign outside flickered "Open" with a tired buzz, casting an anemic green glow on Eleanor Rose Blackwood's face. She sighed, tucking a stray auburn curl behind her ear as she surveyed the desolate landscape of The Rusty Spigot, her usual haunt.

It was Tuesday night – prime rib night – and yet only three tables were occupied: a couple arguing over who ate the last onion ring, a lone businessman hunched over his laptop, and a group of college kids giggling too loudly in the corner booth. Eleanor longed for the Friday night rush, the chaotic symphony of clattering dishes and booming laughter that made The Spigot feel alive. Tonight, however, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer and unfulfilled expectations.

Eleanor adjusted her apron – "The Rusty Spigot: Where Good Times Flow" emblazoned across it in faded yellow lettering – and pasted on a smile as she approached Table 3.  "Can I get you anything else?" she asked, already knowing the answer would be no.
