The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of salt and jasmine. Cicadas buzzed their relentless song from the magnolia trees lining Church Street, while tourists gawked at the pastel-colored houses, snapping photos with an almost frantic urgency. Inside Bartholomew "Bart" Montgomery's barbershop, however, the world outside melted away. The rhythmic snip of his shears against hair was a comforting counterpoint to the clinking of glasses from the nearby tavern. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpane, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its golden ray. Bart, a man whose silver beard rivaled the length of his years, surveyed his handiwork in the mirror â€“ a freshly shaved head gleaming under the light. He smiled, pleased with his work. This was his sanctuary, a space carved out from the chaos, where he could transform men into their best selves, one haircut at a time.
