The air hung thick with chlorine and the faint scent of cheap hot dogs.  Sweat slicked Elara Finch's palms as she adjusted her smile, forcing it to stay bright even though the humidity was threatening to melt her mascara. It wasn't ideal conditions for selling vacation timeshares, but then again, nothing about this job had been ideal so far.  

She stood beside a plastic pool shaped like a dolphin, hawking "unforgettable family memories" to anyone who wandered within earshot of her perfectly rehearsed pitch. Around her, the manufactured tropical paradise of Paradise Palms Resort shimmered under the unforgiving Florida sun. Tourists, their faces plastered with sunscreen and boredom, shuffled past, dodging overly-enthusiastic salespeople like Elara herself. She sighed inwardly, knowing that each "no thank you" chipped away at her already dwindling hope.  Today was crucial. If she didn't make at least two sales, she wouldn't have enough to cover rent next month.
