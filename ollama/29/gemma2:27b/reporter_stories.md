The humid New Orleans air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and decay, a peculiar but potent combination that Amelia "Amy" Benoit had come to associate with her hometown.  Sunlight glinted off the greasy cobblestones of Decatur Street, illuminating the vibrant chaos of street musicians, tourists gawking at voodoo shops, and vendors hawking beignets still warm from the fryer.

Today's story wouldn't involve voodoo queens or jazz legends; it was something far grittier: a string of seemingly unconnected disappearances plaguing the French Quarter, whispers of which had been swirling through the city like a persistent fog.  Amy, driven by her insatiable curiosity and a healthy dose of journalistic ambition, was determined to uncover the truth, no matter how deep she had to dig.
