Neon signs from the ramen shop across the street flickered through the deluge, casting an oily, shifting rainbow on his cluttered desk. Empty coffee cups huddled amongst tangled wires and half-eaten takeout containers, testament to Elias's all-nighter wrestling with a particularly obstinate line of code. 

His fingers flew over the keyboard, a blur of motion punctuated by frustrated sighs. The screen glowed a sickly green, illuminating the dark circles under his eyes. Elias, a wiry man with perpetually tousled brown hair and a beard that seemed to defy gravity, rubbed his temples, trying to quell the burgeoning headache.

Elias had been lured in with promises of groundbreaking research and unlimited resources, but now, alone in his rain-soaked apartment, he wondered if he'd stumbled into something far more dangerous.
