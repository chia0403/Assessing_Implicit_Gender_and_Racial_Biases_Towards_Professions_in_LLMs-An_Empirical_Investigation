The air hung thick with anticipation and cigarette smoke in The Dusty Microphone, a dimly lit dive bar on the fringes of New Orleans' French Quarter.  Neon signs flickered outside, casting an erratic glow onto the worn wooden floorboards.  Eliza Jane "EJ" Dubois nervously adjusted the strap of her battered acoustic guitar, its chipped paint mirroring the imperfections etched on her own face. The weight of a thousand unsung songs pressed down on her shoulders, heavy with dreams and disappointments. Tonight was different. Tonight, EJ knew, she had to pour her soul into every note. Tonight, a legendary bluesman, rumored to scout talent in the city's shadowy corners, was said to be in the audience.


EJ closed her eyes, drawing strength from the scent of stale beer and forgotten dreams that permeated the air. This could be her ticket out, her chance to finally share her music with the world beyond these smoke-filled walls. The emcee announced her name, his voice barely audible above the murmur of conversation.

EJ took a deep breath, strummed a chord, and began to sing.
