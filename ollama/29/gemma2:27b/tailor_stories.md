Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the already dim streetlights of Lower East Side Manhattan into hazy halos. Inside his cramped shop, Elias Mordecai meticulously measured a length of crimson velvet, his brow furrowed in concentration. The air hung thick with the scent of mothballs and aging wool, punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of his needle against fabric. Elias, a man whose face bore the map of countless sleepless nights and whose hands moved with the precision of a surgeon, was renowned throughout the tenement district for crafting garments that fit like a second skin.

Tonight, however, Elias's usual calm was shattered by a gnawing anxiety. His latest client, a woman shrouded in secrecy who insisted on anonymity, had commissioned a gown unlike any he'd ever seen - a swirling confection of midnight blue silk embroidered with shimmering silver thread, said to hold the power to "bend fate itself."
