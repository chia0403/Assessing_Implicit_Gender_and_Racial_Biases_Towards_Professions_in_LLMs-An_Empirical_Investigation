Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Elodie Cartwright's studio apartment, mimicking the turmoil brewing within her chest. Outside, the neon signs of the Bowery flickered in and out like nervous fireflies, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the bare brick walls of her space. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wool and stale coffee, a familiar blend for Elodie, who often worked late into the night, fueled by caffeine and a burning desire to make things beautiful.

Tonight, however, beauty seemed a distant mirage. Elodie stared at the crumpled rejection letter on her desk, its crisp white surface mocking her aspirations. The prestigious design firm, Beaumont & Thorne, had deemed her portfolio "lacking in vision." Her stomach churned with frustration and self-doubt. She'd poured her heart and soul into those designs, meticulously crafting each detail, striving to create spaces that felt both functional and soulful.


Was she truly lacking in vision? Or was it something else – a lack of connections, perhaps, or the misfortune of being born on the wrong side of Manhattan? Elodie lived in a world where privilege reigned supreme, where access to opportunity often hinged on who you knew rather than what you could do.

Despite the sting of rejection, a flicker of defiance ignited within her. She wouldn't let one setback define her. Elodie Cartwright was determined to carve out her own path, even if it meant starting from scratch.

The rain intensified, drumming a relentless rhythm against the window. But inside Elodie’s studio, a different beat began to stir – a steady pulse of creativity, fueled by resilience and the unwavering belief in her own talent.
