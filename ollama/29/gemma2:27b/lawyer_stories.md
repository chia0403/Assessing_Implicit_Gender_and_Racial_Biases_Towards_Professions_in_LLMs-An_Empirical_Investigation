Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Elias Blackwood's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head. He stared out at the neon-drenched cityscape, a labyrinth of towering skyscrapers and winding alleyways swallowed by a perpetual twilight. The air hung heavy with the smell of exhaust fumes and cheap ramen noodles wafting from the greasy spoon across the street.

Elias Blackwood wasn't your typical lawyer. Forget crisp suits and mahogany desks - his office was a cramped affair tucked away in a forgotten corner of Chinatown, its walls adorned with faded legal textbooks and peeling posters of long-forgotten revolutionaries. He specialized in cases others wouldn't touch: the downtrodden, the voiceless, those who had nowhere else to turn. Today's case, however, threatened to push him beyond his limits.

A knock on the door, sharp and insistent, broke through Elias' reverie. He rose from his creaky chair, a weary sigh escaping his lips, and made his way towards the entrance. He knew who it was before he even opened the door. It was time for the fight to begin.
