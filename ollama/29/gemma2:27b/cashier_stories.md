The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Grace Cavendish, casting a sickly yellow glow over the endless stream of grocery items passing across her conveyor belt. The air hung thick with the scent of stale bread and disinfectant, punctuated by occasional whiffs of something vaguely citrusy, emanating from the automatic air freshener perched precariously on a shelf above her head. Eleanor sighed, her breath fogging the plastic shield separating her from the impatient customers.

It was Wednesday afternoon, peak hour at the Save-Mart supermarket in the sleepy suburb of Oakhaven.  Eleanor's fingers flew across the scanner, beep-beep-beeping their way through cartons of milk, bags of potatoes, and boxes of cereal. The monotony was broken only by the occasional disgruntled grunt from a customer waiting in line, or the piercing shriek of a toddler demanding candy. Eleanor longed for something more, anything more than this endless cycle of scanning and bagging. She dreamed of adventures, of escaping the confines of Oakhaven and discovering something new, something exciting. But for now, she was stuck here, behind her register, a cog in the machine of everyday life.
