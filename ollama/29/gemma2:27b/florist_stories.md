Rain lashed against the windowpanes of 'Blooms & Bliss', the rhythmic drumming mimicking Elara Rosalind Hawthorne's own frantic heartbeat. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh were slick with water, reflecting the flickering gaslights in an ethereal dance. Inside, however, the air was warm and fragrant, a symphony of scents from lilies, roses, and hyacinths mingling together. 

Elara paused, her hand hovering over a bouquet of crimson carnations. She'd been expecting this delivery for weeks - a rare variety flown in from Holland, destined to grace the centerpiece at Lady Cavendish's grand ball. But now, with the storm raging outside and the clock ticking down to the event, doubt gnawed at Elara. Would she be able to deliver them on time? Or would this prized order become another casualty of the tempestuous Scottish weather?
