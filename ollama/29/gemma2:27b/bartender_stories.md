Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mug, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a feverish pink smear. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and regret. Bartholomew "Bart" Callahan, a man whose face bore the map of countless late nights and broken dreams, idly polished a glass, his eyes fixed on the swirling storm outside. The usual Friday night crowd was sparse, a lone woman nursing a gin and tonic in the corner booth, a couple arguing quietly over lukewarm coffees at the counter. Bart knew their stories â€“ they were all etched into the worn wood of the bar, whispered in the clink of ice against glass. 

Tonight, however, a different story promised to unfold. A figure stood silhouetted against the rain-streaked window, his trench coat dripping onto the welcome mat. He hesitated for a moment, then pushed open the door, bringing with him a gust of cold wind and the scent of something sharp and unfamiliar - ozone, perhaps, or danger.
