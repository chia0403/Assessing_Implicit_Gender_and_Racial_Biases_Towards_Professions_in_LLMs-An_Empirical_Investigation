The air in Miss Eliza Penhale's office was thick with the scent of stale ink and lavender polish. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windowpane, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the yellow beam. Outside, the cobbled streets of London buzzed with the clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the cries of street vendors. But inside Eliza's cramped sanctuary at the back of Mr. Blackwood's haberdashery, a different world existed â€“ one ruled by ledgers, invoices, and the satisfying click of an abacus. 

Eliza, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, hunched over a stack of receipts. Her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously transcribed figures into her ledger, each entry precise and perfectly aligned. She was a woman of routine and order, her life governed by the meticulous rhythm of debits and credits. But today, a misplaced decimal point threatened to disrupt her carefully constructed world.

A sudden clatter from downstairs broke Eliza's focus. Footsteps pounded up the stairs, heavy and hurried.
