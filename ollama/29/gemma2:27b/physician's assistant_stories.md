Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of mud. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of wet earth and woodsmoke, punctuated by the sharp tang of antiseptic from within. Elara Santiago, her dark braid plastered to her cheek, sighed as she surveyed the overflowing waiting room. It was always like this during monsoon season â€“ coughs echoing through the cramped space, feverish eyes pleading for relief, and a chorus of worried murmurs in Kinyarwanda. 

Elara adjusted her mask, the familiar weight a comfort against the chaos. Despite the relentless downpour, patients streamed in from the nearby villages, their faces etched with the hardships they endured. Today was no different. A young mother clutching a wheezing child, an elderly man doubled over with pain, and a farmer whose calloused hand trembled as he explained his sudden blindness.

Elara's heart ached for them all. In this remote corner of Rwanda, she was more than just a physician's assistant. She was a lifeline, a beacon of hope against the relentless tide of illness and poverty. Today, she would be their shield, wielding her stethoscope and knowledge as weapons against the unseen enemy.
