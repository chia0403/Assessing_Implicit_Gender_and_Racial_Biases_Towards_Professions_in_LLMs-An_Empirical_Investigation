Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's cozy chiropractic office, blurring the view of the quaint Victorian houses lining Elm Street. The rhythmic drumming was almost soothing, masking the anxious thumping in Eleanor's chest. Today wasn’t just any Tuesday; it was her first day running her own practice after years spent honing her skills under the tutelage of Dr. Hawthorne, a gruff but kind mentor who had recently retired.

Eleanor glanced around the room she'd poured her heart and soul into decorating – warm earth tones accented by pops of calming blue, motivational quotes scrawled on chalkboard walls, and the gentle scent of lavender oil wafting from the diffuser. It felt welcoming, nurturing, a space where healing could begin.  But would it be enough? 


Would patients trust a young woman barely out of her residency to realign their spines and ease their pain? The doubt gnawed at her, threatening to unravel the carefully constructed confidence she'd built over years of study.

Just then, the bell above the door chimed, announcing her first patient. Eleanor straightened her posture, took a deep breath, and plastered on a welcoming smile. This was it. Time to prove herself.
