Rain lashed against the windows of SereneTouch Massage Therapy, blurring the streetlights into hazy halos. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender and sandalwood, a desperate attempt to mask the underlying tension that hung heavy in the room. Eloise Marie Benoit, her dark curls escaping their braid, stared at the flickering candle on the reception desk, its flame dancing nervously like a trapped moth. 

Normally, this hour would be bustling with clients seeking solace from the day's stresses. But tonight, only one appointment remained: Mr. Henderson, a gruff retiree notorious for his demanding nature and chronic back pain. Eloise shifted her weight uneasily, her fingers tracing the worn leather of her massage table. Something felt off. Perhaps it was the relentless storm outside mirroring the turmoil brewing within her.
