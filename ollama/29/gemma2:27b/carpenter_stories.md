The salt-laced wind whipped Elias Blackwood's greying hair across his forehead as he wrestled with the stubborn oak beam. The rhythmic crash of waves against the rocky shore below punctuated the symphony of clanging tools and groaning wood echoing from his workshop. Perched precariously on the cliffside, overlooking the turbulent grey expanse of the North Sea, Elias' workshop was a testament to both his skill and his unwavering tenacity. 

Sunlight, fractured by the rain-streaked windows, painted dusty stripes across the worn floorboards, illuminating the intricate carvings adorning half-finished furniture pieces scattered throughout. The scent of sawdust and sea salt hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias.  Today, however, a knot of tension tightened in his gut. 

A stranger was expected.
