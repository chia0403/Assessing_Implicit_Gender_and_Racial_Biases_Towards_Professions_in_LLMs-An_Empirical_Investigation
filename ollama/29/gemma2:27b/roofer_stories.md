The midday sun beat down on Jackson "Jax" McKinley's neck as he hammered a shingle into place. Sweat stung his eyes, but Jax barely blinked. Years of working under the unforgiving Texas sun had toughened him up, both physically and mentally. From his vantage point atop the two-story Victorian home, he could see for miles: sprawling subdivisions giving way to rolling hills dotted with ancient oaks.  

This particular house, however, was a bit of an anomaly in their small town of Willow Creek. It was grander than most, with ornate gingerbread trim and stained-glass windows catching the sunlight like scattered jewels. There was something about it that made Jax feel uneasy, a sense of hidden history lurking beneath its peeling paint and overgrown ivy. He couldn't shake the feeling he was being watched.
