The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the watchtower like a thousand tiny fists. Each blow sent a shiver down Eldrin Thorne's spine, despite the layers of wool he wore beneath his leather jerkin. He hunched further over his brazier, its flames struggling to combat the relentless chill seeping through the gaps in the tower walls.  Below him, shrouded in mist and flickering torchlight, sprawled the sprawling ruins of Eldoria. Once a beacon of civilization, now it lay silent, save for the mournful howl of the wind whistling through broken arches and crumbling towers. 

Eldrin's gaze drifted to the distant horizon, where the jagged peaks of the Dragonfang Mountains pierced the stormy sky. Somewhere beyond those forbidding slopes, legend whispered, lay the mythical city of Azuria, a haven untouched by the cataclysm that had decimated Eldoria. He longed for its rumored safety, for warmth and companionship â€“ anything but this desolate vigil.

A sudden screech ripped through the storm's symphony. Eldrin jolted upright, hand instinctively reaching for the hilt of his sword. It wasn't the mournful cry of a carrion bird, no...this was something different, sharper, filled with an unnerving intelligence.  His heart hammered in his chest as he strained to see through the driving rain, searching for the source of the sound.

This was not a night for complacency. Not anymore.
