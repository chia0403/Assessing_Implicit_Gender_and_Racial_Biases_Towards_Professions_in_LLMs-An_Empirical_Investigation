Rain hammered against the warped windowpane of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights buzzed incessantly, adding to the tension that coiled in her gut.  Eleanor pushed aside the stack of overdue reports on her desk, their neat stacks a stark contrast to the chaos swirling within her. Today was supposed to be different. Today, she was finally meeting with Liam, a withdrawn ten-year-old who had been exhibiting troubling behaviour for months.

Liam's case file lay open before her, each entry a grim reminder of his struggles: social isolation, nightmares, sudden outbursts of anger. Eleanor had spent weeks poring over the details, trying to piece together the puzzle of Liam's fractured world. But there was something else gnawing at her – an unsettling feeling that Liam's case was more than just childhood angst.

The bell above the door jingled, announcing Liam's arrival. He stood hesitantly in the doorway, a small figure dwarfed by the weight of his silence. His dark eyes, wide with apprehension, met Eleanor's, and for a fleeting moment, she felt a pang of empathy so strong it threatened to crack her stoic facade.  

The worn carpet beneath Liam’s sneakers seemed to swallow the sound of his footsteps as he slowly made his way towards the chair opposite Eleanor's desk. The scent of rain mingled with the faint smell of lavender hand sanitizer, creating an unsettling aroma that clung to the air like a premonition.

Eleanor knew this was just the beginning.  The road ahead promised to be long and arduous, filled with hidden truths and unexpected challenges. But as she looked into Liam's haunted eyes, she steeled herself, ready to face whatever lay beneath the surface.
