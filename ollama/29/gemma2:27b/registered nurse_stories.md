Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Emergency Room, blurring the neon cityscape beyond into a watercolour smear.  The incessant beep of monitors mingled with the groans of patients and the clipped staccato of doctors barking orders. It was a symphony of chaos Eleanor Rose Montgomery knew all too well.

Her name tag, pinned precariously to her rumpled scrubs, read "Ellie," but nobody called her that here. Not in this crucible where empathy could be mistaken for weakness and every second counted towards life or death. Here, she was simply Rose, the veteran ER nurse who could anticipate a patient's needs before they even voiced them, whose hands moved with the practiced grace of a surgeon, whose calm presence was a lifeline in the storm.


Tonight, however, even Rose felt the unease creeping up her spine. The air thrummed with an unsettling energy, whispers of something unusual circulating amongst the weary staff. A string of bizarre cases, accidents seemingly defying logic, had flooded the ER over the last few hours. And now, a new ambulance siren sliced through the night, its wail carrying an urgency that chilled Rose to the bone.
