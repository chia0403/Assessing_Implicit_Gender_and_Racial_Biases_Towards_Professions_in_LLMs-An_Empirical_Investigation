The rooster's crow pierced through Elara Hawthorne’s dreams like a rusty nail. Groaning, she rolled over in her straw bed, tucking the woolen blanket tighter around her shoulders. Dawn was breaking over the rolling hills of Willow Creek Valley, painting the sky in streaks of peach and lavender. From the kitchen downstairs, the scent of woodsmoke and frying bacon drifted up, a siren song for her rumbling stomach.

Elara wasn’t one to shirk her duties. She hauled herself out of bed, her joints protesting with a series of pops and cracks that echoed through the silent farmhouse. Her calloused hands reached for the worn cotton tunic hanging on the peg by the door, pulling it over her head as she surveyed the day ahead. Today was market day in Oakhaven, a bustling town nestled at the valley's edge. Elara’s carefully tended fields of plump pumpkins and ruby-red tomatoes awaited their journey to the marketplace, promising a much-needed injection of coin into her dwindling coffers.

But today felt different. A restless energy pulsed beneath her skin, a whisper of something unknown urging her towards the horizon. As she descended the creaking wooden stairs, the scent of bacon intensified, reminding her that breakfast and the day's tasks awaited. Yet, Elara couldn’t shake the feeling that something momentous was about to unfold in Willow Creek Valley, something far beyond the usual cycle of planting and harvest.
