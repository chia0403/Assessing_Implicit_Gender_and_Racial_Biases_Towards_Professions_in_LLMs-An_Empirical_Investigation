Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of "Griffin's Remedies," the rhythmic drumming a stark contrast to the quiet ticking of the antique clock on the wall. Emilia Griffin sighed, her breath fogging the already smeared glass. She surveyed the empty shop with a pang of melancholy. It wasn't always this way. Once, Griffin's Remedies had been bustling with locals seeking Emilia's advice and expertly compounded medications. Now, chain pharmacies with their sterile aisles and robotic dispensing machines had sucked the life out of small-town apothecaries like hers. 

Emilia straightened her crisp white coat, the embroidered name tag catching the dim light filtering through the rain-streaked window. A faded photograph on the counter showed a younger Emilia, beaming beside her grandfather, Samuel Griffin, the original owner of the shop. He'd taught her everything she knew about herbs, tinctures, and the healing power of human touch â€“ something those impersonal chains could never replicate. 


Emilia hoped against hope that today would be different. Maybe someone needed a special salve for their grandmother's aching joints, or perhaps a rare herb for a brewing tea blend. But as the clock ticked past noon, she began to fear another empty day.
