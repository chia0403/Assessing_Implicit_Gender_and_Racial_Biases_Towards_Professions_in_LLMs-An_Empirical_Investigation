The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Silas Thaddeus Hawthorne, a man weathered by years spent coaxing life from the stubborn soil, surveyed his domain with a critical eye. Oakhaven Cemetery stretched before him, a tapestry of moss-covered headstones, weeping willows, and sun-dappled pathways. It wasn't just a cemetery; it was a sanctuary, a place where stories whispered on the wind and memories bloomed alongside the wildflowers Silas painstakingly cultivated.

This morning, however, something felt amiss. A shiver danced down Silas’ spine despite the summer warmth. He could have sworn he saw a flicker of movement amidst the mausoleums, a shadow flitting between the ancient oaks. Dismissing it as trickery of the light, he started his daily rounds – weeding rose bushes, trimming hedges, and ensuring each grave was pristine. Yet, the unsettling feeling persisted, gnawing at him like a persistent weed he couldn't quite uproot.
