Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the drumming anxiety in Dr. Amelia Cartwright's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unforgiving glare on the scene before her: a young man, barely out of his teens, slumped in his chair, eyes downcast, hands nervously twisting a crumpled tissue.  His name was Daniel Hayes, and he was the prime suspect in the brutal murder of his own father.

The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Amelia smoothed her already-immaculate navy blazer, took a measured breath, and prepared to delve into the labyrinthine depths of Daniel's mind. She knew that beneath the veneer of youthful vulnerability lay a complex web of emotions, memories, and perhaps even secrets capable of unlocking the truth behind this horrific crime.  This case, she could already tell, would be one of her most challenging yet.
