The bell above the door chimed its familiar melody as Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz wrestled with a particularly stubborn knot in Mrs. Peretti's hair. Outside, the humid New Orleans air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets, a sweet symphony that usually soothed Esme's soul. Today, however, the city's languid charm felt oppressive, mirroring the unease twisting in her gut.

Mrs. Peretti, bless her gossiping heart, was recounting the latest drama unfolding at St. Louis Cathedral, oblivious to Esme's inner turmoil. But Esme couldn't focus on tales of stained glass windows and wayward priests. Her gaze kept drifting towards the antique mirror reflecting the salon's bustling scene: Miss Bernadette getting her weekly perm, young Pierre nervously fidgeting before his first date, and Mr. Dupont snoring softly in the barber chair.

Something felt off. A tremor in the air, a disharmony in the usual rhythm of "Curl Up & Dye." Esme couldn't pinpoint it, but she knew, deep down, that this ordinary Tuesday was about to become anything but.
