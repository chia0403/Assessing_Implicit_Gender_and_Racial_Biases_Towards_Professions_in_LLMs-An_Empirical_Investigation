The pungent aroma of hay mingled with the earthy scent of damp dog fur hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elara Finch.  Her weathered hands, calloused from years of tending creatures great and small, gently stroked the velvety ear of a nervous beagle named Barnaby. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of the ramshackle barn, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. 

Barnaby whimpered, pressing his trembling body closer to Elara's worn denim overalls. The cacophony of barks and meows echoed from the stalls beyond, a symphony of anxiety that mirrored Elara's own churning stomach. Today was the day the Sanctuary faced closure, its fate hanging precariously on the outcome of a last-ditch fundraising effort.
