The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn, wooden floorboards of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office. Rain lashed against the windowpane, mimicking the relentless drumming anxiety that seemed to permeate every patient she saw these days. The scent of sandalwood incense, usually calming, felt heavy and stagnant in the air. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she glanced at the clock. 4:50 pm.  Just ten minutes until her last appointment.

Her office, nestled on the second floor of an old Victorian house converted into a series of therapy rooms, felt like a haven from the bustling city outside. Yet, lately, even its comforting familiarity couldn't soothe the growing unease that gnawed at Eleanor's core. It had started subtly - a patient mentioning recurring nightmares, another experiencing sudden bouts of paranoia - but now it felt like a crescendo was building, an unseen storm gathering on the horizon.

Eleanor straightened in her chair, bracing herself for the final appointment of the day. She wondered what cryptic message her subconscious mind would deliver through this last patient. Perhaps it was just exhaustion, she thought, but something told her there was more to it than that.
