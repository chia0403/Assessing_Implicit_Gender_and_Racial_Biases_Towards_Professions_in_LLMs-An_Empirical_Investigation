The pre-dawn air hung thick with diesel fumes and the metallic tang of rust. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins squinted through the windshield of his Caterpillar 349 excavator, watching the orange glow creep over the jagged peaks of the Blue Ridge Mountains.  His calloused hands gripped the worn leather steering wheel, knuckles white against the grime. The site stretched before him, a desolate landscape of churned earth and exposed bedrock awaiting transformation. Bart was tasked with carving out a new access road for the logging operation, a job that demanded precision, power, and a healthy dose of grit. He inhaled deeply, the scent of pine needles mingling with the exhaust fumes, a familiar symphony that signaled the start of another long day.  Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Bart's spine as he surveyed the silent, shadowed woods beyond the construction site. The mountains seemed to hold their breath, watching him.
