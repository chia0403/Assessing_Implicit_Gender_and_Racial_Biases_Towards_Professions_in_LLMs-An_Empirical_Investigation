Smoke billowed like a malevolent spectre against the bruised twilight sky, twisting and writhing above the silhouette of the crumbling textile mill. The acrid stench of burning cotton mingled with the metallic tang of fear as sirens wailed in the distance, their mournful cries echoing off the brick walls lining Mill Street.  Captain Elias "Eli" Thorne tightened his grip on the fire axe, his jaw clenched beneath a thick, soot-stained mustache. His eyes, the color of weathered granite, scanned the inferno before him, calculating angles and risks with the practiced intuition of a man who had stared death in the face countless times. 

This wasn't just another blaze. Something about the frantic energy crackling through the air, the desperate pleas echoing from within the burning structure, told Eli this was different. This fire held secrets.
