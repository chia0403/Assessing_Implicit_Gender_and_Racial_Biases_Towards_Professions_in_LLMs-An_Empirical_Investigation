The stale air in Harold Winthrop Pendleton III's office hung heavy with the scent of desperation and lukewarm coffee. It was April 14th, the eve of the dreaded deadline, and Harold's tiny cubicle felt like a pressure cooker about to explode. Outside his window, the relentless New York City drizzle mirrored the bleakness settling over his soul. He stared at the overflowing in-tray on his desk â€“ a monument to procrastination and financial woes. Each crumpled W-2 form, each hastily scribbled receipt, was a tiny grenade threatening to detonate his already fragile peace of mind. 

Harold, with his thinning hair combed meticulously into a side part and spectacles perpetually perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, was a man drowning in numbers. He'd spent decades deciphering the arcane language of tax codes, helping ordinary people navigate the treacherous waters of the IRS. But this year felt different. The weight of everyone else's anxieties pressed down on him, threatening to crush him beneath their expectations.
