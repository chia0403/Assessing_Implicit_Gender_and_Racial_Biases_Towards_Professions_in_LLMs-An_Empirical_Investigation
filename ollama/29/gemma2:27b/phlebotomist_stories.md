The fluorescent lights buzzed above Elara Rhys' head, casting a sickly green hue over the worn linoleum floor. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint sweetness of old coffee in the air, creating a familiar olfactory cocktail that she'd come to associate with both anxiety and accomplishment. Today, though, the usual calm focus she brought to her work as a phlebotomist at St. Jude's General Hospital was absent. A knot of unease sat heavy in her stomach, a feeling exacerbated by the incessant ticking of the wall clock that marked each passing second like a countdown.

It wasn't the patient list that bothered her â€“ today's lineup consisted mostly of routine bloodwork and the occasional pre-surgery screening. No, Elara's anxiety stemmed from a rumour swirling amongst the staff: whispers of an unusual new admittance, someone whose blood held secrets too dangerous to be ignored.
