The scent of glue sticks and desperation hung heavy in the air. Amelia Juniper Brightwood, her normally sunny disposition dimmed by a rogue glitter explosion, surveyed the wreckage of her meticulously planned art project. Tiny hands, sticky with paste and boundless enthusiasm, had transformed papier-mâché dinosaurs into abstract sculptures that resembled something out of a fever dream. 

Outside the large kindergarten classroom window, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the playground, painting streaks of gold on the worn asphalt. The rhythmic shrieks of children at play clashed against the persistent buzz of Amelia's dwindling patience. It was only Tuesday, and she already felt like she’d aged a decade. 

Today, she vowed, things would be different. Today, she wouldn't let glitter, glue, or rogue dinosaurs win. Today, Amelia Juniper Brightwood would reclaim her classroom, one perfectly constructed papier-mâché dinosaur at a time.
