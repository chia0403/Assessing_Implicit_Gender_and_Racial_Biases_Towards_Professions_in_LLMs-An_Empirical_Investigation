Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, each drop a miniature hammer blow against the warped glass. Eleanor Vance, her silver hair escaping its bun in rebellious wisps, hunched over her typewriter, the clattering keys a defiant rhythm against the storm's fury. The air hung thick with the scent of dust and aging paper, punctuated by the sharp tang of ink.

Eleanor was on deadline. Her publisher, impatient as ever, had demanded the final chapters of her latest gothic novel, "The Shadow of Ravenscar."  But inspiration, usually a fickle but generous muse, had deserted her. The words refused to flow, replaced by a gnawing anxiety that mirrored the storm raging outside.

She glanced at the half-finished manuscript lying on the rickety desk beside her. The story, set in the gloomy manor house of Ravenscar, was meant to be a chilling tale of family secrets and supernatural encounters. But Eleanor felt adrift, unsure how to navigate the treacherous waters of her own plot. Perhaps she needed a change of scenery. A walk through the storm-tossed moors might clear her head. Or perhaps... she needed something more. Something real to ground her fiction in.

As if summoned by her thoughts, a faint scratching sound arose from the far corner of the attic. Eleanor froze, her heart pounding. The noise came again, sharper this time, like claws on wood. A chill snaked down her spine. Ravenscar was supposed to be fictional... wasn't it?
