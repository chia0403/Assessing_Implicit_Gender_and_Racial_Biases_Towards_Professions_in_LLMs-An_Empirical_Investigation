The midday sun beat down on Elias Stonehand's back, turning the sweat on his brow to a shimmering sheen. He squinted at the massive block of granite before him, its rough surface catching the light in jagged reflections. The quarry hummed with activity - the clang of hammers against chisels, the guttural shouts of men heaving heavy blocks, and the rhythmic screech of cranes hauling stone from the depths of the earth. Elias, however, was oblivious to it all. He was lost in the world within the stone, feeling its ancient energy thrumming beneath his calloused fingertips.

He traced the lines he'd already etched onto the granite with a practiced eye. This block was destined to become the lintel for the grand cathedral being erected in the city of Alderanth, a monument to faith and ambition that would dwarf even the mighty King's Palace. Elias had been chosen for this commission not just because of his skill, but also because of his uncanny ability to see the soul within the stone, to coax forth the beauty hidden beneath its rough exterior.

Today, however, doubt gnawed at him. The weight of expectation pressed down on him like a physical burden. Could he truly do justice to this magnificent piece of granite? Would his work be worthy of gracing such an important edifice?
