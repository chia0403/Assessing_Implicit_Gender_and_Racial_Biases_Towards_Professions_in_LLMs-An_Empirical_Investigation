The air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary in Bartholomew "Bart" Grimble's shop. Dawn light slanted through the grimy windows, illuminating swirls of crimson dust motes dancing above the sawdust-strewn floor. Bart wiped his hands on his bloodstained apron, a tired sigh escaping his lips. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Butcher's Row were just beginning to stir with life, vendors setting up their stalls and children chasing stray cats amongst the overflowing barrels of offal.

Bart wasn't one for mornings. He much preferred the quiet solitude of the night, when he could meticulously carve flesh under the watchful gaze of the moon. But duty called. He had orders to fulfill - a leg of lamb for Mrs. Higgins, sausages for the baker, and a whole hog for the annual feast at St. Bartholomew's.

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease settled in his gut, as sharp as the cleaver he held in his hand. It wasn't just the usual dread that came with handling the carcasses of recently departed creatures. This was a deeper, more insidious feeling, like a cold wind whistling through the cracks in his aging shop.
