The neon sign of the Starlight Diner flickered ominously, casting an eerie green glow across Dalton "Deadeye" McGraw's weathered face. His rig, a behemoth Kenworth W900 nicknamed "Thunderbolt," sat idling in the dusty lot, its chrome gleaming under the pale desert moon. Deadeye, weary from a thousand miles of endless highway, craved nothing more than a plate of greasy fries and a bottomless cup of coffee strong enough to jolt his soul back into gear. He tugged on his worn trucker hat, adjusted his mirrored shades, and trudged towards the diner, the rhythmic squeak of his boots echoing in the stillness of the Nevada night.

The diner's interior was a symphony of faded vinyl booths, flickering fluorescent lights, and the low hum of conversation punctuated by the clanging of dishes. Deadeye slid into a booth by the window, his eyes scanning the room for familiar faces. The usual assortment of truckers, weary travelers, and locals nursing lukewarm coffee filled the space. He caught the eye of Mabel, the diner's gruff but kind owner, who gave him a tired nod before shuffling over to take his order. 

But something felt off tonight. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the cigarette smoke that curled lazily towards the ceiling. Deadeye couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he knew this wasn't just another stop on his endless journey. Something was about to change.
