The ornate brass elevator groaned, its ascent punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of gears older than Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood himself. Teddy hefted a steamer trunk twice his size with practised ease, sweat beading on his brow despite the chill emanating from the marble lobby. The Grand Astoria Hotel was an edifice of faded grandeur; its chandeliers sparkled dim amidst vaulted ceilings adorned with peeling cherubs, and the plush velvet carpets bore the weight of countless forgotten footsteps.

The elevator doors wheezed open onto the seventh floor, revealing a hallway bathed in the muted glow of gaslight sconces. Teddy navigated the labyrinthine corridor with the familiarity of a seasoned sailor charting familiar waters, his keen eye scanning for room numbers. His destination: Suite 703, occupied by Ms. Evangeline Dubois – a notorious socialite known for her lavish parties and even more lavish secrets. Teddy couldn't help but feel a prickle of anticipation; tonight was the night Ms. Dubois threw her annual masquerade ball, and rumour had it this year's festivities promised to be truly unforgettable. 

But as Teddy approached Suite 703, a shiver ran down his spine. The air grew unnaturally cold, and a faint, sweet scent – like decaying roses – wafted through the corridor. Something wasn't right.
