Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the probation office, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Amelia Cartwright's already frayed nerves. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the worn linoleum floor and the overflowing in-tray on her desk.  

Amelia was tired. Bone-tired. Three years as a probation officer in South Central LA had stripped away any romanticized notions she might have once held about social work. It wasn't about rehabilitation or second chances anymore; it was about paperwork, court dates, and the gnawing fear that her efforts were ultimately futile.

A sharp rap on the door startled her.  "Come in," Amelia called out, bracing herself for another client with a sob story and a stack of unpaid fines. Instead, a man in a crisp navy suit stepped inside, his face obscured by the shadows cast by the doorway. "Ms. Cartwright?" he inquired, his voice a low, cultured rumble that seemed out of place in this dingy office. Amelia instinctively straightened in her chair.  Something about this man, something in his measured tone and unwavering gaze, told her this wasn't just another routine visit.
