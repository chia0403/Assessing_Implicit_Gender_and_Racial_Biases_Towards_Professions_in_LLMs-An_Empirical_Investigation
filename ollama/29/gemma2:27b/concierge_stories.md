Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the cobblestones below. The air smelled of damp earth and coal smoke, a quintessential London evening. Inside, however, warmth emanated from the crackling fireplace in the lobby, casting flickering shadows across the opulent marble floor and plush velvet armchairs.

Eloise Cavendish, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, straightened her crisp navy uniform with a practiced hand. As head concierge of the Grand Blackwood for the past decade, she was a master of anticipating guests' needs before they even voiced them. Her sharp blue eyes scanned the lobby, taking note of the weary businessman slumped over his newspaper, the giggling young couple sharing stolen kisses by the fireplace, and the elderly matron fussing with her oversized handbag.

Eloise prided herself on providing an unparalleled experience for every guest who crossed the threshold of the Grand Blackwood.  But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as a figure emerged from the swirling rain, their face obscured by the deep shadows of a hooded cloak. This was no ordinary guest. Eloise could sense it in the air, thick with anticipation and an underlying current of somethingâ€¦dangerous.
