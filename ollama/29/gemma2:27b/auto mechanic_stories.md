The rusted wrench slipped in Elara Vance’s grease-stained hand, clattering against the concrete floor of her garage.  A sigh escaped her lips as she bent to retrieve it, the scent of motor oil and gasoline thick in the air. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly, turning the corrugated iron roof into a shimmering furnace. It was July, and even the cicadas seemed to be wilting under the heat.

Elara wiped the sweat from her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of grime across her forehead. Her garage, nestled on the edge of Dusty Creek, was more than just a place of work – it was a sanctuary, a refuge from the dust and gossip that swirled through the small desert town. Here, amongst the hulking engines and scattered tools, she felt at peace.  

But today, even the comforting rumble of her latest project, a vintage Ford Mustang, couldn't soothe her mounting anxiety. A letter lay on her workbench, crisp and official-looking, threatening to upend her carefully constructed life.
