The insistent chirping of his pager tore Dr. Alistair Finch from a dream filled with tangled arteries and pulsating organs – not an unusual occurrence for a man who spent his waking hours navigating the labyrinthine landscape of the human body. He fumbled for the device on the bedside table, squinting at the harsh red light that pierced through the pre-dawn gloom. 

*Code Blue - OR 3.* The message was blunt, urgent. Alistair's stomach clenched. Code Blues were a surgeon's crucible – moments of raw intensity where every decision could mean life or death. He swung his legs over the side of the bed, already mentally running through potential scenarios. What kind of trauma? Was it a patient he recognized?

His apartment overlooked the bustling cityscape of Chicago, but Alistair barely registered the twinkling lights below. His mind was already racing towards Northwestern Memorial Hospital, his second home, a sanctuary of gleaming steel and antiseptic scent where he wielded his scalpel with the precision of an artist and the unwavering focus of a warrior.
