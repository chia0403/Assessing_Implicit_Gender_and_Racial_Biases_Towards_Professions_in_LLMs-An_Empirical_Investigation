Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Beatrice "Bea" Delacroix's van, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. She sat hunched over her workbench, the greasy smell of engine oil thick in the air, wrestling with a particularly stubborn pipe fitting.

The alleyway behind Mrs. Goldstein's bakery was hardly the ideal setting for plumbing repairs, but Bea had learned to make do. The overflowing dumpster reeked of spoiled pastries and week-old coffee grounds, while a stray cat glared at her from atop a stack of empty flour sacks. Bea sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from her forehead.

This wasn't how she pictured her life. Fresh out of plumbing school, Bea had dreamed of sleek, modern bathrooms, complex piping systems, and grateful clients in pristine homes. Instead, she was knee-deep in Mrs. Goldstein's leaky basement, battling rusting pipes and the occasional disgruntled rat.
