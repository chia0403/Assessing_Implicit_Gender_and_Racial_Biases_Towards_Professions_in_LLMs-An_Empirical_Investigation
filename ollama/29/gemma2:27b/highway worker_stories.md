The asphalt shimmered under the relentless July sun, radiating heat like a griddle. Sweat stung Elias Blackwood's eyes as he heaved another chunk of concrete onto the truck bed. The air hung thick with the scent of diesel fumes and burnt rubber, punctuated by the insistent honking of impatient drivers stuck in the lane closure. 

Elias wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, squinting at the endless ribbon of highway stretching before him. He'd been working this stretch for weeks, repairing a section damaged by last spring's freak hailstorm.  The monotonous clang of hammers and the rumble of passing trucks were the soundtrack to his days, punctuated only by the occasional crackle of static from his handheld radio. 


He wasn't sure he liked being stuck on this job; it felt like an eternity in a sun-baked purgatory. He longed for the cool shade of the mountains, the rushing waters of the nearby creek, anything but this endless expanse of asphalt and frustrated drivers.
