The fluorescent hum of the office lights buzzed in Eleanor Finch's ears, competing with the rhythmic scrape of her mechanical pencil against vellum paper. Outside the window, rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already drab cityscape into an impressionistic wash of grey and silver.

Her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously translated the architect's vision into precise lines and dimensions. The project – a sleek, modern apartment complex slated for the gentrifying waterfront – felt like a million miles away from the cramped, cluttered cubicle she called an office. 

She longed for fresh air, for the scent of salt and seaweed instead of stale coffee and printer toner.  But for now, Eleanor was content to escape into the world she created on her drafting table, a world of straight lines and perfect angles, where imagination reigned supreme.
