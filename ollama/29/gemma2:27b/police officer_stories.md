Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Elijah "Eli" Thorne's office, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the city outside. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and wet wool – a testament to Eli's sleepless night spent poring over case files. His desk was a battlefield of crumpled papers, photographs, and empty takeout containers, illuminated by the sickly yellow light of a single overhead bulb. A sigh escaped his lips as he rubbed his weary eyes, the lines around them deepening like cracks in parched earth.

Tonight, the city held its breath, shrouded in an unnerving stillness punctuated only by the relentless drumming of rain. The streets below were deserted, save for a lone taxi splashing through puddles and the occasional shadowy figure darting between alleys. Eli knew that beneath this veneer of calm, something sinister lurked – a darkness he was all too familiar with, but one that seemed to be growing ever more insidious. 

The phone on his desk buzzed, shattering the silence. Eli snatched it up, already bracing himself for whatever grim news awaited him. "Thorne," he growled into the receiver, his voice rough from disuse.
