The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez, casting a sterile glow over the stainless steel instruments laid out on the tray beside her. The familiar scent of antiseptic and mint toothpaste hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually signaled the start of another busy day at Sunshine Smiles Dental. But today felt different. A shiver ran down Esme's spine as she glanced at the clock â€“ 10:47 AM.  Exactly ten minutes until the new patient arrived.

This wasn't just any appointment; this was the first time in her seven years as a hygienist that Esme had been assigned a patient with a direct referral from Dr. Blackwood himself. The renowned dentist rarely recommended specific patients, so Esme knew this one must be special.  She adjusted her mask and gloves, her heart pounding like a runaway drill, wondering what mystery awaited behind the closed door marked "Room 3."
