Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. Eleanor Ainsworth sighed, her breath fogging the already obscured view. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile pallor over the cluttered desk in front of her. File folders overflowed with case notes and legal documents, their contents swirling like memories she couldn't quite grasp.

It was a messy divorce, involving accusations of infidelity, hidden assets, and a particularly vindictive poodle named Duchess. 


Eleanor ran a hand through her already dishevelled bun, wishing she hadn't skipped dinner. The rumble in her stomach competed with the insistent drumming of the rain. Outside, the city groaned under the weight of the storm, but inside Eleanor's tiny cubicle, the only thing groaning was her overworked mind, struggling to decipher legal jargon and untangle a web of conflicting testimonies.
