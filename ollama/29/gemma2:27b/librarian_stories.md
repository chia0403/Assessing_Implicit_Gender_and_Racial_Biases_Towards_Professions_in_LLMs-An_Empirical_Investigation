Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Blackwood Library, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the cobblestones below. Inside, Emilia Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles, their silver frames reflecting the warm glow of the gas lamps that illuminated the cavernous space. The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint mustiness of forgotten things. Emilia ran a hand over the spine of a leather-bound volume, its title – "The Folklore of Forgotten Villages" – embossed in faded gold. 

A shiver ran down her spine despite the library's cozy warmth. The storm outside seemed to mirror the unease stirring within her. For weeks, strange occurrences had plagued the Blackwood Library: books mysteriously misplaced, whispers echoing from empty aisles, and a faint, floral scent lingering in the air – a scent she couldn't quite place.
