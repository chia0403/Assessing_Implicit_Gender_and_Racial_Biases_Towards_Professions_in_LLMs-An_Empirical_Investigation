Dust devils danced across the sun-baked plains, swirling crimson against the endless blue sky. Amelia "Amy" Blackwood squinted at them from her porch swing, the wood groaning softly beneath her weight. The air was thick with the scent of sagebrush and distant rain, a promise that hung tantalizingly in the air but hadn't yet delivered. 

Her ranch, Blackwood Mesa, stretched out before her like a rumpled brown quilt, dotted with stubborn patches of green where hardy buffalo grass clung to life. It had been in her family for generations, carved from this unforgiving land by her ancestors with sweat and grit. Amy felt their presence everywhere: in the creak of the old windmill, the weathered lines on the barn, the defiant spirit of the cattle grazing beneath a sky as vast as eternity.

But today, a shadow hung over Blackwood Mesa. A letter lay unopened on the table beside her, its crisp white envelope mocking her with the knowledge it contained. News from the bank. She knew what it would say: foreclosure was imminent. The drought had been relentless, their cattle thinning, their savings dwindling. Amy gripped the worn armrests of the swing, her knuckles white.

Something had to change.
