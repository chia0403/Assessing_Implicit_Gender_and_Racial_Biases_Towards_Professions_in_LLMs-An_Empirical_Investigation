The cicadas thrummed their relentless song, a buzzing counterpoint to the rhythmic drone of Elias Blackwood's lawnmower as he traversed Mrs. Hathaway's sprawling emerald lawn. Sweat beaded on his forehead, stinging his eyes despite the worn brim of his baseball cap. July in Charleston, South Carolina was a crucible, forging sweat and determination in equal measure.  Elias, with his calloused hands and sun-kissed skin, knew this crucible well.

He paused the mower, letting the scent of freshly cut grass mingle with the heavy perfume of magnolia blossoms wafting from the nearby courtyard. This wasn't just any yard; it was a testament to generations of meticulous care, a living tapestry woven with ancient oaks, vibrant azaleas, and rambling rose bushes. Elias felt a quiet pride in tending to this legacy, his hands shaping the landscape as surely as the architects had shaped the grand Victorian mansion that presided over it all.  

But today, something was different. A tension crackled in the humid air, a discordant note amidst the symphony of cicadas and birdsong. It started with a shiver down Elias' spine, followed by an unsettling sense of being watched. He glanced up at the windows of the mansion, their leaded glass reflecting the summer sun in shimmering shards.  Empty, just as they always were. Or were they?
