The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to taste, as Elara Vance adjusted the strap of her battered leather camera bag. Cicadas buzzed in the overgrown bamboo grove, their incessant thrumming echoing through the abandoned temple grounds. Sunbeams pierced the tangled canopy, casting fractured patterns of light and shadow on moss-covered stone statues. 

Elara inhaled deeply, savouring the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves mingled with the sweet fragrance of jasmine blooming near the crumbling entranceway. This forgotten corner of Laos held a magnetic pull for her, a place where time seemed to stand still. Abandoned by worshippers centuries ago, the temple now whispered stories of a past she longed to capture through her lens.
