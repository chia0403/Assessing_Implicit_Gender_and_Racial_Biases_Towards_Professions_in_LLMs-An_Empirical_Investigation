Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Davenport's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the stacks of college applications piled precariously on her desk. Each one represented a dream, a future teetering on the precipice of uncertainty.  Eleanor, with her greying bun and spectacles perched halfway down her nose, felt the weight of those dreams acutely.

The small town of Oakhaven nestled snugly amidst rolling hills and whispering pines. Life moved at a slower pace here, but for Eleanor, time always seemed to slip through her fingers like grains of sand. Today was college decision day, a day fraught with anxiety for both students and counselors. As the clock ticked relentlessly towards noon, she braced herself for the inevitable rollercoaster of emotions that would soon unfold.
