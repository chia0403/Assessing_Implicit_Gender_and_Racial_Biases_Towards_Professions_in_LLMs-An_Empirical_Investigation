Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic, mirroring the tempest raging within him. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and despair. Outside, the neon glow of the pawn shop across the street flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows that danced on the peeling paint of his waiting room. This wasn't how Elias envisioned his life - tending to the wounded in a ramshackle building nestled in the heart of Havenwood's forgotten underbelly. 

He yearned for the sterile gleam of a city hospital, the symphony of beeping monitors, and the camaraderie of colleagues who understood the weight he carried on his shoulders. But Havenwood had a way of claiming souls, trapping them in its web of desperation and decay. And Elias, with his unwavering empathy and calloused hands, was no exception.
