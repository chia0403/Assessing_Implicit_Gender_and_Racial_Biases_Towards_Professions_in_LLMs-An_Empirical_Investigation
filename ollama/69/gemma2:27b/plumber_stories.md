The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Barnaby Thistlewick's workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. The air hung thick with the smell of mildew, damp earth, and something vaguely metallic – perhaps leftover copper from his last job. Outside, a tempest raged, turning the usually sleepy lane into a raging torrent. 

Barnaby himself wasn't fazed by the weather. He was elbow-deep in a bathtub, wrestling with a particularly stubborn drainpipe. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, mixing with the grime already staining his face.  He grunted, heaving on the pipe. "Come on you blighter," he muttered, his voice hoarse from shouting instructions over the howling wind all morning.

Suddenly, a sharp rap at the workshop door startled him. He wiped his hands on a greasy rag and trudged towards the sound, leaving the bathtub momentarily forgotten.  He peered through the rain-streaked glass pane – a silhouette stood huddled on his doorstep.
