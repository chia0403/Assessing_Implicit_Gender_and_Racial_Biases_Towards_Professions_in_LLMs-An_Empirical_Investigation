The midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the community center parking lot. Cicadas thrummed in the nearby oak trees, their monotonous song blending with the distant whine of lawnmowers. Emilia Sanchez, RD, sighed, her shoulders slumping as she surveyed the empty chairs arranged in a semicircle beneath the shaded awning. This was supposed to be her first "Healthy Eating on a Budget" workshop, a chance to share her passion for nutrition with her community.  So far, though, it seemed no one shared her enthusiasm.

Emilia tugged at the collar of her brightly colored blouse, feeling a bead of sweat trickle down her temple. Maybe the flyers hadn't been clear enough? Or perhaps the timing was wrong. A pang of disappointment stabbed at her. She had poured hours into planning this workshop, carefully crafting recipes and budgeting tips tailored to the needs of the neighborhood.  

Suddenly, a flash of bright yellow caught Emilia's eye. A beat-up scooter chugged into the parking lot, its lone rider maneuvering it with surprising agility. As the rider dismounted, Emilia saw it was a young boy, no older than ten, his face smudged with dirt and his grin wide as the summer sky. He hopped off the scooter and skipped towards her, clutching a dented metal lunchbox in his hand.
