Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elara Vance's office, blurring the glittering cityscape below into an impressionist painting. Elara, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight braid, chewed on the end of her pen, frustration furrowing her brow as she stared at the blueprints spread across her desk. The building, a sleek, modern museum destined to house a priceless collection of ancient artifacts, was refusing to cooperate. Angles were off, spaces felt cramped, and the light shaft designed to illuminate the central atrium just wasn't working. 

Elara, renowned for her innovative designs and ability to breathe life into concrete and steel, was stumped. She paced the length of her office, a sleek, minimalist space echoing the architectural style she favored. The rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock on the wall only served to amplify the silence in her head. This project, commissioned by the enigmatic philanthropist Alistair Thorne, was supposed to be her magnum opus, a crowning achievement in her already illustrious career. Instead, it felt like a lead weight dragging her down. 

Suddenly, a sharp knock startled her from her reverie. "Come in," she called out, straightening her posture and attempting to compose herself. The door creaked open, revealing Amelia, her ever-reliable assistant, holding a steaming cup of tea.  "Thought you might need this, Elara," Amelia said softly, placing the mug on her desk. 

Elara smiled gratefully. "You're a lifesaver, Amelia. Thank you." Taking a sip of the fragrant Earl Grey, she sighed. "This museumâ€¦it's just not coming together the way I envisioned it."
