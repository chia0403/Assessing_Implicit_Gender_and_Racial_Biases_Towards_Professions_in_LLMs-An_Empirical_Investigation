Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's office, blurring the neon glow of the city beyond into an impressionistic smear. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation - the two constants in Izzy's life lately. Papers overflowed from her desk, each one a testament to another unsolved case, another victim whose cries for justice echoed unanswered. Tonight, though, Izzy had a glimmer of hope. A tip, whispered through the back alleys of her precinct, pointed towards a lead in the string of jewelry store robberies plaguing the city.  

The clock ticked past midnight, mocking her with the lost hours she'd spent pouring over evidence. Outside, sirens wailed, their mournful cry adding to the symphony of the city's underbelly. Izzy grabbed her worn leather jacket, its collar frayed from countless nights chasing shadows.  Tonight, she was going hunting.
