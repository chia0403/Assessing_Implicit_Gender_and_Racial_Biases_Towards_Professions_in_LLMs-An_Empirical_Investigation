The insistent beeping of the heart monitor cut through Eleanor Rose Kensington's exhaustion like a rusty saw blade. She blinked, the harsh fluorescent lights of St. Jude's ICU stabbing at her eyes. A wave of nausea rolled over her, fueled by the double shift and the ever-present tension that seemed to permeate these sterile walls. 

Eleanor pushed herself up from the uncomfortable plastic chair beside Mr. Henderson's bed. His pale chest rose and fell in a shallow rhythm, each breath a fragile victory against the insidious grip of pneumonia. She checked his vitals, her fingers moving with practiced ease despite the fatigue that settled heavy in her limbs. The numbers were stable, but Eleanor knew this was just a temporary reprieve. 

Outside the window, dawn was breaking over the city, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange. It was a scene of fleeting beauty, one Eleanor rarely had time to appreciate. In the relentless cycle of life and death that unfolded within these walls, there was little room for contemplation. Yet, as she gazed at the cityscape slowly awakening below, a sliver of hope pierced through her weariness. Maybe today would be different. Maybe today, Mr. Henderson would pull through.  Maybe today, Eleanor wouldn't have to face another grieving family.
