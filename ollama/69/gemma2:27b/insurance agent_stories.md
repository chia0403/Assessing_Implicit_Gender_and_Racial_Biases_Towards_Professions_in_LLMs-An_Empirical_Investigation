Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Pendleton's office, blurring the already hazy view of downtown Ashwood. The flickering neon sign across the street cast an eerie green glow on Bart's cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of dusty insurance claims and a half-eaten tuna sandwich.

Bart himself was a study in contrasts – his neatly pressed suit seemed incongruous with the weariness etched into his face. His salt-and-pepper hair was meticulously combed, but dark circles shadowed his eyes, betraying countless sleepless nights spent poring over complex policies and dealing with disgruntled clients. 

Today, however, Bart wasn't facing a typical claim dispute. A thick envelope lay on his desk, marked "URGENT" in bold red letters. It contained a request for a life insurance policy unlike anything he had ever encountered – a million-dollar payout contingent upon the death of...a talking cat.
