The sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's weathered neck as he surveyed his cornfield. Each stalk stood tall and proud, their emerald leaves rustling like whispered promises in the summer breeze. The air hung heavy with the scent of freshly turned earth and the sweet, cloying perfume of blooming honeysuckle.  Silas wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his calloused hand, a deep furrow etched between his salt-and-pepper eyebrows.

He'd been farming this land for over forty years, ever since he was a young lad helping his Pa. The rolling hills of Kentucky, dotted with ancient oak trees and meandering streams, were in his blood. This wasn't just his livelihood; it was his legacy. But lately, Silas had been feeling the weight of that legacy pressing down on him like a millstone.
