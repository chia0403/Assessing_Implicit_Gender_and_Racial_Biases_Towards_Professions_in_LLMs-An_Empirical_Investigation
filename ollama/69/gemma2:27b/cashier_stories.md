The flickering fluorescent lights above cast Elara Thistlewick's face in an alternating dance of shadow and sickly yellow. Her fingers tapped a staccato rhythm against the worn countertop, a counterpoint to the tinny pop song blaring from the ceiling speakers.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and overripe bananas, a familiar perfume for anyone who spent their days surrounded by aisles overflowing with discounted cereal boxes and dented cans of soup. Elara sighed, her gaze drifting towards the clock above the entrance â€“ 3:47 PM.

Just three more hours until she could escape the fluorescent dungeon of Bargain Bonanza and retreat to the relative peace of her tiny apartment, a sanctuary filled with well-worn books and the comforting aroma of cinnamon candles. But for now, she was trapped, her smile plastered on like a cheap mask as she waited for the next weary customer to stumble through the automatic doors.
