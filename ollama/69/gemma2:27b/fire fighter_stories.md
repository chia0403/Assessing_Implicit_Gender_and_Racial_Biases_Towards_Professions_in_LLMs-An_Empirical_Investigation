The siren wailed like a banshee, its piercing cry tearing through Amelia "Amy" Reyes' dreams.  She bolted upright in bed, heart hammering against her ribs. Smoke. The acrid smell hit her nose even before the dispatch call crackled through her radio on the nightstand. She grabbed her gear, already knowing this was no ordinary fire.

The air hung thick and heavy with humidity as Amy sprinted out of the firehouse, the heat a palpable force pressing against her skin.  Flames danced wildly in the distance, illuminating the pre-dawn sky over the sleepy seaside town of Oakhaven. The familiar scent of salt mingled with the acrid sting of smoke, creating a disorienting cocktail that set her nerves on edge.

This wasn't just any house fire. It was the old Victorian mansion perched atop Widow's Hill, a local landmark shrouded in whispers and legends.  Amy knew they said it was haunted, but right now, all she cared about were the lives trapped inside.
