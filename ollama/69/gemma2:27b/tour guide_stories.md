The humid Bangkok air clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin as he navigated the crowded Chao Phraya River pier. Tuk-tuks zipped past, their horns blaring a chaotic symphony, while vendors hawked everything from mangoes sticky with sweet rice to intricately carved wooden Buddhas. Elias, with his sun-bleached hair tucked under a worn straw hat and a smile permanently etched on his tanned face, weaved through the throngs effortlessly. He was a Bangkok native, born and raised amidst the city's vibrant chaos, and knew its hidden alleys and bustling markets like the back of his hand. 

Today, he was leading a group of ten wide-eyed tourists, their faces flushed with excitement and tinged with trepidation. Their cameras clicked incessantly, capturing the kaleidoscope of sights and sounds that assaulted their senses: saffron-robed monks gliding past on bicycles, vendors frying pungent street food over sizzling woks, and ornate temples shimmering under the afternoon sun.

Elias paused, his hand outstretched towards a rickety wooden boat bobbing gently in the murky water. "This," he announced with a flourish, "is our chariot to Ayutthaya, the ancient capital of Siam." The tourists murmured in anticipation, their eyes fixed on the dilapidated vessel. Little did they know that this seemingly innocuous journey held a secret, one that would unravel Elias's carefully constructed facade and plunge them all into a treacherous web of ancient curses and hidden treasures.
