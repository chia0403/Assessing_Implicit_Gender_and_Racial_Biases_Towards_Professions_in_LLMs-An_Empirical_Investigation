The insistent chirp of his phone alarm pierced through Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's dream, shattering the image of a sun-drenched beach into a thousand glittering shards.  Groaning, she slapped at the nightstand, silencing the incessant chirping before it could drive her entirely mad. 

Outside, the relentless hum of New York City traffic already throbbed, a symphony of horns and sirens that served as a daily reminder of the chaos just beyond her apartment door. Amy took a deep breath, willing herself to rise from the cocoon of her sheets. Her tiny Brooklyn studio was bathed in the soft, pre-dawn light filtering through the sheer curtains. 

Today was a particularly crucial day.  A new patient, one shrouded in mystery and whispered rumors, was scheduled for his first session. Dr. Julian Thorne had requested absolute discretion, insisting on being referred to simply as "Mr. Thorne" during their sessions.  His file, brief but unsettling, spoke of a man grappling with a past so dark it threatened to consume him entirely. Amy's curiosity warred with a prickle of unease. This was not her usual clientele - she typically dealt with the anxieties and neuroses of everyday life. But Mr. Thorne's case felt different, charged with a palpable weight that promised to test her skills like never before.
