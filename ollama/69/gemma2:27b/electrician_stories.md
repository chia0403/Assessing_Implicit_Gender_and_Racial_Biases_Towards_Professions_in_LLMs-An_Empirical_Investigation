The humid New Orleans air hung thick and heavy, carrying with it the scent of jasmine and beignets.  Sweat trickled down Silas Montgomery's neck as he wrestled with a stubborn junction box high on the wall of an old Creole townhouse. The flickering light from his headlamp cast grotesque shadows that danced around him, making the ornate plasterwork seem to writhe. Outside, cicadas screamed their incessant chorus, punctuated by the distant rumble of a streetcar. Silas sighed, feeling the familiar ache in his knees from years spent hunched over wires and circuits. This house, like so many others in the French Quarter, was a labyrinthine puzzle of outdated wiring and hidden surprises.

He'd been called in to fix a blown fuse, a seemingly simple task. But as always with these old buildings, nothing was straightforward. The wiring was a chaotic mess, spliced and re-spliced over decades, defying all logic and building codes. Silas suspected the previous owner, a flamboyant artist known for his wild parties, hadn't been overly concerned with electrical safety.  He tightened a screw, muttering a curse under his breath as another loose wire sparked dangerously close to his fingers. 


This was just another day in the life of Silas Montgomery, master electrician and unofficial guardian of the Quarter's flickering lights. He knew these buildings like the back of his hand, their secrets whispered through the hum of power lines and the ghostly flicker of old-fashioned bulbs.  But tonight, something felt different. A shiver ran down his spine, a prickle of unease he couldn't shake off. The air grew colder, despite the oppressive humidity, and the cicadas suddenly fell silent. Silas glanced around the shadowy room, half expecting to see something out of place, a glimpse of movement in the corner of his eye. He was alone, but he couldn't help feeling watched.
