Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia Blackwood's attic apartment, mimicking the tempest brewing within her. The manuscript lay open on her cluttered desk, a testament to weeks of frustration. Every sentence felt hollow, every plot twist predictable. Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the fog-choked streets of Victorian London, refused to come alive.

But this time, the words felt lifeless, lacking the spark that usually ignited her imagination.  She needed inspiration, a jolt to her creative system.

Curiosity piqued, she grabbed her worn tweed coat and descended the creaking stairs, the promise of a distraction pulling her from the writer's block that threatened to consume her.
