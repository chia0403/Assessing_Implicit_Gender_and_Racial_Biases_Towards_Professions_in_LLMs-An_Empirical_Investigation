The wind whipped across the dusty plains, biting at Elara Jane Cartwright's face as she surveyed her herd. The sun, already high in the turquoise Montana sky, cast long shadows from the scraggly cottonwoods lining the creek bed. Dust devils danced on the horizon, teasing the cattle with promises of a distant storm.

Elara tugged her Stetson lower, shielding her eyes from the glare. Years spent under this unforgiving sun had etched lines around them, mirroring the deep furrows carved into the parched earth. She knew these lands like the back of her hand, every ridge, every gully, every whispering wind carrying the scent of sagebrush and something wilder, something untamed.  

Today, though, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, heavy and unsettling. The cattle were restless, their lowing laced with unease. Even her trusty dog, a grizzled Border Collie named Jasper, whined softly at her side, his ears flattened against his skull. 

Elara's gut twisted with a premonition she couldn't quite name. Whatever was coming wouldn't be good.
