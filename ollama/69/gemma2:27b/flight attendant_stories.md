The recycled air hung heavy with the scent of anxiety and stale peanuts. Amelia Rose Cartwright smoothed down her crisp blue uniform for what felt like the hundredth time, her reflection wavering in the scratched surface of the galley door. Outside, the Boeing 737 shuddered, jostled by unseen turbulence as it climbed through the bruised twilight sky. The fasten seatbelt sign remained stubbornly illuminated.

Amelia had been a flight attendant for five years, but she still felt that familiar knot of apprehension whenever they hit rough air. It wasn't fear, exactly. More like a deep-seated awareness of the precariousness of their situation â€“ hurtling through the atmosphere in a metal tube, suspended thousands of feet above the earth. 

Tonight, Amelia was working the Miami to London route. The passengers were a mixed bag: a group of boisterous college students on a spring break adventure, a pair of anxious honeymooners clutching hands, and several solitary business travelers with their laptops clutched like lifelines.
