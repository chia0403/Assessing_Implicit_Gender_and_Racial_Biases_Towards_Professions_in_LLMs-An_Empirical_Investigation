The amber glow of the bourbon streetlamps reflected in Thaddeus "Teddy" Blackwood's weary eyes. Rain lashed against the windows of The Rusty Tap, blurring the neon sign and casting long shadows across the worn oak bar. Teddy wiped down a sticky patch with a sigh, the scent of spilled beer and stale peanuts hanging heavy in the air. Another Tuesday night in Port Blossom, a town where time seemed to move slower than the Mississippi River itself, its currents choked by forgotten dreams and faded glory. 

Teddy glanced at the lone figure slumped at the end of the bar - a woman with fiery red hair tucked under a battered fedora, her face obscured by shadow.  She'd been nursing a glass of rye for the past hour, silent and still as a statue carved from grief. He wondered what story she held, what storm had blown her into The Rusty Tap on this dreary night.
