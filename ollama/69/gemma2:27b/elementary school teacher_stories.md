Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eloise Hawthorne's second-grade classroom, mimicking the chaotic drumming her heart performed beneath her neatly pressed blouse. A storm raged outside, but the true tempest brewed within. Twenty pairs of wide, curious eyes stared up at her from behind miniature desks decorated with lopsided construction paper animals and glitter glue masterpieces.

Eloise swallowed, forcing down the lump in her throat. Today was supposed to be ordinary. Story time, followed by math drills and a rousing game of "Red Rover" during recess. Instead, it was anything but ordinary. A letter had arrived that morning – crisp white with an official-looking seal – announcing the imminent closure of St. Augustine's Elementary. Eloise's beloved haven for young minds, her sanctuary built on crayon drawings and whispered secrets, was to vanish before the school year ended.
