The midday sun sliced through the dusty windows of Room 105, casting shimmering squares across the alphabet rug. Emilia Cartwright, her blonde ponytail escaping its elastic, surveyed the scene with a sigh. Crayons littered the floor like fallen autumn leaves, blocks formed precarious towers that threatened to topple at any moment, and the air hummed with the chaotic symphony of five-year-olds on the brink of afternoon nap time. 

Today, however, Emilia felt a strange unease settling in her stomach. It wasn't the usual pre-naptime frenzy – this was different. Something felt...off. A shiver ran down her spine as she remembered the peculiar email she’d received that morning: a message from an unknown sender, simply containing the words "Room 105. Be careful."
