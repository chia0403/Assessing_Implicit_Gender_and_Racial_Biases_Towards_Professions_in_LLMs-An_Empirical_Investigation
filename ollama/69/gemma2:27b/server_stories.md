The aroma of sizzling garlic butter and rosemary hung heavy in the air, mingling with the low hum of conversation and clinking silverware. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance weaved through the crowded tables of La Bella Luna, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun that threatened to unravel with each hurried step.

La Bella Luna was a bustling Italian restaurant nestled on a cobblestone street in Boston's North End. The brick walls were adorned with faded photographs of smiling families and rustic scenes from Tuscany, while strings of twinkling lights cast a warm glow over the intimate dining space. Ellie, with her quick wit and even quicker reflexes, navigated the labyrinthine tables with practiced ease, balancing trays laden with steaming plates of pasta and delicate glasses of Chianti.

But tonight, something felt different. A tension crackled beneath the surface of the usual Friday night energy. A group of men huddled in a booth near the back, their voices hushed but laced with an unmistakable urgency. Ellie couldn't help but steal glances towards them, her curiosity piqued.
