The aroma of lavender and rosemary oil, usually calming, felt oppressive in the cramped space. Outside, the neon sign of "Anya's Touch" flickered weakly, struggling against the onslaught of the storm. Anya glanced at the empty massage table, its soft linen wrinkled like a forgotten sigh.

Rent was due next week, and Anya's savings were dwindling faster than the rain outside.
