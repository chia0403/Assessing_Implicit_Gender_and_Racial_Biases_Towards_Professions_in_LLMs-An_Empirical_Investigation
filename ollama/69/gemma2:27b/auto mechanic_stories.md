The rusty groan of the ancient Chevy Impala's engine echoed through Elias "Eli" Blackwood's garage, a symphony only he truly appreciated. Sunlight streamed through dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the humid Georgia air. The scent of motor oil and gasoline hung heavy, a familiar comfort to Eli. Outside, cicadas buzzed their relentless summer song, punctuated by the occasional honk from passing trucks on Highway 28.

Eli wiped grease-stained hands on his faded denim overalls, squinting under the Impala's hood. This beauty, a cherry red relic from the 60s, was giving him trouble - again. Its engine sputtered and coughed like an old man with a bad chest cold. Eli chuckled, knowing he had his work cut out for him. He loved these vintage cars, their quirks and character reminding him of simpler times.

But lately, things were far from simple. The weight of keeping Blackwood's Garage afloat pressed heavily on Eli's shoulders. Business was slow, and the town's younger generation seemed more interested in shiny new SUVs than his beloved classics.
