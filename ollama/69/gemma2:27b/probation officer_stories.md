Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Penelope "Penny" Thorne's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  She stared at the file on her desk, a faded manila folder emblazoned with the name "Ethan Hayes." His parole hearing was in three days, and Penny couldn't shake the feeling that something was deeply wrong. Ethan, a young man convicted of petty theft and vandalism, had been a model probationer for the past year. He attended all his meetings, held down a steady job at a local diner, and even volunteered at a homeless shelter. Yet, a nagging intuition told Penny there was more to the story, a hidden layer beneath Ethan's carefully constructed facade.

The setting sun cast long shadows across her cluttered office, highlighting the chipped paint and worn-out carpet. This small, windowless room in the basement of the overcrowded probation department building felt as bleak and claustrophobic as her current state of mind. 


Penny took a deep breath, trying to quell the rising anxiety. She needed answers. She needed to know if Ethan was truly on the path to redemption or if she was about to recommend the release of someone who posed a danger to himself and others.
