The insistent chime of the shop bell sliced through Iris Evangeline Bellweather's concentration as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn chrysanthemum stem. She sighed, her breath fogging the cool glass of the display case, before straightening and smoothing down her dusty green apron. "Good morning!" she chirped, forcing a smile as wide and welcoming as the sunflowers that flanked the doorway.

It was 8:02 am on a Tuesday, which meant only one thing – Mrs. Henderson from across the street was likely in need of another lily bouquet for her perpetually ailing cat, Mr. Whiskers. Iris braced herself for the inevitable onslaught of questions regarding the symbolism of lilies and whether they were suitable for felines (they weren't).

The bell chimed again, this time followed by a gust of wind that ruffled Iris's unruly auburn curls. A stranger stood framed in the doorway, his silhouette shrouded by the morning mist swirling outside. He wore a long, dark coat that seemed incongruous with the burgeoning spring weather, and his face was obscured by the brim of a fedora. The air around him crackled with an unfamiliar energy – a blend of intrigue and something unsettling Iris couldn't quite place.  

"Can I help you?" she asked, her voice betraying a flicker of nervousness.
