The incessant beeping of the EKG monitor grated on Elara Blackwood's nerves like fingernails on a chalkboard. Rain lashed against the windows of the small rural clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. 

She'd been a physician's assistant in this sleepy mountain town for five years, and she loved it - the close-knit community, the breathtaking scenery, the genuine gratitude of her patients. But lately, something felt off. A weariness had settled into her bones, a gnawing sense of restlessness that no amount of fresh mountain air could dispel. 

Tonight, the feeling was amplified.  The clinic's only doctor, Dr. Thomas, was out on an emergency call, leaving Elara alone with a patient who was rapidly deteriorating.  His name was Caleb Hayes, a gruff but kind logger who had stumbled into the clinic earlier that evening complaining of chest pain. Now, his face was pale and clammy, sweat beading on his forehead. The EKG monitor's erratic rhythm pulsed like a warning drumbeat.


Elara needed to act fast, but fear threatened to paralyze her. Could she handle this alone?  Or would Caleb become another casualty in the unforgiving grip of the mountains?
