The rain hammered against Dr. Elias Finch’s office window, each drop a tiny explosion of sound in the quiet space.  It was the kind of relentless downpour that mirrored the storm raging inside Amelia Hayes, curled tightly on the plush armchair opposite him. Her blonde hair, usually bouncing with life, lay limp and plastered to her forehead. She hadn't looked up from her clasped hands since she entered, her breath coming in shallow, uneven gasps.

Elias’s office was a haven of warmth and tranquility nestled in the heart of bustling Seattle. Sunlight filtered through the stained-glass panel above his mahogany desk, casting rainbows across the Persian rug. Bookshelves lined the walls, overflowing with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and even a few well-worn novels. A framed print of Monet’s Water Lilies hung above the fireplace, its calming colours a stark contrast to the turmoil brewing in the room.

Elias knew Amelia was struggling, her grief palpable. He had seen it before – the raw edges of loss, the crushing weight of despair. He was determined to help her navigate this darkness, to find even the faintest flicker of hope amidst the storm.

"Amelia," he began gently, his voice a soothing balm in the tense silence. "Why don't you start by telling me what brought you here today?"
