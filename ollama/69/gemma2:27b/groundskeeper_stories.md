The dawn mist clung to Elmwood Manor like a spectral shroud, obscuring the ornate facade and twisting the ancient oaks into gnarled, grasping phantoms.  A symphony of birdsong, hesitant at first, rose from the depths of the sprawling gardens, gradually crescendoing into a joyous chorus.

Elias Thornwood, head groundskeeper for nearly three decades, breathed in the cool, damp air, his weathered face creasing into a familiar smile. He knew every inch of these grounds, from the moss-covered sundial to the hidden grotto where shy violets bloomed in spring. Today, however, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, an unsettling stillness amongst the normally chattering squirrels. 

He gripped his pruning shears tighter, their familiar weight comforting in the growing unease. As he approached the rose garden, a flash of crimson caught his eye â€“ a single, withered rose, lying abandoned on the path, its petals stained an unnatural shade of black. Elias frowned.  Roses didn't wither like that. They faded gracefully, surrendering to time with quiet dignity. This was something else entirely.
