The scent of ozone and fried resistors hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elias Finch, chief radio technician for the isolated research outpost perched precariously on the edge of the Great Glacier. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping snow into blinding swirls against the corrugated metal walls of the comms shack. Inside, the rhythmic hum of generators and the steady crackle of static from the long-range transmitter were Elias's only companions.

He hunched over his workbench, soldering delicate wires onto a circuit board the size of a dinner plate.  The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows on his face, highlighting the lines etched around his eyes from years spent staring into oscilloscopes and wrestling with temperamental vacuum tubes. Elias was a man of routine, a creature of habit in this icy wasteland where days bled into weeks and the only measure of time was the changing frequency of the auroras dancing across the night sky.
