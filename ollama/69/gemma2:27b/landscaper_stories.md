The sun beat down on Elias Bartholomew Finnigan's neck as he wrestled with a recalcitrant bougainvillea vine. Its thorns, vicious and unforgiving, snagged at his worn work gloves, drawing beads of sweat from his brow. The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and freshly cut grass, a symphony only a landscaper could truly appreciate. 

Elias surveyed the sprawling estate before him: rolling emerald lawns bordered by fragrant rose bushes, a manicured orchard bursting with ripe oranges and lemons, and a central fountain that tinkled serenely amidst a bed of vibrant petunias. This wasn't just any job; this was Mrs. Cavendish's pride and joy, her botanical oasis tucked away in the heart of Napa Valley. 


Elias loved working here. The meticulously crafted gardens offered a sanctuary from the chaos of the world, a place where time seemed to slow down and nature reigned supreme. But today, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, an almost imperceptible hum that vibrated beneath his calloused fingers as he pruned. It was like a secret whispered on the wind, beckoning him towards something unknown.
