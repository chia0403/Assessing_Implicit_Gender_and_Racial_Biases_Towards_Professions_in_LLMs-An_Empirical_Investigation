The scent of jasmine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of salt from the Mediterranean just beyond the wrought-iron gates.  Eleanor Cartwright adjusted her crisp white gloves, her gaze sweeping over the opulence of the Grand Hotel Miramare's lobby. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating polished marble floors and glittering chandeliers that cast intricate shadows on the plush velvet armchairs.

She was a woman of quiet efficiency and grace, her auburn hair neatly pinned beneath her starched cap, her hazel eyes sharp with attentiveness. For twenty years, Eleanor Cartwright had been the concierge of this iconic establishment, tending to the whims and fancies of its discerning guests. From securing last-minute tickets to La Scala to procuring a rare vintage of Tuscan wine, she navigated their requests with an uncanny blend of discretion and resourcefulness.

But today, something felt different. A ripple of unease hummed beneath Eleanor's composure as she noticed a new arrival â€“ a man shrouded in shadows, his face obscured by the brim of a fedora. He stood apart from the other guests, his presence strangely unsettling amidst the usual symphony of clinking champagne glasses and languid conversation.

As he approached her mahogany desk, Eleanor straightened her posture, her intuition telling her this encounter wouldn't be like any other.
