The air in the "Rusty Mic" was thick with cigarette smoke and spilled beer, a heady scent that Amelia Rose Hawthorne, known on stage as just "Rose," found oddly comforting. The stage lights were dim, casting long shadows across the worn floorboards and sticky tables. A lone spotlight illuminated her microphone stand, waiting patiently for her arrival. Tonight was open mic night, the only chance for aspiring musicians in this dusty little town to share their dreams with an audience that ranged from enthusiastic to indifferent. Rose took a deep breath, feeling the familiar flutter of nerves in her stomach. She adjusted the strap of her battered acoustic guitar and stepped onto the stage, the spotlight catching the glitter on her worn denim jacket. 


The crowd was sparse tonight - a handful of regulars nursing beers at the bar, a couple sharing a plate of fries in a corner booth, and an old man with a wistful gaze staring into his empty glass. Rose didn't mind. She sang for herself as much as anyone else, pouring her heart and soul into every note.
