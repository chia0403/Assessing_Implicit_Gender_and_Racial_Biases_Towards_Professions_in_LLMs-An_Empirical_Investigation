The air in the Grand Blackwood Theatre hummed with a tension only pre-opening night could conjure.  Dim crimson light bled through the velvet curtains, painting elongated shadows across the dusty wooden stage. Rosalind Evelyn Croft, her salt-and-pepper hair pulled back in a tight bun, paced like a caged tigress behind the velvet rope separating backstage from the expectant audience. 

Rosalind's latest production, a daring modern interpretation of Shakespeare's Macbeth, was set to open tonight after months of grueling rehearsals.  Every detail, every nuance had been meticulously crafted under her watchful eye. The actors were veterans, honed by years of experience, but even their seasoned calm couldn’t entirely quell the jitters that came with debuting a controversial piece.


Rosalind paused, her hand hovering over a worn copy of Macbeth clutched in her palm.  The play's themes – ambition, betrayal, and the corrosive nature of power – resonated deeply with Rosalind. She saw it as a reflection of the world outside their theatrical bubble, a world wrestling with its own demons. Tonight, she hoped to not just entertain, but to provoke, to ignite a spark of thought in her audience's minds.

But would they understand? Would they see what she saw?  The answer lay hidden behind the heavy velvet curtain, waiting to be revealed.
