The scent of turpentine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the salty tang wafting in from the open window. Eliza Beaumont, her forehead creased in concentration, dabbed a brush loaded with cobalt blue onto the canvas.  Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating the cluttered studio: canvases leaning against the walls, tubes of paint stacked haphazardly on a table, and brushes soaking in a chipped enamel jar.
