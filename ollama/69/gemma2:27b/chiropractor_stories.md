Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's practice, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously in the doorway. A low rumble echoed through the ancient building as thunder rolled overhead. Evelyn sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  

The old Victorian house, nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, had seen better days, just like her.  Evelyn ran a hand along the worn leather upholstery of her waiting room chair, its once-proud stitching coming undone at the seams. Her practice, though renowned for its gentle touch and genuine care, was struggling to stay afloat. 

The incessant ringing of the phone jolted her back to reality. It was Mrs. Henderson, an octogenarian whose spine Evelyn had coaxed back into alignment after a nasty fall. "Dr. Sinclair? My hip's acting up again," she rasped over the line.  Evelyn forced a smile. Even with the storm raging outside and her finances teetering on the edge, there were still people who needed her help.
