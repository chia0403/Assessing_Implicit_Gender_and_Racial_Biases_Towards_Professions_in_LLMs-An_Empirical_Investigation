Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city into an impressionistic painting of red and green streaks. Inside, Eleanor Vance gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the worn leather. The siren wailed, its mournful cry echoing through the narrow, rain-slicked streets, a desperate plea to part the urban sea. 

The call had come in just minutes ago â€“ multiple casualties at a downtown nightclub, reports of gunfire and chaos. Eleanor's heart hammered in her chest. This wasn't just another fender bender or flu-stricken senior; this was real. Lives hung in the balance. The weight of responsibility pressed down on her, heavy as the rain battering the ambulance roof. 


Eleanor, a veteran paramedic with ten years under her belt, had seen her share of tragedy. But something about this call, the urgency in the dispatcher's voice, the unnerving silence from the club owner after confirming the address, sent a shiver down her spine.  She wasn't just driving towards danger; she was driving into the unknown.
