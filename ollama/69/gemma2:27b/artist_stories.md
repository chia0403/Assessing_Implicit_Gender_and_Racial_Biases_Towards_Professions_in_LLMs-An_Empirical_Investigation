The acrid smell of turpentine stung Eliza Thorne's nostrils as she stared at the canvas before her. Sunlight streamed through the grimy window of her cramped studio apartment, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny, forgotten dreams.  Eliza swirled a brush laden with cadmium yellow, frustration tightening its grip on her chest. The cityscape sprawled before her - a chaotic jumble of buildings and flickering neon signs – yet it refused to translate onto the canvas. It felt lifeless, a pale imitation of the vibrant energy that pulsed through the streets below.

Her studio, tucked above a dusty antique shop, overlooked an alleyway perpetually shrouded in shadow.  It wasn't much, but it was hers – a haven from the relentless clamour of the city and a space to wrestle with her demons through the language of paint.
