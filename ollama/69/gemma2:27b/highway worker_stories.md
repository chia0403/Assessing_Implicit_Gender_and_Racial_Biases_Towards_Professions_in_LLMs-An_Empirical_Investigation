The asphalt shimmered in the midday sun, waves of heat rolling off it like an invisible tide.  Elias "Eli" Blackwood squinted through the glare, sweat stinging his eyes as he wielded the jackhammer, its rhythmic thudding echoing across the deserted stretch of Highway 17. The endless horizon blurred with the haze rising from the parched Nevada landscape, a panorama of scrub brush and dusty mountains punctuated by the occasional skeletal Joshua tree.  Eli's work boots kicked up plumes of red dust with every step, coating his already grime-stained overalls in another layer of desert patina.

Today, like most days, was a symphony of solitude - broken only by the harsh drone of machinery and the occasional buzzard circling overhead. He preferred it that way. Out here, surrounded by nothing but endless sky and baking earth, Eli could let his mind wander.  He'd think about his daughter, Lily, back in Reno, her bright laughter echoing through the dusty silence of his thoughts.  Heâ€™d picture her face, freckled and framed by a mop of unruly brown curls, a smile that always managed to melt the toughest exterior.

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Eli's spine as he paused his work, scanning the desolate landscape. The silence seemed heavier than usual, the air thick with an unspoken tension. He couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone.
