Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Cartwright's tiny office, mimicking the relentless ache throbbing in her own knee. The ancient building groaned under the assault, its timbers protesting like an arthritic old man. Amelia winced in sympathy, then sighed and pushed away the stack of patient charts cluttering her desk.

It was a Tuesday, one of those perpetually dreary Tuesdays that seemed to bleed into every other day in this damp corner of coastal Maine. The salty air carried the scent of seaweed and decay, a fitting aroma for her current mood.  She'd poured her heart and soul into setting up this practice, "Cartwright Physiotherapy," hoping to bring much-needed care to the isolated fishing community. But so far, business had been as slow as a lobster boat in a fog.

Just then, a timid knock echoed through the room, startling Amelia from her musings. A shiver of hope ran down her spine. Could this be it? Her first patient? She straightened her cardigan and pasted on her brightest smile, hoping to banish the shadows that had settled over her little office.
