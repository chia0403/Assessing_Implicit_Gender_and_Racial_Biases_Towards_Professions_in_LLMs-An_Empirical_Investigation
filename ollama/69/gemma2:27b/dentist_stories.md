The rusty whirring of the ancient drill pierced through Elizabeth "Beth" Hawthorne's concentration like a rogue molar. She sighed, pushing a stray curl away from her forehead as she peered at the X-ray illuminating the cavernous cavity on Mr. Peterson's lower right incisor. It was bad. Really bad.  

Her dental practice, nestled in a rambling Victorian house on Elm Street, had seen better days. The peeling paint and creaky floorboards seemed to reflect her own weariness. Beth hadn't meant for it to be this way. Fresh out of dental school, she'd dreamt of gleaming stainless steel, state-of-the-art equipment, and a steady stream of grateful patients. Instead, Elm Street had become her reality - a quiet corner of the world where time seemed to stand still.

Still, Beth loved her patients. Mr. Peterson, with his twinkling blue eyes and penchant for bad puns, was a favorite. He'd been coming to her since she'd inherited the practice from her grandfather ten years ago. But this cavity...it threatened to push even her patience to its limit.
