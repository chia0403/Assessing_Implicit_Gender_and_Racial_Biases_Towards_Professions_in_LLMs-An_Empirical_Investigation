The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting sickly green shadows across Penelope "Penny" Blackwood's trench coat. Rain, relentless and icy, lashed against the grimy windowpane of her office overlooking the alleyway. Penny, with a cigarette perpetually dangling from her lips, tapped ash into a chipped porcelain ashtray overflowing with butts. Her office – a cramped space smelling faintly of stale coffee and desperation – reflected its occupant: a woman hardened by years navigating the city's underbelly. 

The door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a figure silhouetted against the streetlights. Penny squinted through the smoke.  "You're late," she rasped, her voice gravelly from too much whiskey and too little sleep. "And you didn't bring me the usual."
