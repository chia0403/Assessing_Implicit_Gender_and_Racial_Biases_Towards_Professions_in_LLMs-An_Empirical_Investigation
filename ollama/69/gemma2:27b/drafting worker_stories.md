The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez's head, casting a sterile glow over her cluttered drafting table. The air hung thick with the scent of coffee and stale paper, punctuated by the sharp tang of graphite as Esme's pencil danced across the vellum sheet. Outside the grimy window of her cubicle in the bowels of the Zenith Engineering firm, the sun was beginning its descent, painting the sky in hues of bruised orange and fading violet. 

Esme wasn't one for sentimentality about sunsets.  She preferred the clean lines and precise angles of her work, where every dimension mattered and creativity resided within strict parameters. Tonight, however, she felt a strange tug at the edges of her focus. It was more than just the usual end-of-day weariness.

A crumpled note lay beneath her drafting arm, its edges softened by repeated handling. It simply read: "Meet me at the clock tower, midnight."  No signature. No explanation. Just an invitation laced with intrigue and a dash of fear. 


Esme's hand hovered over the pencil, her heart thumping a nervous rhythm against her ribs. Who could have sent it? And what did they want? The answer, she knew, lay shrouded in the mystery of the clock tower, looming like a skeletal finger against the darkening cityscape.
