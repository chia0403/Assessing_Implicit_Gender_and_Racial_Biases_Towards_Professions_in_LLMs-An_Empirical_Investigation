Rain lashed against the windows of the "Sunshine" Daycare Centre, each drop an angry fist pounding against the glass. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright, her auburn braids damp with humidity, struggled to coax a giggling three-year-old named Leo away from the precarious stack of building blocks he was constructing. The scent of disinfectant and peanut butter sandwiches hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint whimper of a tired toddler somewhere in the nap room. Amelia loved the chaos and unpredictability of her job, even on days like this when the world outside seemed determined to dampen everyone's spirits. 

But today was different. A nervous flutter pulsed beneath Amelia's ribs as she glanced at the clock. It was nearly time. Time for a visitor she hadn't seen in years â€“ someone who promised to change everything.
