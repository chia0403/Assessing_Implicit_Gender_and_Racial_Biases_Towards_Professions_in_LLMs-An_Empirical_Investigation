Rain hammered against Elias "Eli" Blackwood's worn canvas jacket, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of icy water. The wind, a spiteful demon, whipped through the gaps in his threadbare beanie, trying to snatch away his already precarious footing on the steeply sloped roof. He clung tighter to the rusty ladder rung, cursing the fickle spring weather that had promised sunshine but delivered this relentless deluge instead. 

Below him, nestled amongst the bustling Victorian terraces of Ashton Hill, lay Mrs. Hawthorne's prized rose garden, now drowning in a sea of muddy brown water. Eli grimaced. This wasn't exactly what he envisioned when he started his own roofing business after leaving the army. He dreamt of sun-drenched days spent meticulously laying tiles, not battling wind and rain like some kind of medieval gargoyle.

Still, he had a job to do. Mrs. Hawthorne was insistent on having her roof repaired before the next storm hit â€“ something Eli understood all too well given his recent experience with leaky roofs in his own rented flat. He took a deep breath, summoning his inner sergeant and steeled himself for another battle against the elements.
