The mahogany gavel felt cold and heavy in Judge Eleanor Winthrop's hand. She traced the intricate carving of a phoenix rising from flames with her thumb, a habit she developed during particularly grueling trials. Outside, the late summer sun beat down on the sandstone courthouse, casting long shadows across the manicured lawn.

Eleanor glanced at the faces before her: the young woman accused of arson, her eyes red-rimmed and haunted; the elderly shopkeeper whose livelihood had been reduced to ashes, his gaze fixed on the defendant with a simmering rage. The weight of their stories, their hopes and fears, pressed down on Eleanor's shoulders. Today's verdict would irrevocably change their lives.
