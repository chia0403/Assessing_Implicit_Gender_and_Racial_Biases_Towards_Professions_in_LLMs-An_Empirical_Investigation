The morning mist clung stubbornly to the ancient oaks lining the dirt road leading to Willow Creek Wildlife Sanctuary. Emilia Rose Hawthorne tugged her worn corduroy jacket tighter around herself as she trudged towards the ramshackle barn, its wooden sides weathered grey with age. The sanctuary was tucked away in a forgotten corner of Vermont, far from the hustle and bustle of city life. It was a haven for injured and orphaned animals, a place where Emilia poured all her love and dedication into mending broken wings, soothing aching limbs, and nurturing fragile lives back to health. Today promised to be another busy one: a fledgling owl with a fractured wing awaited rehabilitation, a mischievous fox cub needed its wound cleaned, and the resident deer herd were due for their morning feeding. 

Emilia inhaled deeply, the crisp air tinged with the earthy scent of damp leaves and pine needles. A sense of quiet purpose settled over her as she pushed open the creaky barn door, ready to face whatever challenges the day might bring.
