The air hung heavy with pine needles and damp earth, clinging to Elias Blackwood's beard like cobwebs as he swung the axe high above his head. Sunlight dappled through the towering firs, painting shifting patterns on the forest floor. Elias grunted with effort as the blade bit into the ancient redwood, sending a shower of wood chips flying.

He was a man sculpted by the woods – broad-shouldered and tanned, with calloused hands that could coax life from a dying sapling or fell a giant in a single blow. He'd spent his entire 38 years beneath this canopy, learning the whispers of the wind through the leaves, the secrets hidden in the rings of ancient trees. But today, something felt different. A disquiet hummed beneath the familiar rhythm of his work, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck that warned of unseen eyes.

Elias paused, wiping the sweat from his brow and scanning the silent forest around him. Nothing stirred but the occasional flitting bird or the rustling of leaves in the breeze. Still, the unease lingered, twisting like a knot in his gut. He knew these woods intimately, every mossy knoll and hidden stream. This feeling – it wasn't natural.
