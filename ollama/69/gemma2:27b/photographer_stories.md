Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thorne's cramped studio apartment, each droplet a tiny hammer blow against his already fractured concentration. The late afternoon light was fading fast, casting long, melancholy shadows across the cluttered space. Cameras, lenses, and tripods lay scattered like fallen warriors on a battlefield of creativity. A half-eaten sandwich sat neglected on a table piled high with developing trays and crumpled printouts. 

Elias, his unruly dark hair plastered to his forehead, sighed deeply and lowered his camera.  Heâ€™d been chasing the perfect shot of the dilapidated factory across the street for weeks now, but the relentless drizzle was proving to be an insurmountable foe. The rusted metal beams and peeling paint seemed to melt into a monochrome blur under the grey sky, losing their haunting beauty. Elias ran a frustrated hand through his hair.  

He needed this shot. He needed it to breathe life back into his stagnant career, to prove to himself that he hadn't lost his touch.
