Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Victorian townhouse, mimicking the frantic beat of Eloise Beaumont's heart. She stood in the cavernous entryway, her designer heels clicking on the marble floor like metronomes keeping time with her anxiety.  

The house, a grand dame slumbering beneath layers of dust and neglect, was Eloise's latest project – a challenge she hadn’t anticipated. It wasn't just the crumbling plasterwork or the musty smell clinging to every corner that unnerved her. No, it was the history whispering from the shadows, a tangled tapestry woven with whispers of faded glory and unspoken secrets.

Eloise clutched her worn leather portfolio, its contents holding the key to breathing new life into this forgotten beauty. But as she gazed up at the ornate chandelier dangling precariously from its rusted chain, she couldn't help but feel a shiver crawl down her spine.  Something about the house felt…off. Like it was watching her, waiting.
