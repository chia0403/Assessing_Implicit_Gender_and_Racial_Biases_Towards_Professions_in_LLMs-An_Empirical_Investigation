Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elara Finch's clinic, blurring the already indistinct neon signs that lined the street below. The air hung heavy with the smell of disinfectant and fear - a potent cocktail familiar to anyone who worked in this part of the city. 

Elara sighed, running a hand through her tangled auburn hair. Her reflection in the stainless steel examination table was weary: dark circles ringed her blue eyes, her once crisp white coat was stained with something unidentified (and hopefully not contagious), and a tremor ran through her hands as she reached for the steaming mug of tea left on her desk by Mrs. Ramirez, the kindly old woman who lived upstairs.

The bell above the door jangled, momentarily cutting through the drumming rain. Elara straightened, forcing a smile onto her face. It was late, almost closing time, but in this neighborhood, you never knew who might stumble through your door needing help.
