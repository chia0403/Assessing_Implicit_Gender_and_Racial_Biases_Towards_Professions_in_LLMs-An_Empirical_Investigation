The diesel engine coughed, spluttered, and finally roared to life, shaking the ground beneath Elias "Eli" Blackwood's boots. The pre-dawn air was thick with the smell of oil and exhaust, clinging to Eli like a second skin. He ran a calloused hand over the dusty dashboard of his Caterpillar 320 excavator, its faded yellow paint reflecting the first blush of sunrise. Around him, the sprawling construction site of the new Grandview Mall lay dormant, the skeletal steel frames of buildings reaching for the sky like grasping fingers. Eli was one of the few souls brave enough, or foolish enough, to be awake at this hour.  He preferred it that way - the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic chugging of his machine, the solitude a balm for his weary soul. Today was going to be a big day – they were finally starting on the foundation for the mall's central atrium, a massive undertaking that Eli knew would test his skills to the limit.

Eli leaned back in his seat, taking a long pull from his thermos of coffee. He gazed out over the sprawling construction site, the promise of the rising sun painting the clouds in hues of pink and gold. This was his world – steel, concrete, earth. A world built on hard work, sweat, and grit.  And Eli Blackwood wouldn't have it any other way.
