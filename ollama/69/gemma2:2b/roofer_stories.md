## Setting the Stage: 

**Location:**  Dustbowl City, Arizona - A once-bustling metropolis now reduced to a dusty ghost town, with towering tumbleweeds rolling across cracked pavement like forgotten dreams. The harsh, unforgiving desert sun beats down relentlessly on the skeletal remains of structures that haven't seen paint or laughter in decades.  

**Time:** Midday during the summer. 

**Character:**  Clayton "Clay" Montgomery - A young roofer, weathered and strong but with a youthful spark flickering behind his tired blue eyes. He's known for his meticulous work ethic, quiet demeanor, and an uncanny ability to find a sunbeam even on the cloudiest of days.


**Opening Lines:** 

The air hung thick and heavy, a shimmering haze clinging to Clay's weathered face as he surveyed the crumbling skyline of Dustbowl City from atop the scaffold. His trusty red workboots crunched on the gravel path below – a sound that used to be a symphony of life before the dust storms swallowed everything whole.  Today, it was just another echo in the empty silence of this forgotten city.  Clay's gaze drifted towards the horizon, where the sun bled through the clouds like a rusty wrench, casting long, distorted shadows across the desolate landscape. 

This wasn’t his first rodeo with Dustbowl City. He had spent years battling the elements and the relentless march of time here.  He knew its secrets – the hidden wells that ran dry years ago, the abandoned schoolhouses haunted by ghost stories, and the whispers of a buried past yearning to be unearthed. And Clay was determined to uncover some of those secrets.
