The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sprawling halls of Northgate High School as Amelia Rivers, a seasoned guidance counselor with silver streaks in her hair and eyes that held the wisdom of a thousand conversations, surveyed the scene. Her office, tucked away near the library entrance, was typically overflowing with teenage chaos. But today, it seemed eerily quiet. 

The usual symphony of fidgeting feet, muffled whispered anxieties, and the occasional frustrated sigh had been replaced by an unsettling stillness. The air hummed with a kind of unspoken tension Amelia couldn't quite place. She ran a hand through her hair, feeling a familiar knot of unease tighten in her chest. This wasn't just another Wednesday; this felt different. 

Amelia sighed and picked up a worn copy of "The Odyssey" from the overflowing bookshelf beside her desk. A storm of unspoken anxieties brewed, threatening to break the fragile peace within the room.  She had a feeling this wouldn't be an ordinary day, not in the least. As she settled into her chair, a gentle knock on the door made her eyes widen. A figure stood there, shrouded in darkness.
