## Setting: 

The sterile white walls of "Bright Smiles Dental" hummed with quiet anticipation. The usual morning rush was just beginning to settle - the receptionist's cheery voice floated over the low-frequency chatter of drills and vacuum cleaners, while the scent of antiseptic mingled with freshly brewed coffee. Outside the windows, a misty dawn painted the city skyline in shades of grey and rose. 

## Character: 

Evelyn Rose Hawthorne, known as Ellie by her patients and friends alike, adjusted the collar of her pristine uniform, taking a deep breath of the calm before the storm. For years, she had found solace in the meticulous routines of dental hygiene - the gentle scraping of plaque, the precise placement of fillings, the reassuring touch of a patient's hand. 

Ellie’s life had been an intricate dance between order and chaos, a melody played on the strings of her responsibility as a dental hygienist. Each day brought its own symphony of challenges: from delicate procedures to grumpy patients, from last-minute emergencies to the comforting familiarity of routine.  


Today was no different. But something felt off, like the notes in a song had shifted slightly, throwing her out of balance. As she started her rounds, Ellie's keen eyes caught a flicker of movement from Mrs. Henderson's chair across the room. It wasn’t just a restless hand clutching a teacup – it was someone else's shadow dancing in the corner of her vision, something both familiar and unsettlingly foreign.
