##  Story Opening:

The fluorescent lights hummed like cicadas in a heatwave, casting a sterile glow on the faces of Mrs. Eleanor Hayes' 10th-grade English students. She had been standing there for the past thirty minutes, patiently watching them struggle with the delicate art of writing poetry about grief, her own heart echoing the mournful notes of their stifled sobs. The air in the classroom felt thick, heavy with unuttered emotions and unspoken memories. Outside, a violent storm raged, mirroring the tempest within each student's soul.

**Character:** Mrs. Eleanor Hayes (Ellie) -  A 30-something year old English teacher at Northgate High School. She has long, auburn hair she keeps tied back in a messy bun, and her eyes seem to hold both weariness and an unwavering passion for the written word.  She believes every student holds a unique story within them and strives to help them find their voice.

**Setting:** 
Northgate High School: A sprawling, traditional high school located on a sleepy suburban street with boarded-up windows and peeling paint. The hallways are dark and dusty, reflecting a lack of interest in the younger generations' future ambitions. The library is a dimly lit haven for the intellectually curious, but it holds a lingering sadness, like the memories buried under stacks of old books.
