The desert air hung heavy, thick with the scent of dust and diesel fumes.  A stubborn red haze stretched across the horizon, the sun a searing eye in the sky. The only sound besides the steady hum of his engine was the mournful whistle of an unseen coyote high above. Hank “Hawkeye” Hawkins squinted out from behind the wheel of his rig, 'Red Rocket,' its name as iconic and worn as his trucker hat. He hadn't seen another soul for miles, the endless expanse of desert stretching on like a wrinkled tapestry in the distance. 

Hank was running late.  He’d promised Mrs. Peterson at the diner back home a ‘big-rig special,’ her favorite pecan pie, even if it meant pushing through the night. She'd been down on her luck lately and Hank couldn't let her face another day without a little sweet solace.  The thought spurred him on, his eyes glued to the road ahead, each mile marker like a beacon of hope in this desolate landscape.
