## Setting:  

The sprawling estate known as Whisperwood Manor belonged to the Blackwood family for generations. Now, it stood silhouetted against the stormy sky, its stone walls weathered gray and overgrown with ivy that clambered like forgotten memories. Moonlight dripped in through dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing on cracked porcelain dolls in a nursery room. A wind, sharp as glass shards, howled through the skeletal trees bordering the property, their branches creaking with an ancient groan. 

## Story Opening: 


A lone figure, silhouetted against the dying light of the setting sun, bent over his work at the edge of the manor's overgrown garden. Elias Blackwood, groundskeeper since he was a boy, knew this place like the lines on his hand. Every blade of grass, every creak in the ancient oak trees held stories whispered through the ages, and he sought to understand them. 

His hands, strong from years spent wrestling with the stubborn earth and thorns, moved with practiced ease, smoothing over the freshly tilled soil that had been a battlefield of weeds just days before. He looked up as a chilling wind whipped around him, carrying with it the faint scent of rain and something more – an unsettling note of decay.  It was the same stench that lingered after their last visitor departed - a woman whose name he would only ever remember as "The Lady," her presence a haunting echo in his memory, shrouded even further by the secrets she carried within herself.  

"Just another storm," he muttered to himself, more to reassure his own weary soul than to address the howling wind. But a knot of unease tightened in his chest. He wouldn’t be surprised if this wasn't just any storm. This was Whisperwood's own kind of unsettling melody - the song of secrets waiting to unravel.
