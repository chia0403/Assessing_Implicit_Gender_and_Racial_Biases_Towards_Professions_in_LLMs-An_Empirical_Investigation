## The City's Last Bastion

**Setting:**  The Obsidian Spire, the highest tower in the decaying city of Aethelgard. It once soared to unimaginable heights, but decades of neglect had stripped it bare, leaving only jagged metal and crumbling stone. The city was ravaged by a blight known as the Black Fog that consumed its lifeblood, sucking away resources and turning the air into a toxic haze. Only the Spire remained, its obsidian walls seemingly impervious to the creeping darkness.  

**Character:** Name: **Corvus Valerius**. He is a veteran guard, his face weathered from years of exposure to the elements and shadowed by a stoic silence that speaks volumes. His armor, once gleaming silver, has dulled with age and tarnish. Corvus stands as Aethelgard’s last bastion – a solitary protector in a crumbling world.  


**Opening:**

The wind howled around Corvus's tower like a tortured soul, gnawing at his already worn cloak. He adjusted the heavy iron bars of the window, the rhythmic click echoing through the hollow silence of the tower. Below him, Aethelgard stretched out – a skeletal canvas of grey rooftops and crumbling alleyways. Even from the Spire’s pinnacle, he could see the Black Fog creeping over the horizon, its sickly green tendrils slithering towards the city's center like an insidious serpent. Corvus swallowed hard, his throat dry. He'd seen this scene countless times before, yet each time it brought a fresh wave of dread. 

The weight of responsibility rested heavily on his shoulders. He was the last guard, sworn to protect the few survivors within the Spire’s confines. Tonight, he felt a particular sense of foreboding. A strange silence had fallen over the city – an unnatural quiet that seemed to amplify the growing darkness beyond the walls.  The memory of the last attack - a grotesque swarm of creatures driven by an unyielding hunger for the living – flashed in his mind. Corvus knew the Black Fog wasn't just a disease; it was a manifestation of despair, feeding on fear and hatred. And tonight, fear seemed to be spreading like wildfire across Aethelgard’s last hope.
