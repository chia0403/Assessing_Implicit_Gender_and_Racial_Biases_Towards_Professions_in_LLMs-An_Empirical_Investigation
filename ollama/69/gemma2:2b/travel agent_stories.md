The stale air of Amelia "Amy" Croft's office hung thick with anticipation. Outside, the late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of her modest storefront on Mulberry Street, casting long shadows across the cluttered desk and overflowing filing cabinets. Amy idly swiped at a stray speck of dust on her well-worn travel guide to Bali, her thoughts elsewhere, adrift like seagulls in a tempestuous sky.  

The phone rang, shattering the quiet hum of her inner monologue. 

"Amy Croft Travel," she answered with a weary sigh. "What brings you on this fine evening?" Her tone was anything but cheerful; the usual bubbly energy that filled the office seemed to have vanished, leaving only the weight of countless unanswered travel dreams and a growing pile of paperwork threatening to engulf her.  
 
"Well, I'll be," a voice croaked from the other end, tinged with what Amy could only describe as "dismay." It was Harold, a regular client, a man known for his over-the-top travel itineraries - and his even more over-the-top complaints about last minute flight cancellations. He was always the embodiment of chaos in Amy's carefully organized life, and tonight was no exception. 
 
"What is it this time, Harold?" Amy asked, her voice already laced with the familiar mix of resignation and annoyance that seemed to follow him like a shadow.
