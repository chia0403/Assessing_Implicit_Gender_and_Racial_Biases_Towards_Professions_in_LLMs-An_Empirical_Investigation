The morning air clung to Dr. Elias Thorne like an unwelcome patient, carrying the weight of pre-dawn smog. He pulled his worn leather jacket tighter around him as he surveyed his practice - "Thorne's Tidings" - perched in the quiet heart of a Victorian street bustling with the early bird routines.  His tiny office windows looked out onto a cobbled courtyard, where pigeons cooed and stray cats debated ownership of sunbeams.

Elias himself was a picture of calm – almost too calm for the life he led. His white coat, pristine like a snowdrift, hung loosely on his lean frame as he adjusted the thick glasses perched precariously upon his nose.  His reflection in the stainless steel tray of a patient's teeth looked back at him with an air of weary resignation - a man who had mastered the art of wielding delicate instruments and soothing anxious chatter, yet couldn’t quite tame the gnawing fear that echoed in the silence between appointments. The only sound louder than the ticking clock was the steady beat of his pulse as he waited for another day to begin – another patient's anxieties to quell, another smile to be revealed.
