## Setting:

The year is 1936. The Great Depression has gripped the United States like a vise, its teeth gnashing at the hopes and dreams of countless families. Dust storms have become commonplace in Kansas, swirling around dilapidated houses and factories like ghosts of a forgotten past. A lone street lamp casts elongated shadows across the cracked asphalt, illuminating the rusting skeleton of a once-grand diner called 'The Golden Spoon'.  

## Character: 

Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Grant, a sharp-witted young physician with eyes that hold both the sorrow of seeing too much and the fierce determination to heal, stands on the sidewalk, gazing at the skeletal remains of The Golden Spoon.  She had always wanted to work in this community, believing her role was not simply in mending bodies but also in mending souls. Yet, after five years in this town plagued by despair and uncertainty, even the most resilient spirit felt chipped away. 

Evie’s worn stethoscope feels heavy against her chest. It is a relic from another era, yet it represents a promise of hope amidst the relentless bleakness. She'd hoped to be a beacon of light for these struggling souls but lately, she feels more like a lighthouse keeper on a rocky coast, battling loneliness and exhaustion. 


**The opening sentence:**

*“Some days,” Evie thought, “even the wind seems to carry the weight of despair.”*
