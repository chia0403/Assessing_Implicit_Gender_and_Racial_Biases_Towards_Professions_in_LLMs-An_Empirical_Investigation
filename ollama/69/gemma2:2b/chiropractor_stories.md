## The Crackle in the Silence 

Rain hammered against the roof of Dr. Elias Thorne’s clinic, mimicking the frantic drumming of Amelia's heart as she sat on the treatment table.  The air inside was thick with the scent of cedarwood essential oils and something else: a faint metallic tang that Elias had come to associate with nervous tension. 

Elias Thorne adjusted his tie, his face obscured by the dim light of the overhead lamp. His eyes were the colour of warm honey, crinkling at the corners as he surveyed Amelia's trembling form. This wasn’t just another patient; not after all these years in practice. Elias had always felt a peculiar pull towards those who carried their burdens – both physical and emotional – like silent waterfalls threatening to overflow. 

The wind howled outside, and Amelia shifted uncomfortably under the thin sheet of linen. "Tell me what's happening," Elias said, his voice gentle yet firm. "I need you to speak."

As he began working, a delicate symphony of clicks, pops, and groans filled the room, a familiar melody that often served as both comfort and an unwelcome reminder of her own suppressed pain. 


**Setting:**  A quiet, independent clinic nestled on a side street in a city known for its old-world charm and hidden pockets of resilience. The atmosphere was a mixture of vintage antique furniture, calming blues and greens painted across the walls, and a tangible sense of community that permeated every creak and groan.
