Rain lashed against the windows of Arthur Sterling's office, blurring the streetlights into hazy streaks of yellow and orange.  A mug slipped from his numb fingers as he stared at the ledger, its once-familiar numbers now swirling like smoke in the storm’s fury.  He hadn't expected this kind of a night to be more depressing than a Tuesday afternoon tax audit. 

Arthur Sterling, BA in Accounting with a side passion for historical mystery novels and an undeniable aversion to anything remotely resembling sunshine, was a man born out of order. His life followed no set pattern, nor did his mind, which often meandered between the minutiae of spreadsheets and existential questions about the inherent absurdity of paying taxes at all.  He’d rather unravel a cryptic code in Edgar Allan Poe's work than deal with another client meeting, especially one involving a high-stakes merger that was threatening to engulf him in a sea of red ink and legal jargon.

His gaze fell on a crumpled letter taped to the bulletin board - an invitation from a mysterious society known as The Antiquarians.  It promised untold secrets about the past and whispered promises of hidden treasure. Arthur, always drawn to the allure of a puzzle he couldn’t solve but was desperate to understand, felt his interest ignite like a spark in the storm's dark embrace.

The night stretched on, each minute punctuated by the frantic drumming of rain against the roof and the rhythmic whirring of the office's aging air-con unit. Arthur knew this storm would be here for days, he just hoped it wouldn’t reveal too much about his own life – or about him being completely lost in its depths.
