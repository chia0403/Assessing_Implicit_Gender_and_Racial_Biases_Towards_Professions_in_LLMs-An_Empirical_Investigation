The neon sign outside "Sugar & Spice Salon" buzzed with an erratic hum, its orange glow fighting against the thick fog that clung to Chicago in late October.  Rain pattered rhythmically on the corrugated metal roof of the small storefront, and inside, Amelia 'Amy' Thorne, owner and head cosmetologist, prepped her station for a full-day onslaught of clients. 

The scent of hairspray, shampoo, and peppermint oil hung thick in the air as Amy meticulously preened a clientâ€™s freshly washed blonde mane with a wide-tooth comb. Her hands moved effortlessly, each stroke precise and sure. The whirring of the dryer filled the air, punctuated by hushed conversations between clients and the occasional burst of laughter from Amy's younger niece, Lily, who sat on the corner seat, helping to organize loose hair ties. 

It was a Tuesday, one of those days where the usual bustling routine felt strangely quiet. It wasn't the lack of customers that bothered Amy; it was the unsettling lull before the storm. The kind that settled over her like a thick fog, blurring the lines between reality and anxiety.  The storm was coming, she could feel it in her bones.
