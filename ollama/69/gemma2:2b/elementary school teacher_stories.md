The late autumn air hung heavy with the scent of wet leaves and woodsmoke as Ms. Evelyn Blackwood settled into her third-floor classroom at Oakwood Elementary. A soft, orange glow bled through the windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. The room, usually a whirlwind of laughter and sticky handprints, was eerily quiet.  A thin layer of snow had begun to settle on the ground outside, turning the world into a hushed gray canvas. 

Evelynâ€™s gaze swept over the familiar scene: mismatched chairs grouped around an oversized table, posters of whimsical forest creatures plastered on the walls, and a vintage clock with chipped hands that ticked away like a broken heartbeat in this quiet pre-morning hush. The year was 1978, and her classroom at Oakwood was a haven for Mrs. Miller's rambunctious first graders, whose boundless energy seemed to defy the limitations of time itself.  

Today, however, the usual chaos had been replaced with an unsettling silence. Ms. Blackwood glanced down at the worn-out photo of Mr. Henderson, their beloved former principal, tucked under her desk.  His cheerful smile was a stark reminder of the normalcy that felt so far away.
