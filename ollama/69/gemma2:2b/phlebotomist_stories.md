The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Hayes, casting a sterile, almost blinding glare on the dozens of glass vials lined up on her worktable. Her steely gaze swept across them like a hawk surveying its prey, and she felt an unsettling calmness settle over her. It was 7:15 AM, just another Tuesday morning at Mercy General Hospital. But this day held a certain weight - it was the day she would draw blood from the legendary "Unstable One," an enigmatic patient who had been declared a danger to himself and others since his arrival.  

Amy adjusted her scrubs, feeling the familiar rough texture against her skin. She glanced out of the small window facing the sterile white walls of the lab. Outside, the city was slowly waking up, sunlight creeping through the cracks in the blinds and painting dancing shadows on the floor. The world outside felt alive, vibrant with a chaotic energy that Amy found both soothing and frustratingly disruptive to her work. 

This was her life - drawing blood. A life she had embraced as a young woman desperate for something tangible after years of feeling lost in a sea of uncertainties. But lately, even the familiar routine seemed tainted by an undercurrent of fear, fueled by the patient's whispered rumors and the unsettling intensity radiating off him every time she entered his room.
