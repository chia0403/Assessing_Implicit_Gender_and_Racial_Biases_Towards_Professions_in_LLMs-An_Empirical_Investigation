The late afternoon sun bled through the grimy windowpane, painting thin stripes across the floor of Ethan Thorne's pharmacy. His world was a symphony of muted smells – antiseptic disinfectant, lingering traces of peppermint cough syrup, and the metallic tang of expired vitamins. It was a comforting routine, this daily ritual he’d performed for twenty years, yet today it felt off-kilter, his usual calm replaced by a knot of unease in his gut. 

Ethan Thorne, licensed pharmacist extraordinaire with a penchant for old jazz records and meticulously organised filing cabinets, usually found solace in the familiar rhythm of dispensing medication. But this afternoon, the usual tranquility was challenged by the chaotic scene unfolding outside his shop's front door.  A sea of protesters, their faces contorted in a blend of anger and desperation, surrounded the police officers keeping them at bay. Their placards were a jumbled kaleidoscope of grievances: "Honesty is a Price We All Pay", "They Will Not Silence Us Any Longer", "Medicated for Profit, Not People."  Ethan knew he had to choose - his job or something much larger than himself.
