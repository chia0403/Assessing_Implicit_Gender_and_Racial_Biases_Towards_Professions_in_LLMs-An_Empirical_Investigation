## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** A quaint Victorian house in the English countryside, nestled amongst rolling hills and whispering willow trees.  The house is home to Mrs. Elsie Worthington, a woman known for her kindness and her uncanny knack for understanding children's unspoken emotions.  She’s built a reputation as one of the most beloved caretakers for rambunctious families with little ones like Amelia, whose mischievous grin was as bright as the morning sun. 

**Character:** Amelia Price, age 8, is anything but ordinary. With her wild ginger curls and boundless energy, she's a whirlwind of laughter and curiosity.  Her imagination runs riot, transforming every corner into an extraordinary adventure.  Her days at Mrs. Worthington’s house are filled with fantastical tales told while sipping tea from mismatched china cups, painting elaborate landscapes on dusty canvases with the colours of forgotten dreams. 

**Opening Lines:** “The house whispered secrets,” Amelia decided one afternoon as she sat on the worn velvet chaise lounge.  “It breathed stories into my ears and spun magic between the shadows.” The old Victorian home creaked with every sigh of the wind, its windows like watchful eyes peering at the young girl's imagination. Tonight, however, it felt different; a strange unease settled over Amelia’s small frame as she watched Mrs. Worthington prepare for her evening tea party. "Something is going on," Amelia whispered to herself, a knot forming in her stomach.  The air itself felt thick with an unspoken tension.
