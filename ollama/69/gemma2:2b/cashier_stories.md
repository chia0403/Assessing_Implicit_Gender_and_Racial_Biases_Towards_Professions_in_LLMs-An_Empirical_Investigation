The smell of stale coffee and unfulfilled dreams hung thick in the air, a familiar aroma that Eloise found strangely comforting amidst the cacophony of her morning routine. Her worn blue apron was stained from years of spilled soda and accidental flour explosions, a silent testament to her dedication to serving the early risers of Maple Street.
