The morning mist clung to the fields like a damp shroud, obscuring the usual vibrant hues of sunrise. It was a day for contemplation, not celebration, for young Elijah Croft's heart felt heavier than the stone he carried in his hand. He knelt by the rickety shed, the familiar weight of the worn-out plough handle grounding him to reality as it seemed impossible that this life he’d known all his 18 years was about to change.  

Elijah was a farmer, born and bred on the sprawling Croft's Estate in the heart of Devon. Generations before him had tilled the land under a sky of blue, their livelihood woven with the rhythm of nature’s cycles. The estate itself, named after its founder, stood proudly against the backdrop of rolling hills, a silhouette etched against the rugged coastline. Yet now, a creeping sense of dread gnawed at Elijah's insides like a hungry wolf. 

The stone, heavy and cold in his hands, bore the inscription "Estate: Croft" - an echo of past glory that felt increasingly hollow with each passing day. The manor house was perched upon its own hilltop, a silent witness to the turmoil swirling inside him. Today’s task wasn't clearing the shed for tools; it was clearing the land – and himself – of the burden of legacy.
