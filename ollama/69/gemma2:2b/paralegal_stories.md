The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and despair in the cramped office.  Rain hammered against the windowpanes like a thousand tiny fists, blurring the already dismal cityscape outside into an indistinguishable mass of gray.  Across the desk from Amelia 'Amy' Thorne, her partner, Johnathan "Jonny" Smith, looked more stressed than usual, his usually calm eyes narrowed and flickering with frustration. 

“This is hopeless,” he muttered, tapping a worn-out file cover against the table. “The whole thing just feels…off.” The legal battles they were embroiled in had always been messy, but this case was different. It felt personal.  Amy knew it too.  She looked at her reflection in the metal office filing cabinet; tired eyes staring back, mirroring the storm raging outside.

They were dealing with a wrongful-death lawsuit against a pharmaceutical giant that manufactured a drug with devastating consequences for patients. The weight of it all seemed to be crushing them both. Amy was used to handling the mundane paperwork and legal jargon, but this case felt…bigger. More important. Her hands tightened around a mug as she stared out the window, trying to conjure up some sense of clarity in the chaos swirling around her.
