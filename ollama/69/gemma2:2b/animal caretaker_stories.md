The air hung thick with humidity as Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne adjusted her battered baseball cap.  Even at 6:00 AM in June, the tropical rainforest felt like an oven. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the gentle breeze rustling through the giant fern fronds overhead. Amy was a caretaker at the Fauna Sanctuary, a sprawling estate nestled deep within the Amazonian jungle. Here, amongst the lush foliage and cacophony of wildlife, she cared for rescued animals - a motley crew ranging from majestic macaws with feathers like stained glass to shy sloths hanging motionless in the branches. 

Today's mission was daunting: cleaning the enclosures for the notoriously skittish jaguar, Pantera. The massive beast had an unpredictable temperament and a history of escapes that left her shaken every time. But Amyâ€™s heart beat a little faster than usual, not just from the humidity or the looming presence of Pantera, but because today marked her tenth anniversary at the Fauna Sanctuary - a milestone she couldn't help but feel both excited and slightly terrified about.
