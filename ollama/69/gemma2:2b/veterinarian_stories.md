The biting wind whipped Dr. Elara Thorne's thick coat as she strode across the dusty plains, her boots crunching on the dried earth. The ranch house in the distance loomed like an old, gnarled oak against the bruised sky.  Elara wasn’t sure if it was the wind or the exhaustion that had settled into her bones like a cold stone, but even the usual warmth she found in tending to animals couldn't quite chase away the creeping gloom. 

The ranches of Prairie Hollow were usually abuzz with activity – a symphony of barking dogs, clucking chickens, and rustling cattle -  but today, silence hung heavy on the air like a shroud. The annual rodeo, normally a boisterous celebration of life and grit, had been cancelled this year, leaving a hollow ache in Elara's soul. She was about to enter the house when she spotted it – a single blue feather lying forlornly at the base of an old oak tree, shimmering under the fading sunlight.
