The amber glow of the sunrise painted long shadows across Ethan "Ironheart" Hayes's weathered face as he stood at the edge of the abandoned warehouse district. A low groan from the rusty skeleton of a factory building was the only response to the symphony of chirping birds and distant sirens that punctuated his early morning patrol. 

The air was thick with an earthy, metallic scent – the kind you couldn't quite place but knew meant trouble. It clung to him like sweat after a particularly grueling shift, mingling with the tang of diesel and smoke from the city’s ceaseless churn.  Ethan took another drag of his cigarette lighter than he needed, the cheap, plastic device hissing a lonely tune as it tried to spark life into the dead wood.

It was 5 AM on a Tuesday, a quiet morning in a world that never truly slept. And yet, Ethan felt an unsettling sense of dread creep up his spine. The city’s pulse was erratic today, a throbbing chaos that promised something more than the usual symphony of urban living. He knew it before he even stepped into the crumbling concrete of the abandoned warehouse district - this wasn't just another routine call to check for any stray fires or potential hazards. This felt...different.  Something sinister was brewing in the shadows.
