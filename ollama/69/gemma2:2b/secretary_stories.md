The air hung thick with the musk of expensive paper and stale coffee as Amelia Thorne hurried through the echoing halls of Thornton & Associates.  Her polished shoes clicked against the cold marble floor, each tap mirroring the anxiety drumming in her chest. This was no ordinary day; it was Wednesday, which meant Mr. Thornton’s weekly meeting at his secluded office on the top floor. 

Amelia, with her neat blonde hair pulled back into a tight bun and the crisp navy suit that seemed to defy any accidental spill of coffee, had become accustomed to this silent dance. She was the unseen orchestrator behind the meticulously crafted world of Mr. Thornton, the enigmatic CEO of one of the city's most successful publishing houses. 

Today's meeting felt different. There was an edge to Mr. Thornton’s usually jovial demeanor, a tension in his sharp blue eyes that Amelia had never witnessed before. It was a stark contrast to the usual calm he maintained, and it sent shivers down her spine. She adjusted her glasses nervously, feeling unseen scrutiny land on her. The meeting hadn't even begun yet, but already the air crackled with an ominous undercurrent of change.
