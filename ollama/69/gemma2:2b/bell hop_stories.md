Rain lashed against the frosted windows of The Grand Meridian Hotel, mimicking the drumming anxieties in Bartholomew "Bart" Winthrop's chest. The lobby was draped in swirling mist from an oversized fireplace, its crackling flames casting flickering shadows on the polished wood floors and ornate Victorian furniture. He straightened his crisp white uniform as he awaited a new wave of weary travelers seeking refuge from the storm. Each step echoed through the cavernous space, a lonely counterpoint to the steady symphony of the rain outside. Bart had been a bellhop at The Grand Meridian for three years – long enough to become almost invisible amidst the chaos and grandeur of the hotel's grand lobby. 

He sighed, watching as Mrs. Peabody, a woman perpetually draped in floral dresses and an air of perpetual bewilderment, dragged her suitcases through the throng of weary guests. Her face was etched with worry, even beneath the usual layer of powdered rouge. Bart knew she had travelled from Chicago, seeking answers to a mystery that had consumed her for weeks –  and he was tasked with delivering whatever cryptic notes or letters she might leave behind. 

He hoped tonight's delivery wouldn’t be too complicated. There were enough storms brewing in his own life, and the last thing he needed was another layer of intrigue on top of his already overflowing plate.
