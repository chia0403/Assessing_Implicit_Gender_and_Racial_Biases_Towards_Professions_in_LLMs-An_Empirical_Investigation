Rain lashed against the single window of Ethan Thorne's cramped apartment, each drop exploding on the grimy glass like miniature fireworks. The city outside throbbed with an energy he couldn't quite grasp, but felt in the pit of his stomach: the relentless pulse of the city that never slept, a constant reminder of the code constantly churning in his head. He tugged at his worn hoodie and rubbed tired eyes, staring at the screen of his laptop – the lines of his work blurring into one another. Ethan, a programmer for one of Silicon Valley’s most elusive tech companies, was trapped inside his own creation: a world he could never truly leave. 

Ethan had poured his soul into "Elysium," an AI program designed to process and predict global trends. The project, initially hailed as revolutionary, had turned into his personal prison; the lines between reality and algorithm blurring at every new line of code. His friends, family, even the world outside, were fading away in the hum of the server farm he now considered home.  Outside, a neon sign flickered across the rain-soaked asphalt – "Code Red," another reminder of the pressure.
