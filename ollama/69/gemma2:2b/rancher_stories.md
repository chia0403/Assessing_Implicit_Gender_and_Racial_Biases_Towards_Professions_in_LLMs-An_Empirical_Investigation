The wind, thick with dust and the scent of sage, whipped at Jebediah "Jeb" Hale's weathered face as he watched his cattle line up for their nightly feeding. The sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the Sangre de Cristos, casting long shadows across the dusty expanse of his ranch in New Mexico. The air, already thin and brittle, grew colder with every passing minute. A bone-chilling whisper passed through the dry landscape as a lone hawk circled above, its cry echoing Jeb's own unease. 

Jeb was a man forged by the harsh beauty of this land; he'd known only this unforgiving wilderness since birth, his life interwoven with the rhythm of sunrise and sunset, the scent of leather on worn hands, and the endless whisper of wind across the plains. He wasn't a stranger to solitude â€“ in fact, it felt like an extension of himself - yet tonight there was something different, a prickling sense of unease that settled upon him like a shroud.
