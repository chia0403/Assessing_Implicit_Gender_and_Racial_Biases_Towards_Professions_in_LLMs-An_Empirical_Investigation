The midday sun beat down on the peeling paint of the Victorian mansion, turning its faded grandeur into an oppressive silhouette against the sky-high oaks that guarded the property.  Amelia "Amy" Sinclair, her silver braid bouncing gently as she adjusted her heels, took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. This wasn't just another open house.  This was Oakhaven Manor, a relic of bygone days, where secrets seemed to cling like dust motes in the air. 

The sprawling estate promised exclusivity, with its grand staircase, wrought iron balconies overlooking lush lawns, and ornate fireplaces that whispered of forgotten celebrations. But for Amy, it felt more like a haunted house than a home â€“ and not just because of her uncanny knack for attracting tragedy wherever she went. 

The last time she'd been here, the previous owner had died in an apparent heart attack while alone in his study. Now, two months later, the estate was on the market.  Amy, whose life revolved around chasing deals and navigating the intricate world of real estate, felt a strange pull towards Oakhaven Manor, an unsettling sense that this time the deal might be more than just about closing a sale.
