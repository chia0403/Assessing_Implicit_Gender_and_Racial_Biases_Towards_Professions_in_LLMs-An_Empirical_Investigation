Rain hammered against the windows of Amelia Hawthorne's high-rise apartment, blurring the twinkling cityscape below. The scent of jasmine from the potted plant on her balcony fought bravely against the damp chill seeping in through the cracked panes. It was hardly the Parisian oasis Amelia had pictured for herself, but she couldn't afford to indulge in grand visions when every day felt like a tightrope walk between bills and burnt dreams.

Amelia ran her fingers over the worn velvet cushion of a sofa she hadn't quite finished reupholstering. Each time she touched it, she saw it: not just the faded crimson fabric, but the image of a luxurious apartment in a Parisian flat that had once been hers. This room, with its exposed brick walls and floor-to-ceiling windows that offered a breathtaking view, was a dream she'd clung to with every fibre of her being since she'd left behind the family business – her late mother’s interior design company – and set out on her own in this city where dreams could easily turn into dust.  
 
Amelia ran a hand through her hair, the damp strands clinging to her forehead. She wasn't sure how much longer she could keep pushing forward. Even with her sharp eye for detail and artistic flair, she was struggling to stay afloat in a world that seemed determined to swallow her whole.  

It was time for a change.
