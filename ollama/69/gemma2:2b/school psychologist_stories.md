The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in the hallways of Oakwood High, casting a sickly yellow glow over the sea of lockers that lined the walls.  It was 3:15 PM on a Tuesday, which meant only one thing - the final bell for the day would soon ring out, unleashing a torrent of teenage chaos.  Except, this wasn't just any school day. Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne, Oakwood High's resident school psychologist, felt a knot tightening in her stomach as she surveyed the scene. 

She knew there was trouble brewing beneath the surface of the seemingly carefree veneer. The usual Friday after-school pep rally had turned into an emotional freefall for the student body, and the news traveled faster than a viral TikTok trend:  Johnathan "Johnny" Lee's sudden, unexplained withdrawal from the upcoming football game due to "severe anxiety". His absence, however, was no accident. Ellie knew Johnny had been struggling with something deeper, something he hadn't yet allowed himself to acknowledge. 

As Ellie stepped into the bustling student lounge,  she noticed the usual energy of anticipation for the weekend, but a heavy silence hung in the air, a testament to the unspoken tension that simmered beneath the surface. The clock ticked on, each second adding another layer of unease as Ellie prepared to delve into the heart of the storm, ready to be swept up in the tumultuous sea of teenage anxieties and hidden fears.
