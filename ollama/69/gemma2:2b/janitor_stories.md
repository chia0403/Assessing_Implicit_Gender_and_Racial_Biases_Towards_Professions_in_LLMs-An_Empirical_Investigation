The fluorescent lights hummed, casting an anemic glow on the grimy floors of the old Metropolitan Opera House. Dust motes danced in the fading light, swirling like miniature galaxies around Arthur "Ace" Miller's worn-out boots. Ace, a quiet man with calloused hands and eyes that missed nothing, moved through the backstage labyrinth like a ghost – invisible, yet present at every whisper of wind, every creak of an aged wooden beam. 

The Opera House was a symphony in decay. Its gilded grandeur had long surrendered to the weight of time and neglect. The whispers of forgotten melodies echoed off the empty wings, a melancholic reminder of the magic Ace tried hard to preserve.  As he swept the worn-out carpet in a corner reserved for the costume department – the last remnants of a once vibrant life force – Ace felt the familiar sting of loneliness, another lonely note in this symphony of decay.

**Setting:** The Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, 1930s - mid-century modern design era.  The Opera House is filled with opulent and ornate details, but also shows signs of wear and tear: chipped paint, peeling wallpaper, dusty cobwebs, and the occasional leaky pipe.


**Character:** Arthur "Ace" Miller, a veteran janitor in his late 50s, quiet and observant. He knows every nook and cranny of the building, its secrets, and its silent whispers.
