Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the rugged coastline of Cornwall, casting a golden glow over the narrow cobbled street of St. Ives. The air was thick with the smell of saltwater and freshly cut stone, carried on the breeze that had been howling through the streets all day. Amidst the bustling crowd of tourists and locals alike, one man stood out - his name was Asher Fletcher-Wyatt, a master stone cutter with a reputation for crafting some of the finest granite sculptures in the county.

Asher's eyes, a deep shade of blue that seemed to bore into those he met, narrowed slightly as he surveyed the crowd. He had been working on a particularly tricky piece all day, and was starting to feel the weight of it - literally, as his arms ached from hours of precision cutting. The sound of seagulls crying overhead and the gentle lapping of the waves against the shore did little to calm his frazzled nerves.

As he watched, a group of rowdy schoolchildren made their way towards him, laughing and chattering excitedly about the ancient ruins that lay just beyond the town's limits. Asher's eyes flickered towards the distant silhouette of the Helford River estuary, where his family had lived for generations - a place he knew all too well, and yet still felt drawn to like a moth to flame.

Something was stirring in the depths of St. Ives that day, something that would disrupt the tranquility of this sleepy coastal town forever. And Asher Fletcher-Wyatt, with his keen eye for detail and his deep understanding of the stone that flowed through him, was about to find himself at the very center of it all.
