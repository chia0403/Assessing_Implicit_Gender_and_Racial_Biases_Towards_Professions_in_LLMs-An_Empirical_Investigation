Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emily Alexandra Thompson stood at the edge of her office's windowsill, gazing out at the misty dawn breaking over the sleepy coastal town of Ravenswood-by-Sea. The salt air carried the sweet scent of blooming sea lavender and the sound of seagulls echoed through the streets below. It was a peaceful morning, a far cry from the chaos that often erupted in her dental practice.

As she sipped her coffee, Emily couldn't help but feel a sense of unease creeping over her. She had just received an unexpected phone call from her old friend and colleague, Dr. Henry Lee, who had been practicing medicine on the other side of town for years. His tone was hushed and worried, and he hadn't even bothered to ask how she was or what she'd been up to lately.

"All I can say is that something's wrong," Emily said aloud, her brow furrowed with concern. "What is it, Henry? What have you found?"

But there was no answer on the other end of the line. Just an oppressive silence that seemed to stretch on forever. With a sigh, Emily set her coffee down and picked up the phone to try again.

Little did she know, this was just the beginning of a case that would test all her skills â€“ both as a dentist and as a detective.
