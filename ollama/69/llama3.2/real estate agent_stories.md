Here's a story opening and setting for you:

Opening:

As she stood at the edge of the rooftop bar, sipping her champagne and gazing out over the glittering Manhattan skyline, Olivia Elizabeth Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that this was it - the moment she'd been waiting for. The city lights twinkled like diamonds below, and the sound of the jazz band drifting through the air seemed to match the beat of her own heart. It was a night that would go down in history as the night Olivia made her move.

Setting:

The Thompson Realty office, located on the 23rd floor of the luxurious One57 skyscraper, was bustling with activity as the sun set over the Hudson River. The once-fledgling real estate agency had grown into a powerhouse under Olivia's guidance, thanks to her sharp instincts and razor-sharp wit. As one of the top agents in the city, Olivia knew every nook and cranny of Manhattan - from the high-end boutiques on Madison Avenue to the trendy startups in Brooklyn.

Olivia's own apartment, just a few blocks away, was a testament to her success: a sleek, modern penthouse with a breathtaking view of Central Park. She had spent countless hours here, planning her next big move and strategizing her sales pitches. Tonight, however, she had bigger plans - and nothing could stop her from achieving them.

As the clock struck 9 PM, Olivia finished her drink and made her way to the elevator, her designer heels clicking on the polished floor. She was about to embark on a journey that would change her life forever - one deal at a time.
