Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the small town of Willow Creek like a dirty blanket, shrouding its streets in a damp mist that clung to every surface like a bad habit. In the cramped kitchen of his worn-down apartment above Joe's Plumbing, Jack Sebastian "Sebastian" Thompson hunched over a stained counter, rubbing the fatigue from his eyes with the heel of his hand. His messy brown hair was slicked back with a thin layer of grease, and his faded "Joe's Plumbing" apron hung in tatters on a hook behind him.

Sebastian had been up since 3 AM, wrestling with a stubborn clog in Mrs. Jenkins' bathroom that had left her shrieking like a banshee at dawn. It was going to be one of those days. As he poured himself a lukewarm cup of coffee from the pot that had been sitting on the counter since last night's dinner, the phone on his nightstand jolted him back into reality with its ear-piercing shrillness.

"Joey's Plumbing," Sebastian grumbled, not bothering to hide the groggy tone in his voice. "Sebastian speaking."

But the only response was static â€“ and an unknown number that didn't want to stay on the line.
