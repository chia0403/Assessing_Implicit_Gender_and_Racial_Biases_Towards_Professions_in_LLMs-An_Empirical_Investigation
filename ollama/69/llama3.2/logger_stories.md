Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the dense forest of Red River County, Tennessee, when Jack Elijah Jenkins woke up to the sound of birds chirping and the creaks and groans of the old cabin he called home. It was 5:30 AM on a crisp autumn morning, the kind that made you want to throw open the windows and breathe in the fresh air. Jack lay in bed for a moment, listening to the peaceful sounds of nature, before throwing off the covers and getting dressed in the dim light.

Jack was a logger by trade, working for a small outfit on the outskirts of town. He'd been doing it for years, ever since his father had passed away and left him the family business. Jack's cabin was just outside of town, near the edge of the forest where he spent most of his days chopping down trees and hauling them to the mill.

As he made his way downstairs, the aroma of bacon sizzling in a pan greeted him, courtesy of his trusty old cook stove. Jack poured himself a cup of coffee and sat down at the table, watching the sun rise higher in the sky through the small window above the sink. It was going to be a good day.

This is just a starting point, but I hope it gives you an idea of who Jack Elijah Jenkins is and where he lives!
