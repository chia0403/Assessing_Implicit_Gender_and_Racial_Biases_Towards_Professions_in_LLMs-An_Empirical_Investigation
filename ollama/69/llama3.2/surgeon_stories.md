Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Ethan Alexander Wynter stepped out of his small, cluttered apartment and onto the crisp morning air of New Haven, Connecticut. The fog that had rolled in off Long Island Sound was slowly lifting, revealing a misty dawn that cast an eerie glow over the city. As he made his way to his car, parked on the quiet street lined with ancient oak trees, Ethan couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had been growing inside him since the night before.

A successful surgeon at New Haven Hospital, Ethan was no stranger to high-stakes environments, but something about the case he'd reviewed earlier that evening felt off. The young patient's diagnosis and treatment plan were sound, yet a nagging doubt lingered in his mind like an open wound. He pushed the thought aside as he started the engine and pulled out of his parking spot, but it was too late to shake the feeling.

As he merged onto I-95, the hum of the city grew louder, a constant reminder that New Haven was a place where medicine and mayhem often walked hand in hand. The streets were already alive with the sounds of rush hour, but Ethan's mind was still focused on the case, his eyes scanning the road ahead as he headed towards the hospital.

Little did he know, this ordinary day would soon become anything but ordinary for him...
