Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the vast expanse of Interstate 40, casting a dark and foreboding shadow over the endless stretch of asphalt that stretched out before truck driver Augustus "Gus" Thompson like an invitation to adventure. Gus had been driving for hours, his Peterbilt 389 rumbling along the highway as he navigated through the remnants of a storm that had rolled through the region earlier in the day.

As he pulled over at a rundown truck stop in rural Tennessee, Gus lit up a cigarette and gazed out into the darkness, feeling the weight of his responsibilities bearing down on him like the crushing pressure of the tires on his wheels. He was a lone wolf, with no family to speak of and a job that kept him on the move from one end of the country to the other. But despite the isolation, Gus had grown accustomed to the freedom of the open road, and he felt a deep connection to the land and the people he met along the way.

As he sipped his coffee and scanned the horizon, Gus noticed a figure standing off to the side of the truck stop, watching him with an intensity that made Gus's skin prickle with unease. The man was tall and lean, dressed in worn jeans and a faded denim jacket, and Gus couldn't help but wonder what had brought him to this place, and what he wanted.

Gus's eyes narrowed as he took another drag on his cigarette, his mind already racing with possibilities and his hand instinctively reaching for the CB radio that hung from his dashboard. He was a man of habit and routine, but there was something about this stranger that made him feel like anything could happen at any moment, and Gus was ready to roll.
