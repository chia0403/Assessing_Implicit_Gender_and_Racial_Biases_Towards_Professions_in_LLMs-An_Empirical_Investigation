Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Phoenix glistened like polished onyx as Asher Everett Thompson stepped out of his small office building and into the cool night air. A fog machine hummed in the background of the abandoned warehouse across the street, casting an eerie mist over the deserted parking lot. It was 9:47 PM, and Asher had just finished a long day of crunching numbers for his clients.

As he pulled on his waterproof jacket, a hint of anxiety crept into his chest. The annual audit deadline loomed, and Asher's team at Thompson & Associates had yet to finish reviewing the financials for their largest client, the Arizona-based tech firm, NovaSpire. He quickened his pace, his eyes scanning the empty sidewalks as he made his way towards the car parked behind the office building.

The fluorescent lights of the parking garage flickered like fireflies in the darkness, casting an otherworldly glow over Asher's determined face. With a deep breath, he slipped into the driver's seat and started the engine, feeling the familiar rumble beneath him as the car came to life. Little did Asher know, this ordinary night was about to take an extraordinary turn.
