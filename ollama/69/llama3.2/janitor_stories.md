Here's a potential story opening:

The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the worn linoleum floor of Oakwood High School's east wing. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and yesterday's lunchroom leftovers, a testament to the fact that the custodial staff was still struggling to keep up with the demands of the school's cafeteria during the morning rush.

Among the rows of dusty lockers and cluttered classrooms, one figure moved unseen, his cart rattling behind him like a metronome. His name was Jasper Everett Wystan, but he went by Jake - the janitor who kept the hallways spotless, if not exactly the faculty members' favor.

Jake had worked at Oakwood High for over five years, watching generations of students come and go, each one leaving behind a trail of crumbs and broken dreams. He knew every nook and cranny of the school's labyrinthine corridors, every hidden corner where secrets were whispered and laughter was stifled. And yet, despite his proximity to the heart of the school, Jake felt like an outsider - a ghost hovering on the periphery of the student body.

As he made his way down the deserted hallway, his cart creaking beneath the weight of the cleaning supplies, Jake couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change. The air seemed charged with an electricity he'd never quite felt before, like the whispers of a storm brewing on the horizon. And for once, Jake wasn't just worried about cleaning up after the school's inhabitants - he was worried about what might be coming for him.
