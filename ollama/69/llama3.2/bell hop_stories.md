Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans whispered secrets to the crumbling Victorian mansions that lined the Mississippi River. In the heart of the French Quarter, a small, family-owned hotel stood as a testament to a bygone era - the Belle Époque Hotel. Its ornate facade, adorned with intricate ironwork and faded silk drapes, seemed to lean inwards, as if sharing a hidden truth.

Amidst the hustle and bustle of the hotel's lobby, where jazz music wafted through the air and the scent of beignets lingered in every corner, 23-year-old Félix Étienne Dupre polished his bell hop shoes with precision. A scion of the city's oldest families, Felix had once been groomed for greatness - a life of luxury and privilege that he'd seemingly abandoned for the humble pursuit of serving guests.

Now, as he expertly swept the foyer floor with a worn broom handle, Félix couldn't help but feel like the forgotten son, struggling to find his place in the city's ever-shifting tides. Little did anyone know, however, that Felix had secrets hidden beneath his impeccable suit and charming smile - secrets that would soon set him on a collision course with the mysterious forces that haunted the shadows of the Belle Époque Hotel.

How's this for a starting point?
