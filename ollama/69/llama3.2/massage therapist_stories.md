Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a massage therapist:

The sun had long since set over the small coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint shops and restaurants that lined its streets. In the heart of this sleepy community, a serene oasis stood in stark contrast to the bustling world outside: Havenwood Massage Therapy.

Amidst the calming ambiance of Havenwood, 32-year-old Emilia Ruby Wilder went about her evening routine, expertly kneading the kinks from a particularly tense client's shoulders. As a licensed massage therapist with a gift for easing muscle tension and soothing the mind, Emilia had built a loyal clientele among Tidal Cove's residents.

As she finished up her final appointment of the day – a young mother named Sarah, who was struggling to recover from a pregnancy that had left her with chronic lower back pain – Emilia took a moment to survey her tranquil workspace. The scent of essential oils and the soft hum of a white noise machine created a soothing backdrop for her profession.

Emilia's own life was not without its stresses, however. A recent break-up with her long-term boyfriend had left her feeling lost and uncertain about her future. As she gently guided Sarah out of her chair and into the calming atmosphere of the waiting room, Emilia couldn't shake the sense that something was stirring beneath the surface of her peaceful existence – a sense that would soon be revealed to be more than just a minor adjustment to her daily routine.
