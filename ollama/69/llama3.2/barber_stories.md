As he worked, Jack couldn't help but think about the upcoming town festival, which would bring in more customers than usual. He had big plans to showcase his skills, perhaps even win the coveted "Golden Scissors" award for best barber in Willow Creek. But little did Jack know, this year's festival would be anything but ordinary...
