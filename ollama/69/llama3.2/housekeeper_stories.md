As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, Emily Rose Wilson made her way through the quiet streets on foot, her worn boots making soft crunching sounds in the dew-kissed grass. It was her daily routine to tidy up the old Victorian mansion that stood at the end of Elm Street, its grandeur and beauty slowly being devoured by the passing years.

Emily had been the housekeeper for the Ravenswood family for nearly a decade, ever since she'd lost her job at the local hotel due to economic cuts. She took pride in her work, carefully polishing the silverware, dusting the intricate moldings, and making sure every room was spotless. But despite her dedication, Emily couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to life than just cleaning up after others.

As she approached the mansion's front door, a chill ran down her spine. She had heard whispers of strange occurrences within its walls - doors creaking open on their own, lights flickering in the dead of night, and the sound of footsteps echoing down deserted corridors. Emily had always dismissed these rumors as mere town gossip, but tonight, something felt off.

She pushed open the heavy oak door and stepped into the foyer, where a faint scent of decay hung in the air. The chandelier above her head cast flickering shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the very spirits of Ravenswood's past were watching her every move. Emily shivered, feeling a sense of foreboding wash over her. Little did she know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would change her life forever.
