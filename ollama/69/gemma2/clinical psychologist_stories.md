The insistent hum of the city throbbed through Dr. Amelia Thorne's window, a counterpoint to the sterile silence of her office.  Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist painting of neon and grey. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender essential oil and anticipation. 

Amelia straightened her navy blazer, smoothed down the front of her crisp white blouse, and glanced at the clock on her wall. Five minutes past appointment time. It wasn't uncommon for new patients to be late, nervous butterflies fluttering in their stomachs. But this one... something about him felt different. His name was Elias Blackwood, and his request had been unusual: a consultation specifically regarding dreams. 


Amelia's practice primarily dealt with anxiety, depression, and relationship issues, but the human mind was a labyrinthine maze, and she found solace in exploring its hidden corners.  Elias Blackwoodâ€™s email, sent late one Friday afternoon, promised an intriguing journey into the depths of the subconscious. He wanted to unravel the meaning behind his dreams, dreams that were, according to him, "more vivid than reality."

A shiver ran down Amelia's spine. This wasn't just another session; it felt like stepping into a story yet untold, one with potential for both fascination and danger.
