The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Vance's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his sweat-soaked shirt into a second skin. The asphalt shimmered in the July heat, a black mirror reflecting the endless expanse of the Nevada desert. Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, mocking the stillness of Eli's heavy work gloves as he tamped down another layer of gravel on the desolate stretch of Highway 95.  

It was a monotonous existence, punctuated only by the drone of passing trucks and the occasional screech of a hawk circling overhead. Yet, there was a certain rhythm to it, a satisfaction in knowing he was building something, even if it was just another temporary fix on this unforgiving ribbon of road that snaked through the heart of nowhere. 


Eli squinted at the horizon, searching for any sign of movement beyond the familiar mirage shimmering above the asphalt.  His gaze settled on a lone, beat-up pickup truck lumbering towards him, kicking up a cloud of dust in its wake. He knew it was just another weary traveler seeking refuge from the desert's relentless glare, but Eli couldn't shake the feeling that this time, something was different.
