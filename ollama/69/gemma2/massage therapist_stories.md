Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Now, blurring the neon sign that flickered with an encouraging blue glow. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne meticulously folded linen towels, her movements precise and calming, like the tide rolling in and out on a quiet shore. The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy musk of sandalwood and the faint tang of petrichor seeping through the cracked windowpane.  A steady rhythm of rain beat against the roof, a comforting counterpoint to the low hum of the diffuser. 

Amelia was ready for her first client of the evening. She glanced at the clock – 6:30 pm sharp – and straightened the embroidered "Serenity Now" badge pinned to her teal scrubs. The bell above the door chimed softly, signaling the arrival of someone seeking solace amidst the storm.
