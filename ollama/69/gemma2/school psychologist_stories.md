The stale scent of hand sanitizer and overused tissues hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin. She sighed, pushing her glasses further up her nose as she surveyed the small, cluttered room. 

It was the "safe space," as they called it â€“ a brightly painted alcove within the bustling halls of Willow Creek Elementary School, meant to be a refuge for students grappling with anxiety, grief, or whatever else life had thrown their way.  But today, it felt less like a haven and more like a padded cell, its cheery posters now mocking Amelia's mounting frustration. 

The day had begun with a string of escalating meltdowns, culminating in the latest crisis: eight-year-old Lily Garcia, who was refusing to leave the bathroom, convinced that monsters lurked beneath the sink.  Amelia rubbed her temples, knowing that this wasn't just about imaginary creatures. Lily was clearly struggling, and Amelia needed to find a way through to her. 


The setting is a quiet corner of Willow Creek Elementary School, specifically the designated "safe space" for students experiencing emotional distress. The room is small, brightly decorated with posters meant to be comforting, but today feels oppressive and ineffective.
