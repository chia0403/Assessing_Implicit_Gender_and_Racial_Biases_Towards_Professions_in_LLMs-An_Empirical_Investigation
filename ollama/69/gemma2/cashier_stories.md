The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like a hive of agitated wasps, casting a sickly yellow glow over everything in Brenda Jean Cartwright's world. It was 7:45 pm on a Tuesday, which meant two things: the last rush of shoppers before closing, and another night of listening to bad pop music piped through the store speakers at ear-splitting volume. Brenda sighed, adjusting her nametag that felt heavier than usual with each passing hour. The smell of stale popcorn lingered in the air, mingling with the faint scent of bleach from the floor cleaner she'd just finished using.

Brenda surveyed the scene before her: a crumpled receipt snagged on her scanner, a mountain of empty shopping bags waiting to be recycled, and a queue forming at her register that stretched almost to the frozen food aisle. She braced herself for the onslaught. This was it, the grand finale of another monotonous shift at the "Family Fun Mart," where dreams came to die and only the most resilient could survive.
