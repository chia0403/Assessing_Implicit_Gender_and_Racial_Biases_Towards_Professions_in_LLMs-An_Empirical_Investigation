The air in "Dr. Abernathy's Holistic Healing Haven" was thick with lavender oil and hushed expectations. Sunlight slanted through stained glass windows, painting rainbows across the worn Persian rug where Amelia Beatrice Thistlewood sat perched on a wobbly stool. Her pencil tapped impatiently against her notepad, a metronome marking the seconds between patient appointments. The phone rested silent beside her, mocking her boredom.

Amelia was the gatekeeper of this haven, a receptionist who could practically recite Dr. Abernathy's eclectic philosophy from memory: "Balance your chakras, release your inner critic, and let the universe flow through you."  She found it all vaguely pretentious, but she wasn't here to judge. She was here to pay her bills, file forms, and occasionally offer a sympathetic smile to someone seeking spiritual enlightenment in a world obsessed with material gain.

Today, however, felt different. The usual buzz of anxious anticipation was replaced by an unsettling stillness. Even the wind chimes hanging from the ceiling seemed to sigh instead of sing. Amelia glanced at the clock: 10:58 am. Dr. Abernathy's first appointment was in two minutes.  He would be here, wouldn't he?


The chime announcing a new arrival shattered the silence. Amelia straightened, a sliver of excitement threading through her boredom. This might just be an interesting day after all.
