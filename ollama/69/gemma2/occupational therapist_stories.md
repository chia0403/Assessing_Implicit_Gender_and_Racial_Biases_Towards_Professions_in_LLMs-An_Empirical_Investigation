The scent of antiseptic and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia "Amy" Rosewater as she entered the therapy room. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the quiet space. It was a stark contrast to the storm raging outside, rain lashing against the glass panes like angry fists. 

Amy smoothed down her teal scrubs, adjusting the stethoscope hanging around her neck. Her gaze fell on the crumpled figure slumped in the corner of the room - Daniel Blackwood, a young musician whose world had been turned upside down by a devastating car accident six months ago. His guitar lay beside him, its once vibrant finish dulled with neglect. Amy took a deep breath, pushing aside the familiar ache in her heart for his lost dreams. Today was different.  Today, she felt a flicker of hope. 


**Setting:** A bustling rehabilitation center nestled on the outskirts of a small coastal town, known for its dramatic weather and quaint charm. The therapy room is bright and airy, designed to be calming and welcoming, with soft lighting, plush seating, and a wall dedicated to motivational quotes.
