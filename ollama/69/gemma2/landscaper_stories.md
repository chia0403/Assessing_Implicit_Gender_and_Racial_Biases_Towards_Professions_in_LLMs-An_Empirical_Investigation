The humid Florida air clung to  Emmeline "Em" Juniper like a damp towel. Sweat trickled down her neck, mingling with the dirt caked on her arms from another long day wrestling with palm fronds and hibiscus vines. The midday sun beat down mercilessly, turning her small landscaping business's usual vibrant green haven into a shimmering mirage.  

She squinted at the sprawling estate before her, its manicured lawns stretching out like an emerald carpet punctuated by sapphire blue pools and fountains that gurgled with lazy indifference. This was "Paradise Point," the latest project of the notoriously demanding Ms. Agatha Sterling, a woman who apparently took the word "perfection" quite literally. Em had heard whispers about her - the unforgiving critiques, the sudden firings, the chillingly polite threats.  

Em wiped her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a streak across her already sun-kissed skin. The mansion loomed before her, a fortress of polished marble and ornate wrought iron, its grandeur somehow dwarfed by the oppressive heat. Taking a deep breath, Em adjusted her straw hat and walked towards the towering oak trees lining the driveway, knowing that Paradise Point wouldn't be paradise for long if she didn't get to work.
