The sun, a fiery orb peeking over the jagged peaks of the Obsidian Mountains, cast long shadows across Elias Blackwood's fields. Dew clung to his calloused hands like tiny, shimmering jewels as he surveyed his corn crop – rows upon rows of emerald green, promising a bountiful harvest if the storms held off. 

Elias, a man whose weathered face bore the map of a lifetime spent under the relentless sun, inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and ripening grain filling his lungs. It was a familiar comfort, a smell that spoke of life and sustenance, woven into the very fabric of his being. He'd been born and raised on this land, the soil beneath his feet as familiar as his own heartbeat. This farm, nestled in the valley at the foot of the Obsidian Mountains, had seen generations of Blackwoods come and go, their lives etched into the sturdy oak trees lining the property boundary.  

But a shadow hung over Elias's heart today, darker than the looming storm clouds gathering on the horizon. A letter from the King's tax collector lay crumpled in his pocket, demanding an unprecedented sum. The news had been delivered by a grimy messenger with eyes like chipped flint, whispering of lean times and harsh laws.  Elias knew the threat – if he couldn’t pay, his farm would be seized, another casualty in the King's ever-expanding grip on the land. 


The wind picked up, rustling through the cornstalks, a whispered plea for change. Elias gripped the handle of his plow, steel meeting worn leather, and steeled himself for the day ahead. He wouldn't let this land be taken from him, not without a fight.
