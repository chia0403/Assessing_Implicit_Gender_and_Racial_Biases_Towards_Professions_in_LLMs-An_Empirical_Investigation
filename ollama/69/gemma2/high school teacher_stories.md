The air in Mrs. Evelyn Beaumont's classroom hummed with the low buzz of anticipation. The fluorescent lights cast a sterile glow on the rows of desks, each adorned with a half-finished essay on Shakespearean sonnets â€“ the very topic that had sent shivers down their spines. Even the usually boisterous chatter of her Advanced Placement English class at Oakwood High seemed muted today, replaced by the rustling of papers and nervous coughs. 

Evelyn watched them all from behind her meticulously arranged desk, a worn copy of "Hamlet" resting beside a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee.  She adjusted her spectacles, their silver frames glinting in the harsh light, and took a deep breath. This wasn't just another day grading essays; this was about igniting a spark in these young minds, showing them that literature wasn't just dusty words on a page but a powerful lens through which to view the world.

"Alright class," she began, her voice surprisingly calm despite the butterflies fluttering in her stomach. "Let's delve into the world of Shakespeare..." 


Her words were cut short by a loud crash from the hallway, followed by a chorus of gasps and whispers. Evelyn felt a chill run down her spine. This wasn't just any Tuesday afternoon; something was amiss.
