The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and cherry blossom nail polish. Sunlight streamed through the dusty front window of "Polish & Prose," illuminating motes dancing in the warm haze.  Eleanor Beatrice Finch, known to most simply as Ellie, hummed along to the crooning jazz emanating from the ancient radio tucked into a corner, her nimble fingers expertly shaping the sharp edges of Mrs. Henderson's almond-shaped nails.

Ellie loved her little shop nestled on the quiet, tree-lined street in Maplewood. It was more than just a place to apply nail polish; it was a sanctuary for whispered secrets, shared anxieties, and the occasional burst of laughter. 


Mrs. Henderson, a pillar of the community with a penchant for flamboyant fuchsia nails, leaned back in her chair, sighing contentedly. "Ellie, you're a miracle worker," she declared, admiring her reflection.  

"Just doing my job, Mrs. H," Ellie replied, a playful smirk dancing on her lips. 


But behind the friendly facade, Ellie felt a gnawing unease. Lately, the town had been buzzing with whispers of a mysterious figure, dubbed "The Crimson Claw," who left cryptic messages scrawled in blood red paint.  Ellie brushed it off as sensationalism until yesterday, when she found a chilling message scrawled on her own shop door:

_Your secrets will be revealed._


A shiver ran down Ellie's spine. Could the whispers be true? Was "The Crimson Claw" coming for her and the secrets hidden within the walls of "Polish & Prose"?
