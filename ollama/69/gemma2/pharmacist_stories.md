The bell above the pharmacy door chimed a tired welcome as Amelia Genevieve Hastings adjusted her spectacles and peered over the counter.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the shop's dusty windows, illuminating shelves crammed with jars of brightly colored pills and powders, tubes of ointments, and stacks of prescription pads. The scent of menthol and lavender hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia after thirty years behind this counter in Willow Creek's oldest pharmacy.

Willow Creek itself was a town caught between time.  The once bustling main street, lined with weathered brick buildings and storefronts displaying hand-painted signs advertising everything from "Fresh Pies" to "Barber Shop," had seen better days. The arrival of the bypass years ago had siphoned off most of the traffic, leaving behind a sleepy community clinging to its past.  Even the old pharmacy felt it â€“ the slow dwindling of customers, the rising stacks of outdated inventory, the whispers about closing shop for good that Amelia tried not to hear. 


But amidst the quiet melancholy, there was still life in Willow Creek. The steady stream of regulars who knew her name and her remedies by heart. The farmers who stopped by every Friday morning with their aches and pains.  And sometimes, even a stranger or two seeking solace in the familiar comfort of an old-fashioned pharmacy.
