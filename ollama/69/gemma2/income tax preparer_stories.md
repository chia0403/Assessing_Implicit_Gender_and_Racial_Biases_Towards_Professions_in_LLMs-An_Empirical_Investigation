The air in Mildred Penelope Bartholomew's office smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation. It was Tax Season, that magical time when spreadsheets ruled the world and the faint scent of burnt sugar (courtesy of her neighbour's annual batch of rum balls) mingled with the scent of panic from clients clutching receipts like lifelines.  

Mildred sat behind her worn oak desk, a mountain of W-2 forms piled precariously before her. She chewed on the end of her pen, her brow furrowed as she deciphered the labyrinthine tax code for the tenth time this week. A faint tremor ran through her right hand, a telltale sign that the caffeine withdrawal was setting in. 

Outside, the first snow of the year drifted lazily down, coating the quaint New England town of Maple Creek in a blanket of white.  But inside Mildred's office, the only storm brewing was the one raging within her own head as she wrestled with a particularly complex return - the kind that made her wish she had chosen a less stressful career path, like perhaps, alpaca farming.
