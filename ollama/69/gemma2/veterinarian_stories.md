Dr. Elara Thorne squinted at the small tabby cat writhing on the examination table. Its emerald eyes were dilated, pupils like pinpricks against the milky white glare of her head lamp.  A thin mew escaped its throat, a pathetic whimper that tugged at Elara’s heart.

The setting sun cast long shadows through the dusty windows of Thorne's Animal Clinic, bathing the waiting room in an orange glow. The usual comforting warmth was absent tonight. A palpable tension hung in the air, broken only by the ticking of the antique clock on the wall and the rhythmic hum of the air conditioner struggling to keep up with the late summer heat. 


Elara glanced at the worn photograph perched precariously on a dusty shelf - her father, his face creased with a familiar smile, holding a ginger kitten identical to the one now in her care. The memory, bittersweet and achingly real, reminded her why she had dedicated her life to healing these creatures, their fragile lives entrusted to her capable hands.
