The grease-stained overalls felt like a second skin to Amelia "Amy" Petrova. The air in her garage hung thick with the scent of motor oil and burnt rubber, a symphony of scents she found infinitely more comforting than any perfume.  A single bare bulb cast harsh light across the worn concrete floor, illuminating rows of tools meticulously arranged along the walls like an artisan's palette. 

The setting sun bled through cracks in the rusted corrugated metal roof, painting long shadows that stretched across Amy's workbench. She was knee-deep in the innards of a vintage Chevy Nova, its engine purring contentedly after a thorough tune-up. 


Amyâ€™s Auto Repair wasn't just a business; it was her sanctuary. A haven from the world where she could speak the language of pistons and spark plugs, where logic and precision reigned supreme. It was here, surrounded by steel and grease, that Amy truly felt alive.
