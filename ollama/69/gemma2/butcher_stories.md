The air hung thick with the scent of iron and brine in Arthur Benedict Percival's butcher shop. It wasn't the typical, welcoming aroma of freshly baked bread or roasting poultry that often greeted patrons at the corner shops lining High Street. No, this was the smell of raw, honest living – the earthy tang of beef fat rendered into glistening lard, the metallic sharpness of cleavers meeting bone, and the salt-laced musk of cured ham hanging from the ceiling beams like spectral guardians. Arthur, a man whose name was as weighty as his butcher's block, surveyed his domain with a gruff satisfaction. His apron, stained with decades of blood and sweat, was a badge of honor in this world of crimson muscle and quivering fat. He ran a calloused thumb over the chipped surface of the counter, its worn wood a testament to countless transactions – deals struck, gossip shared, and lives lived within these four walls. 

The morning sun cast long shadows through the dusty shop window, illuminating the rows of hanging carcasses and neatly stacked cuts of meat. Arthur had been born into this trade, his lineage stretching back generations in their small Yorkshire village. But lately, a creeping unease had settled over him like a shroud. The whispers in the marketplace spoke of strange occurrences in the nearby woods, tales of livestock disappearing without a trace and unsettling omens painted on the crumbling walls of abandoned cottages. Arthur dismissed them as superstition, yet a sliver of doubt gnawed at his usually unflappable resolve. 


This was more than just business; this was his legacy, his lifeblood.  He wouldn't let some phantom scare him away from what he knew best. Not without a fight.
