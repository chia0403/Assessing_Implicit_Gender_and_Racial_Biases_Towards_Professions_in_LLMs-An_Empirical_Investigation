The wind whipped across the dusty plains of Montana, whistling a mournful tune through the rusted spokes of Caleb "Cal" Thornton's old pickup truck. Sun bled into the horizon, casting long shadows across the sprawling expanse of Thornton Ranch. Cal squinted against the fading light, his weathered face etched with years of hard work and relentless sun.  His calloused hands gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white as he navigated the rough dirt road, heading back from town after a tense meeting with the bank. 

The bank wasn't just lending him money anymore; they were demanding terms, pushing him towards selling off portions of his land.  Cal felt a familiar knot tighten in his chest - a fear that had been gnawing at him for months. This ranch, passed down through generations of Thorntons, was more than just land; it was lifeblood, legacy, and the only home he'd ever known.  

As dusk deepened into night, Cal turned onto the familiar dirt road leading to his homestead. A lone coyote howled in the distance, its mournful cry echoing through the stillness. He knew the wolves would be hungry tonight, just like him. The fate of Thornton Ranch, and everything it stood for, hung heavy on his shoulders.
