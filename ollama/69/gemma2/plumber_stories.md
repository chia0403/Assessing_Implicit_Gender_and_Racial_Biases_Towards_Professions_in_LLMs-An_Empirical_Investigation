The insistent drip-drip-drip from Mrs. Periwinkle’s leaky faucet was like a metronome keeping time with Finnigan “Finn” O'Malley’s mounting frustration.  He sat perched precariously on the edge of her antique clawfoot tub, his toolbox splayed open beside him like a fallen treasure chest, but no combination of wrenches or pliers seemed to tame the defiant spout. 

The air in the bathroom was thick with the scent of lavender hand soap and Mrs. Periwinkle’s ever-present potpourri, which Finn suspected was responsible for most of his current headache. The house itself, a Victorian on the edge of Maplewood's historic district, groaned with age.  Sunbeams slanted through dusty windows, illuminating cobwebs clinging to faded floral wallpaper. A portrait of a stern-looking gentleman in a handlebar moustache watched him from above the fireplace, judging every frustrated grunt and muttered curse.

Finn sighed, wiping sweat from his brow with a grimy rag. This job was turning out to be more than just a quick fix. He'd been here for hours, battling stubborn pipes and cryptic notes left by the previous plumber, who seemed to have communicated primarily in cryptic symbols. 


Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Maplewood’s quaint streets.  Finn knew he was running out of daylight. He had a date with destiny later – or at least, with a good burger at Marty's Diner – and Mrs. Periwinkle's leaky faucet couldn't hold him hostage forever.
