The early morning mist clung to Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewickâ€™s boots like stubborn cobwebs as she trudged through the overgrown path towards the aviary. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, punctuated by the raucous calls of unseen parrots and the occasional mournful caw of a crow.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the dense canopy of ancient oaks that shielded the sanctuary from the bustling city just beyond its borders. Eleanor, her auburn hair escaping from its braid, pulled a battered canvas bag closer as she navigated the winding path. Within it lay a collection of brightly coloured toys, fresh fruit, and the calming lavender oil she used to soothe agitated birds.  

Eleanor was the sole caretaker at Whispering Pines Sanctuary, a haven for rescued and injured animals, nestled deep within the sprawling London suburbia. For her, it wasn't just a job; it was a calling, a sanctuary born from her own childhood spent amongst the whispers of woodland creatures and the vibrant chatter of caged birds. But lately, things felt different. A sense of unease had settled over the sanctuary, a feeling that something was amiss beneath the tranquil facade.
