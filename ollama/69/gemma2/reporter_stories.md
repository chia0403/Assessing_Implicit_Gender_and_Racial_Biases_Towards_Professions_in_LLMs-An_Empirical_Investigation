The humid New Orleans air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and impending rain. A fat, orange sun was sinking behind the gothic spires of St. Louis Cathedral, casting long shadows across Jackson Square. Tourists swarmed the area, snapping photos of street performers and haggling over souvenirs, oblivious to the darkness brewing in Amelia "Amy" Dupont's heart. 

Amy, a reporter for The New Orleans Advocate, hunched over her notepad at a rickety wrought-iron table outside Cafe du Monde, her pen scratching furiously against the paper. Her latest story – about the mysterious disappearance of a prominent art collector – was proving more complex than she initially thought.  The trail was cold, the witnesses evasive, and every lead seemed to end in a dead end. 


Her phone buzzed with another message from her editor, reminding her of the looming deadline. Amy sighed, swirling the lukewarm chicory coffee in her cup. This wasn't how she envisioned her night going. She wanted to be at home, curled up with a good book and a glass of wine, not chasing shadows in the heart of the French Quarter. But duty called, and Amy Dupont was a woman who always answered the call.
