The scent of lemon polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint whiff of pipe tobacco from Lord Ashworth's study. Elara Thistlewick hummed softly as she buffed the brass handles on the antique writing desk, each movement precise and deliberate. Sunlight streamed through the high windows of the drawing-room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness.  

It was a Wednesday morning in late September, and the grand Victorian manor house nestled on the edge of the Yorkshire moors felt as still and expectant as a slumbering beast. The air, crisp with autumn's first bite, carried whispers of change. Elara, a woman who had spent her entire life within these walls, knew that change always came, whether it was in the shifting seasons or the ever-evolving moods of the household she served.  


Elara Thistlewick, a wisp of a woman with hair as dark as a raven's wing and eyes that held the quiet wisdom of years spent observing, surveyed the scene before her. This was her domain, this tapestry of polished wood and faded grandeur, each piece whispering stories of past generations. She knew every creak of the floorboards, every flicker in the gaslight, every secret tucked away in the shadows.  

But today, Elara felt a tremor of unease. The usual hum of activity was absent, replaced by an unsettling silence that pricked at her senses like the first frost on a cold morning. Something was different. Something was coming.
