The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and pine sap as Elias Thorne surveyed his latest creation. A rough-hewn rocking horse, its coat stained a deep chestnut brown and its mane crafted from thick strands of jute, sat proudly in the center of his workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the intricate carvings on its flanks – swirling patterns that mimicked the wind rustling through autumn leaves. Elias ran a calloused hand over its smooth, wooden surface, a quiet pride swelling in his chest. 

His workshop, nestled amidst the rolling hills of rural Vermont, was more than just a place of work; it was a sanctuary. The creaking floorboards whispered stories of generations past, the scent of aged wood a comforting familiarity, and the constant hum of insects outside a soothing lullaby. But today, a sense of unease lingered in the air. A crumpled letter, lying forgotten on his workbench, bore the stark black ink of a summons – an invitation to return to the bustling city he’d left behind years ago, a place filled with memories both cherished and painful.
