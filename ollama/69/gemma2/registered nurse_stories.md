The fluorescent lights hummed above Clara Amelia Nightingale, their sterile glare reflecting off the polished linoleum floor of the emergency room. She wiped sweat from her brow with a sigh, the familiar scent of antiseptic stinging her nostrils. The ER was a battlefield tonight - a symphony of panicked coughs, pained groans, and the rhythmic beeping of heart monitors. It was always chaos at St. Jude's on Friday nights, but this felt different, heavier somehow. 


Clara adjusted the stethoscope around her neck, its cool metal offering a small comfort against the rising heat of the room. She checked her watch – 10:47 PM. Her shift wasn’t over for another two hours, and she already knew it would be a long one. The door to the trauma bay swung open, revealing a frantic paramedic ushering in a young boy, his chest barely rising with each shallow breath. Clara's heart clenched – this was going to be a night she wouldn’t forget. 


Clara Nightingale, registered nurse, braced herself. This wasn't just another Friday night at St. Jude's. This was life and death playing out in the harsh glare of the emergency room.
