The air in Penelope Everleigh's office was thick with the scent of jasmine tea and unfulfilled wanderlust. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature constellations. A map of the world, its edges worn from countless tracing fingers, hung above her desk, a tapestry of vibrant colors begging to be explored. Penelope, however, stared at a computer screen displaying a spreadsheet overflowing with canceled bookings and client complaints. 

The pandemic had dealt a brutal blow to her travel agency, "Voyager's Delight," leaving it teetering on the brink of closure.  But Penelope refused to surrender. She was a woman who thrived on adventure, both vicariously through her clients and firsthand in her own travels. Giving up wasn't an option. 


The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cluttered desk as Penelope sipped her tea, her gaze drifting towards the framed photograph of herself standing triumphantly atop Mount Kilimanjaro. A flicker of hope ignited within her. If she could conquer a mountain, surely she could navigate this crisis. She just needed a spark, an idea that would reignite the flames of travel passion in both herself and her clients.
