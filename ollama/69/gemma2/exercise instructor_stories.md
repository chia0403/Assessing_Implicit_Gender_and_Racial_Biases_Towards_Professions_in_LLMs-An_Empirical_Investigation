The air thrummed with anticipation as Amelia Juniper adjusted the last yoga mat on the brightly-lit studio floor. Sweat already beaded on her brow, a testament to both the warmth of the summer day and her own pre-class jitters.  This wasn't just any Tuesday morning class at "Zen Zone"; it was "Yoga for Warriors," designed specifically for veterans struggling with PTSD. Amelia felt a familiar tightness in her chest, a blend of excitement and trepidation. 

The studio itself was a haven from the city's clamour - walls painted calming shades of turquoise and lavender, soft instrumental music playing just below audible volume, the scent of sandalwood incense hanging heavy in the air.  But for Amelia, it was more than just the ambiance; this space represented an opportunity to use her passion for yoga as a bridge to healing, a silent promise whispered to those who'd seen too much darkness.  

The studio door creaked open, ushering in a handful of men, faces etched with weariness and guarded expressions. Amelia smiled, welcoming them into her sanctuary, hoping that within these next sixty minutes, the tension in their shoulders would ease, and the light in their eyes might flicker back to life.  This wasn't just about physical postures; this was about finding balance, breath, and a moment of peace in the storm.
