The acrid sting of smoke filled Elias Thorne's nostrils before the sirens even started wailing.  He lived two blocks from Station 19, close enough to feel the rumble of an approaching engine through his floorboards. But this wasn't the rhythmic shudder of their familiar apparatus; it was a frantic, desperate tremor, like a beast struggling to break free. Elias shoved on his boots, already grabbing his helmet as he raced out the door.  

He lived in a crumbling brownstone neighborhood, a patchwork of families clinging to hope in a city that seemed perpetually on the brink of collapse. Rust-eaten fire escapes clung precariously to buildings like skeletal fingers reaching for a dying sun. The streets were choked with smoke, turning the twilight sky an angry bruise.  Flames licked at the windows of Mrs. O'Malley's bakery, casting grotesque shadows across the brick facades. Elias knew that bakeries were notorious in fire situations - their ovens fueled by a terrifyingly efficient inferno. He could only hope the old woman had made it out.   


This was Station 19.  
This was home. 
And this was about to get real.
