Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Vance's office, each drop exploding on the glass like a tiny bomb. The wind howled a mournful tune outside, rattling the old building in its skeletal frame. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and nervous anticipation. Eleanor, perched at her mahogany desk, ran a hand through her already dishevelled auburn hair. 

The case files lay spread before her like a battlefield, each one representing another soul caught in the tangled web of legal complexities. This was the life she'd chosen, navigating the murky waters of justice, fighting for those who couldn't fight for themselves. But tonight, as the storm raged on outside mirroring the tempest brewing inside her, Eleanor felt a familiar sense of weariness creeping in. 


The setting is a small, gritty law firm nestled in an old, neglected building in a rain-soaked city during a particularly stormy night.
