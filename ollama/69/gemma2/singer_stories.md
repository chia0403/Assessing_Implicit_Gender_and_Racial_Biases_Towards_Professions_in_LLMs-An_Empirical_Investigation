The humid air hung thick in the back room of The Rusty Trombone, clinging to Amelia Juniper’s sweaty skin like a second shirt. She adjusted her worn-out guitar strap, the brass buckle digging into her shoulder. Outside, the raucous laughter and clinking glasses of Friday night spilled onto the street, a symphony of revelry that felt miles away in this dim, dusty space. 

Amelia took a deep breath, the scent of stale beer and cigarette smoke filling her lungs. This was it. Her chance to prove she wasn't just another dreamer chasing an impossible melody. Tonight, at The Rusty Trombone, Amelia Juniper would become a name whispered on the lips of music lovers in this city, or fade into the anonymity she’d known all her life.  


**Setting:**

A dimly lit, smoky backroom of a ramshackle bar called "The Rusty Trombone" located in a bustling but gritty part of an unnamed city. The air is thick with humidity and the sounds of revelry from the main bar are barely audible through the closed door. It's Friday night, promising a full house and a chance for Amelia to perform.
