The rain hammered against Detective Amelia Harding's trench coat, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the slick pavement. Her breath puffed out in white clouds, quickly swallowed by the thick, grey fog that had descended upon the city like a shroud. Neon signs cast an eerie glow through the mist, their colours bleeding together into a watercolour nightmare.

Amelia adjusted her fedora, the brim casting a shadow over her weary eyes. The air was heavy with the scent of rain and decay, a familiar aroma in this part of town. She stood before a crumbling brick building, its windows boarded up like vacant eyes staring out at the desolate street. This was where it had all started: a brutal murder, discovered by a shivering vagrant amidst the overflowing bins behind the abandoned diner.

Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the grim reality that awaited her within those darkened walls. She flicked on her flashlight, its beam slicing through the fog like a beacon of hope in this desolate landscape. It was time to face the darkness.
