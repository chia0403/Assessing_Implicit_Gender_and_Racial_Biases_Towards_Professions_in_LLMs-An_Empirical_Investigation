The faint scent of peppermint and bleach hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elara Nightingale.  She stood poised by the stainless steel sink, her reflection shimmering in its mirrored surface. Today was Tuesday, which meant she'd be seeing Dr. Petrov's usual roster of elderly patients – mostly quiet, shuffling folk with stories etched onto their faces like fine lines around a smile. 

Elara adjusted the sterilized gloves on her hands, the rubber prickling against her skin. Outside, the sun beat down on Willow Creek Dental, its rays casting a warm glow through the dusty windows. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an artificial chill that contrasted sharply with the summer heat outside.  The waiting room was sparsely populated this morning – just Mrs. Henderson, a retiree with perpetually wrinkled brows and a penchant for gossip, thumbing through a dog-eared magazine. 

Elara took a deep breath, steeling herself for another day of scaling teeth and probing gums. It wasn't the most glamorous job, but it was hers. And as she glanced down at her reflection, her hazel eyes crinkled in a small smile – there was something strangely satisfying about bringing a little bit of order to the chaos within those pearly whites.
