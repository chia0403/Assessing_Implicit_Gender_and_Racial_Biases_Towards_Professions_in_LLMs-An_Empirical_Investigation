The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of numbered chairs in the waiting room.  Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back into a tight bun, tapped impatiently against the counter with the heel of her palm. She hated this time of day – just before lunchtime, when the clinic was always packed with patients squeezing in quick appointments before their midday break. 

Eleanor adjusted the stethoscope around her neck, the cold metal a familiar comfort against her skin. She’d been a phlebotomist at Serenity Health Clinic for five years, and she'd perfected the art of extracting blood with a minimum of fuss.  Most people didn't even flinch anymore when she approached, knowing that Eleanor's touch was gentle, almost reassuring.

But today felt different. The air crackled with a nervous energy, the usual hum of conversations muted by a tense silence. And then there he was, stepping into the waiting room – a tall man with haunted eyes and a slumped posture. He looked like he hadn't slept in days. Eleanor’s pulse quickened.  This wasn't just another routine blood draw. This man carried a story in his weary gaze, a story she knew she was about to be drawn into.
