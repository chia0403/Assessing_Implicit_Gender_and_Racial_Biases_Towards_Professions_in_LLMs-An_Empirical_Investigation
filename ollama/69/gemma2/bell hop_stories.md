The Grand Astor Hotel shimmered under a late-summer sun, its gilded facade reflecting the heat like a mirage.  Inside, amongst the hushed whispers and echoing clink of champagne flutes, flitted Bartholomew "Bart" Quince, the hotel's most efficient and observant bellhop. Bart knew every corner of the sprawling establishment – from the dusty antique books in the library to the hidden service staircase that led to the top floor suites. He could anticipate a guest’s needs before they even voiced them, predict their destination based on the weight of their luggage, and decipher the stories behind the hurried glances and tightly pursed lips.  Today, however, something was different. A palpable tension hung in the air, a disquiet that rippled through the usually smooth symphony of service and social ease. Bart couldn't shake the feeling that the Grand Astor, with its ornate chandeliers and polished marble floors, was about to become the stage for something dramatic, something far more exciting – or terrifying – than his usual rounds.
