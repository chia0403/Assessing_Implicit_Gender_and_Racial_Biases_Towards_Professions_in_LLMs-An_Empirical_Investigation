Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Beaumont hated Mondays. Not for any particular reason, just by force of habit. It was the same routine every week: the early morning commute through gridlocked streets, the endless stream of patients with chipped teeth and anxieties about their fillings, the smell of antiseptic that clung to her clothes like a second skin. But today, Monday felt different. 

The air in her small dental practice on Elm Street hummed with an unusual energy, a subtle shift she couldn't quite place.  Perhaps it was the way sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, painting dancing patterns on the worn linoleum floor. Or maybe it was the new receptionist, Grace, who had arrived that morning with a smile so bright it could rival her own set of pearly whites.

Whatever it was, Dr. Beaumont couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to happen. And as she adjusted her glasses and surveyed her waiting room filled with anxious faces, she knew this Monday wouldn't be like any other.
