The damp earth clung to Bartholomew Quillfeather’s boots as he trudged across the sprawling lawn of Blackwood Manor. Dewdrops, like tiny diamonds, glittered on the blades of emerald grass, reflecting the first pale rays of dawn filtering through the ancient oaks that lined the estate's borders. He inhaled deeply, savoring the crisp morning air, the scent of damp earth and blooming honeysuckle mingling in his nostrils.  

Bartholomew wasn’t a man of grand ambitions. His life revolved around the rhythms of nature, the silent symphony of birdsong, rustling leaves, and the gentle whisper of wind through the willow branches that swayed along the banks of the manor's reflecting pool. He tended to Blackwood Manor with the same reverence a sculptor treats his clay, shaping the sprawling gardens into verdant masterpieces for the unseen eyes of its occupants. 


His days were a tapestry woven from familiar tasks: pruning roses, trimming hedges, weeding flowerbeds, and patrolling the grounds for any sign of disturbance. Yet, beneath the placid surface of Bartholomew's existence, a seed of curiosity had been planted, taking root in the fertile soil of his imagination. For weeks now, whispers had circulated amongst the local villagers about strange occurrences within Blackwood Manor - shadows flitting at the edge of vision, muffled cries echoing from the darkened halls, and an oppressive silence that hung heavy over the usually vibrant estate.
