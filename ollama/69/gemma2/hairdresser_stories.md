The bell above the door jingled its familiar welcome as Emilia Rosalie Davenport stepped out into the humid June air. Sweat prickled on her neck despite the cool breeze blowing in from the open window of her salon, "Cuts & Curls".  A pungent mix of hairspray and lavender shampoo hung heavy in the air, a comforting scent that had become synonymous with home for her. The quaint brick building was nestled on a cobblestone street in Savannah, Georgia, its pastel blue paint peeling gracefully in places, revealing glimpses of the original brick beneath. 

Emilia surveyed the scene before her: tourists snapping photos of the moss-draped oaks lining the street, locals hurrying past clutching iced coffee cups, and, most importantly for her, two clients waiting patiently on her worn leather chairs. She inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar symphony of city life before heading back into her salon, ready to weave magic with scissors and color once more.
