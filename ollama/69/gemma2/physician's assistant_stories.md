The flickering neon sign outside "Doc Holliday's Urgent Care" cast long shadows across the rain-slicked asphalt. Inside, Amelia Harper, her scrubs damp from a hurried dash through the downpour, was already knee-deep in paperwork. A steady stream of patients, each with their own brand of misery, flowed through the cramped examination rooms. Amelia, a physician's assistant known for her calm demeanor and sharp wit, navigated the chaos like a seasoned conductor, her movements precise and efficient. Tonight, however, felt different. The air hung thick with tension, a palpable unease that prickled at Amelia's skin. She couldn't shake the feeling that tonight's storm wasn't just meteorological; something darker was brewing beneath the surface of this small town. 


**Setting:**

A bustling but rundown urgent care clinic in a quiet, rural town on the outskirts of New England. The town is shrouded in perpetual twilight thanks to its dense forests and frequent storms, lending an air of mystery and isolation.  The clinic itself is a testament to faded grandeur, with peeling paint, flickering fluorescent lights, and the faint scent of disinfectant clinging to the air.
