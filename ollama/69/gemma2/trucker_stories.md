The Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt like a hammer on an anvil. Sweat beaded on Elias “Easy” Davenport’s forehead, clinging to the dust that coated his weathered face.  He squinted at the endless ribbon of road stretching before him, each mile marker another tick on the clock counting down to Albuquerque and then home.  

Easy tugged at his collar, the worn denim straining against his thick chest. His rig, a hulking Peterbilt named "Blue Moon," hummed contentedly beneath him, a testament to Easy’s gruff affection for machines. He’d named her after a dream he'd had as a boy, of driving through endless night skies under a moon so bright it painted the world in shades of silver.  Now, years later, Blue Moon was his constant companion, a steel beast rumbling across America, carrying Easy’s hopes and dreams – and the occasional load of cattle feed – from coast to coast. 


This time, though, something felt different. The air was thick with anticipation, a low hum that resonated deep within him. Maybe it was the way the desert stretched out before him, an expanse of shimmering heat and dust that seemed to pulse with a hidden energy. Or perhaps it was the gut feeling that whispered in his ear, a primal instinct telling him this wasn't just another haul. This was a journey into the unknown.
