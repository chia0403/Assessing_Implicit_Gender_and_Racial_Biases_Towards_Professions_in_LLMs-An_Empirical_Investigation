The rain hammered against the windowpane, mirroring the frantic drumming in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's chest. Her normally tidy desk, usually an oasis of order amidst the chaos of the law firm, was now littered with case files and half-empty coffee mugs. A wave of nausea rolled over her as she stared at the most recent addition to the pile: a thick, intimidating document titled "Exhibit A - Deposition Transcript." 

Amelia, a paralegal for the prestigious Carter & Finch firm, had been entrusted with preparing for the high-profile case of State vs. Alistair Vance, accused of embezzling millions from a local charity. It was a case that could make or break her career, but right now, it felt like it was about to break her entirely.  

The office itself was a stark contrast to the raging storm outside. Gleaming mahogany desks and floor-to-ceiling bookshelves exuded an air of timeless sophistication. The firm, situated in the heart of New York City's financial district, occupied the top two floors of an imposing Art Deco building, offering panoramic views of the city that were usually a source of calm for Amelia. But tonight, the twinkling cityscape below seemed to mock her anxieties. 


The air was thick with tension, not just from the storm but from the looming deadline â€“ Vance's deposition was scheduled for first thing tomorrow morning.  And Amelia, despite working tirelessly, felt hopelessly unprepared.
