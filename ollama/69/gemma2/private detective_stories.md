The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Frankie "The Rat" Rastelli's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow on his already frayed nerves.  A greasy cigarette dangled from his lips, its glowing ember the only source of light in the dimly lit room beyond the flickering neon sign outside. He squinted at the rain-streaked window, watching the city of New Port drown beneath a curtain of grey water. 

The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee, cheap cologne, and desperation – a potent cocktail Frankie knew all too well. His phone lay on his desk, silent, a mocking testament to the fact that even in this city of sin, there were some secrets no one wanted revealed. He tapped the ash from his cigarette into an overflowing ashtray, its contents threatening to spill onto the floor.

He was Frankie "The Rat" Rastelli, private investigator, and tonight, he was drowning in a sea of unanswered questions. 


**Setting:** New Port – A sprawling, rain-soaked city on the edge of the continent, known for its seedy underbelly, vibrant jazz scene, and an atmosphere thick with both promise and despair.
