The bell above Amelia Thistlewick's shop door tinkled its mournful song as she pushed it open, stepping into the cool quiet of "Blooms & Banter." A wave of scent washed over her, a heady mix of lilies, rosehips, and the fresh earthiness of just-dug peonies. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating swirling motes and casting long shadows on the overflowing shelves stacked with vibrant blooms. 

Amelia sighed, running a hand through her unruly curls that always seemed to defy gravity. Today was supposed to be a day for new beginnings. A fresh start after the whirlwind of closing down her online flower subscription business and finally taking the plunge into opening a brick-and-mortar shop in her beloved seaside town of Saltwind Cove. 

But so far, the only "new beginning" she'd seen was a swarm of anxious bees trapped inside one of the greenhouse doors, buzzing furiously while Amelia struggled to open it without becoming their impromptu honeybee buffet.  


Saltwind Cove was perpetually bathed in a gentle haze, whether it was the salty sea air or the lingering scent of wildflowers that bloomed with reckless abandon along the rugged coastline. Amelia loved its quiet charm, its weathered cottages huddled together like gossiping old women, and the constant murmur of the ocean waves that seemed to whisper secrets only they understood.
