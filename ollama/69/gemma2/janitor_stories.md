The stale smell of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elias Thorne's threadbare uniform like a second skin.  He pushed his mop across the gleaming tile floor of the grand ballroom, its polished surface reflecting the dusty chandeliers that cast long, melancholic shadows across the room. The once vibrant space, now abandoned and echoing with the whispers of forgotten laughter, was a monument to a bygone era. 

Elias Thorne, known as "Thorny" to his few acquaintances, wasn't much for nostalgia. He preferred the quiet hum of the vacuum cleaner to the ghosts of parties past. As head janitor of the opulent Blackwood Manor, he kept this decaying relic afloat with a mop, a bucket, and an unwavering sense of duty. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down his spine as he rounded the corner, his worn leather boots echoing on the marble floor. 


He wasn't alone.
