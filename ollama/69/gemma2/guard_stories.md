The rusted hinges shrieked in protest as Sergeant Alistair Blackwood heaved open the iron gate.  A biting wind whipped through the skeletal remains of the ancient oak trees lining the perimeter wall, sending shivers down his spine despite the thick woolen cloak he wore. The flickering lamplight cast long, dancing shadows across the crumbling cobblestones of Fort Sentinel, bathing the desolate courtyard in an eerie, amber glow. 

It was a night for ghosts, Blackwood thought, and not the friendly kind that haunted children's stories. This fortress, perched precariously on the edge of the Windswept Wastes, had seen its share of horrors: marauding warbands, monstrous creatures from beyond the veil, and the slow, relentless erosion of time itself. 

Tonight, however, Blackwood was only worried about the mundane terrors that plagued a lone guard's night watch: the howling wind that sounded suspiciously like distant screams, the rustle of unseen things in the shadows, and the gnawing emptiness in his stomach that could rival the vastness of the Wastes themselves.
