The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Cartwright's head, casting a sterile glow on the brightly coloured plastic toys scattered across the floor. The smell of stale juice boxes and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional shriek of laughter or the whine of a frustrated toddler. 

Amelia watched from behind the kitchen counter, stirring a pot of oatmeal with a weary smile. It was her third day at "Rainbow Rascals," a daycare center tucked away in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of Portland, and already she felt the familiar tug of exhaustion pulling at her. The job was meant to be temporary, a stepping stone while she finished her anthropology degree, but lately it felt more like a quicksand pit dragging her down.

Outside, rain lashed against the windows, blurring the view of the overgrown parking lot. Inside, the chaos reigned supreme. A three-year-old named Timmy had taken up residence in the ball pit, wailing about being trapped, while another child, a sweet but perpetually nervous boy named Daniel, clung to Amelia's leg, whispering about monsters under the furniture.  

Amelia sighed. This was going to be a long day.
