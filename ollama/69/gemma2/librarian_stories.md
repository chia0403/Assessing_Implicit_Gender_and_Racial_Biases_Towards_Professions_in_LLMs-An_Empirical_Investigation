The musty scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea wafting from Mrs. Pettigrew’s perpetually simmering kettle.  Sunlight streamed through the arched windows of the Grandview Public Library, casting dusty motes to dance in its golden rays. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, surveyed her domain with a practiced eye. The silence was punctuated only by the gentle rustle of turning pages and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock that stood sentinel in the corner.

Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, loved this time of day – the quiet lull before the afternoon rush when children flooded the library for storytime and teenagers sought refuge between classes.  She was a creature of habit, her life revolving around the comforting rhythms of the library: meticulously organizing new acquisitions, mending torn pages with loving care, and guiding patrons through the labyrinthine shelves with a gentle smile and encyclopedic knowledge of every book under her care. 

But today, something felt different. A strange tension hummed beneath the surface of the usual serenity. The silence seemed to press in on Ellie, charged with an unspoken anticipation that prickled at her skin. As she reached for a discarded copy of "Pride and Prejudice," a single sheet of paper fluttered down from the high shelves, landing softly at her feet. It was pale and yellowed with age, its edges curling like dried leaves. On it, a single word, penned in elegant script: *Run*.
