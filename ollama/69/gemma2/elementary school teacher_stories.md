The fluorescent lights buzzed like a hive of restless bees above Ms. Elara Blackwood's head as she surveyed her classroom, Room 207 at Meadowbrook Elementary. It was the first day back after summer break, and the air thrummed with a nervous energy that only elementary school children could generate. Backpacks lay in disarray on the floor, crayons were scattered like fallen soldiers, and a half-eaten banana peel glistened ominously under the harsh glare. 

Ms. Blackwood sighed, smoothing her lilac cardigan over her crisp white blouse. She loved this time of year – the fresh start, the blank slates, the eager faces staring up at her with hope and curiosity. But this year felt different.  Something hung in the air, a tension that wasn't just pre-school jitters.

She scanned the faces before her – wide eyes, hesitant smiles, a few already whispering excitedly in groups.  But beneath it all, she saw a thread of apprehension, a shared unspoken fear that prickled at the back of her neck.
