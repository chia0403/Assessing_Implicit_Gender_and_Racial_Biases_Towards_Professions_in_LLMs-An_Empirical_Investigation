The bell above the door jingled a discordant melody as Amelia Thistlewick surveyed the sparse clientele in her salon. It was Tuesday afternoon, a notoriously slow time for business on Mulberry Street, even during the bustling summer months.  Amelia sighed, adjusting the crimson bandana tied around her fiery red hair. She'd been dreaming of opening "Thistlewick's Threads" since she was a girl, practicing intricate braids and bobs on her ragdoll collection. Now, two years into owning her own shop, the reality felt more like tangled yarn than a well-woven tapestry. The worn wooden floorboards creaked under the weight of Amelia's disappointment as she walked behind the counter, grabbing a faded gardening magazine to distract herself from the silence.  

Suddenly, the bell jingled again, this time with a different timbre. A gust of wind swept in, carrying with it the scent of fresh rain and... lavender? Amelia peeked out the window, her heart skipping a beat.  Standing on the sidewalk was a man unlike any she'd ever seen before. Tall and cloaked in shadows, he held an umbrella that seemed to shimmer with an unnatural light.  His features were obscured by the wide brim of his hat, but a single silver earring glinted against his earlobe like a captured star. He gazed up at her salon with an intensity that sent shivers down Amelia's spine. 


This was no ordinary customer.
