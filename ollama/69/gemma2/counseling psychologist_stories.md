The rain hammered against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the relentless rhythm of anxiety that thrummed beneath her skin. Outside, Seattle was shrouded in a perpetual twilight, the city's skyline a hazy silhouette against the leaden sky. The scent of damp earth and petrichor hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile, minimalist decor of her office –  a deliberate choice to create a sense of calm amidst the chaos of human emotions. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock on the wall: 4:57 PM. Five minutes until her last appointment of the day. She was due for a much-needed glass of wine and a good book, but a knot of apprehension tightened in her chest.  Her next client, a young woman named Clara, had requested to meet urgently, citing a "crisis." Eleanor hadn't been privy to the details, and a prickle of unease danced down her spine. 


**Setting:** A small, independent counseling practice nestled in a quiet neighborhood of Seattle, Washington. The city outside is perpetually overcast and rainy, mirroring the emotional climate of many of Eleanor's clients.
