The air inside Flight 347 hummed with anticipation, a low thrumming vibration that echoed Amelia Beatrice Finch’s own nerves.  She adjusted her navy blue uniform, smoothing down the crisp lines of her skirt and straightening the silver pins that held her nametag – AMELIA FINCH - to her lapel. Outside the cabin windows, the sprawling cityscape of Paris glittered like a jewel box below, each twinkling light a story waiting to be told. Amelia inhaled deeply, trying to quell the fluttering in her stomach. It wasn’t fear; she loved this part of her job, the pre-flight buzz, the chance encounter with strangers from different walks of life, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of overhead compartments as they stowed their belongings.

This flight was different though. Amelia knew it in the pit of her stomach. There was a weight to the air, a hushed tension that hung unspoken amongst the passengers.  It had started subtly – a few anxious glances exchanged, whispered conversations held just below audible volume. But as the plane taxied towards the runway, a palpable sense of unease settled over the cabin. 

Amelia's fingers tightened on her headset microphone. It was time to put on her professional face, to be the reassuring anchor amidst the swirling currents of anxiety.  She smiled, her eyes meeting those of a young woman clutching a tattered teddy bear. "Good evening, ma’am," Amelia said in her calmest voice. “Welcome aboard Flight 347 to London. We're expecting a smooth flight.”   But even as she spoke, a prickle of unease ran down her spine. This wasn't just another routine flight. Something felt deeply off.
