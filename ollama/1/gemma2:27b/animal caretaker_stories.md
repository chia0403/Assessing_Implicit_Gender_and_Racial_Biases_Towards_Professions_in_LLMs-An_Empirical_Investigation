The stench of wet dog fur and disinfectant hung heavy in the air of the Havenwood Animal Shelter. Amelia Beatrice Finch wrinkled her nose, but it was a familiar smell, one she'd grown accustomed to over the past decade. Her calloused hands gently stroked the matted fur of a scruffy terrier mix named Barnaby, who shivered under her touch despite the muggy July afternoon.

Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of the kennel, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the cacophony of cicadas droned on, punctuated by the occasional bark or meow from one of the countless cages lining the walls. Havenwood wasn't fancy, its paint peeling and its floors perpetually scuffed, but it was a sanctuary for forgotten souls â€“ lost cats, abandoned puppies, injured birds, and everything in between. Amelia considered herself their guardian angel, tending to their physical needs while whispering words of comfort into their anxious ears. Today, though, a knot of worry tightened in her chest. The shelter's funding was running dangerously low, and the threat of closure loomed over them like a dark cloud.

She needed a miracle.
