Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray.  The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and solder. Elias Bartholomew "Eli" Thorne tightened a screw on the circuit board he was meticulously assembling, his brow furrowed in concentration. Outside, thunder grumbled ominously, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eli himself. He'd been offered a job – a lucrative one, mind you –  that could finally pull him out of this ramshackle workshop and into something resembling stability. 

But it wasn't just the money that tempted him. This project, rumored to be some kind of groundbreaking new energy source, held the promise of pushing his skills further than he'd ever dared dream. Yet, a knot of unease tightened in his gut. The company offering the job was shrouded in secrecy, and whispers about their unorthodox methods circulated through the electrical underground like static. 


Eli paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. He knew this decision could change everything – for better or worse. The fate of his tiny workshop, his chance at a future, hung precariously on the next move he made.
