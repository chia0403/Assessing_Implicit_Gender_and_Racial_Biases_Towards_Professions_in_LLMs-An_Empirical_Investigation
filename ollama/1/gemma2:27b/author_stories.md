Rain lashed against the attic windows, each gust rattling the dusty panes like skeletal fingers tapping for entry.  Eleanor Blackwood, her forehead creased in concentration, ignored the tempest raging outside. Her cramped writing nook, nestled beneath the eaves, was a world unto itself, bathed in the warm glow of a single desk lamp illuminating stacks of handwritten manuscripts and overflowing mugs of lukewarm tea.

Eleanor, a woman whose silvering hair and sharp blue eyes hinted at a lifetime spent observing the human condition, tapped her pen against her lower lip. The words on the page before her felt hollow, lacking the vibrancy she craved. For weeks, she had been wrestling with the ending of her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the fog-choked streets of Victorian London. But inspiration, that fickle muse, had abandoned her.

Frustrated, Eleanor pushed back from her desk and rose, stretching her stiff limbs. She needed a change of scenery.  Perhaps a walk through the overgrown garden would clear her head.  As she moved towards the attic door, a faint scratching sound caught her attention. It seemed to be coming from behind one of the heavy oak bookcases that lined the walls.
