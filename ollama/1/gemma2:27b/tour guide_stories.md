The humid air hung thick over Charleston's cobblestone streets, heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and salt. Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair pulled back in a braid against the oppressive heat, adjusted the brim of her straw hat and smiled at her group of tourists. They were huddled together under the shade of an ancient live oak, its gnarled branches casting dappled patterns on the brick walkways.

Eleanor had been leading tours through Charleston for nearly a decade, each twist and turn of the historic city etched into her memory like a well-worn map. She knew every secret garden tucked away behind wrought iron gates, every ghostly tale whispered by the wind, every delicious bite to be savored in the bustling marketplace. But today felt different. A shiver ran down Eleanor's spine as she glanced at the old house looming across the street, its peeling paint and shuttered windows seeming to hold a thousand untold stories.  

It was the Davenport House, infamous for its rumored hauntings and whispered legends of lost love and buried treasure. Eleanor had always avoided it, drawn instead to the more cheerful narratives of Charleston's history. But today, something compelled her to point it out, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper as she recounted the chilling tales that clung to its crumbling facade.
