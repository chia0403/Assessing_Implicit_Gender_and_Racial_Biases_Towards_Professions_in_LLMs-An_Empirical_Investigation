The flickering neon sign outside read "Align & Thrive Chiropractic" in faded pink and green, casting an unnerving glow on the rain-slicked pavement. Dr. Emilia Ramirez sighed as she peered through the grimy windowpane. It was 8:57 PM, three minutes before closing time, and not a single soul had graced her doorway all day. This wasn't unusual, unfortunately. Ever since the new yoga studio opened across the street, offering "spiritual alignment" alongside downward dogs, Emilia felt like she was slowly being erased from the map of wellness seekers in this small coastal town. 

The rhythmic whoosh of waves crashing against the shore provided a melancholy soundtrack to her despair. Her office, nestled between a laundromat and a discount pet supply store, was starting to feel more like a purgatory than a place of healing. Emilia ran a hand through her thick, dark curls, the familiar scent of eucalyptus oil from her diffuser doing little to soothe her frazzled nerves. She yearned for the days when she could actually help people, when the clicks and pops of spinal adjustments were met with sighs of relief and renewed mobility. Now, it seemed, even the universe was conspiring against her success.
