The insistent chime of the seatbelt sign was like nails on a chalkboard to Elara Zephyr. She plastered on her practiced smile as she walked down the aisle, reminding passengers to buckle up for landing in Chicago. It wasn't the turbulence that bothered her, it was the feeling of being trapped. Trapped in this metal tube hurtling through the sky, trapped in her life. 

Chicago O'Hare International Airport stretched out beneath them, a glittering tapestry of runways and taxiways. Elara sighed, gazing at the familiar sight. For years she'd flown for Starbound Airlines, crisscrossing the globe, always arriving but never staying. Every landing felt like another missed opportunity, another chance to break free from her self-imposed exile.  

Today was different though. Today, she had a reason to stay.  A phone call earlier that morning had changed everything. A cryptic message, a voice whispering about a secret she needed to uncover. The voice belonged to someone Elara hadn't seen in years â€“ her estranged grandmother.
