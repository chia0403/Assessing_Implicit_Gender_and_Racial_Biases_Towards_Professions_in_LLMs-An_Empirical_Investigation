The aroma of vanilla and almond clung to Evangeline "Eve" Delacroix like a second skin. It permeated her clothes, her hair, even the air around her as she meticulously piped delicate buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake. Sunlight streamed through the expansive windows of "Eve's Edible Eden," her quaint bakery nestled on a cobblestone street in Charleston's historic district. The gentle hum of jazz drifted from a vintage radio perched on a shelf, harmonizing with the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Eve's piping bag against the smooth surface of the cake.  

But despite the idyllic setting and the sweet scent that enveloped her, a knot of anxiety tightened in Eve's stomach. Today wasn't just any ordinary day; it was the day she would face her biggest baking challenge yet - creating a masterpiece for the wedding of Charleston's most eligible bachelor, Theodore Ainsworth III.
