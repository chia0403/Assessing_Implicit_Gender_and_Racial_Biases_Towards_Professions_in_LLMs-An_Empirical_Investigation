The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth as Thaddeus "Tad" Blackwood hefted another section of ancient Douglas fir onto his shoulder. The trunk, scarred by years of relentless sun and wind, groaned beneath its weight. Tad grunted, his muscles straining against the monumental task.

Sunlight struggled to penetrate the dense canopy overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows that danced on the forest floor. Towering redwoods stood sentinel, their bark rough and gnarled like ancient skin. The only sound was the rhythmic chirping of unseen birds and the rasp of Tad's saw as he meticulously prepared the next section for felling.

This stretch of the Redwood National Park was his domain, a realm of towering giants and whispering secrets. He knew every bend in the creek, every hollow in the ancient trees, every rustle in the undergrowth. It was a world untouched by time, where nature reigned supreme. But today, something felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the surface, an unsettling premonition that prickled at Tad's skin.
