The stale scent of cigar smoke and desperation clung to the air of the Grand Blackwood Hotel like a stubborn ghost.  Leopold "Leo" Fitzwilliam navigated the opulent lobby with practiced ease, his uniform crisp despite the perpetual humidity clinging to New Orleans. He weaved between chattering socialites draped in pearls and diamonds, avoiding the stray champagne flutes abandoned on velvet banquettes. 

A symphony of clinking glasses, murmured conversations, and the distant thrum of a jazz band filtered through the gilded arches leading to the ballroom. Leo preferred the quiet rhythm of the luggage carts, the satisfying click-clack against the marble floor. Tonight, however, even that familiar sound seemed amplified, swallowed by the buzzing energy of the hotel's annual gala.

Leo paused, his gaze drawn to a lone figure slumped on a chaise lounge tucked into a shadowy alcove. A woman, cloaked in a shimmering emerald gown, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. Something about the way she sat, head bowed and shoulders trembling slightly, set Leo's instincts tingling. He approached cautiously, his bell hop charm momentarily forgotten.
