The flickering fluorescent lights of Northgate High's guidance office cast long shadows across Amelia Winthrop's desk. A mountain of college applications threatened to spill onto the floor, each one representing a nervous teenager pinning their hopes and dreams on acceptance letters. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear.

Outside, the autumn wind howled, rattling the windowpanes and whipping fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes across the schoolyard. A melancholic tune drifted from the radio in the corner, mirroring the wistful atmosphere that always seemed to settle over Northgate in late October. 

Amelia glanced at the clock: 3:47 pm. She knew she should be wrapping up for the day, but a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. The interview with Michael Evans, scheduled for 3:30 pm, had been conspicuously absent.  He was usually punctual, almost painfully so. Something was wrong.

She reached for Michael's file, his pale face staring back at her from the photo attached to the top sheet. A talented artist and quiet observer, he often confided in Amelia about the pressures of college applications and his anxieties about the future. The memory of their last conversation, where he'd confessed a growing sense of dread about something unknown, sent a shiver down her spine.
