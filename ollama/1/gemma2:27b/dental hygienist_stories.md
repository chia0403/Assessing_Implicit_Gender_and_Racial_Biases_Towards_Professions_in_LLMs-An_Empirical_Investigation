The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's workstation. A faint scent of antiseptic mingled with the metallic tang of blood, a familiar cocktail in this sterile world she inhabited five days a week. Outside, the July sun beat down on the bustling streets of downtown Chicago, but here, in Dr. Feldman’s cramped office, time seemed to move at a glacial pace. Amelia sighed, her gloved hand hovering over the patient's open mouth. He was a young man, barely out of his teens, with a nervous tremor running through his jaw. 

His name was Ethan, and he’d confessed to skipping flossing for months. Now, he was paying the price: inflamed gums and a cavity that needed immediate attention.  Amelia glanced at the clock on the wall. It was already past noon. Lunch felt like a distant dream, a mirage shimmering in the desert of her workday.
