Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's cruiser, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store sign across the street. The humid Miami air clung to her like a second skin, already making her regret wearing her wool coat.  A cigarette glowed precariously between her lips, ash threatening to spill onto her starched uniform shirt as she stared at the crime scene tape stretched taut across the alleyway entrance.

The air was thick with the metallic tang of blood and something else - a sickly sweetness Izzy couldn't quite place. It pricked at her nose, a jarring contrast to the damp asphalt and exhaust fumes. This wasn't just another routine drug bust gone wrong. This smelled...different.  

Izzy crushed the cigarette under her boot, a shiver running down her spine despite the oppressive heat. Something about this scene felt off, a discordant note in the symphony of urban decay that was Miami after midnight. She tugged her hat lower over her brow and squared her shoulders, stepping towards the alley, ready to face whatever lurked within its shadows.
