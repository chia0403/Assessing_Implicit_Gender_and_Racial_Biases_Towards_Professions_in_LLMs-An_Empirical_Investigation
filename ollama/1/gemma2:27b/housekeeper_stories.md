The insistent chirping of sparrows outside Amelia Rose Weatherby's window was the only thing louder than the incessant thrumming in her head. It was a rhythm of worry, punctuated by sharp stabs of panic every time she glanced at the dusty, cobwebbed grandfather clock in the corner. Six-thirty. Mr. Hawthorne would be home any minute.

Amelia smoothed down her faded grey uniform dress, already feeling the prickle of sweat under her starched collar. The grand Victorian manor house loomed around her, its shadowed hallways and cavernous rooms filled with a chilling stillness that amplified every creak of floorboards and sigh of the wind through the mullioned windows.  She had been here for three months, meticulously cleaning, polishing, and organizing the Hawthorne estate, yet it still felt foreign, like a dusty tomb holding onto forgotten secrets. 

Today was different. Today, Mr. Hawthorne, a reclusive millionaire known only by hushed whispers among the local townsfolk, was returning from an extended trip abroad.  Amelia wasn't sure why his arrival sent shivers down her spine. Perhaps it was the unsettling stories she'd heard about his eccentric nature, or the way the house seemed to hold its breath in anticipation of his return. Whatever the reason, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous was about to happen, and she wasn't sure if she was ready for it.
