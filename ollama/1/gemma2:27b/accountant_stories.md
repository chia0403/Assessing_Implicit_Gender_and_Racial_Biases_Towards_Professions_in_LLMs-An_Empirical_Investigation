Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quibbleton's office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in his chest. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Stacks of invoices threatened to topple over like Jenga towers, each one representing another sleepless night and a growing sense of dread.

Bart wasn't cut out for this. He hadn't dreamt of becoming a financial wizard, meticulously dissecting balance sheets and chasing down delinquent payments. No, Bart had yearned for a life filled with adventure, his head lost in dusty tomes about forgotten civilizations and mythical creatures. But life, it seemed, had other plans. His father, a stern man who valued stability above all else, had steered him towards accounting, deeming it "a respectable profession." 


Now, hunched over a flickering computer screen in a cramped office overlooking a perpetually grey cityscape, Bart felt the crushing weight of his father's expectations. He yearned for escape, for something to ignite the spark that had long since dwindled within him. Little did he know, fate was about to intervene in the most unexpected way.
