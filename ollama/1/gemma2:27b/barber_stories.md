The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of another customer into Antonio "Tony" DeMarco's barbershop. The scent of bay rum and shaving cream hung thick in the air, mixing with the faint aroma of freshly brewed espresso Tony always kept simmering on the back burner. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Mulberry Street, painting the cobblestone pavement in hues of orange and gold. 

Tony, a man whose hands moved with the practiced grace of a sculptor, paused mid-snip. He peered into the mirror, catching the reflection of the new arrival â€“ a young man, maybe in his early twenties, looking out of place amidst the worn leather chairs and vintage barber poles.  His clothes were rumpled, his hair a tangled mess, and there was a haunted look in his eyes that Tony had seen far too often on men who carried unseen burdens.
