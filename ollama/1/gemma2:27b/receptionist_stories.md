The incessant ringing of the phone pierced through Amelia Cartwright's carefully constructed world of calm.  She sighed, pushing away the dog-eared paperback sheâ€™d been enjoying during a rare lull in the lobby. The polished marble floor reflected the afternoon sunlight streaming through the arched windows of the Grand Meridian Hotel, casting long shadows from the towering potted palms. It was a grand place, all sweeping staircases and crystal chandeliers, but Amelia often felt more like a warden guarding its gilded cage than a welcoming face.

The phone shrieked again, demanding her attention.  She smoothed down her lavender uniform dress, straightened the nametag pinned to her breast, and answered with her practiced cheer. "Good afternoon, Grand Meridian Hotel, this is Amelia speaking. How may I direct your call?"
