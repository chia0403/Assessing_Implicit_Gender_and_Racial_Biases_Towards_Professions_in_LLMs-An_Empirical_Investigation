The crisp air of dawn stung Elias Thorne's cheeks as he unlocked the wrought iron gates of Blackwood Manor. The manor itself, a looming gothic behemoth with ivy clinging to its walls like skeletal fingers, remained shrouded in shadows. But the gardens, Elias' domain, were beginning to blush in the soft pink light filtering through the trees. Dewdrops clung to rose petals and spiderwebs glittered like jewels, transforming the neglected expanse into a world of ephemeral beauty.

Elias, with his weathered face and hands permanently stained green from years of tending the earth, surveyed his kingdom. Today was a big day. The manor, abandoned for decades, was finally being sold. A new family would soon walk these grounds, breathing life back into its dusty halls. Elias hoped they'd appreciate the legacy he'd painstakingly cultivated within these walls â€“ a secret tapestry woven from forgotten blooms and whispering trees.
