The acrid scent of peroxide hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet perfume of lavender shampoo. Outside, the neon sign of "Shear Perfection" buzzed intermittently, casting an erratic green glow across the rain-slicked pavement.  Eloise Moreau adjusted her tortoise shell glasses and surveyed her handiwork in the mirror. The auburn bob she'd crafted on Mrs. Henderson, a regular with perpetually anxious eyes, looked just right â€“ sleek, modern, and sure to boost her client's confidence. 

But Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't the haircut, nor the usual Friday night lull in customers. It was a deeper unease, a prickling sensation at the back of her neck like someone was watching her.  Maybe it was just the storm brewing outside, she thought, trying to dismiss the feeling. Yet, as she swept up the last strands of hair and turned to face the salon door, Eloise couldn't help but notice the shadow flickering just beyond the glass.
