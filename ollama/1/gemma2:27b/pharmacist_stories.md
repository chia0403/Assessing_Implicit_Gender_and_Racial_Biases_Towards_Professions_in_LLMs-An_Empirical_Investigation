Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the already dimly lit street outside. The neon sign above "Greencross Pharmacy" flickered intermittently, casting an eerie green glow across Eliza Davenport's tired face as she counted out ibuprofen capsules into a plastic vial.

Eliza, with her greying bun and perpetually smudged spectacles perched precariously on her nose, was the epitome of a seasoned pharmacist. She knew every cough syrup by its sweetness, every cream for its texture, and every customer by their ailment and usual brand preference. For thirty years she'd been dispensing medicine and solace in equal measure in this quiet corner of Ashtonville. Tonight, however, the familiar routine felt unsettling. The storm was relentless, mirroring the gnawing unease in Eliza's gut. It had started with a cryptic phone call earlier that evening – a hushed voice, demanding a specific medication she hadn't stocked in years. Then came the shadowy figure lurking outside her shop window, their gaze fixed and unwavering. 

As the bell above the door chimed, announcing a new customer, Eliza straightened her cardigan and braced herself. It was time to face whatever the storm – and this unsettling night – had brought to her doorstep.
