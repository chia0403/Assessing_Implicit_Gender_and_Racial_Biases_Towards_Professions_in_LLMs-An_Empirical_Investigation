Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eloise Hawthorne's third-grade classroom, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves outside into an impressionistic watercolour. The rhythmic drumming punctuated the excited whispers and rustling papers as Eloise's twenty bright-eyed students buzzed with anticipation for the annual Halloween costume parade.

Eloise, her chestnut hair pulled back in a neat braid, surveyed the room with a smile. Pumpkins, hand-painted with goofy grins, adorned every corner, while paper bats hung from the ceiling, casting playful shadows on the floor. 


She loved this time of year, the air thick with magic and possibility. Today, her students weren't just Eloise Hawthorne's pupils; they were superheroes, princesses, pirates, and mythical creatures, ready to embark on a fantastical adventure.
