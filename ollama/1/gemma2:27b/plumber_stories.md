The midday sun beat down on Elm Street, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves of heat.  A steady drip echoed from a fire escape above, mingling with the cacophony of car horns and distant sirens. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins wiped his brow with a grease-stained rag, squinting up at the leaky pipe spewing forth rusty water onto the sidewalk below.

He could see the whole of Elm Street stretching before him - the bustling bakery with its enticing aroma of fresh bread, the grumpy old bookstore owner perpetually shooing pigeons away from his stoop, and across the street, Mrs. O'Malley tending her overflowing flower boxes with a twinkle in her eye. 


Bart took a deep breath, steeling himself for the climb. He had a reputation to uphold - "Higgins Plumbing: We Fix What Leaks" was emblazoned on his rusty van parked below. And this leaky pipe, he suspected, was just the tip of the iceberg.
