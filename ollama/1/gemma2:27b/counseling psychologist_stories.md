The rain hammered against the bay windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the frantic drumming in her chest. Outside, the city lights blurred into an impressionist painting through the sheets of water. Inside, Eleanor stared at the empty chair opposite her desk, its plush velvet cushion a mocking reminder of the appointment she had just cancelled. A wave of nausea washed over her as she replayed the conversation in her mind: the strained voice on the other end, the hesitant request for an earlier session. Then, the abrupt click as they hung up, leaving Eleanor with a gnawing sense of unease. 

She knew it was irrational. Her patient, Amelia Croft, a young woman struggling with social anxiety, had a history of last-minute cancellations. But this time felt different. The urgency in Amelia's voice, the veiled fear she hadn't articulated...it all pointed towards something more than just a bout of nerves. Eleanor rose from her chair, pacing the length of her office, her mind swirling with possibilities.  Should she call Amelia back? Was it crossing professional boundaries to express concern? Or was she simply allowing anxiety to cloud her judgement? 

The storm raged on outside, mirroring the tempest brewing within Eleanor. She knew she had a decision to make, and it wouldn't be an easy one.
