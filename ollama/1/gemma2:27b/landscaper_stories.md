The late afternoon sun, already dipping low behind the San Gabriel Mountains, cast long shadows across Eleanor Finch's workbench. The scent of rosemary and thyme hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly turned soil. Scattered around her were trays overflowing with seedlings: plump purple basil, delicate sprigs of dill, and a riot of marigold colors. Eleanor carefully pruned a wayward branch from a young lemon tree, her calloused fingers moving with practiced ease. Her workshop, tucked away in a quiet corner of Pasadena, was a haven, a place where the chaos of the city faded away and she could lose herself in the intricate dance of nature's renewal.

But today, the usual tranquility felt tinged with unease. A crumpled flyer lay beside her trowel, its bold headline screaming: "Missing: Amelia Finch." Eleanor stared at it, her heart clenching. Her younger sister, usually so vibrant and full of life, had vanished a week ago, leaving behind only a chilling silence. The police investigation was stalled, the leads dwindling with every passing day.  Eleanor knew she couldn't simply stand by and wait for answers. Amelia needed her, and Eleanor, armed with her trowel and a fierce determination, was ready to dig deep into the mystery surrounding her sister's disappearance.
