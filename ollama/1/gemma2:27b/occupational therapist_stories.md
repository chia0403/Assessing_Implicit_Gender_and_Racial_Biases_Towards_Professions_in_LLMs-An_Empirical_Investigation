Rain lashed against the windows of the quaint Victorian house, each drop drumming a frantic rhythm on the glass panes. The scent of woodsmoke and chamomile tea mingled in the air, doing little to soothe the unease that gnawed at Amelia Rose Kensington's stomach. Her hands trembled slightly as she adjusted the worn leather satchel slung over her shoulder. This was it. After months of preparation, weeks of anxious anticipation, and a sleepless night spent fretting over every detail, she was finally here.

Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself. She had come to this remote seaside town on the rugged Cornish coast to help 8-year-old Thomas Blackwood, a boy who had suffered a debilitating stroke that left him paralyzed on his right side. The whispers about the Blackwood family – their reclusive nature, the tragic accident that claimed Thomas's parents – hung heavy in the air, adding an unsettling layer of mystery to this already daunting assignment. 


Amelia stepped onto the weathered porch and rang the doorbell, its rusty chime echoing through the deserted street like a mournful cry.  Her heart pounded against her ribs as she waited, the weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders. Would she be able to help Thomas? Could she mend not just his body but also the fractured spirit that she sensed lurked beneath the surface? Only time would tell.
