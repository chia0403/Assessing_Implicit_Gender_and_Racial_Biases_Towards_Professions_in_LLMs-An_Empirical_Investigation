The insistent chirping of cicadas filled the humid Louisiana air, a relentless soundtrack to Dr. Evangeline "Eve" Thibodeaux's mounting frustration. Sweat prickled on her brow despite the whirring ceiling fan struggling valiantly against the stifling heat in her tiny dental office.  A chipped porcelain figurine of a grinning alligator stared blankly from her desk, seemingly mocking her predicament. 

Three appointments had cancelled today, citing everything from "sudden swamp fever" to a "family crawfish boil." Eve sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. Business was slow in Bayou Rouge, even slower during the sweltering summer months when everyone preferred fishing and festivals to dental checkups. She needed patients, desperately, if she wanted to keep this practice afloat.
