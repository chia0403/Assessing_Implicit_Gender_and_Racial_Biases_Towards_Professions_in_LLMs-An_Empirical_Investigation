The wind whipped across the parched plains, carrying with it the scent of dust and desperation. Silas Ezekiel Thorne squinted against the glare as he surveyed his land. The once emerald-green pastures were now brittle and brown, the cattle gaunt and listless. Drought had gripped their corner of Montana for months, turning the sky into a relentless, brassy mirror.

Silas, weathered and wiry like the mesquite trees that dotted the landscape, adjusted the brim of his Stetson hat. He'd been born on this land, knew its rhythms as well as his own heartbeat. But even he had never seen a drought this fierce. The creek that snaked through his property was reduced to a shallow trickle, barely enough for the thirsty cattle to lap at.

He sighed, a sound heavy with worry. His forefathers had weathered countless storms and hardships. They'd carved a life from this unforgiving land. But Silas couldn't help but wonder if this drought was different, if it held the power to break even the Thorne legacy.
