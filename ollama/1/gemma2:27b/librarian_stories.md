Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, blurring the already faded gold lettering on the building's facade. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun and spectacles perched precariously on her nose, straightened a stack of overdue history books with a sigh. The air hung thick with the scent of aged paper and mildew, a comforting aroma that had permeated her life for the past forty years.
