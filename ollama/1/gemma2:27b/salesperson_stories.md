The humid air clung to Emilia Cartwright like a second skin as she navigated the crowded marketplace. Spices hung heavy in the air, competing with the scent of roasting meat and the earthy aroma of freshly tilled earth. Emilia, her blonde hair pulled back tight in a braid, expertly dodged a cart piled high with mangoes and squeezed past a group of women haggling over the price of silk. This was Marrakech, and Emilia thrived on its chaos.

She wasn't here for spices or silks, though. Her eyes were trained on a small stall tucked away in a shadowy corner, draped with faded tapestry and crammed with dusty trinkets. This was her destination: the stall of Ahmed ibn Khalil, famed collector of rare artifacts and Emilia's elusive target. Today, she hoped to finally convince him to part with the ancient amulet whispered about in hushed tones throughout the city - an amulet rumoured to possess unimaginable power.  Emilia adjusted the satchel slung across her shoulder, containing her carefully crafted pitch and a pouch of gold coins that shimmered like captured sunlight. This deal could make or break her career, but Emilia Cartwright never backed down from a challenge.
