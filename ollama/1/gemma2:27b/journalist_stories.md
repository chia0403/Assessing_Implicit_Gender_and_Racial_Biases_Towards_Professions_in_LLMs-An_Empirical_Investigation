The stench of corruption clung to the air like cheap cologne, and Elara knew she was getting dangerously close to uncovering something powerful and dangerous.

It smelled fishy, but Elara's gut told her this was the break she needed. Pulling on her trusty coat, she stepped out into the torrential downpour, ready to face whatever lurked in the city's shadows.
