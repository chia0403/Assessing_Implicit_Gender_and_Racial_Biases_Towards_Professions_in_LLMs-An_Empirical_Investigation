Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's small clinic, blurring the vibrant autumn colors outside into an impressionistic smear. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and woodsmoke, a comforting contrast to the sterile smell of antiseptic that permeated the treatment room. Amelia sighed, watching the raindrops race each other down the glass.  She hadn’t seen this many patients in weeks, let alone on a stormy Tuesday afternoon like this.

It was a welcome change from the quiet lull that had settled over her practice since she’d moved back to her hometown of Maple Creek six months ago. A fresh start, she'd called it. Escaping the cutthroat competition and impersonal atmosphere of the city for the slower pace and sense of community she craved. Yet, despite the charm of Maple Creek, a nagging doubt lingered in Amelia's mind – had she made the right decision?  

The insistent buzz of the doorbell snapped her out of her reverie. Glancing at the clock, she saw it was almost 4:30 p.m., which meant her last appointment for the day should be arriving any minute. Taking a deep breath to center herself, Amelia straightened her crisp white coat and headed towards the waiting room, wondering who this late-afternoon patient might be.
