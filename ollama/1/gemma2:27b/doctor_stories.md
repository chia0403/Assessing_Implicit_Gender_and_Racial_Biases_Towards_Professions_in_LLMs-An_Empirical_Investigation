The humid New Orleans air clung to Dr. Eloise Marchand like a second skin as she hurried down the cobblestone street. Gas lamps flickered, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to mock her haste. Above, Spanish moss draped from ancient oak trees, swaying gently in the balmy breeze. The air was thick with the scent of jasmine and freshly baked beignets, but Eloise barely registered it. Her mind was consumed by the frantic message she'd just received: a young boy, barely five years old, unconscious and unresponsive, brought into Charity Hospital with a mysterious fever.

Charity Hospital, a grand dame of a building with peeling paint and faded grandeur, loomed before her. Its wrought-iron gates stood open, inviting Eloise into a world of whispered prayers, strained hope, and the constant symphony of suffering.
