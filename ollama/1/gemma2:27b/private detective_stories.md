Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Alistair "Al" Finch's office, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of grime and reflection. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and damp wool, punctuated by the occasional cough from Al himself, who was hunched over a stack of faded photographs. Neon signs flickered through the perpetual dusk outside, casting grotesque shadows on the peeling wallpaper. This wasn't the glamorous world of trench coats and dames depicted in the pulpy novels Al devoured as a kid. This was Chicago, 1953, where hope came in cheap whiskey and dreams died under flickering streetlights.


Al sighed, rubbing his bloodshot eyes. The photograph he held depicted a young woman with wide, haunted eyes and hair the color of raven's wings. Her name was Clara Delacroix, and she was missing.  Her brother, a nervous man with trembling hands and a desperate plea in his voice, had offered Al everything he had - a meager sum of fifty dollars - to find her. It wasn't much, but it was enough for Al to take the case, enough to fuel another day chasing shadows in this city of secrets.
