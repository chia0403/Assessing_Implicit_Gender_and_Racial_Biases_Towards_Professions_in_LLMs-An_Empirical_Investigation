Rain lashed against the grimy window of Theodore "Teddy" Albright's office, mimicking the relentless hammering in his head. The flickering neon sign outside read "Albright Insurance: Your Peace of Mind," a cruel joke considering the anxiety gnawing at Teddy's gut. His tiny office, tucked away above a dusty antique shop in the forgotten corner of Elm Street, smelled faintly of mothballs and desperation. Stacks of incomplete claims teetered precariously on his desk, each one a potential lifeline for someone facing disaster, yet also a reminder of the ever-growing mountain of unpaid premiums he owed to the company.

Today, a peculiar case had landed on Teddy's desk, one that promised intrigue and perhaps, just perhaps, a chance to escape the dreary monotony of his existence. A handwritten letter, smelling faintly of lavender and something indefinably ancient, spoke of a lost artifact, a family curse, and an insurance policy unlike any Teddy had ever seen. It was signed simply, "E. Blackwood."
