The aroma of crayons and Elmer's glue hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of disinfectant that perpetually clung to Sunnyside Kindergarten.  Amelia "Amy" Cartwright surveyed her brightly decorated classroom with a sigh.  Sunlight streamed through the oversized windows, illuminating a scene of joyous chaos. Tiny humans, clad in mismatched socks and superhero capes, were scattered across the colorful rug, constructing elaborate towers out of blocks or engrossed in finger-painting masterpieces that looked suspiciously like abstract expressionism. 

But Amy wasn't feeling her usual bubbly kindergarten teacher self today. A knot of anxiety twisted in her stomach, mirroring the tangled mess of yarn on the craft table. It was career day at Sunnyside, and for the first time, Amy dreaded it.
