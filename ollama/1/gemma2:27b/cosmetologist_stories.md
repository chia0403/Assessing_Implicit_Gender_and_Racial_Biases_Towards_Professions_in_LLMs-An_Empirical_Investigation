The humid air hung thick in "Shear Perfection," clinging to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's skin like a second, unwanted layer of hairspray. Outside, New Orleans simmered under a July sun, but inside the salon buzzed with the controlled chaos of snipping shears, whirring dryers, and the rhythmic clatter of nail files against acrylics.  Amelia, her fiery red curls escaping their braid as she leaned over Mrs. LeBlanc's head, sighed. It was 10:30 am, and already she felt like she'd been standing for a decade.

Mrs. LeBlanc, a formidable woman with a bouffant the size of a Mardi Gras float, was adamant about getting her platinum blonde exactly "the same shade as Cher's in 'Moonstruck'" â€“ a request Amelia had heard at least a dozen times that week.  

Today felt different though. A restlessness simmered beneath Amelia's usual calm demeanor, an itch she couldn't quite scratch. It wasn't the heat, or Mrs. LeBlanc's demanding nature, it was something deeper, a whisper of anticipation carried on the humid breeze. Something was about to change, Amelia could feel it in her bones.
