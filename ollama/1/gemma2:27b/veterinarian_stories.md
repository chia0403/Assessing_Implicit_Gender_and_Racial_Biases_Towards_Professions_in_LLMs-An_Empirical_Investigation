Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of The Critter Clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to Amelia Winthrop's frantic heartbeat.  The waiting room was empty, save for a single, forlorn-looking beagle huddled in a corner, his ears drooping like wet dishcloths. Amelia glanced at the clock; 1:32 AM.  A storm this fierce on a Wednesday night could only mean one thing - a desperate owner and an animal needing urgent attention.

Amelia sighed. She'd been up since dawn, dealing with a litter of orphaned kittens and a pug with chronic ear infections. But she couldn't rest knowing an animal was in need. It came with the territory, being the only vet within a hundred miles radius of Willow Creek, Oregon â€“ a tiny town nestled between towering pines and the wild, untamed Pacific Ocean.
