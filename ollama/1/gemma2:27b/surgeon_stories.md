The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Elara Vance, their sterile glow reflecting off the stainless steel instruments laid out with surgical precision. The air in the operating room was thick with anticipation, punctuated by the rhythmic beep of the heart monitor beside her. Outside the large window, dawn was breaking over the city, casting the world in a soft, rose-gold hue. Elara barely noticed. Her focus was entirely on the patient lying open on the table before her - a young man, no older than twenty, his chest rising and falling shallowly with each labored breath. 

Tonight, she wasn't just a surgeon; she was his last hope.
