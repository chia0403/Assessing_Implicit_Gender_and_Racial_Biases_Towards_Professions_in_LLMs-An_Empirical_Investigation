Rain hammered against the windshield, blurring the already faded "For Sale" sign Amelia Cartwright was trying to decipher.  The peeling paint and crooked lettering only added insult to injury on this miserable Tuesday afternoon.  She squinted, counting cars stacked precariously in the overgrown driveway of the rambling Victorian. Five? Six? She hoped the listing photos hadn't been entirely misleading; she pictured a charming fixer-upper, not a vehicular junkyard.

Amelia sighed and wrestled her umbrella free from the passenger seat.  The rusted gate creaked ominously as she pushed it open, the sound echoing eerily through the overgrown garden. This house, tucked away on a forgotten side street in Willow Creek, was giving Amelia bad vibes - and bad vibes rarely meant good commissions. But, desperate times called for desperate measures, and this listing had been languishing for months.  

Taking a deep breath, she navigated the cracked path towards the front door, her sensible heels sinking into the mud. "Just smile and be friendly," she muttered to herself, picturing the bewildered face of the homeowner on the other side. "Maybe they'll offer you tea and biscuits."
