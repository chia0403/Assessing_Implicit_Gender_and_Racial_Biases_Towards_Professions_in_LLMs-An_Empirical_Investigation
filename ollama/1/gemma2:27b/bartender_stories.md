The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked alleyway. "The Rusty Tap," it proclaimed in bold, curling letters, though the 'T' on the end was threatening to go dark entirely. Inside, the air hung heavy with the mingled scents of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and regret.  

Behind the scarred mahogany bar stood Silas Blackwood, his face etched with the weariness that came from years of listening to other people's sorrows. He polished a glass absentmindedly, the rhythmic swish a counterpoint to the mournful blues emanating from the jukebox in the corner. The usual crowd was scattered around the dimly lit booths, their faces shrouded in shadows:  a hulking dockworker nursing a pint of ale, a pair of weary-eyed students huddled over textbooks, and a lone woman dressed in red whose shimmering dress seemed out of place amidst the gloom.

Silas glanced at the clock above the bar. 1:43 AM. Three more hours until closing time, three more hours of dispensing drinks and dispensing advice, both equally potent. He sighed, a wisp of condensation escaping his lips as he braced himself for another long night in The Rusty Tap.
