Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Evelyn Blackwood's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Scattered across her desk were pages smeared with ink and coffee stains – the manuscript for "The Serpent's Kiss," a gothic romance novel that promised more melodrama than substance.  

Evelyn, a woman whose sharp wit was as legendary as her penchant for red lipstick and perfectly tailored suits, sighed. This wasn't the kind of project she dreamt of tackling when she became an editor at Blackwood & Sons Publishing House – a prestigious firm founded by her great-grandfather. She longed to work on thought-provoking literary fiction, not bodice-rippers with titles straight out of a bad romance novel. 

The insistent ringing of the telephone jolted Evelyn back to reality. "Blackwood & Sons," she answered curtly, bracing herself for another round of revisions from the author, who seemed convinced his flowery prose was the next masterpiece.
