This wasn't just a missing person case; it was a puzzle begging to be solved, a truth yearning to be unearthed.

The rhythmic clattering of the old typewriter next door provided a relentless soundtrack to her thoughts, a reminder of deadlines and the constant pressure to unearth the truth. Tonight, she was determined to crack open the mystery surrounding Arthur Vance.
