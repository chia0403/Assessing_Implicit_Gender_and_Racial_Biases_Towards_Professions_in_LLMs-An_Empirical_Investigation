The humid air clung to Amelia "Amy" Santiago like a second skin as she surveyed the field. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the already dusty pitch into a shimmering mirage. A chorus of cicadas buzzed incessantly, punctuated by the distant thud of a basketball bouncing against concrete. Amy shifted her weight, wincing slightly at the twinge in her knee â€“ a reminder of her own glory days as a star striker.

Today, though, she was no longer the one scoring goals. Today, she was Coach Santiago, tasked with whipping this ragtag bunch of teenagers into a semblance of a team.  They stood before her, a motley crew of awkward limbs and forced smiles, looking more like they'd wandered in from gym class than onto a competitive soccer field. Amy sighed inwardly. It wasn't going to be easy.
