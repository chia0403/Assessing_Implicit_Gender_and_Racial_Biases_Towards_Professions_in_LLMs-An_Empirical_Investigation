The scent of sawdust and beeswax hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of saltwater carried on the sea breeze. Elias Finnigan ran a calloused hand over the smooth, mahogany surface of the rocking chair he was crafting. The afternoon sun slanted through the open doorway of his workshop, illuminating the swirling patterns in the wood grain. Outside, gulls shrieked and waves crashed against the rocky cliffs that bordered his small coastal town of Havenwood. Elias paused, listening to the familiar sounds, a sense of contentment settling over him like a warm blanket. He loved the solitude of his work, the rhythm of hammer against wood, the transformation of rough timber into something beautiful and useful. 

But today, a disquiet lingered beneath the surface of his usual calm. A letter lay unopened on his workbench, its crisp white envelope stark against the weathered wooden surface. It bore the seal of the Havenwood Shipping Company – a company Elias had sworn never to deal with again after a bitter dispute years ago.  Yet, here it was, demanding his attention. Elias hesitated, knowing whatever lay within those folds held the potential to disrupt the peaceful life he’d painstakingly built for himself.
