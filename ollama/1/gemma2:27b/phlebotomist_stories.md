The flickering fluorescent light above cast Amelia Rose Cartwright's face in an alternating wash of sickly yellow and pale grey. It was 3:17 am, and the silence of Mercy General Hospital hummed with a quiet tension that only those accustomed to graveyard shifts could truly understand. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and something else, something indefinably metallic – a constant reminder of Amelia's chosen profession.

Amelia, with her hands steady and her eyes sharp despite the hour, navigated the maze-like hallways towards room 212. She clutched a blood vial in one hand, its clear glass reflecting the lonely glow of the hallway lights. A routine blood draw for Mr. Henderson, scheduled for 3:00 am – a seemingly innocuous task, but one that Amelia approached with the same meticulous care she applied to every patient. After all, within those fragile tubes lay not just blood, but stories. Stories of lives lived, battles fought, and futures yet unknown.

Tonight, however, the air felt different. A prickling sensation danced on Amelia's skin, a whisper of unease that tugged at her intuition. The silence seemed heavier, the shadows deeper.  As she approached room 212, the faintest hint of lavender drifted from beneath the door – an odd scent for a hospital room. Curiosity warred with caution in Amelia's mind as she knocked gently on the doorframe.
