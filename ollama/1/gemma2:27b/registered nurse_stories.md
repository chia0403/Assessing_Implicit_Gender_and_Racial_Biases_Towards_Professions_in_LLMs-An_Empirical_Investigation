Rain lashed against the windows of St. Agatha's Hospital, mimicking the hammering anxiety in Amelia Rose Cartwright's chest. The pungent smell of antiseptic mingled with the metallic tang of fear as she hurried down the dimly lit corridor, her white shoes squeaking on the linoleum floor. 

Amelia had been a registered nurse at St. Agatha's for five years, but tonight felt different. Tonight, the usual hum of controlled chaos was replaced by a strained silence, punctuated only by the insistent beeping of monitors and the muffled cries of patients in pain.

She reached Ward C, her destination illuminated by a sickly yellow glow emanating from the hallway lights.  The air inside hung heavy with dread. Nurses huddled together, whispering urgently, their faces etched with worry. In the center of it all lay a figure shrouded in white sheets, a tangle of tubes and wires snaking out from beneath the sterile fabric. 

Amelia swallowed hard, steeling herself for what lay ahead. This wasn't just another night shift. Tonight, she was facing something beyond her usual expertise - something that whispered of ancient secrets and unspeakable horrors.
