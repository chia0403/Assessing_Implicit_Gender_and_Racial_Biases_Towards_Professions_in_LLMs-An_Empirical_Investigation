The humid New Orleans air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and beignets, clinging to Elara Genevieve Dubois like a second skin as she walked down Frenchmen Street. Neon signs buzzed and flickered, casting an otherworldly glow on the bustling crowds spilling out from bars and clubs. The rhythmic pulse of jazz poured from every doorway, a symphony of brass, strings, and drums that vibrated in Elara's chest. 

Tonight was her night. After years of singing in dimly lit cafes and smoky backrooms, she finally had a chance to showcase her talent on the stage of the legendary Spotted Cat Music Club. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic rhythm mirroring the infectious beat of the street.  Elara adjusted the strap of her vintage Gibson guitar, its worn wood familiar and comforting beneath her fingertips. Taking a deep breath, she pushed open the heavy wooden doors of the club, ready to pour her soul into every note.
