The air shimmered above the cracked asphalt runway, distorting the crimson glow of the setting sun. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking the stillness that had settled over Oasis Station. Amelia "Ace" Cartwright adjusted her aviator sunglasses and squinted at the horizon.  Nothing but endless dunes, sculpted by centuries of wind into undulating waves of sand. This desolate outpost on Mars was a far cry from the bustling spaceports she'd flown in and out of back on Earth, but Ace had always been drawn to the edges of civilization, where adventure lurked around every red rock.

Today’s mission: transport a crucial shipment of terraforming catalysts to the Artemis Base, nestled amidst the foothills of Olympus Mons – a three-hour flight through the thin Martian atmosphere. A routine job, except for the unsettling static crackling from her comms unit. Ace tapped it impatiently, trying to clear the interference. Something was off.

The whine of her transport craft's engine echoed across the silent plains, urging her forward. But Ace couldn’t shake the feeling that she was flying into something unknown, something lurking beyond the horizon like a mirage in the Martian dust.
