Rain hammered against the windowpane of Amelia Blackwood's tiny office, mirroring the relentless drumming in her chest. Outside, Edinburgh pulsed with its usual gloomy charm, cobblestones slick with rain reflecting the neon glow of pubs and takeaways. Inside, Amelia stared at the blinking cursor on her computer screen, each tick a mocking reminder of her mounting debt.

She was supposed to be the expert, the one crafting dream vacations for others while navigating the labyrinthine world of travel deals. But her own dreams had crumbled like dry biscuits weeks ago, leaving her with a mountain of unpaid bills and a gnawing sense of failure.  The once vibrant brochures lining her shelves now seemed to mock her, whispering tales of exotic locales she could only imagine visiting.

Today was different, though. Today, Amelia held in her hand an opportunity unlike any other: a cryptic email from a client requesting a "journey into the unknown." The sender's name – Alistair Blackwood – sent a shiver down her spine. Was it a coincidence? Or something more…fateful?
