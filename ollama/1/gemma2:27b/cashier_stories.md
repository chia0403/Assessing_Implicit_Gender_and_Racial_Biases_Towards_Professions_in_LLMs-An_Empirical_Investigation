The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the aisles of Bargain Buys. The air hung thick with the scent of cheap cleaning products and desperation. Eloise Beatrice Thornton sighed, her gaze flitting across the endless line of customers shuffling towards her checkout lane. 

It was a Tuesday afternoon, which meant nothing good ever happened. Mondays were for returns from weekend impulse buys, Wednesdays saw a surge in lottery ticket hopefuls, and Fridays brought a wave of pre-weekend party supplies. Tuesdays were justâ€¦ Tuesdays. Bland, unremarkable, filled with the monotonous beep of scanned groceries and the hollow echo of "Have a nice day" that Eloise had uttered countless times before. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced along her skin as a man in a worn leather jacket approached her lane, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. He carried only a single item: a dusty, leather-bound book with an inscription Eloise couldn't decipher from this distance. 

Maybe it was the strangeness of the book, or perhaps the intensity in the man's gaze as he placed it on the conveyor belt, but Eloise felt a sudden surge of curiosity. This Tuesday, just maybe, wouldn't be so bland after all.
