The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unforgiving glare on the sticky tabletop in front of Eleanor Rose Blackwood. A smear of ketchup clung stubbornly to the edge, mocking her attempts to wipe it clean with a damp rag.  It was Tuesday night at "The Rusty Spigot," a greasy spoon diner nestled in the heart of Oakhaven â€“ a town where dreams went to rust and time seemed to move slower than molasses in January.

Eleanor sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The diner's usual clientele - weary truckers, gossiping retirees, and teenagers with acne and attitude - were thin tonight.  The rhythmic clatter of plates and the sizzle of burgers on the grill usually provided a comforting soundtrack to Eleanor's shift. Tonight, however, an uneasy silence hung in the air, punctuated only by the mournful crooning of a country ballad from the battered jukebox in the corner. 


Eleanor felt it too - a tension she couldn't quite place. It prickled at the back of her neck like a spiderweb brushed against skin. Something was off.
