Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. Tourist groups milled about, their cameras at the ready to capture the majesty of Al-Khazneh, the Treasury, in all its glory. Amidst the chaos, Amira Hassan al-Rashid, a seasoned tour guide with a wealth of knowledge about the history and secrets of Petra, stood confidently at the entrance of the Siq, surveying her group with a warm smile.

Born and raised in Jordan's capital city, Amira had always been fascinated by the ancient Nabataeans who built this magnificent city into the side of a mountain over 2,000 years ago. She had spent countless hours studying the ruins, learning about the intricate water conduit system, the elaborate temple complexes, and the secrets hidden behind the intricately carved facades.

As she led her group through the Siq, Amira couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and ownership over this incredible place. She knew its secrets, its myths, and its legends better than anyone else in Petra. And as they emerged into the spacious court of Al-Khazneh, Amira was ready to share all that knowledge with her eager tourists.

But little did she know, tonight would be different from any other night in Petra's history...
