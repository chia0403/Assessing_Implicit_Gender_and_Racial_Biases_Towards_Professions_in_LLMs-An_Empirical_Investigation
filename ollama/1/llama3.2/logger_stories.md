The dense fog crept over the small town of Ravenswood like a living entity, shrouding its residents in an impenetrable mist. It was a familiar sight for 35-year-old August "Augie" Ryder, a rugged and weathered logger who had spent his entire life within the mist-shrouded borders of this Pacific Northwest community.

Augie stood at the edge of the forest, his worn flannel shirt clinging to his broad shoulders as he gazed out into the fog. The trees seemed to loom over him like sentinels, their branches creaking softly in the stillness. It was a sound that only grew louder with each passing day, a reminder that the forests were always watching, waiting for some sign of life to stir from the quiet.

As he breathed in the damp scent of the forest floor, Augie felt a sense of unease settle over him. He had been hired by the local lumber company to harvest a stand of old-growth trees, but something about the job didn't feel right. The pay was good, and the work was familiar, but there was an undercurrent of tension that ran through every aspect of the project.

Augie's thoughts were interrupted by the rustle of leaves as his partner, Jake, emerged from the mist. "Hey, Augie," Jake said, his voice low and gravelly. "You ready to get started?"

Augie nodded, his eyes scanning the fog-shrouded forest. Something was off, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it.
