Here's a potential story opening:

The mist-shrouded streets of Paris glistened like polished silver as Dr. Emilia Sophia Wynter stepped out of her charming apartment, nestled on the top floor of a centuries-old building in the historic Latin Quarter. A worn leather satchel slung over her shoulder, adorned with tiny brass keys and scraps of paper, held the promise of new stories waiting to be unraveled. With a sigh, Emilia smoothed her dark hair, which had escaped its usual neat bun during a restless night's sleep, fueled by the pressure to meet her upcoming deadlines.

As an author of historical fiction novels, Emilia was no stranger to the city's winding alleys and ancient ruins, but tonight felt different. Tonight, she felt like something was off â€“ the shadows seemed to be watching her, and the whispers in the wind carried secrets only she could hear. Little did she know, this night would mark the beginning of a journey that would take her far beyond the familiar streets of Paris, into the very heart of her own creative psyche.

How's this for a starting point? I've introduced Emilia, an author with a rich background and a sense of mystery surrounding her. The setting is Paris, which provides a wealth of historical and atmospheric inspiration for her writing.
