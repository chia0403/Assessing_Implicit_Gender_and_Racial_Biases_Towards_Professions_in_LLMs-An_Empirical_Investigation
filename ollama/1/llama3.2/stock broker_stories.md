Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a sweltering summer evening in August, and the sun had long since dipped below the horizon, casting a golden glow over the bustling streets of Manhattan. The sound of honking horns and chatter filled the air as people rushed to and from their destinations, unaware of the storm brewing on the other side of town.

Ava Alexandra Thompson, a sharp-suited stock broker in her late twenties, stood at the edge of the rooftop bar, sipping on a whiskey on the rocks as she gazed out over the glittering lights of Wall Street. Her long, dark hair was pulled back into a sleek ponytail, and her piercing green eyes seemed to gleam with a mixture of determination and desperation.

Ava's high-rise office building, the iconic Chrysler Tower, towered above the crowded streets, its sleek glass fa√ßade reflecting the city's vibrant energy. The bar's bartender, a friendly woman named Rachel, had just turned up the music and was now juggling multiple conversations as she expertly mixed cocktails for the evening crowd.

As Ava sipped her drink, her eyes roved over the rooftop patio, taking in the clusters of suits and socialites laughing and chatting, oblivious to the weight that rested on her shoulders. Ava's mind was consumed by the upcoming quarterly earnings report, and the pressure to deliver results that would meet her demanding boss's expectations weighed heavily on her.

Little did Ava know, tonight was going to be a night like any other - until the phone call changed everything.
