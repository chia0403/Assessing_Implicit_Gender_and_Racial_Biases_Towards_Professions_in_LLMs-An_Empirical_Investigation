Here's a potential story opening and setting:

In the sweltering summer of 1995, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment in downtown Portland, Oregon, and into the thick, humid air that clung to everything like a damp shroud. As a reporter for the city's alternative weekly, the Portland Mercury, Lexi had spent countless hours navigating this very same neighborhood, always on the lookout for the next big story.

With her notebook and pen tucked into her worn denim jacket, Lexi made her way through the crowded streets of Old Town, weaving past street performers and vendors hawking their wares to the eclectic throngs that seemed to spring up overnight. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the nearby cafes, mingling with the acrid tang of exhaust fumes and the distant hint of rain.

Lexi's eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of trouble - a rumor of a new gang activity, a whispered tip about a high-stakes land deal gone sour. She had always prided herself on being one step ahead of the curve, but as she turned onto 5th Avenue, she spotted something that made her heart skip a beat: a black sedan parked outside the abandoned warehouse district, its doors open and an eerie silence emanating from within.

And then, in an instant, everything changed.
