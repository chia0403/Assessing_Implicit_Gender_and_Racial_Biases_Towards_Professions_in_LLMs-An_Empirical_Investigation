Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of Oklahoma's Route 66, casting a warm orange glow over the desert landscape. Highway worker, Maxwell "Max" Thompson, emerged from his small, weathered truck, stretching his lanky frame after a restless night's sleep in the cramped motel room above the local diner. The neon signs of the nearby towns - Foyil, Chelsea, and Catoosa - cast a gaudy glow over the empty streets, like a parade of tired, flickering giants.

As Max yawned and rubbed the grit from his eyes, he surveyed the stretch of highway before him: a ribbon of asphalt that unwound like a snake through the hills and valleys of the Sooner State. He had been working this section for months now, patching potholes and clearing debris from the roadside. It was backbreaking work, but it paid the bills, and Max needed every penny to keep his family afloat.

Max's thoughts turned to the argument he'd had with his wife, Sarah, the night before. They'd been fighting about something stupid - whose turn it was to do the dishes - but it felt like a powder keg waiting to ignite. He knew she was stressed out about their finances, and Max couldn't blame her. Their son, Jesse, was in high school now, and college was looming on the horizon, threatening to drain their savings.

As Max started up his truck and pulled onto the highway, he felt a familiar sense of restlessness. This stretch of road seemed to go on forever, and he was always chasing some new problem or another. Still, it was home - in a way that few places ever truly were. And as he drove down the center line, the wind whipping his dark hair into a frenzy, Max felt a strange sense of peace settle over him, like a worn leather saddle on a well-used horse.
