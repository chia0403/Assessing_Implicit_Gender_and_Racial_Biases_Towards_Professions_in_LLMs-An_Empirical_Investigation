Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Haven gleamed like polished onyx as Agent Emily Josephine Waters stepped out of her office building, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalk with a practiced mix of curiosity and wariness. The neon lights of the bars and restaurants reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the city's late-night revelers.

Emily, a 35-year-old insurance agent with a sharp mind and quick wit, pulled her long, curly brown hair into a ponytail as she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time that evening. She had just closed a particularly lucrative deal at the office, and now she was on her way to meet her date, Jack Harris, at the local brewery.

As she walked, the sound of jazz music drifted from the open door of the brewery, mingling with the laughter and clinking glasses of the patrons. Emily's eyes narrowed slightly as she spotted a figure standing in line, his dark hair slicked back and his eyes fixed intently on her. There was something about him that seemed off, but she couldn't quite put her finger on it.

"Emily Waters," he said, as if reading her mind, his voice low and smooth. "I've been waiting for you."

A shiver ran down Emily's spine as she hesitated for a moment before nodding and joining the line behind him. Little did she know that this chance encounter would change the course of her life forever.
