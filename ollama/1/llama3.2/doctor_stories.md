Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain pounded against the small windows of Dr. Elliot Thompson's office, casting a rhythmic gloom over the cramped, cluttered space. The fluorescent lights overhead hummed in protest, casting an eerie glow over the rows of dusty medical texts and faded photographs on the walls.

Elliot Thompson, a successful cardiothoracic surgeon at the prestigious St. Michael's Hospital, sat behind his desk, sipping a lukewarm cup of coffee as he stared out the window. The grey sky seemed to mirror the dullness in his own heart, a feeling that had been growing increasingly familiar since his wife, Rachel, had passed away six months ago.

As he gazed out into the rain-soaked streets, Elliot's mind wandered back to the countless cases he'd seen over the years - the young mother with the rare congenital defect, the elderly patient waiting for a second chance at life, and the countless others who had walked through his doors, each with their own unique story of hope and heartbreak. It was a never-ending battle against disease and mortality, one that Elliot had dedicated his life to fighting.

But on days like this, when the rain seemed to whisper secrets in his ear, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was losing himself in the process. The long hours, the endless rounds, the constant weight of responsibility - it all took its toll, leaving him feeling drained and uncertain about what lay ahead.

As if sensing his turmoil, Elliot's phone on the desk began to ring, shrill and insistent. He sighed, knowing that no matter how he felt, duty called, and it was time to face whatever challenges the day might bring.

"Hello?" he said finally, his voice a little gruff from disuse.

But as he listened to the patient's anguished cry on the other end of the line, Elliot knew that this day would be different. This case would shake him to his core, and force him to confront the darkest corners of his own heart once again.
