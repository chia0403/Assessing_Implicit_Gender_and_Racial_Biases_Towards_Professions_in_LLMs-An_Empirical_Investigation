Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Atticus "Tucky" Thompson stepped out of his office building and onto the sidewalk. A fog rolled in off Puget Sound, shrouding the city in an impenetrable mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp shroud. Tucky lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar pang of nicotine's bitter comfort as he exhaled a plume of smoke into the chill air.

At thirty-five, Tucky had built a reputation as one of Seattle's most tenacious and respected defense attorneys. His clients often found themselves on the wrong side of the law, but with Tucky on their side, they seemed to have a fighting chance against even the most stacked deck of charges. And yet, despite his success, Tucky couldn't shake the feeling that he was stuck in a rut - the same tired cases, the same familiar faces, the same relentless pursuit of justice that had driven him into this profession in the first place.

As he took a long drag on his cigarette, Tucky's thoughts turned to the case that had been plaguing him for weeks now. A high-profile murder trial was about to get underway, and one of Tucky's most high-stakes clients - a young woman accused of murdering her wealthy businessman husband - was counting on him to prove her innocence.

The sound of a car horn pierced the air, making Tucky jump as he gazed up at the darkening sky. His driver, Marcus, had arrived with his sleek black sedan, and Tucky knew that it was time for their morning ritual: a drive through the city's most notorious neighborhoods, in search of clues - or perhaps something more.

"Hey, man," Tucky said, as he slid into the passenger seat, "where's our first stop?"

Marcus just grinned, his eyes glinting behind the wheel. "The part of town where the rain never washes away your sins."
