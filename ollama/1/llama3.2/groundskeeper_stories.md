As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy town of Willow Creek, Emilia Jane Wilson made her way through the overgrown gardens of Ravenswood Manor. The once-grand estate, with its sprawling lawns and meticulously manicured hedges, had been in the Wilson family for generations. But after her grandfather's passing, the manor had fallen into disrepair, its grounds neglected and its beauty slowly being consumed by the passage of time.

Emilia Jane, or Mia as she was known to those who knew her, had grown up amidst the decay and neglect, learning the art of gardening from her father, a skilled horticulturist who had once tended to the manor's gardens with pride. Now, at 25 years old, Mia took on the responsibility of restoring Ravenswood Manor to its former glory, one patch of overgrown grass at a time.

As she worked, the sounds of crickets and rustling leaves accompanied her, punctuated by the occasional bark of the estate's loyal pack of dogs, who patrolled the grounds with an air of vigilance. Mia moved with a quiet efficiency, her hands stained with dirt and her eyes scanning the landscape for any sign of life â€“ or death. The task ahead of her was daunting, but she was determined to revive Ravenswood Manor, and in doing so, restore a piece of her family's history to its former splendor.
