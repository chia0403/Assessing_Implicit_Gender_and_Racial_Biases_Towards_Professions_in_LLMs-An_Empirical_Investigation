Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished stone as Jack Edward Harrison, a grizzled plumber with 20 years of experience, trudged through the downpour to his truck. The neon signs of the city's bars and restaurants reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the drizzly evening. Jack's eyes scanned the deserted streets, his mind already focused on the leaky faucet that had brought him to this part of town. He pulled out his phone to check the address: 1425 Oak Street - just a few blocks from the waterfront.

As he climbed into his truck, the interior enveloped him in a warm cocoon of diesel fuel and worn leather. Jack adjusted his baseball cap and lit a cigarette, taking a long drag before killing the engine. He peered out at the rain-soaked darkness, feeling the weight of another day's work ahead of him.

This setting establishes the protagonist, Jack Edward Harrison, as a working-class plumber in Seattle, with a sense of routine and familiarity to the city's streets. The rainy evening atmosphere sets a somber tone for the story to come.
