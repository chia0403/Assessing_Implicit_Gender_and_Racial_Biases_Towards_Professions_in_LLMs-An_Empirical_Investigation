Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emilia "Mia" Thompson stood at the edge of her office window, gazing out over the fog-shrouded campus of Ravenswood University, where she had spent the better part of two decades teaching literature to students who were both fascinated and intimidated by the works of the greats. As a professor of English, Mia had built a reputation for being one of the most insightful and incisive scholars in her field, known for her ability to coax even the most opaque texts into revealing their hidden depths.

As she stood there, lost in thought, the mist swirling around the ancient stone buildings like a living entity, Mia's mind kept drifting back to the strange letter that had arrived at her office earlier that week. It was an anonymous missive, penned on a single sheet of paper with no signature or indication of who might have sent it. The words themselves were enigmatic: "The truth about Edgar Allan Poe lies not in his stories, but in the shadows that follow him home."

Mia's curiosity was piqued, and she couldn't shake the feeling that this letter was more than just a prank - it was a challenge, or perhaps even a warning. She felt a shiver run down her spine as she turned away from the window and began to pace across her office, her mind racing with possibilities. What secrets lay hidden in the darkness of Poe's world? And what did they have to do with Ravenswood University?
