As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes, 22-year-old Alexis Rose Thompson made her way through the door of Oakdale Daycare Center. The air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and fresh paint, a testament to the renovation that had been underway for weeks.

Alexis, with her bright pink hair tied back in a ponytail and a sprinkle of freckles across her cheeks, exchanged pleasantries with the other staff members as they began their evening routine. She had worked at Oakdale Daycare Center for three years, starting as a part-time helper and working her way up to lead caregiver.

The daycare was nestled in a cozy corner of Willow Creek, surrounded by a handful of houses that seemed frozen in time. The building itself had seen better days, but a recent influx of grants and donations from the local community had transformed it into a vibrant hub of activity.

As Alexis began to sort through the day's laundry and prep for the evening's snack-time, her thoughts turned to the upcoming Staff Appreciation Night, being held at the Willow Creek Community Center. The event promised to be a fun night out for the staff, complete with pizza, karaoke, and a photo booth.

Little did Alexis know, this night would prove to be the catalyst for a chain of events that would shake the very foundations of Oakdale Daycare Center.
