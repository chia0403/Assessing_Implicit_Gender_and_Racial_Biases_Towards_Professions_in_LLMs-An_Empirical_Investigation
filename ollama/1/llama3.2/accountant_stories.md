Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in October when Emily Jane Wilson trudged through the rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle, her bright yellow umbrella a stark contrast to the gloomy sky above. As an accountant at a small firm specializing in non-profit organizations, Emily had spent most of her career surrounded by spreadsheets and financial reports, but tonight she was on a mission to investigate a mysterious discrepancy in one of their largest clients' accounts.

Emily pushed open the door to the coffee shop where she knew her source would be waiting - Jack Harris, a former employee of the non-profit who had left under acrimonious circumstances six months prior. As she took a seat at the counter, ordering a lukewarm latte and scanning the crowded room for a glimpse of Jack's familiar scruffy beard and worn denim jacket.

The coffee shop was a cozy hub of activity on this chilly evening, with students huddled over laptops and businessmen typing away on their phones. But Emily wasn't here to people-watch; she had a job to do, and that meant getting down to business with the man who might hold the key to unlocking the secrets behind the missing funds.

As she waited for Jack to arrive, Emily's mind whirled with possibilities - was this a case of embezzlement, or something more sinister? And what did Jack know about it all? Only time would tell.
