Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The stormy night air clung to the small coastal town like a damp shroud, casting a gloomy veil over the deserted streets of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea. The waves crashed against the rocky shoreline, sending spray high into the darkness as if trying to wash away the secrets that lurked within the crumbling Victorian mansions that lined the waterfront.

In her small cottage above the local surf shop, Emily May Wilson stirred in bed, her ears still ringing with the sound of sirens and the distant howl of the wind. As a registered nurse at Ravenswood General Hospital, Emily was no stranger to the call of duty, but tonight felt different. Tonight, she had received a mysterious phone call from an unknown number, beckoning her to a secluded spot on the coast where a patient was waiting - one who required her attention with haste.

Emily's thoughts swirled as she threw off the covers and swung her legs over the side of the bed, planting her feet firmly on the cool wooden floorboards. She had always loved Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, but tonight it felt like a place shrouded in mystery, where the line between reality and myth blurred like the waves on the shore.

She stood up, her long blonde hair spilling down her back like a golden waterfall as she began to get dressed, ready to face whatever lay ahead. Little did she know, this stormy night was about to unleash a chain of events that would change her life forever.
