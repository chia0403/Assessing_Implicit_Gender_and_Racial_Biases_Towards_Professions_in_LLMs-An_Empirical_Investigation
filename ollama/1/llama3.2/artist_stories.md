Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit studio was a sanctuary for Ember Rose Wynter, an artist known for her vivid and emotive paintings that seemed to capture the very essence of her subjects' souls. Nestled in the heart of Portland's Arts District, the studio was a cozy haven filled with half-finished canvases, jars of paint-splattered rags, and the faint scent of turpentine.

The sun had set hours ago, casting a golden glow over the city's bustling streets as they gradually emptied out for the night.
