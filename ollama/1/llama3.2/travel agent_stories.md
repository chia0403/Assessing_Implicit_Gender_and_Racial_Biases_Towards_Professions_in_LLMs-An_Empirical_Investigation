Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Opening:

"As she poured herself a cup of coffee, Emily Jane Thompson gazed out the rain-soaked window of her small office, feeling like the world was moving on without her. Another week had slipped by, and yet another couple had come to her with their dream wedding plans only to have them crushed by reality. The latest would-be bride-to-be, a socialite with a penchant for designer labels, had just stormed out of Emily's office, leaving behind a trail of tears and broken dreams.

Emily sighed, rubbing the fatigue from her eyes. She had always loved planning weddings – there was something so beautiful about bringing two people together in front of their friends and family. But lately, it seemed like every couple she worked with was more concerned with finding the perfect Instagram-perfect wedding than with actually building a life together.

Setting:

The story takes place in Portland, Oregon, a city known for its quirky vibe and outdoor enthusiasts. Emily's office is located in the Pearl District, a trendy neighborhood filled with upscale boutiques and restaurants. The sound of rain pattering against the window was just one of many signs that the stormy weather had settled over the city.

As she sipped her coffee, Emily's gaze wandered around the small office, taking in the rows of travel brochures and wedding planning guides on the shelves. There were also a few framed photos – pictures of her own travels to far-flung destinations like Bora Bora and New Zealand. These memories brought a smile to her face, reminding her why she became a travel agent in the first place: to explore the world and share that sense of wonder with others.

But for now, Emily was stuck in Portland, feeling restless and unsure of what the future held. She had always dreamed of traveling more – of visiting places like Japan or India, of experiencing different cultures and meeting new people. But as a travel agent, she felt like she was stuck in a rut, planning the same old weddings over and over again."
