The sun was just starting to rise over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy streets and homes. In a quiet corner of the neighborhood, where the pavement cracked and the grass grew tall, 35-year-old Julian Alexander "Jules" Thompson stretched his arms and arched his back, giving a good yawn to signal the start of another day on the job.

As a landscaper, Jules had spent countless mornings like this, tackling the weeds and debris that seemed to sprout up overnight in every garden, yard, and park in town. He worked for his father's small business, Thompson's Turf Care, which had been serving Willow Creek for decades. With a keen eye for detail and a love of getting his hands dirty, Jules took pride in transforming neglected outdoor spaces into beautiful oases that made people want to linger outside.

Today was no exception. A call from the town council had summoned him to Oakwood Park, where the annual Blooming Beauty contest was about to take place. The park's gardens were already looking a bit worse for wear, and Jules suspected he'd have his work cut out for him. As he loaded up his truck with loppers, rakes, and other essentials, he couldn't help but wonder what other surprises the day might hold.
