The fog rolled in off the canal, shrouding the narrow streets of Coventry in a damp, grey mist. It was a chilly autumn morning in 1888, and the streets were already bustling with the sound of hammering and chiseling as the city's skilled craftsmen set to work on the day's tasks.

His name was Edwin Fletcher Wychwood, a 25-year-old draughtsman with a passion for precision and a talent for bringing his clients' most ambitious designs to life.

Edwin's dark hair was mussed from a restless night's sleep, and his eyes were bloodshot from too much reading and not enough coffee.
