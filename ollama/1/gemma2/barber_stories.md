The rusty bell above the door jingled a discordant welcome as Elias "Eli" Blackwood surveyed the barbershop. A thin veil of cigarette smoke hung in the air, mingling with the scent of bay rum and leather. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. Eli ran a hand over the worn mahogany counter, its surface smooth from years of manicured hands and countless cups of lukewarm coffee.

The barbershop, nestled on a forgotten side street in Jackson Heights, was a relic of a bygone era. It held onto the faded grandeur of a time when men would spend hours discussing politics, sports, and the affairs of their lives over the whirring of clippers and the snip of scissors. These days, though, Eli mostly dealt with the quiet anxieties of lonely retirees, nervous college students, and the occasional lost soul seeking solace in a simple haircut.


The worn barber chair, upholstered in faded red vinyl, creaked gently as Eli sat down, his gaze fixed on the street outside. The usual trickle of afternoon traffic had slowed to a crawl. A sense of unease settled over him, a feeling that something was about to change.
