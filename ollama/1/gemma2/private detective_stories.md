Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Samuel "Sam" Blackwood's office, blurring the neon glow of the 'Open 24 Hours' sign across the street. A shiver ran down Sam's spine, not from the cold seeping through the drafty windowpanes, but from the weight of the file in his hand. The faded photograph showed a young woman with haunting blue eyes and a smile that seemed frozen in time.  

The name "Eleanor Vance" was scrawled across the top in clumsy handwriting. Her disappearance had been classified as 'missing person' by the police, but the desperation in the handwritten note accompanying the photo suggested something more sinister. Sam's office wasn't located in the glamorous heart of the city; it was tucked away in a forgotten corner of Southside, where flickering streetlights cast long shadows and whispers travelled faster than cars.  

He leaned back in his creaky chair, its springs groaning under his weight, and gazed out at the rain-soaked cityscape. It was the kind of night that swallowed secrets whole, and Sam Blackwood was about to wade into one.
