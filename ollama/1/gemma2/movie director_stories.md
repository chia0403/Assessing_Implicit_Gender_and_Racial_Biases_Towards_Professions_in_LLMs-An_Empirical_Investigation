The humid July air hung thick over New Orleans, clinging to Amelia Rose Dubois like a second skin as she surveyed the decaying grandeur of the old theatre. Its faded marquee, once proclaiming blockbusters in neon glory, now sported a single flickering bulb reading "Coming Soon." It was more a threat than a promise. 

Amelia, with her unruly auburn curls escaping their bun and a smudge of coffee on her crisp white shirt, wasn't easily deterred. This dilapidated Art Deco masterpiece, the last standing testament to New Orleans' golden cinematic age, was her dream project: a gritty neo-noir thriller set amidst the city’s simmering jazz scene. She envisioned it as a love letter to classic film noir, infused with the vibrant energy of the Big Easy.  

The theatre, however, was a far cry from glamorous Hollywood sets. The air was thick with dust and the scent of damp wood. Cobwebs draped the velvet seats like ghostly shrouds, and the stage floor creaked ominously under her weight. Despite its decrepitude, Amelia could see the potential. It held the ghosts of forgotten stories, whispered echoes of applause and laughter, waiting to be resurrected on screen. 


This was where she would make her mark, where she’d prove that even in this crumbling relic, magic still existed.
