The scent of caramelized sugar and warm yeast hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eloise Amelia Cartwright like a second skin. Her tiny bakery, "Crumbs & Comfort," nestled between a laundromat and a florist on Elm Street, was her haven. The mismatched tables were scrubbed clean each morning, sunlight streaming through the dusty windows onto rows of freshly baked goods: crusty sourdough loaves with glistening cracks, buttery croissants flaking at the edges, and blueberry muffins plump with sweet bursts of fruit. 

Eloise hummed along to the old radio playing in the corner, carefully piping rosettes onto a vanilla bean cake destined for Mrs. Henderson's granddaughter's birthday party. Outside, the bustling city was just beginning to stir, but here, in her little world of flour and sugar, time moved at a slower, more deliberate pace.
