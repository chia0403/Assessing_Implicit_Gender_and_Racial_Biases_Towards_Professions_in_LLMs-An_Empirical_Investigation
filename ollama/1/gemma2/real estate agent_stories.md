The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia Grace Hawthorne like a damp towel as she surveyed the property. Spanish moss draped the ancient oaks lining the driveway, their gnarled branches whispering secrets in the gentle breeze. Sunlight dappled through the leaves, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air. A rusted swing set stood sentinel at the edge of the overgrown lawn, a silent testament to happier times. 

Amelia sighed. This Victorian manor, perched on a hill overlooking Savannah's historic district, was a fixer-upper of epic proportions. Its faded grandeur hinted at its former glory, but years of neglect had taken their toll. Still, Amelia saw potential. She could envision the home restored to its former splendor, filled with laughter and light once again. 

She adjusted her signature wide-brimmed hat and straightened the crisp white collar of her blouse. It was going to be a long day convincing anyone that this diamond in the rough wasn't a lost cause.
