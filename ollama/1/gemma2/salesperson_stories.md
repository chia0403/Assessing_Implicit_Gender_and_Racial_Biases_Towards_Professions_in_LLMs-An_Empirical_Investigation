The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Beatrice Harper’s meticulously arranged desk.  Amelia, her perfectly coiffed blonde bob reflecting the harsh light, tapped a manicured nail against the edge of her smartphone. The showroom floor was bustling with customers, their voices a dull roar competing with the piped-in elevator music that promised something upbeat but delivered only a tinny, melancholic melody. 

Outside, the Miami sun beat down on the glass facade of the high-rise building, blurring the cityscape into shimmering heatwaves. It was the kind of day that made Amelia’s stilettos feel like lead weights and her tailored suit stick uncomfortably to her skin. But she couldn't afford to complain.  The quota for this month hung over her head like a storm cloud, and with each passing hour, it seemed to grow darker. 


Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the next round of sales pitches. She was good at what she did, that much was certain. But lately, even her silver tongue felt coated in sand, unable to smooth over the ever-present sense of unease that clung to the air in this once vibrant showroom.  There was a feeling in the building – a collective sigh, a whispered fear – that something was about to change. And Amelia, for all her practiced optimism, couldn't shake the feeling that it wouldn’t be good.
