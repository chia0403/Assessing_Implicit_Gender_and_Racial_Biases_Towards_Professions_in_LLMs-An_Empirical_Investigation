The humid Miami air hung heavy, thick with the scent of saltwater and exhaust fumes.  Rain slicked the pavement, turning Biscayne Boulevard into a swirling river of neon reflections. Inside Ambulance 21, paramedic Isabella Reyes checked her equipment – oxygen mask, gauze pads, IV kit - all laid out like soldiers awaiting battle. Her partner, rookie EMT Marco Diaz, nervously bounced his knee against the seat, whistling an off-key tune under his breath. The constant hum of the engine and the flashing red lights filled the space between them.

"First call with rain," Isabella said, her voice calm despite the adrenaline buzzing beneath her skin. She pulled out her headset, flicking it to receive. "Ambulance 21, ready for dispatch."


The crackle of static followed by a panicked dispatcher’s voice jolted Isabella back to reality. “21, we have a possible drowning at South Pointe Park. Victim is unresponsive, reports of a young boy caught in the current.”

Isabella felt Marco stiffen beside her. This was it.
