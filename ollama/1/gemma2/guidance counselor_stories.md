The fluorescent lights hummed above Esther Penelope Albright's head like a swarm of anxious bees. She tapped her pen against the worn oak desk, watching the minutes tick by on the digital clock. Her office, nestled in a corner of the bustling Willow Creek High School, felt smaller than usual today, its floral wallpaper and motivational posters offering little comfort. It wasn't just the impending parent-teacher night that weighed on her, though that was always a nerve-wracking affair. No, it was something else, a prickling unease that seemed to emanate from the very walls themselves. 


Willow Creek High was known for its idyllic facade â€“ rolling green lawns, friendly teachers, and a reputation for academic excellence. But beneath the surface, Esther knew things weren't always as they seemed.  The town itself felt different lately, hushed and watchful, like secrets were being whispered on the wind. And she couldn't shake the feeling that those secrets might be spilling into her office, one anxious student at a time.
