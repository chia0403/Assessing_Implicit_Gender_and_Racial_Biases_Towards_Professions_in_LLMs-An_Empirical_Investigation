The air in Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s studio was thick with the smell of linseed oil and regret.  Sunlight slanted through the dusty skylight, illuminating the scattered palette knives and half-finished canvases that littered her work surface like fallen soldiers. She stared at the latest casualty – a vibrant seascape, once brimming with life, now marred by clumsy brushstrokes and muddy hues. The sun, intended to blaze gold against the cerulean waves, now resembled a sickly bruise, while the boats, meant to dance in the azure breeze, looked more like drunken sailors clinging desperately to their masts.

Amelia's studio was nestled above her grandfather’s antique shop on a cobbled street in the historic heart of Edinburgh. Its window, perpetually open to catch the scent of rain-washed stone and distant sea spray, offered a breathtaking panorama of rooftops stretching towards the imposing silhouette of Arthur’s Seat. Outside, life buzzed with a rhythm Amelia had always found comforting – the clatter of trams, the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith's hammer, the muffled chatter spilling from cafes and pubs. Yet inside her studio, a storm raged within her own soul.  The inspiration she once felt so readily, like a current surging through her veins, seemed to have vanished, leaving behind an emptiness that echoed the dull ache in her chest.
