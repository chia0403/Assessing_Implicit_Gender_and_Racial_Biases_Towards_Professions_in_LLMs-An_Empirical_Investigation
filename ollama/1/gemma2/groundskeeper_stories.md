The dew clung to Amelia Evergreen’s boots like miniature diamonds as she pushed her mower across the emerald expanse of Meadowbrook Cemetery.  Sunlight, filtered through the ancient oaks lining the paths, cast dappled shadows that danced with each revolution of the blades. The air hummed with the drone of cicadas and the distant chirping of sparrows weaving between marble angels and weathered tombstones. Amelia, a woman as sturdy and unyielding as the oak she often sought shade under, inhaled deeply, savoring the scent of damp earth and honeysuckle that permeated the quiet graveyard.

It was her sanctuary, this sprawling tapestry of remembrance. Here, amidst the whispers of forgotten stories etched in stone and bronze, Amelia found solace and purpose.  She knew every curve of the paths, every inscription on the headstones, every secret nook where a lone sparrow might build its nest. This wasn't just her job, it was a living history lesson, a constant reminder of life’s fleeting beauty and enduring impact. 


Today, however, an unfamiliar tension crackled in the air, disrupting the usual rhythm of peace.  Amelia felt it first as a prickle on the back of her neck, then saw it reflected in the worried gaze of Mrs. Hawthorne, who was tending to her late husband's grave. Whatever disturbance lay ahead, Amelia knew she would face it with the same quiet strength she brought to her daily duties, for Meadowbrook Cemetery held more secrets than just those whispered by the wind.
