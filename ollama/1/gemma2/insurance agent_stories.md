The humid Florida air clung to Amelia "Amy" Brighton like a second skin as she stepped out of her beat-up Honda Civic. Cicadas droned their incessant symphony from the towering oak trees lining Magnolia Drive, their buzzing amplified by the oppressive stillness. The July heat shimmered off the asphalt, blurring the edges of Mrs. Peterson's quaint bungalow where Amy was about to meet her new client.

Amy straightened her navy blue blazer, adjusting the name tag pinned proudly over her crisp white blouse. It read "Amelia Brighton, Insurance Solutions."  Her smile felt strained, a testament to the string of canceled appointments and lukewarm leads that had plagued her since starting her own agency just six months ago. Mrs. Peterson, with her reputation for being a bit eccentric, was her last hope for a decent lead this week. 


Taking a deep breath, Amy pushed open the screen door and stepped into the cool, dimly lit interior, hoping to find more than just a stale cup of coffee and the usual small-town gossip waiting for her.
