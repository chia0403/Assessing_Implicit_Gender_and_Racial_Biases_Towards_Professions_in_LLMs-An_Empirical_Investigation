The late August air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain as Elara James-Reed navigated the bustling triage area. Her stethoscope swung rhythmically against her chest, keeping time with the anxious murmur that always seemed to permeate Mercy General Hospital’s ER on a Friday night. A cacophony of sirens wailed in the distance, a reminder that this small coastal town was just a blip on the map for anyone needing more specialized care. Elara, however, found solace in its familiar chaos. 

The worn linoleum floor felt cool beneath her sneakers, and the fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the scene before her. A young boy sobbed uncontrollably beside his mother, clutching at his scraped knee while a harried nurse tried to calm him. In the corner, a burly man with a bandage wrapped around his head groused about being bitten by a dog – again.  Elara took a deep breath, smoothing down her scrubs as she surveyed the scene. This was her domain, a place where lives were often on the line and ordinary people found extraordinary strength in their vulnerability. It wasn't glamorous, but Elara wouldn't trade it for anything.
