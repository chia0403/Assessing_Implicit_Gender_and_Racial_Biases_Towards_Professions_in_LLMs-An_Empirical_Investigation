The fluorescent lights hummed above Eliza Beatrice Hawthorne, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of "Bargain Bin Bonanza."  She tapped her acrylic nails against the register's surface, counting the seconds until her shift ended. Five minutes left. Five minutes until she could escape this purgatory of crumpled discount clothes and expired food coupons.

Eliza glanced at the woman before her, meticulously sorting through a pile of mismatched socks with an intensity usually reserved for neurosurgeons performing open heart surgery. The woman muttered to herself about thread count and arch support, oblivious to Elizaâ€™s yearning for freedom. 

Outside, the late summer sun was beginning to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in bruised purples and oranges. A lone hawk circled lazily overhead, its shadow gliding across the cracked asphalt parking lot like a phantom.  Eliza imagined herself soaring above it all, free from the drudgery of counting pennies and scanning barcodes. 


Instead, she was stuck, a pawn in the endless game of retail purgatory, waiting for the clock to strike five.
