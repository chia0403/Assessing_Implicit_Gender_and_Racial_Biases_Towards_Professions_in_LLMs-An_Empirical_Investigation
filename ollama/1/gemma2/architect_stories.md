The harsh desert sun beat down on Amelia Beatrice Thorne's back as she surveyed the half-constructed building. It was a behemoth of steel and glass, jutting out from the otherwise barren landscape like a metallic cactus. The air shimmered with heat, distorting the horizon where the sand dunes met the impossibly blue sky.  

Amelia ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, pushing it back from her face as she squinted at the blueprints clutched in her other hand. This project, the Grand Oasis Resort, was her magnum opus - a testament to sustainable architecture and human ingenuity in the heart of the unforgiving Sahara. But as she gazed upon the skeletal structure, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. 


The wind whipped around her, carrying with it whispers of sand and the distant groan of construction machinery. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic hammering echoing from within the building, a relentless pulse that mirrored the growing unease in Amelia's chest. This wasn’t just about aesthetics or practicality anymore; this project felt imbued with something… more.
