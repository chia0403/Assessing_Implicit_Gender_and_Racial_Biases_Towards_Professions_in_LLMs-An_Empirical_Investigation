The flickering neon sign cast a lurid pink glow on Amelia Rose Blackwoodâ€™s face as she adjusted the microphone stand. The air inside The Dusty Note was thick with cigarette smoke and cheap beer, punctuated by the sporadic bursts of laughter from a table in the corner.  Amelia, bathed in the ethereal light spilling from the stage spotlight, took a deep breath, her heart drumming against her ribs like a caged bird. This wasn't the grand concert hall she'd dreamed of, not even close. But it was a stage, and that was all that mattered tonight.  Tonight, Amelia Rose Blackwood was going to sing her heart out, hoping to snag the attention of someone, anyone, who could help her escape this dusty bar and chase the impossible dream of stardom. 


The Dusty Note was a dive bar on the edge of a forgotten town in Nevada, its faded glory clinging to the peeling paint and cracked leather booths. It was the kind of place where regulars knew their drinks by name, secrets were shared over shots, and dreams went to die.
