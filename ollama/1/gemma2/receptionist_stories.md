The bell above the shop door chimed mournfully as Amelia Beatrice Worthington glanced up from her meticulously organized stack of appointment cards. It was 3:17 pm on a Tuesday, which usually meant a lull in business at "Lavender and Lace," a quaint flower shop nestled on a quiet cobblestone street in Bath. But today felt different. A chill hung in the air, heavier than the autumnal breeze swirling outside. Amelia shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around her slender frame. The usual comforting aroma of lilies and roses was overpowered by a strange metallic scent, like old coins and rain.  

She peered out the window, expecting to see a storm brewing, but the sky was clear, a vibrant blue canvas dotted with fluffy white clouds. Her gaze lingered on the empty street, an unsettling stillness settling over the usually bustling neighborhood. Amelia felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine. Something wasn't right.
