The stench hit Elias Montgomery before he even reached the front door. A wave of sewage, rotten eggs, and despair rolled over him like a physical force. It was always worse with old Victorian houses – the intricate plumbing systems were marvels of engineering, but also prime breeding grounds for bacterial nightmares.  

Elias tugged his thick canvas apron tighter around his waist, shielding himself from the worst of it as he ascended the crumbling porch steps. The house itself hunched on the street like a weary giant, its gingerbread trim peeling and faded, the windows boarded shut save for one flickering yellow light in the attic. 

He was alone at the end of the cobbled street, the rest of Maplewood’s residents safely tucked away inside their modern homes, oblivious to the miasma emanating from this crumbling relic. Elias sighed, ran a hand through his grease-stained hair, and knocked on the warped wooden door. 


The setting is  a decaying Victorian neighborhood in a small town called Maplewood. It's late afternoon, with long shadows stretching across the cracked pavement and the air thick with the smell of decay. The house itself is grand but neglected, its beauty marred by time and neglect. There’s an eerie stillness to the place, broken only by the creak of the swing set in the overgrown front yard and the distant rumble of a passing car.
