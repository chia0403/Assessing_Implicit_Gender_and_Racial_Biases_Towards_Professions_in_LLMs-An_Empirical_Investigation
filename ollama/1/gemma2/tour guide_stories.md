The humid air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and exhaust fumes as Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick adjusted her straw hat and smiled brightly at her group. "Welcome, everyone, to the vibrant heart of Old Marrakesh! I'm Amelia, your guide for this whirlwind tour through the labyrinthine alleys and bustling souks."

Amelia gestured towards the riotous colours that surrounded them - scarlet silk draped over stalls overflowing with spices, shimmering mosaics glinting in the morning sun, and men hawking their wares in booming voices. Above it all, pigeons flitted between intricately carved balconies, adding a touch of avian chaos to the already frenetic scene.

The tour group, a motley crew of eager tourists armed with cameras and guidebooks, looked back at Amelia with wide eyes, clearly mesmerized by the sensory overload before them. 


She grinned, feeling a familiar thrill course through her. This was what she loved - sharing this vibrant city with others, unveiling its hidden secrets and translating its chaotic energy into captivating stories. But today, Amelia had a feeling things were about to get much more interesting than usual. A shiver ran down her spine as she noticed a pair of eyes watching them from the shadows of a nearby archway, their gaze sharp and unsettling.
