The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of disinfectant cleaner.  Sunlight streamed through the windows of Mrs. Amelia Willowbrookâ€™s kindergarten classroom, illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden beams. Outside, children shrieked and laughed on the playground, their voices muffled by the double-paned glass. Inside, a carefully curated chaos reigned.  Crayons lay scattered across tables like fallen soldiers, construction paper crumbled in colorful heaps, and a half-finished macaroni art project sat precariously balanced on a shelf. 

Amelia, her hair pulled back in a messy bun and a bright yellow cardigan stretched tight over her expanding belly, surveyed the scene with weary amusement. The morning had been... eventful. A rogue glue stick had found its way onto the carpet, resulting in an impromptu art project involving the classroom rug and a particularly enthusiastic boy named Timmy. Then there was the glitter explosion during the craft session, leaving a sparkling residue on everything from Amelia's hair to the ceiling fan.  

This wasn't exactly how she imagined her pregnancy leave preparation going.
