The greasy spoon diner reeked of burnt coffee and despair, a scent familiar to Clayton "Clay"  Hendrickson III as he slid onto the worn vinyl stool. He wiped his calloused hands on his faded denim jacket, the one with the embroidered phoenix rising from flames – a memento from a bad breakup that had left him with more miles than meaning. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping snow into frenzied dances across the desolate highway stretching before him. 

This stretch of Route 66 was known as "The Devil's Spine," notorious for its unforgiving winter storms and lonely stretches where the only company you kept was your own thoughts. Clay preferred the quiet. It allowed him to drown in his whiskey-soaked memories, a past he tried desperately to outrun with each mile ticked off on his rig's odometer. Tonight, though, even the silence felt oppressive. A cold, unsettling feeling settled in his gut, a premonition that this journey wouldn’t be like any other.  


The flickering neon sign outside buzzed ominously, casting long, distorted shadows across Clay's weary face as he stared into his lukewarm coffee, willing the warmth to chase away the growing chill within him.
