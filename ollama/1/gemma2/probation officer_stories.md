The flickering neon sign outside "Lucky's Liquor" cast a sickly green glow on Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewood's sensible shoes as she approached the building. Rain slicked the pavement, reflecting the distorted light like shattered mirrors. 

Eleanor hated nights like this â€“ cold, damp, and smelling faintly of cheap whiskey and desperation.  Tonight was even worse than usual. It was her first solo probation check on a newly released arsonist, Jeremiah "Sparks" Caldwell. Sparks had a penchant for setting things alight, a habit Eleanor hoped he'd left behind in prison. 

She adjusted the heavy weight of her purse, where she kept pepper spray and a battered copy of the probation handbook tucked inside. It was hardly enough to protect her from a guy like Sparks, but it was better than nothing. The thought of facing him alone, in this dimly lit alleyway, sent a shiver down Eleanor's spine. She took a deep breath, straightened her blazer, and marched towards the door, steeling herself for whatever awaited inside.
