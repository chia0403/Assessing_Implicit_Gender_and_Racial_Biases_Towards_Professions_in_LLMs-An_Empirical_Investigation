The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and spilled beer, a familiar aroma that clung to Amelia "Amy" Sinclair like a second skin. The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting the faded red interior of "The Rusty Anchor" in a pulsating light show. It was almost closing time on a Tuesday night in Galveston, Texas, and the usual crowd had thinned out: a handful of salty fishermen nursing their last beers, a couple whispering secrets in the dim corner booth, and a lone biker counting his change with weary eyes. Amy leaned against the bar, wiping down the polished mahogany surface with a rag, her gaze sweeping over the remaining patrons. She knew each one by name, their stories etched into her memory like constellations in the night sky. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. A woman stepped inside, her silhouette framed against the streetlight glow. Amy watched, intrigued. The newcomer was shrouded in shadow, but she radiated an air of mystery that pulled Amy's attention like a moth to a flame.
