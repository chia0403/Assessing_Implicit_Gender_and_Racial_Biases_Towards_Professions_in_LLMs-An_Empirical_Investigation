The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Blackwood's latest project: a sprawling Victorian garden choked with overgrown ivy and tangled rose bushes. Her calloused hands, stained green from a day spent wrestling unruly weeds, clutched a pair of rusty pruning shears as she surveyed the chaotic scene. 

Amelia wasn't just any landscaper; she was known in her small town of Maple Creek for breathing life back into forgotten gardens. With a keen eye for detail and an innate understanding of plants, she could coax beauty from even the most neglected plots. But this garden, with its crumbling stone fountain and wilting wisteria, presented a unique challenge. A sense of sadness hung heavy in the air, as if the garden itself was mourning a lost era. 


Amelia took a deep breath, filling her lungs with the scent of damp earth and fading summer blooms. The air thrummed with the drone of cicadas, a symphony echoing the bittersweet melody of endings and new beginnings.  She knew this garden held secrets, whispered tales beneath the rustling leaves. It was time to listen.
