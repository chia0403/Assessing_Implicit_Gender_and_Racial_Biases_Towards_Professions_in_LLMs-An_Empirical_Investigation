The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head like a chorus of anxious bees. She gripped the metal handle of the dental scaler, its cool weight grounding her in the familiar chaos of Dr. Patel’s bustling practice. The scent of antiseptic and peppermint hung thick in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic whirring of drills and the occasional choked gag from a patient grappling with their fear. Amelia preferred this symphony of dentistry to any other. 

Her small office was tucked away in the corner, its walls adorned with posters promoting dental hygiene that had become faded and slightly dog-eared over the years. A single window looked out onto a street perpetually shrouded in the gray haze of a perpetual Seattle drizzle, offering a melancholic backdrop to her daily routine.  This morning, however, Amelia wasn't focused on the dreary vista or the familiar anxieties of her patients. Her gaze was fixed on a peculiar package sitting on her desk – a brown envelope with an unfamiliar return address and a single crimson wax seal emblazoned with a raven. It seemed out of place amongst her usual stack of dental charts and product brochures, whispering secrets Amelia was suddenly desperate to uncover.
