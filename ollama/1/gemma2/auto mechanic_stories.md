The grease clung to Amelia "Amy" Rose's fingertips like stubborn love.  She ran a rag across her forehead, smearing oil and sweat into a single, shimmering trail. The air hung thick with the scent of gasoline and burnt metal, a familiar perfume that never quite left the confines of Rose's Garage. 

The setting sun cast long shadows through the dusty windows, painting the worn tools and jumbled parts scattered across her workbench in hues of orange and purple. A battered Ford pickup sat on the hoist, its engine exposed like a raw ribcage. Amy knelt beside it, squinting at the tangled mess of wires and hoses. 

This wasn't just any old engine; this was Big Ed's pride and joy, his '69 Mustang convertible, lovingly nicknamed "The Duchess."  Ed had sworn he could hear The Duchess whispering to him, begging for a fix. Amy knew it was more likely a faulty carburetor, but she couldn't deny the desperate plea in Ed's voice when he'd brought it in that morning. 


The whine of crickets and the distant hum of traffic on Highway 10 filled the twilight air. The small town of Pine Ridge, nestled amongst rolling hills and sprawling cotton fields, held its breath as dusk settled. Inside Rose's Garage, Amy knew one thing for certain:  fixing The Duchess wouldn't be easy, but that was never a problem for a mechanic with oil in her blood and a love for the roar of a well-tuned engine.
