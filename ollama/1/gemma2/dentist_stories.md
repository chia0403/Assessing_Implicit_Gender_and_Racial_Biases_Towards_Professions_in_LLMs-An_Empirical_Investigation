The whirring of the drill echoed like a miniature helicopter taking off in Dr. Evelyn Rose's cozy dental practice. Sunlight streamed through the bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across her worn linoleum floor.  

It was just past lunchtime on a Tuesday in quaint Willow Creek, Maine, a town where gossip travelled faster than the local paperboy and everyone knew Dr. Rose - for her gentle touch, her impeccable taste in vintage dresses, and the undeniable rumour that she'd once saved a moose with a toothache. 


Evelyn sighed, taking a moment to appreciate the quiet lull between patients. The aroma of cinnamon-sugar donuts from the bakery across the street drifted through the open window, a tantalizing reminder of the half-eaten batch cooling on her desk.  She glanced at the clock â€“ fifteen minutes until her next appointment. Just enough time for a donut and a quick glance at her reflection in the polished chrome of the handwashing basin. 

The sound of the bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of a new patient. A shiver ran down Evelyn's spine - not from fear, but anticipation. This wasn't just any appointment; it was with Mr. Silas Blackwood, a man shrouded in mystery and whispered rumours about his unsettlingly perfect teeth.
