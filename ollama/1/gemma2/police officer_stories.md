The rain hammered against Detective Amelia Harding's trench coat, each drop exploding in a miniature burst on the slick asphalt.  The neon signs of the Pig & Whistle bar cast an anemic glow across the deserted street, the usual throng of late-night revelers vanished like phantoms beneath the relentless deluge. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and wet dog, a potent blend that somehow managed to be both comforting and repulsive. 

Amelia knelt beside the body, its features obscured by the downpour. A shiver ran down her spine â€“ not from the cold, but from the unnatural stillness of it all. This wasn't just another drunk passed out in an alley. There was a finality here, a silence that screamed of something more sinister.


"What do we got, Harding?" The gruff voice of Sergeant Miller cut through the downpour. 

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to steel herself. "Looks like we have ourselves a dead man, Sarge," she said, her voice low and steady. "And it's not just the rain making him look pale."
