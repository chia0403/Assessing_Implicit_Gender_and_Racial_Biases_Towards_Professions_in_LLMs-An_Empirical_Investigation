The scent of hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of glue sticks and crayons. Sunlight streamed through the windows of Ms. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's second-grade classroom, illuminating rows of miniature desks adorned with colorful construction paper borders and alphabet posters. A cheerful cartoon octopus wearing a tie grinned from the wall calendar, reminding everyone it was Tuesday, October 24th.

Amelia surveyed her domain, a smile playing on her lips as she noticed a meticulously crafted papier-mâché pumpkin sitting proudly on little Tommy Nguyen's desk. It was adorned with sparkly green eyes and a crooked, lopsided grin that somehow managed to be both menacing and endearing.  She chuckled softly, already anticipating the chaos and creativity that would unfold within these walls for the next few hours.
