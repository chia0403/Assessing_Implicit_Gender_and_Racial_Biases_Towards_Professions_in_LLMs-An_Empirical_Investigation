The scent of sawdust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of varnish and the damp smell of aged wood. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of Elias Blackwoodâ€™s workshop, casting long shadows that danced across the workbench littered with tools and half-finished projects. 

Elias, a man weathered by years spent under the open sky and the relentless rhythm of hammer blows, surveyed his domain. His calloused hands, stained with the hues of countless woods, rested on a mahogany chest he was carving. A delicate floral pattern, inspired by a forgotten sketch found tucked away in a dusty attic, took shape beneath his patient touch. He hummed a tuneless melody, a lullaby learned from his grandmother, as he brought life to the wood, transforming it into something both beautiful and functional.

His workshop, nestled on the outskirts of Willow Creek, was a haven for him - a sanctuary away from the bustling town square and the whispers that followed him like shadows.  He preferred the quiet company of wood and tools, their familiar feel grounding him in a world that often felt too chaotic, too unpredictable.


Elias Blackwood. A carpenter with secrets hidden beneath his weathered exterior, yearning for peace amidst the turmoil brewing within him.
