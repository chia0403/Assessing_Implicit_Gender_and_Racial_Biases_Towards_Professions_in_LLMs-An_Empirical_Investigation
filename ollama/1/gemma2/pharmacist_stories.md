The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Rose Beaumont, their sickly yellow glow casting long, distorted shadows across the rows of neatly stacked boxes lining the pharmacy shelves.  The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer and something metallic that Eleanor suspected was from the emergency first-aid kit tucked behind the counter. Outside, a summer storm raged, wind howling through the gaps in the boarded windows.  Thunder rumbled like a distant beast, shaking the small brick building that housed Beaumont’s Pharmacy on Maple Street. 


Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun and her pale blue eyes focused on the prescription label before her, was unfazed by the storm's fury. She was used to it.  The old pharmacy had been her family’s for generations, its sturdy walls holding both her personal history and the memories of countless townspeople who had sought solace, pain relief, or simply a friendly ear within its familiar confines.
