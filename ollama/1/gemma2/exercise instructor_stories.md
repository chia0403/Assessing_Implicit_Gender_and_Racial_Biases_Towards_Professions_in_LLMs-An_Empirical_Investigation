The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Brightwood like a damp towel as she surveyed her class.  Twenty pairs of eyes, hopeful and hesitant, stared back at her from yoga mats laid out across the worn wooden floor of the community center's basement. The scent of stale sweat and disinfectant hung heavy, a familiar aroma that always seemed to permeate this space. Sunlight, weak and watery, filtered through the grimy window high above, casting long shadows that danced with the dust motes swirling in the air.  Amy took a deep breath, the humid air filling her lungs, and plastered on her most encouraging smile. 

"Good morning everyone!" she chirped, her voice carrying across the room. "Welcome to Beginner's Yoga! I'm Amy Brightwood, your instructor for today."


A smattering of polite smiles and murmurs met her greeting. This was a new class, her first attempt at branching out beyond the established spin-and-bootcamp routines she typically led. She hoped they wouldn't be disappointed. After all, even in this small town, there were plenty of more glamorous, more "modern" fitness options vying for attention.
