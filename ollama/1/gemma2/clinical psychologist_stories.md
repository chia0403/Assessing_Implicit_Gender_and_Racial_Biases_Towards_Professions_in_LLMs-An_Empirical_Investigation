Dr. Eleanor Vance adjusted her spectacles, peering at the swirling storm clouds gathering outside her office window. The late afternoon sun was swallowed whole by the tempest, casting an eerie, muted glow across the cluttered desk before her. Papers were piled high, a half-empty mug of lukewarm coffee sat forgotten beside them, and a lone flickering candle battled against the encroaching darkness, its flame dancing like a captive moth.

Eleanor sighed, rubbing the tension from her temples. Her office wasn't exactly known for its cheerful ambiance, but tonight it felt particularly oppressive.  The storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within her. She was exhausted, not just from the demanding day of patient consultations, but from the gnawing anxiety that had become a constant companion in recent weeks. Something was off, she couldn't shake the feeling, like an impending shadow lurking just beyond her periphery.

And then, the doorbell rang, its chime breaking through the silence with an unnerving finality.  A new patient. 


This was Eleanor Vance's world: a dimly lit sanctuary of anxieties and unspoken truths, where storms raged both within and without, and every patient brought with them the potential for revelation, chaos, or sometimes, a glimmer of healing.
