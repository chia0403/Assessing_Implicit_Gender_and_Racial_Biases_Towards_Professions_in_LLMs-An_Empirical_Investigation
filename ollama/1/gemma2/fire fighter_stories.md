The acrid bite of smoke filled Amelia Beatrice Caldwell's nostrils before she even reached the corner. She could see it now, a roiling plume of grey against the bruised twilight sky, licking at the edges of a row of quaint Victorian homes nestled on Elm Street. The sirens wailed their mournful song, a familiar chorus in her life as a firefighter for the Oakhaven Fire Department. 

Amelia, known affectionately as "Bea" to her crew, tugged her helmet tighter, the familiar weight grounding her. This wasn't just another call; this was her neighbourhood. Her childhood home sat just across the street, its ivy-covered walls holding silent memories of laughter and Sunday dinners. Now, it stood bathed in an eerie orange glow, a potential inferno that threatened not just bricks and mortar but the very fabric of her past. 

She clambered onto the engine, adrenaline coursing through her veins as they tore down Maple Avenue, the familiar streets now distorted by fear and urgency. This was more than duty; this was personal.


**Setting:**  Oakhaven, a small, charming town nestled in the rolling hills of New England, known for its well-preserved Victorian architecture and tight-knit community.
