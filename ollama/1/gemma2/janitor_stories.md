The scent of stale coffee and despair hung heavy in the air of the Grand Majestic Hotel, clinging to every dusty corner like an unwelcome guest. Bartholomew "Bart" Quillsworth, weary custodian and self-proclaimed guardian of the hotel's forgotten souls, pushed his mop across the polished floor of the lobby, leaving a glistening trail in his wake. The once opulent space now bore the weight of its history â€“ faded grandeur reflected in chipped marble statues and velvet curtains bleached by time.  

Bart knew every creak of the ancient building, every flicker of the failing chandeliers, every whispered secret lost within the labyrinthine corridors. Tonight, however, the air felt different - thicker, charged with an anticipation that sent a shiver down his spine. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to happen, something momentous, something that would change the Grand Majestic forever.
