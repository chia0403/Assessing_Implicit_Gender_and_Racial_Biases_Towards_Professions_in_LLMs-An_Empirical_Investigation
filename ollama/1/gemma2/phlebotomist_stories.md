The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of purple chairs. The air thrummed with the quiet murmur of patients waiting their turn, punctuated by the occasional rustle of paper and muffled coughs. This was the rhythm of St. Jude’s Hospital's outpatient lab – a symphony of anxieties and needle fears conducted by Amelia Rose Hawthorne, phlebotomist extraordinaire. 

Amelia, with her perpetually bright smile and calming voice, knew every patient’s story before they even spoke it. She could read the fear etched on their faces, the way their fingers twitched nervously, the shallow breaths that betrayed their apprehension.  For Amelia, drawing blood wasn't just a job; it was an act of empathy. 


She glanced at the queue, her gaze lingering on a young boy clutching his mother’s hand, eyes wide with terror. This one would need extra reassurance, Amelia thought, steeling herself to soothe both patient and parent. It was going to be another long day in the heart of St. Jude's.
