The rhythmic hum of the transmitter filled Amelia Josephine "Amy" Croft's workshop, a symphony of electrical currents and crackling static. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt solder, a familiar aroma to Amy, who knew every nuance of it like a beloved perfume. Her workspace was a cramped alcove in the back room of the Rusty Compass Diner, a greasy spoon on the outskirts of Dustbowl, Nevada – a town that lived up to its name. The diner itself was a faded beacon in the desert, its neon sign flickering erratically, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt parking lot. 

Dustbowl thrived on stories whispered from truck drivers passing through and radio chatter crackling over the airwaves, tales of lost gold mines, runaway robots, and government conspiracies. It was a place where reality blurred with fantasy, and Amy's workshop served as a gateway to both worlds. Through her deft fingers and intricate wiring, she could mend broken radios, decipher cryptic messages, and even, on occasion, amplify the whispers of the unknown.
