The roar of the engines was Amelia Beatrice Sterling's lullaby. She leaned against the worn leather of her co-pilot seat, peering out through the dusty windshield of her salvaged P-51 Mustang. The Arizona sun beat down on the desert tarmac, baking the air to a shimmering haze. 

Amelia wasn't flying for glory or national defense anymore. Those days were long gone, replaced by smuggling and running errands for whoever could afford her skills.  Her current mission: delivering a package of unknown contents from the dusty border town of Tombstone to a shadowy contact in Las Vegas. The only clue she had was a crumpled note that read, "Meet me at the neon moon." 


Amelia adjusted her aviator goggles, pushing back a stray strand of fiery red hair.  She knew this run would be different, something about it felt heavy in the air like a storm brewing on the horizon. But as she started the ignition, the familiar hum of the engine chased away any lingering unease. There was only one rule Amelia lived by: once the engines are running, there's no turning back.
