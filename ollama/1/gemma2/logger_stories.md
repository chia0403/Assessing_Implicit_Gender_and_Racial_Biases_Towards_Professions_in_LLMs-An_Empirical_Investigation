The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, sunlight filtering through the towering Douglas firs like fractured emerald glass. A symphony of birdsong filled the morning, punctuated by the occasional crack of a branch underfoot. 

Elias Blackwood shifted his weight, muscles aching from yesterday's haul. His calloused hands tightened around the handle of his chainsaw, the familiar vibration humming against his palm. Sweat beaded on his forehead, mingling with the sawdust clinging to his beard. He was alone, as always, save for the rustling leaves and the watchful gaze of a hawk circling high above. 

Elias wasn't afraid of being alone. The forest was his sanctuary, a place where he could lose himself in the rhythm of work, finding solace in the steady whir of his chainsaw and the satisfying thud of felled timber.  But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along his spine, urging him to turn back, to leave this patch of wilderness untouched. 

He pushed the feeling aside, reminding himself that fear was a luxury he couldn't afford.  The Blackwood family needed the money, and Elias was all they had. He took a deep breath, bracing himself against the unfamiliar tension, and started his engine. The sound roared through the silent forest, shattering the morning calm.
