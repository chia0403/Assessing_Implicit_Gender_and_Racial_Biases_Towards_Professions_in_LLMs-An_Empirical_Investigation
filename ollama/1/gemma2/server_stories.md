The air hung thick with the scent of garlic and sizzling onions.  A symphony of clattering plates, clinking glasses, and boisterous laughter filled "Antonio's," a bustling Italian restaurant tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Boston's North End. Amelia "Amy" Rose, her name tag pinned crookedly to her faded denim apron, weaved between tables with practiced grace, balancing a tray laden with steaming plates of pasta and fragrant bread baskets. She navigated the chaos with a smile, taking orders, refilling water glasses, and placating fussy patrons with practiced ease. The restaurant was in full swing on a Friday night, pulsating with a vibrant energy that both energized and exhausted Amy. 


Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, a feeling of anticipation mixed with unease. Perhaps it was the way the shadows danced across the room in the flickering candlelight, or maybe it was just another long shift getting to her. Whatever the reason, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something unusual was about to happen.
