The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of The Rusty Quill, a dive bar tucked away on a forgotten side street in New Orleans. Amelia "Amy" Rose Carter, her trench coat collar pulled high against the chill of the November night, nursed a lukewarm gin and tonic, her eyes fixed on the man sitting across from her. He was a shadow in the dim light, his face obscured by the brim of his fedora, but Amy could feel his gaze like a hot coal burning into her. This wasn't your average interview; this felt like stepping into a world where truth was a slippery eel, and everyone had something to hide.

The city itself seemed to amplify the tension.  New Orleans, with its vibrant jazz music, voodoo rituals, and labyrinthine French Quarter, held secrets as deep and dark as the Mississippi River that flowed through it. Amy knew this well. She'd spent her career chasing stories in its underbelly, unearthing truths that others preferred left buried. But this case, whispered about in hushed tones in dimly lit bars, was different. It had a darkness to it that sent shivers down her spine.  


This time, Amy wasn't just reporting the news; she was walking into a storm.
