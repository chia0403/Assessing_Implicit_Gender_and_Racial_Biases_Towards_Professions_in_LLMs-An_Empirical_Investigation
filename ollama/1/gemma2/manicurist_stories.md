The air hung thick with the scent of lavender hand cream and nail polish remover in "La Petite Ongle," a cozy corner salon tucked between a bakery and a vintage clothing store on bustling Bleecker Street in New York City. Sunlight slanted through the windows, painting stripes across the rainbow of bottles that lined the walls. Beatrice “Bea” Dubois hummed along to Edith Piaf on the old record player as she meticulously filed a client's chipped emerald nails. 

Bea loved this time of day - the lull before the rush when the city outside pulsed with its usual frenetic energy, but here in her little haven, peace reigned supreme. She could focus on the rhythmic scraping of the file against polished surfaces, the gentle brush of the cuticle pusher, and the quiet murmur of conversation between herself and her client, Mrs. Goldblum, a retired art teacher who always had an interesting anecdote about her latest grandchild's antics. 


But Bea’s tranquil bubble was destined to be shattered. The bell above the door jingled with unusual force, announcing a new arrival – a woman unlike any she’d seen before.
