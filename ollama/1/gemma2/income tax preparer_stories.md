The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Peterson's cluttered desk.  She squinted at the jumble of receipts, W-2s, and half-eaten granola bars scattered across its surface. Outside, Chicago was swathed in a late February grey, mirroring the bleak mood settling over Amy. Tax season had always been stressful, but this year felt different – heavier somehow. Perhaps it was the gnawing anxiety about her own finances, or maybe the looming threat of another national recession casting a long shadow over everyone's livelihood. 

Amy rubbed her temples, the dull ache spreading from behind her eyes to the base of her skull. She needed coffee, desperately.  But first, she had to tackle Mr. Henderson's return – a particularly convoluted case involving rental properties, multiple income streams, and a suspicious number of deductions for "spiritual guidance." 

Amy sighed. This was it. Another day in the trenches of tax preparation, where dreams went to die and coffee fueled survival.
