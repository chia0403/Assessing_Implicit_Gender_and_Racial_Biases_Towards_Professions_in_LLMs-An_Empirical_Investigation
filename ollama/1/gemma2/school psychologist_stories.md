The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s head, casting a sterile glow on the worn linoleum floor of the conference room. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and nervous energy. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee against the windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia. 

She stared at the three figures seated before her: Mrs. Patterson, a frazzled kindergarten teacher clutching a crumpled folder; Principal Thompson, his face drawn and tight with worry; and little Toby, his eyes wide and vacant, sucking on his thumb while perched on the edge of a chair far too big for him. 

Amelia knew this wouldn't be an easy conversation.  Toby had been exhibiting unusual behavior – refusing to speak, drawing disturbing images, and having nightmares that plagued him with terrifying shadows. He was slipping away, swallowed by something dark and unknown. Amelia had a duty to help him, to find the light before it extinguished completely.


**Setting:**

* A small, rural elementary school nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. 
* The year is 2023. Autumn has settled, bringing with it chilly winds and vibrant foliage that does little to disguise the looming darkness surrounding Toby's story.
