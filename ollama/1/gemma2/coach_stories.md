The humid Georgia air hung heavy over Coach Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes as she surveyed the dusty baseball diamond.  Grasshoppers chirped their evening chorus, a soundtrack to the quiet solitude that Ellie craved after a grueling week with her high school team, the Wildcats.  The bleachers groaned in the twilight, offering empty seats for an imagined crowd of cheering fans. 

Ellie kicked at a loose pebble, its dull thud echoing in the stillness. Her mind wasn't on the game itself; it was on the three seniors she'd been coaching for four years â€“ boys who had become more like family than just players. They were leaving soon, heading off to college and their futures, leaving Ellie with an emptiness that threatened to swallow her whole. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the field, painting the scene in hues of orange and purple.  Ellie inhaled deeply, the scent of freshly cut grass mingled with the earthy smell of damp soil. It was a familiar comfort, one she hoped would linger long after these boys were gone. But tonight, even the familiar felt bittersweet.
