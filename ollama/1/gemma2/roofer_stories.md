The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. He wiped sweat from his brow with a grimy rag, momentarily blinding himself as the dust kicked up by his boots settled on the already caked grime of his face. Below him, the city sprawled like a concrete jungle, its skyscrapers glittering menacingly in the midday heat. The air buzzed with traffic and distant sirens, a soundtrack to Silas's solitary labor. He was perched precariously atop Mrs. Periwinkle’s Victorian mansion, fixing a leak in the slate roof that had been plaguing her for weeks. It was a classic case of old age catching up – the once-proud shingles were crumbling and moss crept across their edges like an insidious green cancer.  Silas, with his calloused hands and weathered face, understood the fragility of things. He knew time wore down even the sturdiest structures, just as it wore him down. 


He tightened the last shingle, a sense of quiet satisfaction settling over him. Another job done, another roof saved from the relentless assault of the elements.  Silas surveyed his work, taking in the clean lines and sharp angles of Mrs. Periwinkle’s roof. For all its age, it still held a certain dignity, a resilience that mirrored his own.
