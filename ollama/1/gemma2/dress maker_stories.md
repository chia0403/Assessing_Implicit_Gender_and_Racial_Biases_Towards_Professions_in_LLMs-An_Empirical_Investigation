The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and mothballs in Eleanor Rose Finch's atelier. Sunlight slanted through the dusty skylight, illuminating motes dancing in the air like tiny fireflies. Outside, the cobbled streets of Bath hummed with life, shoppers bartering for fresh produce and children chasing pigeons through the marketplace. But inside, Eleanor was a world apart, her fingers nimble as they stitched together silk panels, transforming them into an ethereal gown destined for Miss Penelope Worthington's grand debutante ball.

Her needle flew in and out of the fabric, its rhythm punctuated by the click-clack of her wooden bobbin. Around her, bolts of vibrant velvet, shimmering satin, and delicate lace spilled from their shelves like a rainbow erupting from a treasure chest. Eleanor breathed deeply, savoring the familiar comfort of her world â€“ a sanctuary woven from thread, needle, and the quiet satisfaction of creation.


This story opens in Bath, England, sometime during the Victorian era.
