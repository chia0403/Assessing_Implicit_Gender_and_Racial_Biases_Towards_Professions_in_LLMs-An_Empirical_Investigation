Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elara Vance's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The sterile white walls seemed to close in on her as she stared at the empty chair opposite her desk, waiting for her next patient.  

Elara was known for her calm demeanor and unwavering empathy. But today, even the familiar scent of lavender essential oil diffusing from the corner couldn't soothe the gnawing anxiety that clung to her like a second skin. Her own past, a tangled web of grief and trauma she had painstakingly untangled in therapy, threatened to unravel again.

Her office was located on the top floor of a converted Victorian building in downtown Seattle, nestled amongst bustling antique shops and cozy cafes. A single potted fern struggled valiantly against the gloomy weather, its emerald leaves catching the dim light filtering through the frosted glass windowpanes. The cityscape beyond the rain-streaked glass was a blur of muted greys and yellows, as if swallowed by the storm. 

Elara took a deep breath, trying to center herself.  She had chosen this profession because she believed in the power of human connection and resilience. She yearned to help others navigate their own storms, but sometimes, it felt like she was losing her footing in her own. The rain intensified, drumming against the glass like a relentless reminder that even on the brightest days, shadows lingered.
