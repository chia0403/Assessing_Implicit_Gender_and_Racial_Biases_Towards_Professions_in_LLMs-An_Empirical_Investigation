The aroma of roasting almonds and cinnamon hung heavy in Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's tiny apartment kitchen, a stark contrast to the clinical sterility of her workplace: Wellness Haven, a bustling health clinic nestled on the cusp of trendy Greenpoint, Brooklyn. Amy loved this duality â€“ the vibrant chaos of the clinic where she dished out dietary advice like candy, and the quiet sanctuary of her home where she crafted nourishing meals from scratch, each ingredient meticulously chosen for its potential to soothe both body and soul. 

But today, the peace was shattered. A phone call from Dr. Lee, her mentor and boss at Wellness Haven, threw Amy's carefully constructed routine into disarray. "There's a new patient," Dr. Lee's voice crackled through the receiver, "a young woman with...unusual dietary restrictions. Needs your expertise, Amy." 

Amy glanced at the simmering pot of lentil soup on the stove, her stomach rumbling in anticipation. This wasn't unusual, patients were constantly arriving with baffling cravings and complex needs.  But Dr. Lee's tone hinted at something more. Something beyond gluten-free or veganism. Something...different. 


Intrigued and slightly apprehensive, Amy took a deep breath and said, "Tell me more about this patient." The pot of soup bubbled ominously, mirroring the storm brewing within her.
