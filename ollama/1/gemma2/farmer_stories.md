The sun, a fat orange yolk in the pale morning sky, barely peeked over the horizon as  Elias Thorne shifted restlessly on his worn porch swing. His calloused fingers tightened around the chipped mug of coffee he’d been nursing for nearly an hour. A thin layer of frost clung to the dew-covered fields that stretched out before him like a patchwork quilt of emerald and gold, each square meticulously tended by Elias and his weathered hands over the past forty years. The air was crisp with the promise of a hard frost later in the day, and a familiar unease coiled in Elias’s gut. This wasn't just about the potential damage to his crops – it was about the whispers he’d been hearing around town. 

Whispers of an unnatural blight creeping through neighboring farms, leaving behind withered fields and hollowed-out soil. Whispers that spoke of strange lights flickering over the cornfields at night and a silence so profound it felt like the very earth was holding its breath. Elias, a man who’d always trusted the rhythms of nature, found himself doubting the familiar solace of his land for the first time.  


The setting is a small rural community nestled in a valley surrounded by rolling hills, somewhere in the American Midwest. The town itself is quiet and steeped in tradition, with weathered barns lining dusty roads and houses built generations ago. Life revolves around the farms, their success dictating the prosperity of the entire community.
