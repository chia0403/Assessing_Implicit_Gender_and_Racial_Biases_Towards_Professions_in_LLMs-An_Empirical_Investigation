The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional whimper from an anxious patient. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Willow Creek Animal Clinic, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor. Dr. Amelia "Amy" Harper adjusted her glasses and sighed, surveying the scene before her. A fluffy Persian cat glared accusingly from a carrier, while a Labrador Retriever with floppy ears chewed nervously on its leash. 

Amy had always loved animals, feeling a deep connection to their silent strength and unwavering loyalty. After years of studying and endless nights fueled by coffee and textbooks, she finally achieved her dream: opening her own practice in the heart of rural Vermont.  It wasn't glamorous, but it was hers. A small community clinic where she could truly make a difference, one furry patient at a time. 


But lately, things hadn't felt right. An undercurrent of unease ran through Willow Creek, and even Amyâ€™s beloved patients seemed burdened by an unspoken worry.
