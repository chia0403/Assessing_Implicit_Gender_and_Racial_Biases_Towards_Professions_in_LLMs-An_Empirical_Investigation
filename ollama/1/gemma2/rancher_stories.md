The wind whipped across the sprawling expanse of the Painted Prairie, whipping at Clara Evangeline Blackwood's braid as she squinted out over her land. Dust devils danced in the distance, their movements mimicking the restless energy churning within her. The sun beat down mercilessly on her weathered face, casting long shadows from the lone mesquite tree that stood sentinel beside her porch. 

Clara adjusted the brim of her worn Stetson and tugged at the faded denim of her work overalls.  The air hung thick with the scent of sagebrush and sweat, a familiar comfort she knew as well as her own heartbeat. This was Black Creek Ranch, where generations of Blackwoods had carved out their lives from the unforgiving land, and Clara intended to see it thrive despite the drought that threatened to turn her dreams to dust.  


This story opens on Clara Evangeline Blackwood's ranch in a fictionalized version of the Painted Prairie region of Montana. The setting is harsh and beautiful, a place where survival depends on resilience and grit.
