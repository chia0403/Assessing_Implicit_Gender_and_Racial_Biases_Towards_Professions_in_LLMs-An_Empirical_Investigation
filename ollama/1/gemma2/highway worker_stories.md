The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Tremont's neck, turning his already sun-weathered skin the color of well-worn leather. Sweat stung his eyes as he wielded the jackhammer, its rhythmic pulse echoing through the stillness of the Arizona desert. The air shimmered with heat, distorting the horizon into a wavering mirage. Around him, the barren landscape stretched out like an endless expanse of ochre and burnt sienna, punctuated only by the skeletal remains of mesquite trees and the occasional prickly pear cactus blooming defiantly in the sun. 

Bart squinted at the highway stretching before him, a silver ribbon snaking through the desolate beauty. His crew was resurfacing a section near the abandoned ghost town of Dustbowl – a place whispered about in hushed tones by locals as cursed. Bart wasn't superstitious, but even he felt a prickle of unease when the wind carried whispers through the skeletal remains of rusted vehicles and crumbling buildings that littered the old town’s outskirts. 


He took another swing with the jackhammer, its vibration buzzing up his arm, a constant companion on these long, lonely days. As he worked, Bart noticed something glinting in the distance – a flash of silver against the dull brown earth. It was too far to make out clearly, but curiosity piqued, Bart decided to investigate after lunch. Maybe it was just some discarded metal from one of Dustbowl's forgotten inhabitants.  Or maybe, just maybe, it was something more.
