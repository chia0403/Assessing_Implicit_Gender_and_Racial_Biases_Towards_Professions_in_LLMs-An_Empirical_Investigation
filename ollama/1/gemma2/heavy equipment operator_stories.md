The sun, a molten fist punching through the dusty haze, beat down on  Jeremiah "Heavy" Hayes's neck as he wrestled with the levers of his Caterpillar 350 excavator. Sweat trickled into his beard, stinging his eyes like acid. He squinted at the horizon, where the Nevada desert stretched out in an endless wave of ochre and burnt orange. Above him, the only movement was a hawk circling lazily, its cry a lonely lament against the rhythmic clang of Heavy's metal behemoth as it tore into the earth. 

Heavy was excavating the foundation for a solar farm, one more piece of progress scarring the desolate landscape. He hated this work, hated the endless grind, the sun-bleached silence broken only by the whine of engines and the whirring of blades. But it paid the bills, kept a roof over his head in this godforsaken town of Dusty Gulch, Nevada, where even the tumbleweeds seemed to sigh with exhaustion.  


He wiped the sweat from his brow with a grimy sleeve, glanced at his battered canteen – empty, of course – and sighed. The day was young, and the work was only just beginning.
