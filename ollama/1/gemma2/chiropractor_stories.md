The scent of cedarwood and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint hum of the Himalayan salt lamp beside Dr. Eleanor Blythe's desk. Sunlight streamed through the large windows of her practice, "Spine & Soul," illuminating dust motes dancing in the still morning air. Outside, a symphony of city sounds - car horns, construction, and the distant laughter of children playing - vibrated through the old brick building. Inside, however, was an oasis of calm. 

Eleanor smoothed down her crisp white lab coat, adjusting the stethoscope hanging around her neck. It was Monday morning, and already her schedule was filling up with patients seeking relief from aches, pains, and stress. But today held something different. Today, a man named Silas Walker, known for his gruff demeanor and rumored link to a local gang, had requested an appointment. 

Eleanor's brow furrowed slightly.  This was uncharted territory. She dealt in the language of vertebrae and muscle tension, not street violence and whispered threats. But she prided herself on helping everyone who walked through her door. With a deep breath, she reached for the appointment book and flipped to Silas Walkerâ€™s entry. "Time to see what's behind those clenched shoulders," she murmured to herself.
