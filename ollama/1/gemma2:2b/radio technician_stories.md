The whirring of the antenna farm was the soundtrack to Elias Thorne's life.  For years, he'd worked tirelessly at the Crossroads Radio Network - an oasis of static-filled airwaves amidst a sea of digital noise. The vast expanse of the plains surrounding the station felt like another character in the story itself, its endless sweep painting the sky with fading hues of orange and purple as dusk settled over it. Elias wasn't just a radio technician; he was the last link to a forgotten era, when voices whispered across miles on crackling static rather than fleeting digital bytes.

His job was routine: calibrating transmitters, troubleshooting antenna problems, ensuring that every signal went out strong, clear, and with the exact tone required to broadcast across the country for the small town's weekly public service announcements. But lately, a new kind of hum had started to infiltrate his usually calm life - a sense of urgency, almost like someone was tuning in for something specific. It was as if the air itself was holding its breath, waiting for a signal that just hadnâ€™t arrived yet.
