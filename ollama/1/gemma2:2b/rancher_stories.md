The sun, sinking towards the horizon like a bruised plum, cast long shadows across Dusty Hollow Ranch. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of sagebrush and dust, clinging to Caleb Thorne's worn denim jacket as he surveyed his sprawling property. It was twilight in the Montana valley, but the sky held more secrets than a thousand whispered rumors. 

Caleb, known by everyone from town to the weathered faces of the neighboring ranches simply as "Cletus," was a man built like the land he worked - strong shoulders and calloused hands that knew every creak of his trusty old barn. Heâ€™d spent his life tending the land, raising cattle alongside generations of Thorne men before him.  A lifetime of sun-scorched days and moonlit nights had etched the story of his weathered face and taught him to read the whispers of the wind - sometimes they carried warnings, other times blessings. 

Tonight, though, a chill settled deep in Caleb's bones, unlike the usual Montana breeze that kissed the valley floor with just a hint of frost. The wind seemed to carry a different kind of song tonight, a discordant melody that spoke of secrets best left hidden.  And as he gazed out at the endless expanse of his land, a flicker of something unfamiliarity danced in his eyes, a feeling as vast and unknown as the vast plains before him.
