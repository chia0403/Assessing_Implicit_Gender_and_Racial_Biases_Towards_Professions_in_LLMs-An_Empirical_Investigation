Rain hammered against the windows of St. Mary's General Hospital, blurring the already dim cityscape into a swirling grey canvas. Inside, Registered Nurse Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood, with her normally neat auburn hair escaping its bun in a chaotic tendril, felt like she was fighting a losing battle against the chaos that seemed to permeate every corner. The unit was abuzz with a frenetic energy; patients were arriving faster than they could be assigned, and staff members exchanged worried glances under layers of stethoscopes and scrubs.  

Ellie pushed through the throng, her footsteps echoing faintly on the worn linoleum floor. Her usual calm demeanor felt stretched thin as she scanned the hallway, taking in the tired faces of colleagues and the mounting anxieties etched upon the brows of new arrivals. The familiar scent of disinfectant and fear hung heavy in the air, a palpable reminder of the fragility and vulnerability of her patients. 

Today was particularly rough. She had just finished assisting with a hysterectomy when news came that a young mother admitted for postpartum depression had gone into cardiac arrest â€“ her son's cries echoing off the sterile walls, a silent plea for help in the storm outside. Ellie felt a wave of exhaustion crash over her; she needed a moment, maybe a cup of coffee and a good book to escape the relentless reality of the ward.
