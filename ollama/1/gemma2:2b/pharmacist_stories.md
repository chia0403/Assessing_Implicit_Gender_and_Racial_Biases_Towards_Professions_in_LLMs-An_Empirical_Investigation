Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Hawthorne's pharmacy, blurring the already fading sunset into a kaleidoscope of orange and purple hues. Inside, Amelia was meticulously sorting through a stack of expired medication packets, her brow furrowed in concentration. The scent of old wood polish and simmering chamomile tea hung heavy, a comforting aroma juxtaposed by the sterile coldness of the fluorescent lights that cast harsh shadows on the neatly organized shelves. 

Amelia had always found solace in the predictable rhythm of her days – mixing powders, dispensing prescriptions, and offering a listening ear to patients who sought out her small-town pharmacy for more than just remedies. The storm outside mirrored the tumult brewing within her, however. Her grandmother's legacy – the very foundation of Hawthorne's Pharmacy - was on the line.  Her father, the previous owner, had suffered a debilitating stroke two years ago and was now in a state-run care facility. Amelia yearned to restore his beloved pharmacy to its former glory, but she also felt the pressure of carrying on their family name while navigating her own dreams.
