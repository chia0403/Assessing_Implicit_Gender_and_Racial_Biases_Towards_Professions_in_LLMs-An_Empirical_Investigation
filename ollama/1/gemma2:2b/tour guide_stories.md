The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia's auburn hair around her face as she stood at the precipice overlooking the roaring expanse of the Bay of St. Albans. Below, boats bobbed in the turquoise water like oversized beetles.  She wasn't afraid of heights; that was a given. Amelia, with her wide smile and easy charm, could coax smiles out of the most petrified tourists.  But this morning, a certain gnawing unease settled in her stomach, churning it into a knot as she adjusted her worn leather hat. 

Today wasn't just any tour - today was the day. The day Amelia finally faced her own fears and delivered the "lost" history of the Bay to its unsuspecting audience.  Her small, family-run tour company had always been known for its focus on the fantastical tales spun by local elders - myths about mermaids in hidden coves, krakens beneath the waves, the legendary sea witch's curse on the abandoned lighthouse.  But today, she would be unveiling something real, something hidden in plain sight for generations, something that could change everything: an ancient map leading to a forgotten shipwreck said to hold untold riches and secrets of the Bayâ€™s forgotten past. 


 **Setting:** A coastal town in Brittany, France known for its wild beauty and legends of seafaring lore.  The tour company operates out of a quaint waterfront lodge with exposed beams, crackling fireplaces, and a collection of nautical artifacts on display.
