The rhythmic tapping of clippers against acrylic was Amelia's soundtrack to life.  From the soft murmur of her clients' gossip in the tiny corner salon she called home, to the whirring of the nail file against polished mahogany, every moment in "Nails By Amelia" felt like a carefully choreographed ballet. Her shop, tucked away on a bustling but unassuming street corner in Brooklyn's bustling Williamsburg neighborhood, was an oasis of calm amidst the city’s constant hum. 

Her name, whispered with reverence by even the most skeptical regulars, wasn't just a moniker; it was Amelia 'The Architect' Bellrose's trademark.  Amelia, who had once dreamt of revolutionizing nail art through intricate geometric designs, was now known for her deft hand and ability to coax out the beauty in every flawed cuticle. Her clients weren’t just customers – they were friends she cherished, confidantes sharing their lives with a quiet trust that Amelia nurtured. 

Today was no different. A young musician, Ethan, sat nervously before her. He clutched a crumpled setlist like a shield, his eyes darting between Amelia's steady hands and the pristine canvas of his nails.  He hadn't spoken a word, not since she began working on his fingers.  Amelia knew it was about more than just a mani-pedi; Ethan was facing an audition that would change everything for him.
