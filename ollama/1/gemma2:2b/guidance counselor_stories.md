The humid air hung thick in the air conditioning-less counseling room, mirroring Ms. Amelia Croft's own anxiety as she stared at the overflowing stack of forms on her desk. "Another year, another deluge," she muttered to herself. The title 'Guidance Counselor' was more accurately a euphemism for 'Social Worker 2.0'.  The only difference being that Amelia didn't have any patients with actual conditions to fix, but a steady stream of teens struggling with seemingly random anxieties.

The bell above the door jingled, announcing the arrival of her newest student, Marcus Walker. He was tall and gangly, all elbows and unkempt blond hair. His face, buried in his phone screen, seemed perpetually etched in an expression of teenage discontent. The air around him shimmered with a disconcerting aura Amelia couldn't quite place.  This wasn't just typical high school angst; there was something deeper in Marcus's demeanor, a simmering tension she hadn't encountered before. As Amelia cleared her throat to begin the meeting, she thought of all the anxieties that had come before â€“ from college applications and parental expectations to social circles and cliques.  This time, however, it felt different. 


**Setting:** The story takes place in a large public high school called "Westbrook Academy" located in suburban America, with typical sights like sprawling fields behind the building, football field games on Saturdays, and the usual anxieties of teenage life.

 **Character:** Amelia Croft, the main character, is a dedicated guidance counselor who's seen it all in her 15 years at Westbrook.  She feels overwhelmed by the pressure to help students navigate their way through high school with no real "fix."   


**Opening questions:** 

* What kind of problems does Marcus have?
* Does Amelia think she can truly understand Marcus and his anxieties, or will this case fall outside her usual range of experience? 
*  What will be the climax of this first meeting between Amelia and Marcus?
