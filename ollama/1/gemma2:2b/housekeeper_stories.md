##  The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** Blackwood Manor, a sprawling Victorian mansion nestled amongst the craggy peaks of Dartmoor in England. Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows, mimicking the frenetic drumming of Amelia Thorne's heart as she polished silver to the gleam of moonlight. The manor had been left derelict for years after the death of Lord Ashworth, its once lively hallways now echoing with silence save for the whispers of wind and the occasional creak of settling floorboards.

**Character:** Amelia Thorne, a woman forged in the crucible of London's harsh realities, found herself amidst the shadows of Blackwood Manor on an inheritance she couldn’t fully comprehend.  At 34, her life had been one long cycle of dustpans, mop buckets and whispered secrets.  But here, surrounded by portraits frozen in time and smelling of old books and forgotten dreams, Amelia felt a stirring within her own soul.

**Opening:** “Do you ever feel like the walls are…breathing?” Amelia asked, turning a heavy vase of wilting lavender to reveal its cracked porcelain side. The silence that followed was thick and unsettling, even more so when she glanced at Mr. Thorne’s portrait above the fireplace.  The man looked down upon her with an icy stare, his lips eternally frozen in a perpetual sneer. 

"Not like this," a low voice rasped from behind her. "They only whisper to those who listen."
