The scent of chamomile and lavender hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Rose's apron like a second skin.  It was a comforting aroma that never failed to soothe her frayed nerves, yet today it felt more like an oppressive blanket, weighing down on her as she looked at the unruly mess of hair before her. 

Amy's salon, "The Knotted Sparrow," nestled amidst the bustling streets of Brighton, was usually filled with the cheerful chatter and the rhythmic clink of scissors against human hair. Today, however, a silence hung heavy in the air like fog.  A thick storm had rolled in on the coast earlier that day, and the sudden downpour hadn't helped matters; the window displays were plastered with dripping sheets of water, and the usually vibrant street was cloaked in an eerie grey melancholy. 

Inside, Amy stared at the mirror reflecting a woman whose face seemed to crumble under her own stress.  "Evelyn," she whispered, a name that always felt heavy with unspoken tension. "You've got more knots than a fishing net, darling."  The words were meant to be comforting, but they tasted bitter on Amyâ€™s tongue.
