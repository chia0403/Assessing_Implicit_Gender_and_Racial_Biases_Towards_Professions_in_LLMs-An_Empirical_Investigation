The sun dipped behind the foothills of the Rockies, casting long shadows across Dr. Amelia "Amy" Sterling's small clinic in Jackson Hole.  Snow began to dance on the peaks, a delicate ballet against the deepening twilight.  It was the kind of day that made Amy yearn for the vast open plains she'd grown up dreaming of, yet she knew this was her home now. Home, but far from idyllic. The air hung heavy with the scent of pine and desperation, a familiar mixture in Jackson Hole - the promise of wild beauty intertwined with the raw edges of a broken landscape.  Amy sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the cluttered examination table, its surface scarred with years of worn-down tape and spilled medications. 

Her focus was on the furry patient in front of her: a young husky named Koda, his fur matted and stained from an unknown ordeal.  Kodaâ€™s whining, a mixture of fear and pain, resonated through the small room. Amy ran a hand along the dog's sleek coat, a knot of worry tightening in her stomach. This was a life she never expected to lead - a blend of wild compassion and quiet resignation as she worked to mend the broken promises of a land yearning for renewal.
