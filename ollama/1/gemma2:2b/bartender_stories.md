The smoky air hung thick as tar in The Rusty Pelican, a saloon clinging to its existence on the edge of a dying desert town.  Its faded glory was only partially redeemed by the warm amber glow emanating from the mahogany bar, where Finn "Hawkeye" O'Connell stood behind it.  A man whose weathered hands told a story of countless nights and countless shots, Hawkeye had become The Pelican's resident ghost â€“ blending in with the creaky floorboards and chipped paint until you almost missed him altogether. 

He was a fixture as much as the flickering gaslight above the bar, silently observing the ebb and flow of humanity that poured through its doors like water seeking an oasis.  The clientele tonight was as varied as the desert itself: weary miners, grizzled prospectors, and lone drifters searching for solace in their own company, all washed down with potent doses of despair or a fleeting hope.  Tonight's symphony wasn't music; it was silence punctuated by hushed whispers and drunken confessions, all swirling within the smoky haze that clung to everything. 


Finn "Hawkeye" O'Connell: A bartender whose life story mirrored the worn walls of his saloon.
