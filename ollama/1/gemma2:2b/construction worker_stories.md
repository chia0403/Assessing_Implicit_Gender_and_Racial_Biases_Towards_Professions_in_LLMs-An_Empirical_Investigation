Rain hammered against the steel roof of the unfinished apartment building like a blacksmith's hammer against hot iron. A symphony of drips and hisses echoed through the cavernous space as the wind whipped around him, rattling windows in the twenty-year-old structure.  Inside, the air hung heavy with dust motes dancing in the dim beams of John "Jack" Callahan's headlamp. He tugged at his worn flannel, shivering despite the flimsy jacket he’d been wearing all day. 

John, or “Jack” as everyone called him, wasn’t built for this kind of weather. Not a man of comfort, not even in the sweltering summer months. Yet here he was, tasked with securing the newly erected beams at the top floor of the building. The wind tugged at his worn denim work pants, each gust carrying the bitter scent of salt from the nearby ocean. It was always a struggle to focus in such conditions; the constant threat of falling debris felt like an undercurrent pulsing through every move he made.

"Jack!" A voice crackled over the walkie-talkie strapped to his belt.  “You got the last section secured?”  It was Michael, his foreman, his voice a gravelly echo in the vast emptiness of the building. 


The wind shrieked its approval, and Jack gave a weary smile. "Just finishing up, Mike." He adjusted the beam's precarious position on the top floor window and leaned back against the scaffolding. The world felt like it was tilting ever so slightly, the city lights blurring at the edges of the rain-streaked windows. 


He knew he should call for a stop, but something about this job, this building, kept him tethered to the endless tasks.  Something about his gut told him there was more to this place than just concrete and steel. He'd felt it since day one. Something like a story waiting to be uncovered, a secret buried beneath layers of dust and rain.
