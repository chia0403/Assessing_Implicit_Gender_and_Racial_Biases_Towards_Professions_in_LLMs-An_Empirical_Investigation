The relentless desert sun beat down on Daniel "Danny" Lawson's back, turning his weathered denim shirt to a sticky mess. The air shimmered with heat waves that danced around him like phantom shadows as he surveyed the stretch of asphalt before him.  Mile marker 275 – just another day, another patch of highway in the vast expanse of Nevada's desolate landscape.  Danny ran a calloused thumb across his forehead, wiping away the sweat forming a crusty film on his skin. It wasn’t so much a job as it was a life sentence he seemed to be serving, a life spent repairing the arteries that bled gasoline and dreams through this unforgiving terrain. 

The truck hummed its engine song of monotonous progress behind him,  Danny's eyes fixed on the cracks in the asphalt that pulsed like angry veins beneath his boots. A harsh desert wind picked up, whipping sand across the road. He wiped his brow again, a fleeting memory of a summer storm flashing through his mind – rain and mud, back when he was just a boy with wild hair and dreams bigger than this godforsaken state. He hadn't seen rain in years. Not since that time, decades ago, that he swore he'd leave the desert behind and chase something real. But somewhere between dust storms and endless hours of work, those dreams had been choked by routine.

Now, all that remained were these miles, the echoing emptiness, and the stubborn, grinding reality of his life.
