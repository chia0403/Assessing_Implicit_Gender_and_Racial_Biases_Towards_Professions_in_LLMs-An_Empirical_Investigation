The acrid smell of woodsmoke and blood hung heavy in the air, thick as fog on a November morning.  Bartholomew Grimstone, "Bart" to those who knew him well, worked with a deftness born of years spent wrestling sides of beef and trimming hams like an old-fashioned dance. He was known for his sturdy hands, calloused from the countless hours spent at work, and the faint line of kindness that ran through his broad, weathered face. The small butcher shop, nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, had been a fixture since before Bart's grandfather had passed on, keeping generations of families fed with their signature dry-aged steaks and freshly made sausages.  But today, there was something different, something unsettling, clinging to the air like the scent of burnt herbs.

Oakhaven, normally buzzing with morning life as villagers hurried about their day, seemed eerily silent. The cobblestones were slick with rain, reflecting a distorted image of the gray sky above. It cast long shadows from the crooked chimneys and towering trees that lined the street, each one seeming to watch Bart's every move.
