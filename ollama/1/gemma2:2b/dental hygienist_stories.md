## The Dentally Disconcerting Case 

**Setting:** A bustling city dentist's office, its white-walled rooms bathed in warm morning light. Posters promoting healthy smiles adorned the walls, alongside framed photos of smiling patients.  

**Character:**  Amelia "Amy" Finch, a dental hygienist with a heart of gold and hands that knew exactly where to find the plaque on any surface. Despite her profession's often-overlooked glamour, Amy lived for the feeling of clean teeth, both literally and figuratively. 


**Story Opening:**

The morning hummed into a cacophony of whirring drills, scraping tools, and the gentle clink of metal against enamel.  Amy adjusted her scrubs, the familiar scent of antiseptic clinging to them. "Morning, Amy!" chirped Mrs. Peterson, the ever-optimistic receptionist, her smile as bright as the sun streaming through the windowpane. 

"Mrs. Peterson," Amy sighed, giving a weary but appreciative wave, "I wouldn't mind a little less sunshine and a touch more of my own sunshine."  She gestured towards the open file drawer, filled with patient charts, each one a tiny puzzle demanding her meticulous attention. A faint tremor ran through the usually steady Amelia. 

"What's got your brow furrowed, Amy?" Mrs. Peterson inquired, placing a warm mug into her hands. "Some of our new patients have been...interesting."  Amy bit back a sigh. This wasn't unusual, but lately, things had taken a turn for the weird. A missing molar, an inexplicable toothache in a teenage boy with a penchant for skateboarding, and then there was Mr. Henderson â€“ an elderly gentleman who swore his teeth were turning into squirrels.
