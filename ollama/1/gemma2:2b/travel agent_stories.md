Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Ms. Eleanor Thistlewick’s office, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the already frayed nerves of her otherwise perpetually-tired soul. Eleanor was known for being able to sell dreams – and even the most fantastical of them, from hot air balloon rides over the Amazon to staying in an authentic Mongolian yurt, came with the promise of a well-orchestrated adventure in Eleanor’s capable hands. But today, the world outside her office felt like a storm that wouldn't subside, mirroring the one brewing within her.  

It had been three weeks since she’d received the call. The voice on the other end, thick with an unmistakable urgency, had shattered the calm predictability of Eleanor's routine. Her father's death, he said, was not just a passing, inevitable chapter; it was a chaotic whirlwind that left behind an unfillable void. "It's like something tore right through his life," the voice had rasped, before abruptly cutting off, leaving her to grapple with the unsettling silence. 

Eleanor rubbed her eyes, the flickering fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across her face. The travel agency she’d built from the ground up was more than a business; it was an extension of her father's legacy, his own adventurous spirit now woven into every itinerary, every booking, every carefully crafted experience. Now, with this unforeseen twist in her life, Eleanor felt adrift – unsure of which course to take next.

The story opens within Ms. Eleanor Thistlewick’s travel agency in the quaint seaside town of Oakhaven, nestled amidst rolling hills and a windswept coastline. It's a place where time seems to slow down and where the ocean's roar offers solace against the world’s relentless pace.
