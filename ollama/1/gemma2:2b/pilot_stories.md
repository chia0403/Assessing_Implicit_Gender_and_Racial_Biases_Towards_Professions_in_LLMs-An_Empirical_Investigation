## Story Opening: The Last Flight

**Setting:** A sprawling desert highway cuts through the heart of the American Southwest. The sun beats down on rusted windmills and the cracked earth, baking the air with relentless intensity.  The silence is broken only by the occasional whirring drone of a distant helicopter or the howl of an unseen coyote in the brush. 

**Main Character:** Amelia "Ace" Hayes - her nickname earned during years spent dodging sandstorms and reckless maneuvers during her daredevil flying days. Now, she sits in the cockpit of her vintage Piper Cherokee, its faded paint reflecting the ochre sky. The engine is a guttural purr, each rumble a familiar song from a life lived on the edge.

**Opening Lines:**

"This ain't your mama's air show, son." Amelia muttered, adjusting the worn leather gloves that rested on her lap. Her eyes, sharp and blue as the desert sky, scanned the horizon for any sign of the approaching storm. The wind whipped around her, carrying the scent of ozone and dust. A thousand memories of crashes, near misses, and daring maneuvers raced through her mind, each one a ghost whispering in the cockpit's silence.  "It's always something," she murmured, tapping her finger against the throttle. "That's just how it goes."
