The smell hit Theodore "Theo" Cartwright first - a mix of stale beer, ozone, and something distinctly metallic that he couldn't quite place. It clung to his worn overalls like a second skin as he squeezed through the grime-coated entrance of Mrs. O’Malley’s Victorian house. A groan from the pipes behind him was a welcome soundtrack to Theo's usual complaints about leaky faucets and stubborn toilets.  He stepped further into the living room, where Mrs. O’Malley sat hunched over a chipped porcelain teapot, her face etched with worry lines that seemed deeper than her age. 

“Theo, thank heavens you're here,” she said in a voice that rasped like dry leaves underfoot. “The boiler's given up the ghost! And my granddaughter, Marybeth…she’s got this horrible cold.” Mrs. O'Malley gestured towards the window where a pale, frail child huddled by the dying light of a fireplace, her nose dripping with every sniffle.  

Theo took off his helmet and ran a hand through his thinning hair, a grimace tugging at his lips. The steam from Mrs. O’Malley’s teapot swirled around him like ghosts, each wisp whispering tales of forgotten pipes and long-abandoned dreams. This was the kind of day that made you wonder what was more likely to break: the old Victorian's plumbing or your spirit.
