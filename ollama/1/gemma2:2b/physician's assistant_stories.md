## Story Opening:

The air hung thick with anticipation, heavy like it was trying to suffocate them all in its own metallic tang.  Dr. Elias Blackwood, his usually jovial face drawn tight with worry, adjusted his glasses and squinted at the X-ray of a patient's femur. It wasn't supposed to be this way. The young man, barely 25, was supposed to have defied fate. A clean break, they'd said. Simple surgery, quick recovery. But the x-rays painted a different picture – fractured, twisted, impossibly mangled.

Elias ran his hand through his already disheveled hair, its unruly grey strands contrasting starkly with his steely blue eyes. The hospital's sterile corridors echoed with unspoken anxieties, mirroring the tension swirling in Elias’ chest as he surveyed the waiting room full of worried faces. He was a physician’s assistant at the esteemed Blackwood Memorial Hospital, entrusted with the lives of their most vulnerable patients.  

**Setting:**

A bustling modern hospital ward nestled within the heart of an affluent city. The stark white walls and gleaming stainless steel equipment felt like a stark contrast to the worn-out wooden floor and faded floral curtains used in the more "traditional" private hospitals in his father's hometown. 


**Character**:  Elias Blackwood, a Physician’s Assistant. Elias is driven, dedicated, but haunted by past medical tragedies he can never quite shake off. He carries a certain stoicism, always focused on the task at hand, and rarely smiles unless prompted by one of his closest colleagues or patients – especially after the unfortunate incident involving the young boy with the mysterious illness.
