## The Case of the Missing Cupcake

**Setting:** A bustling city street corner in Seattle's vibrant Pike Place Market, 2023.  The aroma of fresh coffee beans mingled with the salty scent of fish from the nearby stalls, and tourists milled about with their camera phones, oblivious to the secrets hidden behind the brightly coloured awnings. This is a place where dreams are sold alongside oysters, and hope can be found in the smallest of gestures.

**Main Character:**  The name is Amelia 'Amy' Bellweather, but she’s known as "Amie" amongst her colleagues and clients alike.  A probation officer with ten years under her belt, Amie navigates the city's complicated social fabric like a seasoned sailor in a tempestuous sea. She's seen it all: from first-time offenders battling addiction to hardened criminals seeking redemption. 

**Opening:**

Amie tapped on her worn leather notebook, idly flipping its pages to a particularly sticky spot – where she’d inadvertently splashed a rogue coffee stain last week. The air hung heavy with the sweet scent of cherry pie from the nearby bakery, but Amie was focused on the file in her hands.  Her eyes flitted over the photos: Michael "Mikey" Evans, 24 years old, staring back at her with haunted eyes, his face obscured by a messy beard and wild hair, and a missing...cupcake. It wasn't just any cupcake. This one was for Mikey's probation supervisor, Mrs. Peterson, who had taken to calling him "The Cupcake King" ever since he’d started his sentence in the Seattle State Penitentiary. 

"Mikey," she muttered under her breath,  running a hand through her short, blonde hair, "I swear I’ve seen you eat a whole dozen cherry cupcakes in one sitting." A wry smile graced her lips as she recalled the last time they'd met. "Seems like he was on a mission to conquer this town...and now he's missing his most beloved treat." 

A pang of concern twisted in Amie’s chest, but a flicker of professional determination sparked within. After all, there were bigger fish to fry than the mystery of a missing cupcake.
