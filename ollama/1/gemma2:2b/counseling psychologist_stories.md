Rain pattered against the windowpanes, a melancholic rhythm that mirrored the unease swirling in Dr. Eleanor Thorne's stomach. The late afternoon light cast long shadows on her meticulously arranged office, each object in its place, reflecting the precision of the woman she was: a master of logic, order, and careful observation.  But tonight, even the usual calm of her practice felt like a fragile mirage. Tonight, she wasn't just analyzing human behavior; she was facing it head-on. 

Eleanor was staring at a picture - not on a file or in an album, but simply hanging on her wall, a faded photograph of a laughing child with messy blonde hair and sun-kissed cheeks, holding a stick insect like it were a prized possession. The girl's name, Lily, had been the catalyst for what was supposed to be Eleanor’s “weekend getaway” – a retreat from the emotional overload she'd been experiencing since taking on this new case. 

It hadn't gone as planned.  Lily’s parents were struggling with the sudden and unexplained disappearance of their daughter two months prior, and the grief was thick enough to suffocate even Eleanor's sharpest intellect. The police had no leads, and Eleanor felt increasingly trapped in a labyrinth of unanswered questions and her own internal struggle.
