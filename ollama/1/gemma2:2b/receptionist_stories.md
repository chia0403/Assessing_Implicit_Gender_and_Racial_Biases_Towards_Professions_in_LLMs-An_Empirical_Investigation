## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** A bustling mid-century office building in downtown Chicago. Sunlight streams through floor-to-ceiling windows that overlook a chaotic mix of skyscrapers, honking taxis, and hurrying pedestrians. 


**Character:**  Evelyn "Evie" Thorne - young, energetic receptionist with auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun. Despite her youthful appearance, Evelyn carries herself with an air of quiet authority inherited from years spent navigating the minefield of office politics and demanding clients.  Her days are filled with juggling multiple tasks: answering calls, maintaining the schedule board, filing paperwork, and delivering messages that often feel more like whispered secrets than mere announcements.


**Story Opening:**

Evie sighed as she pushed aside a stack of overdue invoices, her fingertips grazing the worn edges of each document. It was 3 PM, nearing the usual afternoon lull in the building’s lifeblood – Mr. Blackwood's law firm. The silence before the inevitable flood of clients and their anxieties had begun to feel more oppressive than anything else.  She pulled a crumpled napkin out of her desk drawer, trying to wipe away the residue of a forgotten lunch while simultaneously attempting to ignore the increasingly loud tapping on the reception area door. 

"Evie," Mr. Blackwood's voice boomed through the small doorway with an unsettling cheeriness that felt more like an accusation than a greeting. "You've got another mystery visitor for us."
