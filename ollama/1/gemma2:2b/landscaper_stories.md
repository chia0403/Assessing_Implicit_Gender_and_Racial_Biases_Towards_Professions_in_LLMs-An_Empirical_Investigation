The late afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised plums and burnt sienna as Bartholomew "Bart" Hawthorne surveyed his work.  His canvas was less a field of vibrant colors than a patchwork quilt of concrete and creeping weeds, each patch stitched together by the relentless rhythm of summer rain and his ever-present sweat. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass â€“ a smell that had both soothed Bart since he was young and now irked him to no end as he stared out at the neglected landscape before him.  

Bart, a man built like an oak tree but possessed by a springy step and eyes crinkled with years spent chasing sunshine, ran a calloused hand through his thinning brown hair. It was moments like this, when the day's labor had left him weary, that he yearned for something more than mowing lawns and battling weeds. He'd always wanted to be a painter, not just a landscaper. But life in his small town of Willow Creek, with its quiet routine and stagnant ambition, had never allowed for much else.

Tonight, though, he felt like he could almost taste the tang of possibility on the back of his tongue. He'd received a single, crisp letter earlier that day, inviting him to an auction of salvaged art pieces. It was his last shot at a future he dared not dream about until now. As he finished loading the mower and walked towards his modest cottage at the edge of town, Bart knew this was more than just another day in the life he'd been forced into.  It was his chance to paint, literally, his own destiny.
