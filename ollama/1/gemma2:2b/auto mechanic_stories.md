Rain lashed against the garage door like tiny fists pounding a drum solo, echoing in the cavernous space.  Inside, dust motes danced in the amber glow of an overhead light, while the scent of gasoline and old oil hung heavy in the air. The rhythmic hum of a nearby engine filled the silence, punctuated by the occasional clanging of tools as young Silas "Sly" Jackson tinkered with a rusty Chevy pickup truck. 

Silas, all lanky limbs and grease-stained overalls, was known throughout his small town as an expert mechanic, able to coax life back into any machine that dared to cough its last breath. He could dismantle a car like a seasoned surgeon, his nimble hands working with practiced ease over intricate machinery. But tonight, the frustration was thicker than the oil on his workbench, heavier than the storm raging outside.  A customer's pride and joy - a vintage Mustang Shelby GT500 - sat in the middle of the garage, groaning under the weight of Silas's unspoken burden.
