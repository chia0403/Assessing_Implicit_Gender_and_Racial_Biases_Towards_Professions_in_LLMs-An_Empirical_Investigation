The late afternoon sun slanted through the gaps in the curtains, painting the studio in hues of burnt orange and dusty pink. Dust motes danced in the golden light as Esme Carter meticulously rolled out her amethyst-colored massage table. Each day felt like entering a different world within this space â€“ calm and serene, punctuated by the rhythmic whirring of a fan and the gentle murmur of aromatherapy blends.  Esme's small studio nestled behind a vintage bookstore on Elm Street was her sanctuary; a place where tension melted away under the weight of soft blankets and the quiet hum of healing hands. 


Tonight, though, the air held an unfamiliar sense of unease. It had been almost two weeks since Mrs. Peterson, the elderly owner of the quaint bakery across the street, first stumbled into Esme's studio after a bad fall. Since then, the scent of fresh bread and cinnamon had taken on a metallic tang, and the usual chatter of customers was replaced by an unsettling silence.  It all felt... off.
