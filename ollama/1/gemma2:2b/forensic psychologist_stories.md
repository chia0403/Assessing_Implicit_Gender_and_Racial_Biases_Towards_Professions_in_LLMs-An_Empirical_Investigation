The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and regret in Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office. It was less a place for introspection and more a battlefield littered with broken minds. She ran her hand over the worn leather of her armchair, tracing the pattern left by countless hours spent dissecting the darkest corners of humanity. Outside, rain hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the chaos in her own head as she reviewed another case file. Evelyn’s latest subject was a peculiar one: Mr. Bartholomew “Bart” Sterling, accused of murder and suspected of being part of a shadowy cult.

It was an institution shrouded in secrecy; whispers about its past and the rituals performed within its walls were as prevalent as its grim facade. Evelyn knew this place housed secrets that would rewrite her understanding of good and evil, a truth she sought to unlock through her years of forensic psychology. As she stared at the case file, she couldn't shake off the feeling that there was something more to Bart’s story - something hidden beneath layers of trauma and self-inflicted isolation.
