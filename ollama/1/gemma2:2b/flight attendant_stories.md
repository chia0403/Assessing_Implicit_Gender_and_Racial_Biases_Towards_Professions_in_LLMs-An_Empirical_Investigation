The turquoise shimmer of the Pacific Ocean stretched endlessly before Amelia "Maybelle" Croft, its waves lapping against the pier like gentle giants. The salty air whipped strands of hair across her face as she watched passengers disembark from the plane, their expressions weary and hopeful in equal measure. A symphony of chattering voices rose above the rhythmic thrumming of the engines still lingering on the runway. Maybelle inhaled deeply, the scent of jasmine and something distinctly metallic clinging to the air – another passenger's unease after a particularly rough landing. 

Maybelle was no stranger to seeing people at their most vulnerable. Every day, she traversed the turbulent skies as a flight attendant for Pacific Star Airlines, her smile a beacon of calm in the chaos that often accompanied travel.  But this time, something felt off. A sense of foreboding clung to her like a persistent fog on the deck of a ferry. She adjusted her signature navy blue uniform, the crisp fabric reassuring under her fingertips. The journey was long, and Maybelle's routine – reading passengers' anxieties through their murmured conversations, anticipating needs before they even surfaced – seemed particularly vital today.  She knew there were stories here, untold narratives hidden behind every weary sigh and hesitant smile. 


Tonight, she wasn't just a flight attendant. Tonight, she was the storyteller of the skies.
