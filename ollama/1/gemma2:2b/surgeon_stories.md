## Setting: The Operating Room

**Setting:** A sterile, white-walled operating room at Mercy General Hospital in Chicago. Neon lights cast sharp shadows across the stainless steel instruments laid out like skeletal limbs on a table. 

**Character:** Dr. Elias Thorne. His once youthful face is etched with fatigue, his hands callused and scarred from years of wielding scalpel and forceps. The faint scent of antiseptic hangs heavy in the air, clinging to his worn scrubs like memories. He stands at the head of the table, eyes narrowed as he scans the X-ray monitor that shows a tangled network of arteries and veins inside a patient's chest, a map of danger laid out before him.  

**Opening:**

"Thorne," whispered Dr. Miller, the Head Nurse, her voice thin in the echoing room. "Another aneurysm this time? I thought you were finally letting go."  She looked at him with an unspoken concern, mirroring the worry etched on his own brow. Elias's heart pounded against his ribs like a caged bird. He had pushed himself to the limit for years, chasing down every challenge, every impossible case. The thrill of a successful operation was fleeting, soon overshadowed by the inevitable weight of mortality he carried in his hands. This time, the risk felt different. It tasted bitter on his tongue, like the old promise of something good gone sour. He steeled himself as if facing the storm itself.

"Just another day," Elias murmured, forcing a calm he wasn't sure he possessed. "Don't worry yourself."
