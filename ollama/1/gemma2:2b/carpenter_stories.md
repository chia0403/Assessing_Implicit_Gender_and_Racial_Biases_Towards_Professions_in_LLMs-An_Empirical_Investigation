The scent of cedar and linseed oil clung to Elias Thorne like an old friend as he surveyed his workshop. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the floorboards, turning dust motes into dancing gnomes.  It was here, amongst the whirring saws and hammering chisels, that Elias felt most alive. He ran a calloused thumb across a meticulously crafted wooden birdhouse, each curve of the roof a testament to his years spent mastering the craft. His father had been a woodworker too, passing down his knowledge through whispered tales and weathered scraps of lumber. Now, it was Elias’ turn to carry on that legacy, even if his own life felt as out of focus as a poorly-aligned join.

Elias' workshop sat nestled within a quiet corner of the small coastal town of Havenwood.  The town held a quaint charm, with its cobblestone streets and faded Victorian houses that huddled against the sea breeze. It was a place where time seemed to drift along the rhythm of the tides, where secrets whispered in the wind and dreams took root amongst the wildflowers growing along the town's edges. 

But for Elias, Havenwood felt like an anchor holding him back from the sea he longed to navigate. He wasn't just a carpenter; he was a man on the brink of something bigger, perhaps even something wilder. And his grandfather’s weathered journal held the key, promising adventure and riches beyond imagination in its worn-out pages.
