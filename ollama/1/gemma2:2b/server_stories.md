Rain lashed against the windows of The Blue Heron, mimicking the rhythm of Elara's anxiety.  A storm had swept in overnight, turning the usually serene lakefront into a swirling mass of gray water.  Inside, the warm air of "Sunday brunch" and the lingering scent of lemon-ginger tea clung desperately to the atmosphere.  Elara wiped down her usual haunt, the corner booth with its worn red velvet cushions and faded floral print umbrella, a familiar space where she felt more at home than anywhere else. She knew every creak in the floorboards and the whispered secrets exchanged by the regulars at their respective corners of the cafe's universe. 

Tonight, though, Elara wasn't tending to her usual tables.  She was stuck with the newly-opened "Cafe Concierge" service - a new venture from Mrs. Thompson, owner of The Blue Heron. A small, handwritten sign next to the entrance promised 'Your personal guide to culinary bliss', and Elara felt as though she had been thrown into the deep end of her own private, chaotic sea.  Her name tag read "Elara," the same elegant cursive font used on every other staff member's name tags - but tonight, it was all a little too different, a little too real.
