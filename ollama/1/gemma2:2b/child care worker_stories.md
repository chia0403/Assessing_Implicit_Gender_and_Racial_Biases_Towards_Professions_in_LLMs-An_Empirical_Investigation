Rain lashed against the nursery windows, mimicking the frantic drumming of Amelia's heart.  Her breath formed wisps in the frigid air as she stared out at the swollen river cascading down the street.  The storm had been raging for hours, and her usually placid group of four-year-olds were now a symphony of chaos. 

**Amelia "Amy" Reynolds**, with her trademark messy bun and a worn canvas apron splashed with more than just paint - the mark of countless spilled juice boxes and crayon scribbles -  was in the thick of it. It was supposed to be a calm, sunny day filled with baking cookies and giggling over silly songs, but today, even the sugar-highs seemed powerless against the growing storm's fury. 

The youngest boy, Timmy, was now sobbing uncontrollably after his prized stuffed panda went missing in the midst of the pandemonium.  His tantrum echoed through the room like a tiny thunderstorm itself, and Amy felt her frustration mount alongside the swelling tides outside. But even amidst the chaos, a flicker of calm washed over her as she saw Lily, the usually stoic girl, offering Timmy a warm hug. 
 
Amy knew that while the storm raged on outside, there was magic in these tiny moments, little sparks of connection and resilience, waiting to ignite. And she had an inkling that she'd be needed to fan those flames, no matter how stormy the day became.
