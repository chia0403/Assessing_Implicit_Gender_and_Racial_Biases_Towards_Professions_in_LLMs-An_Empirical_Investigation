Here's a potential story opening:

The dimly lit diner was a staple of Main Street USA, its faded neon sign creaking in the gentle breeze like an old man's laughter. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and yesterday's fries, but Emma Jean Thompson didn't mind - it was home. She had been serving breakfast to the locals for five years now, watching as families grew up and couples came together over plates of pancakes and eggs.

Emma Jean wiped down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time that morning, her eyes scanning the room with a practiced air. The regulars were all accounted for: Joe at the booth by the window, nursing his usual cup of black coffee; Mrs. Jenkins in the corner, sipping tea and reading the newspaper; and young Tommy Lee, bouncing around on his toes like a rubber ball, waiting for his mom's return.

But today was different. Today, Emma Jean had a feeling that something was off. The sun was shining a little too brightly, casting long shadows across the diner's Formica tables. And when she glanced out into the parking lot, she saw a stranger standing by the old Chevy truck, his eyes fixed intently on her.

What did he want?
