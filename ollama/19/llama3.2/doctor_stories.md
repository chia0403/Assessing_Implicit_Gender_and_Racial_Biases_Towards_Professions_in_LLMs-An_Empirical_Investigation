Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Everley Alexandra "Evie" Thompson stood at the edge of her hospital room window, gazing out over the rain-soaked streets of Seattle. The grey sky seemed to match the melancholy that had been weighing on her mind all week. As a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon, Evie was no stranger to high-pressure situations and long hours, but lately, she'd found herself struggling to find meaning in her work.

The hospital's sleek glass towers pierced the fog-shrouded sky like shards of steel, their sterile glow a stark contrast to the chaotic world outside. The sounds of siren-wailing ambulances and muffled conversations from the ICU drifted up through the vents, a constant reminder that this was where Evie spent most of her waking hours.

Evie's eyes wandered back to the cityscape as she pushed aside the curtains, revealing a glimpse of Puget Sound in the distance. She had always loved this view â€“ it was one of the few things that brought her peace in the midst of chaos. But today, even the sight of the water seemed muted, weighed down by the heavy feeling that had been following her all day.

Just as Evie turned away from the window, her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her colleague, Dr. Lee: "Meet me in Conference Room 3 ASAP. We need to discuss a case."
