Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes that lined its main street. The smell of freshly cut wood and sawdust wafted through the air from the woodworking shop on the corner, where 35-year-old carpenter Julian "Jules" Thompson spent most of his days creating beautiful furniture and fixing broken ones for the town's residents.

Julian lived in a small bungalow on Elm Street, just a few blocks away from his shop. He had inherited the business from his father, who had started it back in the 1980s, and had worked hard to build a reputation as one of the best carpenters in town. Over the years, Julian had become synonymous with quality craftsmanship and attention to detail, and his shop was always bustling with customers looking for custom pieces or repairs.

As the day drew to a close, Julian packed up his tools and headed home, exhausted but satisfied with the work he had done. He looked forward to a quiet evening at home, maybe playing some guitar or watching a movie, before getting ready for the next day's projects. Little did he know, however, that tonight would be different - tonight would bring an unexpected visit from an old friend, one who would change everything Julian thought he knew about his life and business forever.
