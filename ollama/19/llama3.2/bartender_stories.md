Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had set over the bustling streets of New Orleans' French Quarter, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded bars and clubs that lined Bourbon Street. Inside "Mama LeRoux's" bar, a small, unassuming establishment nestled between a vintage clothing shop and a jazz club, bartender Emilia Josephine Thibodeaux was wiping down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time that night. The air was thick with the smell of sweat, cheap perfume, and the faint tang of absinthe.

As she poured a shot of bourbon for a tipsy patron, Emilia's mind wandered to the stack of bills on her kitchen table at home – rent was due tomorrow, and she couldn't afford to pay it. Her best friend, Rachel, had already lent her enough money to get by until payday, but that was only temporary relief.

Just then, a harried-looking woman in her mid-thirties stumbled onto the stool next to Emilia's, slamming down a handful of bills on the counter and slumping against the bar. "Give me another round, sweetheart," she slurred, flashing a worn-out smile at Emilia. As the woman caught Emilia's eye, something about her seemed off – but it was hard to place.

And that's when Emilia noticed the small tattoo on the woman's wrist: a delicate silver snake coiled around a single word – "Mémoire".
