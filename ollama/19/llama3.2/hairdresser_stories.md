Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint Main Street. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the local caf√©, mingling with the sound of laughter and chatter from the evening crowd.

As she locked the door behind her, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.
