Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The dimly lit office of Jenkins & Co., Drafting Workers was a far cry from the bustling streets of New Haven, Connecticut, where 27-year-old Emily Elizabeth Thompson spent most of her days. As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Emily gazed out the window at the worn brick buildings and narrow alleys of the old city's industrial district. The smell of freshly printed blueprints wafted through the air, mingling with the scent of stale cigarettes and yesterday's lunch.

It was a typical Monday morning for Emily, who had already spent hours poring over designs and schematics for the construction of a new office complex on Chapel Street. Her boss, Mr. Jenkins, was notorious for his demanding work ethic, and Emily had learned to thrive under pressure. As she carefully labeled and filed her neatly arranged drawings, her mind began to wander to the peculiar meeting she'd had with the CEO of Thompson's Construction the day before.

The CEO, a suave businessman named Victor LaSalle, had hinted at a top-secret project that required Emily's exceptional drafting skills. Rumors swirled around town about a potential new development on the outskirts of New Haven, but no one knew much about it. What was certain, however, was that Emily's services would be in high demand if Thompson's Construction landed the contract.

With her eyes scanning the stack of papers in front of her, Emily felt an itch she couldn't quite scratch â€“ a nagging sense that something big was on the horizon, and she was ready to take center stage.
