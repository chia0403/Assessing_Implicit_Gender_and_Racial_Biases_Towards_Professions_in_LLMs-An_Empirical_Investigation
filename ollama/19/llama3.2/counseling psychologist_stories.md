Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her car and onto the cracked asphalt of the University of Oregon's campus, her eyes scanning the familiar landscape with a sense of unease. The soft gray skies above seemed to match the melancholy mood that had been settling in since the start of the semester.

As a counseling psychologist specializing in trauma and grief, Lexi had seen her fair share of students struggling to cope with the pressures of college life. But there was something about this particular group that felt different – like they were carrying a weight that no one else seemed to notice.

Lexi's own journey to becoming a counselor had been marked by tragedy when she was just a teenager. The loss of her younger sister in a tragic accident had left Lexi reeling, but it had also sparked a passion for helping others work through their own pain and find ways to heal. She had spent the past decade honing her skills and building a reputation as one of the most compassionate and insightful counselors on campus.

As she made her way towards the student union building, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that this semester was going to be different – that something was stirring beneath the surface, waiting to erupt. She took a deep breath and pushed open the doors, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

The sound of murmured conversations and the soft hum of laptops filled the air as students began to filter in for their morning classes. Lexi spotted a familiar figure standing by the coffee machine – her colleague and friend, Dr. Ryan Jenkins, who was also teaching a class on trauma-informed care. He caught her eye and raised an eyebrow, as if sharing some unspoken knowledge that only they could understand.

Lexi smiled wryly to herself as she made her way towards Ryan, feeling the familiar sense of camaraderie that came with knowing someone who understood the depths of human suffering. Little did she know, this semester would bring a new challenge – one that would test her skills as a counselor and push her own personal demons to the surface.
