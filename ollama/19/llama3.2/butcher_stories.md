Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of woodsmoke and fresh meat from the local butcher shop.

Inside the butcher shop, Emilia Rose "Mia" Thompson carefully sliced a thin cut of venison, her hands moving with a practiced ease that came from years of working with sharp knives and heavy cuts. The dim lighting and the smell of blood and flesh had always been a bit overwhelming to some, but to Mia, it was home.

As the daughter of a butcher, Mia had grown up learning the ins and outs of the trade from her father, who had passed away a year ago when she was struggling to keep the shop afloat. Since then, Mia had poured every ounce of energy into preserving his legacy and keeping Ravenswood's meat supply fresh and plentiful.

Despite the long hours and physical demands of the job, Mia took pride in what she did. She loved nothing more than crafting beautiful cuts of meat for her customers, each one a work of art that told a story of its own. And yet, as the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months, Mia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off in Ravenswood. The townspeople seemed quieter than usual, their smiles less genuine, and the once-familiar rhythms of the town felt... wrong.

As she wrapped the venison in paper and placed it on the counter for a customer to take away, Mia's mind began to wander back to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing her of late. And as she looked up at the clock above the door, ticking steadily into the darkness, she couldn't help but wonder: what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of Ravenswood, waiting to be uncovered?
