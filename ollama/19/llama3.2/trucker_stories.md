Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the Arizona desert, casting a warm orange glow over the vast expanse of Route 40, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins pulled his Peterbilt 389 into the dimly lit parking lot of the Maverick Truck Stop. The fluorescent lights above the entrance flickered to life, casting an eerie hum over the deserted landscape.

Jack, a grizzled trucker with a weathered complexion and a sharp jawline, rubbed the weariness from his eyes as he killed the engine. He had been driving for hours, ever since leaving the highway behind in New Mexico, and all he wanted was a hot meal and a chance to stretch his legs.

The Maverick's neon sign creaked in the gentle breeze, beckoning Jack to come inside. He slid out of the driver's seat, stretching his 6'2" frame as he yawned, revealing a hint of denture gap on his left side. A gold stud glinted in his left earlobe, and his trucker hat was pulled low over his forehead.

As Jack made his way towards the convenience store, the sound of diesel engines fading into the distance, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It had been a long time since he'd felt this uneasy, this...watchful.

"What's got your goat, Hawk?" his CB radio crackled, breaking the silence.

Jack hesitated for a moment before responding in his gravelly voice. "Just passing through, guys. Nothing's changing my route."

The only response was static and silence, but Jack knew better than to believe that.
