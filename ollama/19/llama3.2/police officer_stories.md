Here's a potential story opening:

Detective Emilia Rose Thompson stood at the edge of the mist-shrouded lake, the worn wooden dock creaking beneath her boots as she gazed out across the water. The first light of dawn was creeping over the trees, casting an eerie glow over the scene before her. A single spotlight cast a narrow beam of light down onto the wet pavement, illuminating the faint impression of footprints leading away from the lake's edge.

As a detective with the small-town police department of Ravenswood, Illinois, Emilia had seen her fair share of crimes and tragedies. But there was something about this particular case that felt off, like a nagging sense of unease she couldn't shake. The victim, 25-year-old Sarah Jenkins, had been found floating face down in the lake just hours before, with no signs of struggle or foul play.

The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Emilia felt the familiar weight of her duty settling onto her shoulders like a cloak. She took a deep breath, the cool mist filling her lungs as she began to survey the scene once more. Her eyes scanned the area, taking in every detail - the scattered reeds, the discarded fishing net, the single, rusted boat moored to the dock.

And then, her gaze landed on something that made her heart skip a beat: a small piece of paper, caught in the tangled reeds near the lake's edge. It was crumpled and sodden, but as Emilia carefully plucked it free, she saw that it was a fragment of a note - a single sentence, scrawled in hasty handwriting:

"Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone."
