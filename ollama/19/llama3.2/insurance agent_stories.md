Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle glistened like polished onyx, reflecting the neon lights of the city's towering skyscrapers. It was a drizzly autumn evening, the kind that made you want to curl up with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the world outside.

In his office high above the city's bustle, insurance agent Emmet Ryan Winston adjusted his tie for what felt like the hundredth time, his eyes scanning the rows of neatly organized files on his desk. A 37-year-old native Seattleite, Emmet had spent years building a successful career in the world of risk management, but tonight he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

As he poured himself a glass of scotch from the decanter on his desk, Emmet's gaze drifted out the window to the sleek, silver tower of the Belltown Development. The company's flagship office building was rumored to be in need of an upgrade - or perhaps even replacement - and rumors had been circulating that they were putting their headquarters up for sale.

Just as Emmet was about to make a phone call to one of his contacts, his desk phone rang, shrill and insistent. He picked it up, hoping against hope that it wouldn't be another telemarketer or unwanted pitchman.

"Ryan Winston Insurance Agency," he said, his voice smooth and professional.

The voice on the other end of the line was low and gravelly, sending a shiver down Emmet's spine.

"I'm calling from Belltown Development. We need to talk."
