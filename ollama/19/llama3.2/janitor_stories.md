Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights above the rows of steel lockers cast an unforgiving glow over the drab, grey hallway of Ravenswood High School. The air was thick with the scent of stale air and yesterday's cafeteria food. It was just another typical day for Janitorial Specialist Third Class (and part-time janitor) Harrison Everett Jenkins, who trudged along the tile floor on his worn sneakers, his eyes scanning the rows of lockers for any signs of mess or trouble.

Harrison had been working at Ravenswood High for over five years, and despite its reputation as one of the most prestigious schools in the country, he'd seen it all. From the entitled rich kids who thought they owned the place to the struggling students who barely made ends meet. He knew every nook and cranny, every hidden corner and secret passage.

As he worked, Harrison's mind wandered to his own life outside of the school. His family had moved to Ravenswood a few years ago, seeking a fresh start after a messy divorce and a string of dead-end jobs. But so far, nothing seemed to be working out as planned. His part-time janitorial gig barely paid the bills, and he was starting to feel like he was stuck in limbo.

Just as Harrison was about to finish his rounds, he heard a faint noise coming from one of the classrooms on the other side of the hallway. It sounded like someone – or something – was moving around inside.
