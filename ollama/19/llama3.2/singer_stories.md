Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit stage at the iconic Ruby Room music venue was bathed in the soft glow of vintage overhead lights, casting an intimate ambiance over the crowded room. It was a chilly autumn evening in New Orleans, and the air was alive with the scent of magnolias and the sounds of jazz drifting from the French Quarter's street corners.

On stage, Aurora "Rory" Elara Wynter stood poised at the edge of the microphone stand, her eyes fixed on the sea of expectant faces before her. With a voice that could melt steel and a presence that commanded attention, Rory was known as one of the most talented singers in the city's thriving music scene.

As she began to warm up for the evening's show, Rory's thoughts turned to the letter she had received just days before - an offer from a mysterious record label executive with a proposition that could change the course of her life forever. Little did she know, this chance encounter would set her on a collision course with secrets, scandals, and the very fabric of her own identity.

With a deep breath, Rory launched into the opening chords of her latest single, "Midnight in the Bayou," and the crowd erupted into cheers as the lights danced around her like fireflies on a summer night.
