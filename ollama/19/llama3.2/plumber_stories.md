Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these, when the darkness seemed to press in from all sides like a physical force. Inside the cramped, dimly lit office of Jenkins Plumbing, the air was thick with the smell of stale cigarettes and worn leather. The flickering fluorescent lights overhead cast eerie shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the very spirits of the pipes themselves were watching and waiting.

Amidst this claustrophobic atmosphere, Harold Edwin Fletcher - better known to his friends and colleagues simply as "Fletch" - sat hunched over a cluttered desk, pouring over the latest batch of service calls. A gruff, rugged man in his late 40s with a scruffy beard and a thick head of gray hair, Fletch had spent decades mastering the art of plumbing. But despite his expertise, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a nagging sense of unease that had been growing inside him for weeks.

As he scanned the stack of invoices and notes in front of him, one particular call caught his eye: a mysterious request from an anonymous client for emergency repairs to their ancient, supposedly "haunted" pipe system. The pay was too good to pass up - and besides, Fletch had always been drawn to the weird and the unknown. Little did he know, this would be the job that would change everything.
