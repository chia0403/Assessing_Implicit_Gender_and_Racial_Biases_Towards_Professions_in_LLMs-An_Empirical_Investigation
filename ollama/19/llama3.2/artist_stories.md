Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans were always at their most unforgiving on mornings like this. The misty veil that shrouded the city seemed to cling to everything, making the ancient buildings appear as if they'd grown organically from the very earth itself. Amidst this soggy backdrop, Aurora "Rory" Thibodeaux hunched over her easel, her dark hair plastered to her forehead as she mixed colors on her palette.

A painter and sculptor by trade, Rory had spent countless hours honing her craft in the city's vibrant art scene. Her studio, nestled above a Cajun restaurant on Frenchmen Street, was a testament to her love of the city â€“ a riotous tangle of canvases, paint-stained rags, and half-finished sculptures that seemed to defy the conventions of good taste.

As she worked, Rory felt a restlessness growing inside her, like a spark waiting to ignite. She'd been struggling with her latest project, a series of charcoal drawings inspired by the city's haunted history. The symbols and sigils that danced across her canvases had begun to feel suffocating, as if they were trying to convey some message she couldn't quite decipher.

The phone on her easel rang, shrill in the silence. Rory picked it up, expecting a call from a prospective client or maybe even an art critic looking for a review. Instead, she was met with a low, gravelly voice that sent a shiver down her spine.

"Rory, it's been a while," said the voice, sending a cold dread creeping through her veins. "I heard you'd be the one to help me unravel the mystery of your family's past."

And with that, Rory knew her life was about to change in ways she couldn't even begin to imagine.
