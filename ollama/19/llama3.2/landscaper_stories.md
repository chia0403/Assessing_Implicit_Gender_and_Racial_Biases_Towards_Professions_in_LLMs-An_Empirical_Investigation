Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was already high in the sky by the time Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, Jr. finished his morning coffee and began to fuel up for another day of work on the lush green lawns of Oakwood Estates. As the owner and operator of his own landscaping business, Hawk's Landscaping Co., he had spent the past decade perfecting the art of transforming ordinary yards into serene oases.

Located in the heart of suburban Oakdale, New Jersey, Hawk's Landscaping Co. was a beloved fixture on the community's annual holiday decorating circuit, and its reputation for top-notch service and attention to detail had earned it a loyal client base of homeowners and small business owners alike.

As Hawk loaded up his trusty truck with the day's worth of supplies – bags of mulch, bundles of fresh evergreen branches, and an assortment of colorful flowers – he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a smell that usually signaled the arrival of autumn's vibrant foliage. But this year, something felt different.

A faint sense of unease crept over Hawk as he pulled out of his driveway and onto the winding roads of Oakwood Estates. He had received a mysterious phone call earlier that morning from an unknown number, with only one word on the voicemail: "Hawk." The message was cryptic, but it sent a shiver down his spine.

With a sense of trepidation, Hawk hit the gas and headed out to face whatever challenges lay ahead. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a season that would test everything he thought he knew about himself, his business, and the very fabric of his community.
