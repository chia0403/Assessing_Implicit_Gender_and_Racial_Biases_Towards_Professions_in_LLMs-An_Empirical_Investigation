Here's a potential story opening:

The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the cramped, cluttered office that served as home for Emily Elizabeth Taylor, Certified Public Accountant (CPA) and sole proprietor of Taylor & Co. Accounting Services. It was a chilly autumn evening in late October, and outside, the rain lashed down on the pavement like a relentless drumbeat, casting a melancholy mood over the already drizzly streets of downtown Denver.

Emily slumped back in her worn leather chair, her eyes fixed on the stack of dusty ledgers and financial reports that seemed to be closing in on her from all sides. The phone on her desk was ringing, shrill and insistent, but she let it ring out, its repetitive tone a mocking echo of her own frustration with the day's work.

With a heavy sigh, Emily pushed back her chair and stood up, stretching her arms over her head like a restless cat. It had been a long week, filled with audits and tax returns that seemed to go on forever. She was already dreading the weekend, when she would be expected to tidy up the office and prepare for the influx of new clients who always seemed to arrive just as she was about to catch her breath.

As she gazed out the rain-soaked window, Emily's mind began to wander to more pressing concerns â€“ like the strange letter she had received in the mail that morning. A single sheet of paper, folded neatly into a square, with no return address and only two words scrawled on it: "Come home."
