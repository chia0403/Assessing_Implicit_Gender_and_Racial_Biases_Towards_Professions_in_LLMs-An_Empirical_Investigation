The wind whipped across the dusty plains, biting at Esmeralda “Esme” Callahan’s face as she surveyed her herd. Her weathered Stetson tilted low, shielding her eyes from the relentless sun that beat down on the parched earth. The once-lush grasslands were now brittle and brown, whispering a silent plea for rain. Esme’s calloused fingers tightened around the reins of her chestnut mare, Belle. Worry gnawed at her gut – the drought was dragging on longer than anyone had anticipated, and her cattle were growing thin.

This vast swathe of Wyoming land, stretching out under a boundless sky, had been in her family for generations. Esme felt its rhythms deep in her bones, knew the scent of sagebrush after a rain, the mournful cry of coyotes at dusk. But even her years of experience couldn’t predict when this drought would break, leaving her future as uncertain as the swirling dust devils dancing on the horizon.
