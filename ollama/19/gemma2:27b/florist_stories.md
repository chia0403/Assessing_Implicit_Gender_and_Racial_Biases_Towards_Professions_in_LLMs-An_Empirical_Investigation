Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Blooms & Buds", drumming a restless rhythm that echoed Amelia Rose Hawthorne's own unease. Outside, the cobbled streets of Edinburgh were slick with water, reflecting the dull grey sky like a thousand fractured mirrors. The scent of damp earth and wet blooms hung heavy in the air, usually a comforting aroma for Amelia, but today it did little to soothe her frayed nerves.

Her shop, normally a haven of vibrant colors and sweet perfume, felt strangely hollow.  A lone bouquet of sunflowers stood on the counter, their cheerful faces drooping slightly as if mirroring Amelia's own mood. Today was the anniversary of her mother's passing, and every year, the familiar ache returned, sharper than thorns.
