The Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's back, turning his worn denim shirt into a furnace. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy horizon where endless ochre desert met an equally endless sky. Eli squinted, wiping the stinging brine with the back of his calloused hand. He glanced at the thermometer mounted on the backhoe – 108 degrees. Just another scorcher in the Silver State.

Eli was stationed on mile marker 347, a lonely stretch of I-80 notorious for its sudden dust devils and errant tumbleweeds. His job was simple: replace a section of guardrail damaged by a runaway semi last week. Simple, in theory. In practice, battling the relentless sun and unforgiving desert landscape felt like wrestling an angry Gila monster.  

Today, however, something felt different. An unsettling quiet hung in the air, broken only by the monotonous drone of cicadas and the occasional whine of a distant truck. Eli couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched. He scanned the shimmering heat waves rising from the asphalt, searching for any sign of life besides himself and the vultures circling overhead.  

He shrugged it off as desert paranoia – a common ailment for anyone who spent too long under the unforgiving Nevada sun. Still, Eli couldn't help but feel a shiver crawl down his spine. He bent over his toolbox, picking up his wrench with a grunt. He needed to finish this job and get back to the air-conditioned sanctuary of the motel room before sundown.

But as he straightened up, something in the distance caught his eye. A glint of metal reflecting the sunlight.  It wasn't the familiar sheen of a passing vehicle. This was something different. Something buried…and waiting.
