The stale scent of bleach and disinfectant clung to Esmeralda "Esme" Cortez like a second skin. It was a smell she'd come to associate with both comfort and unease. Comfort because it meant she was in her element, amongst the vials, needles, and whirring centrifuges of the Sunnyside Clinic phlebotomy lab. Unease because today felt...off. 

The fluorescent lights buzzed incessantly, casting a sickly yellow glow on the linoleum floor. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on Phoenix, turning the air into shimmering waves of heat. Even the usually cheerful chatter of her colleagues seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling quiet punctuated only by the rhythmic beep of the blood pressure monitor. Esme glanced at the clock: 10:47 a.m. Just another Tuesday, she thought, trying to quell the prickling sensation of dread that had been crawling up her spine all morning. Little did she know, this Tuesday was about to become anything but ordinary.
