The acrid scent of smoke stung Elias "Eli" Hawthorne's nostrils even before the alarm in his quarters blared to life. It was a smell he knew intimately, a harbinger of chaos and potential devastation. Eli scrambled out of bed, adrenaline already coursing through his veins. He yanked on his turnout gear, the heavy fabric familiar and comforting against his skin. 

Outside, the pre-dawn sky was a bruise-colored canvas, barely illuminated by the weak glow of streetlights. The fire station buzzed with controlled activity. Eli joined his crew as they piled into Engine 32, the red beast rumbling to life and spitting out a plume of diesel exhaust.  Their destination: an old textile mill on the outskirts of town, reported ablaze by a passerby.

Eli gripped the back of the seat, his heart hammering a steady rhythm against his ribs. Every call was different, every fire a unique beast. But there was one constant: the primal fear that gnawed at him, the knowledge that lives hung in the balance with every passing second.
