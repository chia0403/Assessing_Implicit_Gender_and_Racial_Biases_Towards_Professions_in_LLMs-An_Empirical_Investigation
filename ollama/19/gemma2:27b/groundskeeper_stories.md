The rusted gate groaned like an arthritic old man as Silas Blackwood pushed it open, the sound echoing through the stillness of the cemetery. Dawn was just breaking, painting the sky in shades of lavender and pale gold, but the air still held the chill of night. Dew clung to the emerald grass, sparkling like scattered diamonds under the weak sunlight. Silas inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves strangely comforting. He loved this time of day, before the mourners arrived with their heavy grief and hushed whispers.

Silas was head groundskeeper at Willow Creek Cemetery, a sprawling expanse of ancient oaks, weeping willows, and granite mausoleums. For fifty years, he had tended to this place of eternal rest, his calloused hands shaping the landscape into a haven of tranquility amidst the bustling city.
