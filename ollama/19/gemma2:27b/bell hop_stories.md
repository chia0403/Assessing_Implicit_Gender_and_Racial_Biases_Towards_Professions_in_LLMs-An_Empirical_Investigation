The brass bell on the revolving door chimed with a mournful clang as Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew wrestled a steamer trunk twice his size through the entrance. Sweat beaded on his brow despite the blast of air conditioning hitting him square in the face. The Grand Blackwood Hotel, with its gleaming marble floors and opulent chandeliers, always seemed to suck the cool air right out of him.

He grunted, maneuvering the trunk towards the bellhop stand, a polished mahogany masterpiece carved with scenes of mythical beasts. A gaggle of tourists jostled past him, their faces flushed with the excitement of a new adventure. Teddy envied them, their lives filled with exotic destinations and untold stories. His own life was confined to these marble walls, a monotonous symphony of luggage and polite smiles.

Today, however, felt different. There was an electric hum in the air, a sense of anticipation that sent shivers down his spine. A handwritten note taped to the bellhop stand caught his eye: "Room 404. VIP Guest. Discretion Advised." Teddy swallowed hard. This wasn't your average tourist. Something big was coming, and Teddy, against all odds, might just be at the center of it.
