Rain lashed against the bakery window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign into an impressionistic smudge. Elodie Marchand sighed, her breath fogging the glass as she peered out at the relentless downpour. It was nights like these that made her question her decision to open a tiny nutritional counseling practice above a bakery renowned for its decadent pastries. The irony wasn't lost on her.

Elodie adjusted the hand-painted sign on her door, "Nourishment & Wellness: Eat Well, Live Better," before turning back to her cluttered desk. Spread out were stacks of client files, recipes scribbled on napkins, and a half-eaten bowl of quinoa salad â€“ a testament to her own struggles with balancing dietary ideals with the allure of freshly baked croissants wafting up from downstairs. Tonight, however, the aroma was tinged with something unfamiliar - a hint of cinnamon and nutmeg.

A chime tinkled as the bakery door opened, bringing a gust of wind and dampness into the small waiting area. Elodie looked up, surprised to see a customer braving the storm at this hour. The figure paused hesitantly by the frosted glass pane separating the two businesses before tentatively rapping on it.
