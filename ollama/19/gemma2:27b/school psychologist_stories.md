Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Blackwood's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. The faded floral wallpaper seemed to absorb the gloom, highlighting the starkness of the metal desk where she sat hunched over a file labeled "Ethan Carter - Case Review."

She wanted to help Ethan, truly she did, but his case felt like wading through quicksand â€“ every step forward seemed met with two steps back.

The rhythmic ticking of the old clock on the wall underscored the weight of her responsibility. Outside, the small town of Harmony Creek huddled under a blanket of grey, mirroring Amelia's own sense of unease. The quaint Victorian houses and meticulously manicured lawns held no comfort for her today.  She needed a breakthrough, a glimmer of hope in Ethan's otherwise bleak trajectory. But where could she find it?
