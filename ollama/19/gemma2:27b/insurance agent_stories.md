Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest. Outside, the neon glow of the insurance agency sign flickered erratically, casting long shadows across the threadbare carpet. Bart, tie loosened and sleeves rolled up, stared at the file before him: Mrs. Ethel Peabody, 72, homeowner’s insurance claim - fire damage. He knew it was a routine case, but something about the old woman's handwritten letter, detailing how her beloved cat had perished in the blaze, tugged at his heartstrings.

His office, tucked away on a dingy side street in downtown Zenith City, felt like a mausoleum for forgotten dreams. Stacks of dusty files towered precariously on every surface, and the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Bart sighed, wishing he could escape this bureaucratic purgatory, but his student loans had him tethered to his desk, chained by the relentless pursuit of quarterly quotas.

But today was different. Today, something felt…off. The insistent ringing of the phone jolted him back to reality, the shrill sound slicing through the oppressive silence like a rusty blade. He picked up the receiver, bracing himself for another disgruntled customer or a cold call from an insurance broker hawking some newfangled policy. Instead, a voice, gravelly and urgent, rasped through the line: "Bartholomew Quill? They're coming for you."
