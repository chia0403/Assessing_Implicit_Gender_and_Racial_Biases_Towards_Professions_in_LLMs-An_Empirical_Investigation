The air in Mrs. Haverford's mansion always smelled faintly of lavender and regret. Eloise Finch, her hands calloused but gentle, pushed open the heavy oak door to the drawing-room, a gust of stale, perfumed air rushing out to greet her. Dust motes danced in the single ray of sunlight slicing through the grime on the bay window, illuminating a scene frozen in time: an overflowing teacup perched precariously on a mahogany side table, a half-finished embroidery project draped over a velvet armchair, a dog-eared copy of Jane Eyre lying open on a chaise lounge. Eloise sighed, her breath fogging the cool air for just a moment before being snatched away by a phantom breeze. 

It had been three months since Mrs. Haverford had taken ill, and the once vibrant mansion now lay shrouded in an unsettling silence. Eloise, who had been employed here for fifteen years, knew every nook and cranny of the sprawling Victorian home, every whisper of its history echoing through the empty hallways. Today, however, something felt different. The air vibrated with a strange tension, a subtle shift that prickled at the back of her neck. As she began dusting the intricately carved mantelpiece, Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that she wasn't alone.
