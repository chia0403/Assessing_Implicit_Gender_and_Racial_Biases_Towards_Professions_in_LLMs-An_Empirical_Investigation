Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzwilliam's tiny office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into an impressionistic smear. Bart sighed, running a hand through his thinning hair. Spreadsheets sprawled across his desk like forgotten maps of a lost world – a world where numbers made sense and balance sheets held order. But tonight, the only order Bart could find was in the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of rain against glass, a monotonous counterpoint to the relentless ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. 

His office, nestled above Mrs. Miggins' bakery on Bleecker Street, wasn't much, but it was all he had. The scent of yeast and sugar wafted up from below, a faint reminder of a simpler life, before his wife left and his accounting firm folded under the weight of the recession. Now, Bart eked out a living auditing small businesses, mostly bodegas and laundromats, their ledgers as messy and unpredictable as the storm raging outside. 


Tonight's client was no exception. A crumpled folder labeled "Rosie's Pizzeria" lay open on his desk, its contents a chaotic jumble of receipts scribbled on napkins and invoices written in languages Bart couldn't decipher. He wasn't sure what Rosie had been cooking up lately, but it smelled like trouble.

And then there was the phone call, the one that had come just before the storm hit – an anonymous voice whispering about hidden accounts and missing funds.  Bart pushed the thought away, focusing on the familiar comfort of numbers, but a nagging feeling told him Rosie's Pizzeria might be more than just a simple audit. This time, he suspected, the numbers were hiding a story far more complicated than a few misplaced cents.
