Sweat beaded on Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's brow as she mirrored the lunges her Zumba class was performing, a smile plastered across her face despite the throbbing in her quads. The bass pulsed through the studio floor, shaking the fluorescent lights overhead and sending a vibrant energy rippling through the room.  Amy's ponytail swung like a metronome, keeping time with the Latin rhythms as she encouraged her students to "feel the beat!"

The air was thick with exertion and the scent of coconut-scented deodorant. Outside, the late summer sun beat down on the bustling city streets of Austin, Texas. But in this mirrored sanctuary, it was all about letting loose, releasing stress, and finding joy in movement. Amy loved watching her students transform â€“ from hesitant beginners to confident dancers, their faces beaming with endorphin-fueled smiles. Today, however, something felt different. A knot of unease twisted in her stomach, a feeling she couldn't quite shake off.

Suddenly, the music cut out, plunging the studio into an unsettling silence.  Amy froze mid-lunge, confusion rippling through the class as they looked around at each other.
