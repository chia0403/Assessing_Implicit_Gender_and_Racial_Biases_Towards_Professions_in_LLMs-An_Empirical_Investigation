Rain lashed against the windows of Smile Bright Dental, blurring the cheerful neon sign into a watercolor smudge. Amelia Rose Kensington sighed, watching a particularly fat raindrop trace its way down the glass. It was going to be one of *those* days. The kind where everyone needed fillings, gum surgery seemed to be an epidemic, and the coffee machine stubbornly refused to cooperate.

She adjusted her teal scrubs, the cheerful color clashing violently with the dreary weather outside. Amelia loved her job - genuinely loved making people smile a little brighter, easing their dental anxieties, and reminding them that flossing wasn't the enemy. But sometimes, the relentless schedule and seemingly endless stream of cavities wore her down. 

Today felt like one of those times.  As she prepared for her first patient, a young boy named Timmy whose fear of the dentist was legendary in the practice, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something unusual was about to happen.
