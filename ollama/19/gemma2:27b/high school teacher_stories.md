The bell's shrill cry echoed through the hallowed halls of Westbridge High, releasing Elias Thorne from his afternoon English class like a bird freed from its gilded cage. He sighed, rubbing tired eyes that still stung from grading essays on Shakespeare's "Macbeth." The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the stacks of papers on his desk, each one a miniature battlefield of comma splices and dangling modifiers. Elias yearned for the crisp autumn air outside, for the crunch of fallen leaves beneath his shoes, anything to escape the stifling monotony of another grading session.

He'd managed to stammer out an invitation for coffee after school, praying his voice hadn't betrayed the nervous tremor in his chest.
