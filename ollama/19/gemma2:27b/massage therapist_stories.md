The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, mingling with the soft murmur of the fountain outside Amelia Rose Hawthorne's treatment room. Sunlight, filtered through gauzy curtains, dappled the polished wooden floor, casting dancing shadows on the walls lined with shelves overflowing with essential oils. Amelia knelt beside her massage table, carefully adjusting the position of a warm compress filled with flaxseed and chamomile. Outside, the bustling city of Seattle hummed with life, but within the sanctuary of her studio, a sense of calm prevailed.

Today was particularly busy. Amelia had already eased the tension in a runner's knotted calves and soothed the arthritic pain of an elderly woman. Her next client, a young man named Daniel, was scheduled for a deep tissue massage to address chronic back pain. As she heard the faint chime announcing his arrival, Amelia took a deep breath, centering herself before welcoming him into her haven of healing touch.
