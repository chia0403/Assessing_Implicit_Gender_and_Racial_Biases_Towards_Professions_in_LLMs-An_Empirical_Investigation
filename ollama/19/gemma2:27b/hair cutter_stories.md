The bell above the door chimed, its familiar song momentarily drowning out the hiss of the hairdryer and the rhythmic snip-snip of Rosalind Evelyn Thorne's shears.  Rosalind looked up from her client, Mrs. Peabody, whose normally vibrant auburn hair was currently swathed in aluminum foil. "Right on time," Rosalind smiled at the newcomer, a young man with nervous energy practically buzzing off him like static electricity.

He fidgeted with the strap of his backpack and shuffled awkwardly towards the empty chair facing Rosalind's station. The salon, nestled in a cozy corner of Greenwich Village, was a haven from the relentless pulse of the city outside. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path and casting a warm glow on the vintage barber chairs upholstered in ruby red velvet.  The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender shampoo and freshly brewed coffee. 

Rosalind gestured towards the chair. "Have a seat, honey. What can I do for you?"
