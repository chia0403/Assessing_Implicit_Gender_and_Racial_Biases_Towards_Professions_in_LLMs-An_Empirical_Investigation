The air hung heavy with the scent of vanilla and sugar, a comforting blanket Amelia "Em" Hawthorne knew by heart. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the dusty street, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves. But inside Em's bakery, Sweet Surrender, it was a haven of cool, sugary bliss. Sunlight filtered through the storefront window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the meticulously crafted cakes displayed in the glass case. Each one was a miniature masterpiece: a three-tiered lavender buttercream dream adorned with delicate sugar flowers, a whimsical woodland scene sculpted entirely out of chocolate, and a gravity-defying red velvet cake perched precariously on a stack of books, defying all logic and gravity.

Em surveyed her work with satisfaction. Today's orders were for a baby shower (pastel pink roses on white fondant), a graduation party (chocolate sheet cake shaped like a mortarboard) and a whimsical birthday cake featuring a dragon sculpted from marzipan. But even amidst the flurry of activity, Em couldn't shake off a lingering sense of unease. The familiar buzz of anticipation for the day ahead was muted, replaced by a prickling sensation at the back of her neck. Something felt...off.
