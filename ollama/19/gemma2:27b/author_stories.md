The rain hammered against the attic window, a frantic drummer urging Amelia Thistlewick to stay inside. But Amelia, her fingers stained with ink and her mind buzzing with a plot twist that had just slammed into her like a runaway train, couldn't be deterred. She yanked open the warped wooden window, letting in a blast of cold, damp air and the scent of rain-soaked cobblestones. Below, the gaslights of Edinburgh flickered weakly against the relentless storm. 

Amelia was on the precipice. Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the crumbling ruins of an ancient Scottish abbey, had stalled. The villain, a shadowy figure with a penchant for poisoned sweets and cryptic riddles, needed a motive. A truly compelling one.  She'd been wrestling with it for weeks, her usual fountain of inspiration dried up like a forgotten well. 

But tonight, something was different. The storm seemed to whisper secrets, the wind carrying echoes of forgotten tragedies. Amelia inhaled deeply, bracing herself against the biting air. "Give me a clue," she whispered to the night.  "Something, anything."
