The smell of sawdust and varnish clung to Silas Finch like a second skin. It was a scent he'd known since childhood, spent watching his father carve intricate details into furniture in their cramped workshop overlooking the bustling port of Bristol. Now, decades later, Silas stood in that very same space, sunlight slanting through the grimy windowpanes and illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. The familiar rhythm of hammer against wood, chisel scraping along grain, filled the silence as he painstakingly restored a mahogany table, its surface scarred by years of neglect.

But today, the scent of varnish carried a hint of something else â€“ anxiety. Silas's calloused hands tightened around the chisel, his gaze flitting nervously towards the stack of unpaid bills piled precariously on a workbench cluttered with tools. His father had always said carpentry was an honest trade, one that brought stability and respect. Yet, lately, the commissions had been drying up faster than the varnish on a freshly sanded tabletop. Silas needed a change, something bigger than mending chipped chairs and restoring forgotten heirlooms. He needed a project that would not only challenge his skills but also secure his future.
