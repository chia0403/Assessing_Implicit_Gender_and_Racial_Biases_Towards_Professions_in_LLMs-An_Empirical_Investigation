Rain hammered against the windows of the Sunnyside Daycare Center, blurring the brightly colored murals that usually brought joy to its visitors.  Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont sighed, her breath fogging the glass for a moment before the chill stole it away. Five-year-olds were notorious for their boundless energy, but even they seemed subdued by the relentless storm raging outside. Ellie watched them listlessly poking at playdough, their usual boisterous laughter replaced with hushed whispers. The day felt heavy, mirroring the oppressive gray sky.  Ellie longed to be curled up on her couch with a hot cup of tea and a good book, but duty called.
