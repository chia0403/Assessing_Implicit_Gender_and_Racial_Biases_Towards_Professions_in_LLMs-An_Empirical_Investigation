The flickering fluorescent lights cast elongated shadows across the linoleum floor, each swipe of Elias Bartholomew's mop echoing like a mournful sigh in the cavernous silence of the abandoned science lab. Dust motes danced in the pale luminescence, swirling around beakers filled with murky solutions and Bunsen burners coated in a thick layer of grime. Outside, a storm raged, whipping rain against the grimy windows and sending an occasional shiver through the building's aging bones. Elias, his thin frame hunched beneath the weight of a overflowing trash bag, paused, listening to the wind howl like a tormented beast.

Tonight, it felt different. An unsettling hum vibrated beneath his feet, a low frequency thrum that pulsed in sync with the storm outside. Elias hesitated, glancing nervously at the rows of sealed cabinets, each one holding secrets he wasn't meant to uncover.
