The humid Charleston air clung to Amelia "Amy" Beaumont like a second skin as she climbed the rickety porch steps of the Queen Anne Victorian.  Sunlight glinted off the peeling paint, revealing faded turquoise and ochre beneath layers of neglect. Wisteria vines, once meticulously pruned, now clawed at the windows, their purple blooms wilting in the oppressive heat. Amy sighed, adjusting her straw hat and smoothing down her linen dress. This house, with its crumbling grandeur and air of forgotten elegance, was a testament to both Charleston's allure and its decay.

It wasn't the kind of listing she usually handled – Amy specialized in sleek condos overlooking the Battery and charming historic cottages in the French Quarter. But this property, shrouded in whispers and local legend, had piqued her interest. The previous owners, the Caldwell family, had vanished without a trace decades ago, leaving behind an empty house with untold secrets. 

Amy's phone buzzed in her pocket - it was her boss, reminding her about the open house that afternoon. A shiver ran down her spine as she reached for the rusted doorknob, feeling a strange mix of anticipation and unease. This wasn't just another sale; it felt like stepping into a forgotten story, one that might be waiting to be told… or retold.
