The humid air hung thick in the salon, smelling faintly of burnt hair and lavender shampoo. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing above the rows of mismatched chairs.  Eloise Marie Davenport expertly swirled her brush through Mrs. Henderson's silver curls, humming along to the tinny rendition of "Dancing Queen" crackling from the ancient boombox tucked precariously on a shelf. Eloise loved this part of her day – the familiar routine, the comforting scent of hairspray, and the gentle rhythm of gossip exchanged between client and stylist. It was a world she understood, a world where transformations happened not just with scissors and dye, but with genuine connection.

But today, something felt off.  A tremor ran through Eloise's hand as she finished Mrs. Henderson's set, a prickle of unease settling in the pit of her stomach. It wasn’t the usual pre-weekend exhaustion; it was something deeper, something she couldn't quite put her finger on.
