The biting wind whipped around Elara Thorne's face, stinging her cheeks red despite the thick woolen scarf wrapped around her neck. The iron gates groaned in protest as she pushed them open wider, the rusted hinges screaming like a tortured beast. Beyond lay the winding path leading up to Castle Blackwood, its silhouette jagged against the bruised twilight sky.

Elara tightened her grip on the heavy iron mace strapped to her side, its weight familiar and comforting. Tonight was different. A palpable tension crackled in the air, heavier than the fog rolling in from the moor. The whispers of rebellion had reached even this remote outpost, carried on the wind alongside the scent of rain and woodsmoke. She could feel it in the way the crows cawed with unsettling urgency overhead, in the hunched shoulders of the fellow guards huddled around their meager fire, their eyes darting nervously towards the looming castle.

Something was coming. Elara knew it in her bones.
