Grease clung to Elara Reyes's fingertips like stubborn cobwebs, refusing to be dislodged by the relentless scrubbing of her calloused hands. The harsh fluorescent lights of Reyes Auto Repair cast long shadows across the cluttered workshop floor, highlighting the labyrinthine network of tools and spare parts that Elara navigated with practiced ease. Outside, a late summer sun beat down on the dusty asphalt lot, baking the already sweltering air inside the shop. A symphony of cicadas thrummed through the open garage door, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of her wrench against a stubborn bolt.

She wasn't complaining â€“ she loved the challenge, the intricate dance between human ingenuity and mechanical precision. But even she, with years of experience under her belt, was starting to feel the strain.
