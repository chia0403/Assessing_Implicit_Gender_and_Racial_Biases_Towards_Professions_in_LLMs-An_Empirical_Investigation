Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Ms. Evelyn Blackwoodâ€™s office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Stacks of student files threatened to topple over on her cluttered desk, each one representing another heart she was struggling to mend.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn posters plastered across the walls: "Be Your Best Self!" and "Reach for the Stars!". Evelyn doubted those slogans held much weight for most of her students at Northwood High, a school nestled in the rust belt town of Harmonyville, where dreams often withered under the weight of poverty and despair.

Today's appointment was with Daniel Hayes, a quiet boy who had been slipping through the cracks all year. He hadn't failed any classes yet, but his grades were plummeting, and he rarely spoke in class. Evelyn knew something was wrong, she just needed to figure out what key would unlock his silence.
