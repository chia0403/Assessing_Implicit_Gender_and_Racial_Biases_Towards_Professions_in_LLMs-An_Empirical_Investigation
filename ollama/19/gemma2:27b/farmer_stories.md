The wind whistled a mournful tune through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak, its leaves long since surrendered to autumn's icy grip. Silas Thaddeus Blackwood squinted at the leaden sky, the first flakes of snow already dancing on the biting breeze. He adjusted his threadbare woolen cap and pulled his shawl tighter around his broad shoulders, the rough fabric scratching against his sun-weathered skin.

Silas surveyed his fields with a sigh. The once vibrant rows of corn now stood withered and brown, their husks flapping listlessly in the wind. Winter had come early this year, an unwelcome guest that threatened to steal what little harvest remained. He needed to gather the last of the pumpkins, their orange globes promising sweetness amidst the encroaching desolation.  

But Silas felt a gnawing unease in his gut, deeper than the usual worry about a harsh winter. It had been three days since he'd seen anyone from the neighboring farms, not even young Thomas with his mischievous grin and boundless energy. The silence was unnerving, broken only by the mournful cry of the wind and the distant cawing of crows.
