Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Pill & Quill Pharmacy," blurring the neon OPEN sign into a swirling mess of red and blue. Inside, Emilia Blackwood, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, meticulously counted out capsules of oxycodone. The rhythmic click-clack of pills against glass was a familiar counterpoint to the symphony of coughs and sniffles that echoed from the waiting area.

It wasn't exactly glamorous work, but Emilia found solace in the predictability of it all. Each prescription, each interaction with a patient â€“ it felt like a tiny thread woven into the fabric of her community. Still, tonight felt different. A prickling unease snaked up her spine as she glanced at the clock: 10:57 pm. Closing time was long passed, and yet, a lone figure remained seated in the corner, shrouded in shadows.  

Emilia's intuition screamed danger. Who would be waiting this late, especially on a night like this? The man hadn't moved since arriving an hour ago, his face obscured by the wide brim of a fedora. He exuded a stillness that was unnervingly intense, like a predator coiled and ready to strike.
