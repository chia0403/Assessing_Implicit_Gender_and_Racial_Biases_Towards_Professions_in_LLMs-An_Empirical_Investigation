The pungent aroma of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Rose Donovan's scrubs like a second skin. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the adobe walls of Casa de Esperanza, but inside the therapy room, the air conditioning hummed a constant, cool symphony. Amelia adjusted the straps on her patient’s leg brace, wincing as she felt the familiar ache in her own shoulder. Years of guiding limbs back to strength had taken their toll, but the glimmer of hope in her patient's eyes made it all worthwhile. 

Today was different, though. A palpable tension crackled through the room, a stark contrast to the usual atmosphere of healing and progress. Amelia glanced at the clock – 2:47 pm – precisely the time she’d been told to expect him. He was supposed to be her new patient, a retired athlete with a mysterious injury shrouded in whispers and speculation.  

The door creaked open, revealing a tall figure silhouetted against the harsh desert light. Amelia straightened, her heart thumping a nervous tattoo against her ribs. This wasn't just any patient. This was Rafael “El Toro” Torres, the legendary bull rider whose career had been cut short by an accident shrouded in whispers and rumors.
