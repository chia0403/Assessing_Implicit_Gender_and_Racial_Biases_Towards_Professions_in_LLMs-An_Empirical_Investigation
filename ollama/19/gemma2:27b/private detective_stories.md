Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the 'Lucky Dragon' bar sign across the street. Inside his cramped office, Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood tapped a rhythm on his desk with a chewed-up pen, the only sound breaking the monotonous drumming of the rain. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation â€“ a familiar cocktail in Teddy's line of work.

He glanced at the clock: 10:47 pm.  Another night fading into the murky dawn, another case left unsolved. A crumpled photograph lay on his desk, depicting a young woman with eyes as bright as sapphires. Amelia Brighton. Missing for three weeks, vanished without a trace. Teddy had followed every lead, interrogated every shady character who crossed his path, but Amelia remained an elusive ghost, haunting his thoughts like the incessant rain outside.


He knew time was running out. Amelia's family was losing hope, and Teddy couldn't bear to see them crushed under the weight of despair. He needed a break, something, anything, to crack this case wide open before it slipped away forever.
