Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Salty Dog pub, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an anemic smear. Penelope "Penny" Blackwood, her trench coat dripping onto the threadbare carpet, pushed open the heavy wooden door, the scent of stale beer and fried onions hitting her like a warm, greasy hug. She scanned the dimly lit room, its usual clientele – fishermen with weather-beaten faces, dockworkers with calloused hands, and tourists seeking a taste of "authentic" seaside life – huddled around tables, their voices hushed against the storm's roar.

Penny, her notebook tucked under her arm and a determined glint in her hazel eyes, made her way to the bar, where Old Man Finnigan, the pub's gruff but kind-hearted owner, was polishing glasses with a rag that had seen better days. He looked up, his bushy eyebrows furrowing as he recognized Penny.


"Back for more trouble, are we?" he grumbled, his voice gravelly with years of sea salt and whisky.

Penny smiled, her eyes twinkling with mischief. "Just trying to uncover the truth, Finnigan. Heard there's a story brewing in this town."
