Rain lashed against the bus windows, blurring the already misty panorama of the Scottish Highlands. Amelia Sutherland, her ginger hair plastered to her forehead, sighed. This was not how she envisioned her first tour as a fully-fledged guide for Highland Wanderer Tours. The brochure promised breathtaking views of Loch Ness and majestic mountains, but all she saw were grey clouds and wind-battered heather.

She adjusted her microphone, its crackle momentarily competing with the symphony of rain, and forced a cheerful tone. "Welcome, everyone," she began, her voice echoing through the bus. "Despite the weather taking a rather dramatic turn, I assure you we're in for a truly unforgettable experienceâ€¦"


Amelia trailed off, unsure if her optimism would convince even herself. The faces reflected back at her were a mixture of weary travellers and expectant tourists, their expressions mirroring the dreary landscape outside. This was supposed to be the trip of a lifetime, showcasing the raw beauty and mythical allure of Scotland. But right now, it felt more like a soggy pilgrimage through endless grey.

Could Amelia salvage this day and deliver the experience she promised? The answer, hidden somewhere beneath the rolling hills and swirling mist, awaited her.
