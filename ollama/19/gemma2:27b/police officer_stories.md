Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Precinct 47, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into an impressionistic smear. Detective Elias "Eli" Thorne stared out at the deluge, the rhythmic thumping mirroring the dull ache in his temples. Three days. Three goddamn days he'd been stuck on this missing persons case, a woman vanished from her apartment with nothing but a half-eaten bowl of cereal and a cryptic note left on the counter: "Gone to find myself."

Eli scoffed. Easier said than done, especially in a city like New Haven, where finding yourself often meant getting swallowed whole by its underbelly. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. A crumpled file lay open on his desk, overflowing with witness statements and dead-end leads. He rubbed his tired eyes, wishing for a break, for something – anything – to crack this case wide open.
