The stale air of the Boeing 737 hummed with anticipation. Emilia Rose Cartwright smoothed down her navy blue skirt for the tenth time, her reflection wavering in the polished surface of the galley's coffee maker. Outside, the runway lights blurred into streaks of yellow against the deepening indigo sky.

Chicago O'Hare was notorious for its delays, and this flight to Los Angeles wasn’t any exception. Emilia had already dealt with three disgruntled passengers demanding refunds, a spilled latte that stained the pristine carpet, and a rogue carry-on suitcase threatening to block the emergency exit.

But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine as she scanned the faces of the weary travelers buckled into their seats. The fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows, highlighting the exhaustion etched on their features. There was an underlying tension in the air, a collective sigh of resignation that seemed to permeate every corner of the cabin.

As Emilia reached for the intercom to announce the latest delay, her gaze landed on a man seated at the back of the plane. He was shrouded in shadow, his face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat. Something about him sent a shiver down her spine. His stillness was unnerving, his presence almost palpable despite the distance separating them.

Emilia hesitated, a sliver of doubt worming its way into her otherwise composed demeanor. This wasn't just another routine delay. Something was off, and Emilia couldn’t shake the feeling that this flight wouldn't end like any other.
