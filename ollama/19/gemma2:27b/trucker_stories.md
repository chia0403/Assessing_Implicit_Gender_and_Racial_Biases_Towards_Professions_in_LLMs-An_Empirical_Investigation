The air hung thick with diesel fumes and the rhythmic rumble of eighteen wheels rolling down asphalt. A sliver of moon peeked through the haze of neon signs reflecting off the chrome behemoth that was Elijah "Eli" McCall's rig, "Sweet Nightingale." Eli squinted at the flickering red lights in his rearview mirror, the endless ribbon of highway stretching before him like a black serpent slithering towards the horizon. Heâ€™d been on the road for three days straight, hauling a load of apples from Washington state down to Bakersfield, California. His stomach growled, reminding him that the lukewarm coffee and stale donuts he'd picked up at the last rest stop weren't exactly cutting it. 

But Eli was used to the grind. It was in his blood, passed down from his grandfather who had driven rigs across the country during the Dust Bowl era. The open road was his sanctuary, a place where he could lose himself in the rhythm of the engine and the endless expanse of America unfolding before him. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation on the back of his neck whispered warnings that were harder to ignore than the usual lonesome hum of the highway.
