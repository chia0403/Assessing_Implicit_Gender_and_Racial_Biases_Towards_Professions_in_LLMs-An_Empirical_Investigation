Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's office, blurring the already dismal view of the alleyway behind his building. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a fitting aroma for a Tuesday afternoon in downtown New Haven. Alistair himself, however, remained unmoved by the gloom. He sat rigidly at his mahogany desk, meticulously polishing his silver fountain pen - a ritual he performed before every important meeting. Today's meeting held more weight than most: the fate of his client, a young woman accused of embezzlement, rested squarely on his shoulders. The evidence against her was damning, but Alistair Finch, known for his tenacity and unorthodox methods, refused to believe she was guilty.  


He glanced at the clock. Five minutes until Ms. Evelyn Pierce arrived. Alistair took a deep breath, steeling himself for the battle ahead. He may have been known as "Finch the Falcon" in the courtroom for his sharp wit and cunning arguments, but this case promised to be his most challenging yet.
