Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the rickety shed, drowning out Coach Elijah "Eli" Thompson's words. He stared out at his team huddled on the muddy field, their shoulders slumped under the weight of another loss. The scoreboard glared back at them: 35-0. Another shut-out.

Eli chewed on his lip, the metallic tang of blood a familiar sensation these days. Coaching the Dust Devils, the underdog football team of dusty, forgotten Harmony Creek, wasn't for the faint of heart. Their field resembled a moonscape more than a gridiron, their equipment held together with prayers and duct tape, and their opponents, the well-funded teams from neighboring towns, treated them like an annual charity case. 

But Eli believed in these kids. He saw the spark in their eyes, the hunger for something better. And he wasn't about to let a little rain, or a few crushing defeats, extinguish that flame.  

He took a deep breath and clapped his hands together, the sound amplified by the silence. "Alright, Dust Devils," he boomed, his voice gravelly with determination. "Let's go inside. We've got work to do."
