The rhythmic snip-snip of shears echoed through Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's barbershop, punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter from his regulars clustered around the worn leather chairs. Bart's Barbershop was more than just a place to get a haircut; it was the heartbeat of Oakhaven, a small town nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering willows. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air, while the scent of bay rum mingled with pipe tobacco, creating a uniquely comforting aroma. Bart himself, a man weathered by time but with eyes that sparkled like freshly polished chrome, expertly maneuvered his shears around Mr. Henderson's head, weaving tales of local gossip and legend between snips. 


Today, however, an unfamiliar tension hung in the air. A stranger had walked into Bart's shop just as the clock chimed eleven, a tall figure cloaked in a heavy woolen coat despite the summer sun. He hadn't spoken a word, simply sat down in an empty chair and fixed his piercing blue eyes on Bart, making him feel strangely uneasy.

This was no ordinary customer. Bart could sense it.
