The air hung thick with the metallic scent of blood, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Bart" Grimshaw. His cleaver, worn smooth from years of service, gleamed dully under the single bulb that illuminated his cramped backroom. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Grimhaven were bustling with morning life, but here, in the cool dimness, Bart was alone with the carcass of a boar, its glazed eyes staring blankly at the ceiling.

Grimhaven was no stranger to hardship. Nestled amidst rolling hills and shadowed forests, it had always relied on the bounty of the land for survival. Bart's butcher shop, "Grimshaw's Provisions," was a cornerstone of the community, providing sustenance in lean times and celebration meats for joyous occasions. But lately, something had changed. The hunts had been meagre, the livestock sickly, and whispers of a curse spreading through the woods chilled even Bart's pragmatic heart.
