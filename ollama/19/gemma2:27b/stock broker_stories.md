The air in Elias Blackwood's office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the neon canyons of Manhattan pulsed with a manic energy that mirrored the frenzy unfolding on his computer screens. Numbers danced before him, an indecipherable ballet of green and red, each tick signifying potential profit or catastrophic loss. Elias, a man whose tailored suits concealed a constant state of barely suppressed anxiety, chewed nervously on his thumbnail as he stared at the plummeting price of XYZ Corp. 

He had convinced his biggest client, Mrs. Van Derlyn, an elderly woman with more money than sense, to pour her entire life savings into this "sure thing," and now it was crumbling before him like a sandcastle in a hurricane. Elias knew he had made a mistake, a reckless gamble driven by the insatiable hunger for a bigger bonus and the fear of being left behind in the cutthroat world of Wall Street. But facing Mrs. Van Derlyn's disappointed gaze – an image that haunted his nightmares – was a prospect far more terrifying than any market crash.
