The humid Savannah air clung to Evelyn Marie Dupont like a second skin as she wrestled with Mrs. Clementine's impossibly thick curls.  "Just a trim, Evelyn," the octogenarian had insisted, but her definition of "trim" seemed to be closer to a complete overhaul. Evelyn sighed internally, maneuvering the shears through the cloud of white hair. Outside the window of Dupont's Hair Haven, Spanish moss swayed languidly from the ancient oak trees that lined Drayton Street. The scent of jasmine and magnolias drifted in, momentarily masking the chemical tang of perm solution. 

Evelyn loved Savannah, with its cobblestone streets and antebellum architecture, but she sometimes felt stifled by its slow pace. She longed for adventure, a chance to break free from the predictable rhythm of snip, shampoo, repeat. But for now, Mrs. Clementine's insistent chatter about her prize-winning hydrangeas filled the space.
