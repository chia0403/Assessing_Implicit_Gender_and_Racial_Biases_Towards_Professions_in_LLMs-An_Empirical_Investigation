The rusted clang of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' wrench against an ancient pipe echoed through the cramped bathroom like a mournful church bell. The air hung thick with the stench of mildew and despair, punctuated by the occasional drip-drip-drip from the stubbornly leaking faucet. Bart squinted at the mess of corroded copper and iron before him, mentally cursing the previous homeowner who'd clearly attempted a DIY fix that ended in utter disaster. 

He was deep in the bowels of a crumbling Victorian mansion on the outskirts of Salem, Massachusetts. The house, a sprawling monument to faded grandeur, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the town. Its peeling paint and overgrown ivy whispered tales of forgotten elegance and long-buried secrets. Bart, with his calloused hands and grease-stained overalls, was an unlikely hero in this gothic setting, but he was used to it. 

He'd seen enough leaky faucets, clogged toilets, and burst pipes to know that even the grandest houses were susceptible to the mundane woes of plumbing. And while Bart wasn't a man prone to fanciful thoughts, there was something about this house - its eerie silence, its shadowy corners - that prickled his skin with an unfamiliar sense of unease.
