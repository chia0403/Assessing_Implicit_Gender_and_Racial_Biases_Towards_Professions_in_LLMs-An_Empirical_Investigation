Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the interrogation room, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. ElizaBeth Thorne. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the steel table and two mismatched chairs facing each other. Across from her sat Marcus Hayes, his hands clenched tightly in his lap, eyes darting nervously around the room. He was a young man, barely twenty-five, with a gaunt face etched with worry lines that seemed too deep for his age. 

ElizaBeth, renowned for her ability to see through facades and into the darkest corners of the human psyche, felt a familiar tingle of anticipation mixed with trepidation. Marcus Hayes wasn't just any suspect; he was the prime witness in a case that had gripped the city - the brutal murder of prominent philanthropist Amelia Blackwood. 

ElizaBeth took a deep breath, her gaze steady and unwavering as she met Marcus's anxious stare. "Mr. Hayes," she began, her voice calm yet laced with an undeniable authority, "tell me again what you saw on the night of Ms. Blackwood's death."
