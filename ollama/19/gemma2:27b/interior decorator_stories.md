The insistent chime of Eliza Cavendish's phone jolted her awake, the pale light filtering through her gauzy curtains painting strange stripes across the room. Groaning, she fumbled for the device on her bedside table, squinting at the unfamiliar number flashing on the screen.

"Eliza Cavendish speaking," she mumbled into the receiver, her voice thick with sleep. 

A crisp, authoritative voice replied, "Ms. Cavendish, I hope I'm not disturbing you. My name is Alistair Thornton, and I represent Mr. Theodore Blackwood. He's looking for someone to oversee the renovation of his historic townhouse in Notting Hill."

Eliza sat up abruptly, her drowsiness replaced by a surge of interest. Notting Hill? A historic townhouse? This wasn't some run-of-the-mill apartment makeover; this was a chance to work with history, with grandeur.  

"Mr. Thornton," she said, her voice regaining its usual vibrancy, "tell me everything." 


The setting: Eliza Cavendish’s cozy London flat in the heart of trendy Shoreditch. It's a haven of curated chaos – overflowing bookshelves crammed with design tomes and art history texts, stacks of fabric swatches spilling onto antique velvet sofas, and walls adorned with quirky vintage prints.

Eliza is surrounded by the tools of her trade: sketches scattered on her drafting table, paint chips organized in rainbow order, and a battered laptop displaying digital mood boards. The scent of Earl Grey tea hangs in the air, mingling with the faint fragrance of beeswax polish from the antique chest she's restoring.
