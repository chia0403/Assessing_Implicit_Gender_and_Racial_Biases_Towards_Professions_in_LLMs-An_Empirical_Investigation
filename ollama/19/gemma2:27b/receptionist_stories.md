The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright's desk. Her neatly manicured nails tapped against the worn surface, keeping time with the insistent ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner. Outside, rain lashed against the large plate-glass windows, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic watercolour. It was one of those dreary November days that seemed to seep into your bones and leave you feeling perpetually damp.

Evelyn sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair back behind her ear. As the receptionist for Blackwood & Sons, a prestigious but somewhat antiquated law firm, she spent most of her days fielding calls from irate clients, scheduling appointments, and trying desperately to decipher Mr. Blackwood's scrawled handwriting on interoffice memos.

Today, however, promised something different. A manila envelope, addressed in elegant calligraphy and bearing no return address, had arrived earlier that morning. Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that it held something extraordinary, something that might shatter the monotony of her everyday existence.
