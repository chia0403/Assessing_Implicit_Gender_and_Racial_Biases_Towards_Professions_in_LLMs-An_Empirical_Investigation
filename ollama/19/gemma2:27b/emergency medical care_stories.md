Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city into an impressionistic smear. Inside, Elias Finch, his brow furrowed in concentration, checked the vitals on the monitor beside him. The rhythmic beep was reassuring, a counterpoint to the frantic symphony playing outside. A young woman lay strapped to the gurney, pale and still, her chest rising and falling shallowly with each breath. She’d been found unconscious in an alleyway, the victim of what looked like a brutal assault.

Elias, a seasoned EMT with eyes that held both weariness and fierce compassion, knew time was critical. Every second counted as he worked to stabilize her, his movements practiced and precise. The sirens wailed, a mournful chorus cutting through the storm, urging them onward toward the sanctuary of St. Jude’s Hospital. Elias braced himself for the battle ahead, praying that this young woman would pull through the night.
