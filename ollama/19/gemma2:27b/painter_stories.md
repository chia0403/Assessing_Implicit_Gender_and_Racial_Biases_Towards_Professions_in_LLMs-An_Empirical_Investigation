Her easel stood precariously on the windswept clifftop, threatening to topple over with every gust that whipped around them. Elara barely noticed. For years, she had sought this wild beauty, this untamed landscape that mirrored the storm brewing within her own soul. Today, she was determined to capture it, not just the physical spectacle but the raw emotion it evoked.
