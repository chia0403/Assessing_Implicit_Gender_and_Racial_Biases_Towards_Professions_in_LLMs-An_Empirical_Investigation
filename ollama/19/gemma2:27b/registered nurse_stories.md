The incessant hum of the fluorescent lights grated on Elara Genevieve Dubois's nerves as she shuffled through the endless hallways of St. Jude's Hospital.  Even after five years in this place, the smell of antiseptic and despair still clung to her like a second skin. The late afternoon sunlight, filtering weakly through the grimy windows, cast long shadows that danced menacingly across the linoleum floor.

Elara paused outside room 312, her hand hovering hesitantly over the knob. Inside lay Mrs. Henderson, a woman battling stage four lung cancer with a tenacity that both inspired and exhausted Elara. Tonight, she had requested Elara specifically.  Something in the woman's tired eyes, the way her frail hand clutched the worn teddy bear on her bedside table – it tugged at Elara’s heartstrings, reminding her why she chose this profession despite its relentless toll. 

Taking a deep breath, Elara steeled herself and pushed open the door.
