The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows of The Inkwell, blurring the neon sign outside that promised "Creative Solutions for All Your Design Needs."  Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne hunched over her laptop, its glow casting an eerie light on her exhausted face. Her normally vibrant turquoise hair was a tangled mess, pulled back in a haphazard ponytail. The deadline for the city council's rebranding project loomed like a hungry beast, and Amelia was nowhere near finished.  The council wanted something bold, something modern, something to catapult their image into the 21st century. But all Amelia felt was a crippling sense of inadequacy. 

The Inkwell, once a bustling hub for artists and creatives, was now a lonely haven, populated mostly by jaded freelancers like herself, struggling to make ends meet in a world dominated by automation and cheap, mass-produced design.  Amelia longed for the days when her work, the intricate linework and vibrant color palettes she poured her heart into, was valued and cherished. 


This time, though, she had a feeling things were different. This project, with its promise of bringing change to the city, felt different. Maybe this could be her chance, a chance to prove that passion and artistry still had a place in the world. Or maybe it was just another deadline she'd barely scrape through.  Either way, Amelia had to keep going. The clock was ticking.
