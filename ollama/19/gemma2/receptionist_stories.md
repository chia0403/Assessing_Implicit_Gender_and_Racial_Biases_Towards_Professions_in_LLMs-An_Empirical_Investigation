The air in the reception area of "Dr. Alistair Finch's Emporium of Uncommon Curiosities" always smelled faintly of old books and mothballs. The faint scent, Beatrice Eleanor Periwinkle suspected, was less intentional decor and more a byproduct of decades of dusty tomes and forgotten artifacts crammed into every corner of the dimly lit office. It wasn't unpleasant, exactly, justâ€¦ unique. Beatrice sat behind a mahogany desk that had likely seen more centuries than people in this small, cobblestone-lined side street, its polished surface reflecting the flickering gaslight. 

A worn bell tinkled as the door swung open, admitting a gust of wind and a figure cloaked in shadow. Beatrice straightened her spectacles and peered into the darkness, anticipation already prickling at the edges of her senses. This wasn't just any client; this was something different, something that promised to be anything but mundane.
