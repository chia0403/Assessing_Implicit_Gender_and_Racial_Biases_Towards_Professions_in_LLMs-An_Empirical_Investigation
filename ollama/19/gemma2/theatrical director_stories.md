The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and burnt hairspray, a familiar perfume in the subterranean belly of The Phoenix Theatre. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mimicking the frantic drumming of Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's heart. She paced back and forth across the cluttered rehearsal space, her signature red boots thudding on the cracked linoleum floor.  

Eleanor was known for two things: her fiercely independent spirit and her ability to coax magic from the most unassuming actors. Tonight, however, even her usual theatrical charm felt thin. Her latest production, a gritty adaptation of "Macbeth" set in a decaying Victorian mansion, was on the brink of collapse. The leading actress had just stormed off stage, claiming Ellie's direction was "psychologically damaging," and the remaining cast looked like a pack of nervous dogs, unsure if they should bark or cower. 

The storm outside raged on, mirroring the tempest brewing within Eleanor Beaumont. Her heart pounded against her ribs, a frantic metronome counting down to the inevitable disaster that seemed to be unfolding before her very eyes.


This was it. The moment where Ellie's dreams of theatrical grandeur could crumble into dust.
