The rhythmic whir of clippers filled Elara Beatrice Blackwood's small salon, a comforting counterpoint to the chaotic hum of the city just outside. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, casting long shadows across the mismatched furniture and the array of vibrant hair products lining the shelves. It was Tuesday afternoon, usually Elara's slowest time. The city folk were busy at work or tucked away in their apartments, dreaming of escaping the midday heat. But today, Elara felt a prickle of anticipation. 


She glanced at the appointment book, flipping to the page marked "New Clients." There, nestled between a Mrs. Henderson requesting her usual trim and Mr. Thompson's desperate need for a beard tidy-up, was a single name: Jasper Thorne. No previous appointments, no notes about hair type or style preferences. Just a name that sent a shiver down Elara's spine, a name she knew from the hushed whispers of gossip in this tightly-knit neighborhood. 


A whisper, she thought, might be all it took to unravel everything. And Jasper Thorne was here to bring the storm.
