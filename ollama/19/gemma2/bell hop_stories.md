The Grand Budapest Hotel was never truly quiet. Even at 3:00 AM, when the moon hung like a pale, jealous eye in the velvet sky and the city outside slumbered, there was always a subtle hum. The rhythmic click of heels on polished marble from an unseen guest pacing their suite, the distant murmur of the kitchen staff prepping for breakfast, the gentle clinking of glasses from the bar where Monsieur Gustave, the hotel's iconic concierge, lingered long after closing. 

This was Theodore "Theo" Beaumont's domain.  As a young bell hop, he navigated these familiar corridors with practiced grace, his movements as silent and precise as the grandfather clock in the lobby. He knew every guest by their preferred breakfast order, every staff member by their rhythm of footsteps, and every inch of the hotel like the back of his hand. The Grand Budapest was more than just a job for Theo; it was a symphony, each chime and clatter adding to its unique melody. Tonight, however, the symphony had taken an unexpected turn. 


Theo paused at a doorway, listening intently. A muffled cry pierced the usual hum, followed by a heavy thud. He cautiously pushed open the door, his heart pounding in his chest. The room was dimly lit, casting long shadows across the ornate furniture. And in the center of it all, sprawled on the plush carpet, lay a man. Not just any man, but Monsieur Gustave himself. His usually impeccably pressed uniform was rumpled, and his face, normally etched with a mischievous grin, was contorted in pain.
