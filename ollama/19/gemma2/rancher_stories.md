The air hung thick with the scent of sagebrush and dust, the relentless sun beating down on Jebediah "Jeb" Tucker's weathered face. The Wyoming wind whipped through his thinning hair, carrying with it the low moans of cattle scattered across the rolling plains. His ranch, Double T Spread, sprawled out before him like a patchwork quilt of brown and green, stitched together by dusty trails and the occasional ribbon of water winding through the parched landscape. Jeb squinted at the horizon, where the line between earth and sky blurred into an hazy blue, his brow furrowing as he searched for any sign of trouble. A hawk screeched overhead, a lone sound in the vast emptiness that stretched out around him. This was his domain, this land carved from the unforgiving heart of the American West, and Jeb knew every inch of it like the back of his calloused hand. 


But today, something felt different.  A prickling unease crawled up his spine, a sense that the familiar rhythm of the ranch had been disrupted by an unseen force. It was just a feeling, he told himself, a rancher's intuition honed by years under the Wyoming sky. Still, he couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that something was about to change.
