The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Amelia Brightwood's head, their pale glow illuminating the dusty aisles of "Bargain Bonanza." The discount store wasn't exactly bustling, more like a slow, wheezing beast on its last legs, shuffling through piles of unsold merchandise and fading dreams.  Amelia sighed, swiping her gum-stained finger across the grime that had accumulated on the register screen. Another day, another mountain of crumpled receipts, and a symphony of beeping echoing through the cavernous store. 


The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cracked linoleum floor, highlighting the faded posters advertising "Rollback Tuesdays" and half-priced blenders â€“ promises made and broken like countless plastic toys littered around her feet.  A lone fly buzzed lazily in a cloud of dust motes, its wings catching the light as it passed Amelia's weary face. This wasn't exactly the life she'd envisioned for herself, but at least the boredom was comforting, a dull ache compared to the sharp edges of disappointment that had carved themselves into her soul.
