The humid Mississippi air clung to Elara Vance like a second skin as she stepped out of her beat-up Ford onto the cracked asphalt of Harmony Grove's main street.  A rusted "Welcome to Harmony" sign creaked in the breeze above her, its faded paint barely visible against the peeling wood.

The local paper had already run out of words - "Missing," "Searching," "Unsolved" â€“ echoing Elara's own growing sense of frustration. This wasn't a simple case of a teenager running away. Something was deeply wrong, and Elara, with her sharp wit and relentless pursuit of truth, was determined to uncover it.
