The air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary in Bartholomew “Bart” Cleaver's shop. Dawn was just beginning to bleed across the slate rooftops of Blackwood, painting the cobblestone streets outside in hues of bruised purple and orange. Inside "Cleaver & Son," centuries-old butcher blocks gleamed under the flickering gaslight, their surface slick with the residue of last night’s hams and sausages. Bart, a man built like a redwood with hands calloused as old leather, stood behind the counter, sharpening his largest cleaver with practiced strokes. 

The rhythm of the rasp against steel was a familiar lullaby to him, soothing away the lingering anxieties that clung to him like the morning mist. Today, he had a feeling, would be anything but ordinary.  A raven perched on the window ledge outside cawed loudly, its dark eyes seeming to peer right into Bart's soul. He felt a shiver crawl down his spine, a premonition as heavy as the slab of beef resting on the counter before him.
