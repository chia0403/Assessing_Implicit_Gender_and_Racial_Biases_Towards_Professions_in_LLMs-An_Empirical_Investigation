The cobblestones of Lower Harbor were slick with the morning mist, each one reflecting a pale sliver of dawn light. A chill wind whistled through the narrow alleys, tugging at Sergeant Elias Thorne's heavy woolen cloak as he patrolled his usual beat. 

Elias, a man built more for strength than grace, hunched his shoulders against the bite of the air. His beard, thick and braided with silver wire, caught the light like frost as he adjusted his iron-studded helmet. He scanned the shadowy recesses where merchants unloaded their wares and urchins scavenged for scraps. This was the heart of the city's underbelly, a place where whispers of rebellion simmered beneath the surface, and danger lurked around every corner. 


Today, Elias felt it more acutely than usual. A prickling sensation on the back of his neck told him to be vigilant, his senses hyper-alert for anything out of the ordinary. He tightened his grip on the hilt of his sword, its polished steel glinting ominously in the dim light. This wasn't just another patrol. Something felt different.
