The musty scent of aging paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Thistlewood, Head Librarian of the grand Blackwood Manor Library. Sunlight slanted through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the silence. Rows upon rows of towering bookshelves lined the room, their shelves groaning under the weight of centuries worth of knowledge.  Amelia ran her fingers along the spines, tracing titles both familiar and forgotten, each one whispering tales of lives lived and worlds imagined. The library was a sanctuary for Amelia, a place where she felt truly at peace, surrounded by the tangible echoes of history and imagination. 


But today, the tranquility was shattered. A sharp rapping on the heavy oak door broke the silence, startling a flock of sparrows perched precariously atop the grand reading table. Amelia straightened her spectacles, apprehension tightening her chest like a vice. Visitors were rare in the Blackwood Manor Library, especially unexpected ones.  Who could be interrupting this sacred space?
