The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Miss Evelyn Rosepetal's meticulously organized classroom.  Tiny felt animal cut-outs clung to bulletin boards adorned with alphabet charts and crayon masterpieces. The air smelled faintly of Play-Doh and disinfectant. It was 8:00 am on a Tuesday, the busiest, most chaotic hour in Miss Rosepetalâ€™s world. Twenty pint-sized bundles of energy were already clamoring for her attention, their chatter a symphony of half-formed sentences and excited squeals.  

Evelyn took a deep breath, her lavender-scented hand lotion providing a fleeting moment of calm amidst the whirlwind. She adjusted the bright yellow cardigan over her floral blouse, a smile gracing her lips as she surveyed the scene before her. This was it, her happy place. Despite the occasional tantrum or spilled glue stick, this classroom, these children, were everything to her.
