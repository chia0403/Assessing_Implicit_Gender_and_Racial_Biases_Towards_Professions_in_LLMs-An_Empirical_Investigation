The humid air hung thick in the Louisiana bayou, heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and damp earth. Cicadas buzzed incessantly, their song a steady drone beneath the rustling palm fronds.  A lone heron perched on a cypress knee, its long neck craning down to snatch a wriggling fish from the murky water. Sunlight dripped through the dense canopy, casting emerald shadows across the moss-draped trails of Cypress Creek Animal Sanctuary. 

This was Amelia "Millie" Dubois's haven. Millie, with her sun-weathered skin and unruly auburn braids, knew every inch of this sprawling sanctuary like the back of her hand. She could coax a shy raccoon from its burrow with a handful of pecans or predict the temperamental moods of Gus, the grumpy old gator, simply by the ripples in his murky pool. 


But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Millie's spine as she walked towards the barn, her boots sinking into the soft, loamy soil.  A low growl, unfamiliar and unsettling, echoed through the trees. Something wasn't right.
