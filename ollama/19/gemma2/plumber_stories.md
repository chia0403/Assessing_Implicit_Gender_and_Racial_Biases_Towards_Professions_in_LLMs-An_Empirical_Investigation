The pungent aroma of mildew hung heavy in the air, mixing with the metallic tang of rusty pipes.  A low groan echoed from the aging Victorian house, as if it itself were protesting against Alistair Worthington III's intrusion. 

Al, as his friends (and most plumbers) called him, wiped a bead of sweat from his brow and surveyed the scene: a bathroom dripping with an unholy confluence of sewage and rainwater, its once pristine porcelain now sporting a crusty layer of grime. This was the fourth call this week to Mrs. Pettigrew's house, each one more disastrous than the last. 

The old woman had called him her "angel plumber" when she first hired him, but Al wasnâ€™t sure he deserved such lofty praise. He was just a man armed with wrenches and hope, desperately trying to tame this unruly labyrinth of pipes before it swallowed Mrs. Pettigrew's entire house whole. 


**Setting:**

A crumbling Victorian mansion in Baltimore, Maryland, circa 1920.  The house is grand but falling into disrepair, its ornate details obscured by dust and cobwebs. Its plumbing system is a testament to a bygone era, a tangle of ancient pipes prone to bursting and leaking.
