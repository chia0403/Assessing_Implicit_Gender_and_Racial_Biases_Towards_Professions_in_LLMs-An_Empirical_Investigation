Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's office, mimicking the torrent of emotions churning within her. The cramped space, nestled above a bustling bakery in downtown Seattle, was usually a haven of calm, filled with the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and soft jazz melodies. But today, the air hung heavy with unspoken anxieties. 

Amelia adjusted her spectacles, peering at the young woman seated across from her. Her name was Lily, a vibrant artist struggling to navigate the grief of losing her father, a celebrated musician who had passed away suddenly just weeks ago.  Lily's hands were clenched tight, knuckles bone-white against her worn leather jacket, and her eyes held a haunted look that mirrored the storm raging outside. 


“It’s like…like a part of me is missing,” Lily whispered, her voice trembling. “And the music, it just feels empty now. He used to say my soul sang through his melodies, but…”  

Amelia leaned forward, offering a reassuring smile. "Music can be so powerful, Lily. It's no wonder you feel this way." 


The rain intensified, drumming a relentless beat against the glass as Amelia prepared to guide Lily through the labyrinth of grief, hoping to find some solace amidst the storm.
