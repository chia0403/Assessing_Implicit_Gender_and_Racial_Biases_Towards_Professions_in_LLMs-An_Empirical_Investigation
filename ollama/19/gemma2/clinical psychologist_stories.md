The rain hammered against the glass walls of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the insistent drumming in her chest. Outside, Seattle was shrouded in a perpetual grey twilight, mirroring the heavy atmosphere within. Her current patient, a young man named Silas, sat rigidly on the plush leather couch, his gaze fixed on a point somewhere beyond the rain-streaked window. He had arrived with a tremor in his hands and a knot of fear tightening his throat. 

Eleanor watched him, her years as a clinical psychologist etching lines of empathy into her face. She understood Silas's turmoil; he was caught in the maelstrom of grief and guilt following a sudden accident that had taken his younger brother's life.  

"It feels likeâ€¦like a part of me is missing," Silas finally said, his voice barely a whisper. 

Eleanor leaned forward, her gaze warm and steady. "That's understandable, Silas. Grief can feel like an emptiness, a void where someone you loved used to be."


The small office hummed with the low murmur of the rain and the distant drone of city traffic, but for Eleanor, the world narrowed down to the young man on her couch, his vulnerability laying bare before her. She knew this would be a long journey, navigating through the labyrinth of grief together, but she was determined to help Silas find his way back to the light.
