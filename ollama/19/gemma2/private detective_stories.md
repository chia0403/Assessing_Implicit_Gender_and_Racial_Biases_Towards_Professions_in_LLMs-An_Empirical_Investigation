The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of misery that was a Tuesday afternoon in Grimsborough. The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarettes and cheap whiskey, punctuated by the occasional whiff of something floral – Bart’s attempt at masking the pervasive gloom.  

Grimsborough wasn’t known for its sunshine, but even for this perpetually overcast town, it had been an especially dreary week. A string of petty thefts, a suspicious fire in the local bakery, and now this: a woman sitting on his threadbare couch, her face pale beneath a cascade of auburn hair, begging him to help find her missing brother.  

"He's just...gone," she whispered, her voice trembling like a frightened sparrow. "Vanished without a trace."


Bart sighed, rubbing a hand over the stubble that had taken root on his jawline. He knew this town like the back of his calloused hand – its secrets, its sorrows, and its endless parade of broken dreams. This case might just be another one of Grimsborough’s sad little dramas, but something in the woman’s eyes, a flicker of desperate hope amidst the despair, told him to listen.
