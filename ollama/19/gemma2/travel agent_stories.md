The scent of lavender hand soap and stale jasmine tea hung heavy in Amelia Thistlewood's tiny office. Outside, the bustling marketplace of Seville throbbed with life – the rhythmic clang of blacksmiths, the melodic cries of vendors, and the chatter of tourists jostling for space. But inside Amelia’s Travel Emporium, a dusty silence reigned.  

Amelia herself, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun that threatened to escape at any moment, hunched over a worn map of the Aegean Sea, its edges frayed from countless consultations. She traced a gnarled finger across the coastline, muttering under her breath about ferry schedules and ancient ruins. Her phone lay forgotten on the counter, silent save for the occasional insistent buzz of an unread message. The clients, those who hadn't been swayed by cheaper online options, were thin on the ground these days. 

A bell tinkled above the door, announcing a fresh interruption to Amelia’s reverie. She looked up, her hazel eyes widening with surprise.
