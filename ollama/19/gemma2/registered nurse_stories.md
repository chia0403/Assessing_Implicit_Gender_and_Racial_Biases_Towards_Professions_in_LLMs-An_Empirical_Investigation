The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the bustling emergency room. A symphony of beeps, murmurs, and urgent calls filled the air, a familiar soundtrack to her 10 years as an RN at Mercy General. Tonight was no different: a young boy with a suspected broken leg lay whimpering on a gurney, a frantic woman clutching her chest in pain, and the ever-present scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air. Amelia took a deep breath, smoothing down her starched blue scrubs before approaching a nurse frantically scribbling notes by a patient's bedside. 


"Anything I can help with, Clara?" she asked, her voice calm amidst the chaos. 

Clara looked up, her face etched with worry. "We've got another code blue in Trauma Two. Dr. Singh needs an extra hand."


Amelia nodded, her pulse quickening slightly. Code blue meant one thing: someone was fighting for their life, and every second counted.  "I'm on it," she said, pushing through the throng of medical professionals towards the back of the ER, ready to face whatever challenge awaited them.
