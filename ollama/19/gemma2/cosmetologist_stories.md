The bell above the door tinkled merrily, announcing another customer to Veronica "Ronnie" Blossom's salon.  

Ronnie sighed, momentarily distracted from the intricate braid she was weaving into her client's fiery red hair. Business hadn't been blooming lately in their tiny coastal town of Oakhaven. The scent of salt air mingled with the usual perfume and hairspray, a constant reminder of the tourist season's ebb and flow. 

Ronnie glanced up as the new customer entered. A tall woman in a faded raincoat stood hesitantly by the door, her face obscured by the hood. Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the already muted colours of the pastel-painted walls. Ronnie smiled warmly, hoping to lure the mystery customer into the warmth and chatter of her salon. 

“Welcome!  Dry off your hair, darling, let me fix you up,” Ronnie called out, gesturing to a vacant chair by the window. "What can I do for you?"


The woman slowly lowered her hood, revealing striking emerald eyes that seemed to hold secrets as deep as the ocean swirling outside.
