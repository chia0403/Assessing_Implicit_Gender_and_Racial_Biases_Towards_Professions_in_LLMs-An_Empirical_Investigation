The sun cracked over the horizon like an egg on a hot griddle, casting long, orange fingers across Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's fields. Dew glistened on the emerald leaves of his prize-winning pumpkin patch, each plump orb promising a bountiful harvest come autumn. A symphony of bird song rose from the orchard trees, their branches heavy with blushing peaches and ripening plums. 

But Bart Thistlewick wasn't listening to the sweet melody of summer. He was squinting at a dark smudge on his otherwise pristine horizon, a shadow creeping closer like a wolf sniffing out its prey. His calloused hand tightened around the worn handle of his shovel, knuckles white against the polished wood. Something wasn't right. 


The setting: A rural patch of land nestled in the heart of Vermont, known for its fertile soil and rolling hills. The air is thick with the scent of freshly turned earth and ripening fruit, a symphony of buzzing bees and chirping crickets providing a soundtrack to the lazy summer day. However, beneath this idyllic facade lurks an unsettling unease.
