The air hung thick with the scent of rosemary and lavender, a fragrance Amelia "Amy" Brighton had carefully cultivated to mask the underlying metallic tang of hair clippings. Her shop, "Shear Delight," nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Prague's Old Town, was a haven from the bustling tourist throngs just beyond its weathered wooden door. Sunlight streamed through stained-glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the worn floorboards and antique barber chairs. Amy, with her auburn hair pulled back in a neat braid and piercing blue eyes framed by silver wire-rimmed glasses, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. It was a Wednesday afternoon, usually slow, but today held a peculiar tension â€“ a stillness that pricked at Amy's senses like a stray cat's purr. 


The bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer.  Amy glanced up, expecting the familiar face of Mrs. Novak, her regular client for the past decade. Instead, she saw a stranger, cloaked in an air of mystery that sent a shiver down her spine. He was tall and lean, his features obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.
