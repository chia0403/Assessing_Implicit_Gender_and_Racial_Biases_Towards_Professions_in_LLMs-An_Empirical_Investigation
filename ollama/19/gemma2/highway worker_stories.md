The sun beat down on Bartholomew Silas "Bart" Blackwood's neck like an angry blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy world of asphalt and dust that stretched before him. He squinted at the horizon where the shimmering heat waves danced with the distant pines, a mirage taunting him with cooler, greener pastures. 

He wiped his brow with a grease-stained rag, momentarily grateful for the thin brim of his worn straw hat offering scant respite from the merciless July sun. The air thrummed with the incessant drone of cicadas and the rhythmic crunch of machinery further down the highway construction site.  Bart sighed, hefting another shovelful of gravel onto the rapidly growing mound beside him. It felt like a Sisyphean task, this endless cycle of moving dirt, only to have trucks scoop it up and haul it away moments later. 

He longed for the days when his life wasn't confined to this stretch of dusty asphalt in rural Mississippi. Days filled with fishing on the clear, cool waters of nearby Lake Pearl, not grappling with stubborn roots underfoot and battling the searing heat. But dreams were a luxury he couldnâ€™t afford.  


The only escape was the occasional rumbling truck passing by, bringing a fleeting rush of wind that stirred the dust devils swirling around his feet and momentarily cooling his sunbaked skin. Until then, Bart Blackwood would continue to toil under the relentless Mississippi sky, one shovelful at a time.
