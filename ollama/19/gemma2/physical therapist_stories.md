The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer that Eleanor Amelia Cartwright tried to liberally apply every few minutes. It wasn't enough. The clinic felt like a petri dish, teeming with coughs and sniffles, but then again, what physical therapy clinic wasn't? Especially during flu season.  

Eleanor was on her feet for the majority of her workday, guiding patients through exercises designed to reclaim mobility after injury or illness. Today’s roster included Mrs. Peterson, recovering from a hip replacement, Mr. Johnson with his wonky knee, and young Timmy, whose broken arm had rendered him permanently attached to his sling. Each patient brought a unique set of challenges – the frustration of Mrs. Peterson, the stubbornness of Mr. Johnson, and the boundless energy (and boredom) of Timmy. 

Eleanor's small office was tucked away on the second floor of a nondescript building in the heart of bustling downtown Chicago. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the city lights into shimmering streaks of color. The rhythmic drumming of raindrops provided a steady soundtrack to Eleanor's day, punctuated by the occasional grunt and sigh of her patients.   


Despite the mundane setting and the constant flow of suffering bodies, Eleanor found solace in her work. There was something deeply satisfying about witnessing the slow but steady progress of each patient, watching them regain their strength and independence, one agonizingly small step at a time.
