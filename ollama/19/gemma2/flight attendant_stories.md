The flickering fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Beatrice Croft's weary face.  She leaned back against the galley wall, the aroma of stale coffee clinging to her uniform like a second skin. It was 3:17 am, and Flight 429 to Dublin was stuck on the tarmac at JFK, delayed by yet another "mechanical issue." Amelia, already running on fumes after a grueling overnight flight from Shanghai, felt a familiar wave of dread wash over her. The kind that comes with knowing this delay will mean missed sleep, a rushed connection, and probably a screaming toddler in economy class.

The setting sun bled into the New York skyline beyond the cockpit window, painting the clouds with hues of bruised purple and fiery orange.  Through the glass, Amelia could see the city slowly waking, unaware of the purgatory she was currently enduring. The air inside the plane felt heavy, thick with anticipation and restless energy. Passengers shuffled impatiently down the aisle, their faces a mixture of boredom and irritation.

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to find some semblance of calm amidst the chaos. This was just another day in the life of a flight attendant â€“ dealing with delays, grumpy passengers, and the constant threat of turbulence. She straightened her uniform, plastered on her best smile, and prepared herself for whatever this night had in store.
