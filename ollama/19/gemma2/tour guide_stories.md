The sun beat down on the cobblestones of Dubrovnikâ€™s Old Town, turning the ancient stone into shimmering pools of heat.  Amelia Eleanor Cartwright, or "Ellie" as she preferred, wiped the sweat from her brow with a flourish, adjusting the brim of her straw hat. She stood before a gaggle of tourists, their faces flushed and blinking against the glare, clutching maps that looked more like crumpled paper airplanes than navigational tools. 

"Welcome, everyone," Ellie chirped, her voice amplified by the small microphone clipped to her collar. "To the Pearl of the Adriatic! The City of Walls!  The backdrop to one of the most beloved fantasy series on television!" she finished, a mischievous twinkle in her eye as the crowd murmured excitedly.

Ellie took pride in guiding these eager tourists through Dubrovnik's winding streets and hidden courtyards. It wasn't just about reciting historical facts; it was about weaving tales, bringing the past to life with anecdotes and stories that made the ancient walls come alive, and turning ordinary stones into whispered secrets of kings and queens. But today, Ellie had a feeling something was different. A prickle of anticipation ran down her spine, like a tremor beneath the cobblestones.  


The air buzzed with an unusual energy, a sense of something unseen just beyond the reach of sight.
