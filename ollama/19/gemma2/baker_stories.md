The aroma of warm sourdough and cinnamon swirled around Amelia Clementine Harper like a comforting blanket. It was always like this at dawn in her little bakery, "Clementine's Corner," nestled on the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, a town where secrets were as common as freshly baked bread.  Amelia, with flour dusted across her cheeks and a smudge of jam clinging to her apron, hummed along to the crackle of the radio playing Frank Sinatra softly in the background. Outside, the sky was just beginning to blush with the promise of sunrise, casting long shadows that danced on the bakery's window display filled with pastries still warm from the oven.  Amelia glanced at the handwritten sign above the door: "Open for business," it proclaimed, a beacon of hope and deliciousness in the quiet morning air. Little did she know, this seemingly ordinary day would soon be anything but.
