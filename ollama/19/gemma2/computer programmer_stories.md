Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Finch’s apartment, blurring the neon signs of the city below into an impressionist painting of colour. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old fire escape outside his window.  Elias, hunched over his battered keyboard, barely noticed. His eyes were locked on the screen, fingers dancing across the keys in a furious blur as he battled a particularly nasty bug in his code. 

Elias Finch was a programmer by trade, and a hacker by passion. He worked days at a stuffy accounting firm, crunching numbers and filing reports, but it was at night, when the city slept and the world went quiet, that he truly came alive. His tiny apartment, crammed with wires, circuit boards, and half-eaten takeout containers, became his sanctuary, a fortress of code and digital dreams where he could rewrite the rules.

Tonight, however, the usual thrill of the chase was replaced by a gnawing unease. The bug he was struggling with felt different, insidious. It whispered to him, a silent siren song promising power and knowledge beyond anything he’d ever imagined. 


Elias rubbed his tired eyes, willing himself to focus. He had to get this right. This wasn't just another line of code; it was a key, a gateway to something unknown, something...dangerous.
