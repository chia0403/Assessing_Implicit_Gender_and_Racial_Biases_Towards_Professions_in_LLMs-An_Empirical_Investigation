The whirring of the ultrasonic scaler was Amelia Beatrice Lavender's siren song. It sang to her soul, its high-pitched hum a comforting lullaby amidst the chaos of bustling Maplewood Dental. The waiting room, perpetually decorated with floral arrangements that were tragically more plastic than petal, buzzed with nervous chatter and the rustling of magazines no one actually read. 

Amelia, however, found solace in the sterile routine. She knew each instrument's weight, the precise angle to hold them for optimal plaque removal, the reassuring rhythm of scraping and polishing. Each patient was a blank canvas, a fresh opportunity to leave behind the subtle satisfaction of a gleaming smile and the faint scent of minty toothpaste. 

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on Amelia's skin as she surveyed her first patient â€“ a man with eyes that held an unsettling stillness, a man whose name, according to the chart, was Silas Blackwood. His teeth, coated in a thick layer of grime, seemed to whisper secrets beneath the surface. 


Amelia adjusted her mask and smiled, a practiced gesture designed to mask the growing knot of apprehension in her stomach. "Welcome to Maplewood Dental, Mr. Blackwood," she said, her voice echoing with forced cheerfulness.  "Ready for your cleaning?"

Silas Blackwood stared back at her, his gaze unwavering and unreadable. He simply nodded.
