The rhythmic clang of hammer against granite filled the air, punctuated by the rasp of chisels carving away at the stubborn stone. The midday sun cast long shadows across Amelia "Amy" Stonehaven's workshop, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm light. Her weathered hands, calloused and strong from years of wielding tools, deftly manipulated a chisel, shaping a piece of jade into a delicate curve. Beads of sweat trickled down her forehead, mingling with the grime that clung to her brow.

The workshop itself was a symphony of textures and scents: smooth granite slabs polished to a gleam, rough chunks of unworked stone piled high in one corner, and the earthy aroma of sawdust and oil clinging to the air. Tools hung neatly from the walls, their steel surfaces reflecting the sunlight like miniature mirrors. The only sound that dared compete with Amy's work was the gentle hum of bees buzzing around her fragrant herb garden, nestled between the workshop and the crumbling stone wall that bordered her property. 

Amy Stonehaven, named for her craft and the family legacy she carried on her shoulders, took a moment to survey her work. She held the jade carving aloft, its smooth surface catching the light.  It was beautiful, but it wasn't finished. This piece, like all Amy's creations, held a story waiting to be told.
