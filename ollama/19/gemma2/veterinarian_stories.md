The wind whipped around Dr. Amelia Croft's weathered coat as she surveyed her domain. Her small veterinary practice, "Willow Creek Animal Clinic," was nestled amidst rolling hills and vibrant fall foliage in rural Oregon. The air smelled of damp earth and woodsmoke, a comforting blend that always brought her solace after a day spent tending to the animals who called this valley home. 

Today, however, the familiar tranquility felt strained. A nervous tremor ran through Amelia's usually steady hands as she adjusted her stethoscope. It was the kind of day where even the chirping birds seemed hushed, waiting for something momentous to unfold. And she had a feeling that whatever it was, it wouldnâ€™t be good.
