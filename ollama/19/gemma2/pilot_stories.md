The acrid tang of engine oil and burnt hydraulic fluid hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic hiss of escaping coolant. Captain Amelia "Ace" Hawthorne ran a gloved hand over the cold metal of the cockpit canopy, its once pristine surface now scratched and marred from the emergency landing. The desert wind whipped at her flight suit, stinging her exposed skin with grit and sand.  

She was stranded in the heart of the Mojave Desert, miles from civilization, a victim of an engine failure that had forced her to ditch her experimental aircraft, the Valkyrie, into a remote canyon. The setting sun cast long shadows across the desolate landscape, painting the red rock formations in hues of orange and purple. A lone hawk circled overhead, its keen eyes searching for signs of life amidst the vast emptiness. Ace knew she had limited time before darkness descended and temperatures plummeted. Her only hope was to find shelter, signal for help, and survive until morning.
