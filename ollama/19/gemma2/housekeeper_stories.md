The musty scent of old parchment and beeswax clung to Amelia Thistlewick like a second skin. It was the aroma of her world – the sprawling Victorian mansion she called home, though "home" felt more like a cage gilded with grandeur. Every day, Amelia navigated the labyrinthine halls, polishing silver that whispered tales of forgotten feasts, dusting portraits whose eyes seemed to follow her every move, and scrubbing floors stained with the memories of countless lives lived and lost within these walls. 

Amelia Thistlewick, despite her name's hint at nobility, was a simple woman, born into servitude and destined to spend her days catering to the whims of others. But beneath her unassuming demeanor and careful movements lay a spark of curiosity, an insatiable thirst for stories hidden in the shadows of this house – stories she yearned to unravel, even if they threatened to expose secrets better left buried. 


The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the dusty library where Amelia now found herself, preparing for the evening's grand dinner party. A chill wind rattled the window panes, whispering through the gaps in the aged glass, and Amelia shivered, pulling her threadbare shawl tighter around her shoulders. As she surveyed the towering shelves crammed with leather-bound volumes, a glint of gold caught her eye. It was nestled between two dusty tomes, barely visible beneath a layer of cobwebs. A small, golden key – its purpose as mysterious as the house itself.
