The amber glow of the "Rusty Nail" sign cast long shadows across Raina Evangeline's tired face. She dabbed at a spilled beer with a rag, the sour scent mingling with the stale aroma of cigarettes and regret that clung to the worn leather barstools. Outside, the August heat pressed against the grimy windows, turning the bustling neon-lit street into a hazy mirage. Raina sighed, leaning back against the counter, her reflection staring back at her – a woman carved from weariness and resilience, with eyes that held stories she hadn't yet shared.  

The Rusty Nail wasn't exactly known for its clientele. It was more of a haven for lost souls, the forgotten, and those who preferred to drown their sorrows in cheap whiskey and bitter conversation. Raina knew them all by name – Billy with his haunted eyes, Rose who always ordered the same gin martini, and old man Fitzwilliam, who grumbled about everything but tipped generously. 

Tonight, though, felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced on her skin. The air hummed with a restless energy, as if something was about to break, shift, or maybe even explode. 


Raina adjusted the worn leather apron around her waist and straightened her weary shoulders. Another night at the Rusty Nail. Another chance for someone's story to unfold.
