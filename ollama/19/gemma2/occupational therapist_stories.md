The humid Georgia air clung to Eliza Rose Hawthorne like a second skin as she pushed open the heavy glass doors of Riverbend Rehabilitation Center. A wave of antiseptic scent washed over her, mingling with the faint aroma of stale coffee and lemon-scented cleaner – a familiar cocktail that marked the beginning of another workday. 

Eliza, or "Liz" as everyone called her, adjusted the strap of her messenger bag, its weight comforting against her hip. Inside nestled neatly organized tools of her trade: colorful therapy balls, stacks of progress charts, and a worn copy of "The Brain That Changes Itself," tucked between a set of resistance bands and a miniature puzzle box. 

She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the day ahead. Riverbend was known for its eclectic mix of patients – stroke survivors, amputees, those recovering from traumatic brain injuries, and even a few cases of chronic pain that defied easy explanation.  Today, Liz's schedule promised a diverse set of challenges: helping Mrs. Peterson practice her grip strength, guiding Mr. Davis through a series of balance exercises, and working with young Tommy to relearn how to write his name.

But as she walked down the brightly-lit hallway, past rows of closed doors where patients waited, Eliza couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that today would be different.  A knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach – a premonition that something was about to change at Riverbend, something big and perhaps...unsettling.
