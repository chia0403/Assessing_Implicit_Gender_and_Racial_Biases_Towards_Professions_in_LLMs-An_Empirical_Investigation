The air in "Chez Henri" hung thick with the aroma of simmering lamb ragout and caramelizing onions, punctuated by the occasional sharp hiss of butter hitting hot steel. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm haze above Amelia Genevieve Dubois' head as she kneaded a hefty ball of dough with practiced ease.  

Amelia, or Amy as everyone called her outside of the kitchen, was the heart and soul of Chez Henri, a small French bistro tucked away on a quiet cobblestone street in the Marais district of Paris. Its walls were lined with vintage postcards depicting Parisian scenes, faded photos of happy diners, and hand-painted ceramic plates showcasing classic French motifs. 


Her grandmother, also named Amelia, had opened the restaurant decades ago, passing down her recipes and love for good food to Amy. Now, at twenty-five, Amy was carrying on that legacy, her hands a blur as she transformed simple ingredients into culinary masterpieces.  But today felt different. A knot of tension tightened in her chest, pulling at the usually carefree rhythm of her work.  Something felt off, a subtle shift in the air like the hush before a storm.
