The fluorescent lights hummed above Miss Eloise Everly's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees.  She stood at the front of her 10th-grade English classroom, surveying the landscape of teenage apathy that stretched before her. It was the last week of school, and the usual stifling heat of June in Savannah, Georgia, had seeped through the cracks in the windows, turning the air thick and humid.  Papers littered every desk, crumpled like abandoned dreams, and a few students snored softly in their chairs, headphones perched precariously on their ears. Eloise sighed, adjusting her tortoiseshell glasses that perpetually threatened to slip down her nose. This was it. The final battle against summer's siren song, the last stand against boredom and the inevitable descent into teenage chaos. But even Miss Everly, with all her love for literature and her unwavering belief in the power of a well-crafted sonnet, couldn't quite summon the energy to fight this particular war.
