The air in "Flour Power" bakery was thick with the scent of vanilla and sugar. It clung to Beatrice Amelia Frost's apron like a second skin, mingling with the faint aroma of burnt caramel from her latest mishap - a batch of molten chocolate ganache that had decided it preferred life as a puddle on the oven floor. 

Beatrice sighed, wiping a smudge of frosting from her cheek with the back of her hand. It was Tuesday afternoon, which meant Mrs. Henderson's "It's Your Fault I Have Wrinkles" birthday cake was due for pickup, and a rogue dollop of pink buttercream had somehow managed to find its way onto Beatrice's nose during the intricate piping process. 

Her reflection in the bakery window showed her hair, pulled back in a messy bun, threatened to escape its confines, mirroring the chaos within the fridge where mismatched cake toppers jostled for space amongst the leftover sprinkles.  She was about to embark on another one of her signature "Whimsical Wonderland" cakes - this time for a six-year-old's birthday party themed around unicorns and rainbows. The pressure was on. After all, in Flour Power, where every creation was a masterpiece, Beatrice Frost was the Queen of Cakes.
