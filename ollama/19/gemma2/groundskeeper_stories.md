The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick’s woolen coat like a damp shroud as he surveyed his domain. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky with pale hues of pink and orange over the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor. Dewdrops, fat and glistening, adorned the vibrant emerald leaves of ancient oaks and maples, their branches reaching towards the heavens like gnarled fingers grasping for the first light of day. 

Bartholomew Thistlewick, a man weathered by years spent tending to the earth, took a deep breath, the crisp air filling his lungs with the scent of damp soil and blooming roses. His hands, calloused from years of digging and pruning, rested on the worn leather handle of his trusty spade. The rhythmic chirp of sparrows filled the air, a cheerful counterpoint to Bartholomew’s contemplative silence. He began his rounds, his footsteps silent on the dew-kissed grass, a solitary figure amidst the sprawling beauty of Blackwood Manor.
