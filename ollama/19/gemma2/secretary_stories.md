The beige walls of Mr. Caldwell's office seemed to close in on Amelia Beatrice Perkins as she tapped her manicured nails against the polished oak desk. Outside, the city throbbed with the chaotic symphony of rush hour, but within these four walls, time ticked by at the glacial pace of a bored goldfish.  

Amelia sighed, adjusting the silk scarf that matched her pale blue blouse – a calculated move to project an air of competent femininity. Mr. Caldwell, however, seemed oblivious, his head buried in a newspaper that was older than Amelia herself. She'd tried everything to pique his interest: strategic cough drops for coughs that didn't exist, carefully placed coffee spills, even the bold maneuver of wearing a fuchsia dress (which had garnered only a grunt of disapproval).  

Today was different, though. Today, a package arrived, addressed in elegant cursive to "Mr. Caldwell, Esq." with no return address. Amelia’s pulse quickened. This wasn't just another invoice or tax form; this felt significant, dangerous even. A hint of adrenaline coursed through her veins – perhaps the monotony of Mr. Caldwell's life was about to be interrupted.


The setting is a mid-century modern office in New York City, 1962.
