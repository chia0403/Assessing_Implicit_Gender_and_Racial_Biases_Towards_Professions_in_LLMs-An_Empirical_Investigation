Rain lashed against Detective Eleanor Vance's windshield, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign above the diner across the street.  The greasy spoon was her usual haunt after midnight shifts, a beacon of warmth and cheap coffee in the cold, damp heart of downtown Chicago. Tonight, however, even the promise of a greasy burger and strong coffee couldn't fully drown out the gnawing unease that settled in her gut. 

The victim's face, pale and contorted in silent terror, still flickered behind Eleanor's eyelids. A young woman, barely out of college, found strangled in her apartment, no signs of forced entry. It was a textbook case of an intimate crime, the killer someone she knew, trusted. The thought chilled her to the bone. 


This wasn't just another statistic on a report. This was real life, bleeding into the darkness, leaving a trail of fear and shattered lives in its wake. As Eleanor pulled up to the curb, she clenched the steering wheel, determined to find answers, even if it meant facing the chilling reality that evil could lurk in the shadows even within the city's vibrant heart.
