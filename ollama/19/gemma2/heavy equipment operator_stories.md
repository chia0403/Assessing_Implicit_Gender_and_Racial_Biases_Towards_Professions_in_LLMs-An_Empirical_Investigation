The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and dust, clinging to Clara Evelyn Blackwood's faded denim overalls like a second skin.  She squinted at the sunrise, a smear of orange across the horizon that promised another scorcher in the Nevada desert. The whine of cicadas filled the pre-dawn stillness, a lullaby she knew better than any songbird's. Around her, the skeletal remains of an abandoned mining town jutted from the landscape like forgotten teeth.  Clara gripped the controls of her Caterpillar D9, its massive frame a familiar comfort against the unforgiving terrain. The engine rumbled to life, sending a tremor through her bones and announcing her arrival to the sleeping desert. 


Today's task was simple: clear a path for the new pipeline snaking its way across their desolate corner of Nevada.  Just another day in Clara's world - pushing dirt, breaking rock, leaving nothing but a trail of dust and ambition in her wake. But this time, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, a whisper of unease amidst the familiar symphony of machinery. It wasnâ€™t just the heat; there was a tension in the air, a sense that she was being watched.  Clara brushed it off as nerves. The desert played tricks on you sometimes.
