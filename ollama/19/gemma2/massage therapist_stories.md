The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of chamomile tea brewing on the countertop. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the gentle breeze that ruffled the gauzy curtains.  Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Miller sighed contentedly as she adjusted the plush towel draped over her client's waist, her fingers lingering for a moment on the taut muscles of his back before moving to knead away the tension with practiced ease. The quiet murmur of classical music filled the spacious room, punctuated only by the rhythmic creak of Ellieâ€™s stool as she moved from one point to another. 

Ellie worked in "Serenity Now," her own small massage therapy practice nestled in a charmingly dilapidated brick building on a side street in Portland, Oregon.  A hand-painted sign depicting a woman with outstretched arms and flowing hair hung above the entrance, beckoning weary souls seeking solace within its walls. Outside, the city bustled with life, a symphony of car horns and distant laughter, but here, within the sanctuary Ellie had created, all that existed was the gentle rhythm of her work and the quiet sighs of relief from those she helped.
