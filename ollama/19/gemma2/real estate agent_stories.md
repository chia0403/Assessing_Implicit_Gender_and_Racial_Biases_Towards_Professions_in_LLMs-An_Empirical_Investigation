The scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually brought Amelia Josephine Beaumont a sense of tranquility. But today, it felt oppressive, mirroring the weight settling in her stomach as she surveyed the sprawling Victorian mansion before her. Sunlight glinted off the ornate ironwork on the porch railing, highlighting the years of neglect that had taken hold. 

Amelia adjusted her straw hat, the brim casting a shadow over her worried eyes.  This wasn't just another listing; it was her grandmotherâ€™s house, passed down through generations until its sale now felt like a betrayal of family history. The "For Sale" sign in the front yard, stark white against the faded green paint, seemed to mock her from across the overgrown lawn. She took a deep breath, attempting to quell the nervous flutter in her chest. 


The setting is a quiet, affluent suburb on the outskirts of a bustling city. The year is 1988, and Amelia, despite being a successful real estate agent, finds herself grappling with the emotional burden of selling her grandmother's beloved home.
