The acrid tang of metal shavings hung heavy in the air, mingling with the greasy scent of machine oil. A shaft of light pierced through the grime-coated window, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stale air.  At a workbench cluttered with blueprints, Tamsin Everhart, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously traced lines on a sheet of vellum with a silver stylus. The rhythmic scratching of the stylus against the paper was the only sound besides the whirring and clinking of the machinery that surrounded her.

Tamsin worked at the esteemed Ironworks of Aethelred, a sprawling labyrinth of workshops nestled within the city of Brightspire. She wasn't an engineer, nor did she possess the innate talent for forging metal like some of her colleagues. Instead, Tamsin was a draftswoman, tasked with translating the engineers' visions into tangible plans. Her world was one of lines and angles, of carefully measured dimensions and precise notations. 


It was a world that felt both confining and strangely liberating to her.  

Today, however, the familiar rhythm of her work was disrupted. A new blueprint lay before her, its pages filled with intricate diagrams she had never encountered before. The project's title, "The Skyfire Engine," sent a shiver down her spine. This wasn't just another gear or cog; this was something revolutionary, something that could change the very fabric of Brightspire... for better or worse.
