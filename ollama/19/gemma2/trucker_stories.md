The biting Arizona wind whipped across the cracked asphalt, stinging Bartholomew “Barth” Jackson's face as he adjusted his trucker cap. The sun beat down mercilessly on his rig, a battered Peterbilt 379 affectionately nicknamed "Old Bessie,"  her chrome gleaming like tarnished jewels in the harsh desert light. Barth squinted at the horizon, where a mirage shimmered in the distance. Another hundred miles to Flagstaff, another day closer to home after three weeks hauling cargo across the unforgiving landscape. He rubbed his calloused hands together, feeling the familiar ache in his joints.  Barth was a man of routine, finding solace in the rhythm of the road: the hum of the engine, the drone of CB chatter, the endless stretch of asphalt that felt like an artery pumping life through America. But this trip felt different. There was an undercurrent of unease, a prickling sensation on the back of his neck, as if he were being watched.  He chalked it up to fatigue and pushed on, hoping the familiar comfort of home would wash away the creeping feeling of dread. 


The setting is a desolate stretch of highway in Arizona, midday with scorching sun and strong winds. The air is thick with dust and the landscape is flat and barren except for the occasional tumbleweed rolling across the road.
