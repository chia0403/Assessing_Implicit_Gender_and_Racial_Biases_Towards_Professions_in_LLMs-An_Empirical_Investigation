The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and sawdust, a familiar aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like a comforting second skin.  He stood at the edge of his workshop in the heart of Redwood Creek, Oregon. The late afternoon sun was slanting through the trees, casting long shadows across the wooden floorboards beneath him. Sunlight danced on the surface of his latest project: a magnificent cedar chest, destined for a young couple's wedding vows. 

Elias was known throughout the valley for his work. His hands moved with the grace of a seasoned dancer as he crafted intricate pieces from wood, each one imbued with an almost ethereal beauty that mirrored the spirit of the forest itself. But today was different. A knot of worry sat in his stomach, twisting like a vine around his old oak heart.
