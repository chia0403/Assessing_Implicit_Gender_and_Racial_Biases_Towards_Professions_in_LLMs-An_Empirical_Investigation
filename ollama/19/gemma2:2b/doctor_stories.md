The air in the small clinic hung heavy with humidity and the scent of antiseptic.  Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, mirroring the anxious rhythm of Dr. Amelia Wright's heart. It had been days since she last saw her family, days since their usual summer vacation banter replaced by hushed whispers and tearful goodbyes. She was supposed to be on a beach somewhere, not in this dusty corner of West Bengal, treating villagers with fevers that whispered tales of a monsoon-driven blight. 

Her worn leather satchel felt heavier than usual, filled with medical kits and hope - a constant companion these past weeks. The setting sun cast long shadows across the makeshift clinic's courtyard, its golden glow highlighting the worried lines etched onto her own face. Today was the day she hoped to offer some semblance of comfort to the ailing village elder, Kali Prasad, whose cough sounded like dry leaves crunching underfoot in a forgotten forest.
