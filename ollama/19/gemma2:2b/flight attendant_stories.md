Rain lashed against the windows of Flight 375, mimicking the chaotic tempest brewing inside Amelia Hawthorne's chest.  She watched as passengers disembarked, their faces etched with fatigue and frustration after a long day of travel across the Atlantic.  Amelia, ever efficient, was already prepping for the next wave, her sharp eyes scanning for any irregularities.

Her uniform, crisp and white, felt like armor against the storm that raged within. The job was more than just serving drinks and snacks; it was being a safe haven in a metal cocoon hurtling across the sky. Amelia knew how to navigate the turbulent waters of human emotions – from the ecstatic joy of first-time flyers to the deep sorrow of those who had lost loved ones. She was a silent witness to life's milestones, a chronicler of tales untold.  

The airport lay shrouded in the grey twilight, mirroring the somber mood that clung to Amelia like a second skin. Tonight, though, she wouldn’t just be serving drinks and snacks. Tonight, there was something more. The plane had been delayed for hours, and something about this particular group of passengers – their hushed conversations and anxious glances – made her heart skip a beat.  Amelia found herself wanting to know what secrets they were carrying in the cramped space between them.
