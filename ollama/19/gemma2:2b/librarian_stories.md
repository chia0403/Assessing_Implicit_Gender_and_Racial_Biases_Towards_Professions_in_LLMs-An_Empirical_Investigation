The flickering gaslights cast long shadows across the hushed rows of books.  Rain lashed against the library windows, creating a hypnotic rhythm that echoed the steady ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.  Eleanor Thorne, with her silver-threaded shawl pulled tightly around her shoulders and a stack of dusty tomes held precariously beneath one arm, sighed as she surveyed the scene.  The old Wrenhaven Public Library had always been her sanctuary, but tonight it felt more like a tomb than a haven. 

She was a creature of habit, Eleanor. Every Wednesday evening she'd find solace amongst the worn leather-bound volumes, her favorite spot nestled near the back wall where a lone window looked out onto the rain-soaked town square. But tonight, something was different. The air felt charged with an unease that sent chills down her spine, despite the heavy scent of old paper and the comforting warmth emanating from the fireplace.  A sense of dread clung to the quiet evening, amplifying the weight of a week's worth of unanswered questions about the disappearance of Mrs. Peterson, the library's beloved caretaker, and the cryptic note found tucked beneath her chair.
