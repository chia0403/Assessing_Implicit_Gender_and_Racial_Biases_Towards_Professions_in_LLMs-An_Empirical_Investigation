The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the humid Louisiana night outside. Dr. Evelyn Thorne adjusted her worn scrubs, feeling the familiar weight of the scalpel against her palm. A chill ran down her spine despite the fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. It wasn't just the cold steel; it was something else entirely that tugged at her like a phantom limb - the memory of his last gasp, of the blood painting the white hospital sheets crimson red. 

The operating theatre, usually a symphony of surgical precision and controlled chaos, felt suffocating tonight. The rhythmic beep of the monitors sounded mockingly cheerful in the tense silence as Evelyn stared down at the patient's chart – Mr. Landry, a seemingly ordinary farmer with an unusually fragile constitution. 
He was just another case for Evelyn to conquer, or so she thought. But the air thrummed with a palpable unease that even her years of surgical practice couldn’t quite quell. Tonight, it felt like something far more sinister lurked beneath the surface, something connected to Mr. Landry's past and a secret buried deep within his family history.  As Evelyn began pre-operation checks, she knew this case was not just about saving a life; it was about unraveling a mystery that threatened to consume her.
