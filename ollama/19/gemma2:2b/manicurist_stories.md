But tonight, as she meticulously shaped and filed a customer's almond nails, a storm brewed within the cozy confines. The tension, thick as the varnish on her workbench, was palpable. It seemed to cling to Elara's every move.  Her usually vibrant eyes were now wide and haunted, reflecting a fear both familiar and unnerving - the fear of losing herself again.
