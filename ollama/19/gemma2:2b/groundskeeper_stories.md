The morning mist clung to the gnarled branches of the ancient oak trees like ghostly fingers, each one draped in a fragile veil of silver. The sun, barely cresting over the horizon, sent a weak golden glow through the haze, painting the dew-kissed grass in hues of emerald and rose. It was here, amidst the fragrant chamomile fields bordering Oldfield Manor, that Elias Thorne, renowned groundskeeper for three generations, surveyed his domain. 

Elias, a man whose weathered face bore the weight of countless seasons and whose hands, calloused from years of working the earth, moved with practiced grace, adjusted the heavy watering can in his worn leather gloves. A lifetime spent tending this land had woven its threads into his very being, leaving him strangely attuned to the subtle whispers of the wind through the leaves, a language only he truly understood.  The manor stood silent and imposing in the morning light, its sprawling grounds filled with secrets whispered by the wind.
