The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in an almost mocking melody, each flicker reflecting off the worn plastic tiles of the register.  Elara "Ellie" Reyes, perpetually tired even at 3 AM, stared into the endless stream of customers buying their caffeine fix for the final hour before sunrise. The aroma of stale coffee and burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, a testament to countless shifts spent working in this bustling corner shop. Ellie wasn't one for small talk, but she had learned the rhythm of their routines by heart – a steady influx of early-morning commuters, college students with overflowing bags, and truckers pulling into town on long-haul routes all seeking a quick bite before hitting the road.

Ellie’s usual quiet hum was interrupted by a burst of energy; a young woman, no older than 20, bounced in front of her, eyes wide as saucers.  "I just need...a coffee." The woman's voice, tinged with an unfamiliar accent, held a nervous urgency that sent a shiver down Ellie’s spine. "And…the newspaper, please?" She added, pushing a crumpled paper bag towards Ellie with trembling hands.
