The neon glow of the "Lucky Star Diner" cast an eerie red light over the rain-slicked asphalt.  Rain hammered down in sheets, turning the already dim streets into a mirror reflecting the anxieties churning in Amelia Croft's gut. She sat hunched over a steaming cup of coffee, its aroma barely masking the acrid smell of desperation hanging heavy in the air. 

Amelia Croft was known for two things: her relentless pursuit of truth and her ability to find herself at the heart of it all - often right when trouble started brewing. Tonight, she'd been chasing down leads on a string of bizarre disappearances that had gripped the city of New Alexandria.  For weeks now, whispers of a shadowy figure lurking in the shadows, snatching people off the streets and disappearing into the night, had begun to spread like wildfire. 

Tonight, however, she was close. The last known victim was Mr. Bellweather, an accountant who lived on the edge of town with his wife and two kids, but he vanished without a trace after leaving the bakery that morning. Her contact had said there was someone watching him - a shadow figure, just as elusive as the missing man himself. 


Amelia took a deep breath, the taste of burnt coffee suddenly bitter in her mouth. She needed to move fast before something else went missing. The fear was palpable; the city was on edge, and Amelia knew she was walking into a maelstrom.
