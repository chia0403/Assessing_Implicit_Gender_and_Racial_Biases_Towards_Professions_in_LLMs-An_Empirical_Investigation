## The Dust Bowl Blues

The fluorescent lights hummed like bees trapped in an ancient hive as Bartholomew "Bart"  Fitzwilliam shuffled his way down the hallway, his worn mopping bucket trailing behind him. It was 3:00 AM, and the only other sounds besides the incessant whirring of the air vents were the distant, rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his own footsteps and the occasional groan from the groaning pipes in the ceiling. Bart had worked this shift for decades, ever since they’d replaced his father in this cursed role.  His father had been a man with fire, not dust. A man who'd once lit a room with laughter and stories before he took to his final, inevitable rest in the same building that housed his son. 

Bart sighed, gazing at the faded portrait of his father on the wall. It was almost as if the room itself knew his sorrow. The picture seemed to mock him -  a younger version of Bart, eyes wide with enthusiasm for something he couldn't quite remember. Maybe it was the job, maybe it was the emptiness within him that made the memory feel so distant. 

The air in this old library was thick with dust and a palpable sense of sorrow, mirroring Bart’s own burden. He wiped down dusty tomes, each page whispering forgotten tales of grandeur, romance, and tragedy.  Each tome held a silent plea - a desperate longing to reclaim its former glory, just as he longed to find his father's lost spark within himself. 


This was it, the place where memories lingered in the form of crumbling pages and dusty corners, where time had stopped at some point before even Bart’s birth, and continued to do so for him even after he’d passed on.

He looked down into the depths of his bucket, a kaleidoscope of swirling dust. It was the same place that held his father's old soul - a memory buried beneath years of grime and neglect.
