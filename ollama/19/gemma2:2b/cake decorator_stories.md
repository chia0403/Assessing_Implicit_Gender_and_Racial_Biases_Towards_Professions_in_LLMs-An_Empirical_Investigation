The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and cinnamon, like a warm hug from an old grandma. But for Amelia "Amy" Sinclair, it was a siren's song that lured her in every morning.  Her tiny shop, "Sugar & Spice", nestled between a struggling bookstore and a vintage clothing store, pulsed with life thanks to its colorful array of cakes. Amy, with her ever-present flour dusting and rosy cheeks, kneaded her way through the day, transforming simple sugar into edible works of art.

Today, a storm rolled in, bringing with it the familiar rhythm of rain against the shop window.  The wind howled its discontent outside, and Amy watched as a single sheet of ice crashed on her bakery roof. A shiver ran down her spine – something was different tonight, and not just the sudden chill in the air.
