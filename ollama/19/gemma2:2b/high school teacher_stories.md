Rain hammered against the single window in Mr. Abernathy's classroom, each drop echoing like tiny bombshells against the old, warped glass. The aroma of damp wood permeated through the air, mingling with the lingering scent of burnt coffee and teenage angst that clung to everything.  He watched the storm brew outside his worn office, a familiar ache settling in his chest.

His name was Alistair Thorne, but everyone called him "Al," even though it was just another layer of dust between them and their shared understanding. The 17 years he had spent teaching English at Willow Creek High were like chapters in an old book, each one marked with the faded ink of a student's growth or heartbreak. This storm, this year, felt different, heavier somehow.

His gaze shifted to his classroom door, where a lone figure stood in the pouring rain.  A girl, all slouched shoulders and heavy boots, her hair a tangled mess against the collar of an oversized sweater. Her backpack, overflowing with textbooks and notebooks, seemed too much for even her petite frame. It was a familiar sight, yet today it felt like a ghost from another life.

"Ms. Delacroix," he said, his voice thick with unspoken concern. "You look soaked through."
