Rain lashed against Dr. Elias Vance's office window like angry fists against frosted glass.  The incessant drumming matched the thrumming in his chest as he reviewed the latest report from the coroner. The victim, an esteemed philanthropist and city councilman named Theodore Sterling, had been found dead in his luxurious penthouse apartment, a single gunshot wound to the head. No forced entry, no sign of struggle, just an empty champagne glass on the floor. It was all too clean, too perfect for a human hand, leaving Elias with a gnawing feeling of something off, something amiss. 

Elias's office, normally a haven of order and reason, was now a whirlwind of unanswered questions. The case file lay open on his desk, its familiar pages suddenly as dense and confusing as the fog creeping in through the cracks in the windowpane. He pulled out a worn photograph â€“ a smiling Sterling, arms around his wife's waist, their faces lit by the warmth of a shared sunset. 

The city lights outside flickered like dying stars in an otherwise cold night sky. The weight of these cases, the stories they unraveled, they were as much part of him as the beat of his heart - and tonight, it felt heavier than usual.  He knew he had to find the truth, no matter how elusive or cruel it may be.
