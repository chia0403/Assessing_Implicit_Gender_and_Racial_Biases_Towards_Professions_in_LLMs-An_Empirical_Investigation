Rain lashed against the windows of Willowbrook Rehabilitation Center, mimicking the anxious rhythm of Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes's heartbeat.  The scent of bleach and disinfectant mingled with the sterile tang of antiseptic cleaner in the hallway, creating an aroma that was oddly comforting amidst the storm brewing inside her own head. Ellie ran a hand through her already windswept auburn hair, her gaze flitting between the clock on the wall and the worn-out floor tiles under her feet.  It had been five minutes past her scheduled shift, yet she was still struggling to find the right words for Mrs. Delacroix's daughter, Clara. 

**Setting:** A small-town private rehabilitation center nestled in the heart of rural Vermont, Willowbrook Rehabilitation Center serves as a haven for those struggling with physical ailments and post-operative recovery. The community, steeped in tradition and a quiet sense of melancholy, seemed to cling to its own rhythm, mirroring the slow, deliberate pace of life that Ellie found so endearing yet exhausting in equal measure. 

**Main Character:**  Ellie Hayes is a young physical therapist with an unwavering belief in her patients' strength and resilience. Despite being new in town, she feels a deep connection to the community's history and its people, even as she grapples with the emotional burdens of her own past.
