## Story Opening: 

Rain lashed against the glass roof of the sanctuary, each drop exploding in miniature fireworks across the ceiling. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Willow's weathered hands gently stroked the fur of a grizzled, one-eyed wolf named Argos. He whined softly, his voice a rumble that resonated through Amy's bones like a forgotten dream.  The storm was a familiar friend to her; it had been years since she'd started at Willow Creek Sanctuary, years spent navigating the intricate tapestry of life and loss woven into the hearts of the wild creatures under her care. 

The sanctuary nestled on the cusp of an ancient forest, its boundary marked by a gnarled cedar fence that creaked in the wind like a forgotten lullaby. The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and earth after rain, a mix that both soothed and invigorated Amy. She looked down at Argos, his fur damp and glistening, then glanced up at the clock on the wall - 3:17 AM. "Just one more shift," she muttered to herself, the words like wind chimes in the silence of the sanctuary. 

The storm was not merely weather; it was a reminder of time's relentless passage and the delicate balance that held all living things together.  Amy knew this as well as she knew her own breath.
