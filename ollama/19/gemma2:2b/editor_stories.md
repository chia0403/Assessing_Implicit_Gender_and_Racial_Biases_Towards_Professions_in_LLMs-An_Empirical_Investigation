Rain lashed against the high-ceilinged office, each drop exploding like tiny fireworks on the worn linoleum floor. A symphony of thuds reverberated from the city's relentless downpour outside as Amelia Thorne meticulously went over her latest manuscript. "The Whispering Walls," they called it, a collection of gothic short stories by a reclusive author known only as "Eamon." 

Amelia, a veteran editor at Blackwood & Quill Publishing house, was accustomed to such bouts of chaos in her own world—a world where deadlines held the same weight as a hurricane's roar. Tonight, however, the pressure felt different. This wasn't just another project; this was a book that could be her ticket to success, a chance to finally leave the shadow of "The Fallen Angel" – the novel that had brought her both fame and her current label: "the editor who couldn’t escape the ghosts of her own past."  

Amelia rubbed her tired eyes. The manuscript's dark prose danced across the page, each sentence like a brush stroke on a canvas of fear and longing. She longed for a moment of clarity, a respite from this storm she was battling both within and without.
