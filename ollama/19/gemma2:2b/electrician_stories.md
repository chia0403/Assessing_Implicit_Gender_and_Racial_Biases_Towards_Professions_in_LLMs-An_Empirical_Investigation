The flickering streetlamp cast long, dancing shadows on Daniel “Danny” Hayes’s worn hands as he tightened the last wire to the weather-beaten lamppost. It was another late night in the city that never slept, and Danny felt like an unwelcome shadow himself - a solitary figure battling against the indifferent darkness of the concrete jungle.  His toolbox lay open beside him, filled with tools both familiar and unnerving, each one holding the promise of power or destruction depending on its purpose. 

The year was 1982, New York City. The air hung thick with coal smoke, and every building pulsed with a quiet hum of electricity that both energized and intimidated Danny. He was a man born in the glow of flickering neon signs and the harsh glare of fluorescent tubes, his life intertwined with the pulse of this city's veins – its rhythm of power and chaos. As he surveyed the street below, the rhythmic clang of a nearby construction site echoed through the night, a reminder that even in this stillness, change was ever-present. 

Danny closed his toolbox, feeling a familiar sense of satisfaction mixed with a growing unease. Something felt different tonight - the air seemed to hum with a new energy, and the silence felt almost unnatural.  Tonight's job wasn't just fixing a broken streetlight; it held the potential for something bigger, something that could shake the city’s very core – if he dared let it.
