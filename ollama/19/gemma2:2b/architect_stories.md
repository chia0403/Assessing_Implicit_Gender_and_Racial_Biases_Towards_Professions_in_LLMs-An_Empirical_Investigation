The rain hammered against the cafe windowpane, mimicking the frantic beat of Amelia's heart as she stared at the crumpled plans in her hand.  Her meticulously designed skyscraper, "Ascension," was supposed to be the pinnacle of modern architecture, a testament to her years of painstaking effort and late nights poring over blueprints. But now, it felt more like a sinking ship. 

**Setting:** A bustling Parisian cafe on the edge of Montmartre, the air thick with steam from fresh croissants and the murmur of conversation. The light filtering through the rain-streaked window cast long shadows on Amelia's face, highlighting the exhaustion etched into her usually sharp features.  A lone figure hunched over his coffee across from her: a stern-looking man, his face obscured by the brim of a fedora. 

**Character:** Amelia Dubois, known for her audacious designs and relentless pursuit of perfection in architecture. While admired by many, she was haunted by a secret - the ghost of her deceased father who had instilled in her a passion for innovation that bordered on obsession.  But even he would be surprised by the current state of "Ascension," which now felt more like an impossible dream than anything else.
