## The Case of the Missing Dividend 

**Setting:** A swanky penthouse apartment overlooking the glittering cityscape of New Orleans.  A jazz band plays softly in the background, its melodies intermingling with the soft hum of air conditioning. Rain patters rhythmically on the expansive windows, a stark contrast to the frenetic energy of the city below. 

**Main Character:**  Theodore "Teddy" Dubois, age 32, was a man shrouded in a perpetual layer of mild irritation. He sat hunched over his desk, surrounded by mountains of tax returns and financial statements that seemed determined to defy any semblance of order. Teddy wasn't your average accountant; he had a penchant for the finer things in life, like vintage Cuban cigars and rare bourbon, but also a talent for unraveling intricate financial puzzles.

The hum of the city outside felt almost mocking. He glanced at his watch - 3:17 pm. This was supposed to be his prime time. The moment when he'd pull his "eagle-eye" act and find the flaw in the seemingly perfect financial tapestry. But, instead of the usual thrill of victory, Teddy found himself facing a frustrating reality: Mrs. Delacroix's annual dividend had vanished.

A single red letter on his desk lay like a crimson flag, demanding his immediate attention. "The case was closed," it read in bold black letters. "Where is her dividend?"
