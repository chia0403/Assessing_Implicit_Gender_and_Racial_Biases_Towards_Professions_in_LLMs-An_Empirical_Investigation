The air in the cramped drafting room clung heavy with the scent of old paper and greasepaint, a familiar aroma that had filled Amelia's life since she was a girl. Outside, a crisp autumn wind whipped fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes across the cobbled streets of Portland's historic district.  Amelia, her hands stained the colour of burnt umber from countless drafts, hunched over her workbench, her fingers tracing the delicate lines of a complex architectural drawing on the floor-length mirror that served as her only window. The city's sprawling skyline, cast in hues of grey and orange by the setting sun, was visible only through the reflection,  a stark reminder that the world beyond the room held countless possibilities. 

Her name was Amelia Thorne, and for years, she'd toiled away amidst the dust-laden air and the cacophony of her father's workshop, learning to translate the unspoken needs of people into a language understood by buildings and bridges. Today, however, a peculiar kind of silence hung in the room, almost painful. Even the whirring of Amelia’s own pen seemed amplified.
