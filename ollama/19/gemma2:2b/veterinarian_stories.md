The air hung heavy with humidity, thick enough to choke on in the sweltering Louisiana heat. Dr. Amelia Moreau, her forehead slick with perspiration, wiped sweat from her brow as she scanned the bustling emergency room of Bayou City Animal Hospital. Neon lights flickered above rows of kennels, illuminating a cacophony of meowing, barking, and chirping, all vying for her attention. The smell of disinfectant, mingled with the faint aroma of fish and chicken, was both comforting and nauseating in equal measure. 

Amelia’s hands were already slick with an oily, gray substance, likely from a previous patient who had suffered a nasty bite. She felt a familiar pang of sympathy as she examined the anxious terrier mix, whimpering softly in its cage, his paw swollen and bruised. The little creature, barely more than a shadow of itself, looked like he'd been dragged through mud for miles by something far bigger. 

Amelia glanced at the clock – it was past noon, an hour later than she had anticipated arriving after her shift at the clinic in Baton Rouge. Her usual lunch break with her old lab partners seemed a lifetime away as she grappled with a growing sense of dread. Something was off, a feeling deep within that wouldn’t be satisfied by simple diagnostics and routine checks.
