The salt spray stung Amelia's face as she stood on the rickety wooden dock. The wind whipped her auburn hair across her forehead, pulling at the loose strands that had escaped her braid.  She took a deep breath, letting the ocean air fill her lungs and calm the anxieties that churned in her chest. It was always this way - the moment before starting work, a knot of apprehension constricting her stomach. 

Her name was Amelia Hayes, and she was an occupational therapist at the coastal community center in Seahaven.  For her, working with children who were struggling with disabilities was a calling. A chance to guide them through a world often perceived as difficult, a world designed for people without their unique needs. The setting of the center itself was symbolic: the wooden dock stretched out over the churning waves of the Atlantic Ocean. It connected the bustling life in town and the wild, untamed heart of nature.

Today's case involved three young kids, all with developmental delays. There was Ethan, whose hand-eye coordination struggled to keep up with his classmates at play; Fiona, whose frustration with communication often left her withdrawn; and Oliver, who was battling a severe sensory processing disorder that made him sensitive to touch and sound. 

As Amelia walked towards the small group huddled together on the ground in a circle, she thought about the ocean's vastness. It represented the unknown â€“ the challenges these children faced - but also offered a glimpse of the endless possibilities of growth. Her job was not simply to ease their struggles; it was to empower them to navigate the waves, create their own shore, and build their individual tides.
