The air hung thick with diesel exhaust and anticipation, swirling around Clayton "Stone" Miller like a restless ghost.  He was parked under the flickering neon glow of the 'All-Nite Diner' on I-40 just outside Oklahoma City.  His rig, a hulking 18-wheeler named 'Lady Luck', hummed beside him as if in agreement with the brewing storm. It was more than just weather; it was the kind of restless night only a trucker in a lonely corner of the country knew how to feel.

The diner's neon sign flickered, casting an oily sheen on Stone's worn leather jacket and faded work boots. He reached for his lukewarm coffee, the heat barely penetrating the chill clinging to him like cobwebs. The smell of burnt toast and stale cigarettes drifted in from the kitchen, a familiar aroma as potent as ever. This was his refuge, this greasy spoon where stories were shared over lukewarm mugs and dreams were spun over plates of fried bacon and grits. Tonight's story, however, was different. Tonight, the storm wasnâ€™t just outside; it was inside him too.
