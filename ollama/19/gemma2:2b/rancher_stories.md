The dust devils danced across the parched plains of New Hope Valley like miniature tornados, twisting into grotesque shapes against the unforgiving blue sky.  Every gust brought with it the scent of creosote, dry earth, and something else – a faint metallic tang that clung to Elara Blackwood’s throat like a bad memory. 

Elara Blackwood, known as "Ellie" by the locals who wouldn't dare call her anything else out loud, ranched a swathe of land nearly as vast as her spirit. Her weathered hands, rough from years spent wrestling cattle and mending fences, held a worn leather-bound journal with its pages filled with scribbled notes and faded maps of the place she called home. 

Ellie was a woman who knew these lands better than her own reflection, their wrinkles etched into her face as deeply as the furrows in her soul. She’d spent more years under the unforgiving New Hope sun than any other, witnessing the land's stubborn beauty and its brutal indifference alike. And tonight, beneath the suffocating silence of a summer moon, something was different.
