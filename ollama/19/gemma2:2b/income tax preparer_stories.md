The whirring of the fan did little to quell the oppressive summer heat that clung to Elias Thorne's small office like a suffocating blanket. He squinted at the file in his hands - another year, another sea of receipts and W-2 forms. The fluorescent lights hummed above him as he meticulously sorted through them, each document blurring into the next until the room seemed an almost tangible entity of paperwork.  His name was Elias Thorne, a seasoned income tax preparer who had dedicated his life to navigating the treacherous waters of the IRS, but today, even his customary calm seemed frayed. 

Elias sighed and ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. The air outside was thick with humidity and the smell of freshly cut grass from Mrs. Peterson's lawn – her meticulous routine was part of what kept Elias sane amidst the chaos he helped create in others’ lives.  But today, it seemed more oppressive than usual. A gnawing sense of unease settled over him as he looked at his watch: 10 minutes past closing time. 

This year's tax season felt different, a feeling Elias tried to brush off, a persistent hum beneath the quiet thrum of paperwork. Tonight’s case - Mrs. Peterson, always the first and last client Elias helped – was unlike any he had encountered before. The woman’s silence was deafening, her eyes clouded with an unspoken turmoil that chilled him to his core.  His heart thumped a steady beat against his ribs as he picked up another file: this one seemed even heavier than usual, a feeling of something deeply wrong permeating the room.
