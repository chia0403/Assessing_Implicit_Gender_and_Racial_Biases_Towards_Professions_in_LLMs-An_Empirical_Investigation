The air hung thick with humidity in the Louisiana bayou, mirroring the oppressive tension in Dr. Evelyn Pierce’s chest. She adjusted her worn Stetson hat, shielding her face from the relentless afternoon sun. The rhythmic lapping of water against the weathered dock felt like a metronome counting down to another disaster. "This is why I don't go fishing," she muttered under her breath, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She wasn’t exactly meant for tranquil waters and swaying palms – she was meant for the brisk air of Boston's hospital halls, where life-and-death decisions were made within the sterile confines of an emergency room. 

This swamp doctor gig had been a last-ditch effort to escape the city's suffocating grip, a pact with her dying father that he would keep his promise of seeing Evelyn fulfill "one more good deed" in their old Mississippi home.  But every day brought a fresh wave of anxiety, a constant hum of fear under the guise of rural charm. Today was no different. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across the water, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something terrible had been brewing for weeks, hiding beneath the placid surface of the bayou.
