The midday sun beat down on Ethan Miller's back, turning his work shirt into a damp, clingy thing against his skin. Dust devils danced in the distance, conjuring up phantom images of long-gone tumbleweeds rolling across desolate highways.  Ethan was a veteran of this landscape – forty years spent mending the cracks in asphalt, smoothing over miles of forgotten tracks. But even with years under his belt, he felt like an alien here, a solitary cog in a machine too vast for him to comprehend. The air hung thick and stagnant, punctuated only by the whine of his jackhammer and the occasional honking of some impatient truck driver barreling past. His gaze drifted across the shimmering expanse of the highway – a ribbon snaking through the sun-baked plains like a forgotten promise.  He squinted at the distant town, its silhouette stark against the blue canvas, and sighed. This was all he'd ever known. He'd never dared to imagine a life beyond the horizon, beyond the endless expanse of asphalt that stretched before him. 


**Setting:** The story takes place in the American Southwest, on a desolate stretch of highway running through a vast, flat landscape.  The sun is high and scorching, with dust storms occasionally whipping up across the plains. It's a timeless, almost mythical place where time seems to stand still.

**Main character:** Ethan Miller. He's a seasoned highway worker in his late 50s who has spent his life working on this land.  He's stoic and silent but possesses a hidden well of loneliness that he keeps buried deep inside him.
