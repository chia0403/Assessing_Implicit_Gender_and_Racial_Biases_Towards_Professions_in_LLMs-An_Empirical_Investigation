The wind whipped around Elias "Elly" Thorne like a rogue's fist, biting at his cheeks and whipping rain into icy stings that stung his eyes.  He hunched deeper into his worn coat, squinting through the driving mist as he surveyed the crumbling Victorian house across the street. The peeling paint on its once-proud facade was giving way to creeping rot, and the sky above was turning a sickly, bruised purple. It wasn't just the weather that made Elly feel so uneasy. There was something else, an undercurrent of tension thrumming through the air as he watched the old widow Mrs. Henderson pace her cracked porch steps like a caged sparrow.  The house's history was thick with whispers and shadowed corners, and today, it felt like those secrets were finally going to spill out. 

Elly whistled a tuneless melody, his worn-out boots splashing in the puddles forming at the bottom of the steep incline. It was another day on the job, another roof patched, another storm weathered. But sometimes, even a seasoned roofer like Elly felt the weight of the unspoken stories that clung to these aging buildings, pulling him deeper into their forgotten lives.
