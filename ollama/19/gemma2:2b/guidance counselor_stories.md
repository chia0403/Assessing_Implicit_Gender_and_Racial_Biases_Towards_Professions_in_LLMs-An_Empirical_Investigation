Rain lashed against the windows of Northgate High, each drop sounding like a miniature gunshot in the otherwise silent room. Inside, Ms. Amelia Hawthorne’s desk sat bathed in the pale glow of the office lamp, its surface cluttered with paper and pens. The smell of old pencils and stale coffee clung to her like an unwelcome second skin. Ms. Hawthorne ran a hand through her already disheveled hair, sighing.  Another year at Northgate, another deluge of students drowning in their own anxieties.

The bell for the 9th-period lunch break clanged, followed by a chorus of teenage voices shouting down the hallway. Ms. Hawthorne’s gaze drifted to the overflowing filing cabinet on her desk. It was already brimming with notes from parents, frantic pleas from anxious teens – and yet, even as she knew the day would be just another symphony of stress, she couldn't help but find a strange kind of solace in it.  A sense of purpose thrummed within her, an unspoken vow to guide these students, however lost they might be, towards their own version of a brighter tomorrow.
