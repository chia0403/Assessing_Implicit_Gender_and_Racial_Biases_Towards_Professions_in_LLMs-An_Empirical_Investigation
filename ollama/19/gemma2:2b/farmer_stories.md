The wind whipped through Silas Blackwood's beard, carrying with it the scent of loam and rain-soaked earth. He stood at his weathered farm gate, squinting against the harsh glare of the rising sun, its orange glow painting the fields in hues of gold and crimson.  He ran a calloused hand over the worn leather of his weathered work boots, their grooves imprinted with years of toil. 

Silas Blackwood's farm, nestled amongst rolling hills just beyond the town of Willow Creek, had been his lifeblood for generations. He'd inherited it from his father, then his grandfather before that, and he knew every inch of this land like an old friend. But lately, something felt different. The usual rhythm of harvest, planting, and tending to the fields had become a discordant melody â€“ punctuated by unsettling whispers of change in the wind. A creeping unease hung over his soul, thicker than the morning mist that soon clung to the valley floor. 

Today was the eve of the Harvest Moon, a time when the veil between worlds was said to be thin, when magic lingered like smoke in the air. Silas wasn't one for superstition, but something felt profoundly wrong. He gripped his weathered pitchfork tighter, feeling a strange weight settle upon his heart, mirroring the heavy feel of the approaching storm clouds overhead.
