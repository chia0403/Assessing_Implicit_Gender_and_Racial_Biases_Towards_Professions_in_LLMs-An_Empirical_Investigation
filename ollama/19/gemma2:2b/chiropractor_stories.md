The midday sun beat down on Aurora's clinic, turning the polished mahogany floor into a shimmering mirage. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of eucalyptus oil and the quiet hum of adjusted spines.  Aurora, a woman whose vibrant auburn hair matched her fiery spirit, carefully maneuvered the patient's aching neck, a deep sigh escaping his lips as she worked. 

Her name echoed like a silent song in this peaceful haven: Aurora "Rory" Caldwell, Chiropractor Extraordinaire. It wasn't about flashy equipment or exorbitant fees; it was about understanding the human body's intricate symphony, and using her gentle touch to restore its harmony.  From the aches of overworked elbows to the stubborn knots of chronic stress, Rory knew how to coax life back into patients like a conductor guiding an orchestra. 

But today, a tension coiled tight in her chest, mirroring the knot in the patient's neck. It wasn't just the daily hustle and bustle; it was the unspoken weight pressing down on her shoulders, urging her towards something more...something she couldn't quite define.  Today felt different, a premonition swirling beneath the surface like the steam rising from a freshly-brewed cup of coffee.
