The crisp, starched white of the Bell Hop uniform felt like a costume to Theodore Hawthorne.  He'd only been working at The Grand Elysian for two months, but he already felt strangely out-of-place amongst the plush velvet and polished mahogany that clung to the hotel like a second skin.  His days were filled with meticulously arranging flower bouquets (mostly lilies, his manager claimed) and lugging heavy luggage. 

The year was 1928. Theodore found himself stationed in the bustling heart of New York City, where even the air itself hummed with an electric energy. The city's skyline, a majestic tapestry of gold-dusted towers, mirrored the sun on the glistening water that flowed beneath it.  He stood, hands tucked firmly into his pockets, watching as a line of impeccably dressed men and women hurried past, their faces hidden behind oversized hats and parasols. It was all so... different from the small town he'd left behind in Vermont. 

Theodore adjusted his hat, feeling the worn leather creak beneath his fingers. Tonight, he wasn't just a bell hop - tonight, he was about to get tangled in the heart of another story waiting to unfold.  His gaze drifted towards the grand ballroom, where an opulent cocktail party was being held. It felt like stepping into a painting â€“ swirling skirts and dapper suits, the air thick with laughter and music. But underneath it all, a hidden tension throbbed like a phantom heartbeat.
