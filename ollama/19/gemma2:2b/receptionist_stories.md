The air in Serenity's Reception hung thick with anticipation, a mixture of floral-scented air freshener and unadulterated nervous energy. The usual cacophony of ringing phones and clattering keyboards was subdued, replaced by a silence that seemed to hum with the weight of every unanswered query and every missed opportunity. It was 2:17 PM, which meant it was about time for the CEO's afternoon meeting - an event usually met with muted dread by Serenity, whose quiet demeanor had long been mistaken as passive indifference by her colleagues.

Serenity adjusted her glasses, a practiced hand hovering over the stack of unopened envelopes addressed to "Dr. Arthur Finch." She wasn’t quite sure why Dr. Finch was still her nemesis after years at this prestigious firm.  Perhaps it was the way he always seemed just out of reach, like an elusive bird perched on a branch too high for her to grasp. Or maybe it was the fact that his cryptic notes, delivered with precision and urgency in his signature font, had become something akin to personal grenades – detonating in the aftermath of every crisis or missed deadline. 

"Anything from Finch?" The words came out like a question, but not one that needed an answer. Amelia, her colleague who was still glued to her computer screen, looked up for a split second before going back to her files. “He’s been busy again,” she sighed, her voice barely above a whisper.
