## The Scent of Rain

The storm raged on outside, mirroring the turmoil within Amelia "Amy" Hayes.  Rain hammered against the roof of Mercy General Hospital, a steady rhythm that mirrored her own heartbeat. Tonight, she felt raw and exposed – like a single candle flickering in a windstorm. In her hand, clutched tight, was a worn leather journal, its pages filled with scribbled notes on patients' hopes and fears, their life stories unfolding beneath the sterile white walls of the ER. 

**Setting:** A bustling emergency room at Mercy General Hospital on a bleak night of a violent storm.  The air is thick with the smells of disinfectant, antiseptic, and fear – all swirling together in the chaotic symphony of medical emergencies.

 **Character Name:** Amy Hayes 


**Opening Line:** "They call this place 'mercy,' but tonight, it felt more like an echo chamber for despair."
