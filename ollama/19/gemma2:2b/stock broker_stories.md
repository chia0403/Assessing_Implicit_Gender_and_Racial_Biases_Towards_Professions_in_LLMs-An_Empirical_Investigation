The mahogany desk gleamed under the harsh fluorescent light, reflecting back the sharp angles of Daniel Ashton's gaze.  He was surrounded by the cacophony of Wall Street: the incessant ringing of phones, the staccato bursts of keyboard clicks, and the constant murmur of voices exchanging fortunes in a language he understood better than his own. Yet, amidst this symphony of finance, a discordant note resonated within Daniel's chest – an emptiness that echoed with each tick of the clock. 

Daniel Ashton wasn’t born for this city. He was meant for something more, something akin to the untamed wilderness he envisioned while gazing at the sprawling Montana landscape in his childhood home.  He lived in a world where the stock market danced like a fickle lover – rewarding those who understood its rhythm, and crushing those who stumbled with their steps.  And while Daniel's intellect allowed him to navigate this treacherous terrain, it hadn’t brought him any real joy. 

His penthouse apartment overlooking the city was a testament to his success: sleek steel and glass, bathed in an artificial glow that mirrored the soul-crushing anonymity he felt within its walls. But each night, Daniel would retreat into the dusty attic of his home, where the scent of pine from old books clung to the air. He’d pull out faded photographs and reminisce about a life before city lights dimmed his dreams. 


**Setting:**  Manhattan, New York City - specifically the financial district known for its towering skyscrapers and relentless hustle.
