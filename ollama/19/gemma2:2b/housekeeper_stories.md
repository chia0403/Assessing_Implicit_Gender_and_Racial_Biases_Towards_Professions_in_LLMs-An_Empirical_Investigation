The scent of lavender and dust hung heavy in the air, thick as a fog clinging to the worn, velvet curtains of Lady Amelia's manor house.  Amelia had long ago lost her youthful vibrancy, replaced by a quiet dignity that was only occasionally challenged by the occasional outburst over misplaced silverware or an errant pigeon. She was known around these hallowed halls simply as "Mavis," for it was Mavis who kept the cobwebbed walls and crumbling fireplaces alive. 

Her life, like the house itself, was a tapestry woven with meticulous care and enduring quietude. Her daily routine - the rhythmic thump-thump of her worn oak broom against the cold stone floorboards, the careful dusting of antique furniture with lavender-scented cloths, the whisper of secrets shared in hushed tones over spilled tea - held its own rhythm, as steady and unchanging as a metronome. It was a life that had been woven from years of tending to the needs of others, yet left her with an aching loneliness she couldn't quite put into words. 

Today, however, felt different. The air crackled with a new kind of tension, almost imperceptible at first but growing stronger like a tide creeping in on a sandy shore.  The old world felt as fragile as the silver teacups lining the china cabinet - and Mavis, for the first time in decades, was starting to feel it all too acutely.
