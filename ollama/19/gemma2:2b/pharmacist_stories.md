The air hung thick and stagnant in the tiny pharmacy tucked away behind the bustling fruit market in the old city of Alora. Even the jasmine incense that usually battled with the scent of ripening mangoes couldn’t pierce the suffocating haze hanging over Ethan Blackwood’s small apothecary. The setting sun cast long shadows across the worn wood floor, highlighting every dust mote and forgotten pill bottle that had seen better days. 

Ethan was a man of quiet routines, his life meticulously ordered like the rows of brightly colored vials he carefully sorted by date and label in his tiny office.  He was known for two things: his uncanny ability to accurately diagnose ailments with the help of ancient herbs and the surprisingly efficient efficiency with which he dispensed medication in the city’s burgeoning population. But tonight, a storm brewed within him. The usual tranquility was replaced by an unsettling tension that had nothing to do with the brewing storm outside and everything to do with his newest patient - a young woman named Elara who entered his shop clutching a tightly clasped locket, her eyes red-rimmed from unshed tears. 

He knew this wasn't just another case of a common cough or stomach upset.  Elara’s fear was etched on her face as deeply as the grime and dust coating the apothecary. She looked at him with an almost desperate yearning for answers, and it was in that moment that Ethan realized: tonight, the storm within Alora would only grow if he didn't understand the storm she carried.
