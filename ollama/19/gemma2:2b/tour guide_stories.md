## The Whispering Towers

The biting wind whipped Amelia's already damp coat as she stood at the entrance to the Grand Citadel, a magnificent stone edifice that had once served as the royal seat for the ancient Kingdom of Aethelgard.  She adjusted her worn travel scarf, the faded crimson color barely discernible against the swirling gray mist that clung to the mountain air. 

"Alright folks," Amelia called out, her voice echoing slightly through the deserted courtyard. The usual flurry of chattering and excited murmurs had been replaced by an eerie quiet, a stark contrast to the bustling energy of a typical tour day. It wasn't uncommon for the tours to be sparse in this remote corner of the country, but today's lack of visitors was especially unnerving.  

Her name was Amelia Hawthorne, and for years she'd been sharing the secrets of Aethelgard with eager tourists, weaving their historical narratives into a tapestry of vibrant stories. But now, the silence was more than just an absence of tourists; it felt like an actual presence, clinging to the crumbling arches, whispering tales from long-forgotten times.  

The Citadel's imposing stone walls stretched out before her, adorned with intricate carvings that seemed to pulse under the gray sky. It was said these walls held stories of ancient battles, lost royalty, and whispered curses – all shrouded in a veil of mystery that Amelia knew intimately. Today, though, something felt different, as if the very stones themselves were holding their breath, waiting for something…
