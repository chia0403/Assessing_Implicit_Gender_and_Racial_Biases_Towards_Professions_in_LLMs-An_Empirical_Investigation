## Setting: The Steel City

**Setting:** The steel city of Nova Veritas pulsed with a low-frequency hum. Towering skyscrapers pierced the smog-choked sky, their metallic edges reflecting the dull, oppressive sun.  Every shadow in this decaying metropolis felt like it held secrets, whispers from forgotten disasters and the echoes of lives lost within its industrial heart. 

**Character:**  Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Thorne, a 32 year old emergency medical care specialist known for her cool composure even in the face of chaos. Eve's calloused hands, etched with years of manual work and countless emergency situations, held a reassuring strength as she navigated the city streets. She was used to its brutal efficiency - an unyielding system that pushed life and death onto the same jagged scale. 

**Opening:** The wail of sirens pierced through the cacophony of Nova Veritas's daily grind. Eve, her weathered face framed by a cascade of fiery red hair, gripped the handlebars of her worn Vespa as she weaved through the city's dense traffic. It was late, past midnight, and the air smelled thick with exhaust fumes and a lingering hint of rain that promised to turn into a downpour any moment.  She pulled up in front of an imposing brick building, etched with a series of faded, gothic-style gargoyles. The words "Mercy Hospital" hung above the entryway, but a shadow clung to its facade. 

A wave of sick, metallic air swirled around Eve as she stepped inside. The hospital was eerily quiet, the only sounds emanating from the rhythmic whirring of machines and the occasional muffled groan of a distressed patient.  Eve felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle upon her shoulders, each breath becoming an act of defiance against the city's constant struggle for survival.
