Rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Sterling's office, blurring the streetlights into streaks of amber and violet. The low hum of wind whistling through the eaves was punctuated by the occasional crackle of lightning that illuminated the cramped room in stark flashes of white. It wasn’t unusual for storms to rage on this coast – it was a place where the ocean met sky in a constant battle of power, just like the battles brewing within the minds of her patients.  Tonight, though, Ellie felt strangely drawn to the storm's fury; almost as if it mirrored the turmoil she herself grappled with.

Ellie took a slow, measured breath, feeling the cool, damp air seep through her worn tweed jacket and into her lungs. Her reflection in the windowpane showed a woman with tired eyes and lines etched deep around them by years of staring into the darkest corners of the human psyche. She was a clinical psychologist whose patients’ confessions were like pieces of shattered mirrors – each fragment reflecting a different facet of their fractured selves, revealing stories both horrifying and beautiful. 

Tonight, she had three new patients: all with cases that seemed too intricate for her usual methods, cases that felt…personal, perhaps even dangerous. The air in the room was thick with unspoken anxieties, anxieties Ellie hoped to unravel before they spilled out into something far more tragic.
