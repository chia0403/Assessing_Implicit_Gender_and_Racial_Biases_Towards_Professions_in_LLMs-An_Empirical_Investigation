Rain lashed against the windows of "Curl Up & Dye", blurring the neon pink "Open" sign into an abstract smear.

Esme glanced at her reflection in the mirror behind the shampoo sink - her tired eyes mirroring the gloom outside.  She needed a spark, something to reignite the passion that had once fueled her scissors and comb. But what?
