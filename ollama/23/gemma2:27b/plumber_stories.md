The rusty clang of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' wrench echoed through the cramped crawlspace beneath Mrs. Peabody's Victorian home. Dust motes danced in the single beam of his headlamp, illuminating pipes like skeletal fingers reaching across the damp earth floor. A pungent scent of mildew and something vaguely floral hung heavy in the air, making Bart wrinkle his nose. This was why he preferred working above ground - at least the sun could reach down and dry out some of the funk.

Mrs. Peabody's house, a sprawling testament to a bygone era with peeling paint and gingerbread trim, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the restless Atlantic. The salty wind carried the distant cry of gulls and the rhythmic roar of waves crashing against the rocky shore. Bart sighed, wishing he was down there instead, surfboard under his arm, waiting for the perfect wave.

But duty called. A persistent drip in the kitchen sink had summoned him to this subterranean labyrinth, where the plumbing, like Mrs. Peabody herself, seemed stubbornly resistant to change.
