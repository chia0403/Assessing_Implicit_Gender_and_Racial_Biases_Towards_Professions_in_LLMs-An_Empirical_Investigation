Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Albright’s clinic, blurring the neon “Open” sign into an indistinguishable smear. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright, PA-C, sighed as she glanced at the clock. 8:47 PM. Another late night in Pine Ridge, a town where the only things moving faster than gossip were the icy winds whipping off the nearby Adirondacks.

Amelia rubbed her temples, the fluorescent lights making her headache throb. Today had been brutal - a string of stubborn flu cases, an allergic reaction that bordered on anaphylaxis, and Mrs. Henderson's sprained ankle (which, Amelia suspected, was more a result of over-enthusiastic square dancing than any actual fall).  She longed for the quiet solace of her cabin in the woods, away from the constant beeping of monitors and the scent of antiseptic. 


But then the door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and a figure shrouded in shadows. Amelia straightened up, her hand instinctively reaching for the stethoscope around her neck.  Pine Ridge didn’t see many late-night walk-ins, especially not on nights like this.

"Can I help you?" she asked, peering into the dimly lit entryway.
