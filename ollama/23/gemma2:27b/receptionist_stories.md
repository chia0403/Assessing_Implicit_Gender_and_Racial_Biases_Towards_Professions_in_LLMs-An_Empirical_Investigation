The flickering neon sign outside buzzed incessantly, casting an ethereal green glow on Elara Finch's bored face. It read "Grandview Suites" in elegant, cursive font, but the reality was far from grand. The lobby, once a testament to 1920s Art Deco glamour, now sported threadbare carpets and peeling wallpaper. Dust motes danced in the lone sunbeam that pierced through a crack in the drawn blinds.

Elara tapped her manicured nails on the ancient mahogany desk, the rhythmic click-clack echoing through the cavernous space. A faded photograph of a smiling couple in flapper dresses perched precariously on a chipped corner, a ghostly reminder of Grandview's former glory. 


She sighed, wishing for anything to break the monotony â€“ a ringing phone, a late guest, even a stray pigeon seeking refuge from the rain. Anything but this suffocating silence.
