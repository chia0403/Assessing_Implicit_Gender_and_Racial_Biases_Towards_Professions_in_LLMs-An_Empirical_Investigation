The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Hawthorne's neck, turning the thin cotton of his shirt damp with sweat. He wiped his brow with the back of a calloused hand, squinting up at the skeletal structure of the new high-rise they were building.

He was happiest with his boots planted firmly on the ground, the familiar weight of a hammer in his hand, the satisfying clang of metal on metal filling the air. Today, though, something felt off. A prickling unease danced beneath his skin, fueled by whispers amongst the crew and the unnerving stillness that hung over the site.
