The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the brightly colored alphabet rug in Miss Juniper Rosepetal's kindergarten classroom.  Crayon scribbles adorned every available surface: tables, chairs, even the once pristine whiteboards now sported masterpieces of stick figures and lopsided rainbows.  A symphony of giggles and excited chatter filled the air as twenty five-year-olds buzzed around, their boundless energy a stark contrast to the weariness settling in Juniper's bones.

She loved her job dearly, truly she did. Seeing the world through these tiny humans' eyes was a constant reminder of the magic and wonder that existed in everyday things. But today, after a particularly chaotic week culminating in a glitter explosion during arts and crafts, Juniper yearned for a quiet moment with a steaming cup of chamomile tea.
