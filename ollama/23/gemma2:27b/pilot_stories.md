The air hung thick and heavy, saturated with the scent of salt and diesel. Amelia "Ace" Cartwright squinted through the haze, her weathered face creasing further as she surveyed the churning grey sea. The cargo plane, a hulking behemoth nicknamed "The Kraken," groaned beneath her, its metal skin shuddering against the relentless wind whipping off the Atlantic. She gripped the yoke tighter, knuckles bone-white against the worn leather.

Amelia was no stranger to rough weather, having spent the last decade ferrying everything from medical supplies to volatile chemicals across the globe. But this storm, brewing off the coast of Newfoundland, felt different - primal, angry. It snarled at her, daring her to push through its fury. And Ace Cartwright, with a stubborn glint in her sapphire eyes, never backed down from a challenge.

"Kraken, this is Ace," she barked into the radio, her voice firm despite the tremor running through her. "Winds are picking up. We're gonna have to ride this out for a bit." Her co-pilot, a young man named Finnigan who was still learning the ropes, swallowed nervously beside her.

The Kraken lurched violently, its engines straining against the gale. Ace fought to maintain control, her heart pounding in her chest like a drum solo. Below them, the ocean raged, waves crashing against each other in a furious dance of whitecaps and foam. This wasn't just another delivery run anymore. This was a fight for survival.
