The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of Elias Bartholomew Thorne's foot against the treadle echoed through the dusty shop like a heartbeat. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Widow's Creek buzzed with the morning market, but inside Thorne's Tailor Shop, time seemed to slow. Sunlight filtered through the grimy windowpane, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and casting long shadows across bolts of velvet, silk, and tweed. Elias, his silver hair tied back with a leather thong, hunched over his sewing machine, threading a needle with the practiced ease of someone who had been wielding it for decades. 

The shop itself was a testament to years gone by – worn wooden floors, shelves groaning under the weight of ancient pattern books, and mannequins draped in ghostly garments that whispered of forgotten fashions. The air hung heavy with the scent of beeswax, thread, and the faintest hint of lavender from a sachet tucked away in Elias's waistcoat pocket. Today, however, the usual hum of contentment was tinged with a note of unease. A letter lay unopened on his workbench, its wax seal bearing the crest of the formidable House Blackwood – a family known for their wealth, their eccentricities, and their ruthlessness.
