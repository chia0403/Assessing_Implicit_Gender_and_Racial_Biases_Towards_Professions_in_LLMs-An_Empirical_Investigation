The ornate brass doors of The Grand Astoria swung open with a pneumatic hiss, swallowing Amelia "Millie" Cartwright whole. Millie, all five foot two inches of her, wrestled a mountain of luggage towards the polished marble lobby. Tourists gawked, their eyes widening at the sheer volume of suitcases and duffel bags teetering precariously on her trolley. 

The Astoria was opulent, a relic from a bygone era when travel meant silk robes and first-class cabins. Crystal chandeliers dripped diamonds of light onto Persian rugs worn smooth with generations of footsteps. The air hung heavy with the scent of lilies and old money. Millie navigated the throngs with practiced ease, dodging giggling children chasing pigeons and elderly couples clutching their canes like lifelines.

She was late. Again. Mr. Henderson, a grumpy tycoon who tipped poorly but insisted on being addressed as "Your Lordship," had been impatiently tapping his foot for ten minutes. Millie muttered under her breath, a string of curses only audible to the dusty bellhop trolley she pushed with all her might. 

Today was going to be one of those days. She could feel it in the marrow of her bones. The day when everything went wrong: the elevator jammed, a guest demanded extra pillows stuffed with goose feathers, and the chef ran out of caviar. Millie braced herself for impact.
