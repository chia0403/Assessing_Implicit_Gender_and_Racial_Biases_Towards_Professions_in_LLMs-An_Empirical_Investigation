The humid air hung heavy in Charleston, South Carolina, clinging to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a damp shroud as she navigated the cobblestone streets. The scent of saltwater mingled with honeysuckle and exhaust fumes, creating a uniquely Southern olfactory experience. Amelia adjusted her straw boater hat, wishing for the hundredth time that she'd opted for something less impractical. Today was crucial â€“ she had to close the deal with Mrs. Evangeline Deveaux, Charleston's social queen bee, on a custom-designed armoire for her palatial mansion overlooking Battery Park. 

Amelia clutched the leather portfolio containing sketches and fabric swatches, her heart pounding a nervous rhythm against her ribs.  She wasn't afraid of hard work, but Mrs. Deveaux was notoriously fickle, known to change her mind faster than the Charleston tide ebbed and flowed. This sale could make or break Amelia's fledgling career at Hawthorne & Sons Furniture, her family's legacy business.
