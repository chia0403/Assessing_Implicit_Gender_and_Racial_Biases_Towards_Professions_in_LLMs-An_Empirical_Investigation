The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Elias Finch's chiropractic clinic like a thousand frantic fingers. A sickly yellow light flickered from the lone streetlamp outside, casting elongated shadows that danced grotesquely on the peeling paintwork of the building. Inside, Elias sighed, running a weary hand through his salt-and-pepper hair. The steady thrum of the old ceiling fan did little to dispel the oppressive humidity that seemed to cling to everything in the dusty room.

Elias had been alone all afternoon. His usual stream of patients had dwindled to a trickle thanks to the torrential downpour, leaving him with an unsettling stillness broken only by the occasional groan from his aging treatment table. He glanced at the clock ticking away on the wall â€“ 5:47 PM.

Just as he considered closing up early, a sharp rap echoed through the clinic. Elias frowned, surprised. Who would be out in this weather? Curiosity piqued, he rose from his chair and shuffled towards the door, the floorboards creaking beneath his weight.
