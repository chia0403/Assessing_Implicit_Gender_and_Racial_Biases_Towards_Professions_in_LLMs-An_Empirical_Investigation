Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunshine Daycare Centre, mimicking the storm brewing inside Amelia Rose Cartwright.  

Five-year-old Timmy was in tears again, convinced his beloved stuffed penguin had been "stolen by grumpy goblins." Amelia crouched beside him, her heart aching for the little boy's distress. She smoothed his tangled blonde hair and offered a reassuring smile. “Timmy,” she said gently, "I know it seems scary, but penguins can’t be stolen by grumpy goblins. They live in cold places, far away from here.”

Amelia tried to explain about imaginary creatures, about the power of imagination itself, but Timmy remained unconvinced. He clutched his penguin-shaped pillow tighter, burying his face in its soft feathers. Amelia sighed inwardly. This was turning into one of *those* days. Days where crayons broke, friendships fractured over plastic shovels, and snacks mysteriously vanished. Days that tested even her unwavering patience.  

The daycare itself was a riot of colour and chaos. Brightly painted walls clashed with mismatched furniture, and the air buzzed with the cacophony of children’s voices. Toys lay scattered like fallen soldiers across the worn carpet, testament to the epic battles waged within the playroom. Amelia knew she needed to regain control, but her gaze lingered on Timmy's tear-stained face. Today, logic seemed a distant shore. 

Today, magic was needed.
