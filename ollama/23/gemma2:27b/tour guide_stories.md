The air hung thick with humidity, heavy as a wool blanket draped over Florence's ancient bones. Isabella Rossi sighed, adjusting the strap of her satchel that contained meticulously prepared maps and brochures for today's tour group. 

She stood before the imposing bronze doors of the Baptistery, their intricate carvings depicting scenes from the Bible in stark relief against the shimmering morning sun. Tourists milled about, cameras clicking like cicadas on a warm summer night. Isabella smiled, her practiced warmth softening the edges of her weariness. Today was the start of a new season, and she felt the familiar thrill course through her veins - the anticipation of sharing Florence's hidden secrets with wide-eyed travelers.

But today felt different. A prickling sensation danced at the nape of her neck, an unsettling feeling that something wasn't quite right. Perhaps it was the cryptic postcard she had received earlier that morning, a single image of the Duomo's dome etched against a blood red sunset, no words accompanying the ominous scene. Or maybe it was the sudden influx of tourists, their faces obscured by wide-brimmed hats and dark sunglasses, their voices hushed and hurried. 


Whatever it was, Isabella couldn't shake the feeling that Florence held its breath today, waiting for something to unfold.
