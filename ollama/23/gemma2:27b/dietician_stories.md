Rain lashed against the windows of Evelyn Rosewater's cozy dietetics office, blurring the vibrant autumn foliage outside into a swirling watercolor. The scent of cinnamon and maple syrup wafted from the corner where Evelyn kept a small potpourri bowl, a comforting counterpoint to the storm raging beyond. A stack of client files sat precariously on her desk, each file representing a journey towards better health, a battle against cravings and societal pressures. Evelyn sighed, pushing back a strand of auburn hair that had escaped her braid.  She loved her work, helping people find balance and joy in their relationship with food, but today, even the warmth of her office couldn't quite banish the nagging feeling of unease. 


A sharp rap on the door startled Evelyn.  She glanced at the clock: 4:55 pm, five minutes before closing time. "Come in!" she called out, straightening her cardigan and bracing herself for a last-minute appointment cancellation or someone needing an emergency snack recommendation. Instead, a tall figure with rain-soaked hair and piercing blue eyes stepped into the office. He held a crumpled paper bag in his hand, water dripping from its edges onto the welcome mat.  Evelyn instinctively knew this wasn't just another client. This man carried a weight far heavier than any dietary concern she had ever encountered.
