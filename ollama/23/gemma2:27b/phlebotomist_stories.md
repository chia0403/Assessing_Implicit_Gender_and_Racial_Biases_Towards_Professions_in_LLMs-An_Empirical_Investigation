The fluorescent lights of Mercy Hospital hummed, casting a sterile glow over Elara Vance as she prepared her station. A symphony of beeps and whirs filled the air – EKG monitors chirping, IV pumps steadily clicking – a soundtrack to the quiet drama unfolding in each room.  Elara, with her gentle touch and calming voice, was a maestro of this particular orchestra.

She smoothed the crisp white paper on the examination table, ensuring it lay perfectly flat. The faint scent of disinfectant mingled with something sweeter, perhaps lavender hand sanitizer, a small comfort in the sometimes-stark environment. Today felt different. A knot of anticipation tightened in her stomach. This wasn't just another routine blood draw.

This was Patient Zero.
