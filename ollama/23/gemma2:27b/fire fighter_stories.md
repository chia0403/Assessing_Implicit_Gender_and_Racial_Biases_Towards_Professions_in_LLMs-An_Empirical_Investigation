Smoke stung Captain Amelia “Ace” Ramirez’s nostrils as she wrestled the firehose, its weight pulling against her like an angry beast.  The roar of flames devouring the old Victorian home was deafening, punctuated by the occasional crackle and groan of timbers surrendering to the inferno. 

The narrow street, cobbled and slick with icy runoff from recent snowfall, shimmered under the harsh glare of the firetruck’s spotlights. Beyond the swirling smoke and dancing orange light, Ace could just make out the worried faces of neighbors huddled on snow-covered porches, their breath misting in the frigid air.  

Tonight wasn't just another blaze. This was the third fire in as many weeks, all eerily similar: old houses, vacant for months, consumed by a relentless and seemingly unstoppable fire. And each one had started in the dead of night.
