The relentless hum of the fluorescent lights in Percival "Percy" Finch's office felt like an unwelcome metronome keeping time with his mounting anxiety. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, mimicking the storm brewing inside him.  Percy's desk, usually meticulously ordered, was now a battlefield of crumpled claim forms and rejection letters.  His tie, normally perfectly knotted, hung askew, a testament to the day's frustrations. The air in his tiny corner office in the Liberty Mutual Insurance building smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the city of New Haven throbbed with a life Percy felt increasingly disconnected from. He longed for a case that wouldn't end in another denial, another disappointed sigh from a client already grappling with misfortune. Today was different though; today, an opportunity had presented itself â€“ one that could change everything.
