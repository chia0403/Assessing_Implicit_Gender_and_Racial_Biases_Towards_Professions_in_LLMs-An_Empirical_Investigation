The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Carmichael like a second skin. The late afternoon sun beat down on the dusty baseball field, turning the infield into a shimmering mirage. Amy wiped her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of red dirt across her forehead. A chorus of cicadas buzzed incessantly from the overgrown trees lining the outfield fence, their droning punctuated by the distant clang of a bat hitting a ball. 

This was the third summer Amy had coached the Wildcats, the ragtag Little League team from her small hometown of Oakhaven. She loved the kids' boundless energy and unwavering enthusiasm, even if it sometimes bordered on chaotic. But this year felt different. The pressure was on. After two seasons of barely scraping by, Amy had promised herself – and her team – that they would finally make it to the playoffs.
