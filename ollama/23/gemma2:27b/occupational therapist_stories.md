Rain lashed against the windows of the St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, mimicking the tumultuous storm brewing inside Evelyn Rosalind Pierce.  She stared at the file in her hands, her brow furrowed with concern. Her patient, Thomas Blackwood, was due for his first session after a devastating motorcycle accident. The reports were grim - fractured leg, severe concussion, and possible cognitive impairment. 

Evelyn, known to her patients as Evie, felt a familiar surge of determination mixed with trepidation.  St. Jude's, nestled in the rolling hills just outside Asheville, North Carolina, was known for its innovative approach to rehabilitation, but even they couldn't guarantee a full recovery for someone with Thomas's injuries. 

She took a deep breath and straightened her crisp white coat. It was time to face the storm, both inside and out.  She had to help Thomas navigate this new terrain, regain his strength, and hopefully, rediscover himself.   The journey wouldn't be easy, but Evie was no stranger to challenges. After all, she believed in miracles, even the ones disguised as slow, steady progress.
