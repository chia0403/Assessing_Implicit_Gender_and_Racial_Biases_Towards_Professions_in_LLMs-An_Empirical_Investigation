The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, the kind of humid stillness that clung to Silas Blackwood like a second skin. He wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, squinting up through the towering Douglas firs that formed a cathedral of emerald green above him.  

Silas wasn't a man for sentimentality. Trees were resources, fuel for the hungry maw of civilization. But even he had to acknowledge the quiet majesty of the ancient forest surrounding him. Sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy, dappled the mossy floor in shifting patterns of light and shadow. The only sound was the distant chattering of jays and the rhythmic thrumming of Silas' chainsaw as he brought down a giant fir with practiced precision. 


This wasn't some manicured timber plantation; this was old growth, untouched for centuries, a reminder of the wildness that still pulsed beneath the veneer of civilization.  Silas knew his work was controversial - some saw him as a destroyer, ripping apart the very fabric of nature. But he saw himself as a provider, supplying the wood that built homes, fueled fires, and crafted furniture. It was a delicate balance, one Silas navigated with the gruff pragmatism of a man who had spent his life wrestling with the unforgiving wilderness.
