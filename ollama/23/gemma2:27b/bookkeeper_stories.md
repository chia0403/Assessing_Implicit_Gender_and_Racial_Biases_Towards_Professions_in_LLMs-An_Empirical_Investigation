Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Bartholomew Quillfeather's cramped office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his heart. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wool, stale coffee, and fear. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Grimhaven shimmered under flickering gaslight, reflecting the city's perpetual gloom. Bartholomew, a man perpetually hunched over his ledgers like a withered gargoyle, stared at the crumpled note clutched in his trembling hand.

"Meet me at midnight. The Raven's Nest. Come alone." 


The message was unsigned, its starkness echoing the dread gnawing at Bartholomew's insides. He knew this couldn't be good. Why else would someone summon him to the Raven's Nest, Grimhaven's notorious gambling den, in the dead of night? Bartholomew Quillfeather, a man whose life revolved around the meticulous balance sheets of merchants and traders, was hopelessly out of his depth. Yet, something in the cryptic note compelled him â€“ a sliver of hope buried beneath layers of anxiety. Perhaps this was his chance to break free from the monotonous drudgery of his existence. Or perhaps it was a fatal mistake waiting to happen.
