Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Ramirez's small office overlooking a perpetually grey Seattle skyline. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and damp wool, remnants of Evie's last patient – an elderly fisherman struggling to regain strength in his arthritic hands. Despite the gloomy weather mirroring her mood, Evie couldn't help but feel a surge of satisfaction as she watched him clench his fist, a faint smile gracing his weathered face.  

It was moments like these that reminded her why she'd chosen this path - to mend broken bodies and rebuild shattered confidence. Yet, today, something felt off. A knot of unease twisted in her stomach, a premonition she couldn't shake. As the clock ticked towards the end of her workday, a new patient was scheduled – one whose file simply read "Mr. X" and who had requested complete anonymity. Curiosity warred with apprehension within Evie, leaving her feeling strangely vulnerable as she waited for the mystery client to arrive.
