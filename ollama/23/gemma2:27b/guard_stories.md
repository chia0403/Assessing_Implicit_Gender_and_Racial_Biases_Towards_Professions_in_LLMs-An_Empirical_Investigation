Rain lashed against the granite walls of Castle Blackwood, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray. The wind howled through the ancient ramparts, rattling the rusted bars of the gatehouse where Thaddeus Blackthorn shivered beneath his threadbare cloak. He wasn't meant for this life. Thaddeus dreamed of dusty libraries and forgotten tomes, not cold stone and the stench of damp earth. Yet, here he was, a lowly guard tasked with protecting a castle steeped in shadows and whispered secrets.

Tonight, however, something felt different. The storm raged with an unsettling ferocity, and even the torches lining the battlements flickered feebly against the howling wind. Thaddeus tightened his grip on his rusty spear, his heart pounding a steady tattoo against his ribs. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, lurking just beyond the veil of the storm.
