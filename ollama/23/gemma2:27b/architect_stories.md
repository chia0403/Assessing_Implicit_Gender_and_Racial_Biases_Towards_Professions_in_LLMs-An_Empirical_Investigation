Rain lashed against the arched windows of Beatrice Rosalind Alcott's studio, mimicking the tempest raging within her.  Her blueprints lay scattered on the massive drafting table, a chaotic symphony of lines and angles that refused to coalesce into anything resembling order. The project – a sprawling eco-resort nestled in the heart of the Amazon rainforest – had seemed like a dream come true when she'd first landed it. Now, six months in, Beatrice was drowning in a sea of logistical nightmares, environmental concerns, and clashing stakeholder visions.

Her studio, perched atop a skyscraper overlooking the Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden, offered a breathtaking view even on the dreariest days, but tonight it felt like a cruel reminder of her own internal turmoil. Beatrice, known for her meticulous designs and unwavering composure, was teetering on the brink of despair.  Could she salvage this project, or would it become the monument to failure that haunted her dreams?
