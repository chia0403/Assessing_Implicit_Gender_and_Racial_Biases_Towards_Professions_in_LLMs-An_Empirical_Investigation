The aroma of caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the yeasty scent of rising dough. Amelia Beatrice Cartwright hummed along to the radio, her flour-dusted hands expertly kneading the brioche she'd been perfecting for weeks.

Sunlight streamed through the windowpanes of "Amelia's Bakehouse," bathing the cozy shop in a golden glow. But Amelia wasn't focused on the idyllic scene outside; her mind was consumed with the intricate pattern she was attempting to create on the brioche, hoping it would finally earn the admiration of her formidable mentor, Madame Dubois.
