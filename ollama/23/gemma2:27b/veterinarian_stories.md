Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's rural veterinary clinic, blurring the already fading twilight into an impressionistic watercolour. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the rusty sign above the door that read simply: "Cartwright Veterinary Services - All Creatures Great and Small." Inside, the air was thick with the mingled scents of disinfectant, hay, and something distinctly canine.

Amy, her blonde hair escaping from its braid and plastered to her forehead, sighed as she surveyed the scene. Three anxious sheepdogs huddled in a corner, whimpering nervously at the storm's fury. A grumpy goat lay sprawled on a padded table, chewing listlessly on a bale of hay. And perched precariously on Amy's shoulder was a one-winged robin, its tiny heart beating frantically against her chest.

Tonight was proving to be one of those nights where every creature in the county seemed to need her help simultaneously. Just as she thought things couldn't get any crazier, the door burst open with a bang, letting in a gust of wind and a figure dripping with rain.
