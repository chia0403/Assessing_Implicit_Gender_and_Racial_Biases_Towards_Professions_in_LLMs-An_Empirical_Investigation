The July sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy outline of the Chicago skyline stretching out before him. Eli perched precariously on the edge of a steeply pitched roof, shingles shimmering in the oppressive heat. He gripped his trusty hammer with calloused hands, the worn wood familiar and comforting. Below him, the bustling city throbbed with life â€“ car horns blared, sirens wailed, and the distant chatter of pedestrians rose like a murmur. But up here, Eli found a strange solace.  He was alone with the sky, the wind whispering secrets through the eaves, and the rhythmic clang of his hammer against shingles providing a steady counterpoint to the city's chaos.

Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Eli's spine as he surveyed the dilapidated building before him. It was an old Victorian mansion, its once proud facade now faded and crumbling. Something about the boarded-up windows, the overgrown ivy creeping across the walls like skeletal fingers, and the unsettling silence emanating from within sent a shiver down his spine.
