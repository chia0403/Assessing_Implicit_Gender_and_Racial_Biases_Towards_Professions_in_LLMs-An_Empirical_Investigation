The rain hammered against the warped glass panes of Professor Eleanor Cavendish's office window, mimicking the insistent drumming in her chest. Stacks of ancient, leather-bound tomes threatened to topple from her cluttered desk, their titles barely visible under a layer of dust and forgotten notes. Outside, the wind howled through the gnarled branches of the ancient oak that dominated the University of Aethelred's courtyard, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cobblestone path. 

Eleanor stared at the cryptic symbol etched onto the faded parchment before her, its lines swirling like smoke. The artifact had arrived anonymously a week ago, tucked inside a battered wooden crate addressed simply to "The Keeper of Forgotten Lore." A shiver ran down her spine despite the oppressive heat radiating from the ancient fireplace. This wasn't just another obscure text; this symbol felt...alive.
