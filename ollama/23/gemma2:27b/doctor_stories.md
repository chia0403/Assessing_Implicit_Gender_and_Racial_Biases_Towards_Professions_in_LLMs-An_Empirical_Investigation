Rain lashed against the warped glass panes of Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Thorne's office window, mirroring the turmoil brewing within her. The once pristine white walls were now streaked with damp, their cheerful yellow accents seeming to mock the grey gloom settling over everything.

This wasn't just any storm; it was the kind that seeped into your bones and whispered ancient, unsettling secrets. And tonight, those whispers seemed directed at her.
