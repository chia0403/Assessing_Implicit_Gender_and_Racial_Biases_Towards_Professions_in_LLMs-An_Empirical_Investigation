The air hung thick with static, mirroring the tension humming in Elias Thorne's chest. Outside his workshop window, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly on the dusty town of Harmony Gulch, but inside, it was a cool haven of buzzing transistors and flickering vacuum tubes. He adjusted a dial on the vintage Hallicrafters SX-88 receiver, the faint hiss of distant voices momentarily breaking through the etheric fog.

Elias wasn't just any radio technician. In Harmony Gulch, he was known as "the Whisperer," a man who could coax signals out of dead air and weave them into stories that filled the lonely hearts of its residents. Tonight, though, the whispers weren't coming. The usual symphony of distant broadcasts – BBC news, polka music from Omaha, even the faint crackle of a ham radio operator in Idaho – were silent.  A shiver ran down Elias's spine. Something wasn't right.
