Rain hammered against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's third-grade classroom, blurring the bright autumn leaves outside into watercolor smudges.  A low rumble of thunder echoed through the building, making a few of her students jump in their seats.

Eleanor smiled reassuringly at them, then turned back to the board where "The Life Cycle of a Butterfly" was scrawled in bold, colorful letters. She'd planned an elaborate lesson complete with caterpillars in a mesh enclosure and pipe cleaner butterflies they could make themselves. But the storm raging outside had cut the power, plunging the room into an eerie semi-darkness punctuated only by flashes of lightning.

Disappointment tugged at Eleanor's heart. Her students had been so excited about the butterfly project.  She glanced around at their eager faces, illuminated by the faint light filtering through the windows. The storm outside wasn't going to dampen their spirits – or hers – not today.
