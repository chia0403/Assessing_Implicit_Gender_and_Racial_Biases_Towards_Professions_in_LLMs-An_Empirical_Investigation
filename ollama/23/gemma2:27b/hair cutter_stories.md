The humid New Orleans air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets. Sunlight slanted through the gauzy curtains of 'Curl Up & Dye,' casting emerald stripes across Eloise Beaumont's worn, wooden workstation. Outside, Frenchmen Street thrummed with life - the clanging laughter from a nearby bar mingling with the mournful wail of a saxophone. But inside, all was quiet save for the gentle snip of Eloise's shears and the rhythmic hum of her hairdryer.  Eloise, with her fiery red curls piled atop her head like a rebellious crown and eyes the color of stormy seas, surveyed her work with a critical eye. 

Mr. Dubois, a regular with thinning hair and a penchant for quoting Shakespeare, sat patiently in her chair. He was due for his usual "Caesar cut," Eloise thought wryly, a style she'd perfected over countless sessions, but one that never failed to make her wonder about the depths of his theatrical soul.
