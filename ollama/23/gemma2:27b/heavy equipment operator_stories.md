The Arizona sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's weathered neck as he maneuvered the Caterpillar D11 dozer across the parched earth. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling columns of red dirt against the endless blue sky. The air thrummed with the powerful roar of the engine and the rhythmic screech of metal teeth biting into compacted sand. Silas, a man built like a seasoned oak tree, squinted through the sweat stinging his eyes, his calloused hands expertly guiding the behemoth machine. He'd been operating heavy equipment since he was barely old enough to shave, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather before him. This particular job site, however, felt different. There was a palpable tension in the air, a sense that something unseen lurked beneath the desolate landscape.


The wind carried the faint scent of sagebrush and something else â€“ metallic, acrid. Silas frowned. He'd smelled it before, years ago on another dig out near Yuma. It always meant trouble.
