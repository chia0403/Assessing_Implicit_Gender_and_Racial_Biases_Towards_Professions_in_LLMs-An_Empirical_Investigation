Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm raging within her patient. The air hung thick with unspoken tension, punctuated only by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Eleanor's pen against her notepad. Her office, perched on the fifth floor overlooking a grey and dreary London street, was a sanctuary of calm amidst the city's chaos. Bookshelves lined the walls, overflowing with worn volumes on psychology and philosophy, their titles whispering tales of the human psyche. A plush armchair sat opposite Eleanor's antique desk, its deep burgundy velvet inviting vulnerability. 

But today, vulnerability felt miles away. Across from her sat Daniel Blackwood, a man whose sharp features were etched with years of suppressed pain. He clutched his coffee mug like a lifeline, knuckles white against the porcelain. His eyes, once a vibrant emerald green, now held the dull sheen of despair. Eleanor leaned forward slightly, her own gaze steady and reassuring.  "Daniel," she began, her voice soft yet firm, "tell me what brought you here today."
