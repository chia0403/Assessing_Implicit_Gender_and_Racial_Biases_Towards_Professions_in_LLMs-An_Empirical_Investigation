Rain lashed against Alistair Thornwood's worn canvas jacket as he surveyed the devastation. The meticulously manicured rose gardens of Blackwood Manor, usually a symphony of color and fragrance, were now a sodden mess. Petals were torn from their stems, swirling in muddy pools, and the once proud hedges sagged under the weight of water.

Alistair, with his weathered face framed by greying hair and hands perpetually stained earth-brown, felt a familiar pang of despair. Blackwood Manor was more than just his place of work; it was his sanctuary. For years, he'd poured his heart and soul into its grounds, coaxing beauty from the earth, nurturing every leaf and bloom. But today, the storm had ripped through his haven like an angry god, leaving behind a trail of destruction.

He sighed, the sound swallowed by the relentless drumming of rain. The manor itself loomed above him, a gothic silhouette against the bruised sky, its windows dark and lifeless. Alistair knew Lady Blackwood wouldn't be pleased. She was known for her exacting standards and her icy demeanor.

But Alistair wasn't one to wallow. He straightened his back, the ache in his joints forgotten for the moment. There was work to be done. The storm may have raged, but the gardens would rise again. They always did.
