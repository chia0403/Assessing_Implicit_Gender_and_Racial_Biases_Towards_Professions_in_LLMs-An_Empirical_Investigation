Rain lashed against the ornate arched windows of The Grand Blackwood Hotel, blurring the glittering cityscape below into an impressionist painting. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient leadpanes in their frames. Inside, however, all was warm and inviting: a roaring fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows across the Persian rug, and the air hung heavy with the scent of lilies and polished mahogany.

Behind the grand oak concierge desk stood Elara Kensington, her crisp white uniform impeccable despite the storm raging outside. Her ebony hair was pulled back into a severe bun, framing high cheekbones and piercing emerald eyes that missed nothing. For twenty years, Elara had been the heart and soul of The Grand Blackwood, anticipating guests' needs before they even arose. She knew every secret passage, every hidden nook, and every quirky habit of the hotel's long-standing clientele.

Tonight, however, a tension hung in the air thicker than the smoke curling from the fireplace. A mysterious guest was due to arrive, shrouded in secrecy and whispered rumours. Elara felt a prickle of anticipation mixed with unease â€“ something about this arrival felt different, destined to disrupt the tranquil order of The Grand Blackwood.
