The acrid scent of exhaust fumes mingled with the sweet perfume of jasmine, a bizarre olfactory cocktail that was all too familiar to Isabella "Izzy" Flores. She stood on the bustling corner of Calle Ocho and SW 1st Avenue, her notebook clutched in one hand, pen poised above a fresh page. Miami thrummed around her: salsa music spilling from open doorways, tourists snapping photos of Art Deco architecture, locals haggling over mangoes at fruit stands. It was a vibrant, chaotic tapestry Izzy both loved and loathed.

Izzy had been chasing this story for weeks – whispers of a smuggling ring operating right under the noses of Miami's elite. It seemed implausible, even ludicrous: art treasures vanishing from private collections, replaced with masterful forgeries, all without a trace.  But something about the rumors gnawed at Izzy, a journalist who prided herself on sniffing out truth where others saw only smoke and mirrors. 

Today, her source – a jittery art dealer named Miguel – was supposed to meet her at a hidden cafe tucked away in Little Havana. Izzy adjusted the strap of her worn satchel, its weight reassuringly familiar. She scanned the faces passing by, searching for a man with nervous eyes and a fedora tilted low over his brow. This meeting could be her big break, or it could lead her down a dangerous path she wasn't prepared to tread. But Izzy Flores never backed down from a story, no matter how risky it seemed.
