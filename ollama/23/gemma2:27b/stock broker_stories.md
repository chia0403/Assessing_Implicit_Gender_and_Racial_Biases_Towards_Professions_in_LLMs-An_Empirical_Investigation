The air hung thick with cigar smoke and the murmur of whispered negotiations in the mahogany-paneled conference room.  Through the arched window overlooking Wall Street, Amelia Davenport could see the midday sun glinting off the steel and glass canyons below. The rhythmic thrumming of traffic sounded like a frantic heartbeat against the quiet tension within the room. Amelia, her sleek blonde hair pulled back tight in a bun, adjusted the silk scarf at her throat and leaned forward, her emerald eyes fixed on the spreadsheet projected onto the wall.

The numbers danced before her - a volatile symphony of green and red. The market was a fickle beast today, swinging wildly between cautious optimism and outright panic. Amelia's client, Mr. Hawthorne, a man whose fortune had been built on ruthless efficiency and calculated risks, tapped his manicured finger impatiently against the table.  

"What's your play, Miss Davenport?" he asked, his voice sharp as a honed knife. "Give me something to sink my teeth into."


This was it. Amelia's moment. The success of this deal could mean another hefty bonus and solidify her place as one of the rising stars in Hawthorne & Sterling. But failure...failure meant jeopardizing everything she had worked so hard for.
