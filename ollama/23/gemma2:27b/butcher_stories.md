The scent of iron and rosemary hung thick in the air, clinging to Bartholomew "Barty" Finch like a second skin.  He stood behind the counter of Finch's Fine Meats, his broad hands expertly cleaving a side of beef into perfect roasts. The shop bell jingled merrily as Mrs. Hawthorne bustled in, her pug Beatrice snuffling at her heels.  

"Morning, Barty," she chirped, her eyes twinkling. "Anything particularly good today?" 

Barty grinned, his handlebar moustache twitching with amusement. Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven were still slumbering under a thin veil of morning mist, but inside Finch's Fine Meats, life was already in full swing. The window display boasted plump sausages, glistening hams, and cuts of meat so tender they practically begged to be devoured.

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Barty's spine as he weighed out a pound of pork loin for Mrs. Hawthorne. He couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was brewing in the heart of Oakhaven, a darkness lurking beneath the surface of their quaint village life.
