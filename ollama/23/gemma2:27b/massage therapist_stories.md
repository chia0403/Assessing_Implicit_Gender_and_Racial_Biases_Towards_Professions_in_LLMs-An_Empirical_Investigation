Rain hammered against the dusty windowpanes of Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather's studio, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display against the grime. The air inside was thick with the scent of lavender and sandalwood oil, a comforting aroma that Sera usually found soothing. Today, however, it did little to quell the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach.

Her tiny massage therapy studio, tucked away in a forgotten corner of New Orleans' vibrant French Quarter, felt unbearably small and suffocating. Business had been slow for weeks. The usual steady stream of tourists seeking relief from aching backs and sore feet after days exploring the city's cobbled streets had dwindled to a trickle. Sera could barely afford to keep the lights on, let alone buy groceries. 


The rhythmic drumming of the rain echoed her own anxieties - relentless, unforgiving, and threatening to drown her hopes. A shiver ran down her spine despite the muggy heat.  Tonight was Mardi Gras Eve, the night before the city exploded in a whirlwind of music, dancing, and revelry. Sera had hoped for a last-minute surge in clients, but so far, her appointment book remained distressingly blank.

Suddenly, a sharp rapping at the door jolted her out of her despair.  Her heart leaped â€“ a client!
