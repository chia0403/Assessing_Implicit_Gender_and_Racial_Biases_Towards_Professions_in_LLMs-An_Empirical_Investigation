Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thorne's office, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of greasy light from the neon sign flickering outside. The scent of stale cigarette smoke and cheap whiskey hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the faint tang of desperation that clung to every client who stumbled through his door.

Elias, a man whose face bore the map of a thousand sleepless nights, leaned back in his creaky chair, the springs groaning in protest. He swirled the amber liquid left in his glass, the ice cubes rattling like bone dice. His eyes, the colour of storm clouds after a lightning strike, were fixed on the doorway. 

He'd seen it all - infidelity, missing persons, embezzlement, even the occasional stray ghost. But tonight, something felt different. The air crackled with an unspoken tension. Elias had a feeling tonight's case wouldn't be as simple as finding a runaway husband or retrieving a stolen necklace.  Tonight promised something darker, something that might burrow beneath his skin and stay there, long after the rain stopped falling.
