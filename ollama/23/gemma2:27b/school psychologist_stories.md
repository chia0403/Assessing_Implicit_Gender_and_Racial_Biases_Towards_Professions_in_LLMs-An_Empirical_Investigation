The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mixing with the faint aroma of crayons and overripe bananas from a forgotten lunchbox.  Eleanor Beatrice Thorne, PsyD, sighed as she adjusted the overflowing stack of files on her desk. The window overlooking the playground offered a view of shrieking children engaged in a boisterous game of tag, their laughter a stark contrast to the hushed tension that permeated her office. Today was shaping up to be another long one.

Eleanor was the sole school psychologist for Willow Creek Elementary, a sprawling brick building nestled on the outskirts of a sleepy town in Oregon.  Willow Creek was renowned for its idyllic setting and close-knit community, but beneath the surface lurked a host of unseen struggles that Eleanor navigated daily. From undiagnosed learning disabilities to bullying incidents and the anxieties plaguing preteens in an increasingly complex world, her days were filled with unraveling the intricate threads of young minds. 


Today, however, a new case loomed large â€“ a student who had inexplicably withdrawn from all social interaction, spending recesses huddled alone in the library with his nose buried deep in a book. His name was Ezra Blackwood, and something about his haunted eyes and quiet demeanor tugged at Eleanor's heartstrings.  She sensed there was more to Ezra's story than met the eye, a mystery waiting to be unraveled.
