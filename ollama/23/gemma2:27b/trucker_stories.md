The neon sign of the Last Chance Diner flickered sickly green against the endless black canvas of the Nevada desert. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt parking lot, swirling like spectral apparitions under the oppressive glare of the sodium streetlights. Inside, Beatrice "Bea" Callahan, her calloused hands wrapped around a lukewarm mug of coffee, watched the lonely tumbleweeds roll past. Her rig, "The Iron Butterfly," a gleaming behemoth with chrome accents and a custom paint job depicting a monarch butterfly in flight, stood sentinel by the pumps. 

It was midnight, and Bea was itching to hit the road again. She'd been stuck in this godforsaken town for three days thanks to a busted alternator, her patience wearing thin like the tread on her ancient tires. The diner was filled with the usual suspects: weary travelers, truckers swapping stories, and locals nursing their sorrows at the counter. 

But Bea couldn't focus. Something felt off. A prickling sensation danced on the back of her neck, a sense that she wasn't alone in her unease. Outside, a sudden gust of wind rattled the windows, sending shivers down her spine.  The desert was whispering its secrets tonight.
