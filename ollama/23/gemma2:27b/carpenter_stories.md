The scent of sawdust hung thick in the air, a comforting aroma that Elias Hawthorne had known his entire life. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of his workshop, illuminating the workbench where he was meticulously carving the delicate floral motif on a rocking chair. Outside, the salty tang of the Maine coast drifted in, carried by a breeze rustling through the gnarled oak trees lining his property. The rhythmic thrumming of Elias' chisel against wood was punctuated by the distant cries of gulls and the occasional bark from his scruffy terrier, Finn, curled up asleep by the woodstove.

Elias paused, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. He ran his fingers over the smooth curve of the chair arm, admiring the intricate pattern he'd painstakingly created. It was for Mrs. O'Malley down the road, who had lost her husband last year and wanted something special to remember him by. He knew she'd cherish it.  

But today, a familiar unease gnawed at Elias. Something felt different, off-kilter in his usually peaceful world. It started with a string of odd dreams â€“ vivid visions of storms brewing over the sea, of whispers carried on the wind, and an unsettling sense of impending change. Now, as he looked out the window, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to shift, forever altering the quiet rhythm of his life in this small coastal town.
