The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Beatrice Thorne’s head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of ValueMart. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of discount cleaning supplies, wilting produce, and desperation. It was Tuesday afternoon, which meant the usual post-lunch lull before the after-school rush descended like a swarm of ravenous locusts. Elara idly tapped her acrylic nails on the counter, counting down the seconds until she could escape this beige purgatory and retreat to her cramped apartment above Mrs. Goldstein’s bakery. 


The squeak of a shopping cart wheel jolted her back to reality. An elderly woman, hunched over like a question mark, shuffled towards Elara's register, her basket overflowing with canned peaches, cat food, and a single wilting bouquet of carnations.  Elara plastered on her best customer service smile – the one that didn’t quite reach her weary eyes.

“Afternoon ma’am,” she chirped, already reaching for the scanner. “Find everything alright today?”
