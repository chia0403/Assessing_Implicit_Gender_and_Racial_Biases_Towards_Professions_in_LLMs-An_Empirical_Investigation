Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Smile Bright Dental," blurring the neon sign into an indecipherable smear of color. Inside, Eleanor Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging up the stainless steel instruments laid out on her tray. Another dreary Tuesday in Southbridge, a town where hope seemed to have rusted away along with the aging water pipes.

Eleanor ran a gloved hand over the chipped enamel of a molar model, its plastic teeth stained an unnerving shade of brown. She'd been a dental hygienist for ten years now, her once-bright idealism dulled by years of treating cavities and gum disease in patients who seemed more interested in their smartphones than their oral health. Today felt particularly bleak. The waiting room was empty, the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drip from a leaky faucet. Eleanor longed for something – anything – to break the monotony.
