Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's General Hospital, mirroring the storm raging within Eloise Marie Beaumont. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the linoleum floor of the nurses' station, amplifying the oppressive atmosphere. Eloise scrubbed at a stubborn coffee stain on her uniform, her movements mechanical and devoid of emotion. A year ago, she would have relished the adrenaline rush of a stormy night in the ER. Now, the chaos only deepened the hollowness that had settled within her. 

The incessant beeping of monitors blended with hushed whispers and frantic footsteps - the symphony of St. Jude's on a bad night. Eloise barely registered it all. Her mind was locked on a single, haunting image: a young boy, his eyes wide with terror as he fought for every breath, slipping away under her care. The memory was a venomous serpent coiled around her heart, squeezing the joy and compassion out of her.  


Tonight, she felt like a ghost in scrubs, moving through familiar motions but disconnected from the urgency around her.
