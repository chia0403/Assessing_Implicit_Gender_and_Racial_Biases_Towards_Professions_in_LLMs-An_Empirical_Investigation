The rusty ceiling fan whirred above Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' head, stirring the thick, humid air of his barbershop. Outside, cicadas shrieked their relentless summer song, punctuated by the occasional honk of a car struggling through the midday heat. Bart leaned against his worn leather chair, wiping sweat from his brow with a faded paisley handkerchief. The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of ozone from the nearby thunderstorm brewing on the horizon. 

His shop, "Bart's Blades," was tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Willow Creek, a sleepy town where time seemed to move at a slower pace. The faded red and white striped awning outside cast dancing shadows across the dusty windowpanes, while inside, chipped porcelain barber poles lined the walls, adorned with sepia-toned photographs of men with slicked-back hair and confident smiles. 

Bart's hands were calloused but gentle, his touch honed by years of wielding scissors and razors. He knew every curve and contour of a man's face, every stray hair that needed trimming, every whisper of insecurity hidden beneath bravado. Today, though, the usual buzz of conversation was absent. The shop sat empty, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of the antique clock on the wall and Bart's own restless thoughts.

He hadn't seen a customer in hours. A strange unease settled over him, a feeling that something wasn't quite right. This wasn't just a slow day; it was an unsettling silence, one that seemed to whisper warnings on the wind.
