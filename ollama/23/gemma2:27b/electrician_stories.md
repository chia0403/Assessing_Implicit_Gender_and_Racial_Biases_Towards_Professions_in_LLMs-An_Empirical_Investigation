Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the old workshop, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the cavernous space. Elias Thornhill, his calloused hands dusted with graphite, squinted at the flickering fluorescent light above. The bulb, ancient and weary like himself, sputtered intermittently, casting long, dancing shadows across the workbench cluttered with tools and half-disassembled appliances.

Elias, a man weathered by years of crawling through dusty attics and wrestling with temperamental wiring, was on his last call of the day. A frantic phone call from Mrs. Peabody down the street about her refrigerator dying had dragged him out into this miserable storm. He sighed, the air thick with the smell of ozone and damp earth.  Mrs. Peabody's freezer full of frozen dinners wouldn't thaw itself, he supposed.

He reached for his trusty multimeter, a battered tool that had seen more repairs than any appliance in town, and prepared to delve into the electric guts of her refrigerator.
