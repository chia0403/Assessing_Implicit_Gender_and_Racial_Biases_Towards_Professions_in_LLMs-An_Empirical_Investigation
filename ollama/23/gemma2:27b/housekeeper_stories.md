Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the old Victorian mansion, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Eleanor Finchley. She wrung out her already soaked dishcloth with a sigh, the grey water swirling down the porcelain sink like a miniature whirlpool. Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the rain-streaked glass, illuminating the cavernous kitchen she'd spent countless hours scrubbing, polishing, and restoring to its former glory.
