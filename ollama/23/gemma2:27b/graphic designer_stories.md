Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon cityscape outside into an Impressionist painting of swirling reds and yellows. Eleanor Vance sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she stared out at the downpour. Her tiny apartment in the heart of Seoul felt claustrophobic tonight, the walls seemingly closing in on her with every boom of thunder. She was drowning in deadlines, her creative well bone dry.

Eleanor, a graphic designer for a trendy independent magazine, prided herself on coming up with innovative and eye-catching layouts. But lately, inspiration had eluded her. The blank screen in front of her mocked her lack of progress, the cursor blinking accusingly like a judgemental eye. 

The story she was assigned – an exposé on the burgeoning underground art scene in Seoul – promised to be captivating, but Eleanor felt creatively stunted. She needed something, anything, to spark her imagination.  She just wished it wouldn't involve braving the typhoon raging outside.
