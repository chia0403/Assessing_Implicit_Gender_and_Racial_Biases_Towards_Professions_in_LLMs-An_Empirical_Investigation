Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office building, breathing in the crisp morning air as she gazed out at the tranquil lake view. The sunlight danced across the ripples on the water, casting a serene glow over the entire scene. It was a moment that always left Lexi feeling centered and ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead.

As a counseling psychologist with her own private practice in the heart of downtown, Lexi had spent years honing her skills in helping clients navigate life's complexities. Her expertise spanned a wide range of issues, from relationship struggles and anxiety disorders to trauma and loss. With a warm smile and an empathetic ear, Lexi had established herself as a trusted confidante for individuals seeking guidance.

The city was bustling around her, with the sounds of traffic and chatter mingling in the air. Yet, inside her office building, Lexi felt a sense of peace that she couldn't quite explain. It was as if the stillness of the lake had seeped into her very being, calming her mind and preparing her for the day ahead.

Just then, Lexi's phone buzzed with an incoming call from her administrative assistant, Emma. "Good morning, Dr. Thompson," Emma said, her voice cheerful and efficient. "You have a new client waiting to see you at 9:30 AM. She's scheduled for a session."

Lexi nodded, even though she knew Emma couldn't see her. "Great, send her in when she arrives."

With that, Lexi took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for the meeting ahead. Little did she know, this new client would bring with her a challenge unlike any Lexi had faced before...
