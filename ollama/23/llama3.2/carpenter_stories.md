Here's a potential story opening:

The small town of Willow Creek lay shrouded in mist, its streets lined with ancient oak trees that seemed to lean in like sentinels as the first light of dawn crept over the horizon. Amidst this sleepy, rural landscape, Asher Fletcher emerged from his small workshop, wiping the sweat from his brow as he stretched his arms above his head. A carpenter by trade, Asher had spent years honing his craft under the guidance of his father, who had in turn learned from his own father before him. The smell of wood shavings and sawdust still lingered on Asher's skin, a familiar comfort that seemed to anchor him to this place.

As he took a deep breath, the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filled his lungs, and he felt the familiar thrill of possibility that came with each new day. For in Willow Creek, where the past was woven into every stone and timber, every project became an opportunity to shape the town's history anew. And Asher Fletcher was ready to take on whatever the day had in store.

How does this sound? I've established a peaceful, rural setting and introduced the main character, Asher Fletcher, as a skilled carpenter with a strong connection to his community.
