Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the sprawling estate of Willowdale Manor, casting a warm orange glow over the meticulously manicured lawns and gardens that groundskeeper Emilia Evelyn Windsor had spent her entire life tending to. As she made her way through the overgrown underbrush near the old stone fountain, the sound of gravel crunching beneath her boots was the only sound that broke the stillness of the evening air.

Emilia, a petite woman in her late twenties with long, curly brown hair and a smattering of freckles across her cheeks, stopped to examine a particularly stubborn patch of thistle that had somehow managed to grow through the cracks in the pavement. She pulled out a small knife from her apron pocket and began to carefully snip away at the noxious weed, her mind already turning to the long list of tasks she needed to complete before bedtime.

As the lights of Willowdale's grand estate flickered to life, casting a warm glow over the sprawling lawns and gardens, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had been working at Willowdale for five years, ever since her father's passing had left her with no choice but to take on the job to support herself, and she knew every inch of this estate like the back of her hand. But tonight felt different - tonight felt like something was waiting just out of sight, watching and waiting.

The wind picked up, carrying the distant rumble of thunder through the air, and Emilia's heart quickened with a sense of unease. She looked up at the darkening sky, her eyes squinting against the fading light. Suddenly, she felt like she was being pulled into something - something big - something that would change everything.

How is this? I tried to create an immersive atmosphere and introduce Emilia as a character with a personal connection to the estate.
