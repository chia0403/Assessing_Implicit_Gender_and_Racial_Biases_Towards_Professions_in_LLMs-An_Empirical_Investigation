Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as Camille Ad√®le LaFleur stepped out of her office building, into the chill of a winter evening. Her long, dark hair was pulled back in a tight ponytail, revealing the sharp lines of her face and the piercing green eyes that had earned her a reputation as one of the most formidable lawyers in the city's French Quarter.

As she gazed up at the historic buildings that seemed to lean in, whispering secrets to each other in the wind, Camille felt a familiar sense of restlessness. It was a feeling that had haunted her for years, ever since her last case had ended in defeat. The memory of that courtroom, with its unyielding judge and unforgiving jury, still lingered in her mind like a bad taste.

Camille took a deep breath, letting the cool air fill her lungs as she made her way down the steps to her waiting car. She was heading home to 1836 Rue St. Claude, where a mysterious package had been delivered earlier that day - wrapped in black paper and bearing no return address. The note inside had read simply: "The truth about your sister's death is hidden in plain sight."

With a sense of foreboding, Camille started the engine and pulled out into the crowded streets, her eyes scanning the darkening city for any sign of what was to come.
