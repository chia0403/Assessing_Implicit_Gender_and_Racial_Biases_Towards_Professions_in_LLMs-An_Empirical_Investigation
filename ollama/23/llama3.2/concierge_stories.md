Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans were always at their most melancholy during the night of the Spring Equinox. It was as if the city itself was exhaling a collective sigh, preparing for another year of sweltering summers and sultry nights. In this dimly lit world, where jazz music drifted through the French Quarter like a ghostly melody, 25-year-old concierge Étienne Baptiste watched the raindrops slide down the windows of his beloved Hotel Le Coeur de la Vie.

Étienne took pride in being the gatekeeper of sorts, responsible for ensuring that every guest who entered the hotel felt like royalty. He had worked at Le Coeur de la Vie for five years, and in that time, he had grown accustomed to its quirks and charms. From the ornate moldings to the antique chandeliers, every detail spoke of a bygone era when elegance was an art form.

As Étienne polished the brass doorknob with a soft cloth, his thoughts wandered to the mysterious letter he had received that morning. The envelope was plain white, with no return address and only two words: "Welcome home."
