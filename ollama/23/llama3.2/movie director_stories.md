Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Title: "The Cursed Reel"

Opening:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of Los Angeles, casting a golden glow over the iconic Hollywood sign, Adrian Julian Everett stood in front of his latest project, his eyes fixed on the grainy footage that would change his life forever. He had just received a mysterious package containing an old 35mm film reel with no indication of who sent it or what was on it. The only clue was a small note attached to the cassette: "Don't watch this one."

Adrian, a renowned movie director known for his dark and twisted storytelling, couldn't resist the temptation to uncover the secrets hidden within the mysterious reel. He carefully threaded the film through the projector's mechanism, feeling an eerie excitement build up inside him.

Setting:

The story takes place in 1985 Los Angeles, where the city is still reeling from the recent death of the film industry legend, Marty Kane. The once-great studio system has begun to crumble, and Adrian finds himself at the forefront of a new wave of independent filmmaking. His production company, Ravenwood Productions, has been struggling to stay afloat amidst the rising costs of producing high-quality content.

Adrian's office, located in a cramped studio on Sunset Boulevard, is cluttered with film equipment, script pages, and photographs of his favorite movie stars from the 1950s and '60s. The walls are adorned with vintage movie posters and faded Hollywood memorabilia. A large window overlooking the city allows natural light to flood in during the day, but at night, it's shrouded by a perpetual gloom that seems to seep into Adrian's very being.

As he prepared to watch the mysterious reel, Adrian couldn't shake off the feeling that his latest project was about to take on a life of its own â€“ one that would change him forever.
