Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Oxford were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these, when the grey sky seemed to press down upon the city like a physical force. Professor Emilia Elara Vasquez trudged through the puddles, her worn leather boots making soft squelching sounds in the flooded sidewalk.

At 55, Emilia had spent decades navigating the treacherous waters of academia, earning a reputation as one of the leading experts in her field of Byzantine studies. Her eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed to hold a world of wisdom within them, scanned the crowded pavement as she made her way back to her office.

As she walked, the dim glow of streetlamps cast long shadows behind her, like dark specters following closely in her wake. The wind rustled through the leaves of the ancient buildings, whispering secrets only known to the city's oldest inhabitants. It was a night that promised nothing but trouble, and Emilia could feel it in every fiber of her being.

And yet, as she pushed open the heavy wooden door to her office building, a sense of unease began to creep over her. For tonight, unlike any other night, Emilia had received an unexpected package â€“ one that would shake the foundations of everything she thought she knew about her research, and threaten to upend her entire life's work.

This is just a starting point, but I hope it gives you a sense of setting and character! Let me know if you'd like me to continue with the story.
