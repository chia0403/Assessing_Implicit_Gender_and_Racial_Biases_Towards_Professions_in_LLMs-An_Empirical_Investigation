Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set over the small town of Red Rock, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty main street. The smell of grease and gasoline hung in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers that dotted the outskirts of town.

 Inside his shop, "Mackenzie 'Mac' Thompson's Auto Repair," Mack himself was elbow-deep in a rusty old engine, his hands stained with engine oil and his hair mussed from hours of tinkering. The sound of revving engines and hushed conversations filled the air as Mac worked on his latest project, a 1969 Ford F-150 that he had restored to its former glory.

Mac was a man in his mid-30s, with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes that seemed to bore into those he met. His dark hair was cropped short, revealing a scattering of scars above his left eyebrow from a childhood accident. He wore a faded denim jacket over a grease-stained shirt, his hands moving with practiced ease as he worked on the engine.

Despite his rough exterior, Mac had a heart of gold and a deep love for cars that went back to his childhood. He had spent years working in his father's shop, learning the ins and outs of every make and model, before striking out on his own when his dad passed away. Now, at 35, Mac was the go-to mechanic for anyone in Red Rock who needed their car fixed or their engine tuned.

As he worked, Mack couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The phone had been ringing nonstop all day, and most of the calls were from anxious new owners asking about the status of their cars. But one call, in particular, had caught his attention - a mysterious woman who claimed to have found an old engine hidden away in her attic, and wanted Mac's expertise to restore it to its former glory.

Mack raised an eyebrow as he wiped the sweat from his forehead, intrigued by the prospect of taking on a new challenge. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take him down a rabbit hole of secrets, lies, and treacherous roads...
