Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Orleans glistened like polished onyx as insurance agent, Auguste "Gus" LaFleur stepped out of his office building and onto the pavement. The neon signs of Bourbon Street reflected off the wet surface, casting a gaudy glow over the crowded sidewalk. Gus pulled his fedora low over his eyes, shielding them from the relentless drizzle that seemed to seep into every pore.

As he lit a cigarette, Gus couldn't shake the feeling that today was going to be a long one.

The rain-soaked night air seemed to whisper secrets in his ear, and Gus felt a shiver run down his spine.
