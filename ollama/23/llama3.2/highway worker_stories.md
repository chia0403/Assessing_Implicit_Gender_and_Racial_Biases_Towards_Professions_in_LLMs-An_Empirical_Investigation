The sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, casting a pale orange glow over the desolate stretch of highway that stretched out before Jesse Wynter like an endless ribbon. As a maintenance worker for the state department of transportation, Jesse had spent countless mornings like this, trudging through the dewy grass and scrubby weeds that lined the shoulder, searching for potholes and cracks to repair.

It was a job he took pride in, despite the often-blighted conditions of the road itself.

He pushed it aside, telling himself it was just the usual pre-work jitters, but as he reached for his clipboard and began to scan the route ahead, the feeling only intensified.
