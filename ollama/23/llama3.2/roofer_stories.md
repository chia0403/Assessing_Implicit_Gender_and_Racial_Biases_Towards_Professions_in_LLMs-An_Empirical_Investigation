As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy town of Willow Creek, Arizona, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins climbed onto his worn-out truck, affectionately nicknamed "Bertha." Hawk rubbed the fatigue from his eyes, already dreading another long day of wrestling with the unforgiving desert sun and the sagging rooflines of Willow Creek's quaint homes. A seasoned roofer with over 20 years of experience, Hawk had seen it all – from the blistering heat that could shatter a man's spirit to the quiet beauty of a well-crafted shed.

Hawk took a deep breath, filling his lungs with the crisp morning air, and began to fire up Bertha. The rumble of the engine seemed to shake off some of the weight that had been building up in him since the death of his father, a fellow roofer who had taught Hawk everything he knew before passing away just a year ago. The loss still felt like an open wound, but Hawk refused to let it define him. He had a job to do, and Bertha was ready to take on whatever the day threw their way.

As he pulled out of the driveway, Hawk gazed out at the town's sleepy streets, lined with adobe homes that seemed to be weathered from years of desert storms. The sky above was a brilliant blue, with not a cloud in sight – an omen for another long and hot day ahead.
