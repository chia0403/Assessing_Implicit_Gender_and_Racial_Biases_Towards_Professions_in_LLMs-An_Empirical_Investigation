Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Elianore "Eli" Thompson stepped out of the rain-soaked streets of Seattle and into the warm, golden light of her office. The sound of gentle chatter and medical beeps filled the air as she made her way to the reception desk, shaking the water from her hair. It was a typical Wednesday morning at Harborview Medical Center, where Eli had spent the past five years working as an emergency medicine specialist.

As she changed out of her damp coat and hung it on the back of her door, Eli gazed out the window at the grey, mist-shrouded cityscape. The Olympic Mountains loomed in the distance, their peaks hidden behind a veil of cloud. It was a day like any other in Seattle – overcast, with a chance of scattered showers. But Eli wasn't one to let the weather dampen her spirits. She had more important things on her mind.

Her phone buzzed on the desk, breaking the silence. "Dr. Thompson?" A voice said, followed by the name and ID number of a patient waiting for her attention in room 304. Eli's eyes narrowed as she read the ID – it was one of her patients from last night's ER shift, a young woman named Sarah who had been brought in with severe injuries after being involved in a hit-and-run accident.

Something about this call seemed off. The voice on the other end sounded... nervous? "Can I help you?" Eli asked, her brow furrowed in concern.

But before she could get an answer, the phone went dead.
