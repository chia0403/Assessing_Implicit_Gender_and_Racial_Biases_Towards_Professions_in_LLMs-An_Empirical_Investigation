Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Ranch, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and scrubby desert landscape. It had been a long day for rancher, Ryder Elijah Blackwood, who had spent the better part of 12 hours herding cattle through the unforgiving terrain. The worn leather of his boots creaked with each step as he walked towards the old homestead, his calloused hands clutching a battered Stetson hat to keep out of the wind.

Ryder was a sixth-generation rancher, and the Blackwood family had owned and operated the Red Rock Ranch for over 150 years. The land was his birthright, passed down from his great-grandfather, who had settled in these parts with nothing but a handful of cattle and a dream. Ryder had grown up learning the ins and outs of the ranch, from branding irons to cattle vaccinations, and he took pride in carrying on the family tradition.

As he approached the homestead, Ryder could see that his wife, Emily, was already cooking dinner on the porch stove. The scent of sizzling meat and fresh herbs wafted out into the air, mingling with the sweet smell of mesquite trees and the distant tang of sagebrush. It was a familiar scent, one that brought Ryder comfort and peace after a long day's work.

But as he approached the house, Ryder noticed something strange - a piece of paper stuck in the doorframe, fluttering gently in the breeze. He picked it up, smoothing out the wrinkles, and his eyes widened as he read the message scrawled across its surface: "Meet me at the old windmill at midnight. Come alone."
