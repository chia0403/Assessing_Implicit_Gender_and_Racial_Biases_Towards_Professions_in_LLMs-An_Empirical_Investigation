Rain lashed against the glass doors of "The Zenith," leaving Agnes's normally pristine white apron damp. A symphony of coughs and sniffles echoed from within the sleek reception area.  Agnes ran her fingers over her worn collar as she watched the storm rage outside, each gust of wind a tiny fist pounding on the windowpane. She was Evelyn Thorne, the receptionist at The Zenith - or "The Zen" to those who understood the secret code behind its doors. 

Inside, the air hummed with an electric tension that Agnes found both exhilarating and exhausting.  It was always like this during the week; a whirl of polished heels, whispered conversations about fortunes amassed and hidden secrets, and the weight of expectations hanging heavy in the opulent atmosphere. The Zenith wasn't just any building - it housed the most powerful minds in New York City, their ambitions as sharp as the edges of its bespoke furnishings. 

Tonight was different though. Tonight, something had shifted. A shadow lingered at the entrance, a man shrouded in an oversized coat despite the roaring inferno of the fireplace.  Agnes felt a sudden prickle on her skin - an unease that she knew wasn't entirely about the storm outside.  Her gaze flickered to the door again, curiosity warring with caution. The man was watching her, and his presence made Agnes feel as if she were being observed by a hawk, every breath measured, every movement scrutinized.
