The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the playground, turning the bright swings into skeletal silhouettes against the faded red slide.  Inside the school clinic, Dr. Elara Thorne's office felt as stifling as a forgotten history book. The scent of lavender and old paper was thick in the air, clinging to her tweed jacket like a phantom limb. She sighed, pushing back stray strands of auburn hair that had escaped its loose bun. The last few weeks had been...unorthodox, to say the least. 

It started with Mrs. Henderson's son, Daniel, who hadn't quite grasped the concept of sharing his crayons.  Now, the whole school was abuzz with whispered anxieties and parental demands, fueled by a rumour that an "invisible monster" lurked in the shadows of the library, stealing homework and leaving behind the faint scent of stale chocolate. 

Elara, however, knew better. The problem wasn't a monstrous beast, but a growing chasm between two minds â€“ her own and Mrs. Henderson's. A chasm that felt as vast as the empty playground in her mind.  The setting sun cast long shadows on the schoolyard, stretching her focus like an unraveled thread.
