The flickering neon sign of "McAllister & Sons Plumbing" buzzed erratically above Daniel McAllister's head as he surveyed the scene before him. A sprawling Victorian home with gingerbread trim and ivy creeping around the eaves stood in stark contrast to the gritty reality of the rain lashing down on its roof, making the windows look like they were weeping. Inside, the once-regal parlor now looked like a hurricane had swept through, furniture overturned, plaster chipped, and a faint smell of decay clinging to the air. 

Daniel McAllister, his name as sturdy and reliable as his worn leather boots, took a deep breath, pulling off his battered baseball cap. This was just another Wednesday, or maybe he'd been cursed by some bad plumbing luck. He'd be here for at least an hour - the kind of call that left him with more than just grime on his overalls. It always was like this: one messy leak and then another, a cycle repeating itself in this old town full of secrets and history.  
 
Tonight, though, it felt different. There was a heaviness in the air, something beyond a normal storm's damp chill. The pressure building as he entered deeper into the house was tangible. The silence held more than just the usual sounds of dripping pipes; there was an undercurrent of unease that sent shivers down his spine.
