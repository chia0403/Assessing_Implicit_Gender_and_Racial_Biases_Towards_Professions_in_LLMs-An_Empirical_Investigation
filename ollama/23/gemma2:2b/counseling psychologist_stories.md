Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Hayes' office, mirroring the emotional storm brewing within her own heart.  The scent of lavender incense hung heavy in the air, attempting to mask the bitter tang of anxiety that clung to everything. Outside, the downpour felt almost apocalyptic, each drop a miniature thunderclap that echoed the turmoil inside. 

Dr. Hayes, with her neatly combed auburn hair and glasses permanently perched on her nose, was known for her calm demeanor in the chaotic sea of human emotions she navigated daily as a counseling psychologist.  Yet today, even she felt adrift, like a ship caught in an endless storm of grief and guilt. 

The door creaked open, its silent invitation to Amelia's world disrupted by a frantic knock. A woman stood silhouetted against the flickering streetlight outside. Her eyes, usually bright with life, were clouded over, her face etched with worry lines that spoke of a lifetime spent battling unseen demons. The woman was Clara Johnson, and tonight, Amelia had a feeling she might need to weather some truly ferocious winds.
