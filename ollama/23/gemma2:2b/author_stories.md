Rain lashed against the dusty attic window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Evelyn Thorne's heart as she sifted through boxes overflowing with her grandmother's belongings. Dust motes danced in the weak sunlight streaming through the grimy pane, illuminating faded floral patterns on worn fabric and chipped porcelain figurines. Each object held the ghost of a memory, each echo whispered tales of a life long past.

The weight of history pressed down on Evelyn's shoulders as she ran her fingers across a faded journal tucked away in the bottom of a trunk. Its cover was adorned with a delicate rose motif and beneath it, she found her grandmother's handwriting - messy yet elegant: **"The truth may lie hidden behind locked doors, but sometimes even silence screams."**
