A life teetering precariously on the edge of both hope and despair -  a boy whose dreams were as tattered as his worn-out jacket, who clung onto them with an unwavering tenacity that was breathtaking in its raw honesty.

Danny's probation had been a tumultuous journey so far, filled with missed appointments, stolen moments of joy, and the lingering threat of another slip into the abyss of despair that seemed to engulf him. But tonight felt different. The air held a tension so thick it could be cut with a knife.  A storm was brewing not just outside the window, but within Danny's own heart, threatening to unleash something catastrophic and unforgiving.
