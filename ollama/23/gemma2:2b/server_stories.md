## The Silver Spoon & the Storm 

Rain lashed against the windows of "The Silver Spoon," its mournful rhythm echoing Amelia Croft's own frayed nerves. Her apron clung to her damp form like a second skin, the aroma of freshly-baked bread battling with the sharp tang of salt and pepper that always seemed to cling to this old seaside restaurant. It was December in Port Haven, and winter had gripped the town with a bone-deep chill. 

Amelia, "Amy" as everyone called her, ran a practiced hand over the worn mahogany table where two elderly gentlemen sat, their silence punctuated only by the distant crackle of the fire in the hearth. She'd known them for years - they were regulars. Mr. Jenkins, the retired sailor with eyes like polished sea glass, and Mrs. O'Malley, her ever-so-slightly mischievous grin hinting at a past as colorful as the threads on her floral apron. The weight of their unspoken stories, heavy as lead anchors in her mind, was more familiar to her than breathing. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. A low groan echoed from the storm outside and Amelia could feel it through the floorboards. It wasn't just the rain; it was a feeling that crawled up her spine like a spider's web, prickling with an unfamiliar sense of dread. The storm hadn't started until late this afternoon but now it seemed as if it had been brewing all day. 


This is where Amelia finds herself: 

* A bustling seaside restaurant in the heart of a stormy December
* Facing two silent customers who seem to hold secrets about her past and present life
* An unsettling feeling that something is wrong, something more than just a storm outside



**What happens next?**  We could continue with:

* The arrival of a new customer who brings a sense of urgency. 
* A flashback scene revealing an important part of Amelia's past.
* Amelia finding a hidden message within one of the old patronsâ€™ belongings.
