The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and stale coffee in the cramped drafting room at the bottom of Old Glory Industries.  Dust motes danced under the harsh fluorescents, illuminating the cluttered desks where blueprints littered every surface like fallen soldiers from a forgotten war. 

At one such desk sat **Evelyn "Evie" Carter**, her forehead furrowed as she painstakingly recreated a complex network of pipes and valves on a sprawling sheet of graph paper.  Evie was a draftsman through and through, her calloused fingers moving with an almost silent grace that belied the sheer physical labor required for her trade. She had spent years honing her craft in this very room, her mind mapping out intricate solutions to the impossible, her pencil tracing out the blueprints of life’s infrastructure – a life she felt inextricably bound to, even as it seemed to constantly slip through her fingers.

Today's project was particularly daunting:  The design for a new water treatment plant in the heart of the city. A monumental task that demanded precision and patience. The pressure was tangible, like a weight on Evie’s chest, each tick of the clock a drumbeat in the symphony of stress that resonated throughout the room. Even as she felt the familiar fatigue settle in, her eyes remained glued to the graph paper, tracing an unseen path for a future yet unwritten.

It was then that a tremor ran through the building, followed by a deafening crack.  A shudder rippled through the room, sending Evie's pencil flying across the desk like a startled sparrow. The flickering fluorescent light sputtered and died, plunging the room into darkness. For a moment, all was silent but for the frantic beating of Evie’s heart.
