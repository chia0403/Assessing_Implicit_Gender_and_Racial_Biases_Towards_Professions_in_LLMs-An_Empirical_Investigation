Rain pattered against the windows of "Tax Relief Solutions", a rhythm that had become as much a part of Amelia's daily routine as her own heartbeat. Her small office, crammed with filing cabinets and overflowing stacks of forms, offered little escape from the relentless downpour outside. Amelia adjusted her glasses, squinting at the complex financial statements spread across her desk like a miniature battlefield.

This was no ordinary season; there were whispers of a major economic shift looming, and even the stoic IRS regulations seemed to be playing coy, hiding their true intentions behind cryptic language. Amelia needed answers – but for now, she had to start with these individual puzzles, one tax bracket at a time.
