The scent of rosemary and thyme hung thick in the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of warm dough rising in the ovens.  It was always like this at The Hearth & Honey, Amelia's bakery nestled amongst the cobbled streets of Alderton, a town where time seemed to flow at its own measured pace. The afternoon sun spilled through the arched windowpanes, casting long shadows across the wooden tables and flour-dusted counter. 

Amelia, her silver hair tied back in a tidy bun, was lost in the rhythm of her work. Each day, she kneaded, whipped, rolled, and baked with a practised ease born from years spent crafting her signature breads.  Her heart throbbed in time with the gentle clanging of pots and pans. This was her sanctuary, this bakery her legacy. 

However, today, a creeping unease settled over Amelia's normally peaceful world. A storm had rolled in faster than expected, the sky darkening into an ominous grey. The howling wind whistled through the eaves, and even the usually bustling street outside felt eerily deserted.  A chill, unlike the usual winter breeze, lingered in the air.
