The first frost had etched its icy fingers across the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor.  A cruel chill settled in Elias Thorne's bones as he surveyed the wilted roses that stood defiant against the encroaching cold. The rose bushes had been his pride and joy for years, but even they seemed to wilt under this bitter winter.  He ran a hand through his thick, grey hair, muttering a silent prayer to Old Man Winter for a sudden thaw. Blackwood Manor was a sprawling old estate nestled in the heart of Vermont's rolling hills, its grandeur fading with each passing decade. Elias wasn't just a groundskeeper; he was the last link to its forgotten beauty.

The manor itself stood like a silent sentinel, shrouded in mist that clung to its gothic architecture like a phantom. It had once hummed with life – now, only dust motes danced in the shafts of grey sunlight slanting through the windowpanes. Elias sighed as he walked past the crumbling fountain, the water still running from it despite years of neglect. He was no stranger to melancholy; it clung to Blackwood Manor like a stubborn vine. But tonight, something felt different – an unsettling sense of presence lingered in the crisp air.
