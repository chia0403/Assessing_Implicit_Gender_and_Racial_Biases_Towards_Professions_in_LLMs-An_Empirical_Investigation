The scent of old paper and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of Ms. Eleanor Sterling's office.  Eleanor herself was a stark picture against the chipped paint and faded floral wallpaper; her crisp, white blouse and tailored black skirt were the only touches of color in the otherwise subdued room. Her usually bright eyes seemed dulled under the weight of weeks of unpaid bills, mounting work deadlines, and a persistent feeling that something wasn't quite right about her life.  This was New Salem - once a vibrant hub for artists and dreamers, now a quiet town clinging to its fading legacy. 

Eleanor ran her fingers over the worn leather spine of a book on early American cartography. It was a relic from her grandfather's days before he had "retired" to a life filled with sunshine and his beloved citrus orchard in California, leaving Eleanor to navigate the dusty labyrinth that was their family business.  Her father, however, still managed the old manor house, its grandeur slowly crumbling under years of neglect - a reminder of how far she herself seemed from achieving her dreams of opening a successful art gallery. 

"Ms. Sterling?" A voice called out from the open doorway. Her assistant, a young man named Daniel with perpetually worried eyes and an equally worried smile, stood hesitantly in the doorway. "Mr. Hayes is requesting your presence."
