## Setting: The Rusty Cog

The air in "The Rusty Cog" was thick with the scent of stale beer, burnt coffee, and regret. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee against the creaky windows of the old tavern, rattling the glass bottles lining the shelves. Inside, flickering gaslights cast long, dancing shadows across the chipped wooden tables, turning the usual dimness into an almost tangible sense of loneliness. 

This was where Elias Thorne spent his days, pouring whiskey and tending to a clientele that seemed as worn down as the bar itself. He ran the place with calloused hands and a weary heart, years etched onto his face like lines on a map he'd long lost sight of. 


## Main Character: Elias Thorne

Elias was more than just a bartender; he was the keeper of secrets, a witness to countless tales both mundane and magnificent. His eyes, deep-set and tinged with gold flecks, held the weight of untold stories, each line whispering of lives lived and lost. Tonight, however, his usual quiet contemplation was interrupted by the entrance of a woman unlike any he'd seen before - her fiery red hair spilling over a white blouse like a wave.
