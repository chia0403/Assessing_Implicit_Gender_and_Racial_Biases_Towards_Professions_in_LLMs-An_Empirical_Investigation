## Setting: A dusty corner barbershop in 1940s San Francisco

**Story Opening:**

Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of "The Razor's Edge," its steady rhythm punctuated only by the occasional cough from inside. The scent of sandalwood and old-world cologne hung heavy, a perfume almost as faded as the worn velvet curtain that separated the barber chair from the rest of the shop. 

Elroy Thorne, his face weathered like an ancient oak, wiped down a stray tear on the worn mahogany bar in his shop. He wasn't sure if it was the storm outside or the weight of another day in San Francisco, but he felt a hollowness settle deeper than usual. His usual clientele -  a colorful tapestry woven from sailors, artists, and the occasional mobster - hadn’t come through today. Just the steady hum of the rain and his own restless thoughts echoed around him. 

His tools, polished to a sheen, lay on the floor, waiting for them to be used: the razor, as sharp as ever; the clippers, their edges gleaming under the dim shop light; and the bowl of steaming water that awaited its next customer.
