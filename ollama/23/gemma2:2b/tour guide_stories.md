The late afternoon sun painted the cobbled streets of Prague golden as Elara "Ellie" Petrov guided her tour group through Old Town Square. Her chestnut hair, usually pulled back in a tight bun, was escaping its confines thanks to the brisk wind, bouncing with each step as she spoke. 

"And there," Ellie declared, gesturing towards the towering Petřín Tower, "the city's beating heart!" The tower’s silhouette cast long shadows across the square, its iconic clock face a beacon against the darkening sky.  "For centuries, this has been the epicentre of life in Prague! A place where merchants haggled for spices, artists painted masterpieces, and even rebellious souls dared to stage their revolution." 

Ellie knew the stories well. Stories whispered through centuries of history; legends intertwined with the very stones beneath their feet. But as she watched the tourists capture each detail of her narration on their phones, a sense of longing tugged at Ellie’s heart.  For all this history, the city was losing its soul - replaced by selfie sticks and tourist traps. 


**Setting:** Prague, Czech Republic. The story is set in the charming old town square with its vibrant historical sights, bustling with tourists. 

**Main character:** Ellie Petrov (Ellie for short), a tour guide who has witnessed the magic of Prague fade away under the weight of modern tourism.
