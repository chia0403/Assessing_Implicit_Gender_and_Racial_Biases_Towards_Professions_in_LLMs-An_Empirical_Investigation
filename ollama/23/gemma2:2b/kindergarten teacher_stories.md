Rain hammered against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Willow’s classroom like tiny fists pummeling a giant's stomach.  The scent of wet cardboard hung heavy in the air, a ghostly reminder of the storm that raged outside and how quickly it could transform the cheerful playground into a muddy quagmire. Inside, however, was a different scene entirely. 

Mrs. Willow, her auburn braids bouncing with each step as she walked through the room, surveyed her students. There were five little bundles of energy – the shy little Lily, the boisterous Finn, the studious Emily, and twins Michael and Sophia whose mischievous grins never failed to brighten even the cloudiest day. Even in the midst of a downpour, Mrs. Willow had managed to transform her classroom into a haven of sunshine.  

"Alright my little explorers," she announced with a bright smile, her blue eyes sparkling above thick glasses that perched precariously on her nose. “It's time for our rainforest adventure!”
