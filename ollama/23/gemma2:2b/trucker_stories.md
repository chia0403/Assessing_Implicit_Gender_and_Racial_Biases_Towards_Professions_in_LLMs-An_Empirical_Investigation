The rumble of the eighteen-wheeler vibrated through Caleb's teeth as he navigated the winding mountain road.  His worn leather jacket felt heavier than usual against his damp skin as a persistent drizzle painted the Nevada foothills in shades of grey.  He squinted at the gauges, their red numbers flashing like angry eyes in the dim cab lights. 80 hours on the road, and miles to go before he slept, but Caleb had built a lifetime habit of pushing through. He was known by his nickname – “Old Crow” – in the trucker circles; a quiet soul with hands that could coax a busted engine back to life, even though his gruff exterior hid a heart full of wanderlust.

This time, however, the destination wasn’t just another delivery. It was a pilgrimage. Caleb was heading to the ghost town of Dust Devil Junction –  a place whispered about in hushed tones amongst fellow truckers; a town where the wind carried more secrets than its crumbling buildings could hold.
