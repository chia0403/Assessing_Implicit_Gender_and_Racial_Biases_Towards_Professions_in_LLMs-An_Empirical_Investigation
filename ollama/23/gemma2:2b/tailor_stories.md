The air hung heavy with the scent of wool and lavender as Elara's needle danced across the velvet fabric. Dust motes swirled in the sliver of moonlight that cut through the grimy window of her small shop, illuminating the intricate patterns she was crafting for Lady Genevieve’s upcoming ball. For Elara, a tailor known to many only by her initials “E.R”, this wasn't just another commission; it was an expression of artistry, a testament to her talent.  

For years, Elara had poured her heart into stitching intricate gowns and suits, transforming raw materials into something beautiful and functional. The cobbled streets of Oldtown hummed with life, yet the solitude of her shop offered her peace. Here, amidst the scent of lavender and the rhythmic tap-tap of needles, she felt most at home. But tonight, a creeping unease settled on Elara's soul as she looked out onto the moonlit streets – a feeling that something was amiss, even in this usually peaceful haven. 

**Setting:** A tiny shop tucked away in a quiet corner of Oldtown. The walls are lined with shelves laden with bolts of fabric, tools, and mannequins dressed in various outfits. Outside, the world is bustling with life but within, it's a sanctuary of solitude and creativity for Elara.


**Main Character:**  Elara Raines (E.R.)
