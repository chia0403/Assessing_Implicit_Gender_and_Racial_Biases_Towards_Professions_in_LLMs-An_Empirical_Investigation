The aroma of smoke and iron hung heavy in the air as Silas "Grim" Grimwood surveyed his domain - the sprawling meat market of Little Haven. The sun dipped towards the horizon, staining the sky with bruised oranges and deep purples, turning the bustling marketplace into an ethereal tapestry of shadows and light.  His shop, nestled amongst the chaos of vendors hawking their wares and families haggling over prices, was a sanctuary in this storm of commerce. Inside, stacks of beef roasts stood proud, while neatly arranged racks held rows upon rows of sausages, cured meats, and pickled goods.

Grimwood, his hands calloused from years of handling meat, was the master of his trade, known for his meticulous cuts and ability to age meat with an almost magical touch. He'd inherited the shop from his grandfather, a stern but loving man who had instilled in him a respect for the beasts he worked with, and a deep-seated understanding of human hunger.  But tonight was different. Tonight, Grimwood was wrestling not just with the weight of the meat but also with a knot of anxiety in his stomach. For tonight, he would be making one final decision â€“ one that would forever change him, his family, and the very fabric of Little Haven.
