Rain lashed against the grimy window of my office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign outside. The rhythmic drumming echoed the thrumming in my ears, a discordant symphony of desperation and expectation.  My fingers danced across the worn leather of my briefcase, tracing the embossed initials that I had sworn never to let anyone else touch. It was a foolish vow, really, for these hands were as battered and marked as any honest detective's. 

The name on the file before me was hardly surprising: "Miss Amelia Thorne," her portrait staring back from an aged newspaper. Her eyes, wide and haunted, held an age far beyond her twenty years. I adjusted my fedora, a thin veil hiding the weariness etched onto my face, and took a long drag of my cigarette. 

Amelia's case wasn't your average missing person scenario. It was a tale woven with threads of ancient magic and hidden agendas, all tied to a legendary artifact called The Crimson Orb - said to hold immense power within its ruby heart.  And that, as I suspected with every fiber of my being, was what landed me here in this godforsaken alleyway of forgotten dreams and broken promises, staring down the abyss with Amelia's fading hope.
