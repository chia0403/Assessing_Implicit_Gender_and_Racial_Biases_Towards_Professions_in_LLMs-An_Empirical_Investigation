The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. It clung to Theodore "Teddy" Hawthorne like a second skin, clinging tighter as he walked down the long corridor of The Grand Regency. His starched collar felt constricting, his polished shoes slapping against the worn-out linoleum floor with every step.  The echo bounced back off the towering mahogany doors and ornate iron railings, emphasizing the emptiness of the hotel. It was a stark contrast to the bustling energy Teddy, just a few years out of the orphanage's doorstep, had come to find in his dreams - dreams that felt so far away now as he shuffled between empty hallways and deserted rooms.  The Grand Regency was a monument to faded grandeur, its ornate facade barely concealing the creeping decay beneath. 

Teddy sighed, adjusting his bowtie with trembling fingers. He hadn't been able to shake the feeling of being trapped within these walls for weeks now - weeks that felt like years since heâ€™d left the orphanage.  It was supposed to be a chance, an opportunity at a fresh start, yet every morning began with the same monotonous routine: cleaning, organizing, and serving - all while pretending his eyes weren't glued to those who walked past him in fancy clothes and whose pockets held far more than his ever could.
