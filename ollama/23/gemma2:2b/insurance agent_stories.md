Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane of Ethan Thorne's office, each drop a tiny hammer on the flimsy glass shield that separated him from the storm raging outside. A faint whirring sound filled the room, punctuated by the insistent ticking of his grandfather clock - an old relic from Ethan's own grandmother's time, now more testament to the passing years than to anything else. Ethan himself looked out of place, a young man surrounded by age-worn suits and the scent of cedar and old paper. He was the youngest insurance agent in Elmhurst, a town where time seemed to move at a slower pace, yet his world felt as though it had been thrown into overdrive. 

His fingers hovered over the worn phone on his desk, the weight of the call already heavy in his chest. It was Mrs. Delacroix, her voice always crackling with an almost feral energy - the kind that made his stomach churn just by hearing it. He knew she hadn't called about insurance, not really. Not this time. The rain was mirroring a tear on Ethan's cheek as he finally lifted the phone to his ear. 

**Setting:** Elmhurst, Illinois, a quaint but aging town with a rich history and an equally rich collection of secrets.  The setting is meant to be reminiscent of small-town America where everyone knows everyone else's business and whispers echo down every street corner.


**Main Character:** Ethan Thorne, a young insurance agent who feels like he doesn't quite belong in his time or place. He is haunted by the ghosts of past cases and weighed down by the weight of responsibility.
