The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and old polish in "Eléonore's Elegant Nails," a tiny shop tucked away in a bustling corner of Chinatown. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Nguyen, her face illuminated by the soft glow of a hundred lamp lights, was lost in the meticulous task of shaping nails. Her hands moved like delicate dancers, painting each nail with an artistry that bordered on the surreal – long, ivory tips tipped with iridescent glitter, short almond shapes adorned with delicate swirls of ruby red gel polish.

Tonight was particularly busy; wedding season had sprung upon the city like a mischievous, manic wind, and Amy was at the heart of it all. The chatter of customers, hushed phone calls, and the gentle murmur of gossip were punctuated by the rhythmic clicks of nail files, each stroke as precise and deliberate as an ancient melody. 

Amy’s mind was elsewhere though, racing ahead in a blur of anticipation. Tonight wasn't just another manicurist gig; it was the night she would finally face her biggest fear – the one that had haunted her since childhood: performing her own wedding ceremony.  Her grandmother, Elora, had passed away last month and left behind a legacy – not of wealth or status, but of love. A love so profound that she'd woven it into every thread of Amy’s life, and now, in her grief, the weight of fulfilling that legacy pressed down on Amy like a tangible burden.
