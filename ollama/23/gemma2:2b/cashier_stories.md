The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara's head, their pale glow reflecting off the endless rows of cereal boxes in the grocery store aisle. It was the third shift, and her tired eyes felt like they were battling against a permanent fog. Each box seemed to blur into the next; a symphony of cardboard and plastic, all bearing the same cheerful logos: Tony's Toffee Crunch, Sunny Mornings, Captain's Choice.  Elara, who usually prided herself on her meticulous stacking technique, found herself struggling to maintain any semblance of order in the face of the relentless tide of goods flowing in from the back room.

Her name was Elara Vance, and she was a cashier at "Sunshine Market," a local staple that felt more like a museum relic than an efficient grocery store.  The air hung thick with the smell of stale bread and overripe bananas; a testament to both its age and the low turnover rate of customers. Even though this was her workplace for five years, she still found it hard to believe they hadn’t replaced those antiquated cash registers yet - how much could a simple transaction take so long?  She sighed, leaning back against the wall as she waited for the next customer to wander through the checkout line and into the clutches of her weary soul.  
 
Her day had begun with an encounter so bizarre that even the old woman across the street selling donuts wouldn’t dare to dream it up. A talking crow, perched on a nearby lamppost, had regaled her with riddles and cryptic pronouncements in exchange for a bag of stale chocolate chips she'd offered as a bribe.  It was just another Tuesday in Elara's life; a world that seemed more fantastical than reality, even if it didn't make much sense.
