The Wyoming wind whipped around Jebediah “Jeb” Cole's weathered face, stinging his eyes with the dry dust that swirled from the parched earth. The sun hung low in the vast, ochre sky, casting long shadows across the sprawling ranch he’d inherited from his father.  It was a world of endless blue skies and unforgiving terrain, where cattle grazed eternally on the sparse patches of green grass, and the only sounds were the mournful bleating of the herds and the rustling of wind in the sagebrush. 

Jeb stood at the edge of the barn, its wooden planks creaking under his weight as he surveyed the land that had been his legacy for his entire life. But lately, even the old ranch felt like it was trying to break him. Drought had choked their pastures dry, the cattle grew thin and weak, and the whispers of a failing economy echoed in the wind. Jeb’s grandfather had warned him about relying on the unpredictable rhythms of nature; this land was too unforgiving, he'd said.  But Jeb clung to hope, hoping for a rain that might bring back the life he knew. 

His calloused hands gripped his worn leather chaps, and he took a deep breath, the scent of hay filling his lungs. He looked out at the horizon - the sun was setting, painting the sky in shades of crimson and orange, and as Jeb closed his eyes to take another deep breath of this familiar world, the silence felt more oppressive than ever before.
