The hangar's air hung thick with the smell of jet fuel and ozone.  A symphony of clanks and whirring filled the vast space as maintenance crews tinkered around the sleek, obsidian hull of Captain Aurora "Stormrider" Hawthorne's ship, the *Nightwind*.

Aurora felt both pride and trepidation as she stared at the distant city lights, each one pulsating with the dreams of a future yet to be written. Her mission: To deliver a vital shipment of medical supplies to the isolated outpost on Olympus Mons, the planet's highest peak.  But a low rumble echoed through the ship, like a beast waking from its slumber. The *Nightwind* vibrated with anticipation, and Aurora felt her heart quicken - the storm was coming.
