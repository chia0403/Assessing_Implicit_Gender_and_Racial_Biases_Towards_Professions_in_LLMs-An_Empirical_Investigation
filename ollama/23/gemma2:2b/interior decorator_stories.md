The mahogany door swung open with a sigh, revealing an air thick with dust motes dancing in the beam of Amelia's bare bulb. A chill clung to her, more than just the late October air creeping through the old house.  Amelia ran a hand over her worn coat, its collar pulled high as she stepped further into the space. "Just like this," she murmured, gazing at the cavernous room - an expansive living area in a Victorian mansion that had seen better days. 

The room's once-glorious grandeur was now obscured by layers of peeling paint, faded tapestries, and a lingering sense of neglect. The only furniture remaining was a massive, ornate desk with chipped marble inlay, its surface seemingly holding onto secrets from another era.  Amelia straightened her posture, her name badge, "Amelia Thorne," pinned to the breast pocket of her worn tweed jacket.  "Well, let's bring some life back into this place." Her brow furrowed as she scanned the room.
