Rain lashed against the single window in his cramped workshop, blurring the streetlights into flickering ghosts. The air hung heavy with the smell of ozone and pine-sol, remnants of countless electrical mishaps fixed by Caleb "Sparks" Thorne over the years. 27 years young, Sparks had a face etched with hard lines and an almost permanent frown – testament to his love for the intricate dance of wires and circuitry that held his world in its grip.

Tonight, though, even his usual quiet solitude was disturbed. The flickering neon sign outside, advertising "Cosmic Conections," cast a lurid green glow onto the worn floorboards as if mocking him. It wasn't just any repair tonight; it was the kind of job that made Sparks' knuckles ache with both frustration and a strange thrill. A woman lay sprawled against the back door of the shop, her face bruised and lips twisted in pain. She had called for help, but her cries were lost in the storm.

"What is this about, Miss?" Sparks muttered, his calloused fingers already tracing the frayed wires around a flickering power meter. The woman's eyes, filled with fear and something else he couldn’t quite name, met his gaze. "I need to know."
