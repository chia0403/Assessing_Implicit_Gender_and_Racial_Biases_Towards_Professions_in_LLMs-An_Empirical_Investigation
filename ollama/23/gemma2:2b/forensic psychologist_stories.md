The crisp October air stung Dr. Alistair Thorne's cheeks as he stood at the edge of the sprawling cemetery.  A lone Jack-o'-lantern sat on a weathered tombstone, casting an eerie glow across the sea of headstones. It was his usual spot – a quiet ritual he performed every Wednesday evening before starting his weekly consultations at the state-run mental health facility.  The setting sun painted the sky in hues of dying embers and bruised plum as Alistair gazed at the faces of those who had crossed over, some etched with sorrow, others shrouded in an unnerving calm. 

Alistair wasn't one for the macabre. His life revolved around understanding the human mind – its intricate tapestry of emotions, motivations, and fears. He saw his work not as a gruesome dissection but as a delicate dance with the soul, a quest to comprehend the essence of what it meant to be human.  Tonight, though, a new case had thrown a wrench into his normally ordered routine.  The body found at the city's edge, entangled in an abandoned warehouse, was far from ordinary. 

His eyes settled on a face etched with terror – a young woman's, barely out of her teens. The chilling tableau of the crime scene, still raw and unfiltered by time, lay starkly before him.  It demanded his attention, demanding answers he desperately sought, answers that would unveil the secrets hidden beneath this facade of cold stone. 


His thoughts turned to the woman's case file – a young woman named Eleanor Carter whose life had been tragically cut short under unsettling circumstances. The city was abuzz with speculation: an unsolved homicide or perhaps even ritualistic murder?  Alistair, known for his unconventional methods and unwavering dedication, was called upon to unravel this perplexing enigma. 

His appointment at the facility awaited him, a daunting task that promised an exploration of the darkest recesses of human behaviour – but first, he needed answers in the graveyard's quiet embrace.
