The humid air hung thick in the cabin like an invisible fog as Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, Flight 723 to Sydney, walked through the aisle.  She was already well-acquainted with the rhythm of this routine - the gentle sigh of the plane settling into its altitude, the murmuring passengers transitioning from sleepy and stressed to excited and ready for takeoff. She smiled at a young couple huddled in the window seat, their fingers intertwined, as she passed by with the daily dose of snacks and pre-flight instructions.  But tonight was different. The usual calming blue of the sky outside had morphed into a stormy gray canvas. Wind howled around the plane like a tormented spirit, echoing Amelia's own unease. 

**Setting:** A Boeing 747 flying from Chicago to Sydney.  
**Main Character:** Amy Cartwright - Flight Attendant, known for her calm demeanor and quiet kindness but now battling something far bigger than turbulence.
