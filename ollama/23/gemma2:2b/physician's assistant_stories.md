Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evans’ office in Chicago’s gritty Andersonville neighborhood. The storm had been going on for days, turning familiar city streets into an unruly symphony of rushing water and howling wind. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Lawson, Physician Assistant to Dr. William Hayes, surveyed her patient's file with a sigh.  It was 1:30 am, the usual hours when the city’s noise seemed to rise a notch in anticipation for the dawn. The file depicted a 42-year-old construction worker, Mr. Miller, who'd been brought in for persistent chest pain and shortness of breath. He had been working on a massive steel beam expansion project at the nearby Chicago Skybridge development when he suddenly collapsed. Now, his life hung precariously between oxygen tanks and the uncertain hope of survival. 

Amy’s mind was buzzing with a kaleidoscope of possible diagnoses: a blood clot, an aneurism, even a rare form of muscular dystrophy. The weight of those possibilities pressed down on her like an unseen shroud. Her phone buzzed – Dr. Hayes was sending his usual pre-surgery rundown via text, but the anxiety gnawed at Amy’s chest. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil within. 


**Setting:**  Andersonville neighborhood in Chicago - a working class community marked by poverty and its accompanying struggles, with a sense of resilience simmering beneath the surface. Dr. Hayes' office is modest yet cozy, filled with books on ancient medicine, a worn antique desk, and framed photographs of his family. It's both comforting and slightly out of place in this neighborhood's grit.
