Outside, the relentless Chicago winter raged, but within the confines of "Blackwood Tax Services," spring seemed to exist only in Elara's daydreams – dreams of sunshine, blooming cherry trees, and escaping the endless labyrinth of deductions and tax credits. 

Today was particularly brutal. A mountain of client folders loomed like a dormant volcano, threatening to erupt with stress any minute. Each one held the hopes, anxieties, and often baffling financial situations of Elara's clientele. She sighed, massaging her temples, before reaching for the first file – Mrs. Mildred Peterson’s tax return.
