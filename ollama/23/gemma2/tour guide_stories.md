The sun beat down on Amelia Evangeline Thistlewick's crisp white collar as she adjusted her straw boater hat.  Dust motes danced in the shaft of sunlight that pierced through the gaps in the ancient stone walls of Pompeii. Around her, twenty pairs of eyes, wide with anticipation and heat-glazed boredom, stared at her expectantly. 

Amelia sighed internally. Another day, another gaggle of tourists eager to be spoon-fed history. She adjusted the strap of her leather satchel, the one overflowing with meticulously researched facts and anecdotes she hoped would ignite a spark of genuine interest in her audience.  

The air hung heavy with the scent of baking bread from the nearby bakery and the faint, metallic tang of volcanic ash still lingering in the ruins after all these centuries. Amelia took a deep breath, plastering on her most enthusiastic smile.

"Welcome, everyone, to Pompeii!" she boomed, her voice echoing through the desolate yet strangely vibrant streets. "Today, we embark on a journey back in time..." 


Amelia's gaze swept across the expectant faces, hoping against hope that at least one soul would be captivated by the whispers of the past.  For Amelia, guiding these tours wasn't just a job; it was an opportunity to breathe life into history, to connect with the people who walked these very streets millennia ago.
