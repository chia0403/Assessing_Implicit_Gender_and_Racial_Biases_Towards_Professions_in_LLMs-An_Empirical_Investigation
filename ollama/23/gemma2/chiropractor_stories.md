Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes' office, mimicking the relentless throbbing in her own head. The Seattle air was thick with the scent of petrichor and impending storm, a familiar cocktail that usually calmed her. Today, however, it only seemed to amplify the tension winding its way through her spine like a live wire.

Her clinic, "Spine & Soul," was nestled on a quiet side street in Ballard, tucked between a bustling bakery and a vintage bookstore. The decor was a whimsical blend of earthy tones, reclaimed wood, and eclectic artwork â€“ a reflection of Ellie's own personality: grounded yet whimsical, practical yet deeply spiritual. 

She glanced at the empty waiting room. No patients had braved the downpour today. It wasn't unusual for appointments to dwindle during storms, but this gnawing emptiness felt different. Like an echo of the hollowness she felt within.  Ellie ran a hand through her unruly auburn curls and sighed, the weight of the day settling heavily on her shoulders.
