The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and regret in The Rusty Tankard.  A grimy haze of cigarette smoke swirled above the heads of patrons hunched over their drinks, each lost in their own world of quiet desperation or boisterous denial. Behind the bar, Amelia Josephine “Millie” Bellwether wiped down a sticky glass with practiced indifference. She wasn't one for sentimentality, especially not in a place like this, where heartache and hope clung to the chipped Formica like cobwebs. 


The Tankard was nestled on the wrong side of town, tucked away between a pawn shop and a laundromat that smelled perpetually of mildew and loneliness. It was the kind of place that whispered secrets under its breath, the kind that held onto stories longer than they should. Millie had been listening to those whispers for ten years now, ever since she'd inherited the bar from her grandfather, a gruff man who believed laughter was the best cure for most ills.  He'd taught her everything she knew about mixing drinks, reading people, and surviving in this forgotten corner of the city. 

Now, as a worn vinyl record crooned a bluesy melody, Millie scanned the room. The usual suspects were present: Old Man Henderson nursing his daily whiskey, Jimmy “Fingers” Finnigan playing a mournful tune on the battered piano, and Sarah Jones with her tear-stained face hidden behind a cocktail napkin. 


The bell above the door jangled, announcing a new arrival. Millie's gaze landed on a man she didn’t recognize, his face obscured by the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat. He moved with a quiet grace that felt out of place in The Rusty Tankard, and for a moment, Millie felt a flicker of something akin to anticipation.  This wasn't your usual crowd. 


What story would he bring?
