The fluorescent lights hummed above Ms. Elara Nightingale's head, casting a sterile glow on the cluttered desks of her seventh-period English class. The late afternoon sun slanted through the grimy windows, painting stripes of gold across the worn linoleum floor. Papers littered every surface: crumpled essays, forgotten assignments, and stray worksheets that looked like they had been through several battles with pencils and erasers.

Elara sighed, adjusting her wire-rimmed glasses and peering at the faces in front of her. Most were already lost in their own worlds â€“ scrolling through phones, doodling in notebooks, or staring blankly into space. A handful, though, held a spark of interest as she launched into her lesson on Shakespeare's sonnets. Elara had always found solace in literature, its timeless beauty and complex narratives offering an escape from the mundane realities of high school life. But lately, even the Bard seemed to struggle for attention against the ever-present distractions of the modern world.  


The bell rang, a jarring chime that brought the students back to their senses. Elara gathered her papers, a familiar ache settling in her shoulders. She longed for the days when literature ignited passion and sparked lively discussions. Instead, she found herself battling apathy and technology's relentless pull. Yet, a sliver of hope remained. One day, she thought, maybe one of these faces would truly see the magic hidden within the words on the page.
