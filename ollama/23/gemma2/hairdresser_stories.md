The smell of lavender shampoo and hairspray hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to  Seraphina Willowbrook. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of "Shear Delight," illuminating strands of golden hair caught in the tangle of her vintage salon chair. Outside, the quaint town of Oakhaven bustled with the energy of a Friday afternoon. But inside, it was Seraphina's domain, a haven built on carefully placed mirrors, comforting whispers, and the magic she wielded with every snip and twist. 

Today, though, the usual tranquility was disrupted by the insistent buzzing of her phone. A new client, someone from out of town, had booked an appointment at the last minute, requesting something "extraordinary."  Seraphina sighed, running a hand through her own perfectly coiffed auburn bob. Extraordinary was her specialty, but this felt different. There was an air of mystery surrounding this request, a hint of something beyond the usual trims and blowouts. Could it be...magic?
