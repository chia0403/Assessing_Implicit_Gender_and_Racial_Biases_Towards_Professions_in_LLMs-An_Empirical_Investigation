The sun beat down on Amelia “Amy” Grace Thornton’s back like an angry blacksmith hammering metal.  Sweat stung her eyes as she wrestled with the tangled mess of orange traffic cones, trying to create a detour around the pothole-ridden stretch of Highway 10. It was another scorcher in August, and this stretch of asphalt baking under the relentless Arizona sun seemed to radiate heat even more intensely than usual.

The wind whipped up dust devils that danced across the cracked pavement, swirling past Amy's worn boots. The only sounds were the distant rumble of trucks on the undamaged lanes and the occasional squawk of a roadrunner, startled by the sudden movement of her flailing arms. The highway stretched ahead, a ribbon of grey snaking its way through the vast, dry landscape.  In the distance, the jagged peaks of the San Pedro Mountains shimmered in the heat haze. 


Amy tugged at her worn baseball cap, wishing she had brought her straw hat today. She squinted at the approaching truck – a semi-trailer hauling a load of unknown cargo – its chrome glinting menacingly in the sun. It was always a gamble maneuvering around these behemoths on such a battered stretch of highway.
