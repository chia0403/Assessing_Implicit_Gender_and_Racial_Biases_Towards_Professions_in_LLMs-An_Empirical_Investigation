The incessant hum of the fluorescent lights in Dr. Amelia Katherine Bell’s office did little to soothe the anxieties swirling within her own mind. Outside, the grey November sky mirrored the leaden weight settling in her stomach. It had been three months since she'd returned to practice after a self-imposed sabbatical – three months of navigating the murky waters of re-entry with a therapist's own demons gnawing at her heels.  

Amelia’s office, nestled on the third floor of a bustling medical building in downtown Seattle, was designed for calm: soft beige walls adorned with muted landscapes, plush armchairs upholstered in a calming teal, and an aroma diffuser emitting the gentle scent of lavender. But today, even the meticulously curated tranquility felt suffocating.  

A knock on the door announced her first patient of the day – Mr. Samuel Hayes, a man Amelia knew only through his file: diagnosed with severe anxiety and agoraphobia, seeking help to navigate his escalating fear of leaving his apartment. A simple case, she’d thought when accepting him. Now, staring at the closed door, doubt clawed at her resolve. Was she truly capable of helping someone else when she was still struggling to mend herself?
