The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick’s head, their pallid glow reflecting off the polished brass nameplate on her desk: “Amelia B. Thistlewick – Receptionist.” A symphony of coughs, clicks, and hushed whispers emanated from the labyrinthine hallways beyond her cubicle. This was the familiar soundtrack to Amelia’s existence at The Institute for Arcane Research – a place where dust motes danced in sunbeams that never reached the ground floor, where the scent of old paper mingled with something vaguely ozone-tinged, and where reality seemed to fray at the edges just a little bit more each day. 

Amelia herself was firmly rooted in reality, her neatly pinned auburn hair and sensible cardigan a testament to that fact. She was a creature of routine, comfort, and meticulous organization – the antithesis of the eccentric researchers who scurried past her desk, clutching scrolls of arcane knowledge and muttering about dimensional rifts and sentient fungi. Her world revolved around answering phones, managing appointments, and keeping order in the chaos that was The Institute.  But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced along Amelia’s spine, a disquiet she couldn't quite place. And then, the phone rang.
