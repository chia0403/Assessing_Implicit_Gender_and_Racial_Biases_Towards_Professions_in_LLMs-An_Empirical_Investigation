The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick's tweed jacket like a damp ghost as he surveyed his domain.  Bartholomew Thistlewick, Head Groundskeeper of Pemberley Manor, was a man perpetually draped in the silence of nature. The sprawling estate, with its manicured lawns and ancient oaks whispering secrets in the breeze, hummed with a life he understood better than most. He could read the language of rustling leaves, the silent plea of wilting blooms, the contented sigh of a well-watered rose bush. 

But this morning, even Bartholomew felt a tremor of unease. The air held an unfamiliar tension, a prickle on the back of his neck that had nothing to do with the lingering chill.  A lone raven perched atop the weathered sundial in the center of the formal gardens, its obsidian eyes fixed on him with unsettling intensity. Its caw echoed through the stillness, a discordant note in the symphony of birdsong. 


Bartholomew sighed and adjusted his worn leather gloves. Something was amiss. He just couldn't put his finger on it yet.
