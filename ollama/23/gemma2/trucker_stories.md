The air hung thick with the smell of diesel and stale coffee, the symphony of idling engines a familiar lullaby to Elias "Eli" Blackwood's ears. He sat slumped in his worn leather captain's chair, the chrome handle of his CB radio glinting under the harsh fluorescent lights of the Denny's diner. Outside, the desolate highway stretched out before him, a ribbon of grey asphalt swallowed by the pre-dawn darkness.  

Eli ran a calloused hand over his unshaven jaw, his eyes reflecting the weariness that clung to him like a second skin. He'd been on the road for days, hauling freight from the steel mills of Pittsburgh to the bustling ports of Los Angeles. The long hours, the endless miles, and the constant hum of loneliness had taken their toll. But Eli knew this life – the rhythm of the open road, the freedom it offered, the tangible reward at each delivery – was all he'd ever known.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A gnawing unease settled in his gut, a prickling sensation that warned him to turn back. Maybe it was the unsettling silence on the CB radio, or the unnatural stillness of the night air. Whatever it was, Eli couldn't shake the feeling that he was heading towards something – or someone – he wasn’t prepared for.
