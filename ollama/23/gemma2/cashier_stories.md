The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Cartwright, casting a sterile glow over the linoleum floor and the mountains of discounted candy lining the checkout counter. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale popcorn and sugary desperation â€“ the aroma of a Tuesday afternoon at "Everything's Gotta Go," a discount store struggling to stay afloat in a sea of online retailers and big-box stores.

Amelia yawned, her name tag dangling precariously from her faded blue uniform shirt. Another day, another parade of bargain hunters and weary souls seeking solace in the aisles. Her fingers tapped impatiently on the scarred wooden countertop, waiting for the next customer to shuffle up with their mismatched collection of discounted goods. Outside, a relentless summer rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the world into an impressionistic wash of grey and green. Amelia watched a lone puddle slowly creep across the cracked pavement, its edges illuminated by a sputtering neon sign advertising "50% Off All Patio Furniture." 


It felt like the entire world was stuck in slow motion, mirroring the sluggish rhythm of her own life.
