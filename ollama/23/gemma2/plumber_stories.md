The insistent drip-drip-drip from Mrs. Peabody's bathroom sink had been driving Arthur Bartholomew "Barth" McTavish to the brink for days. It wasn't just the rhythmic annoyance that chipped away at his sanity; it was the history.  

Arthur, a seasoned plumber with hands rough as sandpaper and a heart softer than the lead pipes he often dealt with, knew this particular sink like the back of his calloused hand. He'd repaired it three times in the last year alone. Each time, Mrs. Peabody, a sweet but stubborn woman who believed herself to be impervious to plumbing woes, would insist on ignoring his warnings about her ancient faucet and the inevitable consequences. 

Now, the consequence was finally here â€“ a leak so persistent it threatened to flood the bathroom and seep into the cozy living room where Mrs. Peabody kept her prized collection of antique teacups. The setting sun cast long shadows through the grime-coated window as Arthur, armed with his trusty wrench and a healthy dose of resignation, approached the house at number 34 Willow Creek Lane.  It was another Tuesday night in Harmony Springs, a sleepy town where even the plumbing seemed to have a mind of its own.
