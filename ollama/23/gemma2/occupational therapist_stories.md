The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Harper as she entered the therapy room. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in its golden rays. It was a typical Tuesday morning at Meadowbrook Rehabilitation Centre – bustling with nurses rushing between rooms, patients engaged in physical exercises, and the gentle clink of utensils against ceramic from the communal breakfast area. 

Amelia, however, found solace in the quiet hum of routine. She adjusted her lilac-coloured scrubs and smoothed down the unruly curls that escaped her braid.  Her gaze fell upon the whiteboard where she’d meticulously charted Sarah Jenkins’ progress: "Fine motor skills improving - able to grasp small objects for 30 seconds.” Amelia smiled, remembering Sarah’s triumphant grin when she'd managed to successfully thread a needle last week. This was why Amelia loved her job – witnessing these small victories, the light returning to eyes that had once held only despair.  

Today, however, a different kind of case awaited her. A new patient, Mr. Thomas Blackwood, arrived this morning. He’d been admitted after a severe stroke, his left side paralyzed and his speech severely impaired. Amelia had reviewed his file – a successful architect who lost everything in an instant. She felt a surge of empathy, knowing that his journey to recovery would be both physically and emotionally challenging. 


  As she prepared for her session with Mr. Blackwood, Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the unknown. This wasn’t just about rehabilitating muscles; it was about rebuilding a life, piece by painstaking piece.
