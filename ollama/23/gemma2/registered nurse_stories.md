The fluorescent lights hummed a tired melody above Amelia Grace Thorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the worn linoleum floor of the emergency room. A symphony of coughs, beeps, and muffled sobs filled the air, punctuated by the sharp barks of Dr. Singhâ€™s orders echoing down the crowded hallway. Amelia, her nametag pinned neatly above her chest pocket, maneuvered through the chaos with practiced ease.  

Her shift had started like any other: triage, vitals, medication administration. But something felt different tonight. A prickling sensation on the back of her neck, a sense that she was being watched.  Maybe it was the lingering scent of antiseptic and fear, or perhaps it was the shadowed figure standing at the far end of the waiting room, shrouded in darkness and whispering urgently into their phone. Whatever it was, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that this night was about to become anything but ordinary.
