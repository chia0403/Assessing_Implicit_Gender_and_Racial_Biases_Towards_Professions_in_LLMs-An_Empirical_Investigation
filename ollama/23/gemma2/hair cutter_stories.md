The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and freshly-cut hair in "Shear Perfection," a quaint salon tucked away on Maple Street. Sunlight slanted through the dusty front window, illuminating motes dancing in the air alongside strands of auburn, blonde, and raven that clung stubbornly to the worn linoleum floor. Amelia “Amy” Beatrice Thompson, her name tag gleaming beneath a cascade of fiery curls, hummed along to the jazzy tunes playing softly from the vintage radio perched on a shelf behind the counter. 

Amy’s nimble fingers worked magic with shears and combs. Each snip, each twist, transformed not just hair but personalities. A nervous student seeking confidence in a new haircut, a middle-aged woman yearning for a touch of youthfulness, even the grumpy old man who came in every Tuesday for his trim – they all left Shear Perfection feeling a little bit better than when they walked in. 


But today was different. Today, Amy felt a prickle of anticipation, a flutter in her stomach that had nothing to do with the usual bustle of clients. A woman stood outside, shrouded in an aura of mystery. She wore a long, flowing coat that concealed her features, her face hidden behind a wide-brimmed hat.  A shiver ran down Amy’s spine – this was no ordinary client. This was someone who carried secrets, someone with a story waiting to be told, and perhaps, even someone who needed Amy's magic touch more than anyone else.
