The acrid scent of ozone hung thick in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of spilled solder. Amelia "Amy" Juniper wiped her forehead with a grease-stained rag, leaving a fresh streak across her already grime-covered face. The tiny workshop was crammed with discarded electronics: radios, amplifiers, televisions – each one a potential treasure trove of parts or a heartbreaking reminder of failure. A thin shaft of late afternoon sunlight pierced through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stagnant air. 

Amy leaned over her workbench, meticulously stripping wires from an ancient transistor radio. It wasn't much, but its delicate tuning knob and faded Bakelite casing held a certain charm.  A soft crackle erupted from the receiver, followed by a distorted, unintelligible voice. A faint flicker of excitement danced in Amy’s eyes – a familiar thrill that never failed to electrify her. 

This wasn't just about fixing broken machines; it was about uncovering secrets hidden within their tangled circuits, breathing life back into forgotten stories whispered through the ether. And this radio, with its garbled whispers, promised to be particularly intriguing.  


**Setting:** A cluttered, dimly lit workshop in a forgotten corner of an aging city, filled with the scent of ozone and solder.
