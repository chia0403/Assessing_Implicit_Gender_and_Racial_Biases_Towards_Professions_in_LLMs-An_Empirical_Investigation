The sun was already an angry smear across the bruised horizon, casting long shadows that stretched like tired arms from the half-built skeleton of the new skyscraper.  Acrid dust hung heavy in the air, stinging Elias "Eli" Jackson's nostrils as he adjusted his hard hat and cracked his knuckles. He squinted at the steel beams towering above him, each one a testament to the ambition that pulsed through this city â€“ an ambition Eli both admired and resented. 

He wasn't born into this world of concrete and glass. His father had been a carpenter, his hands rough but gentle, crafting intricate furniture with the patience of a saint. But Eli had traded the scent of sawdust for the metallic tang of welding and learned to speak the language of blueprints and heavy machinery.  There was a certain pride in building something tangible, something that would stand long after he was gone. Yet, sometimes, looking up at these monstrous towers, he felt like just another cog in a machine, a nameless face lost in the endless cycle of construction and demolition.  


This city was a hungry beast, always demanding more, always reaching for the sky. And Eli, well, he was just another brick in its wall.
