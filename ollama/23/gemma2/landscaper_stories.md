The July sun beat down on Alistair Finch's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat plastered his brown hair to his forehead, making it difficult to see the intricate pattern he was weaving with the hostas. He wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of dirt across his face.

Alistair worked in Highcliff Gardens, a sprawling estate perched on a cliff overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. The gardens were a patchwork of manicured lawns, vibrant flowerbeds, and ancient trees that whispered secrets to the wind. It was Alistair's responsibility to keep this delicate ecosystem thriving, a task he took pride in with the same fervor a sculptor treats his marble.

Today, though, his usual sense of tranquility was shattered by the arrival of Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood, the estate's formidable mistress. Her icy blue eyes scanned the garden, her expression as unyielding as the granite walls that enclosed it. Alistair knew she had something to say, and judging by the tightly pursed lips, it wouldn't be pleasant.
