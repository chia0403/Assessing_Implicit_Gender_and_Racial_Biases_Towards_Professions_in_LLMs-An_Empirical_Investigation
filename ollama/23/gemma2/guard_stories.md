The biting wind whipped across the plains of Aethelgard, carrying with it the scent of snow and fear.  A thin veil of mist clung to the ground, obscuring the skeletal remains of fallen trees and the desolate landscape beyond.  The sun, a pale disc in the bruised sky, offered little warmth. Elias Thorne, his breath frosting in the air, tightened the grip on his sword hilt. He was just a guard, one amongst many tasked with defending the fortress walls from the encroaching shadows that haunted Aethelgard's heart. But tonight, Elias felt different. Tonight, the silence held a deeper meaning, a pregnant stillness before the storm. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change â€“ something monstrous.  

The fortress itself loomed above, its stone ramparts blackened by countless fires and scarred with the wounds of past battles. The flickering torchlight cast long, dancing shadows on the faces of his fellow guards, their expressions grim and resolute. They huddled together for warmth, their eyes constantly scanning the horizon, searching for any sign of movement in the swirling mist.
