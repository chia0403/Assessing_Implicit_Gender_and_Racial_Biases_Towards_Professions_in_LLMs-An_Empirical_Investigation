The wail of sirens sliced through the humid July night air, a familiar melody to Elias Thorne, EMT-Paramedic.  He gripped the steering wheel tighter, his jaw clenched against the rhythmic pulse of the ambulance’s lights flashing on and off. The dispatcher’s voice crackled through the radio, “Thorne, ETA two minutes to 421 Elm Street, possible cardiac arrest, unresponsive male.” Elias glanced at his partner, Lily Reyes, her focus already fixed on the medical kit laid out across the back seat.

They were in South Bend, Indiana, a city where summer nights shimmered with humidity and cicada song.  The air hung thick and heavy, carrying the scent of freshly cut grass and distant grilling smoke. A streetlight flickered erratically ahead, casting long, distorted shadows on the cracked asphalt road leading to Elm Street. The scene was already unfolding in Elias' mind - a frantic 911 call, the desperate pleas from neighbors, the grim stillness of an unresponsive patient. He prayed this one wouldn’t be another notch on his belt.
