The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across the deserted hallway. The rhythmic squeak of Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's mop echoed through the empty space, the only sound besides the distant hum of the air conditioning system struggling to keep the temperature down in the aging building. 

Amelia pushed her mop bucket across the linoleum floor with a tired sigh. It was 3:00 AM and she was alone as usual â€“  another graveyard shift at the Grandview Historical Society museum. The vast, echoing halls of the Victorian mansion, usually bustling with tourists by day, felt like an empty tomb in the dead of night. She'd spent years meticulously cleaning up after the curious crowds, wiping away sticky fingerprints from ancient artifacts and sweeping crumbs from the priceless rug where children had played pretend explorers just hours before. 

Tonight, though, she found herself staring at a particularly dusty portrait hanging over the fireplace in the Grand Hall. The stern face of a long-dead benefactor, his eyes seeming to follow her every move, seemed to mock her solitude. Amelia wondered if he ever felt lonely, presiding over this silent house full of whispers of forgotten lives.  Maybe it was time for her own story to be told, she thought, even if it was just in the echo of her mop across the cold floorboards.
