The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the scent of exotic spices lingered in the air of "Wanderlust Voyages". Amelia Rose Beaumont adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the scene before her – maps plastered across every wall, postcards from far-flung corners of the world pinned haphazardly on corkboards, and a kaleidoscope of travel brochures stacked precariously high. A soft jazz melody played in the background, adding to the atmosphere of serene wanderlust that permeated Amelia's tiny, yet perfectly curated, travel agency nestled in the heart of bustling London.

Amelia, a woman whose veins seemed to run with jet fuel and whose imagination was fueled by stories whispered on windswept beaches and etched into ancient ruins, thrived amidst the organized chaos. Her mind was a map itself, crisscrossed with routes she'd travelled, dreamt of travelling, and meticulously charted for her clients.  Today, however, was different. A thick stack of unclaimed postcards lay on her desk, each bearing a cryptic message scrawled in faded ink. This wasn't the usual fare of honeymooners requesting tropical getaways or retirees seeking sun-drenched cruises. These postcards hinted at something…more.
