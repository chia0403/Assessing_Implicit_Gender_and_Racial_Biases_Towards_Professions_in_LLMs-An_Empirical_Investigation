Eleanor Primrose clutched a steaming mug of Earl Grey between her gloved hands, its warmth radiating against her stiff fingers as she surveyed the hushed rows of books in the Reading Room.

But this letter promised something new, something beyond the familiar comfort of her well-worn volumes. It hinted at a mystery waiting to be uncovered, and Eleanor couldn't help but feel a thrill course through her veins.
