The flickering neon sign outside "Lucky's Last Chance Diner" cast an anemic glow over Detective Alistair Thorneâ€™s trench coat. He sat hunched in a booth, nursing a lukewarm coffee that tasted more like regret than caffeine. Rain lashed against the greasy windows, blurring the city skyline into an impressionist painting of grimy yellows and bruised purples. 

Alistair wasn't much for romanticism. The rain was just another obstacle on a long night in a city that never slept, especially not when your name was Alistair Thorne, Private Investigator.  His latest case - missing heiress Penelope Van Derlyn, last seen at a masked ball downtown - felt more like wading through quicksand than solving a mystery. 


He took a drag from his cigarette, watching the smoke curl up towards the cracked ceiling. He needed a break, something to cut through the fog of this case, but the only other option was another double shot of whiskey, and that could lead down a dangerous path.  Then he saw her. A woman, shrouded in darkness, slipping into the diner unnoticed. She looked like she'd just walked out of Penelope's missing person flyer - elegant, terrified, and carrying a single red rose, its petals glistening with raindrops. Alistair knew this was no ordinary customer.
