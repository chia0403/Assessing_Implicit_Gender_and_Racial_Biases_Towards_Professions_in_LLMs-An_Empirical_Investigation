The air hung thick with the scent of sizzling garlic and frying onions, punctuated by the rhythmic clinking of cutlery against porcelain.  A low hum of conversation buzzed around Eleanor "Ellie" Rose as she weaved through tables at The Rusty Spatula, her tray laden with steaming plates of spaghetti carbonara. 

Ellie loved the chaos. The late-night rush at The Rusty Spatula, a dimly lit Italian joint tucked away on a quiet side street in Chicago, was a symphony of noise and movement.  It was demanding, yes, but it also felt alive, like a pulsating heart beating beneath the worn floorboards.  She knew every inch of this place â€“ from the chipped paint on the booths to the wobbly table by the window where old Mr. Henderson always sat with his crossword puzzle.

Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced at the back of Ellie's neck as she caught a glimpse of a man sitting in a shadowed corner booth. He was tall and broad-shouldered, his face hidden behind the brim of a fedora. His presence seemed to drain the warmth from the room, casting an unsettling chill over the usual jovial atmosphere.  


Ellie hesitated, unsure if it was her imagination playing tricks on her. But as she approached the man's booth, a sense of foreboding tightened its grip on her. This wasn't just another regular Friday night at The Rusty Spatula.
