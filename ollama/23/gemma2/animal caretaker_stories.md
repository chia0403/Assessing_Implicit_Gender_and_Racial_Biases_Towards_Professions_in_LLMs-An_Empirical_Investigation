The morning mist clung stubbornly to the eucalyptus trees lining the perimeter fence of Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary, shrouding the sprawling grounds in an ethereal veil.  Sunlight struggled to pierce through, casting long, dancing shadows across the dew-kissed grass. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, affectionately known as "Amy" by the residents of the sanctuary, knelt beside a small, shivering goat kid, its tiny hooves struggling to find purchase on the slick earth. 

Whispering Pines was Amy's lifeblood, her haven for forgotten and injured creatures. It wasn't much – a patchwork of rescued land nestled amidst rolling hills an hour outside bustling Portland, Oregon – but it was hers.  Each rustle in the undergrowth, each chirping bird, each bleat from the distant sheep pen held a story, a silent plea for care and compassion that Amy answered with unwavering devotion.  


Today, however, something felt different. The air hummed with an unseen energy, a prickling sensation on Amy's skin that sent goosebumps crawling up her arms.
