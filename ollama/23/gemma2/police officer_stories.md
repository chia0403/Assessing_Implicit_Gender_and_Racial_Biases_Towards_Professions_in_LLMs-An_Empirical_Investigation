Rain lashed against the cracked windshield of Officer Amelia "Amy" Harding's cruiser, blurring the neon glow of the "24 Hour Diner" sign across the street. The diner’s flickering yellow light cast long shadows that danced with the swaying palm trees lining Ocean Avenue. It was 3:00 AM, a time when the beach town of Sea Haven usually slept, but tonight, the air buzzed with an uneasy energy.  

Amy gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather. The dispatcher’s voice echoed in her ear, "Possible domestic disturbance at 1247 Ocean Avenue. Suspect armed and possibly intoxicated. Proceed with caution, Officer Harding." Amy swallowed hard. Domestic disturbances were never simple, but this one felt different, a chill crawling up her spine despite the humid summer air. 


She knew 1247 well – an old Victorian house with peeling paint and overgrown ivy, perched precariously on the edge of a bluff overlooking the turbulent ocean.  It was a place that whispered secrets in the wind. Tonight, those secrets seemed to be screaming.
