The stale scent of recycled air hung heavy in the cabin as Elena "Ellie" Ramirez expertly maneuvered down the aisle, her practiced smile plastered on like a well-worn decal. She paused at row 12, extending a cup of lukewarm coffee to a harried businessman with perpetually sweaty palms, before gliding gracefully towards the galley.  

The setting sun cast long, fiery hues across the endless expanse of the Atlantic Ocean below. The plane was a Boeing 747, affectionately nicknamed "The Queen" by the crew, its aging interior a mosaic of faded leather and worn carpets. It trundled through the sky at 35,000 feet, a floating metal cocoon carrying a hundred souls on their respective journeys, some mundane, some life-altering. Ellie, however, was used to the rhythm of these journeys. She had been a flight attendant for seven years, her passport a testament to her nomadic lifestyle. But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine, an intuition whispering that this routine flight would soon become anything but ordinary.
