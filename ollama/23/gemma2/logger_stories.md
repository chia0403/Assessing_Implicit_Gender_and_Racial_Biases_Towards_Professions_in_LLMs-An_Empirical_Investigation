The early morning mist clung to Elijah Thornton like a damp shroud as he stepped out of his cabin. The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and woodsmoke, a familiar aroma that had permeated every corner of his life. A sliver of pale sunlight broke through the dense canopy above, illuminating the dew-laden grass in an ethereal glow.

Elijah ran a calloused hand over his beard, its bristles stiff from sleep and the ever-present dampness of the forest. He was a man sculpted by the woods, strong and weathered, with eyes that held the quiet intensity of someone who knew every twist and turn of these ancient trees.  The logging camp lay nestled in the valley below, a cluster of makeshift buildings huddled around the roaring bonfire that served as their heart. The rhythmic clang of hammers against steel echoed up from the clearing, a sound that had become the soundtrack to Elijah's life.  


Today was different, though. Today, the whispers started to circulate about a new job, a logging contract deeper in the forbidden part of the forest. A place where legends whispered and shadows danced, where trees stood taller than any man dared to dream and secrets slept beneath centuries-old roots. It was a job that would test even the most seasoned logger, a gamble that promised both fortune and peril.
