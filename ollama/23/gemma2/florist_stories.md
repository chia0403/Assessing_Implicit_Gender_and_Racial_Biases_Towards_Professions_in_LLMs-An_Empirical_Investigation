The scent of lilies was cloying, even for Rosalind Violet Everleigh. It clung to her apron, her hair, her very being, reminding her that today was another day at Roses & Thorns. Not that she particularly minded. She loved flowers, each bloom a tiny universe bursting with color and fragrance. Still, the relentless perfume of lilies on this particular Tuesday morning felt oppressive, mirroring the weight settling in her chest.

Roses & Thorns wasn't just any flower shop; it was a legacy. Her grandmother, Clementine Everleigh, had built it from scratch, her love for blossoms woven into every brick and mortar. Rosalind inherited not only the shop but also Clementine’s unspoken expectations – to carry on her grandmother’s passion, to bring joy through flowers, to be the heart of their quaint seaside town of Seahaven. 

The morning sun streamed through the dusty front window, casting long shadows across a riot of blooms: vibrant sunflowers reaching for the light, delicate orchids huddled together like shy friends, and a cascade of crimson roses, their velvety petals whispering secrets only they knew.  Seahaven was a sleepy town, its charm hidden behind faded Victorian houses and cobblestone streets that whispered stories of bygone days. The air buzzed with the gentle hum of seagulls and the rhythmic lapping of waves against the shore, a soothing soundtrack to Rosalind's day.


But today, even the beauty around her couldn’t quite drown out the anxiety twisting in her gut. A new rival florist had opened up just down the street – “Bloom & Bark” - offering trendy arrangements with bold colours and modern designs. They were stealing customers, whispers of their success swirling through Seahaven like a summer breeze. Rosalind was fighting an uphill battle, trying to hold onto her grandmother’s legacy while facing the uncertainties of change.
