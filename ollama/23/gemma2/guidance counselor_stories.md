Posters depicting smiling teenagers achieving their dreams - posters Ellie found increasingly ironic - adorned the walls, while a half-eaten bag of stale pretzels sat precariously on the edge of her desk. Outside, the wind howled through the skeletal branches of the oak tree that shaded the schoolyard, its mournful moan echoing the unsettling emptiness Ellie felt within her own heart.
