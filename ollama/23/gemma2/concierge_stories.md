The velvet ropes felt cool against Amelia Rose Dubois's fingertips as she expertly ushered the latest guest into The Grand Celeste Hotel. Rain lashed against the arched windows, blurring the Parisian skyline beyond, turning it into a hazy watercolor dream. The lobby was alive with the murmur of hushed conversations and the soft clink of champagne glasses, a symphony of elegance that Amelia orchestrated with practiced ease. 

She adjusted her crisp white blouse, smoothing down the perfectly knotted emerald green ribbon at her collar – a signature touch of flair she added to the otherwise standard uniform. Her dark eyes, perpetually alight with intelligence and warmth, surveyed the scene, ready to anticipate every need before it was even voiced.  


"Madame Dubois," a voice whispered from behind her. It was Henri, the head waiter, gesturing towards a man in a trench coat huddled by the fireplace, looking decidedly out of place amidst the opulence. "He seems… troubled."

Amelia's lips curved into a knowing smile. Troubled? In The Grand Celeste? Never truly. There was always a story behind every guest, a whisper of intrigue beneath their polished veneer. This one, she suspected, had a particularly compelling tale to tell. 


With a graceful glide, Amelia approached the man, her presence as calming as the amber glow emanating from the fireplace.
