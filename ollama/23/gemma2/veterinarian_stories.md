The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne. Her small clinic, nestled on a sun-drenched corner of Oakhaven Lane, hummed with the usual morning bustle: a chirping parakeet recovering from a wing injury, a grumpy ginger cat demanding his breakfast, and the steady thump of her assistant's footfalls as she rushed around prepping for the day. Amelia loved this small chaos, the warmth of furry bodies against her hands, and the quiet miracle of mending broken bones and soothing troubled hearts, both animal and human.

But today felt different.  A tightness coiled in her chest, a premonition that clung to her like cobwebs. 

The phone rang, shattering the morning tranquility. Amelia picked up the receiver, her smile fading as the voice on the other end spoke. "Dr. Hawthorne? It's Mrs. Peterson from Willow Creek Farm. Her prize-winning bull... he's fallen ill." 


Amelia felt the premonition tighten its grip. Willow Creek was miles outside town, a sprawling farm with a reputation for breeding champion livestock. She had only ever treated their small animals, never anything as large as a bull. The weight of responsibility settled on her shoulders, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort of her clinic.
