The grease stained the air like a perpetual haze, clinging to Elias "Eli" Blackwood's beard and the tattered sleeve of his denim jacket. His workshop, tucked away on a side street in the shadow of towering steel mills, was a symphony of clangs, rattles, and the hiss of escaping steam.  A half-dismantled 1967 Mustang sat on a hoist, its crimson paint dulled by decades of rust and neglect, and a leaky radiator wept onto the concrete floor. Eli, his calloused hands coated in a rainbow of engine oil, squinted at the carburetor through the fluorescent hum of the single overhead bulb. He knew this beast better than most people knew their families – every groan, every sputter, whispered secrets only he could understand. 


He was used to the grime, the constant symphony of repair, the smell that clung to his clothes like a second skin. It was the rhythm of his life, the lullaby of his soul.  His father had taught him everything he knew, instilling in him a love for these mechanical monsters, a respect for their inner workings, and an almost spiritual connection to the rumble of a well-tuned engine. This workshop, passed down from his father, was more than just a business – it was his legacy, his sanctuary, and tonight, like every night before, it felt like home.
