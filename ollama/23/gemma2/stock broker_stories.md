The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation in Ethan Alistair Blackwood's cramped Manhattan office. Outside, the city hummed with the usual frenetic energy, oblivious to the slow-motion car crash unfolding within his four walls.  

Ethan leaned back in his ergonomic chair, a groan escaping his lips as his shoulders tightened. The Nasdaq had taken another nosedive, wiping out his clients' portfolios faster than he could say "market volatility." He ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair, the knot at the base of his skull throbbing in time with the incessant pinging of his Bloomberg terminal. His phone never stopped ringing, each call bringing more bad news, more panicked voices pleading for salvation.  

Ethan knew he was losing control, but there was nowhere to run. This wasn't just a job; it was his family's legacy, his ticket out of the working-class world heâ€™d been born into. He had to fix this, no matter the cost. 


The setting is Ethan Alistair Blackwood's office in Manhattan during a financial crisis. The atmosphere is tense and claustrophobic, reflecting the turmoil within Ethan himself.
