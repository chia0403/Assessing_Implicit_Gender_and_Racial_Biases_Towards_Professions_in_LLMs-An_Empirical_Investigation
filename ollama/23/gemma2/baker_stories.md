The bell above the door to "Butter & Bloom" chimed softly as Eleanor Hazelwood dusted flour from her apron. Another day, another sunrise spilling across the cobblestone streets of Willow Creek. The scent of warm sourdough and cinnamon lingered in the air, a comforting aroma that had become synonymous with her little bakery on Maple Street.  

Eleanor loved this time of morning - the quiet before the rush began. She'd take a deep breath, savoring the stillness, then slip into the rhythm of kneading dough, whisking cream, and shaping loaves. Her hands moved with practiced ease, guided by years of experience and a love for transforming simple ingredients into edible masterpieces. Today was special though; it was the annual Willow Creek Harvest Festival, and Eleanor had spent days perfecting her signature pumpkin spice bread for the competition. 


But as she turned to check on her sourdough starter, a shadow fell across the doorway.  A young woman stood hesitantly in the entrance, clutching a worn leather satchel and her gaze darted nervously around the cozy bakery. This wasn't a customer Eleanor recognized. Her heart, usually light with the joy of baking, skipped a beat. 


What could bring someone like that to "Butter & Bloom" on such a crisp autumn morning?
