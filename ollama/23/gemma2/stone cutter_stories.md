The air in Corvus's workshop hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and whetstone. Sunlight streamed through the open doorway, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its golden rays. The rhythmic clink of his hammer against chisel echoed off the rough-hewn walls, a familiar lullaby to Elias Stonehand, master stone cutter of Aldoria.  

Elias ran a calloused thumb over the smooth surface of a pale moonstone he was carving. It was to be part of a sundial for Lord Alaric, a commission that would bring him a good deal of coin and further solidify his reputation as the finest craftsman in the city. But lately, a gnawing unease had taken root within Elias. The stones seemed duller, their veins less vibrant. His dreams were plagued by whispers of an ancient curse, one that threatened to engulf Aldoria in darkness.  

He pushed aside the unsettling thoughts, focusing on his work. He needed this commission to succeed. He needed to keep his head down and avoid attracting unwanted attention from those who sought to exploit the city's growing fear. 


Aldoria was a city built upon stone, its towering walls and intricate architecture testaments to the skill of its artisans. Yet beneath the veneer of prosperity, shadows lurked, whispers of unrest and fear spreading like a contagion. A chill wind seemed to carry with it the scent of decay, a harbinger of something darker at play.
