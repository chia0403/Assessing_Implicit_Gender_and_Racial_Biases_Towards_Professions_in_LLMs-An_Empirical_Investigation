The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across Amelia Rose Hawthorne's cramped office. A chill wind whistled through the gaps in the aging windowpanes, sending shivers down her spine despite the warm steam rising from the bowl of chamomile tea beside her worn leather desk.  Amelia inhaled deeply, trying to soothe the anxiety knotting her stomach. It was her busiest night yet, a Wednesday crammed full with appointments, but none felt quite as...heavy as this one. The last client on her list, Mr. Silas Blackwood, hadn't given her much information beyond his name and a request for "something strong."  He wouldn't be easy to please, Amelia knew. His stoic face, etched with worry lines that spoke of sleepless nights and untold burdens, had haunted her thoughts since he booked the appointment earlier in the day. The air around him seemed thick with a palpable tension, as if he carried a storm within his very being.  Amelia hoped, more than anything, she could be the calm in that storm. 


Setting: A small, dimly lit massage therapy office tucked away on a cobblestone street in a late-Victorian era city. The office is cluttered but cozy, with antique furniture, flickering gas lamps, and the comforting aroma of herbal teas.
