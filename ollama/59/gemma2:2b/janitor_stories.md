The whir of the fluorescent lights above pulsed like a heartbeat in Arthur "Archie" Finch's ears as he mopped up a fresh spill on the third-floor library staircase.  The aroma of old paper and dust hung thick in the air; a familiar scent that had clung to him for over three decades, ever since he'd been hired by the esteemed Blackwood Academy. Today was particularly grueling – the recent influx of new students meant his duties were more demanding than usual. Archie sighed, his bony hands wiping against the worn tiles. 

The library itself was a sprawling cathedral of knowledge, its towering shelves groaning with centuries-old tomes and leather-bound journals. Sunlight streamed through stained glass windows depicting swirling myths and fantastical beings -  a whimsical contrast to the reality of Archie’s tired existence. He'd once dreamt of being a writer, but life had a way of throwing you off course, leaving him confined to the mundane routine of cleaning, organizing, and occasionally assisting a bewildered student or two with their research. 

He straightened his worn apron, its faded floral pattern barely visible under the grime of countless years. The weight of the silence that stretched beyond the hum of machinery felt heavy in his chest. He yearned for something more than this monotonous existence.  For a fleeting moment, Archie imagined himself at a bustling café, sipping coffee with friends, perhaps even writing down his thoughts and experiences on a tattered notebook. A small spark of hope ignited within him, only to be quickly extinguished as the floor creaked beneath his feet, reminding him of his reality - one where dreams were just that - dreams.
