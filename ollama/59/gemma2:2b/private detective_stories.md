Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Thorne's office like tiny fists pounding on glass. A symphony of despair echoed through her soul as she stared at the file in her hands – a single photograph of a young woman with eyes that held too much pain and a smile that was all but gone. Her name, it read: Celeste Bellweather. 

Amelia Thorne wasn't your typical private detective. She wore tailored dresses instead of trench coats, carried a vintage leather briefcase overflowing with more questions than answers, and preferred the quiet murmur of the city to the cacophony of a nightclub floor.  A world away from her glamorous neighbor, Amelia lived a life painted in shades of grainy black and white: smoky jazz bars, abandoned bookstores, and forgotten back alleys – places where truth was hidden like dust motes dancing in the sun. 

Tonight's case felt different. There was a desperation in Celeste's gaze that mirrored Amelia's own, years spent navigating a city where shadows held more secrets than sunlight ever did.  Amelia took a sip of her black coffee, letting its bitterness linger on her tongue as she closed her eyes and let the echoes of a long-forgotten melody play out in her mind.
