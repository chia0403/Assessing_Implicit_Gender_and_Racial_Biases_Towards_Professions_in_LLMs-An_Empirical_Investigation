The bell above the door chimed as if in greeting, but it felt like a rusty sigh coming from a long-retired machine.  "Another soul wandering into the storm," grumbled Elias "Lucky" Finchley, his eyes catching the worn reflection of the flickering neon sign that cast a sickly green glow over his cluttered shop, "The Stormy Shear." His hands, roughened with years of wielding shears and battling stubborn tangles, went to smooth down his own already-tousled hair, its salt-and-pepper streaks matching the storm brewing outside. 

Elias was the only one who dared call it a "storm" in the tiny coastal town of Oakhaven.  It wasn't the real kind – no howling winds or crashing waves here. It was just…different. The air held a constant, nervous tension as if someone had stuck a pinhole into the fabric of reality and let loose a steady stream of unsettling whispers. 

Lucky ran his fingers through a thick braid that adorned one of his own models' heads – it seemed like every girl in Oakhaven was trying to outdo the last with their unique hairstyles. He wasn’t sure what it meant, this tension he felt, but it made his work feel almost…sacred. His scissors were tools not for creation but for something more profound.
