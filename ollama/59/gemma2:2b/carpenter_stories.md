The scent of sawdust clung to Theodore Blackwood like an old friend, each grain a whisper of stories long past. He sat hunched over his workbench in the dusty workshop at the edge of Oakhaven, the only light filtering through a grime-streaked window.  His hands, weathered and gnarled like ancient driftwood, caressed the smooth, raw wood before him. 

This wasn't just any piece of lumber; it was a heart, pulsating with an unknown future. He had been commissioned by Eleanor Thorne, a woman whose face was as sharp and unforgiving as a hawk’s talon, to build her dream - a sprawling conservatory for the burgeoning flora she intended to cultivate. 

Oakhaven, a town rooted in tradition and whispering tales of forgotten legends, held its breath. Theodore was known for his meticulous craftsmanship, but this project threatened to break him. He'd always been more comfortable with his own wood-worn solitude than the swirling tides of ambition that Eleanor seemed to wield. The walls of the workshop were filled not just with blueprints but also with memories - his mother’s whispered advice etched in wood shavings, her laughter resonating like a long-gone hymn, and the quiet sting of regret he refused to name. 


He felt a familiar unease creep into his heart as he started carving. It wasn't just the intricately intricate design of Eleanor's conservatory that had him on edge, but something deeper, rooted in the memories he dared not confront. The silence was deafening, filled only by the rhythmic rasp of his tools and the ghost of what could have been. 


Theodore knew this project held more than just wood and glass; it held the keys to a life he thought he'd buried deep within himself.
