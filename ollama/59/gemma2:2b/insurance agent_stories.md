The salt spray stung Elara Thorne's face as she stood on the dock, watching the freighter slip away into the endless expanse of the Atlantic. Her weathered leather briefcase felt heavier than usual, burdened not only by stacks of policy forms and client complaints but also by the weight of her own loneliness.  She adjusted the worn fedora perched on her brow and let out a slow sigh.  Her life was built on promises â€“ promises to secure people's futures against unforeseen circumstances, promises of stability in the face of the unpredictable chaos of life.

Her small coastal town was quaint, almost idyllic in its tranquility. Yet, it lacked the vibrancy that fuelled her restless spirit. She'd come here seeking solace, yet found herself trapped in a routine that seemed destined to repeat itself for years to come.
