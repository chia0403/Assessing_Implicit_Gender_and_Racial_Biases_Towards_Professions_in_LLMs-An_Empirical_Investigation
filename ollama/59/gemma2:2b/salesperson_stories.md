Rain hammered against the dusty windows of "The Curios," a quaint shop nestled amidst cobblestone streets in Old Salem, New Hampshire. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of aging wood and forgotten dreams as Amelia Thorne, known to her friends as Millie, straightened a tarnished silver teacup on a shelf overflowing with antique china. The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered space â€“ each corner whispering stories of bygone eras. 

It was a Wednesday, one of Millie's busiest days, and a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach as she glanced at the clock.  She had to find the right customer today; someone who would understand the weight of these fragile pieces, the stories etched into their porcelain or wood, and appreciate them for what they truly were: remnants of lives lived and loved before the world moved on.
