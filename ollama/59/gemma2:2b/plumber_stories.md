## The Gushing Goblin

**Setting:** A ramshackle apartment building in Oakland, California. Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, each drop echoing like thunder across the worn ceramic tiles. 

**Main Character:**  Ethan Miller, affectionately nicknamed "Fix-It" by his clientele. At 32, Ethan was a man of average height, built like an oak tree with calloused hands and eyes that seemed perpetually tired, yet filled with an unwavering optimism. His days were spent unclogging drains, repairing leaky pipes, and navigating the city's labyrinthine plumbing system, each call leaving him with a knot in his gut and a growing sense of responsibility for the chaotic dance of water and infrastructure that kept this bustling city alive. 

Ethan sighed as he stepped out of his battered work van, its exhaust fumes mixing with the damp smell of petrichor. A single flickering fluorescent bulb cast an eerie glow over his toolbox â€“ metal groaning under the weight of years of grime and sweat. It was time to face another day, yet Ethan felt strangely detached from it all. 

"Just gotta get this gushing goblin cleaned up," he muttered to himself, tracing a calloused finger across the rusty handle of his wrench. The problem wasn't just a leaky pipe; it was a symbol, a microcosm of everything that had gone wrong in his life lately: a cascade of bad luck and misplaced expectations, like water cascading down an unfinished drain.
