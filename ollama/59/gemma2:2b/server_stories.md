Rain hammered against the grimy windows of The Golden Lantern, blurring the neon glow of Times Square into an abstract kaleidoscope. Inside, the air thrummed with a familiar mix of cigarette smoke, cheap cologne, and last night's spilled margaritas. This was Elara "Ellie" Blackwood's battleground – her domain of clattering silverware and tired dreams. As the third shift began to wind down, Ellie straightened her worn uniform, its crimson apron stained with more than just ketchup stains from countless late-night fries runs. She ran a hand over the smooth surface of a chipped mug, her eyes tracing the faded inscription: "Ellie's Best Friend."

The bar's door chimed as another customer entered, silhouetted against the neon blur. Ellie knew him – Arthur “Big Al” Malone, a former boxer with biceps the size of small suitcases and a heart softer than his reputation suggested. Al liked to think he was just looking for a quiet beer after a long day at the construction site, but Ellie saw something deeper in those steely eyes: a worn-down warrior struggling to find peace, and maybe a moment of genuine happiness. 

This night, though, felt different. The air crackled with an uncharacteristic tension that seemed to vibrate against Ellie's bones.  A shadow stretched across the table Al usually favored, hiding his usual boisterous self behind it. And in this shadow, she saw another familiar face: a man whose presence sent shivers down her spine and who whispered more about trouble than warmth. It was Edward, the one person who could make even the most comforting hum of The Golden Lantern turn sour.
