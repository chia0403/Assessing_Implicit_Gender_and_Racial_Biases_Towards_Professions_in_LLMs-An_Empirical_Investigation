The morning mist clung to the cobbled streets like a ghost, blurring the gaslight into anemic splashes of yellow against a backdrop of charcoal rooftops. Inside "The Butcher's Block", Bartholomew Grimshaw was already surrounded by the familiar symphony of his craft. The rhythmic clang of meat cleavers on bone, the rasping hiss of knives slicing through fat, the steady thudding of meat being stacked on shelves; it was the morning ballet he performed with practiced ease, each movement honed to perfection over years of trade. 

Bartholomew, a towering man built like a weathered oak, his face etched with the lines of countless seasons spent under the harsh glare of the butcher's lamp, surveyed his domain. His worn leather apron was stained the colours of every customer's desires - crimson from a celebratory roast, pale pink from delicate cured hams, and a deep mahogany from the prime cuts he had just brought in from the morning market. Today was a special day; a shipment of succulent Wagyu arrived that afternoon, destined for a renowned chef whose reputation was as sharp as his cutlery.
