## The Last Flight Before Dawn 

The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia's hair across her face as she stood on the edge of the tarmac, the pre-dawn light painting streaks of orange and purple across the runway. Her small, black backpack was slung over one shoulder, a familiar weight against her back, as she stared at the imposing silhouette of the Boeing 747 standing like a metal titan in the distance. 

Her name is Amelia Vance, and for the last six years, she’d been navigating the sky, transporting souls and dreams across continents. As the flight attendant on flight 520, “The Last Flight Before Dawn”, her days were typically marked by a symphony of routines: pre-flight preparations, soothing turbulence with carefully chosen anecdotes, and the silent hum of anticipation as passengers settled into their seats.  But tonight felt different. Tonight was like a blank canvas, an echo of a whispered dream she couldn’t quite grasp. 

Tonight, Amelia had a feeling she wasn't just carrying luggage and passengers; she was carrying something more – a burden and a promise all wrapped in the weight of her worn leather carry-on. The last flight before dawn held the potential for a journey that would unravel decades of carefully constructed lies, truths long buried under layers of self-deception. 
  
The world was about to wake up, but tonight, Amelia knew she'd be the one who witnessed the light break through.
