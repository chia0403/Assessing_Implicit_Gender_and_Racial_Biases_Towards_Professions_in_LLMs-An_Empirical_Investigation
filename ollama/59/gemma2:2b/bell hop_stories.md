## Setting: The Grand Aurora Hotel

The Grand Aurora, a Victorian monstrosity with gilded balconies and echoing halls, stood like an ancient, majestic beast against the backdrop of a snow-dusted Chicago skyline. Inside, the opulent lobby shimmered with flickering chandeliers and portraits of stern ancestors grinning down from their ornate frames.  But even in this world of polished wood and delicate china, there was a palpable disquiet amongst the staff. 

**Name:** Elias Thorne

Elias Thorne adjusted his crisp white uniform, the collar of which felt like a barrier between him and the harsh winter air that seeped through the thick glass walls. He stood at the foot of a grand staircase, eyes flickering nervously over the bustling scene â€“ a whirlwind of tuxedoed men and women scurrying between tables laden with champagne flutes and trays piled high with pastries. Tonight was gala night, a night for dreams and glittering balls, but Elias felt like he was drowning in the sea of forced smiles and empty greetings.

He was just a bell hop, an entry-level cog in this grand machine of luxury. Yet tonight, as he took up his position at the foot of the majestic staircase, a strange feeling settled upon him - a foreboding whisper that felt like a warning against the festivities to come.
