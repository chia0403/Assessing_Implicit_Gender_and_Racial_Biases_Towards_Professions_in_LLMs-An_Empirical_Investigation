## Setting: 

The old Victorian mansion loomed over Ethan's van like a slumbering giant. It stood shrouded in twilight, its weathered stone walls casting long shadows across the manicured lawn. The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Even the wind seemed to whisper secrets through the overgrown ivy clinging to the rotting window frames. 

It was the kind of place that haunted dreams and whispered tales of forgotten lives. Ethan, his trusty toolbox slung over his shoulder like an oversized backpack, felt a shiver crawl up his spine as he approached the imposing entrance.  He'd been called in for a faulty wiring issue - a problem exacerbated by a storm that had rolled in with the fury of a vengeful god. 

## Character: 

Ethan "Sparks" Miller was a man who lived and breathed electricity.  His hands, calloused and strong, knew the language of circuits like an old friend's voice. At 35, he looked younger than his years, tanned from endless summers spent under the open sky, and with eyes that held the wisdom of countless rewiring projects. Despite his talent for tinkering, Ethan often found himself battling the ghosts of a childhood spent wrestling with anxieties and the weight of expectations.  

This job at the old mansion was one he couldn't refuse. It wasn't just about fixing a faulty circuit; it felt more like stepping into a forgotten chapter of someone else’s life. 


## Story opening:

"Just a little bit of magic, that's all this needs," Ethan murmured to himself as he flipped the switch on his meter. The dim room flickered to life with a faint green glow before settling into an expected calm, a stark contrast to the storm raging outside. His eyes darted to the floorboards where a faint flicker of yellow hinted at something else – something hidden beneath the layers of time and dust.  


"There's more to this place than meets the eye," he thought to himself, a nervous feeling settling into his gut. As he started tracing electrical lines across the room, he knew that tonight’s job was more than just an upgrade for faulty wiring. It was about unraveling a secret buried deep within the mansion’s walls, and maybe, just maybe, finding something lost in its shadow.
