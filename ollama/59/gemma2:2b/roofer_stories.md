The wind whipped against Elias Thorne's worn Stetson, tearing at his overalls as he surveyed the sprawling house.  Its weathered clapboard walls stood defiant against the encroaching storm, but even their stubbornness couldn't quite match the gale force howling around them. Elias ran a calloused hand through his thinning brown hair, the smell of sawdust and tar clinging to it like a second skin. He was a roofer by trade, a builder by heart, and yet tonight, he felt more out of place than usual. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the valley below, painting the entire landscape in hues of orange and purple.  A stark contrast to the bleak grey sky above. Elias pulled his heavy coat closer around himself as he took another drag from his cigarette, feeling the chill seep into his bones. This job was different. Not just a leaky roof or a storm-tossed chimney, but an ancient house, whispered to be haunted by something more than just wind and rain.  Something that lingered in the corners, like a ghost you couldn't quite touch.
