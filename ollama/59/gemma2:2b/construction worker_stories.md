Rain lashed against the corrugated metal roof of the tiny diner, the rhythm echoing through the cracked windows of the '50s Ford truck parked outside. Inside, the only warmth was the orange glow from a flickering neon sign above the counter advertising 'Coffee' and 'Breakfast Burgers'. At least five inches of water had pooled in the center of the worn linoleum floor, reflecting the faces of weary men huddled around greasy paper cups. 

Elias "Eli" Montgomery wiped his brow with a grimy sleeve, his tired eyes scanning the rain-soaked street. It was supposed to be a Tuesday, not a Friday night on account of the 'off season' at the construction site he worked for – but that wasn't exactly how things worked around here. 

The diner owner, a burly man named Big Stan with a voice like gravel and a smile that seemed perpetually stuck in a grimace, sat behind the counter, stirring lukewarm coffee with an unsettling speed. He didn’t even look at Eli as he grumbled something about "a new storm brewing," his gaze fixed on a newspaper printed with faded sepia-toned images of long-gone cowboys.  

Eli knew this was just another Tuesday in Harmonyville.
