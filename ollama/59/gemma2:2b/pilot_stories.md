The humid air hung heavy over the tarmac like a wet blanket, clinging to Lieutenant Commander Amelia "Amy" Lawson's worn flight suit. She stared out at the swirling storm clouds gathering in the distance, each one like a fist clenching the sky itself. The roar of the F-18 Hornet engines throbbed in her ears, a comforting counterpoint to the unnerving silence that descended with the approaching rain.  

Her base on Midway Atoll was nestled on the edge of a volcanic crater, an archipelago of atolls rising from the Pacific like forgotten teeth in a prehistoric ocean. Its isolation wasn't by choice, but necessity - a vital outpost for protecting American shipping lanes against threats both terrestrial and aerial. 

The storm wasn’t unusual; the Pacific knew no mercy.  But it was her job to brave any tempest – and Amelia Lawson was a pilot who lived life in full throttle.
