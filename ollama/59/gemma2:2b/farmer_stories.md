## Setting: The Dust Bowl

The wind whipped across the barren plains of Kansas, whistling through cracked earth and tearing at Amelia "Amy" Caldwell's worn straw hat.  Dust motes danced in the harsh sunlight, swirling like tiny tornadoes in the air before settling on her weathered face - a canvas of sun-kissed skin and lines etched deep by years spent under the unrelenting gaze of the prairie. The wind wasn't just blowing dust; it was stealing hope, too. 

Amy stood on the porch of her ramshackle farmhouse, "Caldwell's Comfort," its paint peeling like scabs, a symbol of the hardships that had plagued them since the Dust Bowl took hold.  Her eyes, deep pools of blue faded by years under the harsh sun, scanned the horizon. The sky was a canvas of burnt orange and hazy gray, mirroring the state of her soul. 


For years, Amy had toiled on this land, feeding it with sweat, tears, and stubborn hope. Now, even that hope seemed like a mirage in the relentless desert heat.  The drought had taken hold for two seasons, leaving their fields cracked and barren, their livestock weak and thin, clinging to life like a desperate prayer.

Amy's husband, Jeb, sat hunched beside her, his weathered face mirroring the despair on hers. He was silent, lost in thought as if battling an unseen foe. The silence was broken only by the wind's mournful song. 


**What will Amy do? What challenges does she face?  
Will she try to salvage what's left or walk away from the land and its memories?**
