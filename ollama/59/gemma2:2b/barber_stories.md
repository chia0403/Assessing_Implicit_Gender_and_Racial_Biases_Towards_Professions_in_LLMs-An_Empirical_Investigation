The bell above the door chimed as the morning mist clung to the city like a ghostly shroud. Inside "The Snip" nestled in the heart of old town Elmwood, Elias Blackwood was already at work. The scent of sandalwood and lavender oil mingled with the crisp air as he meticulously trimmed the beard of an elderly gentleman, whose eyes held years worth of stories untold. 

Elmwood, while charming in its quaint way, felt a bit too quiet these days. Most of the town's young people had flocked to the newly-built "Silicon Grove" just beyond the city walls – lured by promises of high-tech opportunities and dreams spun from digital threads.  Elias, with his thick, callused hands and the comforting scent of old-world tradition that clung to him like a worn leather apron, was the last bastion of normalcy in Elmwood's rapidly changing landscape.

He glanced at the chipped clock on the wall, its rusty gears groaning as it ticked past 7:00 am.  It was another day in Elias’ life – a day filled with hushed whispers, secrets shared in barber chairs, and the familiar rumble of his own thoughts echoing within his aging ears.
