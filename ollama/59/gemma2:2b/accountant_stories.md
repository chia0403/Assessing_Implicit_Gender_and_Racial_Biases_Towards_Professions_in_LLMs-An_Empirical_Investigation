Rain lashed against the windows of Edward "Eddie" Caldwell's small office, blurring the already dismal cityscape outside into a watercolour wash of gray.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and old paper, the only sounds besides the insistent drumming of rain being the ticking of his grandfather clock, its hands frozen at precisely 3:15 PM. Eddie ran a hand through his thinning hair, the grey strands mirroring the despair settling in his chest.

For three years, Eddie had poured his life into balancing the accounts for Caldwell & Sons Enterprises, a once-thriving family business now clinging to life on the edge of bankruptcy.  Every morning, he meticulously entered figures, every night, he battled with mounting debts and dwindling profits, each day an agonizingly familiar dance with failure. 

A sudden crackle from his phone jolted him out of his thoughts. Mrs. Caldwell’s voice, usually calm and reassuring, was now laced with a frantic edge. "Eddie," she said through the static, "It's...it's happening."  His heart jumped. He knew what “it” meant; the news, the inevitable fall from grace that had been steadily consuming them for weeks, had finally caught up.
