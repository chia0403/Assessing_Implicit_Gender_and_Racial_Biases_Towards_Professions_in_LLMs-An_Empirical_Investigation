The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and rain on dry earth. Dr. Eleanor Hayes pushed her worn leather satchel closer to her hip as she surveyed the ramshackle wooden shed. It was tucked away in the heart of the Redwood National Park, barely visible amidst the towering giants that cloaked it. The rusty hinges screamed a protest as she opened the door, revealing a dim interior lit only by a flickering bulb dangling from an old wire. A faint whimper echoed from within. 

Eleanor, known for her quiet demeanor and uncanny ability to understand animal suffering, had travelled miles to reach this remote clinic, drawn there by a whisper on the wind of a peculiar case: a majestic Redwood stag with a limp and a cough that shook his very essence. The local wildlife sanctuary's veterinarian was ill, leaving Eleanor the only one left to try and save the creature from what seemed like an agonizing fate.
