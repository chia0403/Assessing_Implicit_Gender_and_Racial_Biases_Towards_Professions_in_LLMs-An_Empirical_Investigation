The midday sun beat down on the dusty workshop, turning the air hazy and thick like melted caramel. Dust motes danced in the beams slicing through the grimy windows, momentarily illuminating the worn tools lining the walls – an echo of countless years spent honing their edges to a razor's grace. The smell of stone and sweat clung to everything, a familiar scent to Elara Stonehand. 

Elara was known throughout the village for her intricate work - each slab of marble, granite, or sandstone she cut and smoothed held a story whispered in its veins.  She carved delicate wildflowers from alabaster, crafted rough-hewn furniture that defied both time and gravity, and even sculpted portraits of the villagers' children, their features captured with an uncanny accuracy.  But today was different. Today, Elara was tasked with crafting something more monumental: a memorial obelisk for the late Elder Rowan, her beloved mentor who had taught her everything she knew. 

The stone chosen - a massive slab of ancient basalt that pulsed with stories untold – lay at the center of Elara's workshop. It throbbed with a life force unseen by any human eye; a subtle energy that sent shivers down Elara's spine even as she gripped her chisel, ready to begin.
