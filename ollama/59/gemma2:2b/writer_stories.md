A worn railing groaned beneath her weight, sending a shiver down her spine despite the stifling heat of July's embrace.  Her fingers, stained with ink from countless discarded drafts, gripped the edge of the worn wooden plank. 

The setting sun bled into the ocean, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and violet - an aesthetic Amelia had tried to emulate in her latest novel, "Crimson Tide." But there was a stark difference between the fictional romance she'd conjured and the cold reality that stared back at her on the lonely pier. She closed her eyes briefly, breathing in the salty breeze and letting out a sigh.

The weight of unfinished sentences pressed down on her, mirroring the heavy, suffocating atmosphere that clung to Saltwind like a shroud.
