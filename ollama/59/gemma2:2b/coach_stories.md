The humid Florida air clung to Elara Thorne like an unwelcome guest. The cracked asphalt of the Astro Turf field shimmered under the relentless sun, reflecting back at her in distorted waves. She watched as her star player, 15-year-old Miguel Diaz, struggled to land a perfect serve, his frustration evident in the way he yanked his shoulder and let out a groan that echoed across the empty field. Elara's heart clenched with a familiar mix of sympathy and determination. 

Miguel was an ambitious, talented boy, a prodigy on the court, but prone to bouts of self-doubt that threatened to derail him like an uncharged volley. Elara knew this better than anyone. She had coached Miguel since he was just a scrawny eight-year-old, building his confidence brick by brick, shot by shot, match by match. 

This year, however, things felt different. The pressure of being the youngest player ever to be drafted into the national academy for competitive tennis, combined with the fear of failing under the scrutiny of her esteemed mentor and coach, was taking its toll.  Tonight's tournament, Elara's final test before Miguel could enter the prestigious Academy, seemed to hang in the balance like a wilting daisy caught in a hurricane.
