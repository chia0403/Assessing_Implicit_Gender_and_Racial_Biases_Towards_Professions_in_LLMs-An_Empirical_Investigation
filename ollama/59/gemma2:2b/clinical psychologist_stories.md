The rain hammered against the warped windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Hawthorne's office, mimicking the staccato rhythm of her thoughts. Outside, the world seemed to be dissolving into grey;  just like the patients that filled her days with sorrow and struggle. It was one of those afternoons where the city sighed its weary breath into a perpetual drizzle, echoing the disquiet she felt swirling within. 

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to soothe the tension in her shoulders. As much as she tried to shield herself from the world’s turmoil, it inevitably seeped through the cracks in her carefully constructed façade of calm.  Her mind drifted back to her latest case: young Daniel, whose family had fallen apart under the weight of a father's sudden departure and his estranged mother's suffocating grief. The weight of their despair, heavier than Amelia's own heart, pressed down on her as she sat by her desk, a mountain of paperwork towering like a silent judge. 

The setting was small but cozy: a modest space in the vibrant yet chaotic city of New Orleans, nestled between a bustling jazz bar and a vintage bookstore. Amelia's office, with its worn-out armchair, overflowing bookshelf, and faded floral wallpaper, seemed to hold the weight of countless stories, both whispered and unspoken. But tonight, she felt trapped within the confines of this sanctuary, fighting an invisible storm in the silence of the rain.
