The aroma of sugar-drenched cinnamon rolls clung to the air like a comforting fog. It wasn't exactly the most sophisticated scent you'd find at a cafe, but for seven-year-old Evelyn Foster, it was pure magic.  She sat in the corner, perched on her specially designed booster seat, watching Mrs. Periwinkle expertly sculpt fluffy peaks of frosting with an almost religious fervor. 

Evelyn wasn't just helping set up the morning routine at Mrs. Periwinkle's daycare; she was actually part of it. Evelyn had been adopted by Mrs. Periwinkle and her husband a year ago, after years in foster care.  The house was a whirlwind of tiny hands, boundless energy, and an abundance of messy joy. The world felt brighter here than anywhere else. 

Today was especially special – it was Mrs. Periwinkle’s first visit to the local bakery for their weekly delivery of fresh goodies. Evelyn clutched her worn-out notebook in anticipation. Today's drawing theme, as per their usual ritual, was "Things You Love About Our Daycare."  Each day, Evelyn would fill her notebook with intricate sketches, capturing the essence of each child’s personality. 
 
Evelyn had a special connection to Mrs. Periwinkle; she saw something in young Evelyn that no one else did. Mrs. Periwinkle wasn't just caring for kids; she was nurturing dreams and fostering confidence, creating a space where every little voice mattered.  And this morning, as Mrs. Periwinkle set the last glass of milk on the counter before heading out, Evelyn knew – this day was going to be unforgettable.
