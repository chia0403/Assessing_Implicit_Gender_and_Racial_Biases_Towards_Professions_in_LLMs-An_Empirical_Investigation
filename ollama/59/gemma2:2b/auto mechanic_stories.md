The air hung thick with oil smoke and grease fumes, each smell a familiar comfort to Felix "Fix-It" Farron. He wiped his brow, sweat mingling with the grime on his already weathered face. His workshop, a ramshackle haven of metal and machinery under a faded blue awning, hummed with life – both mechanical and living. Just beyond the rusted toolbox by his workbench lay the source of all this activity: Maya's '67 Mustang, its chrome gleaming like a promise in the midday sun.  She wasn't just anyone; Maya was his neighbor, his confidante, the daughter whose engine woes had brought him back to his beloved craft. 

The setting was small-town Americana, nestled amongst rolling hills and quiet farmland. The only sounds were the low hum of the shop's fan, the hiss of air escaping a tire, and the occasional rustle of leaves in the wind. It felt like time itself had slowed down here, each day a gentle rhythm of work and camaraderie. But today, a knot of unease tightened in Felix’s chest as he glanced at Maya's Mustang - it needed more than just oil; it seemed to be screaming for help, its purr replaced by a cough that threatened to turn into a full-blown groan.
