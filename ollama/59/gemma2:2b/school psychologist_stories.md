## Story Opening 

Rain lashed against the windows of the counseling center like tiny hammers against a tin roof.  Inside, Dr. Eleanor Thorne stared out at the storm, her coffee growing cold on the worn oak table beside her. A heavy sigh escaped her lips. It wasn't just the weather; it was the way everything felt off. The school year had barely started and the cases already piled up like abandoned luggage by the baggage carousel, each one a silent cry for help. 

Eleanor Thorne, School Psychologist at Oakwood Middle School, was used to the storm of emotions that washed over students after a particularly rough year. But this year, something felt different, darker even. The air in the counseling center seemed thick and suffocating. She ran her hands through her already frizzy brown hair, feeling a knot of anxiety tighten in her chest.  She needed something to break the silence before it engulfed her completely. 

**Setting:** Oakwood Middle School is nestled amidst the leafy streets of Maple Grove, a town where time seems to stand still despite its bustling suburban life. The school itself is a mix of traditional and modern architecture – brick facades juxtaposed with sleek metal accents – a reflection of its own ever-changing student body. 


**Main Character:** Dr. Eleanor Thorne
