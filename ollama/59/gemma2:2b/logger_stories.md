The morning mist clung to Evergreen Bay like a lover's embrace, shrouding the towering pines in an ethereal veil of gray.  A chill wind whistled through the ancient trees, rattling their skeletal limbs as if trying to shake loose secrets from their bark-covered souls. The air smelled of pine needles and damp earth, familiar scents to young Elias Thorne, who was known amongst his fellow loggers as "Little Axe." 

Elias, barely a man at twenty years old, stood on the edge of the forest's edge, surveying the work ahead.  His grandfather had passed down the responsibility for their family logging operation to him, and with each sunrise brought a growing unease in Elias' gut. The whispers were persistent - about the woods holding their own truths, of ancient spirits awakened by his hands that dared to harvest them. He brushed off the superstitious tales as idle ramblings of old-timers, but a seed of fear had begun to sprout within him. 


**Setting:** A remote logging camp nestled deep in the heart of the Pacific Northwest's evergreen forests.
