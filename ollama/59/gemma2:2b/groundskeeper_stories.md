But now, the manor was shrouded in silence, its grandeur eclipsed by neglect. The grand oak door remained perpetually creaking shut, and dust clung to the portraits of forgotten ancestors lining the halls. It seemed as if the very heartbeat of Oakwood Manor had slowed to a mournful drumbeat, mirroring El's own weary spirit.
