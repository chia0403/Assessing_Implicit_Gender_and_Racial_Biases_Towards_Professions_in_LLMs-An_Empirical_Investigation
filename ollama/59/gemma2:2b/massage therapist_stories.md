The scent of eucalyptus and lavender hung heavy in the air as Elara adjusted her worn blue robes. Sunlight streamed through the skylights of 'Serenity Sanctuary,' casting shimmering squares across the stone floor of her treatment room. Outside, the bustling city noises were muffled by the soft, rhythmic thrum of the ancient Tibetan singing bowls she used for pre-treatment meditation. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the Himalayan cedar tree swaying in a corner, its scent mingling with the calming lavender.  

Elara was at home amongst this serene atmosphere. In her hands, a soothing balm was already warming on the table awaiting Amelia's arrival. She hadnâ€™t met Amelia yet, but she had been called for an urgent massage. The city was known for its frenetic pace, and Elara's calming presence seemed to be a beacon in the midst of the chaos.  Amelia, with her frantic energy and tight shoulders, needed her.
