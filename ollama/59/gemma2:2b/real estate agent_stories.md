The humid Florida air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Evelyn Hayes like a damp blanket as she stepped off her beat-up truck. The late afternoon sun hammered down on the red brick facade of Mrs. Hawthorne's cottage, casting long, distorted shadows across the overgrown lawn. A chorus of cicadas buzzed in the oppressive heat, mirroring the relentless ticking of the tiny grandfather clock in Evelyn’s office back in Miami. 

Evelyn had been driving for over six hours, each mile a testament to her stubborn determination – and her mounting frustration.  This was not how she imagined starting her week. Mrs. Hawthorne's estate on this sleepy street corner in Key West was supposed to be a slam dunk, a breeze of an opportunity after last month's disastrously slow sales period. Instead, it felt more like navigating a swamp, tangled vines obscuring the path and the silence amplifying every creak in the old house. 

Evelyn sighed, adjusting her turquoise blouse and pulling out her weathered notepad. The name “Mrs. Hawthorne” was scrawled across the page, faded and almost disappearing into the humid air.  She'd been hoping this would be different. This time, she could actually see a glimmer of hope in the eyes of the potential buyer – a young couple named Liam and Sarah, who dreamed of turning this dilapidated house into their dream home, but lacked experience navigating the treacherous terrain of homeownership in such an historic, yet unpredictable, location.
