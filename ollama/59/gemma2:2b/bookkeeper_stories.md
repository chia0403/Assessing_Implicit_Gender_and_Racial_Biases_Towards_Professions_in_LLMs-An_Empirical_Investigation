Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Mr. Fitzwilliam's office, blurring the city lights into an impressionistic dance of colour.  Eleanor Fitzwilliam sat hunched over her ledger, her brow furrowed as she wrestled with a particularly stubborn row of debits and credits. The rhythmic tap-tap of her pen on the worn leather cover was almost drowned out by the insistent drumming of the storm. It was 3:15 am – the usual time for Mrs. Peabody to call in for an emergency reconciliation, but tonight, even Mrs. Peabody’s calls seemed to be swallowed by the storm's fury.  A shiver danced up Eleanor’s spine. Even the scent of Earl Grey tea that usually permeated her office felt heavy with the dampness and unease that clung to the night like a shroud. 

Eleanor Fitzwilliam, a woman of meticulous precision and unflinching logic, found herself unnerved tonight. The storm felt...personal. A sense of dread settled like lead in her stomach. The flickering gaslight cast long, distorted shadows across her desk, making it seem as if the very room was breathing with unseen life.  As she continued to struggle through the last few entries on her ledger, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was profoundly wrong.
