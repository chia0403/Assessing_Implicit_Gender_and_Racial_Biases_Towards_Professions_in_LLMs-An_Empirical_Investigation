Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office like an orchestra playing for a grieving symphony.  The scent of rain-soaked earth and old books hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to her after years spent in this quiet corner of the city.  Eleanor, with her unruly auburn hair escaping its neat bun and tired eyes behind spectacles, looked at the door, a familiar knot forming in her stomach as she waited for her next appointment. 

She was a counseling psychologist, a rare breed these days who navigated the treacherous waters of human emotion without losing her sense of self-preservation. Her patients came with their burdens: anxieties about job security, broken relationships, the ever-present shadow of societal expectations. But Eleanor found solace in helping them untangle their thoughts like threads on a tapestry. 

Tonight's patient, Mr. Davis, was different. He carried a quiet dread that felt heavier than usual, his shoulders slumped under a storm of unspoken fears.  He was just another client, another voice in the symphony of lives playing out behind her closed doors.  But tonight, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was deeply wrong. It pulsed beneath the surface like a storm hidden in a calm sea.
