The scent of acetone and citrus hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Evelyn "Evie" Pierce. Her small shop, "Sugar & Nails," nestled between a vintage bookstore and a bustling bakery, hummed with the hushed buzz of its afternoon clientele. Outside, a summer storm brewed, unleashing sheets of rain on the quaint town of Willow Creek.  Inside, Evie worked her magic with nimble fingers and an infectious smile. Each customer’s arrival was like a small spark igniting a warmth within her – the promise of a little escape from the everyday grind, the gentle ritual of self-care. 

Evie's current client, Ms. Beatrice Hawthorne, a woman who looked as though she had stepped out of a Victorian portrait with her silver hair and delicate floral prints, sat expectantly in the plush velvet armchair.  As always, Evie started with a warm, comforting hand massage while she chatted about the weather, gossip, and the latest mystery novel Ms. Hawthorne was devouring. 

But tonight, something felt different. The storm's intensity seemed to mirror the growing unease settling over Evie like a thick fog. As she looked at Beatrice’s steady gaze, a flicker of apprehension passed between them. It was just nails – or so she thought. Something about Beatrice’s face held a story she wasn’t yet privy to.  A story that whispered secrets and threatened to unravel the very fabric of Willow Creek's peace.
