The relentless drone of the engine was Calloway "Cal" Thompson's constant companion, a lullaby he learned to hum along to decades ago on the road.  He ran his hand over the chipped paint of his rig, 'The Salty Dog', a relic of countless miles and even more memories. It wasn't much to look at, just a faded blue steel skeleton with a dented chrome grill and a rusty sun visor that had seen its fair share of sunsets. The setting sun bled orange across the endless Nevada desert as Cal crossed the border into California, leaving the familiar aches of home on the dusty highways of Arizona.  This stretch of Route 66 was known for its harsh beauty, a kaleidoscope of red rock formations and shimmering heat waves dancing in the air. 

Cal's journey was fueled by more than just duty.  He was delivering a shipment of rare antique clocks, their intricate gears and delicate faces whispering tales from forgotten eras. The clocks, each one imbued with a history as rich and complex as the stories he himself had accumulated on his travels, were destined for a grand auction in San Francisco, where money would be traded for time, a currency Cal felt strangely familiar with.
