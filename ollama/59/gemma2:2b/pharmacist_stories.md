The air hung thick with the smell of lavender and antiseptic in the heart of Willow Creek Pharmacy. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, her white coat dusted with powdered sugar from the afternoon’s batch of cough syrups, glanced at the clock. 6:32 pm. The last hour before closing was a blur of calming chamomile tea for Mrs. Peterson's nerves, dispensing generic painkillers to Mr. Henderson's aching joints, and restocking the shelves with "Miracle" vitamins that promised everything from increased energy to improved hair growth. 

But tonight felt different. A chill wind whistled through the open window, carrying the scent of woodsmoke that reminded Amy of her childhood summers spent by the fire pit in her grandmother’s cabin. The shadows seemed longer tonight, casting an almost ominous feeling over the normally cozy space.  The familiar hum of the fridge and the gentle whir of the cash register felt amplified, as if they were echoing with a hidden rhythm. 

Her eyes fell on a single letter nestled amongst the stacks of prescription forms - a stark white envelope addressed in a bold, looping script to "Amelia Cartwright."  A knot formed in her stomach. This wasn't an ordinary prescription refill, not even a friendly reminder about Mr. Thompson’s cholesterol medication. It was something bigger, something… ominous.
