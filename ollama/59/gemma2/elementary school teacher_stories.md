The scent of fresh crayons and dusty books hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that Eleanor Beatrice Willowcroft cherished almost as much as she loved her students. Her classroom, Room 207 at Maplewood Elementary, was a vibrant tapestry of hand-drawn artwork adorning every inch of wall space, alphabet posters meticulously color-coded, and miniature plastic dinosaurs scattered amongst building blocks on the floor. It was chaos, in the most delightful way possible. Eleanor surveyed the scene with a contented smile, her heart swelling with the familiar pre-lesson buzz. 

It was a Tuesday morning, the day they held their "Show and Tell" sessions, and Eleanor knew this one would be particularly exciting.  Little Lily had promised to bring in her grandmother's antique dollhouse, its intricate details rumored to be whispered secrets from another era. A wave of anticipation rippled through Eleanor, a reminder of why she wouldnâ€™t trade teaching second grade for anything in the world.
