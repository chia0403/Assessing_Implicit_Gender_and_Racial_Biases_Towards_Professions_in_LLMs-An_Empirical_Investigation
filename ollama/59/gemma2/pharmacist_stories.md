The bell above the door chimed softly as Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles and peered over the counter. Outside, rain lashed against the frosted glass windowpanes of "Hawthorne's Apothecary," blurring the vibrant autumn foliage into an impressionist painting of reds and golds. The aroma of dried lavender and peppermint hung in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the brewing storm. Eleanor, with her silver braid neatly coiled around her head and a smile that crinkled the corners of her eyes, surveyed the mostly empty shop.  

It wasn't usually this quiet on a Friday afternoon. Perhaps the impending tempest had kept people indoors. Or maybe it was something else entirely. A prickle of unease ran down Eleanor's spine, a sensation she couldn't quite place. She chalked it up to the unusual stillness and returned to arranging the jars of colorful tinctures lining the shelves behind her.  


But then the bell chimed again, sharper this time, jolting Eleanor from her thoughts. A figure, shrouded in a long, dark coat, stepped into the warm glow of the apothecary.
