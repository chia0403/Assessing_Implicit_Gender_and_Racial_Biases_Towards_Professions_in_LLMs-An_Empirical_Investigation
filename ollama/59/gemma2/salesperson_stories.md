The neon buzz of the "Open 24 Hours" sign cast a sickly green glow across Eleanor Vance's weary face as she surveyed the near-empty electronics store. Rain lashed against the glass doors, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Another Saturday night shift, another mountain of unsold gadgets staring back at her like accusing eyes. A lonely figure in a world of shiny promises, she wished for the tenth time that she'd pursued her dream of writing instead of falling into this dead-end job. 


The setting was "Tech Haven," a discount electronics store tucked away on a side street in a forgotten corner of Detroit. The interior was a cacophony of flickering screens, buzzing appliances, and dusty boxes stacked haphazardly around the worn linoleum floor. Posters advertising "Deals You Can't Refuse!" hung limply from the walls, their once vibrant colors faded by neglect and the greasy residue of countless customer hands.  The air hung thick with the smell of burnt popcorn â€“ a remnant of a long-forgotten movie night promotion that had ended in disaster.
