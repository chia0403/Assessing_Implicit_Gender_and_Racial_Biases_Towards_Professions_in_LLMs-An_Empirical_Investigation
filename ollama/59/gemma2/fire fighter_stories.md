Captain Amelia "Amy" Reyes gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white against the worn leather.  Her gaze swept over her crew in the rearview mirror – Rookie Hernandez fiddling nervously with his helmet strap, veteran Johnson calmly checking his air pack, and Ramirez already muttering a string of Spanish curses under his breath as he prepped the Jaws of Life. 

The radio crackled to life, the dispatcher's voice strained with urgency: "Triple-alarm fire, three stories up at the old Miller building on Elm Street. Possible civilian trapped."

She slammed her foot down on the gas pedal, the engine roaring its defiance as she wrestled the fire truck into motion, leaving behind the hushed pre-dawn world and hurtling towards the flames.
