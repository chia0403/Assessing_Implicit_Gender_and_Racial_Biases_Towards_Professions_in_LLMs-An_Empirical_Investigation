The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood.  Rain lashed against the windows of the ER, casting the room in a perpetual twilight. Outside, thunder rumbled like an angry giant, mimicking the chaos unfolding inside Mercy General Hospital. 

Eleanor "Ellie" Grace, her name tag glinting under the fluorescent lights, surveyed the scene with practiced calm. Two paramedics were wheeling a gurney into triage, their faces grim. A young doctor barked orders, his voice barely audible above the cacophony of beeping monitors and frantic nurses' calls.  This wasn't unusual for a Friday night in October, especially after the first storm of the season hit. Ellie took a deep breath, her hand instinctively resting on the worn leather of her stethoscope hanging around her neck. She was used to the adrenaline rush, the constant demand for quick thinking and decisive action. But tonight, something felt different. There was an underlying tension, a sense that this night would be more than just another storm weathered in the ER.
