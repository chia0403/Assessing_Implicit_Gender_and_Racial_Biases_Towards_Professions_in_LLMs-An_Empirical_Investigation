The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and exhaust fumes.  Cicadas chirped their monotonous song, punctuated by the distant rumble of passing trucks on Peachtree Street. Inside the Grand Magnolia Hotel, the air conditioning hummed, a soothing counterpoint to the sweltering summer heat. 

Elias "Eli" Montgomery wiped beads of sweat from his brow as he maneuvered a trolley piled high with luggage through the bustling lobby. He adjusted the red cap perched atop his head, its brass bell glinting under the ornate chandeliers hanging like crystal tears from the vaulted ceiling. Eli had worked at the Grand Magnolia for five years, ever since he'd moved to Atlanta after graduating high school. It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills and kept him close enough to his grandmother in Decatur. Besides, there was a certain charm to the old place, with its faded grandeur and stories whispered in hushed tones by the long-time staff.  Eli had learned to decipher those whispers, to see past the polished marble floors and velvet curtains and glimpse the ghosts of forgotten romances and scandalous secrets that lingered within the walls.

Today, however, Eli wasn't interested in ghost stories. He was focused on the man before him, a tall, sharply dressed figure with an air of impatience that seemed to crackle around him like static electricity. The man held a worn leather suitcase, its edges frayed and the brass lock tarnished.  Eli felt a prickle of unease as he met the stranger's piercing gaze. Something about this guest, something in his narrowed eyes and tightly pursed lips, told Eli that this was no ordinary arrival.
