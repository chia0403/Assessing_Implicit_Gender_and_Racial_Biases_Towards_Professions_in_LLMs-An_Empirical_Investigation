The sun bled across the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised plum and molten gold as Jasper Jedediah Colt surveyed his spread. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling around the weathered fence posts like miniature tornadoes. A hawk circled lazily above, its shadow flitting over the skeletal remains of a tumbleweed. The air held the scent of sagebrush and impending rain - always an unsettling combination on the plains.

Jasper, a man as weathered and worn as the landscape itself, spat tobacco juice into a rusted tin can beside his battered pickup truck.  His calloused hands rested on the steering wheel, knuckles white with tension. A month of relentless drought had stretched his already thin patience to its breaking point. The cattle were dwindling, the riverbed was cracked and dusty, and the sky offered no promise of relief. This wasn't just a bad year - this was an existential crisis for Colt Ranch.
