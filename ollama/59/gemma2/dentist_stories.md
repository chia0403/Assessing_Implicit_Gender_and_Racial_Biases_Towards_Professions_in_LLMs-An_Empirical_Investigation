The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and nervous anticipation in Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Harding’s office.  Sunlight streamed through the frosted glass window, casting squares of warmth across the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the familiar sounds of bustling Elm Street - honking cars, chattering pedestrians, a stray dog barking - seemed miles away. Inside, it was just Evelyn, her meticulously organized dental tools laid out on a tray, and the silence that stretched between her and the next patient. 


Evelyn tapped her pen against her clipboard, her gaze flitting to the clock on the wall. She hated this waiting period. It always amplified the quiet hum of anxiety that seemed to permeate the small space.  She glanced at the appointment card: “John Smith,” it read in bold letters. A shiver ran down her spine. John Smith was notoriously afraid of dentists, a fact she knew from his frantic phone calls scheduling and rescheduling his appointments over the past year. 


Evelyn straightened her starched white coat, a faint smile playing on her lips. She wasn’t sure what to expect from John, but she was determined to make this visit as painless – both literally and metaphorically – as possible.
