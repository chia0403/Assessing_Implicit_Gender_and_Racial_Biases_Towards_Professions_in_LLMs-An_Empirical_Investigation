The stale air hung heavy in the Grand Aurora Theatre, thick with the scent of popcorn gone rancid and forgotten dreams. Dust motes danced in the slivers of moonlight that pierced through the grimy skylights, illuminating Agnes Pearlbottom as she pushed her mop across the cavernous stage. The once-vibrant velvet curtains were faded and dusty, their crimson hue muted by years of neglect.  The ornate gold trim along the balconies chipped and cracked, whispering tales of a bygone era when this theatre had been a beacon of laughter and light. Now, it stood silent, a monument to lost grandeur, under the watchful eyes of Agnes, its faithful caretaker. 


She hummed softly to herself, a tune from one of the forgotten musicals that once graced this stage, her mop creating rhythmic swishing sounds against the worn wooden floorboards. The silence was broken only by the occasional creak of the aged structure and the rustle of rats in the dusty rafters above. Agnes knew every nook and cranny of this place, every flickering light bulb and cobweb-laden corner. It was more than just her job; it was a responsibility, a way to keep a piece of history alive, even if only for her.
