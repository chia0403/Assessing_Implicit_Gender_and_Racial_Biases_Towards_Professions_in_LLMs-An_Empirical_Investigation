The humid Atlanta air clung to  Finnian "Finn" McArthur like a wet wool blanket as he wrestled the frayed extension cord through the overgrown tangle of kudzu that choked the side porch of the dilapidated Victorian mansion. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the peeling paint and warped wood siding. The scent of mildew and decay hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the buzzing drone of cicadas. Finn grimaced â€“ this wasn't exactly how he'd envisioned spending his Saturday morning.

This sprawling old house, once a beacon of Southern elegance, now stood as a decaying testament to faded grandeur. Its windows were boarded shut, its roof sagged precariously, and the porch creaked ominously with every step Finn took. He had been hired by the eccentric Mrs. Blackwood, who claimed her ancestor's spirit haunted the place and needed "a jolt of electricity" to calm it. 

Finn, a practical man of logic, scoffed at such claims. He knew his job was simple: rewire the aging electrical system and get this house back in working order. But as he stood on that creaking porch, bathed in the eerie stillness of the morning light, a prickle of unease ran down his spine. This wasn't just another job; it felt different.
