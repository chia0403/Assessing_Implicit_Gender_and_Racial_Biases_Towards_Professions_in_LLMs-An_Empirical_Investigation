The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and acrylic. A faint thrum of Rihanna pulsed from the hidden speaker tucked behind the mirrored wall, barely audible over the rhythmic scrape of Amelia Rose Thornton's electric file against chipped crimson. 

Amelia, her hands swift and steady despite the knot of anxiety twisting in her stomach, surveyed her reflection in the mirror: perfectly manicured nails, adorned with a minimalist gold stripe, framed by an updo that showcased her vibrant turquoise earrings. The salon, "The Polished Pearl," was bustling with its usual pre-dinner rush – chattering women swapping secrets while Amelia transformed their chipped polish into wearable art. 

But tonight felt different. There was an undercurrent of tension in the air, a prickling awareness that something was off.  It started with Mr. Henderson, the regular who always ordered a simple French manicure, looking like he'd swallowed a lemon. Then Mrs. Davenport, usually bubbly and chatty, stared out the window with unreadable eyes. 

Amelia tried to dismiss it as coincidence, but as she applied a final coat of shimmering silver to Mrs. Peterson's nails, a whisper reached her: "They say the bridge is closed."  


The statement hung in the air, heavy and unsettling. Amelia knew the bridge was the only way into town – a lifeline for their small community nestled on a remote island. If it were closed... something had gone terribly wrong.
