The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and buttercream, a sweet perfume that usually soothed Amelia Rose Hawthorneâ€™s soul. Today, however, it felt suffocating. Sweat prickled her brow as she stared at the towering monstrosity before her: a four-tiered wedding cake designed to resemble a blooming rose garden. 

Amelia's tiny bakery, "Sugar & Spice," nestled in a quaint corner of Charleston, South Carolina, was usually a haven of creative calm. Sunlight streamed through the pastel-painted windows, illuminating rows of colorful sprinkles and delicately piped frosting flowers. But today, chaos reigned. A faulty air conditioner hummed a mournful tune, battling the rising heat from the ovens. The wedding cake, with its intricate sugar petals and fondant roses, threatened to melt under the oppressive humidity.  

Amelia's usually nimble fingers fumbled as she attempted to place a delicate sugar butterfly onto the top tier. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic rhythm echoing the anxious buzzing of a fly caught in a window pane. The bride was due any minute, and Amelia knew this cake, a masterpiece commissioned months ago, could make or break her reputation.
