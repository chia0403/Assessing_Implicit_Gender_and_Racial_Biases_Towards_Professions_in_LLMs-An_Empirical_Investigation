The pungent aroma of sweat and stale incense hung thick in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic thump of bass and the occasional guttural grunt emanating from the darkened studio.  A single shaft of moonlight sliced through a gap in the blinds, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid air. It landed squarely on Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather's back as she expertly executed a downward-facing dog, her lithe form outlined against the muted purple glow emanating from the disco ball hanging precariously from the ceiling. 

Tonight was different. Sera could feel it in her bones. The usual buzz of anticipation from her Tuesday night "Body Blast" class felt subdued, replaced by an unsettling quiet. Even the neon signs flashing outside - advertising everything from dubious energy drinks to discount massages - seemed to dim their usual vibrancy, casting the familiar cityscape in a melancholic haze. Sera couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.  


This wasn't just another night of pushing bodies and minds to their limits. This night feltâ€¦ heavier.
