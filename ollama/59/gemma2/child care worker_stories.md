The stale smell of disinfectant mingled with something faintly sweet, like overripe bananas, as Amelia Josephine Cartwright pushed open the door to the Sunflower Room. Sunlight streamed through the windows, illuminating a chaotic scene: blocks were scattered across the floor like fallen soldiers, crayons had melted onto the table, and a mountain of discarded paper plates threatened to topple at any moment.  

Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for another day at Tiny Miracles Daycare.  A whirlwind of sticky fingers, runny noses, and boundless energy awaited her. She loved these kids, with their infectious laughter and genuine curiosity about the world, but sometimes, just sometimes, she yearned for a quiet cup of coffee in the morning without the constant chatter of five-year-olds demanding juice boxes and glitter glue.


The setting is a brightly lit, somewhat messy daycare center called "Tiny Miracles" located in a suburban neighborhood.
