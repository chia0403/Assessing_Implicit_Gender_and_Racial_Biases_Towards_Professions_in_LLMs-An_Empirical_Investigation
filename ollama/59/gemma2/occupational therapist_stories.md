The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sterile smell of latex gloves and freshly laundered sheets. Sunlight streamed through the high windows of Amelia Beatrice Thornton's office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the quiet room. It was early morning, just before the flurry of patients began their scheduled appointments. 

Amelia, her bright blue eyes scanning a patient file, took a deep breath, savoring the moment of stillness before the day's demands kicked in. She loved her job as an occupational therapist at Lakeside Rehabilitation Center.  She thrived on helping people regain independence, watching them overcome challenges and rediscover their strengths. Today, she had a particularly intriguing case: a young man named Ethan Walker, a talented musician who had suffered a stroke that left him with limited use of his right hand, the very hand essential to playing his beloved piano. 


Amelia knew this wouldn't be an easy journey for Ethan, but she was determined to help him find new ways to express his passion and reclaim his joy.  She glanced at the framed photograph on her desk - a picture of her own mother, beaming with pride as Amelia received her occupational therapy degree years ago. Her mother had always been her biggest supporter, a constant reminder that helping others was her true calling.
