The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the cramped office where Eleanor Penelope Beaumont sat.  A faded poster depicting a smiling sunflower in a sunny field hung crookedly on the wall, providing a jarring contrast to the dull beige walls and the unyielding silence. Outside, the incessant rain hammered against the windows of Northwood Elementary School, blurring the world into an indistinct watercolor wash. 

Eleanor, with her unruly auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun and tired blue eyes framed by thick glasses, sighed as she reviewed another student file. Ten-year-old Samuel Henderson's case was particularly troubling â€“ escalating aggression towards classmates, withdrawal from social activities, nightmares that left him trembling in his sleep. It was the kind of situation that gnawed at Eleanor, a constant reminder of the invisible battles fought by children trapped in their own silent worlds. 


She pushed the file aside, leaning back in her creaky chair and rubbing her temples.  Dealing with trauma, anxiety, and the complexities of childhood was never easy. But today, the rain seemed to amplify the feeling of weariness that clung to her like a damp cloak. As the hum of the fluorescent lights continued its relentless drone, Eleanor wondered if she had enough strength left to help Samuel find his way back from the darkness.
