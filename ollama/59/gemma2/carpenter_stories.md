The air in Elias Thornewood's workshop smelled of sawdust and pine needles, a comforting aroma that clung to his calloused fingers and faded denim overalls. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness. Outside, the sleepy town of Oakhaven hummed with a Sunday morning lull. 

Elias, his forehead creased with concentration, ran a hand over the smooth surface of the half-finished chest. He'd been commissioned by Mrs. Amelia Hawthorne to build it for her granddaughter's upcoming birthday, a delicate piece inlaid with cherrywood and adorned with delicate carvings of wildflowers. Elias took pride in his work, imbuing each creation with a touch of artistry that went beyond mere carpentry. But this project felt different. It was imbued with a sense of yearning, a whispered echo of unfinished dreams.

Elias's gaze drifted to the faded photograph propped against his workbench - a younger version of himself, grinning broadly beside a woman with fiery red hair and eyes that mirrored the summer sky. He traced her face with his thumb, a bittersweet ache in his chest. It had been five years since Sarah had left Oakhaven, chasing her dreams in the bustling city far to the east. Five years since he'd promised himself he would follow. 


But the workshop had become more than just a livelihood; it had become his sanctuary, a testament to his lost love and a reminder of the life they had once shared.
