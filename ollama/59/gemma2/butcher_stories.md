The bell above the door jingled mournfully, announcing another customer to Bartholomew "Bart" Hemlock's Butcher Shop.  The scent of cured ham and fresh pork hung heavy in the air, mingling with the chill of early morning dew creeping through the open doorway. Sunlight, pale and hesitant, sliced through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. 

Bart wiped his blood-stained apron with a calloused hand, the action familiar as breathing. He leaned against the butcher block counter, its surface scarred by years of cleavers and carving knives, watching Mrs. Peabody shuffle towards him. She was a fixture in his life, as predictable as sunrise and as dependable as a good blade.  

"Morning, Mrs. P," Bart greeted her, his voice gruff but kind. "The usual?" 


The shop, nestled on the edge of Willow Creek, wasn't much to look at. Brick walls were crumbling, paint peeled like sunburnt skin, and the sign above creaked precariously in the breeze. But behind its unassuming facade, Bart Hemlock wielded more than just a cleaver; he was a master craftsman, a guardian of tradition, and perhaps, unknowingly, a thread woven into the fabric of a town teetering on the brink of something dark.
