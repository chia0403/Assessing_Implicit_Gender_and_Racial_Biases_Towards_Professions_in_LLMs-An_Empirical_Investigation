The greasy grime clung to Amelia "Amy" Reyes like a second skin. It was a badge of honor in her world – the world of busted engines, sputtering transmissions, and the sweet smell of burnt oil. Her hands, calloused and strong, rested on the hood of a beat-up Chevy Camaro, its engine purring like a dissatisfied cat beneath her touch. 

Amy's garage, "Reyes' Repairs," was tucked away in a forgotten corner of San Francisco, nestled between a boarded-up liquor store and a fading tattoo parlor. The faded blue paint peeled off the brick walls, revealing glimpses of graffiti from better days. Inside, tools hung on the walls like metal ornaments, each one meticulously sharpened and ready for action. 

She squinted at the engine, her brow furrowed in concentration. A symphony of clangs and whirs filled the air as she worked, punctuated by the rhythmic rasp of her breathing. This Camaro was a challenge – its heart had been tampered with, its wires mismatched like a drunken electrician's work. But Amy thrived on these puzzles, finding solace in the logic of mechanics, the tangible solutions to impossible problems. 


It was more than just fixing cars for Amy; it was about understanding them, respecting their intricate systems, and ultimately, bringing them back to life.
