The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thompson's head, casting a sterile glow over the cramped waiting room. A lone, forgotten magazine lay open on a chipped plastic table, its pages yellowed with age and spattered with dried bloodstains - a grim testament to the phlebotomistâ€™s work.  Amelia glanced at the clock: 8:53 am. Five minutes until her shift started, and already the room buzzed with the nervous energy of those awaiting their turn.  

She ran a gloved hand through her auburn hair, smoothing down a stray strand that had escaped its ponytail. The faint scent of antiseptic hung in the air, a familiar fragrance she usually found comforting. Today, it felt suffocating. Amelia gripped the metal armrest of her chair, her knuckles white against the cold steel. 


The waiting room door creaked open, and a young woman with trembling hands shuffled in. Her eyes darted around the room, settling on Amelia with a mixture of fear and desperation. A prickling sensation ran down Amelia's spine. It wasn't just the usual pre-shift jitters.  Something felt different today, heavier.  

The day was just beginning.
