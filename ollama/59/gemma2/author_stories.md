Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through the grime-coated windowpane, illuminating his messy desk piled high with scribbled notes, crumpled drafts, and empty coffee cups. Outside, a storm raged, mimicking the tempest brewing within Elias himself. His latest novel, a sprawling epic about a forgotten empire, lay unfinished on his desk, its pages staring back at him like accusing eyes.
