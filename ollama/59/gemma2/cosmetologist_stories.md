The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the harsh January chill that seeped through the drafty windows of "Serene Strokes," Eliza Beatrice Hawthorne's little haven of beauty nestled on Elm Street. Eliza, a woman whose fiery red curls rivalled the intensity of her emerald green eyes, expertly wielded a pair of scissors, shaping a client's unruly auburn mane into a cascading waterfall of curls.  

Outside, snow fell in fat, lazy flakes, blanketing the town of Oakhaven in a pristine white silence. Inside, however, the air crackled with a different kind of energy: the vibrant hum of conversation, the whirring of hair dryers, and the soft clinking of brushes against ceramic bowls filled with shimmering hair dyes. It was a symphony of transformation, where Eliza, with her magic touch and sharp wit, orchestrated each appointment into a masterpiece of self-expression and confidence. 


But this afternoon, something felt different. A tremor of unease, like a snowflake landing on the back of your neck, ran through Eliza's normally calm demeanor. She couldn't quite place it - perhaps it was the persistent ringing in her ears, or the way the streetlights outside flickered with an unnatural rhythm. Whatever it was, it whispered of an impending storm, one that threatened to disrupt the tranquility of Serene Strokes and plunge Oakhaven into something far more sinister than a winter blizzard.
