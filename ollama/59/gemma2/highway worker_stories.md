The sun bled across the asphalt, turning Highway 87 into a shimmering river of molten gold. Dew clung to the overgrown weeds bordering the road, glistening like scattered diamonds in the morning light. The air was thick with the scent of diesel and pine needles, a familiar perfume for Elara Bellweather. She leaned against her shovel, squinting at the horizon where the endless blue sky met the hazy green of the distant foothills. 

Elara hadn't signed up for this life â€“  highway maintenance in rural Nevada was about as glamorous as it got. But she had no other options. After her parents died in a freak accident, leaving her orphaned and burdened with debt, the highway department job offered stability, even if it meant enduring endless stretches of solitude punctuated by the roar of passing trucks. 


She hefted the shovel, the familiar weight settling comfortably in her calloused hands. Another day, another stretch of road to mend, another mile closer to wherever life was taking her next.
