The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Agnes Periwinkle's cluttered office. A mishmash of tax forms, coffee-stained receipts, and empty soda cans littered her desk, testament to another grueling season. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation - a potent perfume unique to April in Huckleberry Ridge, Minnesota.

It was day 38 of the Tax Season Inferno, and Agnes felt like she'd aged ten years already. The constant stream of worried faces, mumbled explanations about "business expenses" that involved questionable purchases at Hobby Lobby, and the ever-present threat of an IRS audit were starting to wear her down.


Agnes longed for the quiet solitude of her garden, where she could nurture her prize-winning begonias instead of battling labyrinthine tax codes. But, as always, duty called. Huckleberry Ridge depended on her - even if they did forget to tip her until the last minute.
