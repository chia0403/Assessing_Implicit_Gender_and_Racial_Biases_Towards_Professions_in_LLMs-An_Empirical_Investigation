The scent of lavender and fine linen hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eleanor Rose Hathaway like a second skin. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh were slick with rain, reflecting the dim glow of gas lamps that cast long shadows across the city. Inside her shop, "Threads of Time," however, it was always a haven of warmth and light. 

Eleanor, her hands nimble and quick, worked diligently on a gown of silk and lace.  The fabric flowed through her fingers like liquid moonlight, whispering tales of grand balls and whispered secrets. She stitched with precision, each stitch a testament to years of dedicated craft. This gown, destined for the debutante daughter of Lord Blackwood, would be her masterpiece - a symphony of color and elegance designed to launch a young woman into society.  But Eleanor's thoughts drifted beyond the shimmering fabric and intricate embroidery. A shadow lingered at the edge of her mind, a whisper of unease that she couldn't quite place.  The city held its breath tonight, waiting for something to unfold, something momentous, something...dangerous.
