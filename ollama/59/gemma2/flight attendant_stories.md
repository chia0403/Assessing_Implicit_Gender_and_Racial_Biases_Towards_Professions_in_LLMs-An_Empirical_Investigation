The stale scent of recycled air hung thick in Amelia Beatrice Nightingaleâ€™s nostrils as she maneuvered down the aisle of Flight 347, San Francisco to London.  

Amelia, or "Amy" as most passengers called her after their initial encounter with the nameplate on her crisp uniform, surveyed the cabin with practiced indifference. A baby was screaming somewhere near the back, a businessman in a navy suit tapped furiously at his laptop, and an elderly couple bickered over whose crossword puzzle had been accidentally crumpled. This was Tuesday afternoon, nothing out of the ordinary. Yet, there was a strange undercurrent to this flight, a prickling awareness that something wasn't quite right.  

Perhaps it was the way the passengers seemed unusually quiet, their faces drawn and pale, or the unsettling silence emanating from the cockpit, usually filled with chatter between pilots. Or maybe it was just the lingering scent of burnt popcorn from the malfunctioning galley oven, making everything seem a little...off. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the Pacific Ocean as the plane hurtled towards its destination, carrying within its metallic belly a collection of lives on hold, unaware that their journey was about to take an unexpected turn.
