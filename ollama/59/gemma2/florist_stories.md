The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually brought Eloise Clementine Lavender joy. Today, however, it did little to mask the damp chill seeping through the drafty old windows of Lavender's Blooms. Rain lashed against the glass panes, blurring the vibrant display of sunflowers and geraniums lining the storefront.

Eloise stood behind the counter, a tangle of auburn curls escaping from her braid as she absently rearranged a bouquet of fragrant lavender sprigs. A stray gust of wind rattled the shop door, sending a shiver down her spine. It wasn't just the weather; a sense of unease had settled over Eloise since the arrival of the mysterious new family in town just last week. 


She glanced at the worn clock on the wall. It was almost closing time, and the usual afternoon rush had been strangely absent. A lone figure huddled by the doorway, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, seemed to be staring right at her. Eloise quickly turned away, hoping she hadn't imagined it. Business in the small town of Willow Creek was rarely this slow, especially not on a Friday afternoon.


With a sigh, Eloise locked up the shop, bracing herself against the wind as she stepped out into the rain. Perhaps tomorrow would be better.
