The humid air clung to Eleanor Vance like a second skin as she squinted at the blueprint spread across her desk.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, blurring the lines of the sprawling modern design for the new City Hall complex. It was stifling in her small office, perched precariously above a bustling Havana street market. The cacophony of vendors hawking their wares and the rhythmic clang of metal from a nearby forge only served to amplify Eleanor’s mounting frustration. 

She rubbed her temples, trying to ease the tension throbbing behind her eyes. The City Hall project was proving more challenging than she'd anticipated. Not just because of the sweltering heat, but because it felt like everyone had an opinion – from the elderly council members clinging to tradition to the young activists demanding radical change.  Eleanor yearned for a simpler time, before politics and personalities intertwined with her architectural vision. 


Back then, design was about lines, angles, and creating spaces that breathed. Now, it felt more like navigating a minefield of conflicting desires and expectations. She sighed, pushing the blueprint aside and reaching for the mango juice sweating in its glass. This project demanded more than just blueprints and concrete; it required diplomacy, patience, and perhaps, a touch of magic.
