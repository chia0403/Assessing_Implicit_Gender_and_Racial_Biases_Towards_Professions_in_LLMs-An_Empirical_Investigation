The humid Georgia air hung heavy over Coach Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes as she watched her team stumble through drills. Sweat stung their eyes, frustration etched on their young faces. The sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the dusty field, reflecting off the faded blue paint of the bleachers that stood empty save for a lone hawk perched on the highest row. 

This wasn't the start Ellie had envisioned for her first season coaching the Westview Wildcats.  Recruiting hadnâ€™t been kind, and the girls seemed more interested in their phones than perfecting their footwork. They lacked the fire, the grit she knew they possessed somewhere deep within. This was a team that needed to believe in themselves before they could ever hope to win. 


Ellie wiped her brow, the sting of sweat mixing with determination. She wouldn't let them down. She wouldn't let herself down. This team, this small town, deserved a champion.
