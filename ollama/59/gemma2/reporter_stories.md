Rain hammered against Amelia Beatrice “Amy” Hawthorne’s trench coat, each drop exploding into a miniature geyser on the slick cobblestone streets. The aroma of burnt sugar and damp earth hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid scent of exhaust from the passing trams.  Gaslights flickered erratically, casting long, dancing shadows that stretched and contorted across the narrow alleys of New Albion's Lower Quarter. Amy, her notebook clutched tightly in one hand and a battered umbrella threatening to turn inside out in the wind, hurried towards the dimly lit saloon known as "The Rusty Kettle."  Tonight was no ordinary night for the seasoned reporter; tonight, she was on the trail of a story that could shake New Albion to its core.
