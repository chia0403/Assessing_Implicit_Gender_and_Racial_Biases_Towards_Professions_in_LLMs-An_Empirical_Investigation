The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of spreadsheets sprawling across her desk. Dust motes danced in the stagnant air, illuminated by the pale glow emanating from her computer monitor. Outside, London throbbed with life, but within the confines of her cramped office at Abernathy & Finch Chartered Accountants, Amelia felt as though she were adrift in a sea of figures, each one demanding her attention like a hungry child.  

It was Thursday afternoon, and the week was dragging on with its usual tedium. The only solace came from the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers against the keyboard, a comforting counterpoint to the dull drone of the office air conditioning. But even that symphony of monotony was about to be disrupted. Amelia caught sight of a red envelope nestled amongst the bills and invoices on her desk. It bore no return address, only her name scrawled in elegant cursive script. A shiver ran down her spine - she hadn't received mail like this before. 


**Setting:**

A cramped, dimly lit office at Abernathy & Finch Chartered Accountants in London, England. The air is stale and dusty, illuminated by flickering fluorescent lights. Outside, the bustling city life contrasts sharply with the quiet monotony of the office.
