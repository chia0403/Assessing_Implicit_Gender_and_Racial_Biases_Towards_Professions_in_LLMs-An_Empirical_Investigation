The insistent hum of the aromatherapy diffuser filled Elara Juniper’s small studio with the scent of lavender and bergamot. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the view of the bustling city street below into a watercolour wash of greys and oranges. Outside, life pulsed with an urgency that felt worlds away from the quiet sanctuary she had created within these walls.  

Elara, her name as delicate and intriguing as a hummingbird’s wing, smoothed down her worn linen apron. She loved the rhythm of her work: the kneading of muscles, the gentle coaxing of tension from knotted shoulders, the whispered sighs of relief that echoed in the small space. It was a world apart from the chaos that seemed to constantly besiege the city.
