The morning mist clung to the Douglas firs like ghostly shrouds, their towering branches heavy with dew. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and pine needles, tinged with a faint metallic tang that whispered of freshly cut wood. 

Jasper "Jax" O'Malley knelt beside the felled giant, its massive trunk still pulsating with life in the dying embers of dawn. His calloused fingers traced the intricate grain patterns etched into the wood, a language he understood better than any spoken word.  Jax inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar comfort of this ancient forest, his heart beating in rhythm with the steady rasp of his chainsaw warming up beside him. He was home. 


**Setting:** A remote section of the Cascade Mountains in Washington state, specifically a dense old-growth Douglas fir forest. It's late summer, and the air is still cool from a recent rainstorm.
