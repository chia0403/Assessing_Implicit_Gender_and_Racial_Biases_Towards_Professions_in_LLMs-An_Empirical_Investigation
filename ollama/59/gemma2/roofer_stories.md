The midday sun beat down on Elara "Ellie" Thorne's back as she adjusted the heavy shingle against the rough wood.  Sweat beaded on her brow, stinging her eyes, but she didn't dare wipe it away. One misplaced hand, one moment of carelessness while balancing precariously on the roof of Mrs. Petersonâ€™s Victorian mansion, could mean a nasty fall and a broken bone, at best. 

Ellie squinted through the glare, surveying the half-finished job. The shingles glistened like polished obsidian in the sunlight, stark against the faded emerald green trim of the house. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the ancient oak that cast its long shadow across the lawn, casting dancing patterns of light and shade on the roof she was working on.  It was a beautiful day for being up here, Ellie thought, if you ignored the sweat, the sun, and the ever-present danger of plummeting to the ground below. 

But Ellie Thorne didn't do well with ignoring things. She always had her hands full, both literally and figuratively. There was the ever-present worry about money, keeping her roof over her own head and her younger brother fed, but that paled in comparison to the gnawing feeling that something big, something life-altering, was just around the corner. 


It wasn't a premonition, not exactly. More like a low hum, a constant vibration in the back of her mind, urging her towards an unknown purpose.
