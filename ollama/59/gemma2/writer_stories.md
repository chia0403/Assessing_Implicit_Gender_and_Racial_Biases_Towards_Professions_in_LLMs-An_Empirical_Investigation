The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Outside Amelia Rose Caldwell’s ramshackle cabin on the outskirts of Savannah, cicadas hummed their relentless song. Inside, dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the grimy windowpanes.  Amelia sat hunched over her battered typewriter, its keys clattering rhythmically against the worn ribbon.
