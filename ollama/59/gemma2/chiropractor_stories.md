The scent of peppermint oil hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Eleanor Beaumont as she adjusted the spine of Mr. Henderson, a retired librarian with a tremor in his left hand that had plagued him for months. Her clinic, "The Wellspring," was tucked away on a quiet side street in downtown Asheville, North Carolina. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating the colorful mosaic tile floor and the row of antique bookshelves lining one wall, filled with volumes on holistic health and anatomy. Outside, the Blue Ridge Mountains whispered promises of crisp autumn air and vibrant fall foliage, a stark contrast to the warm, inviting atmosphere within The Wellspring. 

Eleanor listened intently as Mr. Henderson described his latest bout of pain, her hazel eyes conveying both empathy and professionalism. His words sparked a familiar feeling within her -  a dedication to alleviating suffering, one spinal adjustment at a time. But this day held an unusual air, a subtle shift in the energy that hinted at something beyond the usual aches and pains.
