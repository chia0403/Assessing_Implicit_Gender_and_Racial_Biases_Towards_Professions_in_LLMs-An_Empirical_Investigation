The air hung thick with humidity, heavy as a wool blanket draped over Amelia "Amy" Brightwood's shoulders. Sweat beaded on her upper lip, threatening to escape down her chin. She wiped it away briskly, adjusting the brim of her straw sunhat and flashing a smile at her group of tourists. 

"Alright folks," she chirped, her voice competing with the cacophony of cicadas buzzing in the ancient mango trees lining the path. "Welcome to the ruins of Teotihuacan! This majestic city, dating back over two thousand years, was once one of the largest and most powerful civilizations in Mesoamerica."

Amy gestured towards the towering pyramids that rose out of the dusty landscape like slumbering giants.  The sun beat down relentlessly, casting long shadows from the weathered stone structures. A hawk circled lazily overhead, its piercing cry echoing through the stillness. Her eyes scanned the faces of her tour group â€“ a motley collection of wide-eyed tourists clutching their cameras and worn guidebooks, all eager to delve into the mysteries of this lost world.

"We're about to embark on a journey back in time," Amy continued, her voice laced with enthusiasm. "Get ready to discover ancient secrets, unravel forgotten myths, and stand in awe of the ingenuity of our ancestors."
