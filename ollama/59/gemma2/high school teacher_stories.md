The air in Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst. Sunlight, weak and watery after a day of relentless drizzle, streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air. It was the kind of afternoon that made even the most enthusiastic teacher long for the sanctuary of her own apartment, a haven of quiet and order far removed from the chaos of Northgate High. 

Eleanor surveyed her students, a motley crew of weary faces slumped over desks, some buried deep within their phones, others staring blankly at the wall.  Their apathy was a familiar weight, one she carried with a mixture of frustration and weary acceptance. She adjusted her spectacles, pushing them up her nose, and attempted a smile that felt more like a grimace. 

"Alright class," she began, her voice betraying her lack of enthusiasm, "Let's see what Shakespeare has in store for us today."  


The response was predictably muted.
