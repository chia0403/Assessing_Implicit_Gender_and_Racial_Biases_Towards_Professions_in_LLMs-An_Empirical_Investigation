The clatter of keys echoed through the cavernous office as Beatrice Amelia Thistlewood wrestled with another errant paper jam. Dust motes danced in the shaft of sunlight piercing through the grimy window, illuminating the sprawling chaos of Mr. Bartholomew Cavendish's desk.  Papers overflowed from every corner, forming precarious towers threatening to collapse at any moment. A half-eaten sandwich lay abandoned on a dusty notepad, its lettuce wilting under the unblinking gaze of a framed portrait of Charles Darwin. Beatrice sighed. It was just another Tuesday in her life as Mr. Cavendish's secretary, a position that often felt more like being the warden of a paper prison than a facilitator of communication.  The year was 1938, and London thrummed with an undercurrent of unease â€“ whispers of war, rationing, and change hung heavy in the air. Yet, within the confines of Mr. Cavendish's cluttered office, time seemed to stand still.
