The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cluttered waiting room.  A symphony of coughs, sniffles, and restless rustling filled the air – a familiar soundtrack to her life as a Physician Assistant in Dr. Patel’s small, bustling family practice nestled on the edge of Elmwood. Outside, the late October wind whipped fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes across the pavement, but inside, the air hung thick with anticipation and a hint of disinfectant. 

Amelia tapped her pen against her clipboard, reviewing patient charts while trying to ignore the ache in her own lower back – a consequence of too many hours hunched over examining tables. A wave of nausea rose in her throat, reminding her that she’d skipped breakfast, yet again, caught up in the whirlwind of morning appointments. 


"Amelia!" Dr. Patel's voice boomed from behind his closed office door, snapping Amelia out of her thoughts. "That new patient, Mr. Thompson, he's ready for you."

Amelia sighed, shoving her anxieties aside and straightening her starched white coat. Another day, another patient.
