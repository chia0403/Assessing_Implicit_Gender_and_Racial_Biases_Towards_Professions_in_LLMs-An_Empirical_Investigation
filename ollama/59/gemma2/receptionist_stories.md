The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Kensington’s head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the peeling wallpaper in the waiting room.  A single wilted fern drooped pathetically in a corner, its brown fronds mirroring the state of Amelia's spirits. She tapped her acrylic nails impatiently against the chipped counter, wishing for the tenth time that day she hadn’t answered "Yes" to Mrs. Henderson's desperate plea for help. 

The office was Mrs. Henderson's dream - a quaint little detective agency nestled in a historic building on Elm Street, complete with creaky floorboards and dusty bookshelves overflowing with forgotten case files.  Amelia had pictured herself as a glamorous secretary, pouring endless cups of coffee and fielding calls from dashing detectives. Reality, however, was decidedly less glamorous. The only "dashing" thing about the agency was the occasional stray squirrel that darted through the open window. 

As Amelia stared listlessly at the rain streaking down the dusty glass, the phone rang. It wasn't a ringing sound Amelia particularly liked.  More like a mournful wail, announcing another potential headache. A new case, probably something mundane and tedious. She sighed and reached for the receiver.


"Kensington Detective Agency," she said, trying to inject some enthusiasm into her voice that wasn't there.
