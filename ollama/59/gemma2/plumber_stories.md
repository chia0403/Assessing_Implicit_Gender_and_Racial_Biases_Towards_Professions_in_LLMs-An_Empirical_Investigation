Rain hammered against the rusted corrugated iron roof of Reginald Bartholomew "Reggie" Pipes' workshop, each drop echoing like a tiny hammer blow against his weary skull. The scent of damp earth and engine oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of industrial-strength drain cleaner. Reggie hunched over his workbench, a tangle of copper pipe clutched in his grease-stained hand, muttering curses under his breath. Outside, a storm raged, mirroring the turmoil in Reggie's own soul.  

He was facing eviction. His landlord, Mrs. Hemlock, a woman whose heart was as cold and unforgiving as the November wind, had made it clear that unless he paid the overdue rent by week’s end, he would be out on his ear, along with all his tools, memories, and dreams. Reggie surveyed the cluttered workshop – the worn toolbox, the faded posters of plumbing diagrams, the single flickering fluorescent light casting long shadows on the grimy walls – and felt a wave of despair wash over him. This place was more than just a workspace; it was his sanctuary, his legacy from his father, the man who'd taught him everything he knew about pipes and pressure valves.  


The only glimmer of hope in this bleak landscape was a phone call earlier that day. A woman with a voice as smooth as honey had asked for Reggie by name, promising a job that could change his fortunes – a "high-stakes" plumbing project, she'd said, requiring a master craftsman like himself.  Reggie just hoped he wasn't walking into another one of those ridiculous "ghost-busting" calls Mrs. Hemlock loved to prank him with.
