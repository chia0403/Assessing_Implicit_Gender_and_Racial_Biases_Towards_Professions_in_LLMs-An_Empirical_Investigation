The gilded clock on the wall chimed four times, each clang resonating through the opulent marble lobby of The Grand Regency Hotel like a royal summons. Behind the polished mahogany desk, Alistair Worthington straightened his starched white gloves and surveyed the scene with practiced indifference. It was always this way at this hour: the ebb and flow of tourists bidding farewell to their Parisian adventures, replaced by businessmen clutching briefcases overflowing with dreams – or perhaps just contracts. 

Alistair, however, remained a constant amidst the swirling tide of human ambition and desire. For over twenty years, he had been the unseen conductor of The Grand Regency’s symphony of service, orchestrating every request with a smile as precise and elegant as his perfectly knotted cravat.  He was the gatekeeper to luxury, the whisperer in the ear of extravagance, and tonight, like every night, he awaited his next act.
