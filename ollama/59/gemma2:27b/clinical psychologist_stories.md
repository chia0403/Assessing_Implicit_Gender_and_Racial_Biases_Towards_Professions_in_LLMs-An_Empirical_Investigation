Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Evelyn Albright's office, blurring the cityscape beyond into an Impressionist smudge of grey and yellow. The rhythmic drumming was almost hypnotic, lulling her into a state of near-trance as she stared at the blank notepad before her.  

It wasn't the storm that unsettled her, but the empty chair across from her desk. For the first time in her 15 years practicing clinical psychology, Evelyn had been stood up. No apology text, no frantic voicemail â€“ just the echoing silence of an unanswered appointment. It was unsettling, a crack in the predictable routine she prided herself on.


This particular client, Michael Davenport, had been referred by a colleague specializing in trauma. He was a young artist, struggling with vivid nightmares and crippling anxiety following a near-fatal car accident. Evelyn had meticulously prepared for their session, researching common post-traumatic stress symptoms and even sketching out potential therapeutic approaches. Now, all that meticulous work felt wasted. 

A strange sense of unease crept over her. It wasn't just the missed appointment; it was the unsettling feeling she had about Michael Davenport from the moment his file landed on her desk. There was something about him, a shadow lurking beneath the surface of his profile, that sent shivers down her spine.
