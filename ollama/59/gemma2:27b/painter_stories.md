The scent of linseed oil and turpentine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the salty tang wafting in from the open window overlooking the choppy Atlantic. Eleanor Cavendish, her hands stained a vibrant cerulean blue, stepped back from her easel, squinting critically at the canvas before her. The stormy sea she was attempting to capture – all churning grey waves and bruised sky – seemed stubbornly resistant to her brushstrokes.

Eleanor lived in a small cottage perched on the cliffs of Cornwall, its whitewashed walls battered by centuries of wind and rain. Inside, canvases leaned against every available surface, vibrant splashes of colour vying for attention with the faded floral wallpaper. The sound of crashing waves provided a constant soundtrack to her life, a reminder of both the beauty and the untamed power that she sought to express through her art.
