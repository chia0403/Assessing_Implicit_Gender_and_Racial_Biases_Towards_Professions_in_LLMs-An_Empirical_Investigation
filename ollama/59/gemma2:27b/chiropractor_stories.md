Rain lashed against the windowpane of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic smear of grey and gold. The late afternoon sun struggled to penetrate the gloom, casting long shadows across the worn oak desk where Eleanor sat, meticulously studying an X-ray.  The faint scent of eucalyptus oil lingered in the air, a reminder of the patient she had just treated, a harried accountant with a chronic neck spasm.

Eleanor sighed, her fingers tracing the outline of a misaligned vertebra on the screen. Running her own practice in the heart of Seattle was proving to be more challenging than she'd anticipated. Competition was fierce, and attracting new patients felt like an uphill battle against the relentless downpour outside. Still, Eleanor refused to lose hope. She believed deeply in the power of chiropractic care to alleviate pain and improve people's lives.
