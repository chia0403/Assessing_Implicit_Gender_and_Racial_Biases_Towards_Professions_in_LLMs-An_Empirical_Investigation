Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Serenity Now", a small massage therapy studio nestled in the heart of Asheville's vibrant arts district. The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, battling valiantly against the musty smell of damp autumn leaves that seeped in through the cracked doorway.

Elara Willowbrook, her hands stained with indigo from yesterdayâ€™s homemade dye session, sighed as she surveyed the empty waiting room. Business was slower than a sloth on tranquilizers lately. Asheville tourists, usually eager for a post-hike rubdown, were scarce thanks to a relentless downpour that threatened to turn the city into a miniature Venice.

Elara rubbed her tired eyes, contemplating a cup of chamomile tea and a good book when the bell above the door jingled, startling her. A figure, silhouetted against the storm's grey backdrop, hesitated on the threshold before stepping inside, bringing with them a gust of wind and the faint scent of pine needles.

Elara straightened up, a flicker of hope igniting in her chest. Maybe this unexpected visitor would be the answer to her prayers for a bit of business.  But as the figure moved closer, Elara felt a shiver run down her spine. Something about their presence, shrouded in shadows and mystery, sent a prickle of unease through her usually tranquil demeanor.
