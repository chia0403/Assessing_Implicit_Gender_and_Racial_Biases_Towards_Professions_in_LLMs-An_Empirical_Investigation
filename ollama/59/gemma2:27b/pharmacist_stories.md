Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elmwood Pharmacy, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a feverish shimmer. The air inside was thick with the scent of lavender hand sanitizer and dusty cough syrup bottles. Eloise Finch, her auburn braid escaping its bun like a rebellious vine, sighed as she tallied the dwindling stock of flu medication. Winter had come early to Maple Creek, bringing with it a wave of sniffles, coughs, and an unsettling anxiety that hummed beneath the surface of everyday life.

Eloise glanced at the clock, its hands creeping towards closing time. She longed for the quiet solace of her book-lined apartment, a cup of chamomile tea steaming in her hands. But Maple Creek was a town where secrets lingered like the fog that clung to the riverbanks, and tonight felt different. The silence between customers was pregnant with something unspoken, a tension that pricked at Eloise's intuition.
