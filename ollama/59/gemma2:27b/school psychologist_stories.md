Rain hammered against the warped windowpane of Dr. Evelyn Rosewell’s office, blurring the already desolate landscape beyond. Grey clouds pressed down on the small town of Havenwood like a shroud, mirroring the heaviness that seemed to permeate every corner of the aging brick building. Evelyn sighed, her gaze drifting from the dreary scene outside to the stack of student files piled precariously on her desk. Each file represented another young mind struggling with the invisible weight of childhood anxieties, bullying, or family issues – burdens she felt keenly responsible for alleviating.

Havenwood High, a crumbling edifice built in an era when optimism seemed more readily available, was Evelyn's battleground. The school's hallways echoed with whispered rumors and teenage angst, its classrooms filled with students battling their own internal storms. Today, however, a new storm brewed on her horizon – one she hadn’t anticipated. A call had come in just minutes before the bell rang for dismissal, a voice laced with urgency requesting her immediate presence in the principal's office. Evelyn straightened in her chair, a shiver running down her spine despite the stuffy air. Something wasn't right.
