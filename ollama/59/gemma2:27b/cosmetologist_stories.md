The humid Florida air clung to Amelia "Amy" Dubois like a second skin as she wrestled with the rusted back door of her salon.  Sunshine Beauty Emporium wasn't much to look at – faded turquoise paint peeling from the weatherbeaten wood, a neon sign that flickered more than it glowed – but inside was Amy's kingdom. 

The scent of coconut oil and hairspray hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of jasmine from the diffuser tucked behind her styling station. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating the worn leather chairs and chipped porcelain sinks. It wasn't glamorous, but it was hers.  Amy smoothed down her floral apron, a touch of anxiety tugging at her gut. Today was different. Today, she wasn't just transforming hair; she was about to transform a life.
