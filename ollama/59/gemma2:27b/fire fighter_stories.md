The siren's wail sliced through Amelia "Amy" Reyes' dream of swimming in an endless pool of shimmering turquoise water. She jolted upright, her heart hammering against her ribs like a trapped bird. Smoke. It always started with smoke. Amy scrambled out of bed, the familiar adrenaline surge already coursing through her veins.  She pulled on her fire-resistant pants and boots, the worn fabric comforting in its familiarity. The air outside her tiny apartment was thick with the acrid tang of burning wood. 

Her fire station, Station 17, wasn't far â€“ a crumbling brick building nestled amongst towering steel and glass skyscrapers in downtown Chicago.  The streetlights cast long, distorted shadows as Amy raced towards the hulking silhouette of the station, her boots pounding against the unforgiving asphalt. The night was alive with the rhythmic pulse of sirens, a symphony of impending chaos.
