The rusty hinges of the barn door groaned like an old man complaining about the weather as Elias Blackwood wrestled it open. A wave of warm, hay-scented air rushed out, carrying with it the familiar symphony of the ranch: the lowing of cattle, the clucking of hens, and the insistent chirp of sparrows nesting in the eaves. 

Elias squinted against the rising sun, its golden rays painting long shadows across the dusty yard. He was a man carved from the same rugged landscape that surrounded him â€“ broad-shouldered, weather-beaten, with eyes as blue and deep as the summer sky.  His calloused hands, scarred from years of wrangling cattle and mending fences, adjusted his worn Stetson as he surveyed his domain.  

Today promised to be a long one. The spring rains had brought new life to the land but also a surge of opportunistic predators looking for an easy meal amongst the newborn calves. Elias knew he'd spend most of the day patrolling the sprawling pastures, keeping a watchful eye on his herd and ensuring they remained safe from coyotes and stray dogs.
