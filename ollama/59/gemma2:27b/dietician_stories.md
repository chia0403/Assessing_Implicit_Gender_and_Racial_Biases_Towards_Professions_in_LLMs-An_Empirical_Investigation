Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign outside. Inside the tiny diner booth, Amelia Grace Cartwright, RD, sighed and pushed her half-eaten plate of lukewarm fries aside. It wasn't the greasy food that was bothering her – Amelia had a weakness for french fries, a vice she readily admitted to her clients – it was the feeling of being utterly stuck.

The air in the diner smelled faintly of stale coffee and frying oil, a scent that usually comforted Amelia, but tonight it felt oppressive. For months, she'd been working tirelessly at the community health center, preaching the gospel of balanced meals and mindful eating. Yet, her efforts seemed to fall on deaf ears. Her clients, mostly low-income families struggling to make ends meet, were more concerned with putting food on the table than worrying about nutritional value.

Tonight, Amelia was questioning everything. Was she making a difference? Were her qualifications even relevant in this world where survival trumped health? As another clap of thunder rattled the diner windows, Amelia knew she needed a change. She just didn't know what that change should be.
