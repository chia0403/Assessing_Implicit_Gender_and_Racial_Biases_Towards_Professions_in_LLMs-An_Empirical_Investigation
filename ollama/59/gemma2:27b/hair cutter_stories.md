The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and something acrid – probably burnt hair, Emilia thought wryly.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of "Emilia's Emporium", illuminating swirling motes and catching on the glint of her scissors. Outside, the sounds of Camden Market were a cacophony: hawkers yelling, tourists chattering, music blasting from a nearby stall. Inside, it was quiet save for the gentle snip-snip of Emilia Thorne’s shears as she sculpted a bob onto the head of Mrs. Higgins, a regular who always wanted her hair "just like Princess Diana's". 


Emilia sighed inwardly.  She loved Mrs. Higgins dearly, but sometimes wished for something more exciting than endless bobs and perms.  She longed to wield her scissors with artistry, to create styles that were bold and daring, not just safe and predictable. Today, though, she’d be content with transforming Mrs. Higgins' frazzled curls into a semblance of royal elegance. After all, even princesses need a touch-up now and then.
