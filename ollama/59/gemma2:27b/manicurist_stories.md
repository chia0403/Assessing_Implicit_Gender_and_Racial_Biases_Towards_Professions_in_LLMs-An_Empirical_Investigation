The humid air hung heavy in "Nails by Nadia," thick with the scent of acetone, lavender polish, and something indefinable that Nadia swore was pure sunshine bottled up. Outside, Miami buzzed with its usual chaotic symphony – honking horns, salsa music spilling from open doorways, and the insistent chatter of Spanish mingling with English. But inside her tiny salon, nestled in a vibrant Little Havana alleyway, Nadia found her haven. She sat perched on her cushioned stool, delicately filing the nail of Mrs. Diaz, who was regaling her with tales of her granddaughter's quinceañera dress fitting.

Nadia, whose full name was Nadia Esmeralda Cruz-Rodriguez, felt a comforting warmth spread through her chest as she listened. Mrs. Diaz wasn't just a client; she was family. And in this tiny space, adorned with hand-painted floral murals and overflowing with potted orchids, Nadia treated every single person who walked through the door like kin.  

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as a stranger entered the salon, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat. He stood awkwardly in the doorway, shifting from foot to foot, and Nadia couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just another walk-in needing a manicure.
