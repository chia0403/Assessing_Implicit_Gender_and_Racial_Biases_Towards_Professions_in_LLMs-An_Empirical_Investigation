Rain hammered against the windows of the "Little Explorers" daycare center, blurring the already faded crayon drawings taped to the glass. Inside, Amelia Rosewell sighed, watching the downpour through tired eyes. The usual afternoon chaos had settled into a quieter lull, the toddlers lulled by the rhythmic drumming of raindrops and the soft lullabies playing from Amelia's phone.

She sat cross-legged on a colorful rug, surrounded by sleeping children. Tiny breaths rose and fell in the dimly lit room, punctuated by the occasional snuffle or whimper. Amelia gently brushed a stray strand of hair from three-year-old Liam's forehead, his thumb firmly planted in his mouth. 


This quiet was a rare gift at "Little Explorers." Amelia loved her job, truly she did, but today the exhaustion was clinging to her like a wet blanket. The daycare center was short-staffed again, leaving her to juggle twenty rambunctious toddlers single-handedly. It was moments like these, surrounded by slumbering innocence, that she questioned her sanity. But then Liam's hand would tighten around hers in his sleep, and Amelia's heart would melt a little, reminding her why she chose this path.

Suddenly, the doorbell chimed, jarring Amelia from her reverie. She froze, glancing at the clock. It was almost 5 pm, well past pick-up time. Who could it be?
