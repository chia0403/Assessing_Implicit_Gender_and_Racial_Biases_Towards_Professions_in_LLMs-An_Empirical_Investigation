The Grand Blackwood Hotel loomed over the cobblestone street like a gothic monolith, its shadow swallowing Reginald Thaddeus Quincy III whole as he hustled through the revolving door.  Reggie, as everyone affectionately (or not so affectionately) called him, was a bellhop at the Grand Blackwood, and tonight felt different. The air itself crackled with anticipation, thick with the scent of expensive perfume and nervous excitement.

A gaggle of giggling debutantes in impossibly frothy gowns giggled their way past him, their laughter echoing off the mahogany walls of the opulent lobby.  Reggie adjusted the strap of his heavy luggage cart, the weight of a dozen suitcases threatening to pull his shoulder out of its socket. He caught a glimpse of himself in the gilded mirror behind the front desk â€“ pale, skinny, and hopelessly out of place amongst the wealth and glamour swirling around him.

Tonight was the Blackwood Ball, an annual event that drew society's elite from miles around. Reggie knew he wouldn't be invited to join the festivities. He was just a bellhop, after all, destined to spend the night ferrying suitcases and navigating the labyrinthine corridors of this gilded cage.
