The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, turning it the color of a ripe tomato. He perched precariously on the slanted slate roof of Mrs. Higgins' Victorian mansion, sweat dripping into his eyes. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling of tar and chimney smoke. Below him, the manicured lawn sprawled like a green carpet, dotted with colorful rose bushes that looked impossibly delicate from his vantage point. Elias ran a calloused hand over the weathered slate, feeling its rough texture beneath his gloves. This was his world: heights, angles, and the constant dance between gravity and trust. He wasn't afraid of heights; he respected them. 


He tightened a loose tile with practiced ease, his movements fluid despite the awkwardness of the position.  Elias loved the solitude this job brought. Up here, amongst the chimneys and gargoyles, he could lose himself in the rhythm of hammering, the satisfying click of nails finding their mark, and the slow transformation of a decaying roof into something sturdy and new.

But today, the usual peace was interrupted by a persistent gnawing feeling in his gut – a sense that something wasn't quite right. It started with the faint smell of ozone, like a distant thunderstorm brewing. Then he noticed the unsettling stillness of the air, broken only by the chirping of a lone sparrow perched on the roof peak.  Even Mrs. Higgins’ usually yappy chihuahua, Pepe, was silent. Elias paused, tilting his head to listen for any sign of trouble. The world seemed to hold its breath.
