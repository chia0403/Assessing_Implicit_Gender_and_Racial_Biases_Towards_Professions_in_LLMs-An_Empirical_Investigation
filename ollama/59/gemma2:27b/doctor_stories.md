Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's clinic, blurring the already fading neon sign that read "Hopewell Medical: Where Healing Begins." The incessant drumming mirrored the turmoil in Evelyn's chest. She tugged at her collar, feeling the dampness seep through her worn cotton shirt. Hopewell, a forgotten coal town nestled in the heart of Appalachia, was barely clinging to life, much like the patients she saw every day.

The clinic itself was a relic of a bygone era – chipped paint peeling from the walls, threadbare carpet stained with years of spilled coffee and disinfectant. A lone, flickering fluorescent light cast an anemic glow on the waiting room, sparsely populated tonight by two coughing men huddled in threadbare coats and a young woman clutching a whimpering child.

Evelyn sighed, her breath fogging the air. She hadn't expected Hopewell to be so… desolate. Coming from the bustling city hospital she'd trained in, this felt like a different world altogether – one where despair seemed as commonplace as the coal dust that settled on everything.
