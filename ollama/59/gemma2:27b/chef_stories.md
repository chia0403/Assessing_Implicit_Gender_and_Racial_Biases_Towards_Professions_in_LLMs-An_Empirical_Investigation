Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of The Salty Spoon, a rhythmic counterpoint to the sizzle of onions in butter. Emilia "Em" Moreau, her face flushed from the heat of the stovetop and the exertion of chopping enough vegetables for a small army, peered out at the downpour. It was the kind of night that made you crave comfort food - thick stews, crusty bread, maybe a warming glass of mulled wine.

The Salty Spoon wasn't known for fine dining. Nestled in a ramshackle corner of Port Haven, a small fishing village clinging to the craggy Cornish coast, it was more a haven for weary fishermen and salty-haired locals. But Em poured her heart into every dish she served, transforming simple ingredients into culinary havens that warmed the soul as much as the stomach. 


Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she glanced at the lone figure hunched over a pint in the corner booth â€“ a man shrouded in shadow, his face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat. He hadn't ordered food, only the single beer, which he nursed with an unsettling intensity.

Em shook off the feeling. Port Haven was a village where secrets whispered on the wind, and strange characters weren't uncommon. Still, as she turned back to her stove, the man's eyes seemed to bore into her back, sending another shiver down her spine.
