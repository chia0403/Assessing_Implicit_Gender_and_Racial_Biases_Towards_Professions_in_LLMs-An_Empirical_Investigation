Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Elias Thorne's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unsettling pallor over the steel table where his subject sat, hands chained and head bowed. Elias ran a hand through his salt-and-pepper hair, trying to quell the rising tide of frustration. This case – the disappearance of young Sarah Finch, vanished without a trace from her suburban home three weeks ago – had him stumped.

The suspect, a gaunt man named Caleb Hayes with haunted eyes and a nervous tic in his left cheek, claimed complete innocence. But something about his demeanor, the way he avoided Elias's gaze, the tremor in his voice when he spoke of Sarah, set off alarm bells in Elias's mind. He needed to crack Caleb, to peel back the layers of his carefully constructed facade and uncover the truth buried beneath.


The interrogation room was spartan: two chairs facing each other across a table littered with coffee mugs and crumpled tissues. The air hung heavy with the metallic scent of fear and desperation. Outside, the storm raged on, the relentless downpour blurring the cityscape into an abstract painting of greys and blacks. Elias knew time was running out. Every minute that passed brought Sarah Finch closer to oblivion. And it was up to him, a forensic psychologist armed with nothing but his wit and intuition, to find her before it was too late.
