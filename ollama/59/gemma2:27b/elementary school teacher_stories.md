The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn, wooden floorboards of Ms. Eleanor Rosethorne's classroom. Crayons lay scattered like fallen autumn leaves, forgotten amidst the half-finished drawings of dragons and spaceships. A faint smell of glue lingered in the air, a bittersweet reminder of the day's creativity now winding down. Outside, the wind whistled through the ancient oak trees lining the playground, their rustling leaves echoing the restless anticipation brewing in Ms. Rosethorne's chest.

It wasn't the approaching weekend that stirred her unease, nor the mountain of ungraded papers on her desk. Tonight was Open House, and while she loved connecting with parents, a knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach. This year felt different. There was a palpable tension amongst the students, whispers shared in hushed tones, averted gazes.

Something was amiss, and Eleanor Rosethorne, despite her gentle demeanor and penchant for whimsical storytelling, had a knack for sensing when things weren't quite right.
