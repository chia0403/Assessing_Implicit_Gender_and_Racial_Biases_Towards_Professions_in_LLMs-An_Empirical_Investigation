Rain lashed against the windows of Elmwood Veterinary Clinic, blurring the already fading light of dusk. Dr. Amelia Blackwood sighed, her breath fogging the glass momentarily before disappearing into the relentless storm. She traced a fingertip along the condensation, leaving a fleeting trail that mirrored the restlessness in her soul.

The clinic, usually bustling with furry patients and concerned owners, was eerily quiet.

She should have been heading home hours ago, but a particularly stubborn case of canine distemper had kept her glued to her microscope until just now.

The phone on her desk buzzed abruptly, shattering the silence. It was a call she couldn't ignore.  Dr. Blackwood straightened, her shoulders easing into the familiar weight of responsibility. Whatever awaited her on the other end of the line, she knew one thing for sure – it wouldn't be easy. 

The storm, Amelia thought grimly, was just beginning.
