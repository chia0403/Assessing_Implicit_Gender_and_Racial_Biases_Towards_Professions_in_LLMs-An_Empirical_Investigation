Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Finch's cramped apartment, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head. Lines of code scrolled across his monitor, a dizzying cascade of semicolons, brackets, and cryptic function names. Elias ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair, frustration tightening its icy grip around his chest. For weeks he had been wrestling with this bug, a stubborn anomaly buried deep within the algorithm he was building for the city's new automated traffic system. 

The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow across his desk, highlighting the overflowing coffee mugs and crumpled pizza boxes that littered the space. Elias hadn't slept much in days, fuelled by caffeine and sheer determination. This project was more than just a job; it was his ticket out of this dreary existence, a chance to prove himself and finally leave his mark on the world. 

But the bug remained, taunting him like a digital gremlin.  Elias stared at the screen, willing the solution to appear. He knew he needed fresh eyes, a different perspective, but who could he possibly turn to? His social circle consisted mainly of other sleep-deprived programmers and the occasional delivery driver.

Then, as if in answer to his silent plea, a faint buzzing emanated from his phone. An unfamiliar number. Elias hesitated, then tapped the screen, bracing himself for another telemarketer or worse.
