Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thorne's workshop, each drop exploding in a tiny burst of noise. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt copper, a familiar perfume to Elias, whose calloused hands were currently wrestling with a tangled mess of wires emanating from a vintage radio. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, tossing skeletal branches against the windowpanes. 

Elias, his face illuminated by the harsh glow of a bare bulb hanging from the ceiling, grunted in frustration. The radio, a magnificent Art Deco masterpiece he'd salvaged from a condemned house, stubbornly refused to sing. He suspected a faulty capacitor, but finding the culprit amongst the labyrinthine circuitry was proving a monumental task.

He glanced at the clock on the wall â€“ 2:17 AM. Sleep seemed a distant dream tonight. Not that Elias minded much; his work often bled into the wee hours. Besides, he had a reputation to uphold in this sleepy coastal town of Havenwood. When something electrical sputtered or died, it was Elias Thorne they called, the man who could coax life back into even the most obstinate machines.
