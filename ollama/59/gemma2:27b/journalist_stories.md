Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Quill pub, mimicking the drumming anxiety in Amelia Harding’s chest.  The air inside was thick with the smell of stale beer, fried onions, and desperation – a familiar cocktail in this part of Dublin.  Amelia, a journalist for the struggling online paper "Dublin Echo," nursed a lukewarm Guinness, her eyes scanning the faces around her.

She was searching for Liam O'Connell, a dockworker rumored to have information about the recent string of disappearances plaguing the city. The police were calling it a missing persons case, but Amelia suspected something far more sinister.  Her gut screamed conspiracy, fueled by whispers in shadowed alleys and cryptic messages scribbled on torn newspaper clippings. 


Liam was her only lead, a man who lived on the fringes, his world one of hard labor and whispered secrets. He knew the docks like the back of his hand, saw things others missed. Would he trust her enough to speak?  The answer, Amelia realized with a shiver, could be the difference between cracking the case wide open and watching another innocent soul vanish into thin air.
