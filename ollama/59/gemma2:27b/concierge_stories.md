The rain hammered against the ornate glass doors of The Grand Meridian, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. Eleanor Vance sighed, smoothing down her crisp white uniform blouse. It was barely past noon, and already the lobby felt stiflingly humid.  

Eleanor, Chief Concierge at The Grand Meridian for the last eight years, prided herself on remaining unflappable. But today, even she felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Tonight, the hotel was hosting its annual Midsummer Gala – a lavish affair attended by the city's elite. 

She glanced around the cavernous lobby: polished marble floors reflecting the dim chandelier light, antique furniture arranged in elegant clusters, and a roaring fire crackling merrily in the hearth. The air hung heavy with the scent of lilies and lavender, a fragrance specifically chosen to evoke a sense of timeless grandeur. But beneath the surface sheen, Eleanor sensed a growing unease. 

Something wasn't right. It started with a series of cryptic messages left on her desk – anonymous notes hinting at a hidden danger lurking within the hotel walls. Then there was the unsettling behavior of Mr. Sinclair, the enigmatic billionaire who had booked the penthouse suite for the duration of the gala. His cold, calculating gaze followed Eleanor everywhere she went, making her skin crawl.

As the first guests began to arrive, dressed in their finest attire, Eleanor knew she couldn't ignore the whispers of impending doom. The Midsummer Gala was supposed to be a celebration. But tonight, it felt more like a countdown to disaster.
