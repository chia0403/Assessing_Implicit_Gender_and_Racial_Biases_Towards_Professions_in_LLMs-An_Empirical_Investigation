The stale air in the cramped office clung to Amelia Rose Cartwright like a second skin. Stacks of student files threatened to topple from her overcrowded desk, each one representing a life teetering on the precipice of adulthood. Outside, the October wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied dances across the asphalt playground of Northgate High School. Amelia sighed, running a hand through her perpetually messy bun.

Some clutched crumpled essays, others frantically searched for misplaced transcripts. Amelia longed for the quiet sanctuary of her own home, a haven filled with the comforting scent of lavender candles and the soft purr of her cat, Mr. Whiskers.

"Hi there," Amelia chirped, her voice tinged with forced cheerfulness. "You must be David Peterson? What can I do for you today?"
