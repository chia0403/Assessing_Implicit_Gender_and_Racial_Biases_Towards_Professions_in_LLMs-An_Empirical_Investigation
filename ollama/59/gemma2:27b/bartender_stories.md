Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Mug, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a watercolour mess.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and desperation. Reginald "Reg" Hawthorne, his greying ponytail escaping its elastic band, wiped down the already spotless bartop for the tenth time that hour. The clock above the door ticked relentlessly towards midnight, mocking Reg's dwindling hope for a decent tip. Tuesdays were always slow in this part of town - a forgotten corner where dreams went to rust and ambition curdled into cynicism.

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced down Reg's spine as he glanced at the lone figure hunched over a glass of amber liquid in the far corner. The man was shrouded in shadow, his face obscured by the wide brim of his hat. He hadn't spoken a word since entering, just sat nursing his drink with an intensity that bordered on unnerving.
