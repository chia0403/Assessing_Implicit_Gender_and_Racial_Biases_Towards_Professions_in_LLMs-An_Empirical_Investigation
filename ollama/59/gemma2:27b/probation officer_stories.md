Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Beatrice "Bea" Holloway's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the stacks of case files piled on her desk. Bea rubbed her tired eyes, the weight of responsibility pressing down on her shoulders like a physical burden. Outside, the city of Ashwood groaned under the deluge, its shadows deepening with each flash of lightning.

It was 5:47 pm, well past quitting time, and Bea was still poring over the file of Jeremiah "Jerry" Hayes, a young man recently released from prison for petty theft. His probation terms were strict, demanding regular check-ins, employment verification, and participation in a court-mandated rehabilitation program. But Jerry had missed his last two appointments, and something about his case nagged at Bea's gut. Was he simply overwhelmed, or was there something more sinister afoot? 


The phone on her desk buzzed, startling her. It was Sergeant Miller from the Ashwood Police Department, a gruff man with a voice like gravel. "Holloway," he growled, "Got a situation down at the docks. Think it might involve your boy Hayes."
