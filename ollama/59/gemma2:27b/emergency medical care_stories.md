Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon signs of the city into streaks of color.  Inside, Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes double-checked her equipment, the familiar weight of the stethoscope and trauma shears comforting against the insistent rumble of the siren. Tonight was Esme's first solo shift as a paramedic for Mercy City EMS. The pressure was on â€“ she needed to prove herself, not just to her colleagues but to the echo of doubt that whispered in her own mind. 

The dispatcher crackled through the radio, "Unit 42, possible cardiac arrest at the intersection of Elm and Hawthorne." Esme took a deep breath,  gripped the steering wheel tighter, and pressed down on the accelerator. The red lights pulsed against the wet asphalt, carving a path through the storm-tossed city towards the unknown.
