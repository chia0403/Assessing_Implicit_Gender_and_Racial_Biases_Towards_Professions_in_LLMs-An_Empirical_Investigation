The humid air hung thick and heavy over Savannah's cobblestone squares, perfumed with jasmine and the faint scent of decaying leaves. Amelia Winthrop adjusted her straw hat, its wide brim casting a welcome shadow over her face. Tourists milled around her, faces flushed from the Georgia sun, their cameras clicking incessantly.
