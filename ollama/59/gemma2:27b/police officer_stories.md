Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound. A chill wind whipped through the shattered windows, carrying the smell of salt and decay. This part of the docks was always bleak, but tonight it felt especially desolate. Detective Inspector Amelia "Amy" Blackwood pulled her threadbare raincoat tighter around herself, shivering despite the adrenaline coursing through her veins.

She crouched beside a body sprawled on the damp concrete floor, its face illuminated by the harsh beam of her flashlight. The victim, a young man judging by his build, was dressed in the torn remnants of what had once been a fashionable suit. Blood, dark and sticky, pooled around him, staining the already grimy floor crimson. Amy's stomach churned at the sight.

This wasn't how she'd pictured her first case back after leave.
