The rusty red dust swirled around Amelia “Ace” Callahan's boots as she surveyed the ramshackle landing strip. Wind whipped her braids across her face, tasting faintly of engine oil and something wilder – the untamed scent of the Aethel Desert. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the battered hull of Ace's freighter, the "Rust Bucket," into a shimmering mirage.  

Ace sighed, pushing her goggles up onto her forehead. This wasn't exactly what she'd pictured when she signed up for this transport job. She was used to hauling cargo through the lush green valleys and towering mountain ranges of Earth Prime, not navigating sandstorms and dodging rogue sandskimmers in this desolate wasteland. 

But desperate times called for desperate measures. The Aethel Guild was her only option after the incident with the Starfire Corporation – a story best left buried for now.  This job, delivering a crate marked "Fragile: Ancient Artifacts" to a remote outpost on the edge of the Shifting Sands, promised enough credits to clear her name and buy herself a ticket off this dying planet.
