Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom, mimicking the storm brewing inside her chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the stacks of ungraded essays piled precariously on her desk. Outside, the late October wind shrieked through the ancient oak trees lining Elmwood High School’s grounds, their branches clawing at the windows like skeletal fingers.  

Eleanor stared out at the swirling grayness, willing herself to focus on the lesson plan splayed open before her. Tomorrow was Shakespeare Day, and she had planned a lively debate about Hamlet's motivations. But with every gust of wind, with every flash of lightning that momentarily illuminated the desolate playground, Eleanor felt her resolve crumble. The news from earlier that day – the budget cuts threatening to gut the arts program at Elmwood – played on repeat in her mind.
