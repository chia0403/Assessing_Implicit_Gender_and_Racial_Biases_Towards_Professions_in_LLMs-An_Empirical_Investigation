The greasy scent of motor oil and burnt rubber hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet tang of gasoline. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windows of Benny "Gearhead" Grimaldi's garage, illuminating motes of dust dancing in its path. Tools clattered against metal workbenches, punctuated by the guttural roar of an engine struggling to life. Benny, a man built like a bulldog with hands calloused and stained black, wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his forearm, his gaze fixed intently on the carburetor he was adjusting. 

The garage, nestled in the heart of Pittsburgh's rust belt, wasn't much to look at - a rambling brick building with peeling paint and faded neon signage promising "Honest Repairs, Fair Prices." But within its walls, Benny could breathe. Here, surrounded by the familiar symphony of clangs, whirs, and sputters, he felt truly alive. He was more than just an auto mechanic; he was a healer of metal beasts, a whisperer to engines. Today, though, even Benny's expertise seemed challenged by the stubborn roar emanating from beneath the hood of a rusted 1967 Mustang. This wasn't just any repair job - this car held a piece of his past, and fixing it felt like trying to mend a broken part of himself.
