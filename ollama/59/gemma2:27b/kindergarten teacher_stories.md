Rain lashed against the classroom windows, mimicking the chaotic symphony playing out within.  Eleanor Rose Cartwright, her blonde curls escaping their usual neat bun, surveyed the scene with a tired sigh.  Crayons littered the floor like fallen autumn leaves, building blocks formed precarious towers threatening imminent collapse, and five-year-old Liam was currently attempting to scale the bookshelf while shrieking "I'm a monkey king!"

Eleanor loved her job, she truly did. Witnessing the unbridled imagination and joy of kindergarteners was a privilege. But some days, like this one where the wind howled outside mimicking the tantrums brewing within, felt more akin to wrangling a pack of particularly energetic puppies than nurturing young minds.
