Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elodie Beaumont's studio, each drop a tiny hammer blow against her already frayed nerves. The Parisian twilight bled through the grimy skylight, casting long shadows across the canvases stacked haphazardly around the room. A chill hung in the air, thick with the scent of turpentine and unfulfilled dreams.

Elodie, her face pale beneath a tangled nest of auburn hair, stared at the blank canvas before her. It mocked her, its emptiness a reflection of the void that had settled within her since her mentor's passing. Monsieur Dubois, a gruff but brilliant painter who had seen something in Elodie's talent, was gone, leaving behind only a legacy of unfinished masterpieces and a weight of expectation that threatened to crush her. 


She needed inspiration, a spark to ignite the creative flame that seemed extinguished within her. But Paris, once a vibrant muse, now felt like a cage, its cobbled streets and grand boulevards echoing with ghosts of what she could have been.

Then, a sound pierced through the drumming rain – a rhythmic thumping followed by a melodic whistle. Elodie frowned, her gaze drawn to the source: a lone figure striding down the deserted street, silhouetted against the stormy sky.  Something about the figure’s posture, the way they carried themselves with an air of purposeful defiance, intrigued her. Perhaps this was the spark she needed, the unexpected encounter that could reawaken her soul and set her brushstrokes alight once more.
