The air hung thick with the metallic scent of blood and the sweet, earthy aroma of rosemary. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Prague's Old Town bustled with tourists snapping pictures of the astronomical clock and vendors hawking Trdelník pastries. But inside "U Králíka" (At the Rabbit), it was a symphony of clanging cleavers, whirring grinders, and gruff pronouncements from its proprietor: Bohuslav Josef Novák. 

Bohuslav's hands, gnarled like ancient tree roots, worked with practiced precision as he deboned a leg of lamb. His face, creased with wrinkles that spoke of countless early mornings and late nights, was etched with a sternness that belied the twinkle in his pale blue eyes. He surveyed his domain -  the sawdust-strewn floor, the hanging hams glistening under the dim gaslights, the shelves stacked high with jars of pickled onions and smoked paprika. 

This butcher shop had been in his family for generations, a legacy he carried with pride and unwavering dedication. Today, however, something felt different. A subtle unease gnawed at him, a feeling like a fly buzzing just beyond his reach. It started with the strange delivery this morning – a crate marked only with a cryptic symbol: a serpent coiled around a sword. Inside, nestled amongst blocks of ice, lay a side of beef unlike any he'd seen before.
