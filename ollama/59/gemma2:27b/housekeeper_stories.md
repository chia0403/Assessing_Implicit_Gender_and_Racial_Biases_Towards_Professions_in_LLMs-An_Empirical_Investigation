The stale scent of mothballs and lemon polish clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin.  It was a smell she'd come to associate with comfort, with routine, with the quiet rhythm of her life.  

Amelia pushed her trolley down the cavernous hallway of Blackwood Manor, its mahogany floor gleaming under the weak rays of dawn filtering through arched windows. Dust motes danced in the golden light, swirling around antique portraits that stared down at her with judging eyes. She knew each face by heart â€“ Lord Blackwood, stern and unsmiling; his wife, Eleanor, forever frozen in a delicate smile; their children, mischievous and eternally youthful.

They were ghosts now, whispering through the empty rooms, leaving Amelia to tend their legacy.
