The biting wind whipped across the obsidian plains, stinging Elias Thorne's exposed cheeks. His thick woolen cloak offered little protection against the relentless chill that gnawed at him from within. Above, the twin moons hung low in the sky, casting an ethereal blue light upon the desolate landscape. 

Elias, a seasoned guard of the Obsidian Citadel, squinted into the distance. For miles around, there was nothing but jagged black rock formations and the occasional gnarled, skeletal tree struggling to survive in the harsh environment. The Citadel itself, a monolithic structure carved directly into the heart of a mountain, loomed ahead, its obsidian walls shimmering under the moons' glow. 

Elias tightened his grip on his spear, its polished iron tip glinting ominously. Today was the annual Shadow Equinox, a time when the veil between worlds thinned and the Citadel became vulnerable to attacks from creatures that lurked in the dark beyond. A shiver ran down his spine despite the cold. He'd seen what those creatures could do, their obsidian claws tearing through flesh and bone with horrifying ease.

He wasn't alone. Other guards patrolled the perimeter, their silhouettes stark against the moonlit landscape. Their faces were grim, their eyes scanning for any sign of movement. They knew, as Elias did, that tonight was no ordinary night. Tonight, they would stand guard against the shadows.
