Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the stainless steel counters cluttered with tubes, needles, and requisition forms.

She treated each draw with reverence, understanding that within those tiny vials flowed not only blood, but stories - whispers of illness, resilience, and hope.

As the first wave of patients shuffled in, their faces etched with worry and anticipation, Eliza braced herself for whatever the day might bring.  Little did she know that this seemingly ordinary Tuesday would unravel into a series of unnerving events, leading her down a rabbit hole she never anticipated venturing into.
