The air in the Château de la Roche was thick with tension, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner.  Alistair "Al" Finchley, renowned for his gritty, realistic war films, paced behind the long mahogany table, frustration etched onto his normally jovial face.

He'd envisioned this meeting as a triumphant return to France, where he’d shot his Oscar-nominated masterpiece “The Siege of Calais”. Instead, he was staring down the barrels of skepticism from the film's financiers. Château de la Roche, a crumbling, yet majestic chateau perched on a cliff overlooking the jagged coastline of Normandy, felt more like a prison than the idyllic setting it was supposed to be.  

Al needed this project, his passion project: "Echoes of Dunkirk", a sprawling epic that would chronicle the evacuation through the eyes of ordinary people caught in the chaos. But convincing these hardened investors to see his vision, let alone greenlight the exorbitant budget, felt like scaling Everest barefoot.
