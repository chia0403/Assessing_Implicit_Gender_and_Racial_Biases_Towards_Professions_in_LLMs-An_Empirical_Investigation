Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quincy's office, blurring the neon glow of the pawn shop across the street into an abstract watercolor. Bart sighed, pushing a stray lock of his greying hair back from his forehead. The phone on his desk remained stubbornly silent, its plastic casing reflecting the gloomy light filtering through the blinds. It was Tuesday, which meant it should have been "Senior Savings Day" at Quincy Insurance, but even the promise of discounted premiums wasn't enticing enough to draw in customers today.

Bart gazed out at the desolate street scene, his reflection superimposed over the rain-streaked window. He wasn't a young man anymore - fifty-five years old and feeling every one of them. His once sharp suit was creased and faded, mirroring the decline of his business. Quincy Insurance had been a family legacy for three generations, but Bart feared he might be the last. 


This wasn't how he envisioned things ending. He'd dreamt of expanding the agency, hiring assistants, maybe even opening a second office. Instead, he was drowning in paperwork, fielding calls from disgruntled clients, and battling a relentless sense of stagnation.  But today, something felt different. A restless energy buzzed beneath his skin, a feeling that something was about to change. And then, just as the thought crossed his mind, the phone finally rang, shattering the oppressive silence.
