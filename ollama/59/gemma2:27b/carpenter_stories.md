The morning mist clung stubbornly to the towering redwoods, blurring their edges into ghostly sentinels guarding Mendocino's forgotten backroads. Elias Blackwood, his calloused hands gripping a steaming mug of coffee, surveyed the scene from his porch. Sunlight, still hesitant, filtered through the damp air, casting an ethereal glow on the weathered planks of his workshop.

Elias was a man carved from the same wood he sculpted: rough around the edges, but undeniably strong and steadfast. His workshop, nestled amidst a tangle of ferns and wildflowers, was a testament to his craft - the air heavy with the scent of sawdust and linseed oil, tools hanging in precise order on the walls like ancient talismans. Today, he faced a peculiar commission: a clock for a reclusive artist living deep within the redwood forest, a clock that, according to the whispered rumors swirling around Mendocino, was meant to capture time itself.
