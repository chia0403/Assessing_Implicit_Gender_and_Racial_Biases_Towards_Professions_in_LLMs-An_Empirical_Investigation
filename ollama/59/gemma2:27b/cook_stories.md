The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and simmering garlic, a familiar comfort to Beatrice "Bea" Clementine, head chef of The Rusty Spoon. Rain lashed against the warped glass windows of her tiny kitchen, blurring the neon glow of the diner sign across the street. It was 2:00 am, the witching hour for cooks like Bea who found solace in the solitude and rhythm of late-night prep.  She hummed a tuneless melody as she expertly diced carrots, their bright orange contrasting sharply against the worn wooden countertop. Tonight, however, the usual calm was disrupted by a gnawing unease. 

The diner's back door creaked open, startling Bea. She spun around, a heavy cleaver gripped tight in her hand, adrenaline pumping through her veins.  Standing silhouetted in the doorway was a figure shrouded in shadow, their face obscured by the gloom. The only sound was the relentless drumming of rain against the corrugated iron roof.
