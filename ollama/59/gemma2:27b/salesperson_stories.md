The humid Miami air hung thick as Elara Castillo adjusted her scarlet lipstick in the reflection of the chrome elevator doors. Her tailored turquoise suit, chosen specifically to complement the vibrant hues of South Beach, clung to her curves like a second skin. Today was a make-or-break day. The penthouse suite overlooking the turquoise ocean held the key to her biggest sale yet - convincing Mr. Alessandro Bellini, a notoriously difficult art collector, to invest in her client's avant-garde sculpture exhibit. Elara took a deep breath, the salty air mingling with the scent of jasmine from the lobby's floral arrangement, and pressed the button for the 25th floor. A symphony of nerves and ambition swelled within her. This wasn't just another sale; it was her chance to prove herself in a world dominated by men.
