Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, each drop a miniature hammer against the ancient glass. The scent of damp paper and leather mingled with the faint aroma of cinnamon emanating from Eleanor Blackwood's forgotten teacup. Eleanor, a woman whose silver hair mirrored the streaks in her beloved tomes, sighed and pushed back a stray lock that had escaped its bun.

The library was eerily quiet tonight, even for a Wednesday. Usually, at least a few patrons would be huddled over dusty volumes or tapping away on laptops amidst the towering shelves. But tonight, only Eleanor's footsteps echoed through the cavernous hall.

Eleanor glanced at the grandfather clock, its hands nearing midnight.  She should be closing up, but something felt amiss. An unsettling hum seemed to vibrate beneath her feet, a discordant note in the symphony of silence. She paused, listening intently. Was it just the wind whistling through the eaves? Or was there something more... something hidden within the labyrinthine depths of the library, waiting to be unearthed?
