Rain lashed against the windows of the gymnasium, mimicking the storm brewing inside Elijah "Eli" Blackwood. The worn rubber of countless basketballs squeaked under his feet as he paced the polished floor, the echo amplified in the cavernous space. He was alone, but the ghost of past seasons lingered: the squeak of sneakers, the thump of dribbles, the roar of the crowd.

This year, however, the stands would remain empty. The school board had cut funding for extracurriculars, effectively dismantling the Hawks basketball program Eli had poured his heart and soul into for the past decade. The familiar scent of sweat and pine cleaner couldn't mask the bitterness that clung to the air like a shroud. 

Eli ran a hand through his greying hair, exhaustion etched on his face. He stared at the faded championship banner hanging crookedly above the court, a stark reminder of past glories now fading into distant memory. But Eli wasn't ready to give up. Not yet.
