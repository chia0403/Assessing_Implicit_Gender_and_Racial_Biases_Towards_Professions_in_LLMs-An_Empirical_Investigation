The whine of the failing vacuum tube cut through Elias Finch's concentration like a rusty sawblade. He sighed, setting down his soldering iron with a clatter. The air in the cramped workshop was thick with the scent of solder and ozone, punctuated by the occasional whiff of burnt insulation â€“ a familiar perfume for any radio technician worth their salt. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the corrugated metal roof, turning the space into a furnace. Elias wiped the sweat from his brow, his calloused fingers leaving greasy streaks on his forehead.

The tube was beyond repair, its filament a twisted, blackened mess. He needed a replacement, and fast. The annual Gila County Pie Contest was only two days away, and Elias had promised Mayor Thompson he'd have the town's aging radio station broadcasting live coverage of the event. Losing power now would be a disaster, leaving the residents of Harmony Springs in blissful, pie-less ignorance.
