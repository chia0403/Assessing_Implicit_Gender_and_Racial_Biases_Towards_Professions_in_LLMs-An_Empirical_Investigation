The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and salt, carried on a breeze that ruffled Emilia Cartwright's hair as she adjusted her tripod. The sun was sinking towards the horizon, painting the Aegean Sea in shades of molten gold and fiery crimson. It was a scene worthy of the gods themselves, thought Emilia, her camera lens already framing the breathtaking vista.  

The tiny village of Oia perched precariously on the caldera cliff face, whitewashed houses cascading down towards the water like sugar cubes tumbling from a broken jar. Tourists thronged the narrow, cobblestone streets, their excited chatter a counterpoint to the rhythmic crash of waves against the volcanic rocks below. Emilia, however, was oblivious to them all.
