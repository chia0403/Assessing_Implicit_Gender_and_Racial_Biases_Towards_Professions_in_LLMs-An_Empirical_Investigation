The neon glow of "Luigi's Pizzeria" reflected off Emilia Rossi's tired face as she navigated the Saturday night rush. The air hung thick with the scent of oregano, garlic, and bubbling cheese. Laughter and conversation battled for dominance over the clinking of forks and the rhythmic whoosh of the pizza oven.  Emilia weaved between tables laden with steaming pies and overflowing beer pitchers, her notepad clutched tightly in one hand. 

She was used to the chaos. Luigi's had been a second home since she was fourteen, bussing tables for extra cash. Now, at twenty-two, she was a seasoned server, navigating orders and personalities with practiced ease. But tonight, something felt different. A restless energy hummed beneath the surface of the usual Friday night frenzy.  

It started when a group of men in sharp suits entered, their eyes scanning the room like hawks before settling on a corner booth. Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that they were more than just hungry diners â€“ their hushed whispers and frequent glances towards the entrance hinted at something else entirely.
