The rooster's crow was lost in the howling wind that tore across Silas Blackwood's fields. It whipped his faded blue overalls against his legs as he trudged towards the barn, each step a struggle against the relentless gusts. The sky above was bruised purple and green, threatening an early storm. Silas squinted, hoping to catch a glimpse of sunlight breaking through the clouds, but there was only the deepening gloom. 

He'd known this spring would be tough. The winter had been long and harsh, leaving the soil stubbornly compacted and the water table low. But today felt different – heavier somehow. A sense of foreboding settled in Silas’ gut, cold and unsettling like a forgotten root cellar on a frosty morning.
