As Mr. Thornton's secretary for the past decade, Eloise had mastered the art of appearing calm and collected even when deadlines loomed like thunderclouds and her boss, a notoriously volatile man, was in one of his moods. Today, however, the impending storm within felt more palpable than usual. A letter lay unopened on her mahogany desk, addressed in elegant cursive that sent shivers down Eloise's spine - an invitation she couldn't bring herself to accept, nor refuse.
