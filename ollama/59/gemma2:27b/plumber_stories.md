Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Agnes Butterfield's plumbing van like angry fists, each thud vibrating through the ancient vehicle's bones. Inside, perched precariously on a stack of leaky pipes, sat Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew. His grease-stained hands nervously fiddled with a wrench, his brow furrowed in concentration as he studied the diagram of Mrs. Henderson's temperamental water heater. The address scrawled on the crumpled invoice – 13 Grimshaw Terrace – seemed to mock him from its position on the dashboard.

Grimshaw Terrace was infamous in Teddy's line of work. A cluster of Victorian houses clinging precariously to the cliffside overlooking the churning grey sea, it boasted more plumbing nightmares than any other street in the seaside town of Whitby.  Teddy swallowed hard, picturing the damp, drafty interiors, the labyrinthine pipework hidden behind crumbling plaster, and the ever-present threat of salt spray corrosion. 


He was starting to regret taking on this job.
