The rain hammered against the attic windowpane, each drop a tiny fist demanding entry into Amelia Blackwood's sanctuary. The room smelled of damp wood, old paper, and the faintest whiff of lavender from the mothballs tucked away in a corner chest. Stacks of books teetered precariously around her writing desk, illuminated by a single, flickering oil lamp.

Amelia chewed on the end of her quill, her brow furrowed in concentration. The words refused to come, as stubborn as the persistent drizzle outside. Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the fog-shrouded moors of Yorkshire, had hit a wall. The plot, once flowing like a crystal stream, had stagnated into a muddy pool. She needed inspiration, a spark to ignite the dying embers of her creativity.
