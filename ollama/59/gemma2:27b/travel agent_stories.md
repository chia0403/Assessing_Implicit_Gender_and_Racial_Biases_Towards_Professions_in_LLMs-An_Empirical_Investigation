The relentless hum of the fluorescent lights above mirrored the thrumming anxiety in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's chest. She chewed on her thumbnail, staring at the overflowing inbox on her computer screen, each unread email a ticking time bomb threatening to explode into another travel nightmare. 

Amelia's travel agency, "Wanderlust & Whimsy," nestled amidst the cobbled streets and charming boutiques of Edinburgh's Old Town, was usually a haven of escapism, filled with the tantalizing scent of exotic spices from guidebooks and the low murmur of dreams being woven into itineraries. But today, it felt like a pressure cooker.

A rogue storm had grounded flights across Europe, leaving her clients stranded in airports, desperately calling for rescue. A honeymoon couple was facing potential disaster in Venice as their gondola reservation vanished without a trace. And then there was Mrs. Henderson, who swore her tour guide in the Himalayas was actually a yeti in disguise (Amelia hadn't believed it until she saw the blurry photograph). 


It was going to be a long day.
