The air hung thick with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass, a peculiar blend that Silas Bartholomew III found both comforting and slightly nauseating. The sun beat down on his tanned neck as he meticulously trimmed the rose bushes lining the gravel path, their crimson blooms vibrant against the manicured green lawn. This was his domain, Ashworth Manor, a sprawling estate with gardens so intricate they resembled living tapestries. For Silas, it wasn't just a job; it was a lifelong calling, inherited from generations of Bartholomew groundskeepers who had tended to these very grounds since the manor's construction in the 1800s. 

But today, something felt different. A palpable tension hummed beneath the usual tranquility. The birdsong seemed subdued, the wind carried an unfamiliar chill, and even the roses appeared to droop slightly, their vibrant petals losing a touch of their luster. As Silas straightened, wiping his brow with a calloused hand, he caught sight of a figure approaching from the shadowy recesses of the ancient oak grove. It was a woman, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, her silhouette strangely elongated in the dappled sunlight. 

Silas hesitated, a prickle of unease running down his spine. Visitors were rare at Ashworth Manor, especially those who chose to arrive unannounced and shrouded in mystery.
