The insistent ping of the fasten seatbelt sign jolted Beatrice "Bea" Delacroix from her daydream. Outside the oval window, the clouds had thickened into a churning mass of grey, mirroring the unease twisting in her stomach.  She smoothed down the crisp navy blue uniform and forced a smile as she navigated the narrow aisle, her trolley bumping against knees and overflowing carry-ons.

The air within the Airbus A320 was thick with tension, a cocktail of apprehension and stale coffee.  Bea couldn't blame them. The storm brewing outside wasn't just meteorological; it felt ominously symbolic, mirroring the turmoil in Bea's own life. This flight, a routine hop from London to Paris, held the weight of a crossroads, a decision she needed to make before landing.
