Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the Bay, shrouding the sleepy coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, gray mist. It was the kind of day that made you want to curl up with a good book and a warm cup of coffee, but for Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a reporter for the local newspaper, it meant one thing: story.

Lexi stood at the edge of the dock, her eyes scanning the water as she pulled out her notebook and pen. She had been investigating rumors of strange occurrences at the old lighthouse on the other side of town, and tonight was supposed to be the night the townspeople would finally come forward with some answers.

The Ravenswood Lighthouse, built in 1850, stood tall and proud on its rocky perch, its light beam cutting through the fog like a slice of gold. But despite its picturesque appearance, Lexi had a feeling that something was off about this place. The locals were tight-lipped, the wind howled through the keeper's quarters like a mournful sigh, and the once-white paint was now peeling and flaking in places.

Lexi took a deep breath of the salty air, her mind racing with possibilities. What was really going on at Ravenswood Lighthouse? And what would she uncover when she finally got to the bottom of it?

With a sense of determination, Lexi tucked her notebook into her bag and set off across the creaking wooden planks of the dock, ready to face whatever secrets lay hidden in the heart of the lighthouse.
