Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The dimly lit parking lot was eerily quiet as Dr. Elena Vasquez stepped out of her sedan and stretched her arms over her head, arching her back to work out a lingering knot in her neck. It had been a long day at the physical therapy clinic where she worked, and all she wanted to do was get home, kick off her shoes, and collapse onto her couch with a good book.

As she gazed up at the rows of worn brick buildings that lined the street, Elena felt a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had grown up in this neighborhood, playing tag on the cracked sidewalks and exploring the abandoned lots that seemed to stretch on forever as a child. Now, as a successful physical therapist in her mid-thirties, she couldn't help but feel a pang of disappointment whenever she came back to visit.

The clinic where she worked was located just off Main Street, within walking distance of Elena's own home. She had spent countless hours driving down this very street, watching the sun rise over the rooftops as she made her way to work each morning. But despite its quaint charm, the neighborhood seemed to be losing its way, slowly being replaced by chain stores and strip malls that seemed to suck all the life out of it.

As Elena stood there, lost in thought, a faint noise caught her attention - the rumble of an engine, followed by the sound of tires crunching on gravel. She turned to see a rusty old truck pulling into the parking lot next door, spewing dust and debris everywhere. The driver, a rugged-looking man with a scruffy beard and a baseball cap, stepped out onto the sidewalk, eyeing Elena's sedan with a mixture of curiosity and suspicion.

"Can I help you?" Elena asked, as the stranger ambled over towards her, his boots scuffling against the pavement.

The man flashed a quick smile, and Elena felt an inexplicable jolt of recognition. There was something about him that seemed familiar - like she had seen him before, even if she couldn't quite place where.

"What brings you to this neck of the woods?" Elena asked, trying to sound nonchalant despite the growing sense of unease that was creeping over her.

The stranger chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Just passing through," he said, his voice low and smooth. "I've been looking for a place to lay low for a while."

Elena's heart skipped a beat as she sensed something in the stranger's words that didn't quite add up. There was more to this man than met the eye - and Elena was determined to find out what it was.
