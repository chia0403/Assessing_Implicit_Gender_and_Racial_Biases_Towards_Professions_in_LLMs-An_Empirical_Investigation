Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Haven gleamed like polished onyx, reflecting the faint glow of streetlights that struggled to pierce the darkness. The once-thriving city square was now a deserted shell of its former self, where the sounds of car horns and chatter were replaced by the relentless patter of raindrops on pavement.

Inside the worn, beige walls of his insurance agency, 32 North Main Street, agent Harrison Everett Jenkins sipped his lukewarm coffee, staring blankly at the stack of unpaid bills in front of him. It was a drizzly Monday morning, and Hank, as he was known to those few close friends he'd made over the years, felt like he was drowning in a sea of despair.

At 42, Harrison Everett Jenkins had spent over two decades selling insurance policies to the good people of New Haven, watching his clients' lives unfold before him. He had seen it all - the triumphs and tragedies, the victories and defeats. But with the economy on shaky ground and competition from big-box agencies on the rise, Hank's once-thriving agency was struggling to stay afloat.

As he rubbed the weariness from his eyes, the faint jingle of the phone breaking the silence snapped him back to reality. It was going to be one of those days.
