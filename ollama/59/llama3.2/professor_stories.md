Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Emilia Elena Vasquez stood at the edge of the rooftop garden, gazing out over the sprawling campus of Ravenswood University. The sun was setting, casting a warm orange glow over the lush greenery and vibrant flowers that lined the balconies and walkways below. As the newly appointed head of the Department of Ancient History, Dr. Vasquez felt a sense of pride and responsibility wash over her.
