Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set over the worn stone walls of Newhaven Prison, casting a deep orange glow over the sprawling complex. The once-majestic fortress now stood as a testament to neglect and decay, its iron gates creaking in the gentle breeze like the sighs of the damned.

Inside, Guardsman Kaelin Thorne stood watch at the entrance to the maximum-security wing, his eyes scanning the darkness for any sign of movement. His gaze lingered on the rows of cells, each one a potential threat waiting to be quelled. The air was thick with the stench of sweat and stale air, and Kaelin's uniform seemed to absorb it like a sponge.

A former soldier from the city's sprawling metropolis, Kaelin had traded his sword for a nightstick and a stern expression when he joined the prison guard force five years ago. Now, at 32, he was one of the most respected – if not feared – guards in the institution. His broad shoulders and imposing presence seemed to brook no argument, and his eyes bore a glint of steel that few could match.

As Kaelin checked the locks on the cells, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The prisoners were quiet tonight, almost too quiet. He knew better than to trust his instincts, but his gut told him this night would be different – and that the darkness beyond the walls of Newhaven Prison held secrets that would soon come crashing down upon them all.
