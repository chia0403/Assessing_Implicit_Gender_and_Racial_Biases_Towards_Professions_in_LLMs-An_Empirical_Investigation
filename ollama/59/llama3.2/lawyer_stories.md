Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The streets were quiet, save for the distant hum of a solitary car driving down Main Street. It was a typical Wednesday evening in late autumn, with the leaves on the trees having long since fallen, leaving behind a crunchy carpet of orange and brown hues.

Alexander, a rising star in the law firm where he worked, had spent the day arguing a contentious case before a skeptical judge. Despite his confidence in his arguments, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off about the outcome. The verdict still lingered in his mind like an open wound, refusing to be soothed by the usual adrenaline rush of victory.

He started the engine and pulled away, leaving behind the familiar sights and sounds of Ravenswood for the night.
