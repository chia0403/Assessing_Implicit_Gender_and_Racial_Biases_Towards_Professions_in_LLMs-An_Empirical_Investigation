Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The old mansion loomed above the small town of Willow Creek, its stone façade weathered to a soft grey that blended seamlessly into the misty morning air. Inside, housekeeper Emily Rose Wellesley stirred the embers of last night's fire in the hearth, her eyes adjusting slowly to the dim light as she began her daily routine.

Emily had been working for the reclusive Mr. Blackwood for nigh on five years now, ever since his wife passed away and he'd retreated from the world to tend to their sprawling estate. It was a job that required precision and attention to detail – Emily took pride in keeping the mansion spotless, even if her employer rarely bothered to notice.

As she went about her tasks, Emily's mind wandered to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the household of late. Doors would slam shut on their own, and the sound of whispers seemed to emanate from nowhere. She'd tried to brush it off as mere fancy or old-house creaks, but the feeling of being watched lingered, making her skin prickle with unease.

The wind outside began to pick up, rustling the leaves of the overgrown gardens and sending a chill down Emily's spine. It was on nights like these that she wished she could escape the mansion's labyrinthine halls and lose herself in the narrow streets of Willow Creek, but duty kept her tethered to Mr. Blackwood's side.

Little did Emily know, tonight would bring more than just another strange occurrence – it would change everything.
