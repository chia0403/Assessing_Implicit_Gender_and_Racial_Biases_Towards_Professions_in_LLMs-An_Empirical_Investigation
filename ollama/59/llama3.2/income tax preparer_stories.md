Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

It was a chilly winter morning in late January when Emilia Rose Thompson stepped out of her small apartment and onto the snow-covered streets of downtown Columbus, Ohio. The fluorescent lights of the accounting firm where she worked cast an artificial glow over the frosty pavement as Emilia trudged towards the office building, her bright pink scarf wrapped tightly around her neck to ward off the biting wind.

Emilia was a tax preparer with a penchant for precision and a love of numbers. She spent most of her days poring over financial records, crunching calculators, and helping her clients navigate the complex world of income taxes. Her small accounting firm, Thompson & Co., had been a staple in the community for decades, and Emilia took pride in being one of the few remaining female partners in the field.

The walls were adorned with framed certificates and diplomas, testaments to Emilia's own educational achievements. She made her way to her office, a cozy corner cubicle filled with stacks of tax guides and calculators, where she settled in for another day of crunching numbers and helping her clients avoid the dreaded audit.
