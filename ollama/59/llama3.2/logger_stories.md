Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. The smell of freshly cut wood and diesel fuel hung in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of pine trees that surrounded the town.

In a small clearing on the outskirts of town, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins was finishing up his shift at the local logging company. Hawk had been working as a logger for over a decade, earning a reputation for being one of the toughest and most reliable men in the business. He stood tall, his broad shoulders and arms a testament to his years of physical labor.

As he locked up the truck and headed back towards town, Hawk's mind was already turning to the next day's work. The logging company had just received a new contract to harvest a large tract of land on the outskirts of town, and Hawk was looking forward to getting out into the woods again.

But as he walked, Hawk couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He'd heard rumors that some folks in town were acting strange, whispering among themselves about an old legend that had been thought long buried. Hawk didn't know what to make of it, but his instincts told him that something was brewing in Willow Creek.

As he approached his small cabin on the edge of town, Hawk's phone buzzed with a text from his best friend and fellow logger, Jesse. "Hey man, you free to meet up at the bar tonight? I've got some info about the new contract."
