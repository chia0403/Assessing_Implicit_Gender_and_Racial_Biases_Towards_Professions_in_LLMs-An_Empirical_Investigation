As the sun set over the bustling streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, Flight Attendant Akira Yoshino stood in the dimly lit arrivals lounge, sipping on a lukewarm coffee and gazing out at the crowded concourse. The hum of foreign chatter and the wail of departing planes created a cacophony that was both soothing and overwhelming to her sensitive ears.

At 28 years old, Akira had been working for All Nippon Airways for five years, traveling to destinations from Osaka to Seoul and everywhere in between. She loved the freedom that came with flying, but she couldn't shake the feeling of disconnection that came with being a ghost among humans – a constant observer of lives unfolding around her.

Akira's own life was far from exciting. Her parents had passed away when she was just 19, leaving her with a modest inheritance and no family to speak of. She'd always dreamed of traveling the world, but after college, reality set in, and she took a steady-paying job as a flight attendant to support herself.

As she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time that evening, Akira's thoughts turned to the long-haul flight she was scheduled to work tomorrow – Los Angeles bound. The thought of crossing the Pacific Ocean, leaving the chaos of Tokyo behind, and experiencing the bright lights of LA was almost enough to counteract the exhaustion that had been weighing her down all week.

Just then, a gentle voice interrupted her reverie. "Excuse me, is this seat taken?"
