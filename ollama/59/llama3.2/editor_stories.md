Here's a potential story opening and setting:

In the sleepy coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, where the misty dawn air clung to the skin like a damp shroud, Emilia Faye Winters sat hunched over her desk, staring out at the grey sea through the grimy window of her office. The worn wooden floor creaked beneath her feet as she shifted in her chair, her eyes scanning the shelves upon shelves of dog-eared paperbacks and faded manuscripts that lined the walls of her cramped editing room.

As a freelance editor for the town's struggling literary magazine, Emilia had grown accustomed to the isolation and quiet rhythms of Ravenswood's daily life. But on this particular morning, something felt off. Perhaps it was the way the sea seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for something to break the surface. Or maybe it was the faint scent of smoke that lingered in the air, like a whispered secret.

Whatever it was, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that today would be different. That today would bring more than just another day's work and a decent cup of coffee from the local café downstairs. Today might bring something – or someone – that would change everything.
