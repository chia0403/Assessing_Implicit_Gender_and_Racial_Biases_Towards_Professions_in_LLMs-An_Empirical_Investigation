Here's a story opening and setting for you:

**Opening**

The sun was setting over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and weathered buildings. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, exhaust fumes, and worn leather. Inside "McKinney's Garage," a lone figure stood elbow-deep in engine grease, his hands moving with practiced ease as he disassembled a troublesome transmission.

**Setting**

Oakdale was a small town nestled in the heart of rural America. The kind of place where everyone knew everyone else's name, and the local diner served as the town's gathering spot. Main Street was lined with worn storefronts: the hardware store, the gas station, and McKinney's Garage, which had been a staple of the community for over 40 years.

The town was surrounded by rolling hills, fields of golden wheat and corn stretching as far as the eye could see. A meandering river ran along the eastern edge of Oakdale, its gentle voice a soothing background hum to the bustle of small-town life.

For generations, McKinney's had been the go-to shop for Oakdale's residents, fixing cars, trucks, and even the occasional farm tractor.

Little did he know, however, that tonight would bring more than just another ordinary evening...
