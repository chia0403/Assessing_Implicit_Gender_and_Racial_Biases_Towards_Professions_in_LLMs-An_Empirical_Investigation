Here's a potential story opening:

As she rang up the last customer of the evening at her family's diner, Emilia Rose Thompson gazed out the window at the rain-soaked streets of Willow Creek, a small town nestled in the heart of rural America. The neon lights of the diner cast a gaudy glow over the deserted sidewalk, casting long shadows behind the parked cars and trucks that lined the street like sentinels. Emilia's mind wandered from the mundane task at hand, her thoughts drifting to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the town for weeks - the missing livestock, the broken fences, and the eerie feeling of being watched by unseen eyes.

Outside, the wind howled through the empty streets like a restless animal, causing the old diner's sign creak and groan in protest. Emilia shivered, despite the warmth of the diner's fluorescent lights, and quickened her pace as she tallied up the day's earnings. It was going to be one of those nights.

How does this sound?
