Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Ravenswood, nestled deep in the heart of rural Oregon. The streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to find shelter from the rain. In a small, cluttered shop on Main Street, Electrician's Apprentice Elijah Jameson huddled over his workbench, surrounded by tangled wires and discarded tools. The soft hum of his work lamp cast an eerie glow over the space as he wrestled with a stubborn electrical panel.

Elijah had just finished a long day of working for his father's electrical contracting business, and was taking on some personal projects in his spare time to hone his skills. He was determined to become one of the best electricians in Ravenswood, just like his dad before him. But as he worked, Elijah couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a nagging sense of unease that had been growing inside him for weeks.

Just then, the doorbell above the shop's entrance jangled loudly, snapping Elijah out of his focus. He looked up to see a tall, imposing figure standing in the doorway, shaking the rain from their coat. The stranger's eyes scanned the room, locking onto Elijah with an unnerving intensity. "I'm looking for someone," they said, their voice low and gravelly. "Someone named Elijah Jameson."

Elijah felt a shiver run down his spine as he met the stranger's gaze. Who was this person, and what did they want?
