Here's a potential story opening:

Detective Emilia Rose Thompson stepped out of her cruiser and onto the rain-soaked streets of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. The neon lights of the bars and clubs along 12th Avenue reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the dark alleys and cramped side streets. It was late on a Tuesday night, just before midnight, and the city was alive with the hum of revelers and the distant thrum of music.

As she pulled her jacket tighter against the chill in the air, Emilia's eyes scanned the deserted street. She had been called to the scene of a violent disturbance at the popular nightclub, 'The Raven', just hours before. The club's owner, a reclusive millionaire named Marcus Blackwood, was rumored to be hosting an exclusive private party for Seattle's elite, and rumors were circulating that tensions between Blackwood and one of his guests had boiled over into violence.

Emilia's partner, Detective Liam Connor, stood beside her, eyeing the entrance to The Raven with a mixture of curiosity and concern. "You think this is going to be a long night, Em?" he asked, voice low and even.

"I've got a feeling," she replied, her eyes never leaving the club's logo emblazoned on the door.
