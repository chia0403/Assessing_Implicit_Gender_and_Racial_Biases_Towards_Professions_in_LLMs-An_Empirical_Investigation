Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven were always at their most unforgiving in the early morning hours. As the sun struggled to rise above the horizon, casting a pale glow over the city, Edwin Fletcher stood huddled beneath the awning of his drafting shop. He rubbed the chill from his hands, watching as the droplets on the awning's metal ribs blended with the mist that rose from the nearby canal.

Edwin, a 35-year-old drafting worker, had been waiting for this day to start for what felt like an eternity. His latest project, a complex blueprint for a new high-rise development, was finally due to be submitted to the city council. The thought of meeting his deadline and collecting the hefty paycheck that came with it sent a surge of adrenaline through his veins.

As he checked the time on his pocket watch – a gift from his late grandmother, which still ticked away with reassuring regularity – Edwin's mind began to wander to the long hours ahead. He would spend the next several days pouring over lines and curves, ensuring every detail was precise and accurate. It was work he loved, but also work that consumed him.

With a deep breath, Edwin pushed off from the awning and stepped into the chill of the morning air. The city was already stirring – pedestrians hurried past his shop, sipping coffee and muttering to themselves as they went about their day. Edwin smiled to himself, knowing he had a front-row seat to it all, if only for the few hours he spent hunched over his drafting table.
