Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Ashwood gleamed like polished onyx, reflecting the faint glow of streetlights that cast long shadows across the pavement. Inside the small office building where Elara Mae Thompson spent her days hunched over spreadsheets and financial ledgers, the air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and worn paper. As the sun began to set on another unremarkable day, Elara's gaze drifted from the stack of invoices and receipts on her desk to the faded photograph tacked to the edge of the window frame. It was a picture of her mother, taken just before she vanished without warning ten years ago.

Elara's eyes felt heavy with fatigue as she pushed aside the dusty curtain that separated her workspace from the rest of the office, revealing the worn linoleum floor and the narrow corridor beyond. She had always been the diligent one, the bookkeeper who kept the finances of Ashwood's modest businesses in order, but tonight, something about the flickering fluorescent lights above seemed to hum with a discordant energy that made her skin prickle.

Little did Elara know, this ordinary evening was about to unravel into an extraordinary night, one that would propel her back into the world she'd been trying so desperately to leave behind.
