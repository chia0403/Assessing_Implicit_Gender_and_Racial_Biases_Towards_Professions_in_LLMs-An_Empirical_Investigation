The air hung heavy with stale coffee and the smell of yesterday's donuts, a symphony of scents that punctuated Amelia’s shift at “Sunrise Corner.”  She stood behind the counter of this bustling little diner in a forgotten corner of Chicago, the faded red paint on the walls a testament to countless years. Amelia, all elbows and nervous energy, felt more like a ghost than a cashier, flitting from order to customer, her name tag silently proclaiming "Amelia." 

It was just another Wednesday morning, but for Amelia, it had already begun to feel like the end of the world.  The city was in its usual chaotic hum – cars honking, sirens wailing, people rushing by – all a blur behind the thick glass windows. But even with her own anxieties rising like the steam from the coffee machine, one customer remained trapped in her mind's eye: Mrs. Perrault. 

Mrs. Perrault, whose name Amelia had been given, was never mentioned, only whispered in hushed tones by the other cashiers. Her eyes – cold and distant – followed everyone who passed by like a watchful hawk. And today, she seemed to have arrived with a particular air of malice.  Amelia's heart hammered against her ribs as she waited for Mrs. Perrault to make her move.
