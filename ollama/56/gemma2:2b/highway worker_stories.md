##  The Concrete Jungle

**Opening:**  Dust devils danced in the relentless heat, swirling between the towering concrete pillars that formed the skeletal structure of the new overpass. The air hung thick with diesel exhaust and the scent of fresh asphalt, barely discernible under the perpetual haze of a summer afternoon.  A lone figure, hunched under the shade of a battered steel gantry, shifted his weight from one foot to the other. His name was Jasper Blackwood, and he'd spent more than half his life working this concrete jungle, laying down the roads that crisscrossed the sprawling metropolis. 

**Setting:** A vast highway construction site in Phoenix, Arizona. The setting is dominated by a massive overpass being built, flanked by towering cranes, earthmovers, and a symphony of beeping warning lights.  A sweltering desert landscape stretches to the horizon, punctuated by a smattering of cacti and scrub brush.
