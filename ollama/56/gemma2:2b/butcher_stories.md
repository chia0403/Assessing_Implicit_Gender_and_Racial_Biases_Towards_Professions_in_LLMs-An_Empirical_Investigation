The morning mist hung heavy in the air over Millford's Grove, clinging to the cobblestone streets like forgotten dreams. It was that kind of day where even the sparrows seemed content to roost on high-pitched branches, their chirps muffled by the thick fog. Inside "The Stag & Cleaver," the aroma of woodsmoke and sizzling bacon battled against a tang of salt from the curing room in the back. Bartholomew “Bart” Thorne, his hands gnarled and worn like the ancient oak standing sentinel outside, surveyed the bustling scene. A symphony of clangs and whispers filled the air as customers shuffled through the shop, their faces illuminated by the soft glow of lanterns hanging precariously from rough-hewn beams.  


The butcher's block stood tall in Bart's corner of the world, a testament to generations of Thorne’s family dedication to the craft. For almost forty years, he’d carved his life and legacy into the meat he handled, each cut and slice imbued with an artistry that had earned him a reputation as one of Millford's finest.  But lately, whispers of something deeper stirring in the fog outside echoed in Bart's heart like a restless hound dog, urging him to delve into the hidden secrets of his family legacy.
