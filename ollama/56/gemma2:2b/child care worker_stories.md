Rain hammered against the windowpanes, each drop exploding like miniature fireworks on the glass. Inside "Sunshine Cottage", the little ones were in their usual flurry: giggling over imaginary teacups, building precarious towers with blocks, and making faces at the reflection in Mr. Jenkins' oversized sunglasses.  Evelyn, her name a testament to her cheerful disposition, wiped down spilled juice off a table adorned with hand-painted rainbows. Evelyn, 25 years old but with the kind of weary smile only someone who has seen too many childhood tantrums could possess, sighed. She wouldn’t trade it for the world. But sometimes, the world felt like a little bit too much.

The setting: Sunshine Cottage, a quaint bungalow nestled on a quiet street in Maple Creek, a sleepy town where time seemed to move at a glacial pace. The cottage was more than just a childcare center; it was a sanctuary of laughter, mud puddles, and crayons bursting with color. Evelyn’s life revolved around its walls - cleaning up sticky fingerprints, comforting toddlers through their first cries, and witnessing the spark of discovery in her charges' eyes as they learned to walk and talk. 

But tonight, the usual quiet hum of life felt different; a tension was creeping into the air. A storm raged outside, but Evelyn could sense something else brewing inside the cottage, something unsettling and unfamiliar. And it was all centered around the arrival of a new family.
