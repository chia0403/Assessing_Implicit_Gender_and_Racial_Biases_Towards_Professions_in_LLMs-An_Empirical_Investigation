The air in the sterile hospital hallways clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin – thin, almost metallic, smelling faintly of disinfectant and old hope. His brown eyes scanned the faces of patients lined up for their consultations, each one a unique puzzle piece fitting into the larger picture he was trying to understand: their health, their fears, their stories.  He wasn't just seeing bodies; he was deciphering lives. Elias Thorne, PA-C at Mercy General Hospital, felt like a silent observer in the grand symphony of life and death that played out within these walls every day.

It was 3 p.m., twilight bleeding into the shadows cast by late afternoon sunbeams flooding through the windows. His patient list for today was long - a mix of chronic pain sufferers seeking relief, young mothers battling postpartum depression, and elderly patients with advanced dementia – but one name stood out: Ms. Amelia Green. She was a regular at the clinic, her once vibrant eyes now dulled by years of loneliness and hardship.  Her case had been on his mind since the last consultation.
