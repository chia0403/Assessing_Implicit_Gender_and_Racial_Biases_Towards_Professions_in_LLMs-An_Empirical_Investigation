Rain lashed against the frosted glass windows, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her.  Across the worn oak desk, sprawled beneath a flickering fluorescent bulb, lay the body of Marcus Riley, his face twisted into an eternal grimace – a victim of a meticulously orchestrated death.

The air, thick with the weight of unanswered questions and secrets, seemed to vibrate with an almost palpable tension.  Evelyn, ever the unwavering beacon in a sea of shadows, steeled herself for the battle ahead – for this wasn’t just another case; it was about unraveling the threadbare veil of reality and confronting the face of darkness itself.
