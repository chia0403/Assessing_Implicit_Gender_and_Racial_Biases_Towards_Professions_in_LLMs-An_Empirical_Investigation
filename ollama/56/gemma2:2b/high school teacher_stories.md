Rain hammered against the classroom windowpanes, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Mrs. Evelyn Thorne's thoughts. Outside, the storm raged – an unruly torrent of wind and downpour that seemed to mirror the chaos brewing in her own heart. It was 10:30 p.m., lights out for everyone except her. The only sound besides the tempestuous weather was the incessant ticking of the clock on the wall, each second a hammer blow against her mounting frustration.  She glanced at the overflowing folder on her desk – another day, another mountain of overdue assignments.

Tonight was no different, and she found herself wondering if even the most fervent flames could burn through this growing darkness.
