The midday sun beat down on Auberon Blackwood's weathered face as he stood before the imposing gate of Castle Hemlock. His turquoise scarf flapped in the gentle breeze, mirroring the nervous flutter in his stomach. This wasn't just any castle; this was the legendary residence of Lord Blackwood, a figure so shrouded in mystery that whispers of his power and cruelty echoed through the valleys for centuries.  Auberon, known affectionately as "Aube" by friends and locals alike, was no ordinary tour guide â€“ he possessed an uncanny ability to sense the lingering echoes of the past in these very stones. This evening, he would lead a group of eager tourists on a spectral exploration of the castle's depths, their footsteps echoing with each whispered legend from his own childhood. 

Auberon adjusted the worn leather strap of his backpack, "Welcome, everyone, to the shadows of Castle Hemlock!" he boomed out, his voice carrying over the hushed anticipation of the group.  As they approached the massive oak doors, a shiver ran down Auberon's spine. He knew these walls held secrets more ancient than time itself; secrets that he himself had yet to unlock fully. Tonight was the night he would finally confront them, or be consumed by their silence.
