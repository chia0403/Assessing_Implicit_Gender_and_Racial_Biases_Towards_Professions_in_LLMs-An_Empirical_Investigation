Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the tumultuous storm brewing inside her own head.  The air in the room, usually warm and inviting thanks to the crackling fire in the hearth, was now thick with tension and unspoken words. Her patient, a young man named David, sat opposite her on the worn leather armchair, his eyes downcast as if he'd swallowed lead. 

Evelyn knew this session was about more than just Davidâ€™s recent struggles with work-life balance. There was something deeper, something that felt like an undertow tugging at their understanding of each other. The storm in his heart mirrored the one raging outside, and the weight of it all rested heavily on Evelyn's shoulders, a familiar burden she carried as an empathetic counselor navigating the labyrinthine paths of human emotion. 

Outside, the city hummed with its usual chaotic energy. But inside her office, the clock seemed to be ticking slower than ever before; every second felt measured and agonizingly slow.  Evelyn had been practicing counseling for years, but even she couldn't decipher David's unspoken plea for understanding. The question of "why" hung heavy between them, a silent echo of the storm raging both inside and out.
