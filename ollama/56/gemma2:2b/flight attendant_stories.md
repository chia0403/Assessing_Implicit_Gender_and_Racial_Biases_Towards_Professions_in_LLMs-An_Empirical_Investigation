Tonight, though, there was something different, an unsettling energy that hummed beneath the surface, a silent storm brewing in the cabin's steel belly. 

The engine's gentle purr resonated through the floor, a familiar lullaby that usually brought her peace. Now, it felt more like a warning whistle, amplifying the growing unease spreading across the passengers' faces, mirroring the unsettling shift in the desert’s vast, silent expanse.
