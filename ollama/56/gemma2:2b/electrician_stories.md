##  The Flicker

**Setting:** The storm raged outside, its fury mirroring the chaos inside Thomas "Tommy" O'Connell’s workshop. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, a constant drumming that amplified the groans of old wood as it shifted under the weight of wind and water. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt wires - remnants of his last job, where he'd battled an electrical fire at a century-old mansion on Elm Street. 

Tommy adjusted his worn leather cap and wiped a damp patch from his forehead.  He was no stranger to the elements. He'd spent years working under the unforgiving gaze of lightning and wind, navigating the maze of power lines that crisscrossed the city like veins in an aging giant. But this storm felt different - a palpable tension crackled through the air. Not just from the electricity himself. 

He surveyed his workshop – a cluttered haven where wires coiled and spark-jumped around him, creating a miniature cityscape of potential energy. His toolbox lay open on the workbench, its contents spilling out like forgotten memories:  rusted screwdrivers, chipped wrenches, and a battered set of pliers - all tools that had witnessed countless electrical marvels and misfortunes. 

But tonight was different. Tonight felt…charged, as if the storm itself was seeping into his bones.  A sudden flash of lightning illuminated the room, momentarily blinding Tommy before settling on the flickering light of his workbench lamp. His eyes focused on a small circuit board lying forgotten in the corner - its once-vibrant green circuitry now a muted grey. 


**Main Character:** Thomas "Tommy" O'Connell - A seasoned electrician with weathered hands and a quick wit, he knew more about electricity than any man alive. But tonight, even his expertise felt insufficient as he stared at the board, its unyielding mystery leaving him feeling lost in the storm's swirling chaos.
