The stale air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear as Elara "El" Blackwood meticulously drew blood from Mrs. Henderson's trembling arm.  Elara was small, even for a woman, but her movements were calm and precise, each step in her routine practiced to perfection. With every pinch, she managed a gentle smile, an effort to reassure the elderly patient whose face was etched with worry. 

The tiny office, tucked away on the second floor of the Mercy General Clinic, felt both intimate and isolated. Outside, bustling city traffic rumbled beneath the windowpanes. Inside, it was just Elara, Mrs. Henderson, a few medical instruments, and the ever-present hum of the small laboratory attached to the room where vials of blood were meticulously labeled before being sent off for testing. The quiet routine of her work offered a strange sense of comfort in this chaotic world. But something was different today. The air felt heavier, thicker than usual.  And Elara couldn't shake off the feeling that something, lurking just beyond the edges of her vision, was watching her.
