The neon green "Plumber's Paradise" sign buzzed insistently above Clayton 'Chuck' Barnes' head as he sat on his rusty porch swing. A storm had rolled in just minutes ago, unleashing a torrent of rain that hammered the corrugated roof of his small home, turning the usual salty air into a thick, fetid swamp.  Chuck ran a calloused hand through his unruly brown hair, sighing. 

It wasn't supposed to be like this. The life he’d built after leaving the city was simple -  he’d own the diner, work on leaky pipes and clogged drains in the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven, and raise his son, Tommy, who looked just as mischievous as Chuck did when he was a young boy. But life had a way of throwing curveballs, especially for a man who never thought himself a lucky one. 

The old crank-start generator sputtered to life, groaning like an overworked bear. A sudden flash from the storm illuminated the street in jagged streaks of light and shadow. The phone on his counter vibrated with another call. It wasn't even lunchtime yet.  Chuck glanced at it, gritting his teeth as he realized what he was facing - a problem that had him running late for breakfast. 

**Setting:** A quaint coastal town called Oakhaven, Maine, with narrow streets, cozy cafes, and an air of quiet nostalgia. There's a strong sense of community here, where everyone knows their neighbors, and every home has a unique story to tell.


**Main Character:** Clayton 'Chuck' Barnes, the titular plumber, a man of gruff charm and honest work ethic, struggling to find the balance between his own ambition and his son's needs in this idyllic yet challenging small town.
