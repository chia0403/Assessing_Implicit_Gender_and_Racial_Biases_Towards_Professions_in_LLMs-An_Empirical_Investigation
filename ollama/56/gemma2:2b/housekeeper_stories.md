##  The Whispering Walls

**Setting:** A sprawling Victorian manor in rural Gloucestershire, England.  Built in the 1880s by a wealthy industrialist, it now stands silent under an overcast sky. Years of neglect have left it with peeling paint and dusty velvet curtains. The once vibrant tapestry of life within has been replaced by quiet decay and lingering shadows.

**Main Character:** Agatha Thornewood.  A woman of steely resolve and tired patience, Agatha is the sole remaining employee after years of managing the manor's upkeep. At 57, her hair is streaked silver, but her eyes still hold a youthful fire as she navigates the labyrinthine halls and weathered staircases. 

**Opening:** "The air here is thick with secrets," Agatha muttered to herself as she straightened a particularly stubborn batch of antique lace curtains. The whispers in these walls were old and familiar â€“ echoes of forgotten laughter, hushed arguments, and a persistent undercurrent of something deeply unsettling. As she dusted the intricate carvings on the mantlepiece, a single, tattered photograph caught her eye.  It depicted a woman with fiery red hair and piercing blue eyes, standing proudly beside a smiling man in a military uniform. A pang of longing stirred within Agatha. She had never seen this woman before; yet, something about the picture tugged at her like an old memory.

**Note:** The story opens with a sense of mystery and intrigue. It introduces the character of Agatha, highlighting her role as a caretaker of the manor's fading grandeur.  The photograph provides a spark of curiosity and suggests that there may be more to the house's history than meets the eye.
