The scent of acetone hung thick in the air, mingling with the sweet, heady fragrance of lavender hand cream. This was Aurelia's haven, her little corner of the city where chaos melted into calm – or at least it did most days. But today, the usual hum of nail polish drying and gossip over manicures felt strangely off-key. The rhythmic tap of her foot against the floor seemed to slow down, mirroring the muted whispers escaping the mouths of the other salon employees. Aurelia’s gaze drifted across the room, landing on her reflection in the shiny chrome of a nail polisher. 

She was Aurelia Delacroix, and she was no stranger to dealing with a whirlwind life.  It had started years ago, a quiet escape from the city's chaos into a cozy haven where she could transform ordinary hands into work of art. Her salon, "The Artful Hands," was her canvas – each manicured nail a stroke on a masterpiece. But today, something felt different. The usual buzz of anticipation for Friday night’s launch event for her latest design - the "Moonbeam" collection - seemed to be replaced by an unsettling silence. 


**Setting:** A small, cozy salon called “The Artful Hands” located in a quiet corner of a bustling city. The walls are painted in soothing pastels, and the chairs are upholstered in plush velvet. Soft jazz music plays faintly in the background.  
 
 **Main Character:** Aurelia Delacroix - A talented manicurist with a passion for transforming ordinary hands into works of art.  She's witty, observant, and deeply empathetic, with a secret that weighs heavily on her heart.
