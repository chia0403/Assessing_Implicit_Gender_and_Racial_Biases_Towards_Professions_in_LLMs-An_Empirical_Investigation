The wind howled through the skeletal remains of the ancient Douglas firs, whistling a mournful tune like an old man's forgotten song.  Even in November, the air held the bite of winter, frost creeping down the rough cedar siding of his cabin with unnerving speed. It was here, on the edge of the vast, snow-dusted mountain range that swallowed up the sunrise and sunset in a symphony of gray and purple, that Elias Thorne lived - a man whose life had been as rugged and unforgiving as the land he worked. 

Elias, his weathered face creased with more lines than the ancient trees he felled, was a logger by trade.  His hands, calloused and strong from years spent wrestling logs into submission, were also capable of carving intricate patterns on small wooden toys for his granddaughter, a girl named Lily whose laughter filled the cabin like the chime of a wind chime in the breeze. 

But tonight, the silence felt different, heavy with an unspoken tension that made Eliasâ€™s gut clench as he stared out at the endless horizon. A storm was brewing, and it wasn't just nature's wrath he could feel; there were shadows flitting across his periphery, whispers of a presence in the trees that sent shivers down his spine.
