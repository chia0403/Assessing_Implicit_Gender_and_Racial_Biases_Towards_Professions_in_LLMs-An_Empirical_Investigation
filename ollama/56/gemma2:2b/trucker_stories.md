The desert stretched before Bartholomew "Bart"  McAllister like an uncaring expanse of sandpapery heat and endless horizons. His rig, 'Lady Luck', hummed its tired tune beneath him as he navigated the cracked asphalt ribbon that snaked across the Nevada landscape. Bart wasn't a man of much chatter, but even the stale air in his cab seemed to crackle with an unspoken tension. The miles rolled by like a slow-motion river current, each mile blurring into the next, until all he had left were the sunbaked asphalt and a nagging sense of urgency that wouldn't quit. He was scheduled for a delivery in Las Vegas tomorrow, but something felt off about this particular run; an unsettling feeling like the desert itself was breathing down his neck, watching him.

Bart's weathered face, lined deeper than the canyons he traversed, crinkled into a frown as he glanced at the clock on the dashboard - 2:17 AM. Two hours till sunrise and still no sign of civilization.  The only company he had were the phantom memories of his late wife and the ghost-like echo of his dog's playful yelps from his childhood, a faint, persistent hum in the silence. He took a swig of lukewarm coffee from the battered thermos - a routine that offered little comfort, only an unsettling sense of isolation in this vast emptiness.
