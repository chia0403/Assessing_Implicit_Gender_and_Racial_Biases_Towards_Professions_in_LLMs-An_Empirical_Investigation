## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  A crumbling, Victorian-era manor nestled deep within the outskirts of a bustling city. Rain pattered against the boarded windows of the decaying mansion, each drop echoing like tiny drums in the suffocating stillness. 

**Character:**  Amelia “Amy” Nightingale, a sharp and driven reporter with a penchant for uncovering hidden truths and a nose for scandal. Her trench coat, worn and faded with years of chasing down leads, felt more like a cloak than mere attire as she stood at the front steps. A single, weathered newspaper lay crumpled in her hand, its headline screaming "The Blackwood Legacy: Mystery & Mayhem."

Amy had always been drawn to stories shrouded in mystery, tales that whispered through history's cracks and promised untold secrets.  This manor, known locally as the "Shadow House," was a notorious enigma – the subject of hushed whispers amongst residents who claimed the very walls held their own anxieties captive.

“Ghosts are just misunderstood souls,” Amy muttered to herself, her eyes flickering towards the darkened windows. “And I'm here to find out what they’re trying to tell me.”

The door creaked open, a wisp of stale air and the scent of mildew swirling around her.  A thin figure emerged from the shadows.  His face was masked by a fedora, his voice a gravelly baritone that echoed through the cavernous halls. 

“Ms. Nightingale,” he rasped. “You seem determined.”
