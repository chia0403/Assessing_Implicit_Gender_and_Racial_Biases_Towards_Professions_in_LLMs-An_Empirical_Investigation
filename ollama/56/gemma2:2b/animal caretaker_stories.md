The wind whipped Amelia "Em" Finch’s hair across her face, whipping through the open barn doors like a wild stallion's mane. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, each drop a tiny explosion against the already-damp wood. The air was heavy with the scent of hay and damp earth, a potent aroma that always stirred Em’s childhood memories of her grandfather’s tales, stories about animals who spoke in whispers and winds, as if they held secrets that only she could understand. 

Em's boots crunched on the muddy floor as she surveyed the stable, its wooden stalls dark and damp even beneath the harsh overhead lights. A thin layer of frost clung to the hay bales, turning the usual dusty browns into a palette of pale greys.  Her gaze fell upon the two largest stalls. The one at the far end housed Bruno, the gentle giant of a Clydesdale, whose deep mahogany coat was dappled with silver flecks like moonlight on snow. But it wasn't Bruno’s size that had her heart racing tonight; it was his new companion, the equally massive but volatile black stallion, Shadow. 

Em’s calloused fingers ran lightly over the steel mesh of Shadow’s stall door. He stood still, an immense shadow against the fading light, a coiled spring of power waiting for the right moment to be unleashed.  It was a dance she knew all too well - the delicate balance between kindness and understanding, between respect and trepidation, that ran through every fiber of her being as she tended the animals under her care at Willow Creek Farm.
