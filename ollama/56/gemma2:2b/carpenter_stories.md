The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cluttered workshop of Elias Thorne, wood dust swirling like ghosts in its wake. The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and old paint, a familiar aroma that both comforted and challenged Elias, who ran his calloused hand over the smooth surface of a half-finished oak table. 

Elias Thorne, known throughout the town as "El" to those who knew him best, wasn't a man easily rattled.  He’d spent years in this workshop, crafting furniture from sturdy timber and shaping dreams into reality with his bare hands. His shop stood on the edge of Pinewood Creek, nestled against a sprawling willow tree whose branches swayed gently in the breeze. 

But today was different. A storm was brewing over the horizon, and Elias couldn't shake off a strange unease that gnawed at him like a hungry wolf. The wind howled, its mournful cry seeming to echo the growing tension within his own chest. He glanced towards the window, watching as dark clouds rolled in faster than he could even process.  He needed to finish something tonight, and fast – but not just any task. Tonight, he was going to face a challenge that felt both exhilarating and terrifying: building something bigger than himself, a monument to his skill, and a testament to the strength of what lies within.
