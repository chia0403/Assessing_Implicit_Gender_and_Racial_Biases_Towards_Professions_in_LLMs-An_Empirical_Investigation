Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Smith & Co." as Amelia Price meticulously tallied the day's transactions.  The air inside was thick with the smell of old paper, stale coffee, and an ever-present tension that seemed to hum in the silence punctuated only by the occasional groan of a rusted filing cabinet. It was 1926, Amelia felt like she was trapped in a time warp as her world narrowed down to balancing ledgers and calculating interest rates.  The old ledger sat on her desk, a testament to years of meticulous work: "Smith & Co., Bookkeepers for the Humble and Humbled" - the inscription at the top mocked Amelia's own stifled dreams of writing her own story.  Outside, the storm raged, mirroring the tempest within Amelia's soul as she struggled with a particularly troublesome balance sheet. 


**Setting:** A small, cluttered office in a quiet corner of a bustling city, the year is 1926, during the roaring twenties but shrouded in an old-world charm and a sense of impending change.

**Main Character:** Amelia Price
