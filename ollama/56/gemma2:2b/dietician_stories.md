The aroma of sugar-glazed cinnamon rolls hit Elara Thorne's nostrils before she even stepped into "Sunshine Bakery."  Her stomach growled in protest, her inner monologue battling a wave of guilt alongside a craving for something warm and sweet.  It was an absurdly early Monday morning for such a decadent indulgence â€“ she'd been diligently working through the last of her patient files at home, trying to get ahead on the day's schedule. But this bakery... it always lured her in with its sugary promise. 

Elara worked as a dietitian in a bustling New York City clinic, meticulously charting and analyzing the nutritional journeys of her clients.  She was known for her gentle demeanor and empathetic approach, but even Elara had her weaknesses - especially when confronted with the delicate art of baking. Today, however, she could not ignore the siren call of this small, family-owned bakery. 

The shop was cozy, filled with vintage photographs of smiling families enjoying sunshine-yellow cakes. A handwritten menu adorned one wall, boasting a colorful array of pastries. The familiar sounds of clanging pans and cheerful chatter filled the air as Elara stepped inside, her heels clicking on the worn wooden floorboards. It was just what she needed - a little escape from the sterile white walls of her office and the constant hum of life's demands.
