Rain lashed against the antique windowpane, blurring the already faint light filtering through the grimy panes of the old gallery. Inside, the air was thick with dust motes dancing in the shafts of sunlight that dared pierce the gloom. Evelyn Thorne, her name as much a whisper as it was a title in the city's creative circles, ran her fingertips along the worn leather of her camera case. She had always felt at home in this space; an old Victorian mansion crammed with forgotten stories and echoes of long-dead artists. 

Evelyn wasn't just a photographer; she was a weaver of tales. Not from words, but from light and shadow, capturing moments frozen in time like captured dreams. Tonight, however, the familiar solace felt heavy. The gallery was hosting its annual exhibition, a collection of portraits celebrating the city’s underbelly. This year, the focus was on resilience, on stories whispered between cracked pavements and flickering neon signs – tales that rarely saw the light of day, let alone the pages of a magazine or the silver screen.  

But tonight, she couldn't shake off the unsettling feeling that something was amiss. The usual vibrant energy felt muted, almost suffocated by an unseen weight. Even the familiar melancholy that pervaded the portraits seemed…different. Evelyn looked out the window at the torrential downpour, its rhythm mirroring the unease within her.
