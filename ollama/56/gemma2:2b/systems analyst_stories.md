Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof, each drop sounding like a tiny fist pounding on a giant's chest. Inside the air-conditioned office, Amelia "Amy" Evans, her normally sharp eyes dimmed with fatigue, squinted at the screen displaying a cascading torrent of code. The lines of numbers and symbols blurred before her eyes as her brain wrestled with the intricate logic behind the financial system that underpinned the entire city's infrastructure. 

It had been three days since she'd woken up to this nightmare –  an error in the automated payment system for the public transportation network, triggering a cascading series of failures that threatened to cripple the city. A digital hurricane had swept through the city's financial arteries, and Amy was caught in the eye, trying to understand how to calm it before the storm crashed down on them all. 

The setting was bleak: a dilapidated office building overlooking a run-down industrial park in the heart of San Juan, with its neon glow barely penetrating the heavy clouds that clung stubbornly to the sky. It housed the "City Brain," the very system that Amy worked for, responsible for managing everything from traffic signals and power grids to public transportation and waste management – a city's nervous system. 

And now, as if the storm was mocking her efforts, an ominous red warning flashed across the screen - "System Overload." The weight of responsibility settled heavy on Amy’s shoulders, each second ticking away like a bomb set to explode.
