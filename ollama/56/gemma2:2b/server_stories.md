The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and deep-fried onions, punctuated by the tangy sting of lemons from the cocktail hour just ending.  Rain hammered against the awning above, blurring the neon "Sunshine Cafe" sign into an abstract watercolor of blues and reds.  Inside, amidst the din of clattering plates and boisterous laughter, Amelia "Amy" Harding bustled between tables, her smile as bright as the fairy lights strung across the ceiling. 

She'd been serving at Sunshine Cafe for five years now – a lifetime in this corner of Portland, a haven filled with regulars, college kids, and the occasional tourist looking to escape the cold reality of their lives.  Amy, however, thrived on chaos. It was in the frenetic energy, in the quick wit exchanges between customers, that she found her rhythm. Tonight, however, felt different. The usual hum was replaced by an oppressive silence punctuated by a low murmur, something in the air seemed to weigh down the room. 

Amy glanced over at Mr. Henderson, their regular - an elderly gentleman who frequented the cafe twice daily and always sat at the same corner table with his worn book of poetry. He hadn't spoken yet and was staring straight ahead, eyes unnaturally wide as if he were seeing something in the shadows beyond her reach.  A shiver ran down her spine. The cafe wasn't just a place anymore – it felt like an enigma, holding a secret only visible to those who truly knew its hidden corners.
