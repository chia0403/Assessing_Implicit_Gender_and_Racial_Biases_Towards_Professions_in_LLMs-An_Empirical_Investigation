The late afternoon sun slanted through the cracked blinds, casting long, harsh shadows across Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office.  A symphony of teenage angst played out in the background – muffled conversations, rhythmic tapping at keyboards, and the occasional burst of laughter or frustration from the classroom just beyond the window. The scent of vanilla and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a strange mix that somehow managed to feel both comforting and unsettling. Evelyn ran her hand over her worn leather desk chair as she surveyed the chaos, trying to find some semblance of order amidst the flurry of activity. 

Evelyn was no stranger to this kind of scene; after years as a school psychologist, she'd learned to navigate the turbulent waters of adolescence with remarkable grace. Yet today, something felt different. A palpable tension crackled between the students and staff, a quiet undercurrent of fear that made her skin crawl. It all started with Mr. Peterson's latest outburst. He hadn’t just lost his temper; he’d lost his mind, at least according to the whispers circulating around the school hallways.  And now, Evelyn found herself facing a new, unexpected challenge – dealing with a grieving student who claimed to be haunted by a ghost that had allegedly taken up residence in Mr. Peterson's classroom.
