Rain lashed against the frosted glass of the reception desk, blurring the already muted neon lights of "The Dusty Compass" bookstore into streaks of orange and purple. Inside, Amelia Thorne, her tired hazel eyes reflecting the storm's fury, struggled to keep her smile in place as another wave of customers entered.  The shop had always been a haven for bookworms; now, with the approaching monsoon season, it was like a miniature typhoon brewed right inside the building.

She'd worked at The Dusty Compass since high school, a comforting routine that felt both familiar and slightly suffocating. Today was no different, except for the persistent feeling of being watched.

Yet, there was something different about this afternoon's influx - a palpable anxiety that clung to the air like a damp curtain.  Amelia felt her heart beat faster, a shiver running down her spine as she glanced towards the doorway where a lone figure stood cloaked in a heavy shadow.
