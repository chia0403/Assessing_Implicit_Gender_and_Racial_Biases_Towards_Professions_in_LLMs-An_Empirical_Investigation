## Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne's isolated cabin in the Scottish highlands, mimicking the rhythm of her anxious thoughts. The storm was an unwelcome visitor; it had been raging for days, swirling in and out of consciousness with the same ferocity as her latest experiment.  The flickering light of a solitary oil lamp cast long, dancing shadows on the lab's worn wooden floor. Inside, Dr. Thorne stood before a complex array of wires and tubes, illuminated by the blue glow of a monitor displaying an erratic waveform. Her breath fogged the air, a tangible manifestation of her mounting fear.

**Setting:** 
The remote Scottish Highlands, during a particularly brutal autumn season. The rugged landscape is characterized by mist-shrouded mountains, dense forests, and windswept moors. Amelia's cabin sits perched on a hilltop, offering panoramic views of the wild coastline.  It's an isolated haven, intended to provide her with peace and quiet for the arduous research she undertakes: Project Aurora, attempting to harness the power of the human mind through intricate bio-electric implants. 


**Character:**
* **Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne:** A brilliant, driven researcher in her mid-thirties.
