## The Bite-Sized Crisis

**Setting:** A bustling city clinic on the corner of Elm Street and Birch Avenue. 

**Character:** Elara Beaumont, known for her infectious smile (and sharp cleaning skills) at the "Beaumont Smiles" dental office.


The morning sun cast long shadows across the waiting room as Elara swept away a stray piece of candy from the floor. It had been another one of those mornings, filled with the constant hum of sterile air and hushed whispers about cavities, fillings, and anxieties about missing teeth. She'd just finished sterilizing a set of instruments when her phone buzzed against her hip, interrupting the symphony of dental equipment. 

"Beaumont Smiles, this is Ms. Henderson," a voice crackled through the receiver. "Elara? I'm calling to see if you could squeeze in Mrs. Peterson for an emergency checkup... she bit into a lemon slice and..." The woman's voice trailed off as if suddenly realizing the gravity of the situation.  

"Mrs. Peterson? Oh no, what happened?" Elara sighed, already picturing Mrs. Peterson’s gnarled hands clutching her chipped dentures. It had been a particularly hectic week: a missing filling in a school-aged boy's mouth, a frantic phone call from a first-time patient with a severe phobia of the dentist (and some rather questionable food choices), and now this… 

A tiny knot formed in Elara’s stomach. The wait was going to be long.
