The wind whipped across the Wyoming prairie, tasting sharp like dust and sagebrush on Elias Thorne's lips as he looked out over his cattle spread. His weathered hands tightened around the worn handle of his Colt revolver, the familiar weight grounding him to reality in the vast emptiness. Elias had known nothing but this rolling landscape since birth – the unforgiving beauty of the mountains, the whispering plains, and the constant rumble of the earth beneath his boots. But lately, a different kind of thunder had been growing within him, a discordant rhythm that echoed the storm brewing on the horizon. His father's voice, a rasping whisper from beyond the grave, kept repeating one word: "Reunion."  

The setting sun painted the sky with fiery hues of orange and crimson, casting long shadows across the ranch where he'd spent his life – Thorne Ranch. He squinted at the distant silhouette of his homestead - a two-story log cabin perched on the edge of a rocky canyon, its weathered timbers creaking in the evening breeze. Elias felt as if he were standing at a crossroads, one leading him back to a family he barely remembered and another that held the promise of a destiny he was unsure he wanted to claim.
