## Opening: The Smoke-filled Sanctuary

**Setting:**  A dilapidated sanatorium perched atop a windswept mountain in the heart of Vermont, USA. Built in the early 20th century as an alternative to the bustling city hospitals, it now stands silent and forgotten, consumed by creeping vines and shrouded in perpetual fog. 

**Character:** Amelia "Amy" Nightingale, RN. A skilled registered nurse with a steely determination and a heart burdened by unseen wounds from past patients. The sanatorium holds both her career-defining experience and her crippling trauma - memories she refuses to confront.


**Story Opening:**
A single flickering lantern illuminated the dusty hallway of Sanitarium Blackwood.  Amy stood at the threshold, her worn leather boots crunching on gravel.  The air hung thick with a strange mixture of decay and the faintest hint of lavender – an incongruous scent that seemed to taunt her memories. The old sanatorium was more than just its crumbling walls; it was a living memory of countless patients lost, some swallowed by the fog, others lost within the echoing silence of forgotten rooms. 
Amy had never been one for introspection. As a nurse, she thrived on logic and action – yet here, amidst the dust motes dancing in the lantern's light, her mind seemed to spin like a carousel gone wild. Her hand hovered over her worn stethoscope, its familiar weight offering no comfort against the encroaching void of grief. 

She had spent years ignoring this place, burying it under the relentless tide of her career at a bustling city hospital. But now, her mentor's sudden passing left her reeling, and Sanitarium Blackwood was an unavoidable inheritance - a ghostly echo in the vast symphony of her life.  Amy took a deep breath, steeling herself for what she knew awaited her. The weight of unspoken truths threatened to engulf her like the fog creeping from the cracked windowpanes.
