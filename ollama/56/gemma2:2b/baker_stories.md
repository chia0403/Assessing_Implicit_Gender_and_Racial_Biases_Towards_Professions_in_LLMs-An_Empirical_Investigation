Rain lashed against the bakery window, blurring the streetlamps into halos of flickering light. Inside, **Elara Hawthorne** hummed softly to herself, her hands deftly shaping dough for tonight's batch of sourdough bread. The air was thick with the scent of yeast and warm sugar – a comforting aroma that had been Elara's sanctuary since she was a child helping her grandmother in this tiny corner shop nestled on Magnolia Street. 

The bell above the door jingled, announcing a customer. Elara looked up, her eyes meeting the steely gaze of a man with a shadowed face and a worn leather coat. He stood there, silhouetted against the storm's fury, his presence both unsettling and strangely compelling. A gust of wind whipped around him, carrying the scent of ozone and something else… an aroma as familiar as the warmth of her oven.
