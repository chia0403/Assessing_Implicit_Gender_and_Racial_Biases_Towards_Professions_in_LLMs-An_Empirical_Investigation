Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Evelyn Albright's quaint nutrition clinic, tucked away on a cobblestone street in Edinburgh's Old Town. The aroma of chamomile tea mingled with the faint scent of cinnamon from her oatmeal cookies, baking in the small oven behind the reception desk. Evelyn, a woman whose warm brown eyes and gentle smile belied her steely resolve when it came to healthy eating, sighed as she glanced at the empty chair opposite her. 

Mr. Alistair McGregor, a notoriously stubborn butcher with a penchant for haggis and whisky, had canceled yet again. A note on her tablet read: "Feeling poorly. Haggis cravings too strong." Evelyn rolled her eyes.  She knew convincing him to swap his beloved pork pies for quinoa salads wouldn't be easy. But she was determined to help Alistair live a longer, healthier life, even if it meant battling a lifetime of culinary traditions.
