The rain hammered against the frosted glass panes of Elsie Beatrice Cartwright's office window, mirroring the relentless thrumming in her head. Papers overflowed from her in-tray, each one a tiny tyrant demanding immediate attention. Outside, London was swallowed by a grey gloom, the kind that seeped into your bones and made even the brightest spirit yearn for a cup of tea and a roaring fire.

Elsie sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear. Her world consisted of endless typing, answering ringing phones with a saccharine smile she didn't always feel, and navigating the labyrinthine bureaucracy of her boss, Mr. Archibald Thistlewick - a man who believed efficiency was achieved through sheer volume of memos. 

Today, however, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, an unspoken promise carried on the wind that snaked its way through the office's drafty corridors. Elsie couldn't explain it, but a prickle of excitement danced along her spine, telling her this was no ordinary Tuesday.
