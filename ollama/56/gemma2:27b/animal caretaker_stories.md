Rain lashed against the windows of the ramshackle barn, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of spray. The air hung heavy with the mingled scents of hay, wet dog, and something faintly metallic - rust, perhaps, or old blood. Amelia Thistlewick sighed, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself. She'd been up since dawn, tending to the rescued animals that called Whispering Pines Sanctuary home.

A cacophony of barks, meows, and squawks rose from the stalls and cages, a symphony only Amelia truly understood. There was Patches, the one-eyed terrier who'd been abandoned in a cardboard box; Snowdrop, the elegant Persian with a perpetually grumpy expression; and Zephyr, the injured hawk whose wing she was painstakingly nursing back to health. They were her responsibility, each creature entrusted to her care, and Amelia wouldn't have it any other way. 


But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she surveyed the storm-battered sanctuary. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old wooden beams.

And then, a sound cut through the night, sharp and chilling – a shriek. Not one of the animals Amelia knew. This was something else entirely. Something…wild.
