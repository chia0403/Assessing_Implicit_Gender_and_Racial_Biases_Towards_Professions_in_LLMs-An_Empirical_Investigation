The elevator hummed its slow ascent, each floor ticking by like a metronome counting down to Eleanor Vance's impending doom.  Eleanor wasn't prone to hyperbole, but tonight felt different. Tonight, she was presenting the results of Project Nightingale to the board – a project that had consumed her for the past two years, a project on which her entire career hinged. 

The plush carpet of the elevator seemed to mock her with its pristine stillness, while Eleanor's stomach churned like a washing machine on high spin.  Her reflection in the mirrored wall showed a woman whose sharp blazer and impeccably styled bob couldn’t disguise the worry etched on her face. The imposing glass-and-steel skyscraper housing Vance Enterprises reflected the city lights below, a glittering testament to ambition and ruthless efficiency – values Eleanor had embodied for years. But tonight, she questioned everything.

As the elevator finally reached the top floor, its doors slid open revealing a mahogany-panelled room bathed in the warm glow of chandeliers. The board members sat around a long, polished table, their faces impassive masks waiting to be judged.  Eleanor took a deep breath and stepped into the lions' den.
