Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already muted colors of autumn into an impressionistic smear. The scent of disinfectant mingled with wet wool and the faint sweetness of overripe apples from the staff lounge, creating a uniquely sterile yet strangely comforting atmosphere.

Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Finch adjusted her spectacles, peering intently at the progress chart for Mrs. Henderson, a stroke survivor struggling to regain control of her left hand. A frown creased Ellie's forehead as she noted the slow, inconsistent improvement. Mrs. Henderson was fiercely determined, but the road to recovery was proving arduous and frustrating.

Ellie sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its bun. She knew this wasn't just about physical therapy anymore. It was about rekindling hope, restoring dignity, and reminding Mrs. Henderson of the vibrant life she yearned to reclaim.  As Ellie prepared herself for another session, the insistent ringing of the phone pierced the quiet hum of the ward.

"St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, Eleanor Finch speaking," she answered, bracing herself for whatever new challenge awaited her.
