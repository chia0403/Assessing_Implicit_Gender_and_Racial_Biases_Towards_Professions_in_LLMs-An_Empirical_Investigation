Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic watercolor.  The antique grandfather clock in the corner ticked with monotonous regularity, each chime a hammer blow against the tense silence that had settled over the room. Across from Eleanor sat her patient, a young woman named Amelia Wright, whose trembling hands clutched a worn handkerchief. The faint scent of lavender clung to the fabric, a fragile attempt at serenity amidst the storm raging both outside and within Amelia's haunted eyes.  Eleanor leaned forward, her own gaze steady and empathetic. "Tell me," she said softly, "what brought you here today?"
