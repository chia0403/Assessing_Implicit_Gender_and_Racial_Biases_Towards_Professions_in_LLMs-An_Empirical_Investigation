The scent of jasmine and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, clashing violently with the acrid tang of stale cigarette smoke emanating from the crumpled armchair. Eloise Beaumont, her scarlet dress a defiant splash against the room's faded grandeur, surveyed the scene with a critical eye. Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sunlight slanting through grimy windows, illuminating chipped gilt on ornate picture frames and threadbare Persian rugs stained with the ghosts of forgotten spills.  

This was the drawing-room of Blackwood Manor, a once magnificent Victorian estate now teetering on the precipice of ruin. Eloise had been called upon by Alistair Blackwood, the reclusive owner, who seemed as faded and melancholic as his ancestral home. He'd whispered about restoring the manor to its former glory, a yearning for a past that felt as distant as the stars.  Eloise, with her innate understanding of space, light, and forgotten beauty, was determined to help him find it.
