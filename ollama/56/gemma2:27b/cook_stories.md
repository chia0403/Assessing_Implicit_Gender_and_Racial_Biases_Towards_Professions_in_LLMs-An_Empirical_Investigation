The air hung thick with the scent of simmering garlic and cumin. Outside, the Parisian drizzle drummed a steady rhythm against the warped wooden shutters of Le Petit Coin, Amelia Dubois' cozy bistro tucked away on a cobblestone street in Montmartre. Inside, Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, deftly sliced a crimson tomato, its juice staining her fingertips like tiny drops of blood. The rhythmic chop was punctuated by the hiss of oil in the pan and the clinking of copper pots hanging above her head. Tonight, she was preparing her signature coq au vin for a particularly demanding food critic. A bead of sweat trickled down Amelia's temple, but she didn't flinch. Years of working in kitchens across Europe had forged her into a culinary warrior, undaunted by the pressures of perfection.
