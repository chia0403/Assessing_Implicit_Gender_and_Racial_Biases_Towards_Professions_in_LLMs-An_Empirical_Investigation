The musty scent of ancient parchment mingled with the sharp tang of freshly brewed coffee in Professor Elara Vance's cramped office. Rain lashed against the arched windows of the ivy-clad Oxford college, casting dancing shadows across her cluttered desk. Stacks of dog-eared manuscripts threatened to spill onto the worn Persian rug beneath her feet. A half-eaten scone sat precariously beside a steaming mug, its crumbs echoing the chaos that seemed to reign in Elara's world.  

She was hunched over a faded scroll, her brow furrowed in concentration as she deciphered archaic runes. The parchment crackled with age beneath her fingertips, whispering secrets of a forgotten civilization. Today, however, those secrets felt tantalizingly out of reach. A persistent sense of unease gnawed at Elara, like a ravenous beast clawing its way from within. It had started subtly: fleeting shadows in the periphery, whispers carried on the wind, and an unshakable feeling that she was being watched.
