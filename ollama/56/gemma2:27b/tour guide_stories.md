The sulfurous scent hung heavy in the air, mixing with the sweet tang of overripe mangoes from a nearby stall.  Elias "Eli" Toussaint adjusted his straw fedora, shielding his eyes from the relentless afternoon sun beating down on Pompeii's ancient streets. Dust swirled around his leather sandals as he gestured towards a crumbling fresco depicting a lively marketplace scene. 

"Imagine," Eli announced to his small group of tourists, his voice laced with practiced enthusiasm, "this very spot teeming with merchants hawking their wares, children chasing stray dogs, and the aroma of freshly baked bread filling the air." He paused, allowing them to absorb the image before continuing. "But that was almost two thousand years ago, before Vesuvius had its say…"

Eli’s words trailed off as a shiver ran down his spine.  The shadow of the volcano loomed over Pompeii even today, a constant reminder of the cataclysmic eruption that had forever entombed this Roman city. It was a presence Eli felt acutely, a tangible connection to the past he sought to unravel for his visitors every day.
