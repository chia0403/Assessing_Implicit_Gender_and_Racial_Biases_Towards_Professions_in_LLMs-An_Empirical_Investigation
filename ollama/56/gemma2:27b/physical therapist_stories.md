Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the clinic, blurring the already fading neon sign that read "Hope Springs Physical Therapy." Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth sighed, her breath fogging the glass partition separating her tiny office from the sparsely equipped gym. The rhythmic thump of a basketball bouncing echoed off the linoleum floor – her only patient today, a young man named Liam struggling to regain mobility in his knee after a nasty basketball injury. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock, its hands ticking slowly towards closing time. Another slow day in Hope Springs. A town where dreams seemed to wither and die alongside the rusted husks of abandoned factories dotting the landscape.  Yet, Eleanor clung onto her own hope – the belief that she could make a difference, one aching joint, one strained muscle at a time.
