The humid Florida air clung to Theodore "Teddy" Buchanan like a wet towel as he wrestled with a stubborn pipe beneath Mrs. Henderson's sink. The ancient plumbing groaned in protest, spewing a geyser of rust-colored water onto Teddy's already soaked overalls. Sweat stung his eyes, and the scent of mildew hung heavy in the cramped space under the sink. "Just a little further," he muttered, straining to loosen the corroded coupling. Outside, cicadas throbbed their relentless summer symphony, punctuated by the occasional honk from a car stuck in traffic on the sweltering asphalt.

Teddy's life was a constant dance with leaking faucets, clogged drains, and sputtering water heaters. He wasn't complaining - plumbing paid the bills, and he took pride in his ability to tame even the most unruly pipes. But today, the relentless humidity and Mrs. Henderson's incessant chatter about her prize-winning orchids were testing his patience.
