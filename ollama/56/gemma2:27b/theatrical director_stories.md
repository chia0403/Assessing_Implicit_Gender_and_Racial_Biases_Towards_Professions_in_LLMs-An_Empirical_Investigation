The air backstage crackled with nervous energy, thick as the fog machine's output that hung heavy over the stage. Amelia Rosalind Thorne, her silver braid swinging rhythmically as she paced, felt it in her bones. "Places!" she barked, her voice cutting through the murmuring chorus of actors adjusting costumes and lines. 

The Grand Majestic Theatre, a behemoth of faded velvet and gilded balconies, was Amelia's domain tonight. For months, she'd poured her soul into this production - a daring adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth set in a dystopian future ruled by AI overlords.  Tonight, it all culminated. The curtain would rise, revealing not a Scottish moor but a sterile cityscape bathed in the cold blue glow of holographic advertisements. Amelia hoped the audience would see past the futuristic veneer and grasp the timeless struggle for power that throbbed at the play's core.
