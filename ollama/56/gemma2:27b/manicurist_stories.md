The neon sign outside flickered, its pink "Nails by Nadine" casting a sickly glow on the rain-slicked asphalt. Inside, Nadine Dubois hummed along to a forgotten 80s pop song, her acrylic nails clicking against the chipped Formica countertop as she meticulously filed down Mrs. Patel's overgrown cuticles. Outside, thunder grumbled, threatening another deluge.

Nadine’s salon, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Brooklyn, was a haven from the city's chaos.  The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender polish, punctuated by the occasional burst of laughter or gossip. For Nadine, it wasn't just about manicures; it was about connection, creating tiny works of art on each fingertip while listening to her clients’ joys, sorrows, and everything in between.  Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach. Something felt off. 

Mrs. Patel, usually the picture of cheerful chatter, was uncharacteristically quiet. Her gaze darted nervously towards the back door, a tremor running through her wrinkled hand as Nadine gently buffed her nails.
