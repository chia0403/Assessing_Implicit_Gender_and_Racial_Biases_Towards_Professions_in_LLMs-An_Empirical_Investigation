The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's weathered shoulders as he chipped away at a block of rough-hewn granite. Dust plumed around him, catching the light like miniature sparks. The rhythmic clang of his chisel against stone echoed through the cavernous workshop, punctuated by the occasional grunt as Silas strained to guide the blow.

His workshop wasn't much to look at - just a ramshackle wooden building nestled against the sheer face of a mountain in the remote village of Stonemont. But within its walls resided centuries of knowledge passed down from father to son, etched into the very timbers and stones themselves. Silas, with his calloused hands and eyes as grey as the granite he sculpted, was the latest custodian of this legacy. 


Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in Silas's stomach. He wasn't carving just any monument; this was a commission from Lord Alaric, the village lord known for his cold heart and even colder gaze. The stone was to be shaped into a mausoleum for Alaric's recently deceased wife - a woman Silas had only glimpsed once, her face obscured by a veil, but whose mournful absence seemed to hang heavy in the air of Stonemont.
