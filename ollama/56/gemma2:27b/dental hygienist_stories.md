Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Smile Bright Dental, blurring the cheerful sunshine mural painted on the glass. Eleanor Penelope Finch sighed, watching the droplets race each other down the pane. It was a Tuesday, which usually meant a steady stream of patients, but today, only one lonely soul braved the storm: Mrs. Higgins, notorious for her sugar cravings and aversion to flossing.

Eleanor adjusted her navy blue scrubs, the embroidered "Ellie" catching the dim light filtering through the window. She loved her job â€“ the meticulous work, the sense of accomplishment in helping people maintain healthy smiles. But Tuesdays during a downpour always felt like a slow, soggy slog.  


She glanced at the clock; only ten minutes until Mrs. Higgins' appointment.  Maybe she'd finally convince the woman to try an electric toothbrush? Or, more realistically, maybe Eleanor would just survive another round of sugary confessionals and awkward silence.
