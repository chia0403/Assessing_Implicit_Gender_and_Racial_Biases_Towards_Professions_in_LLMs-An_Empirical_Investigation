The Nevada desert stretched out before Jasper "Jazz" Callahan like an endless ochre sea, shimmering under the relentless July sun.  He squinted through the dusty haze, his weathered face etched with years spent battling the road. The cab of his 18-wheeler, a trusty Peterbilt named Bessie after his late grandmother, rumbled along Highway 95, its engine a steady heartbeat against the silence. 

Jazz was hauling a load of citrus fruit from Yuma to Reno, a familiar route that he'd driven countless times before. But today, something felt different. An uneasy itch crawled under his skin, a prickling sensation he couldn't quite place. Maybe it was the unsettling stillness of the desert air, devoid of its usual windswept howl. Or maybe it was the strange glint he’d seen earlier, a fleeting flash of silver in the distance that could have been anything – sunlight reflecting off a rock, or something more… unnatural.
