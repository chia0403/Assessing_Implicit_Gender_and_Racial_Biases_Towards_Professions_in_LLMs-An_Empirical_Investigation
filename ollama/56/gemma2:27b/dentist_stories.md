The salty air whipped Amelia Blackwood's hair across her face as she wrestled with the rickety umbrella. It was hardly protection against the sudden squall that had descended upon the sleepy coastal town of Seahaven. A rogue gust snatched the umbrella entirely, sending it pirouetting down the cobblestone street before disappearing into a puddle with a pathetic plop. Amelia sighed, resigning herself to being thoroughly drenched.

She glanced at the sign above her: "Blackwood Dentistry - Where Smiles Bloom." The irony wasn't lost on her. Today, the only bloom she felt was a growing anxiety about her first day running the practice her grandfather had built from the ground up. 


Seahaven, with its charming harbor and pastel-colored houses, seemed idyllic enough, but Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something lurked beneath the surface, something as unpredictable as the weather.

As she pushed open the door to the clinic, a wave of antiseptic scent washed over her, momentarily calming the storm raging inside her. It was time to face the unknown, to see if Seahaven's smiles were truly ready to bloom.
