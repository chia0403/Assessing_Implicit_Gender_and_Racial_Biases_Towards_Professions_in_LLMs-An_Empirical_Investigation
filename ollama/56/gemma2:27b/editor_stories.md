The flickering neon sign outside cast an oily green glow across Amelia Winthrop's desk, illuminating stacks of paper teetering precariously on every available surface. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart. Amelia chewed nervously on the end of her pen, her gaze darting between the manuscript sprawled open before her and the ticking clock on the wall. Midnight loomed.

Amelia's cramped office, tucked away in a shadowy alcove of the old publishing house, reeked of stale coffee and forgotten dreams. Dust motes danced in the sickly green light, swirling around towering shelves crammed with dusty volumes, each one whispering stories untold. The air was thick with tension, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of her ancient typewriter.

Tonight was deadline night. And Amelia, senior editor at Blackwood & Sons, had a monster on her hands.
