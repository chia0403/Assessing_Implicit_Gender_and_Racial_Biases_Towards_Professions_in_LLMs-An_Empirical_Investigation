Rain lashed against the cracked windowpanes of Elsie "Sparkplug" Henderson's workshop, blurring the neon glow of the "Elsie's Electric: We Fix What Others Fry!" sign hanging precariously outside. The air was thick with the smell of ozone and burnt copper, a comforting aroma for Elsie.

Elsie, her grease-stained overalls barely containing her muscular frame, hunched over a tangle of wires spewing sparks like an angry dragon. Her calloused fingers, nimble despite their size, danced across the exposed circuitry. A symphony of clicks, whirs, and pops filled the cramped space as she coaxed life back into a vintage jukebox, its chrome dulled by decades of neglect.

She hadn't intended to be an electrician. Elsie dreamed of being a musician, her fingers yearning for the fretboard of a guitar instead of the cold metal of wiring. But life had other plans, forcing her to take over the family business after her father, a renowned electrician himself, passed away unexpectedly. 


Now, surrounded by humming transformers and flickering fluorescent lights, Elsie found solace in the logic of electricity, channeling her creativity into restoring forgotten machines to their former glory. Tonight's job was particularly challenging – the jukebox belonged to Mr. Finchley, a reclusive antique collector who rumored to possess a fortune hidden somewhere within his crumbling mansion on the hill.

Elsie paused, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow. The storm raged outside, mirroring the storm brewing within her. A cryptic message left by Mr. Finchley hinted at something more than just a simple repair. It spoke of a secret, locked within the jukebox's melodies – a secret Elsie felt compelled to unravel.
