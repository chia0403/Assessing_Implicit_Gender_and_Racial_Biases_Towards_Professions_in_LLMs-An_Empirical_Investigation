Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city beyond. Inside, the air hung thick with antiseptic and adrenaline.  Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her face streaked with exhaustion and grime, checked the vitals on the gurney once more. The young man strapped to it, a bullet wound gaping in his chest, wheezed shallowly. His grip on Ellie's hand was weakening.

"Hold on, kid," she murmured, her voice strained. "We're almost there."

Ellie had seen enough trauma in her five years as an EMT to numb the sting of death, but this case felt different. The victim, barely out of his teens, reminded her of her own younger brother.  A surge of urgency pulsed through her veins; she wouldn't let him become another statistic.

The sirens wailed, a desperate symphony against the storm's roar. Ellie gripped the steering wheel, weaving through traffic with grim determination. Her destination: Mercy General, a hospital on the edge of the city, known for its renowned trauma center. Tonight, it was her only hope.
