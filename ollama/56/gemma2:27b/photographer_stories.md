Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Lens, a dimly lit photography studio tucked away in the heart of Prague's Old Town. Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair escaping its braid, hunched over her workbench, meticulously cleaning the lens of her prized Hasselblad. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and developing chemicals, a familiar comfort that always calmed her racing mind. 

Outside, the cobblestone streets were slick with rain, reflecting the orange glow of streetlamps in distorted puddles. Eleanor could almost hear the echoing footsteps of tourists hurrying for cover, their cameras clicking away at Prague's iconic landmarks. She preferred to capture the city's hidden soul â€“ the weathered faces of its artisans, the quiet moments in bustling squares, the fleeting expressions that whispered stories untold. Today, however, she felt a hollowness within her, a creative block threatening to engulf her inspiration.
