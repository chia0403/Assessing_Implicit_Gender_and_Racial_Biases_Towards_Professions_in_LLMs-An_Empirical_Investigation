The wind whistled through the rusted iron bars of the watchtower, carrying with it the scent of brine and something else, something faintly metallic that pricked at Elara Thorne's nose. It wasn't unusual for the coastal city of Saltwind to reek of decay - ships brought in not just goods but also diseases, secrets, and sometimes, bodies. But this smell...it was sharper, closer.

Elara tightened her grip on her spear, its worn haft cold against her calloused fingers.  Below, the docks bustled with activity despite the fading light. Merchants hawked their wares, sailors cursed and laughed, children chased seagulls through the maze of crates and barrels. But Elara couldn't tear her gaze from the shadowed alleyway across the harbor. Something stirred there, something hidden in the gloom that made her gut twist.

The watchtower creaked under the strain of the wind, a lonely sentinel overlooking the teeming city. For five years, Elara had stood guard here, watching over Saltwind's restless heart. She knew its rhythms like the back of her hand - the ebb and flow of the tides, the call of the gulls, the drunken brawl that inevitably erupted in The Salty Dog tavern every Friday night.

But tonight, something felt different. Something felt...wrong.
