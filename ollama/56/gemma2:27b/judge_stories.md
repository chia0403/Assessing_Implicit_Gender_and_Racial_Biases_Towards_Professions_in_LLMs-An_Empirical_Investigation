The late afternoon sun, already sinking towards the horizon, cast long shadows across Judge Elias Augustine's mahogany desk. Dust motes danced in the golden rays, illuminating the stacks of legal briefs piled precariously beside his weathered leather-bound law books.  Elias sighed, running a hand through his silvering hair. The courtroom was silent, the last case for the day having concluded with a guilty verdict that left him feeling hollow rather than satisfied.

He gazed out the window, overlooking the bustling cityscape of New Alexandria. Below him, trams clattered along the cobbled streets, their passengers a tapestry of weary workers and eager shoppers returning home. A sense of detachment washed over Elias; the familiar cityscape seemed alien today, its vibrant energy muted by a weariness that had settled deep within his bones.

For thirty years, Judge Augustine had served on the bench, dispensing justice with unwavering fairness. But lately, the weight of countless decisions, each one impacting lives irrevocably, pressed down on him with an almost unbearable burden. He wondered if he was still making a difference, or merely going through the motions, his rulings echoing in the sterile halls of justice without truly touching the hearts of those involved.
