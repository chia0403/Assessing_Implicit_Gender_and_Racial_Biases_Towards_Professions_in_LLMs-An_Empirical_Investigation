The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and antiseptic, a familiar comfort to Elias Alistair Finch. He stood behind the counter of Finch & Sons Apothecary, his grandfather's legacy tucked away on a quiet side street in Charleston. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating swirling motes of dust and casting long shadows from the apothecary jars lining the shelves. The ticking of an antique clock echoed in the cavernous space, punctuated by the occasional rustle of parchment as Elias consulted his ancient recipe books.

Today was slow, the usual trickle of regulars seeking their monthly prescriptions or a soothing balm for aching joints barely disturbing the stillness. Elias preferred it this way. He relished the quiet moments, the chance to lose himself in the intricacies of herbal lore and the satisfaction of crafting personalized remedies from scratch.  But today, something felt different. A restlessness stirred beneath his calm demeanor, a premonition he couldn't quite place. 

The bell above the door chimed, breaking the silence. Elias looked up, expecting to see Mrs. O'Malley with her request for chamomile tea. Instead, a young woman stood framed in the doorway, her face obscured by the shadows cast by her wide-brimmed hat.
