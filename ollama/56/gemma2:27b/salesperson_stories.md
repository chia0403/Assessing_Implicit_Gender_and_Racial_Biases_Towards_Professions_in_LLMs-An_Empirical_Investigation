Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Finch's cramped office cubicle, mimicking the drumming anxiety in his chest.  The flickering fluorescent light above cast harsh shadows across his desk cluttered with brochures, order forms, and a half-eaten tuna sandwich. Elias, a man whose sharp cheekbones and piercing blue eyes betrayed a weariness beyond his 32 years, stared out at the dreary cityscape of Newhaven. He was in the middle of his worst slump ever.

For three months straight, Elias had been struggling to close deals at "Innovative Solutions," a company peddling dubious software upgrades to small businesses. The relentless pressure from his manager, Mr. Henderson, a man whose smile never reached his cold eyes, weighed heavily on him. Today was the deadline for reaching his quarterly quota, and Elias was still woefully short. He needed a miracle.  

Suddenly, the phone on his desk buzzed, startling him out of his reverie. His heart leaped â€“ perhaps this was it, the call that would turn everything around.
