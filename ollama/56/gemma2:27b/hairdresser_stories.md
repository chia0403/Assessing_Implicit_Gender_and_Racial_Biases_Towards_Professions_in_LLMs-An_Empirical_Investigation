The scent of lavender shampoo and singed hair hung heavy in the air of "Curl Up & Dye," Ophelia Bellweather's tiny salon tucked away on a cobblestone street in Edinburgh's Old Town. Rain lashed against the leaded glass windowpane, blurring the ancient stone buildings beyond into an impressionist painting. Ophelia herself, perched on a wobbly stool with a pair of silver scissors glinting in her hand, was battling a particularly stubborn knot in Mrs. McGregor's hair. 

"Och, Ophelia," Mrs. McGregor winced, "you're tugging like a terrier on a bone!" 

Ophelia sighed, smoothing down the frazzled grey curls with practiced gentleness. "Sorry, Mrs. Mac. It's this weather. Makes everyone's hair do daft things."  


Her eyes flickered to the clock above the mirror â€“ nearly closing time. And yet, something felt off today. A prickling sensation on the back of her neck, a sense that someone was watching her from beyond the rain-streaked window.
