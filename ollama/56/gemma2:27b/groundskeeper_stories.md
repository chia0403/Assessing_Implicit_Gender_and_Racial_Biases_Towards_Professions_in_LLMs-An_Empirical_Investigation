The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of honeysuckle, clinging to Percival "Percy" Hawthorne like a second skin as he pushed his ancient mower across the emerald expanse. The sprawling lawns of Blackwood Manor were Percy's domain, a kingdom of manicured hedges, vibrant flowerbeds, and towering oaks that whispered secrets in the breeze.

He paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with a gnarled hand. The sun, already high in the sapphire sky, cast long shadows across the grounds. Today was unlike any other. A sense of unease, a prickling at the back of his neck, had been following him since dawn. Blackwood Manor, usually tranquil and serene, hummed with an unsettling energy.
