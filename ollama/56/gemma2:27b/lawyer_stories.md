Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia Cartwright's office, blurring the already indistinct skyline of downtown Chicago. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Papers littered her mahogany desk like fallen autumn leaves, each one representing another soul caught in the unforgiving maw of the legal system. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Tonight was her tenth wedding anniversary, and she was buried under a mountain of case files. 

Her phone buzzed insistently, a reminder that her husband, David, had reserved a table at their favorite Italian restaurant. Guilt gnawed at her. He'd patiently endured countless late nights and cancelled dates, understanding the weight Amelia carried on her shoulders. But tonight felt different. Tonight, she yearned to be anywhere but here, surrounded by the ghosts of broken promises and shattered dreams.
