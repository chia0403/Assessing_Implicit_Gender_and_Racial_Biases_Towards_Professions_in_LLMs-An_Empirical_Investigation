The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and anticipation. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Victorian London pulsed with the midday bustle – hansom cabs clattering over uneven stones, newsboys hawking their wares, and ladies in voluminous skirts navigating the throngs with practiced grace. Inside Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' barbershop, however, time seemed to slow. The only sound was the rhythmic rasp of Bart's razor against a customer's stubble, punctuated by the occasional clink of scissors. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windowpane, illuminated motes dancing in the air and cast long shadows from the antique barber chairs lining the walls.

Bart, his face etched with lines earned from years of laughter and worry, worked with focused precision. His hands, calloused yet surprisingly gentle, sculpted sideburns and trimmed mustaches with an artist's touch. He knew each customer's preference by heart – Mr. Fitzwilliam's precisely-shaped mutton chops, young Master Davies' rebellious pompadour, and the Widow Hawthorne's simple, elegant bob.

But today, a stranger occupied Bart's chair. A tall man shrouded in a heavy woolen coat, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. He sat ramrod straight, an unsettling stillness radiating from him. When Bart inquired about his desired style, the stranger simply said, "Something... inconspicuous."

Bart felt a shiver crawl up his spine. Something about this man's shadowed eyes and the way he clutched his worn leather satchel spoke of secrets best left undisturbed. Yet, as a barber who prided himself on discretion and service, Bart knew he couldn't turn away a customer.
