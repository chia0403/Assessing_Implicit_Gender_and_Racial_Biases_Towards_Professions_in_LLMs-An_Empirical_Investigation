The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across Dr. Eleanor Vance's cluttered desk. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of her tiny office in the basement of the New Orleans Police Department. A mug emblazoned with "World's Best Forensic Psychologist" sat forgotten beside a stack of case files, its contents cold and untouched. Eleanor ran a weary hand through her auburn curls, already feeling the familiar ache behind her eyes.

The file in front of her was particularly gruesome: the double homicide of a young couple found bound and shot execution-style in their French Quarter apartment. The only clue? A single playing card, the Queen of Spades, nestled between the victims' lifeless hands. Eleanor sighed. It was cases like this that reminded her why she'd chosen this path, the relentless pursuit of understanding the darkest corners of the human psyche.  But tonight, even the thrill of the chase felt muted by a weariness that seeped into her bones.
