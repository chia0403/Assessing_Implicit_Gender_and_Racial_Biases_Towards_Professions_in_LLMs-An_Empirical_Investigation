The wind whipped across Silas Blackwood's weathered face, carrying with it the sharp scent of rain and freshly turned earth. Dawn was breaking over the rolling hills of Willow Creek Valley, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange. Silas squinted at the horizon, his calloused hands gripping the worn handle of his pitchfork. The crops needed tending, even on a day like this, when the air hung heavy with the promise of a storm.

For generations, his family had tilled these very fields, coaxing life from the stubborn soil and weathering every hardship the seasons threw their way. But lately, a disquiet had settled over him, a feeling that something was amiss in the rhythm of nature. The rains seemed heavier, the sun hotter, and the whispers on the wind carried an unfamiliar chill.
