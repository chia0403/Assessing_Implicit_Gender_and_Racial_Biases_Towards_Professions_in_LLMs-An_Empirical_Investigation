The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine as Eloise Beaumont hurried down Rue de la Paix, her heels clicking impatiently against the cobblestone street.  Paris shimmered under a midday sun, its golden light glinting off the Seine and turning the ornate iron balconies into shimmering lace. But Eloise barely noticed the beauty surrounding her. Her mind was consumed with the story: a whisper of a scandal involving a prominent politician and a clandestine meeting in the heart of the Louvre.

Eloise, a tenacious investigative reporter for Le Monde, prided herself on sniffing out stories that others overlooked. This one, however, felt different. It smelled of danger, of secrets buried so deep they threatened to crumble the foundations of Parisian society. She clutched the crumpled note in her hand â€“ a single sentence scrawled in hurried handwriting: "Midnight. Venus de Milo room."  A shiver ran down Eloise's spine. Tonight, she was diving into the shadows.
