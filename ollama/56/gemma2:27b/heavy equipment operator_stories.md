The Nevada sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Thorne's neck like a branding iron. Sweat slicked his skin, plastering his worn Caterpillar cap to his forehead. He gripped the controls of the colossal excavator, its steel jaws groaning as they tore into the stubborn earth. Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of Eli's machine and the distant whine of other equipment working on the sprawling mine site. The air smelled acrid - a mix of diesel fumes, pulverized rock, and the faint tang of copper ore. 

Eli had been operating heavy machinery for over twenty years. He knew this behemoth like an extension of his own body, could anticipate its every shudder and groan. Today, he was tasked with clearing a new section for exploratory drilling â€“ a crucial step in the ongoing search for untapped veins of precious metal deep beneath the Nevada desert.
