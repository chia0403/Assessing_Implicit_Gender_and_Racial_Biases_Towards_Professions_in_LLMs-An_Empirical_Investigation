The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Ophelia Davenport's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the pristine white countertop where she sat. The air conditioning wheezed like an asthmatic dragon, struggling to cool the sweltering July heat that seeped through the glass doors of the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby. Eloise, perched on her ergonomic swivel chair, watched with practiced indifference as tourists shuffled in and out, their faces a tapestry of sunburn, confusion, and weary excitement. 

Outside, the roar of traffic and the distant clang of a trolley bell punctuated the hushed murmur of conversations within the opulent lobby. Tourists lugged oversized suitcases, honeymooners giggled nervously, and businessmen barked into their phones â€“ all converging on Eloise's polished mahogany desk like moths to a flickering flame. It was her job, she reminded herself with a weary sigh, to be the calm in the storm.
