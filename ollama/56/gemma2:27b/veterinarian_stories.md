Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. Inside, Dr. Eliza Bennett sighed, the scent of disinfectant and wet dog fur thick in the air. The old clock on the wall ticked with monotonous regularity, mirroring the relentless drumming outside. It was almost midnight, and Eliza had been at the clinic for fourteen straight hours, battling a particularly nasty outbreak of canine parvovirus. 

She sat slumped in her chair, exhaustion tugging at her eyelids.

The joy of saving an animal's life, the bond she formed with furry companions and their worried owners â€“ these were the rewards that made the long hours and emotional turmoil worth it. 

But tonight felt different. A gnawing unease settled in her stomach. It wasn't just the relentless pace of the outbreak; there was something else, a subtle shift in the air, like the premonition of a storm brewing beyond the immediate horizon.  She glanced at the phone, its red light blinking ominously with another incoming call. 


Eliza took a deep breath and answered. "Dr. Bennett speaking." The voice on the other end sent a shiver down her spine. It was low, gravelly, and tinged with an unmistakable urgency.
