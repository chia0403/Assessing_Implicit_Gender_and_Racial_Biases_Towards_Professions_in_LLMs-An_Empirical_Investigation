The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting Amelia "Amy" O'Connell and her patrons in alternating streaks of pink and turquoise. The air inside The Rusty Mug hung thick with the scent of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and fried onions – a comforting aroma to Amy, who'd been inhaling it for almost a decade. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the lights of the city beyond into an impressionistic smear. A lone saxophone wailed mournfully from a hidden corner booth, its melody weaving between the clatter of glasses and the low hum of conversation.

Amy wiped down the bar with practiced efficiency, her dark curls escaping their usual bun and framing tired eyes. Despite the gloom outside, The Rusty Mug throbbed with life: a gaggle of college students celebrating a hard-won exam, a weary businessman drowning his sorrows in scotch, a pair of retirees arguing about the price of tomatoes. It was Amy's job to keep them all afloat – literally and figuratively – serving drinks, dispensing advice, and occasionally breaking up bar fights. Tonight, however, something felt different. A tension hummed beneath the surface, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that told her tonight wouldn't be ordinary.
