Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic wash of grey and yellow. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous symphony, barely cutting through the oppressive gloom that seemed to cling to every corner. Amelia Rose Carmichael, RN, adjusted her scrubs and sighed.  

Another double shift.  She glanced at the clock - 3:17 AM. The ER was eerily quiet, punctuated only by the occasional beep of a monitor and the rustle of paper gowns. A lull before the storm, she thought grimly, knowing that as soon as sunrise painted the sky, the doors would burst open with a fresh wave of injured and ill.  

But tonight, Amelia wasn't just waiting for the storm; she was bracing herself for it. The news had been buzzing all day about the outbreak - a strange, aggressive flu-like virus spreading through the city like wildfire. Her gut twisted. 

St. Jude's, already stretched thin, was on the front lines.  Amelia knew what awaited her: long hours, overflowing wards, and faces etched with fear. Yet, despite the exhaustion gnawing at her bones, a flicker of steely determination ignited in her emerald eyes.  This was her calling, her purpose. Amelia Rose Carmichael wasn't going to let anything stand in the way of caring for those who needed her most.
