The stale air of the gymnasium hung heavy with the ghosts of past victories and defeats. Dust motes danced in the anemic rays of sunlight slanting through the grimy windows. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her salt-and-pepper hair pulled back in a tight bun, paced along the sideline, her sneakers squeaking on the polished wood floor. The scoreboard, dusty and silent, glared down at her with its blank, accusing face. Three weeks. It had been three weeks since she'd last heard the satisfying thump of a basketball against the court, the excited shouts of players, the squeak of sneakers in a frantic dance.

Three weeks since her star player, Marcus "Magic" Johnson, had walked out on her and the team, leaving behind a gaping hole not just in their roster, but in Ellie's heart.
