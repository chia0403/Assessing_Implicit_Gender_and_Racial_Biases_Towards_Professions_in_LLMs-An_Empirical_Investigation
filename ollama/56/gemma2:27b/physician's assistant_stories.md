The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the clinic, each drop sounding like a tiny hammer blow. Amelia "Amy" Dubois grimaced, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself. The power had flickered out hours ago, plunging the small village clinic into near-darkness. Only a sputtering kerosene lamp cast feeble shadows across the worn examination tables and overflowing medical supply shelves.

Outside, the wind howled through the mango trees lining the dusty road, whipping up a frenzy of leaves and debris. Amy knew that meant patients would be scarce tonight. Few brave souls ventured out in this kind of weather, especially not with the threat of landslides looming over the nearby hills. But she remained vigilant, her stethoscope hanging ready around her neck, just in case someone stumbled through the rain-lashed doorway needing her help. 

Tonight, however, she wasn't sure what frightened her more: the storm raging outside or the gnawing unease that twisted in her gut. It had been building for days, a sense of foreboding so strong it felt like a physical presence. Something was wrong, deeply wrong, but she couldn't put her finger on it.
