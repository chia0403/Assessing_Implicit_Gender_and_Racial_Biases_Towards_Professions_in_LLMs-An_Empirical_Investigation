The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Butcher's shop hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary, a peculiar blend that Bart considered comforting. Dawn had barely cracked the sky over Market Street, painting the cobblestone streets in hues of lavender and slate grey, when he began his daily ritual. The rhythmic thud of cleaver on bone echoed through the small space, punctuated by the gentle scrape of his steel against the sharpening stone. 

Bart's shop, "The Butcher's Block", wasn't fancy. Its chipped wooden sign hung precariously above the door, and the display case was perpetually smudged with fingerprints, but its contents were always fresh, always expertly prepared. Bart took pride in his craft, treating each animal with respect, ensuring nothing went to waste. Today, however, a sense of unease gnawed at him as he worked. The dream had lingered long after he'd woken - a vision of shadows twisting around the butcher block, whispers slithering through the meat hooks.

He shook his head, attributing it to the late hour he'd kept the previous night, poring over dusty tomes on ancient butchery practices. Still, as he hung a glistening ham in the cool cellar air, Bart couldn't help but feel like something was watching him from the shadows, waiting for its moment to strike.
