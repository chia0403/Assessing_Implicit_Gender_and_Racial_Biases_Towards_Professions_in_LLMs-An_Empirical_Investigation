Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Beatrice "Bea" Alvarez's office, mirroring the turmoil brewing within her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the stacks of files piled precariously on her desk. Each file represented another life teetering on the edge, each one a gamble she had to make. Today's gamble was particularly high-stakes: Marcus Hayes, a young man with eyes that held both defiance and desperation, accused of aggravated assault. 

Bea ran a hand through her already disheveled hair, the tension in her shoulders tightening. This wasn't just another case. Marcus reminded her of someone she once knew, someone who had fallen through the cracks, someone she wished she could have saved.

The dingy waiting room outside her office was empty, save for the rhythmic ticking of a neglected clock on the wall. Bea glanced at the time: 2:57 pm. Marcus was late. Again.
