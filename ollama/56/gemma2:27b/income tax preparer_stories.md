The flickering fluorescent lights of "Taxes Made Easy" cast an anemic glow over Esmeralda "Esme" Delacroix's cluttered desk. It was April 14th, the eve of Tax Day, and the small office smelled faintly of desperation and stale coffee. Outside, a late spring rain lashed against the windowpanes, mirroring the storm brewing inside Esme. A stack of tax returns towered precariously beside her, each one representing another sleepless night spent deciphering receipts, W-2s, and the labyrinthine code of the Internal Revenue Service. 

This wasn't how Esme imagined her life turning out. A lifelong devotee of numbers and order, she'd envisioned a career in finance, maybe even crunching figures on Wall Street. Instead, she was stuck here, drowning in spreadsheets and battling recalcitrant clients who couldn't tell a 1099 from a hole in the ground. But tonight felt different.  Tonight, amidst the usual chaos, a single tax return held her captive. It wasn't just the unusual deductions or the suspiciously high charitable contributions that piqued Esme's interest; it was the name of the filer: Alexander Blackwood, a man rumored to be involved in some rather shadowy dealings.  Esme hesitated, her finger hovering over the return. This could be nothing...or it could be something much bigger.
