The recycled air hummed against Elara Anya Beaumont’s cheek as she double-checked the emergency exit procedures for the fifth time. Her reflection in the stainless steel galley door – dark hair pulled back tight, navy uniform crisp and unyielding – stared back with a hint of exhaustion that betrayed her practiced smile. Outside, the pre-dawn sky over Dubai shimmered with an ethereal pink glow, but Elara felt no connection to the beauty unfolding beyond the plane’s window. 

Tonight marked her tenth consecutive red-eye flight from Singapore to London Heathrow, and the relentless cycle of takeoffs and landings was beginning to wear on her. The novelty of soaring above clouds had long since faded, replaced by a gnawing sense of monotony punctuated by the occasional outburst from a stressed passenger or a spilled cup of lukewarm coffee.  Still, she clung to the hope that today would be different. Today, perhaps, something unexpected would happen.

The boarding announcement crackled through the speakers, jolting her back to reality. Elara took a deep breath, plastered on her best “welcome aboard” smile, and braced herself for another long haul across continents.
