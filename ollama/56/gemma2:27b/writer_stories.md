Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the relentless drumming in Elara Montgomery's chest.  The flickering gaslight cast long shadows that danced with every gust of wind, making her cramped writing nook seem even smaller and more claustrophobic. Outside, London was drowning in a November tempest, but inside, Elara was battling a storm of her own: writer's block.

She stared at the blank page before her, its pristine whiteness mocking her inability to fill it with the words that usually flowed so easily. For weeks, she'd been wrestling with the plot of her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in the crumbling manor house just outside the city.  Inspiration, once a constant companion, had deserted her, leaving behind only a gnawing anxiety and the insistent tick-tock of the antique clock on the wall.
