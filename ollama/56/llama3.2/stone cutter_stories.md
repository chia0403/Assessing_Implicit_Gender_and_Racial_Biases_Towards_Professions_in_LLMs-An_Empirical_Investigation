Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the cobblestone streets and half-timbered buildings that lined its narrow alleys. In a small workshop nestled between the town's old blacksmith and a bustling tavern, Elwes Stonewright carefully selected and sorted a batch of fine-grained limestone for his evening's work.

As he worked, the soft clinking of hammer on anvil echoed through the quiet night air, accompanied by the occasional snort or chuckle from the village folk who had gathered to watch Elwes at work. The stone cutter's hands moved with practiced ease, shaping and polishing the limestone into beautiful, intricate forms that would soon adorn the facades of Ravenshire's many churches and manor houses.

With a satisfied nod, Elwes laid down his tools for the night and stepped back to admire his handiwork - a stunning archway made from a single piece of gleaming white stone, its curves and twists perfectly suited to the ornate doorways that had come to be synonymous with Ravenshire's reputation as one of the finest towns in all the land. It was moments like these that Elwes felt most alive, surrounded by the beauty and craftsmanship that he had dedicated his life to creating.

But as he turned to shut down the workshop for the night, a faint sense of unease crept over him - a feeling that this particular evening might not be quite so ordinary after all.
