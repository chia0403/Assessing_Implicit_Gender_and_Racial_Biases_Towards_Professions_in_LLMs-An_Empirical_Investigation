Here's a story opening and setting:

The misty dawn broke over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, casting a mystical veil over its crumbling streets and weathered buildings. In the heart of this quaint village, nestled between towering oak trees and overgrown gardens, stood the imposing estate of Ashwood Manor.

Avery Everett Wells, the quiet and unassuming groundskeeper of Ashwood Manor, emerged from the darkness of his small wooden shed, blinking away the remnants of sleep. He rubbed the chill from his hands as he lit a cigarette, watching as the first hints of sunlight danced across the dew-kissed grass.

As Avery breathed in the crisp morning air, he gazed out upon the sprawling estate's meticulously manicured lawns and gardens, his eyes lingering on the overgrown rose bushes that seemed to whisper secrets to the wind. For years, Avery had tended to Ashwood Manor with precision and dedication, its labyrinthine paths and hidden corners a reflection of his own introspective nature.

But this morning was different. A sense of unease crept up Avery's spine as he noticed a faint rustling in the bushes near the manor's rear gate. He exhaled a slow stream of smoke, his mind racing with possibilities â€“ perhaps it was just a stray animal or a lost traveler seeking shelter from the chill. Yet, something about that noise seemed... off.

With an unshakeable feeling of foreboding, Avery flicked the cigarette into the underbrush and set off towards the manor's main house, his footsteps echoing through the stillness like a warning bell in the night. Little did he know, today would be a day that would shatter the tranquility of Ashwood Manor forever.
