Here's a possible story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the coast of Ravenswood Bay, shrouding the small coastal town in a damp, grey mist that clung to every surface like a damp cloth. It was a chill autumn evening, and Dr. Emily Victoria Wellesley stood at the edge of her windowsill, gazing out at the sea as she sipped a lukewarm cup of tea.

Inside the house, the fire crackled in the hearth, casting flickering shadows on the walls as the sound of waves crashing against the shore provided a soothing background hum. The smell of damp earth and salt filled the air, transporting Emily back to her childhood summers spent exploring the rugged coastline with her grandfather, a fisherman who had taught her the secrets of the sea.

As a surgeon, Emily was no stranger to life-or-death situations, but there was something about this particular evening that unsettled her. She felt a sense of unease, as if the town itself was holding its breath in anticipation of something - or someone.

Emily's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone ringing on the counter behind her. She turned to answer it, her eyes narrowing slightly as she saw the name flashing on the screen: "Ravenwood Hospital". The hospital where she worked as a leading surgeon, and where this evening was about to become a night she would never forget.
