Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel about an income tax preparer:

It was a crisp spring morning in late March, and the sun was just starting to peek over the rows of towering office buildings that lined Main Street in downtown Cedarville. The streets were still quiet, with only the occasional chirp of a bird or rumble of a passing car breaking the silence. In a small, unassuming office nestled between a vintage clothing store and a used bookstore, Emily Anne Jenkins was already up and at work.

Emily, a petite woman with short, curly brown hair and a warm smile, sat behind her desk, sipping on a cup of steaming coffee as she pored over the financial records of her latest client. As an income tax preparer, she had spent years honing her skills in crunching numbers and navigating the complexities of the tax code. But despite her expertise, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that this year's tax season was going to be anything but ordinary.

As she worked, Emily's mind wandered back to the strange phone call she'd received last night from an unknown number. The voice on the other end had been cryptic, but the words still lingered in her mind: "Meet me at the old warehouse at midnight. Come alone." Emily had tried to brush it off as a prank, but something about the tone had sent a shiver down her spine. She knew she should be wary of strangers, especially those who seemed to know more about her than she was comfortable with.

Just then, the phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, ringing loudly and shrill. Emily's heart skipped a beat as she hesitated for a moment before answering it, wondering what other surprises this day might bring.
