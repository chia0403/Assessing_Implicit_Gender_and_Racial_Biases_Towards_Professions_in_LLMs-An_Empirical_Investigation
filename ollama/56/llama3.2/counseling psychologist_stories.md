Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emily Alexandra Thompson stood at the edge of the lake, the crisp morning air whipping her dark brown hair into a frenzy as she gazed out across the serene water. The sun was just starting to rise over the trees, casting a golden glow over the tranquil scene before her. It was moments like these that reminded Emily why she had become a counseling psychologist in the first place - to help others find peace and healing in the midst of life's turmoil.

As she breathed in the fresh scent of pine and damp earth, Emily felt a sense of calm wash over her. She had spent countless hours on this very lake as a child, exploring its coves and inlets with her grandfather, who had been a park ranger here before his passing. Now, as a respected member of her community, Emily found solace in the familiar surroundings, knowing that they held memories and lessons that would continue to shape her work.

It was about to get a lot more complicated, though.

Just as she was starting to feel the tension ease from her shoulders, her phone buzzed in her pocket. She pulled it out, expecting a call from a client or perhaps another colleague checking in for a meeting. But instead, the screen displayed a name that made her heart skip a beat: Detective James "Hawk" Hawkins.

The detective's firm tone and urgent message sent a shiver down Emily's spine. "Dr. Thompson, I need to speak with you about something. Can we meet ASAP?"

Emily's mind was already racing with possibilities. She had known Hawk for years, ever since he'd transferred from the city to start working in her small town. He'd become like an old friend - a trusted ally who knew just how to push her buttons and challenge her thinking.

But what could have possibly gotten him calling at this hour? And why did Emily feel like she was about to embark on a journey that would shake the very foundations of her quiet, predictable life?

The questions swirled in her mind as she took a deep breath and turned back towards the lake, her eyes searching for some hint of what was to come.
