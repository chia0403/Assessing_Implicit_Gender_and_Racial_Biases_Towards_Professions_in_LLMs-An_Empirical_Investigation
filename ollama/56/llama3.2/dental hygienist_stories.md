As she scrubbed the last of the morning's dental patients from her mental schedule, Dr. Avery Elizabeth Thompson gazed out the window of her small practice in the sleepy coastal town of Oakdale, Maine. The misty dawn air clung to the rugged shoreline like a damp shroud, casting a mystical spell over the quaint community that had welcomed her with open arms when she arrived three years ago.

Avery, as she was known to her patients and colleagues, stood at the edge of her worn wooden desk, her eyes lost in thought as she sipped her lukewarm coffee. Her fingers absently drummed a soothing rhythm on the countertop, a habit formed from years of trying to calm the nerves of anxious children before their appointments.

As she pondered the day ahead, Avery's mind wandered back to the peculiar letter she had received the previous evening - an invitation to join a mysterious organization in her hometown, one that seemed to hold secrets and surprises beyond anything she could have imagined. The words "The Oakdale Circle" were emblazoned on the envelope in elegant cursive script, sending shivers down her spine.

Avery's gaze snapped back to the present as the door swung open, admitting a blast of chilly morning air and a cheerful smile from her assistant, Rachel. "Morning, boss! Ready for today?" Avery nodded, pushing aside the lingering unease that had settled in the pit of her stomach like a cold stone. She was a dental hygienist, not some kind of amateur sleuth - but as she watched Rachel lead the first patient into the exam room, Avery couldn't shake the feeling that this day was about to become anything but ordinary.
