Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Ravenswood, nestled deep within the heart of New England. The streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to find shelter from the rain. Amidst this quiet desperation, Emily Alexandra Winters, a determined and fiercely independent investigative reporter, stood outside the dilapidated old mansion on Willow Creek, her eyes fixed intently on the dark facade.

Emily, a native of Ravenswood with a burning passion for uncovering the truth, had spent years building a reputation as one of the town's most dogged and resourceful journalists. Her sharp instincts and razor-sharp mind had led to several high-profile exposés, exposing corruption and deceit in all its forms. But tonight, she was on her own, driven by a cryptic tip that hinted at a long-buried secret lurking within the crumbling walls of this foreboding estate.

As the wind whistled through the overgrown gardens, Emily felt an unsettling sense of unease settle over her. Something about this place didn't feel right – yet she couldn't quite put her finger on what it was. With a deep breath, she steeled herself and stepped forward into the darkness, the flickering glow of her phone's screen casting eerie shadows on the walls as she prepared to face whatever secrets Ravenswood had in store for her.
