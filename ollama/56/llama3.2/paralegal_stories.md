Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as Emily Jane Wilson, a seasoned paralegal with a keen eye for detail, walked into the dimly lit offices of her law firm, Harris & Associates. The soft hum of fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the rows of worn leather chairs and cluttered desks, each one bearing the weight of its own secrets.

Emily, a petite woman in her mid-thirties with piercing green eyes and shoulder-length brown hair, had spent the last decade honing her skills as a paralegal, working tirelessly to keep the wheels of justice turning for some of Seattle's most high-profile clients. Her no-nonsense attitude and razor-sharp mind made her an indispensable asset to the firm, but also kept her at arm's length from the more flashy lawyers who seemed to coast on their charm alone.

As she made her way to her own office, a cramped corner cubicle nestled between two larger suites, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The previous day had brought a flurry of activity, with clients clamoring for meetings and phone calls pouring in from an unknown number. And then there was the mysterious package that had arrived at the firm's front desk - a sleek, black briefcase with no return address and only a single word embossed on the leather lid: "EJW".
