Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of Oklahoma's Route 66, casting a warm orange glow over the desolate stretch of asphalt that stretched out before Jesse Clayton Thompson. As a member of the Oklahoma Department of Transportation's Highway Maintenance crew, Jesse knew every inch of this road by heart, and he took pride in keeping it in top condition for the thousands of travelers who passed through each year.

Jesse stood at the edge of the highway, his worn leather boots planted firmly on the ground as he surveyed the patchwork of potholes and uneven pavement that marred what was otherwise a well-maintained road. His eyes scanned the horizon, taking in the endless plains of brown grass and scrubby trees that seemed to stretch on forever.

It was going to be one of those days, Jesse thought to himself, as he checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time. The forecast had promised a storm by mid-morning, and he could already see dark clouds gathering on the horizon. He would need to get out here and make sure the crew's equipment was secure before the rain hit.

Just then, Jesse's radio crackled to life, breaking his train of thought. "Thompson, this is Dispatch. We've got a report of a multi-vehicle accident up ahead, near mile marker 57. You're clear for the job. Be careful out there."

Jesse's eyes narrowed as he turned to head towards the scene of the accident. This was going to be one busy day on Route 66.
