Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Rachel Alexandra Thompson stepped out of her office building and onto the sidewalk. The misty veil that shrouded the city seemed to match the melancholy mood that had settled over her since morning. As she lit a cigarette, the faint hum of the city's nightlife began to seep into her frazzled nerves.

Rachel was a sharp-tongued lawyer with a reputation for being one of the most ruthless litigators in the firm, but even she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been gnawing at her since the morning. A phone call from an old adversary had brought the news - Emily Wilson, the woman Rachel had lost years ago to a tragic accident, was now claiming that the negligence of another lawyer had led to that fateful night.

As she gazed up at the sleek glass tower where she worked, the neon lights of the city's nightlife seemed to mock her. It was going to be a long and treacherous road ahead, but Rachel Thompson was not one to back down from a challenge. Little did she know, this case would test every ounce of skill, empathy, and steel in her arsenal.

The streets were alive with strangers hurrying towards their destinations, oblivious to the turmoil brewing inside Rachel's chest. The rain showed no signs of letting up, and neither did Rachel's resolve.
