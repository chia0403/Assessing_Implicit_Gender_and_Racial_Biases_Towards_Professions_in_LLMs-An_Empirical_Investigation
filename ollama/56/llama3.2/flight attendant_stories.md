As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the sky, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling airport, Aurora Elara Vasquez began her pre-flight routine with a practiced efficiency that had become second nature to her. She sipped on a lukewarm cup of coffee as she made her way down the aisle, surveying the rows of seats and ensuring that everything was in order for the flight from New York to Los Angeles.

Aurora, or Rory as most people called her, had been a flight attendant for over five years, with the last four spent working for Skyline Airlines. She took pride in her work, always striving to provide exceptional service to her passengers, no matter what their destination or reason for travel. With a smile and a song, she would greet each passenger as they boarded, ready to make their journey just a little bit brighter.

As she checked the cabin's temperature and air pressure one last time, Rory couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. The flight was almost full, with only a few seats remaining on board, but there was an undercurrent of tension in the air, like a whispered secret shared among strangers. She pushed the thought aside, focusing instead on the tasks at hand as she made her way to the cockpit for final briefing with the captain.

The sun had long since set over the runway, and the plane's engines hummed softly as it prepared to take off into the night sky. Rory felt a thrill of excitement mixed with a pinch of nervousness as she took her seat in the cabin, ready to embark on another adventure alongside her passengers. Little did she know, this flight would be one that would change everything.
