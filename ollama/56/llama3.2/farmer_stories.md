Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was just starting to rise over the small farm, casting a warm glow over the fields and barns. Amelia "Amy" Jenkins woke up before dawn, as she always did, to tend to her daily chores. She stretched her arms and yawned, feeling the familiar ache in her back from years of lifting heavy buckets of feed and hauling water for the animals.

The farm, Greenhaven Acres, had been in Amy's family for generations. Her great-grandfather had started it as a small patch of land with a few cows and chickens, and over the years, it had grown into a thriving operation that produced everything from fresh vegetables to eggs and honey. Amy took pride in carrying on the tradition, working tirelessly to ensure that her farm remained not just sustainable but also economically viable.

As she made her way to the barn, Amy couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. She had received strange phone calls and emails in recent weeks, all of them with the same cryptic message: "The land remembers." At first, Amy had dismissed it as pranks from neighbors or disgruntled former employees, but the messages had continued to pile up, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

With a deep breath, Amy began her chores, trying to push the unease aside and focus on the day ahead. Little did she know, today would be different from any other day at Greenhaven Acres...
