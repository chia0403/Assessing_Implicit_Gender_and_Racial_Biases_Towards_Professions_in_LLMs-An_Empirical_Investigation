Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood Cove glistened like polished stone, reflecting the faint glow of streetlights that struggled to pierce the grey mist. Inside the cramped, dimly lit office above his plumbing shop, Emrys Rowan Flynn hunched over a stack of dusty blueprints, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. His thick, curly brown hair was mussed from a long day of fixing leaky faucets and unclogging drains for the town's eccentric residents.

As a fourth-generation plumber, Emrys had grown up surrounded by the hissing pipes, creaking shutters, and warm smell of sweat that came with keeping Ashwood Cove's plumbing system running smoothly. But despite the familiarity, he couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease had been growing inside him for weeks, like a slow-burning ember waiting to ignite.

Just as Emrys was about to pack up his things and head home, a shiver ran down his spine. He glanced out the window, where a faint flicker caught his attention - a small, dim light dancing across the roof of the old Victorian house on Elm Street. The house had been abandoned for years, its grandeur slowly being consumed by the ivy and neglect. But tonight, something seemed different.

Without thinking, Emrys grabbed his toolbox and headed out into the rain-soaked night, drawn to the mysterious light like a moth to flame. Little did he know, this chance encounter would set him on a path that would change his life forever.
