Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn crept over the crumbling walls of New Haven Prison, casting a damp shroud over the sprawling complex. Guard Edwin "Hawk" Hawkins stood at attention beside the entrance gate, his eyes fixed on the horizon as he waited for the first batches of inmates to arrive for the day's count.

New Haven Prison was a maximum-security facility, built in the late 1800s to hold the most violent and notorious felons in the country. It sat atop a rocky outcropping overlooking the dark waters of Blackwater Bay, its imposing structure seeming to pierce the sky like a jagged tooth.

Edwin Hawkins, or "Hawk" as he was known among the guards, had spent over a decade watching over the prison's notorious inmates. A gruff but fair man in his late 40s, Hawk took pride in his work, knowing that his presence helped keep the peace and maintain order within the prison's crumbling walls.

As the sun began to rise higher in the sky, casting a golden glow over the compound, Hawk radioed in the day's schedule: "Night watch reporting. All units accounted for, no signs of trouble yet." The response from dispatch crackled back through the comms, and Hawk stood tall, ready to face whatever challenges the day might bring.
