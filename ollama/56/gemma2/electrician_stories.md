The humid Georgia air clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin as he wrestled with the tangle of wires in the attic of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian home. Dust motes danced in the lone shaft of sunlight filtering through a grimy skylight, illuminating cobwebs thick as lace and a half-finished portrait of a stern-faced woman that had been abandoned decades ago.  

Elias swore under his breath as he tugged at a frayed wire, its insulation cracking like brittle bone. This old house was a nightmare. Not only did it groan with every creak and sigh, but the wiring was a chaotic mess, patched together by whoever'd held a screwdriver before him – and probably not very effectively. 

He wiped sweat from his brow, leaving a streak of grime on his forehead. A symphony of buzzing and crackling emanated from the tangled wires, a testament to their impending doom. Elias knew he had to untangle this mess before Mrs. Henderson came home, or she'd have a house full of sparks instead of lights. 


Elias Thorne wasn't just any electrician – he was the best damn problem-solver in Savannah, known for his lightning-fast reflexes and uncanny ability to tame even the wildest electrical beasts. But this old Victorian was proving to be a formidable opponent.
