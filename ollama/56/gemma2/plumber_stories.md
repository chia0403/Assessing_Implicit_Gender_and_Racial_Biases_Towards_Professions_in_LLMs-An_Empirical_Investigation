The air hung heavy with the scent of stagnant water and burnt toast in the cramped bathroom.  A thin layer of grime coated everything, from the cracked porcelain sink to the mildew-stained shower curtain. Reginald Bartholomew "Reggie" Plumbly, his brow slick with sweat, surveyed the scene with a grimace. It was going to be a long morning. 

Reggie was a master plumber in the heart of New Orleans, known for his quick wit and even quicker hands when it came to unclogging drains and fixing leaky pipes. But this bathroom, located on the top floor of a crumbling Victorian mansion in the French Quarter, was pushing him to his limits.  The plumbing seemed to defy the laws of physics, twisting and turning in ways that made Reggie wonder if someone had played Tetris with copper pipes while drunk. 


Outside, the humid air vibrated with the sounds of the city waking up: the rumble of trolleys, the rhythmic pulse of jazz spilling from a nearby bar, and the distant clang of a blacksmith's hammer. But inside this dilapidated bathroom, Reggie was trapped in a battle against time and plumbing gone rogue.
