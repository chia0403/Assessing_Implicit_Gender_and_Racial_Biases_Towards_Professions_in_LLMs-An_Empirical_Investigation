The air hung thick with the scent of stale perfume and cigarette smoke, a familiar aroma in the Grand Budapest Hotel.  Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick adjusted his cap, its brass buttons glinting under the dim chandelier light in the opulent lobby. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows through the towering stained-glass windows, painting abstract patterns on the Persian rugs that lay scattered across the polished mahogany floor. A gaggle of well-dressed tourists, their faces flushed from a day exploring the bustling city streets, crowded around the concierge desk, eager to be whisked away to their rooms.

Bart sighed, wiping his brow with the back of his gloved hand.  Another busy afternoon at the grand old dame, he thought, her age evident in the creaking floorboards and faded velvet curtains. He longed for a quiet corner, a cup of tea brewed strong enough to chase away the lingering scent of grandeur and decay that clung to every inch of the hotel. 


Bart's nametag, pinned neatly to his impeccably starched white uniform, felt heavy with responsibility.  He was more than just a bellhop at the Grand Budapest; he was the keeper of secrets, the silent observer of life unfolding within these ornate walls. And tonight, he had a feeling, something extraordinary was about to happen.
