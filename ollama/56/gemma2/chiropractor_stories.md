The scent of eucalyptus and lavender hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the biting February wind howling outside Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Thorne's office.  It was the kind of wind that clawed at exposed skin and threatened to rip shingles off roofs. 

Evelyn adjusted her glasses, peering at the X-ray on the lightbox. The fractured vertebrae in Mr. Henderson's lower back were a familiar sight â€“ another victim of Chicago's brutal winter. She sighed, tracing the jagged line with her finger.  She knew there was more to it than just a fall on icy pavement. Mr. Henderson, like most of her patients, carried the weight of their burdens in their bodies. 

Her office, tucked away on a quiet side street in Lincoln Park, was a sanctuary from the chaos of the city. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating the potted ferns and vibrant paintings on the walls. It was a place where people came to find relief, not just physical but emotional too. Evelyn believed that healing went beyond adjusting spines; it required listening, understanding, and sometimes, simply offering a kind word.  


The chime above the door tinkled, announcing her next patient. A young woman with tired eyes and slumped shoulders entered, seeking refuge from the storm both outside and within.
