The air in the shack hummed with the low thrum of static, punctuated by bursts of interference that crackled like lightning across Amelia Rose Carter's headphones. Outside, the wind whipped around the rusted metal building, rattling the windowpanes and sending shivers down her spine. The storm had been raging for hours, isolating her tiny radio station nestled on the edge of the desolate Nevada desert. 

Amelia adjusted the dials on the ancient transmitter, her brow furrowed in concentration. She was alone, as always. Even the local owls seemed to have sought shelter from the fury outside.  The silence between transmissions stretched, thick and heavy like the storm clouds gathering overhead. It wasn't loneliness she felt, not exactly. It was more a profound sense of isolation, a feeling of being adrift in a vast expanse where human connection was a fading echo.


That is until the signal arrived. A faint whisper, garbled and distorted, but undeniably there. Amelia leaned closer to the receiver, her heart quickening. This wasn't local interference, this was something different, something... unexpected.
