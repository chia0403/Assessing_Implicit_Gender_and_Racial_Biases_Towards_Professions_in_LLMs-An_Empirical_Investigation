The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elara Jade Rivers' back as she surveyed her domain: mile marker 172 of Interstate 10, a ribbon of asphalt stretching out like an endless desert scar. Dust devils pirouetted in the shimmering heat haze, and the only sound besides the wind whistling through the scrub brush was the rhythmic thump of Elara's hammer against the cracked concrete. It was her fourth year with the Arizona Department of Transportation, and she knew this stretch of highway like the back of her hand: every pothole, every loose guardrail, every tumbleweed-wrought crater.  

Today, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up Elara's spine, a subtle shift in the air that made her pause, hammer suspended mid-swing. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the highway, painting the dusty landscape in hues of burnt orange and violet. Beyond the shimmering heat waves, distant mountains loomed, their jagged peaks silhouetted against the darkening sky. The familiar hum of traffic had faded to a whisper as dusk settled over the desert.
