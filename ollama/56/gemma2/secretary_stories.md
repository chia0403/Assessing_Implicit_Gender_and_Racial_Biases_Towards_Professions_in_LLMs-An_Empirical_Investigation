The rhythmic clatter of Agnes Beatrice Perkins’s fingers on the keys was the only sound breaking the oppressive silence of Mr. Davenport’s office. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the cluttered mahogany desk. Papers piled high like miniature mountains, each one bearing a stamp that read "Undelivered" with an ominous red ink. Agnes sighed, pushing back her auburn bun and adjusting her wire-rimmed spectacles. 

Mr. Davenport was notorious for his mountain of unread correspondence, a testament to his aversion to anything resembling efficiency. It wasn't that he lacked the capacity for it; on rare occasions, when a particularly pressing matter demanded attention, Mr. Davenport could be remarkably swift and decisive. But for the most part, he preferred to exist in a blissful state of bureaucratic inertia, allowing Agnes to navigate the labyrinthine world of his affairs while he indulged in his eccentric hobbies – falconry being the latest.

Agnes glanced at the clock, its hands inching closer to three o'clock. If she didn't find a way to crack through Mr. Davenport’s backlog soon, his entire year would be devoured by an avalanche of unresponded letters. And Agnes knew that when chaos reigned in Mr. Davenport’s office, it inevitably spread like wildfire throughout the prestigious firm they worked for.
