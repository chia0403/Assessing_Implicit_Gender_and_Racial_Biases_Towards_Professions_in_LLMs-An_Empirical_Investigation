The rain hammered against Dr. Evelyn Ashworth's window, mimicking the relentless drumming in her own head.  She sat perched on the edge of her worn leather armchair, staring at the half-empty cup of chamomile tea that had long gone cold. Her office, usually a haven of calming pastels and soft lighting, felt suffocating tonight. The silence, punctuated only by the rain's insistent rhythm, amplified the echo of her own thoughts – thoughts she desperately wanted to quiet but couldn't seem to silence.

Evelyn, a clinical psychologist with a reputation for unwavering empathy and insightful diagnoses, found herself facing an unsettling predicament: she was struggling to help her own patients. The city felt heavier than usual, burdened by a palpable unease that seemed to seep into the very air they breathed. Her clients, typically seeking solace and guidance, arrived on her doorstep consumed by a pervasive fear and anxiety she couldn't decipher.  

Her own anxieties mirrored theirs. She felt adrift in a sea of uncertainty, grappling with an inexplicable sense of impending doom. The city, usually teeming with life, now seemed shrouded in a palpable darkness. A darkness that was slowly consuming everything – her patients, herself, perhaps even the city itself. 


This was Chicago, but not the vibrant, pulsating metropolis she knew. This was a city on edge, teetering on the precipice of something unknown and terrifying.  And Evelyn, armed with her knowledge and compassion, was about to find out just how deep that darkness went.
