The humid Atlanta air clung to Amelia "Amy" Harper like a second skin as she stepped out of her beat-up Honda Civic.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, blurring the neon glare of the pawn shop sign across the street. Even at 8:00 AM, the Georgia sun was already casting long shadows and warping the world into an almost surreal haze. Amy adjusted the strap of her briefcase, its worn leather a familiar comfort against her hip. She hated mornings like this, where the air felt thick with unspoken secrets and the promise of trouble.  

This particular pawn shop, nestled on a forgotten side street in Cabbagetown, had been notorious for years. Whispers of shady deals and stolen goods swirled around it like dust devils. But today was different. Today, Amy wasn't here for gossip or intrigue. She was here on a job: to assess the damage claim for Mr. Jeremiah Finch, an elderly man who claimed his late wife's antique locket had been stolen during a botched robbery attempt.
