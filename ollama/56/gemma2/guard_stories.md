The cobblestones beneath Sergeant Alistair Thorne's boots were slick with a recent rain, reflecting the sickly yellow glow emanating from the gas lamps lining Citadel Square. Above, the storm clouds hung low, promising another deluge soon, mirroring the churning in Alistairâ€™s stomach. He tugged his worn cloak tighter around him, fighting off the chill that seeped through even the thick wool. His breath puffed out in white wisps, swallowed by the fog that clung to the square like a shroud. 

Alistair, known by most as Thorne, was one of the last remaining guards still patrolling the Citadel after curfew.  The city itself had been gripped by an oppressive fear for weeks, ever since whispers of a shadow creature preying on citizens began circulating. No one dared venture out after dusk, and even during the day, faces wore masks of anxious vigilance. Tonight, Thorne felt that fear acutely. The silence was broken only by the dripping of rain and the distant, mournful wail of a street musician, his melody swallowed by the fog like a whispered secret.


He stopped at the foot of the Citadel's towering gates, their iron bars cold against his gloved hand. He knew every inch of these walls, every creak of the hinges, every flicker in the torches lining the ramparts. Yet tonight, they felt alien and hostile.  The shadow creature, they called it. No one truly knew what it was, only that it hunted in the dark, leaving behind a trail of terror and empty eyes. The thought sent a shiver down his spine. He pressed his hand against the cold metal of the gate, a silent plea for strength. His duty lay here, on these walls, guarding the city from whatever darkness lurked beyond.
