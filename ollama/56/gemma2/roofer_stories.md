The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Barnacle Bart" Callahan's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his sweat into stinging rivers that ran down his temples. He hunched over the edge of the shingled roof, meticulously nailing down the final row of cedar tiles. The rhythmic clang of his hammer was the only sound besides the distant whine of cicadas and the occasional screech of a hawk circling above. 

He worked on a modest two-story Victorian in Fairhaven, a quaint seaside town nestled between rolling green hills and crashing waves on the Atlantic coast.  Bart loved Fairhaven â€“ its history whispered through the cobblestone streets, its salty air filled his lungs with invigorating freshness, and the people were as warm and weathered as the shingles he painstakingly repaired.  

Today, however, the heat was relentless. Bart wiped his brow with a grimy rag, his eyes squinting at the shimmering horizon where the sky met the restless ocean. The job should have been finished hours ago, but a stubborn leak beneath the eaves had delayed him, turning this seemingly simple repair into an unexpected puzzle. 


As he reached for another nail, a flicker of movement in the garden below caught Bart's eye.  He squinted, unsure if it was just a playful squirrel or something more... curious.
