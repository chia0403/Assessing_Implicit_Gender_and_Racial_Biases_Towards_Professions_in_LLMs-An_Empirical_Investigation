The scent of lavender and lilac hung heavy in the air, clinging to Emelia Rosethorn's fingers as she meticulously stitched pearl buttons onto a midnight-blue satin gown. Sunlight streamed through the leaded windows of her workshop, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm glow and painting shimmering rainbows on the bolts of silk lining the walls. Outside, the cobbled streets of Ashton Hollow hummed with the quiet energy of a late summer afternoon. Birdsong trilled amidst the clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the murmur of distant conversation. 

But Emelia wasn't listening. Her world was contained within the four walls of her workshop, a sanctuary of fabrics, needles, and thread. The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her needle against the fabric was the only sound that mattered, each stitch a silent prayer woven into the delicate tapestry of the gown. 


It was the Duchess's wedding dress, commissioned months ago, and Emelia felt the weight of expectation pressing down on her like the heavy velvet drapes she sometimes used to shade her work from the afternoon sun. This wasn't just any dress; it was a symbol of Ashton Hollow's prestige, a testament to its burgeoning prosperity. And Emelia, with her nimble fingers and keen eye for detail, was entrusted with making it perfect.
