The stale scent of jasmine tea lingered in Amelia Beatrice Finch's office, a faint counterpoint to the cloying sweetness of desperation that hung thick in the air. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the torrential downpour of emotions brewing inside her clients.

Amelia, with her perpetually wind-tossed auburn hair and spectacles perched precariously on her nose, surveyed the scene: a frazzled couple, their faces pale and etched with worry; a solitary backpacker, hunched over his guidebook, muttering to himself; and a gaggle of teenagers, buzzing with restless energy and an unsettling lack of focus. 

Her office, nestled above a bustling bakery on a cobblestone street in Prague's Old Town, was usually a haven for wanderlust and excitement. Today, it felt more like a waiting room for heartbreak. Every cancelled flight, every border closure, every shattered dream whispered through the cramped space, leaving Amelia with an ache in her chest that had nothing to do with travel sickness. 


This wasn't just another Tuesday for Amelia Beatrice Finch; this was the day she had to figure out how to sell magic in a world where everything felt increasingly ordinary.
