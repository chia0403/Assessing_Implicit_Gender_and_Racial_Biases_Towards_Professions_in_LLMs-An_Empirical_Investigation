The fluorescent lights hummed above Isabella "Izzy" Reyes, casting an anemic glow over the cluttered waiting room. Magazines with dog-eared pages and faded smiles lined the shelves, their advice on healthy living seeming laughably ironic in this sterile purgatory of fear and discomfort. Izzy adjusted her navy scrubs, the crisp cotton a stark contrast to the clammy air that hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and nervous sweat.  She hated mornings. Hated the way people's faces tightened into grimace masks before they even reached her station. Hated the way their veins seemed to vanish into thin air when she needed them most. But there was something strangely comforting about the ritual, the practiced choreography of drawing blood, a tiny act of defiance against the invisible enemy that lurked within each patient's body. 


The clinic was nestled in the heart of El Paso, Texas, a sprawling city where the desert sun beat down relentlessly on dusty streets. Its faded paint and chipped linoleum floor seemed to mirror the weariness etched on the faces of those who came seeking solace within its walls. It wasn't much, but for Izzy, it was home.
