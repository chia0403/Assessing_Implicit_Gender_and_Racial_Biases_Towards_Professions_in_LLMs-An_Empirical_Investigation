The scent of iron mingled with the sweet tang of blood hung thick in the air of "Carter's Cut," a small butchershop tucked away on a cobbled side street in the old city of Dunwich. Sunlight streamed through the dusty shop window, illuminating rows of glistening sausages and slabs of cured ham hanging like forgotten ornaments from the ceiling.  

At the center of it all stood Silas Carter, his broad hands stained crimson as he carefully trimmed the fat from a plump leg of lamb. His thick arms, corded with muscle honed by years of wielding cleavers and saws, moved with an almost practiced grace. The air around him hummed with an unspoken energy, a mix of raw power and quiet contemplation that both drew people in and made them hesitate at the threshold. 

Silas Carter wasn't just any butcher. He was whispered about in hushed tones, his name carried on the wind as both legend and cautionary tale. Some called him "The Butcher of Dunwich," a moniker born from the uncanny skill with which he could discern the story within each animal he laid to rest. Others spoke of a darkness that clung to him, an unsettling aura that seemed to deepen with every cut. 


He had never sought fame or notoriety, but in a city steeped in ancient lore and shadowed by secrets, Silas Carter found himself at the heart of it all, wielding his cleaver as both instrument and catalyst.
