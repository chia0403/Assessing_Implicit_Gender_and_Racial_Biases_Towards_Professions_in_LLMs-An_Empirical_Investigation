The air hung thick with the scent of sizzling garlic and desperation. Isabella "Izzy" Flores wiped her hands on her already stained apron, hoping to banish the lingering taste of burnt crème brûlée from her mouth. It wasn't the usual Friday night chaos at The Rusty Spoon – usually it was more boisterous laughter than hushed whispers and tense glances exchanged between couples. But tonight, a cold, unsettling quiet settled over the once lively diner.  

The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting an eerie green light across the worn linoleum floor of The Rusty Spoon. A lone trucker sat hunched in a corner booth, his gaze fixed on the empty coffee cup before him. At the counter, two teenagers huddled together, their eyes glued to their phones, ignoring the melancholic jazz playing softly from the old jukebox. 

Izzy straightened her shoulders and plastered a smile on her face, pushing down the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. Tonight was her last shift before moving across the state, leaving behind The Rusty Spoon and everything she’d ever known. She just hoped it wouldn't be another night that ended with an empty tip jar and a heavier heart.
