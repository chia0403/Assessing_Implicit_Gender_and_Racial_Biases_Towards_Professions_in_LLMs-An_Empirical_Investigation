The scent of roasted almonds and freshly brewed chai hung heavy in the air of "Nourish," Amelia Rose Peterson's bustling wellness center. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm glow and casting long shadows across the mismatched furniture â€“ vintage armchairs upholstered in floral patterns, a repurposed library table serving as the consultation desk, and a comfy corner sofa adorned with plump cushions perfect for post-meal relaxation. Amelia, her auburn braid swinging against her crisp white apron, wiped down the counter, her eyes scanning the room. 

It was Wednesday morning, usually her busiest time, but today felt different. An air of anxious anticipation hung in the space, a palpable buzz beneath the usual cheerful hum.  Amelia knew something was coming, she just didn't know what. The feeling settled in her stomach like a nervous butterfly, its wings fluttering against her ribs.
