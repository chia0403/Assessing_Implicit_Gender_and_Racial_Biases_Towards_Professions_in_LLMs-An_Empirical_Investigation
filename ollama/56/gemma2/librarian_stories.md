The air in the Grand Blackwood Library hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and lemon polish. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight piercing through the high arched windows, illuminating swirling patterns on the worn wooden floor. The silence was absolute, broken only by the soft rustle of pages turning as Amelia Thistlewood meticulously rearranged a shelf of Victorian poetry. 

Amelia, with her auburn braids threaded with silver and spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, had spent the last thirty years nurturing this haven of words, a sanctuary for both knowledge seekers and dreamers. The library was her kingdom, its towering shelves crammed with stories spanning centuries, each volume whispering tales of adventure, love, loss, and everything in between. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on Amelia’s skin, like the first whisper of a storm brewing on a still summer day.  


The feeling intensified when she noticed a faint, unfamiliar scent mingling with the library’s familiar aroma – a hint of woodsmoke and something metallic, unsettlingly alien.
