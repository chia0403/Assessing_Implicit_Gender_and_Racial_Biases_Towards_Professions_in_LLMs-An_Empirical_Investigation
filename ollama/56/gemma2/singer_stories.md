The air in The Blue Moon was thick with cigarette smoke and cheap perfume, the kind that clung to you like a second skin. Neon signs flickered, casting long, distorted shadows on the sticky floor where Ava Rosalind Starlight – known simply as Ava Star to the dwindling crowd –  was prepping for her set. Her guitar, "Luna," lay across her knees, its worn wood familiar and comforting beneath her fingertips. 

Ava's voice was a smoky alto, capable of both heartbreaking vulnerability and raw, unfiltered power. Tonight, though, it felt strained, choked by the weight of unspoken anxieties. The Blue Moon, once a bustling hub for local talent, was now teetering on the brink of closure. Ava’s loyal fanbase, a ragtag group of regulars who'd weathered countless storms with her, were dwindling faster than she could replace them.  

She took a deep breath, trying to quell the knot in her stomach. This wasn’t just about saving a bar; it was about proving something to herself. She yearned for the days when music felt like magic, a shared experience that transcended the grime and despair of their little corner of the world.  


Tonight, she hoped, she could find some of that magic again.
