The bell above the door to "Apothecary & Acorns" chimed merrily as Eleanor Rosalind Beaumont adjusted her spectacles and peered over the counter. The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and chamomile, mingled with a hint of cinnamon from the pumpkin spice lattes brewing in the back room. Outside, rain lashed against the quaint storefront windows, blurring the colorful autumn leaves scattered across the cobblestone street.

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. It wasn't often that customers ventured out on days like this.  Most preferred to huddle by their fireplaces with a good book and a cup of something warm. But today was different. Today, someone needed her.
