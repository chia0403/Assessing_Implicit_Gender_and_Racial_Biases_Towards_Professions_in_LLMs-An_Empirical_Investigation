The sun beat down on Elias "Big Eli" McAlister's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat trickling down his temple and stinging his eyes. He squinted at the sprawling construction site before him, dust motes dancing in the shimmering air like miniature tornadoes.  

He sat perched atop his Caterpillar 345F excavator, its massive hydraulic arms moving with practiced grace as he meticulously scraped away layers of clay to expose bedrock for the new highway foundation. The rhythmic clang of metal on earth was a familiar symphony, a soundtrack to Big Eli's life. This wasn't just a job; it was an extension of himself, a dance between man and machine, raw power channeled into order.  

But today, something felt different. A tension hummed beneath the surface of the usual cacophony - a low murmur amongst the workers, nervous glances exchanged. Big Eli caught snippets of conversation: "New boss..." "Stricter rules..." "Layoffs..." 

He shrugged it off, focusing on his task. There was always talk, whispers swirling like desert winds.  But this time, a knot of unease tightened in his gut, a premonition that the familiar rhythm of his life was about to change.
