The air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and damp earth. Dew clung to Augustus Percival Thistlewick's brow like tiny, glittering diamonds as he surveyed his domain: the sprawling gardens of Blackwood Manor. Each rose bush was meticulously pruned, each patch of lavender fragrantly bursting, every path swept clean. A symphony of buzzing bees and chirping birds filled the morning air, a melody that Augustus knew by heart. 

He paused, tilting his head towards the towering oak tree at the center of the gardens. Its gnarled branches stretched towards the sky like ancient arms, whispering secrets in the breeze.  Augustus had spent his entire life tending to these grounds, inheriting the post from his father and grandfather before him. Blackwood Manor was more than just a place; it was his legacy, his responsibility, his sanctuary. 


Today, however, a strange tension hummed beneath the usual tranquil rhythm. A sense of foreboding lingered in the air, heavy as the morning mist. Augustus couldn't quite place it, but something felt different.  Something had changed.
