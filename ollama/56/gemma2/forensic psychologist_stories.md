The stale air in the interrogation room hung thick with the weight of unspoken truths. Dr. Eleanor Vance adjusted her spectacles, their frames glinting under the harsh fluorescent light. The subject, a young man named Lucas Thorne, stared ahead, his face a mask of impassivity. He had been silent for the past hour, his only response to Eleanor's probing questions being a slow blink and the occasional nervous twitch of his fingers. 

Eleanor glanced at the file on her lap: "Lucas Thorne, 24, suspected arsonist, history of petty theft." The case was perplexing. The fire that had engulfed the local bakery last week seemed deliberately set, yet there was no clear motive. Lucas had denied involvement, but something in his demeanor, a subtle shift in his pupils when she mentioned the smell of burnt sugar, hinted at a hidden truth.

The interrogation room itself was a sterile space designed to elicit confessions. The stark white walls, unforgiving steel table, and single barred window offered no comfort or escape. It sat within the imposing brick building of the Blackwood County Police Department, a hulking structure that loomed over the quiet town like a watchful sentinel.  


The town itself – Maple Creek – was nestled in the heart of rural Maine, a place where secrets festered beneath a veneer of idyllic charm. Eleanor had grown up there, and despite its tranquility, she knew its shadows held darkness. This case felt personal, a challenge to unravel the hidden complexities within her own community.
