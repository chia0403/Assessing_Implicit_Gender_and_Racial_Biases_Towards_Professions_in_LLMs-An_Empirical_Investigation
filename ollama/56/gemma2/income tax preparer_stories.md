The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Persephone Bellweather's head, casting a sterile glow on the stacks of crumpled receipts and half-eaten granola bars littering her desk.  Her small office, tucked away in a strip mall between a laundromat and a vacant storefront, smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation – the intoxicating aroma of tax season. It was March 12th, two weeks before the deadline, and Amelia was knee-deep in W-2s and 1099s, her fingers stained with ink from meticulously filling out forms. Outside, a steady drizzle mirrored the melancholy she felt as another year's worth of dreams, anxieties, and financial missteps were laid bare before her.

She longed for the crisp autumn air of her favorite hiking trails, for the quiet comfort of her grandmother's kitchen, but duty called. This year, though, felt different. There was a gnawing unease beneath the familiar exhaustion, a sense that something was off, like a discordant note in the symphony of tax season chaos. She couldn't quite place it, but a shiver ran down her spine as she glanced at the pile of unopened mail on her desk. The envelopes held names she knew well, faces she could picture clearly – and some whose stories were yet to be told.
