The muted beige walls of Dr. Amelia Hayes' office did little to mask the storm brewing outside. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the relentless hammering in her chest. Each drumbeat echoed her internal monologue: "He doesn't want to talk. He never wants to talk."  

Amelia stared at the man seated opposite her, a young veteran named David Miller, his face a tight mask of unreadable emotions. His file spoke volumes - PTSD, anxiety, social withdrawal – but Amelia craved the human connection beyond the labels. The silence stretched between them, thick and heavy with unspoken words. 

She knew she couldn't force him to open up. But somewhere beneath the surface, she sensed a glimmer of vulnerability, a flicker of hope that he might be ready to let go, even if just a little.  

The small, cluttered office felt like a sanctuary in the heart of Chicago, a world away from the tempestuous city outside and the internal turmoil David battled within himself. The scent of lavender hand sanitizer lingered in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of old books from the shelf lining one wall – a collection Amelia had amassed over years, each volume holding a story waiting to be told, a lesson learned, a path walked. 


Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for another round of this delicate dance. "David," she began, her voice soft but firm, "Sometimes, the hardest part is just beginning to speak."
