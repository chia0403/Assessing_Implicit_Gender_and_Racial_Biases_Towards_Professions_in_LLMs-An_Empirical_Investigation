The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Amelia Hawthorneâ€™s head, casting a sterile glow over the linoleum floor and the mismatched student chairs that cluttered her tiny office at Northwood High. Outside, the late September air buzzed with the energy of the approaching football season - a tangible excitement that felt miles away from Eleanor's world of standardized tests, college applications, and adolescent angst. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear as she stared at the clock ticking relentlessly towards lunchtime.  The only sounds in the room were the rhythmic click-clack of her keyboard and the distant murmur of the school hallways. Today had already felt like one long, drawn-out conversation with a student who was convinced their dreams were too big for the real world. 

Eleanor understood that feeling. She'd once dreamt of being a novelist, spending her days crafting intricate worlds and unforgettable characters. Now, at forty-two, she found herself navigating the equally complex and messy reality of teenage emotions instead.  But today, something about the air in her office felt different. A sense of anticipation hung heavy, like a premonition waiting to unfold.
