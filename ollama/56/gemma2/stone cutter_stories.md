The dust hung thick in the air, swirling like tiny motes of gold in the sliver of sunlight that pierced through the grime-caked workshop window. Elias Thorne, his hands calloused from years of shaping granite and limestone, wiped sweat from his brow with a forearm dusted in chalky fragments. He ran the damp cloth over his face, the coarse fabric doing little to ease the ache behind his eyes. The air was thick not just with dust, but with the cloying scent of oil and the metallic tang of freshly cut stone. 

Elias' workshop lay nestled at the base of Blackheart Mountain, a looming granite giant that cast a long shadow over their humble town of Hollow Creek. It was a place where time moved slower, measured by the ebb and flow of the quarry work and the steady rhythm of hammer against stone. Elias, like most men in Hollow Creek, had been born into this life, the legacy of generations passed down through calloused hands and weathered faces.  


His workshop, once his father's, was cluttered with tools: chisels of every size, mallets worn smooth by countless blows, a vise that groaned under the weight of half-finished projects. In the corner, nestled amongst bundles of rough-hewn stone, stood a single pedestal, its surface polished to a mirror sheen. This was where Elias worked his magic, transforming the raw, unyielding nature of the mountain into objects of beauty and purpose: headstones for the departed, memorial plaques for heroes lost, sculptures that captured the ephemeral essence of life itself. Today, he was working on something different, something that felt heavier than any stone he had ever handled. A commission from a merchant in the distant city, a mysterious figure who promised wealth beyond imagination.  This project, Elias knew, could change everything.
