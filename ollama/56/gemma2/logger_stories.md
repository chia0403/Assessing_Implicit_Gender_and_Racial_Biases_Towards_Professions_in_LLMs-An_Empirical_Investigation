The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Thaddeus "Tad" Blackwood as he stepped out of his cabin.  Sunlight filtered through the towering redwoods, casting dappled shadows on the forest floor. The early morning mist clung to the moss-covered trees, whispering secrets in the gentle breeze. 

Tad adjusted the brim of his battered Stetson and squinted at the sky. A faint blush was creeping across the horizon, promising a day as bright as it would be demanding. He stretched his long limbs, feeling the familiar ache in his back from yesterday's haul.  His calloused hands instinctively reached for the worn leather handle of his axe, a tool more familiar to him than his own reflection. 


Today was another day in the Siskiyou Mountains of Oregon, where giants fell and mountains sighed under the weight of ancient secrets. Today was another day for Tad Blackwood, logger extraordinaire.
