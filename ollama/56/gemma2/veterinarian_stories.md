The biting wind whipped Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Thorne’s crimson coat around her ankles as she navigated the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh. Rain lashed down, turning the ancient stones slick with a sheen that mirrored the city's history: centuries of stories etched in the very pavement beneath her boots. Overhead, the gas lamps flickered like weary fireflies, casting long shadows that danced and twisted in the swirling mist. 

Evelyn, the city's beloved avian veterinarian, adjusted her spectacles, her focus not on the stormy backdrop but on the small, fluttering form clutched within her leather satchel. Inside, a sparrow, no bigger than her thumb, shivered uncontrollably, its tiny breaths like whispers against the fabric lining. It was just past midnight, and she had received an urgent call - another injured bird, brought to her doorstep by a worried resident who’d found it entangled in discarded fishing line. 

Evelyn sighed, a deep rumble in her chest that echoed the city's own melancholy sigh under the stormy sky. The sparrow's fate hung precariously in the balance, and Evelyn knew she had little time to save it. Each beat of its fragile heart was a plea for her expertise, a silent request to bring light back into its dimming world.
