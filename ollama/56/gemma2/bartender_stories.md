The amber glow of the Edison bulbs cast long shadows across Elara “Ellie” Blackwood’s weathered mahogany bar. A haze of cigar smoke and spilled whiskey hung in the air, thick enough to cut with a rusty knife. The clinking of glasses and the muffled murmur of conversations provided a constant soundtrack to the symphony of late-night New Orleans. 

Elara, her dark hair pulled back tight from her face, wiped down the counter with practiced ease, her gaze sweeping over the familiar faces that populated this corner of Bourbon Street. She knew them all: old men nursing their loneliness, couples on the verge of implosion, and wide-eyed tourists yearning for a taste of the real city. Tonight, however, there was an unusual tension in the air, a palpable shift in the rhythm of the bar that had Ellie’s antennae twitching. 


The door swung open with a familiar creak, letting in a gust of humid night air and a stranger unlike any Elara had seen before. He stood tall, clad in a dark trench coat that seemed to swallow him whole, his face hidden in the shadows of a wide-brimmed fedora.
