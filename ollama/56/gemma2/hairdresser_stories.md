The bell above the door tinkled its usual cheery welcome as Eleanor Beatrice Finch, or Ellie as everyone knew her, meticulously swept stray hairs from the salon floor. The air was thick with the scent of coconut shampoo and freshly brewed coffee, a comforting blend familiar to her after fifteen years running "Ellie's Enchanted Cuts" on Elm Street. 

Outside, the autumn leaves were already ablaze in fiery reds and oranges, painting the quaint, cobblestone street in hues that mirrored the warm, inviting glow emanating from within Ellie's salon. But the usual buzz of chatter and clippers was unusually absent this Friday afternoon.  Even the constant hum of the blow dryer seemed subdued, a disconcerting silence hanging heavy in the air. 

Ellie glanced at the clock, its hands creeping closer to four o'clock. Where were all her regulars? Had something spooked them away? The only explanation that came to mind was the peculiar, unsettling fog rolling in from the west, an eerie mist that seemed to swallow the vibrant colours of the day and replace them with a muted, spectral grey.
