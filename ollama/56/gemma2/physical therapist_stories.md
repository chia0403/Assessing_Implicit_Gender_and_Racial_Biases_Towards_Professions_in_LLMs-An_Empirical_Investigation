The scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender essential oil diffusing from a small ceramic elephant perched on Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood's desk. Sunlight streamed through the windows of her private practice, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the otherwise sterile space.  Her walls were adorned with nature photographs – serene beaches, snow-capped mountains, lush forests – a stark contrast to the clinical environment.

Ellie ran a hand over the worn leather of her favorite massage ball, a tool as familiar to her as her own heartbeat. She’d built this practice from the ground up, brick by painstaking brick, years ago after graduating top of her class at NYU's renowned physical therapy program. It was a haven for patients seeking relief from chronic pain, sports injuries, and life's myriad ailments. 

Today, though, Ellie felt a knot of unease tightening in her chest. The usual calm that enveloped her during treatment sessions was absent.  A sense of foreboding lingered, whispering that something wasn’t quite right. It seemed to stem from the newest patient on her schedule – a reclusive author with a spine as rigid as his prose, rumored to be haunted by shadows from his past.
