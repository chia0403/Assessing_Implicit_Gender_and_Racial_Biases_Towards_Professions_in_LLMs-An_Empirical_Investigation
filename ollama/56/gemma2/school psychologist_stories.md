The fluorescent lights hummed over Eleanor Kensington's head like a chorus of weary bees. Her reflection in the glass door to her office at Willow Creek Middle School flickered, distorted by the dusty sheen on the pane. It was another Tuesday afternoon, and the air hung thick with the scent of stale pizza and simmering adolescent angst. 

Eleanor sighed, adjusting the silver wire-rimmed glasses perched precariously on her nose. Today's schedule was a doozy: a seventh-grader struggling with crippling test anxiety, an eighth-grader accused of cyberbullying, and a fifth-grade boy who insisted his pet goldfish was sending him secret messages.  Typical Tuesday at Willow Creek. 

The bell signaling the end of class echoed through the halls, ushering in a wave of noise â€“ slammed lockers, chattering students, and the occasional shriek of frustrated teenage rebellion. Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for another dive into the emotional minefield that was middle school. Today, she'd need all her patience and empathy.
