The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that clashed violently with the metallic tang of blood seeping into the pristine white carpet. Amelia Thorne-Whitley, CEO of ThorneTech Industries and one of the most formidable women in Silicon Valley, stared down at the body sprawled across her office floor. A single crimson stain blossomed on the crisp white shirt of a man she'd only known as "The Consultant," his eyes wide with an unsettling mix of fear and disbelief. 

Her penthouse office, overlooking the glittering expanse of San Francisco, was now a crime scene. The panoramic windows offered a breathtaking view of the city, but Amelia couldn’t appreciate it. All she could see was the twisted metal of her antique sculpture, shattered beside the body, its bronze curves reflecting the harsh neon lights that pulsed through the fog-choked night.  

The air hummed with the quiet chaos of arriving police officers and forensics investigators. A knot of anxiety tightened in Amelia's chest, squeezing the air from her lungs. This wasn't a boardroom meeting, this wasn't a hostile takeover bid – this was real, raw, and utterly terrifying. She had built her empire on calculated risks and cold logic, but now, she found herself face-to-face with an unpredictable force that threatened to unravel everything she held dear.
