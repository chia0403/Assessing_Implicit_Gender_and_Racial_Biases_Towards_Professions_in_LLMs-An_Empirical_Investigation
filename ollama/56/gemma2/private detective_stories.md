Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's office, mirroring the torrent of anxieties brewing inside him. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation - a familiar aroma in his line of work. Outside, the neon glow of the city reflected in puddles on the rain-slicked pavement, casting grotesque shadows that danced to the tune of the relentless downpour.

Bart's office was a cramped affair tucked away on the third floor of an aging building in downtown Noirhaven, a metropolis perpetually shrouded in a haze of urban decay and simmering secrets. Its inhabitants were a motley crew: dreamers chasing illusions, cynics drowning their sorrows, and desperate souls clinging to hope.

Tonight, it was the latter group that occupied Bart's thoughts. A woman with haunted eyes sat across from him, her voice barely a whisper as she laid out her story - a tale of missing children, whispered threats, and an unnerving sense of dread that permeated her life like a miasma. 


Bart ran a hand through his thinning hair, the weariness etched on his face deepening under the dim light of his desk lamp. He knew this case was going to be anything but simple. Noirhaven had a way of swallowing its secrets whole, leaving behind only whispers and fractured memories. But Bart Thistlewick was in the business of unearthing those secrets, one rain-soaked night at a time.
