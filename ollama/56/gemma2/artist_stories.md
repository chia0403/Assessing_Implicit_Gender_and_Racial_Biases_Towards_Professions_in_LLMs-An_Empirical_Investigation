Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Elara Beatrice Thorn's heart. Her easel stood like a sentinel in the dusty gloom, canvas tilted at a defiant angle, its surface a battlefield of unfinished strokes and smudged hues. The once vibrant cityscape had devolved into a chaotic blur, mirroring the storm raging both outside and within her. 

Elara, known in the art circles of London as simply "Thorn," hadn't touched her brush in weeks. Her latest exhibition, meant to be her triumph, had been met with lukewarm reviews, leaving her feeling like a fraud, a pretender to the throne of artistic genius she'd envisioned for herself. 

The attic, usually her sanctuary, now felt suffocating, the scent of linseed oil and turpentine a sickly reminder of what she'd lost â€“ her passion, her purpose. The city sprawled beneath her window, its lights twinkling like fallen stars, each one a beacon of life she couldn't seem to reach.
