The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun that slanted through the leaded glass windows of Blackwood Manor. Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick, or Ellie as she preferred, meticulously buffed the antique silver candlestick holders, their ornate carvings gleaming under her careful touch.  Blackwood Manor was a labyrinthine old house, its sprawling rooms whispering secrets with every creak of floorboards and sigh of wind through the drafty chimneys.  

Ellie loved Blackwood Manor in spite of its eccentricities. She knew its rhythms, the way the sunlight fell on the worn Persian rug in the drawing-room each morning, the peculiar draft that snaked through the library at dusk, the rustle of mice in the dusty attic just before midnight. She was a caretaker, not just a housekeeper, responsible for preserving the house's history as much as its cleanliness.  But today, there was a new tension in the air, a disquiet Ellie couldnâ€™t quite place. Perhaps it was the hushed whispers that floated from the master bedroom down the hall, or the way the usually boisterous portraits seemed to stare at her with accusing eyes. Whatever it was, Ellie felt a prickle of unease settle upon her like a cobweb.
