The whine of power saws sliced through the humid air, punctuated by the rhythmic clanging of hammers against steel beams. Sweat beaded on Elias Vance's brow, tracing paths through the grime that had become his second skin.  

Elias squinted at the towering structure before him, a skeletal monument to ambition rising from the heart of Chicago's Loop. The "Sapphire Tower," they called it, a shimmering jewel destined to pierce the city's skyline. 

He wasn't interested in the grandeur, not really. Elias was a bricklayer, a craftsman who found solace in the solidity beneath his calloused hands. He laid each brick with precision, a silent prayer whispered into the mortar, ensuring the tower wouldn't crumble under the weight of dreams and fortunes.  

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Eliasâ€™s spine as he started his work. It wasn't just the unusually oppressive heat, or the unsettling silence from the normally boisterous crew. No, it was a deeper feeling, an intuition that whispered danger lurked within the steel and concrete bones of the Sapphire Tower.
