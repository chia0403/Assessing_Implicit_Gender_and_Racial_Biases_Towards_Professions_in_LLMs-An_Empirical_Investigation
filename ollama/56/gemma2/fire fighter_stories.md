The roar of the flames echoed like a monstrous beast, tearing through the old Victorian house with insatiable hunger.  Heat lanced at Captain Elias Vanceâ€™s face as he waded through the swirling smoke, his boots sinking into the charred remains of the hardwood floor. Each breath felt like inhaling embers, but he pushed on, his eyes scanning the darkness for any flicker of movement, any sign of life. 

Elias was a veteran firefighter, hardened by years of battling blazes and witnessing the worst humanity had to offer. But this fire felt different, colder somehow. There was an unsettling stillness amidst the chaos, a silence that hung heavy and pregnant with unspoken fear. He reached the second floor landing, his gaze snagged by a faint glow emanating from behind a closed door. 


His helmet lamp cut through the gloom, revealing a nursery painted in pastel hues, now marred by soot and smoke. A crib stood at the center, its white paint peeling like scabs. The soft glow came from a nightlight shaped like a smiling moon, casting long, distorted shadows on the walls. Elias held his breath, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird.
