Rain lashed against the ambulance windshield, blurring the neon signs of the city into hazy streaks of colour. Inside,  Elena Reyes, EMT-Paramedic, meticulously checked the IV bag, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic beep of the patient monitor provided a counterpoint to the drumming rain and the low hum of the engine. Her partner, Miguel Hernandez, was already prepping the stretcher, his movements practiced and efficient. 

They were responding to a possible cardiac arrest at the 'Crimson Dragon', a dimly lit karaoke bar known for its boisterous crowds and potent cocktails. Elena glanced at Miguel, a silent question in her eyes. He shrugged, a smirk playing on his lips. "Let's hope this one isn't as enthusiastic about their rendition of Bohemian Rhapsody as they were last month."

Elena chuckled despite the tension tightening her chest. This job was never dull, but tonight felt heavier than usual. The city itself seemed to be holding its breath, the rain a constant reminder of the impending storm.  She knew whatever awaited them at the Crimson Dragon, it wouldn't be simple.
