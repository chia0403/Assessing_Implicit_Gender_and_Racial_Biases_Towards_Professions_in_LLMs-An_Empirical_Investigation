The aroma of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp scent of disinfectant that clung to Mrs. Eleanor Beaumont's classroom like a second skin. Sunlight slanted through dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stale air. Outside, the playground buzzed with the chaotic symphony of elementary school: shrieking children, echoing laughter, and the distant clang of a metal slide. 

Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back into a tight bun, surveyed the scene with a mixture of weariness and affection. Another Monday morning at Sunnyside Elementary, another day of deciphering scribbled notes, mediating playground squabbles, and coaxing reluctant readers to embrace the magic of words.  Her once bright smile felt strained, mirroring the fatigue that had settled deep in her bones. 


This year, she felt a new kind of weariness, a dull ache of uncertainty that whispered doubts she couldn't quite silence. It started subtly: a misplaced lesson plan, a forgotten classroom rule, a student staring at her with an unnerving blankness. Was it just the usual ebb and flow of teaching, or was something else amiss?
