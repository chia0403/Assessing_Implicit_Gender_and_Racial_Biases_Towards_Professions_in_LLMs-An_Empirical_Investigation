The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom, casting long shadows across the cluttered desks and half-finished student projects. Outside, the wind whipped around the aging brick building of Willow Creek High, rattling the windows like nervous whispers. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of stale chalk dust and forgotten dreams.  

Eleanor, her blonde hair pulled back in a tight bun that strained against the weight of the day's anxieties, stared out at the empty rows of chairs. Her students had vanished for the day, leaving behind a silence as profound as it was unsettling. Normally, Eleanor relished these quiet moments, using them to catch up on grading or plan her next lesson. Today, however, the stillness pressed in on her like a suffocating blanket, mirroring the emptiness she felt within.


The bell wouldn't ring again for another four hours, but Eleanor already knew she couldn't bear to sit idle until then.  She needed to move, to do something, anything, to break the oppressive quiet.
