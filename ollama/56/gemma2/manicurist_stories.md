The air in "Nails by Nadia" always smelled faintly of lavender and acetone. A thin mist clung to the polished chrome counters where bottles lined up like soldiers, each label promising a different shade of fantasy. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating a swirling rainbow of pigments on the wall behind Nadia’s station. It was a Wednesday morning, quiet as ever, punctuated only by the gentle whirring of the nail drill and the rhythmic tapping of Nadia’s foot against the floor. Her name, full and proper, was Nadezhda Petrovna Kozlova, but everyone called her Nadia.  She ran a practiced hand over her own nails, a deep crimson that matched the lipstick she wore with such confidence. The day stretched before her, empty and promising, like a fresh canvas waiting for its masterpiece. 


Nadia glanced at the clock: 9:02 AM. Today, maybe, would be different. Maybe today, someone would walk in with a story etched on their face, someone who needed more than just a manicure – they needed Nadia.
