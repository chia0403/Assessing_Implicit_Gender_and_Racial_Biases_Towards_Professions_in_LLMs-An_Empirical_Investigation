The sun hammered down on Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's neck as she squinted at the horizon. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mimicking the swirling anxieties in her stomach. Her boots kicked up plumes of red dirt with each step as she surveyed the decimated pasture.  

The drought had been relentless this year, sucking the life from the land like a thirsty beast. The normally lush green expanse had withered into a skeletal landscape, dotted with forlorn clumps of brittle grass and the bleached bones of long-dead cattle. The air hung heavy with the smell of sunbaked soil and desperation. 

Amy ran Blackwood Ranch, a legacy passed down through generations of her family.  It wasn't just land; it was history etched into every furrow of the earth, whispered in the rustle of wind through the aging mesquite trees, and sung by the mournful cry of hawks circling overhead. She couldn't let this drought steal it from her. 


This story takes place on Blackwood Ranch, a sprawling cattle ranch nestled in the heart of the Texas Panhandle. The year is 1935, and the land is ravaged by an unforgiving drought, pushing Amy to the brink.
