The salt-laced wind whipped through Amelia "Ace" Davenport's hair as she sat perched atop the landing gear of her vintage C-46 Skymaster, its wings catching the fading light of the Arizona sunset. The air shimmered over the vast expanse of the Salt River Delta below, a canvas painted with streaks of crimson and gold.  It was the kind of scene that could inspire awe in anyone but right now, all Ace felt was an unsettling dread, a premonition that hung heavy like the weight of her own pilot's suit.

The radio crackled to life, a gravelly voice filled with urgency, "Ace, we need you." It was Captain Davis, head of operations for Skyway Transport Lines, known in these parts as a lifeline between bustling cities and forgotten corners. 

"Where'd you get a new line, Cap?" Ace muttered under her breath, trying to suppress the feeling that something was deeply amiss. The Delta was their usual stomping ground, but this time, it felt different â€“ like an old wound begging to reopen.
