The humid air hung thick as a shroud over Harmony Creek, mirroring the weight that pressed down on Amelia Thorne's shoulders.  Her scrubs felt like iron sheets against her skin, each movement a physical manifestation of the unease gnawing at her insides.

Amelia adjusted her name tag - "Amy Thorne RN" - feeling a familiar surge of anxiety. The hospital loomed behind her like a gothic cathedral, its weathered facade a stark contrast to the vibrant life humming through its corridors.  She had come here with dreams, aspirations of proving herself worthy in this elite setting. But right now, all she could see were flashing red lights and an unnerving silence as if waiting for something to happen, a storm about to break over the placid shore of Harmony Creek.
