The fluorescent hum of the office lights buzzed like an irritated hornet in Evelyn Hayes' ears. The scent of stale coffee and over-processed TPS reports clung to everything like a forgotten bad dream. It was February 1st, peak season for her small tax prep business, "Taxes & Troubles" - though she suspected that name had been chosen more for the ironic juxtaposition than any actual comfort it afforded. Evelyn's worn leather desk chair creaked as she surveyed the chaos before her. A mountain of forms and receipts towered over a chaotic coffee stained mug – the sole survivor of a morning ritual gone awry. 

She sighed, running a hand through her perpetually windswept hair. Her phone buzzed with another frantic message from Mrs. Henderson, a new client whose income was more complicated than a tax code for a mid-century spaceship. Evelyn knew this would be one of the many battles she'd wage – battling IRS audits, navigating confusing loopholes and ensuring everyone paid their fair share. Yet, Evelyn couldn't help but feel a strange sense of satisfaction in it all.  She was good at her job - not because she was brilliant (she wasn't), but because she could navigate the tax code like a seasoned captain charting the uncharted waters of wealth and financial freedom – just for her clients.
