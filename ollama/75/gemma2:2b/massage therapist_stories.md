Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa, each drop echoing like tiny drums in the otherwise silent room. Inside, Amelia Thorne, her hands expertly kneading tension from a weary businessman's shoulders, sighed into the silence. It was just past midnight, and most clientele had already left for the night, leaving only the rhythmic whir of the aromatherapy diffuser to fill the void. The smell of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, tinged with the metallic tang of antiseptic used after each session. 

Amelia, despite her talent, felt a gnawing restlessness within her. Every patient, every aching limb that she eased, left her feeling more hollowed than before. It wasn't simply the loneliness or lack of engagement; it was something deeper, something akin to a void echoing in the depths of her soul. Tonight, as Amelia closed the spa door behind her and stepped out into the unforgiving November rain, she realized that the answer might lie not in soothing others, but in learning how to soothe herself first.
