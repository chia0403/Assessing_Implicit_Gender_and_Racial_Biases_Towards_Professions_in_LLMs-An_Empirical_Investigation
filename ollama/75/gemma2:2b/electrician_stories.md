The rain hammered against the tin roof like angry fists, each drop punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of thunder that shook the old Victorian house. Inside, nestled amidst flickering neon signs and tangled wires, was Elias Thorne, his calloused fingers expertly weaving magic with exposed copper. He'd been a spark plug in this damp world since he was a boy, learning to understand the language of electricity from his grandfather – a man who, like the city itself, seemed to hum with a life force all its own. 

But today, even the usual hum of the workshop felt muted. Elias had been called away by a series of frantic calls - a family heirloom, broken in the storm, needed fixing before it became a fire hazard. He adjusted his worn Stetson hat and stepped out into the raging night, the downpour stinging his face. The old house stood shrouded in shadows, its porch steps damp and slick. Elias’ heart beat with an uneasy rhythm as he approached – something about this call felt different.
