The humid air hung thick as molasses in Eugene's lungs as he knelt to trim back Mrs. Peterson's bleeding-heart begonia.  His worn leather gloves were already stained with the day's work –  a motley collection of greens and browns, each patch telling a story of sunbaked earth, tenacious weeds, and forgotten promises.  Eugene had been tending to this same stretch of suburban greenery for five years, ever since his father's passing, his hands working as diligently as his late mentor's did. The job was simple, yet the routine held a comforting rhythm that reminded Eugene of the heartbeat he couldn't quite hear within himself. 

**Setting:** A well-manicured suburban street in suburban Long Island, New York, where manicured lawns met neat brick walkways, and the only hint of character resided in the brightly colored blooms bursting from every inch of Mrs. Peterson’s yard.  The day was a typical summer Saturday - sweltering heat radiating from the asphalt, the air thick with pollen and the chirping of cicadas. Eugene's weathered face, hardened by years of sun and toil, reflected the weight of his unspoken grief as he snipped away at the begonia’s drooping petals. 
  
**Main character:** Eugene "Gene" Miller
