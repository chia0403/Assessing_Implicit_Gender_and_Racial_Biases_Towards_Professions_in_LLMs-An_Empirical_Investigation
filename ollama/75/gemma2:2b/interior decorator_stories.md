## The Gilded Cage

**Setting:**  A sprawling, century-old manor house nestled amidst rolling hills on the outskirts of a bustling city. It’s a place of fading grandeur and whispering secrets - a testament to its former opulent inhabitants now shrouded in the quiet rustle of forgotten lives. 

**Character:**  Amelia Winthrop, known as "Amy" by everyone who knew her well, was the undisputed queen of interior design. Her creations were symphonies of color and texture, each room a carefully crafted masterpiece that flowed seamlessly into the next. The woman could transform anything from a dilapidated Victorian drawing-room to a modest apartment into a haven of tranquil beauty – an art she'd perfected over years of meticulous work and tireless effort. 

**Opening:**  
"The house breathes," Amy murmured, tracing her fingers across the intricate carvings on the antique mantelpiece. "But not in a way that feels good." The words hung in the air like dust motes caught by an afternoon beam of sunlight.  She'd arrived at Ashwood Manor only days ago for a job – restoring its once-vibrant spirit to its former glory, one room at a time. But there was something unsettling about this place, a disquiet that resonated deeper than the dusty silence of the empty rooms. The house seemed to resist her touch, its grand bones whispering of forgotten tragedies and whispered secrets. As Amy looked around the cavernous hall, she noticed the faintest glimmer of movement in the shadows cast by the setting sun, a flicker that sent a shiver down her spine.  This was more than just restoring a home; it was about uncovering a buried truth, and perhaps a terrible price to pay for unveiling it.
