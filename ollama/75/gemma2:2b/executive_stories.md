## The City That Never Sleeps... But Didn't Today

**Setting:**  Neo-Tokyo, 2077 - A sprawling metropolis that pulses with neon light and futuristic technology, yet struggles beneath the sheen of progress. Crumbling skyscrapers pierce the sky, testaments to a past too hasty, while holographic advertisements flicker above rain-slicked avenues. The air is thick with humidity, punctuated by the rumble of automated delivery drones and the distant hum of flying cars.

**Character:** Alistair "Alli" Finch - CEO of FinTech Corp., a giant in the financial world whose wealth rivals some nations' governments.  At 42, he wears tailored suits meticulously pressed to perfection, but his eyes betray the weight of countless sleepless nights, haunted by whispers of hidden threats and whispered deals made under the city’s perpetually burning sun.

**Opening:** The penthouse suite was a symphony of controlled chaos: a mirrored wall reflecting the neon-drenched cityscape, an art installation with flickering holographic flowers blooming in the air, and a custom-made espresso machine humming away in the corner. But Alli couldn't bring himself to enjoy it. The city felt like a cage tonight.  He ran his hands over his meticulously groomed face, the anxiety he always carried now throbbing through him like a phantom limb. 

“Alli,” his assistant’s voice was a calm anchor amidst the storm brewing inside him, “The stock value is down. Someone's going for our core algorithm.” 
 
He stood, his eyes scanning the skyline through the floor-to-ceiling windows, searching for something, but finding only a reflection of his own turmoil. "It’s not just the algorithm, Amelia," he sighed, his voice rough with exhaustion. "There's something else at play here."

The question was no longer how to save FinTech Corp., it was why someone would target them so directly, and what price they were willing to pay. The city that never slept now felt like a tomb, holding secrets far deeper than the gleaming facade.  And Alli knew he had to find those secrets before his empire crumbled beneath them.
