The air in Florence hung thick with the scent of jasmine and old stone, a symphony of smells that both comforted and frustrated Althea Thorne-Delacroix. She stood before her easel, sunlight filtering through the open window, turning dust motes into shimmering jewels on the canvas stretched out before her. The Uffizi was bustling with tourists, their cameras clicking like an irritated swarm of bees as they tried to capture a fleeting moment in time. But for Althea, the crowd held no allure. Their focus was on capturing the image; theirs the sterile perfection that the world demanded. Her brush sang a different song, her art born of the messy, unfiltered soul.

Althea was lost in the dance between brush and canvas, her mind conjuring images she couldn't quite grasp yet, the feeling like a silent film playing on repeat in her soul.  She painted with reckless abandon, letting colors spill across the canvas, each stroke fueled by an unquenchable desire to express the chaos within. The world outside seemed to fade into insignificance as Althea’s focus narrowed; it was just her and the canvas, her brush a conductor leading her heart’s orchestra of emotions onto the blank space before her. 


**Setting:** Althea's studio is a haven of vibrant color in a traditionally quiet corner of Florence. The walls are lined with canvases overflowing with both unfinished masterpieces and studies; the air smells of turpentine and linseed oil, a familiar warmth.  Her life was an art itself: unfiltered, passionate, and raw.
