The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of diesel fumes and stale coffee as Lester "Dusty" Callahan pulled his semi-truck into the cracked asphalt parking lot at The Iron Bull Saloon. The sun had bled behind the mountain peaks, casting long shadows across the dusty landscape.  As he shut down the engine, a lone crow cawed mournfully from a nearby power line, its black feathers glinting like obsidian under the dying light. 

The Iron Bull was a dive bar with an air of forgotten grit, nestled in a town where time seemed to have stopped running faster than a truck tire on gravel. Dusty had been stopping here every Thursday for the last twenty years, his route taking him past countless deserted towns and lonely highways. This wasnâ€™t a place that he frequented for the company, or even the beer; it was a reminder of the vastness and silence that surrounded him in life.  The saloon was an oasis amidst that loneliness, its flickering neon sign the only light in this forgotten corner of America.
