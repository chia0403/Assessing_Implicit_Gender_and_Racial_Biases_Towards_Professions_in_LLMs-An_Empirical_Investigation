The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in an incessant, mocking rhythm. Amelia "Amy" Pierce, her white coat clinging to her like a second skin, surveyed the small waiting room with weary eyes.  Her stethoscope rested carelessly against her hip, its hollow thud echoing through the sterile silence that permeated the clinic. It had been another long day. The line of anxious patients waiting for their bloodwork results was growing steadily longer, and Amy felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach. A sense of unease always lingered when the needle pierced the skin, each poke an invasive reminder of the fragility of life.

Amy wasn't just any phlebotomist; she worked at The Nightingale Clinic, a haven for those seeking medical answers amidst the anxieties of modern life. It was in this very room that the whispers circulated - stories of breakthroughs, diagnoses confirmed, and lives altered forever by the thin stream of blood analyzed. Yet today, Amy felt detached. Even as she expertly drew blood from each patient, her mind wandered to a new case file sitting on her desk â€“ one shrouded in an unsettling silence. The patient was just another anonymous face, but something about his name, "Victor Thorne," resonated with Amy like a forgotten chord playing in the back of her brain.
