## The Scent of Salt & Secrets

The salty air whipped Elara's hair across her face as she stood before the towering waves crashing against the pebbled beach.  Each morning, this was her ritual.  A quick snip at her reflection in the sea glass window of her beachside salon, "Sea Glass Salon," and then the endless task of prepping for a new day's symphony of scents - the familiar tang of salt mixed with sunshine-kissed coconut shampoo, the heady aroma of lavender and citrus that always seemed to beckon customers like moths to a flame.

But today was different. A storm churned beneath the surface of her carefully crafted morning calm, an unsettling feeling she couldn't quite place. The usually bright hues of the beach towels lining her salon walls were muted; even the cheerful waves lapping against the shore seemed to sigh with an underlying sadness. Elaraâ€™s brow furrowed as she adjusted a strand of turquoise hair ribbon, her usual cheerfulness tinged with a hint of unease. 

She took a deep breath, pulling in the lingering scent of the sea and the faintest hint of something else - a mix of pine needles, damp earth, and the faintest whiff of fear. It felt like a hidden message beneath the crashing waves, waiting for her to decipher it.  Elara's heart pounded against her ribs. This was more than just a beach day; something wasn't right.
