## The Quiet Room

**Setting:**  A small, sparsely decorated office tucked away in the corner of Willow Creek High's bustling building. Sunlight streams through a single window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its rays. A worn armchair sits beside an oversized desk piled with books and folders, while the air hums with a faint static from a broken clock on the wall. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne is a woman of quiet demeanor. Her auburn hair is neatly pulled back into a bun, revealing a sharp, yet kind face framed by glasses.  Years have etched their wisdom onto her features - lines at the corners of her eyes tell stories of countless students' lives she has touched. At Willow Creek High, Amy has cultivated an almost legendary reputation for understanding the unspoken struggles that cloud teenage minds.

 **Opening:** 
Amy ran a hand through her hair, already feeling the familiar knot of unease in her stomach. It was almost time. She glanced at the clock - 3:07 PM. The late afternoon sun slanted through the window, casting long shadows across the room, making the usual calm unsettlingly quiet. Her breath hitched as the small metal door opened and a boy stepped inside. He was younger than most of her clients - his features still held the innocence of youth, but there was an undeniable weight in his eyes that made Amy's heart sink. The boy, barely fifteen, stood frozen before her, clutching a crumpled paper bag in trembling hands.

“It’s… it's him,” he whispered, his voice barely audible over the hum of the ceiling fan. 

Amy took a deep breath, knowing this was just the start of another chapter she had no choice but to decipher.
