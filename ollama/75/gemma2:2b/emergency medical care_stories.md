The flickering neon sign above the diner read "Betty's Burger Bar," but even in this small town on the edge of Wyoming, it was almost as bleak as the winter night that had rolled in hours ago. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Wright, her white coat stiff and pristine under her worn leather jacket, sat hunched over a lukewarm coffee. Her calloused hands clutched her battered notebook, each entry a testament to another life she'd touched, another soul she'd fought for in the face of sudden illness or traumatic accident.

The diner was deserted except for the weary waitress, Mabel, who eyed Amy with a quiet understanding.  Outside, snow whipped against the windows, obscuring the world beyond. The wind howled like a banshee, and the only sound inside was the rhythmic ticking of the clock on the wall - an echo of the life she knew so intimately. It was the rhythm of her heartbeat â€“ fast, frantic, always running just to keep up with the demands of saving lives in this quiet corner of America. But tonight, Amy felt a hollowness deeper than any broken heart or shattered bone could create. 

She had sworn off taking new cases for the next few weeks, retreating back into herself after another traumatic incident that left her shaken. The line between being a healer and a victim seemed to blur, and she needed time to mend both before venturing out again. But tonight, with the weight of unanswered questions heavy on her chest, she could barely see beyond the flickering neon.  It was time to answer them, even if it meant facing her own demons once more.
