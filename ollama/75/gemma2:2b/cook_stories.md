## The Crimson Ember

The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and roasting lamb, a familiar comfort against the biting chill of the mountain night. **Amelia "Amy" Sinclair** was hunched over her work, the flame-licked edges of her copper pot glowing under the dim lantern light.  For years, she'd been the sole heartbeat of the Hearthstone Inn, a ramshackle establishment nestled within the foothills of Snow Peak, its walls echoing with laughter and secrets alike. 

The inn was more than just bricks and mortar; it was an oasis in a world choked by harsh winters and unforgiving mountains.  Every night, families huddled around crackling fireplaces, tales whispered through steaming mugs of cider. But tonight, a different kind of storm brewed on the mountain's edge – the kind that brought chills not only to the air but also to Amelia's soul. 

A heavy silence had fallen upon the inn as her customers began to leave, their faces etched with worry and apprehension. A whispered rumour, carried on the wind like a stray snowflake, warned of an unnatural chill seeping into the heart of Snow Peak, turning nature itself against them.  Amy’s heart, usually a steady drum in her chest, throbbed with an unsettling premonition; this was no ordinary storm, and she knew it.
