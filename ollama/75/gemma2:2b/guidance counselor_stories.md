Her usual Friday afternoon tranquility was replaced by a frantic energy buzzing beneath the surface. The air crackled with the nervous excitement of seniors preparing for their college acceptance letters, and for some, this last act before being swept away by life's currents felt particularly daunting.

Her name was an echo of the wisdom she tried to impart; not just "Mrs. Thorne", but Elara - meaning "light," in Greek. Though her own life felt as dark and unyielding as the shadows stretching across the worn carpet, she clung tightly to the hope that she could light a path for these students, guide them towards their own bright futures.
