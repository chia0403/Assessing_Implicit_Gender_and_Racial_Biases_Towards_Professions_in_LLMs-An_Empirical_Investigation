Rain lashed against the boarded windows, the sound almost drowning out the rhythmic thudding of Thomas “Tommy” Blackwood’s hammer on wood. He stood hunched in his workshop, the air thick with sawdust and the scent of aging pine. The small shop, tucked away behind Mrs. Peabody's lavender emporium in the heart of Oakhaven, was a symphony of smells and sounds – not unlike a storm itself. Outside, the wind howled a mournful tune as the sky cracked open, unleashing a torrent of rain that soaked the cobblestones and turned them into treacherous slickness.  

Tommy felt a pang of unease despite years spent in this familiar chaos. The last storm had brought a strange, eerie silence to Oakhaven – no children's laughter from the playground down the street, no barking dogs echoing through the lanes, just an unsettling quiet that seeped into his bones. He glanced at his latest commission: a grand oak table for Mrs. Blackwood’s newest shop display. A project that usually brought him joy, now felt as heavy and ominous as the storm brewing outside.
