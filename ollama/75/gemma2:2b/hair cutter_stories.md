The air hung thick with the scent of rosemary and lavender as **Cassia Thistlewick** ran her fingers through a client's auburn waves, her nimble hands coaxing out the perfect curl in each section. It was a warm summer evening at "The Cutting Room," her small, charming salon nestled between a vintage bookshop and a struggling Italian bakery in a quiet corner of London's historic Greenwich district.  Outside, the Thames meandered lazily, casting a dusky glow on the bustling crowds. But inside, the room pulsed with a unique energy - an intimate symphony of whispers, rustling fabric, and the soft clinking of shears. 

Cassia loved her work; it was her sanctuary, a place where the burdens of the outside world melted away. However, tonight felt different. A sense of unease coiled in her stomach as she glanced over at the clock: it was past closing time. An unexpected silence hung heavy, broken only by the rhythmic hum of the hair dryer and the faint creak of the wooden floorboards.  This stillness seemed oddly unsettling, like a silent storm brewing on the horizon.
