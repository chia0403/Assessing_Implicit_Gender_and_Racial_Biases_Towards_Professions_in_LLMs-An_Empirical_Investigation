Rain lashed against the windows of Sunnydale Kindergarten, blurring the cheerful, hand-painted mural depicting sunbeams dancing with butterflies. Inside, Ms. Eleanor Hawthorne meticulously sorted out playdough creations into neat piles – each one meticulously labelled "Dinosaur", "Firetruck", and "Oceanic".  Her smile, though a little weary from yet another chaotic morning of sticky fingerprints and singalongs about the alphabet, was still warm. She'd traded in her high heels for comfortable sneakers this afternoon, ready to embark on another adventure with her charges.

The rain outside was relentless, mirroring the tumultuous emotions bubbling within Ms. Hawthorne’s heart. Today was Friday, meaning it was Mrs. Perkins’ last day as a kindergarten teacher before retiring to her beloved seaside cottage. The news had come as a shock, leaving Ms. Hawthorne feeling both terrified and oddly excited for a new chapter in her life. Her quiet routine of preparing lessons and interacting with little humans was about to be upended, but she couldn't shake off the lingering pang of sadness for Mrs. Perkins' absence – the comforting hand on her shoulder during meltdowns, the gentle encouragement whispered before bedtime stories, the unwavering faith in Ms. Hawthorne’s ability to nurture young minds.
