Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Croft's office, each drop like a tiny hammer on the pane. Outside, Portland was drowning in grey. Inside, however, the air hung thick with chamomile and something else, something distinctly human - the weight of secrets and whispered anxieties.  Amelia sighed, her weathered hands tracing the inscription on her desk: "You are not alone." 

As usual, she'd be left with more questions than answers after this session. Her office was a sanctuary for those who felt lost in the storm of their own lives, but even in the calmest storms, there were tides that crashed against Amelia’s shore.  She’d just seen something from one of her patients that made her question everything she thought she knew about humanity – and it wasn't anything so much as a symptom or an indicator of trauma. It was far more insidious, far deeper. 
 


**Setting:** A private counseling practice in Portland, Oregon. The atmosphere is warm but cluttered with books on various psychological theories and personal journals.  Outside, the rainstorm continues.

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia Croft (a seasoned and insightful counseling psychologist). She has a quiet demeanor, a calm voice, and an unwavering belief in the human spirit's resilience.


**What could happen next?** 
* Is something off about this patient's admission of "feeling like they're drowning"?  Amelia's mind races with questions about what she might be overlooking.
* What is the inscription on her desk meant to symbolize?
* Are there hidden messages or symbols in the room itself, perhaps hinting at a larger narrative?
