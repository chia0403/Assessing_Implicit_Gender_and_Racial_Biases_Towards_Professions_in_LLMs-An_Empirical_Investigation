The greasy smell hung thick in the air, clinging to Amelia's worn overalls like an old friend.  She wiped her hands on her stained apron, the grime mirroring the dust motes dancing in the late afternoon sun filtering through the garage doors of "Mama Rose's Garage."  It was a name that held both history and humor - Mama Rose, Amelia's grandmother, had started this place over fifty years ago with a worn-out jack, an even more worn-out attitude, and an endless supply of grease. 

Amelia wasn't sure where she got her grit from, her grandfather, the other half of "Mama Rose" in their partnership, had been a whirlwind of mechanics and muscle. But Amelia had inherited his love for the hum of engines and the satisfaction of a perfect repair.  Today though, even her usual joy was dimmed by a gnawing worry. The last call from Mr. Henderson - the old man who lived at the edge of town and whose antique tractor refused to start - felt heavier than usual. Not just because the engine coughed with the same weariness as the farmer's spirit but because it reminded Amelia that the time for "going slow" was rapidly approaching. 
 
Amelia tightened her grip on the wrench, the metal cool against her sweating palm.  It was just a simple repair; she knew it. Just needed to figure out why Mr. Hendersonâ€™s tractor wouldn't fire up. But something about the urgency in his voice, the way he'd practically begged for help, left a knot of anxiety in her stomach.
