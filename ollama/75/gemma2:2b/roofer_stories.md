##  The Old Man's Last Wish

The wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the oak that cast its shadow over Michael's work site. Rain, heavy with grit and smelling distinctly of ozone after a summer storm, lashed down on the worn asphalt shingles of Miller's house. A figure hunched against the chill as he surveyed the work ahead –  a dilapidated Victorian masterpiece with more secrets than shingles, just like the old man who owned it.

His name was Michael Thompson, a lifelong roofer with calloused hands and an easy smile that could charm even the grumpiest of neighbors. At forty-two, his hair had begun to recede, leaving him looking older than his years –  the map of hard work etched onto his face. His father had been a carpenter, the man who taught Michael the secrets of wood and metal before he'd shown him the trade of a roofer. 

This old house, however, held its own brand of mysteries, stories hidden beneath the layers of paint, peeling wallpaper, and weather-beaten wooden beams. It was on the cusp of being swallowed by time, yet whispered stories of families who lived there long ago, their joys and sorrows echoing in the creaky floorboards. 

This afternoon, Michael found himself facing a new chapter: Old Man Miller's last wish. The man had been a fixture in the neighborhood for over half a century, and his legacy was woven into the very fabric of their community. Now, at ninety-two, he lay on his deathbed, surrounded by memories he desperately wanted to share before he left this world. His final wish – to have his house roofed before he died.
