## The Neon Nightingale

**Opening:** Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the Starlight Lounge, mirroring the throb of anxiety beating in Celeste Blackwood's chest.  She stood backstage, dressed in her signature shimmering emerald gown - a stark contrast to the smoky haze and dim lighting of the stage. Tonight was the big night, her debut at the prestigious 'Echoes of Time' concert hall, an institution known for nurturing musical prodigy's into global superstars. 

**Setting:**  The Starlight Lounge, nestled in a forgotten corner of New Orleans. The bar is old, with peeling paint and mismatched furniture, its atmosphere clinging to the echoes of countless stories told over decades. Outside, the vibrant energy of the French Quarter pulsed, but within the lounge's dim walls, time seemed to have stopped - an illusion shattered by the melody that drifted from a vintage upright piano. 


**Character:** Celeste Blackwood. A young singer with a voice as smooth and supple as jazz music itself.  Her stage presence was electrifying â€“ she moved like liquid moonlight, her eyes burning with passion as each note danced off her tongue. She had honed her voice through years of tireless practice in the dusty back alleys and smoky dive bars of New Orleans. Now, she was ready to take on the world. 


**Possible plot hook:**  A rival singer arrives backstage, radiating an aura of arrogance and disdain for Celeste's down-to-earth charm. They engage in a verbal duel, threatening to sabotage Celeste's performance, setting the stage for a battle of talent, ambition, and raw emotion.
