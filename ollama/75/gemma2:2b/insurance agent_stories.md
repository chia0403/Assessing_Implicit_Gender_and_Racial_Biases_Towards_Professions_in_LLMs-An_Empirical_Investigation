Rain lashed against the glass windows of Amelia "Amy" Croft's office, blurring the cityscape outside into an impressionist landscape of grey and silver.  A thick plume of steam curled from the mug of lukewarm coffee in her hands as she stared at the last policy file on her desk – a hefty life insurance contract for the seemingly-unremarkable Mr. Henderson. Amy sighed, her eyes weary but not entirely defeated. 

She'd been an insurance agent for fifteen years now, and while she loved helping families navigate the intricacies of their policies, there was something about this case that felt different. The death of Mr. Henderson had been sudden – a freak accident, they'd said – but Amy couldn't shake off the feeling that there was more to the story. It wasn't just the grief in her clients’ eyes or the whispers and hushed conversations in the office.  It was something deeper, a disquiet that gnawed at the edges of her mind. 

The rain outside had turned into a torrential downpour, echoing the turmoil within Amy's own soul. The case felt like an unsolvable puzzle, one that wouldn’t fit together until she unearthed a truth hidden beneath layers of seemingly mundane policy details.  Amy knew the answer was somewhere in those files, but for now, all she had were fleeting thoughts and unanswered questions: "What if it wasn't just accident?"
