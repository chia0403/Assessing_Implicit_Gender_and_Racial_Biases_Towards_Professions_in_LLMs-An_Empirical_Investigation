## The Grand Phoenix Hotel

**Opening:**  The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and despair as **Edwin "Eddy" Hawthorne** checked in his latest guest for the night. He smoothed back his neatly-styled black hair that refused to stay put under the unforgiving heat, then sighed dramatically. A man’s gotta do what a man’s gotta do, he thought wryly, adjusting his crisp white uniform collar. The Grand Phoenix Hotel was beautiful – an impossible extravagance of opulence with its soaring ceilings and shimmering chandeliers – but the beauty held a melancholic weight, like a ghost from a forgotten era. 

**Setting:** 1920s New Orleans. 
The city still hummed with the rhythm of jazz, but under the surface, whispers of trouble echoed through smoky alleys and shady casinos. 

Eddy knew the city’s soul as intimately as he knew the feel of his worn-out shoes against the polished marble floors. He was an enigma – a man of quiet charm and hidden depths, who used to polish shoes by day before becoming the bell hop of the grandest hotel in town. Now, with each guest check-in and subsequent farewell, Eddy's world was expanding into something he couldn’t quite define.
