## The Magnolia Manor 

**Setting:**  Charleston, South Carolina - summer 2023. Rain pattered gently on the weathered shingles of old Victorian houses lining the cobbled streets. The humidity clung thick in the air, each breath carrying a hint of salt and floral sweetness from the nearby gardens blooming at the edge of Magnolia Manor, a grand estate now for sale.

**Main Character:**  Evelyn "Ev" Hawthorne -  a spirited, quick-witted realtor whose passion for real estate had been inherited from her grandmother, a prominent historical preservationist in Charleston. 

**Opening:**

The aroma of jasmine and old paper mingled as Ev stepped onto the porch of Magnolia Manor. Her eyes, the color of warm caramel, scanned the sprawling house - its intricate carvings, its peeling paint, and the faded grandeur it held within.  Sheâ€™d been called to tend to the estate's sale. A delicate task for a woman who dreamt of bringing forgotten places back to life. 

Evelyn sighed. The property was a ghost of her grandmother's tales, echoing with lost laughter and whispered secrets. The whispers started as soon as she opened the door, a faint rustling like wind through dried leaves.  "Ev," came the voice from behind her, quiet and measured, "We're expecting you." A tall man emerged from the shadows, his face framed by a dusting of silver hair. It was Mr. James Hawthorne, Evelyn's grandmother's trusted friend and estate manager.

Ev turned to him. "Mr. Hawthorne?  I was just... admiring the place." She gestured at the peeling paint and faded balconies, unable to suppress a smile. 

"Not just admiring, Ev," he said with a twinkle in his eye. "There's something else we need you to see."
