The biting wind whipped through Elias Thorne's thick beard as he adjusted his worn Stetson, squinting against the grey dawn. The air was heavy with the smell of pine needles and damp earth, a constant reminder of the life that thrummed through every inch of the ancient forest surrounding him.  He stood on the edge of Blackwood Ridge, his worn boots sinking into the muddy earth. 
The sun, a pale sliver behind the cloud-laden sky, struggled to break through, casting long shadows across the vast expanse of towering pines and thick undergrowth. Eliasâ€™s weathered hand tightened around the handle of his trusty axe, the iron cool against his calloused palm.  Today was the day. He'd been planning it for months, every moment spent dreaming of this single swing. 

**Here are some elements to build on:**

* **What is Elias's goal?** Is he seeking a new life away from the forest? Or is there something more personal driving his determination?
* **Who or what threatens him in this setting?**  Is it the harsh environment, his own past demons, or perhaps another character altogether? 
* **Where is Blackwood Ridge?** Is it rural, isolated, close to a city? How does its location impact Elias's life and choices?
