Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's clinic, each drop exploding into a miniature geyser on the already grimy glass. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping through the ancient oaks that lined the street and sending shivers down even the most stoic patient. Inside, however, the air was thick with the scent of pine essential oil and an almost tangible sense of calm. 

Evelyn herself seemed to have embraced the storm outside, her auburn hair drawn back in a tight bun, highlighting her determined eyes framed by the lines etched by years spent both treating and battling her own chronic pain. It was ironic, Evelyn mused, that she'd dedicated her life to helping others recover from their physical ailments – yet she found herself battling a relentless enemy of her own: arthritis, creeping through her bones with each passing year. 

Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, the storm was not an obstacle but a challenge. A man in his late forties, named Arthur Lawson, sat on the edge of his chair, visibly anxious and clutching a thick folder that seemed to hold more than just legal documents. His eyes, normally bright with a mischievous glint, were clouded with fear.  Evelyn could feel it - a knot forming in her own stomach, mirroring the one within Arthur's chest. This wasn't just another patient, this was something… else entirely.
