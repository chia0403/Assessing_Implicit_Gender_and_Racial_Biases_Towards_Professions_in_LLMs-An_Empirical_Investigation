The roar of the engines filled Amelia "Amy" Sterling's ears as she strapped on her headset, a familiar sound that brought a comforting weight to her chest despite the turbulence swirling around the plane. The sun dipped beneath the horizon, painting the sky in shades of bruised plum and fiery orange as she glanced at the row of empty seats.  Her station: cabin 32A - where she'd spent countless nights serving coffee to weary travelers before the world felt too close for words and too far for comfort.  

Amy sighed, a quiet sound swallowed by the hum of the engines and the gentle rustle of passengers settling into their seats. The aroma of lavender air freshener in the galley mingled with the faint scent of stale chocolate from a forgotten box. Tonight's journey was particularly fraught, carrying a crew of stressed-out medical interns, a family escaping a hurricane in Florida, and a lone, stoic businessman heading back to his cold, empty life in Chicago. 

This flight wasn’t just about miles and destinations; it was about the faces etched with exhaustion, the unspoken stories behind those weary eyes, the hushed conversations whispered between the rows. Tonight, Amy would become more than just a flight attendant.  Tonight, she’d be the silent bridge between worlds, the quiet comfort in the storm.
