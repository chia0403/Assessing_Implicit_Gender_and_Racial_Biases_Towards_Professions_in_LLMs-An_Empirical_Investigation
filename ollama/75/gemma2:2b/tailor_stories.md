The sun beat down on the cobblestones of Little London, turning the air thick with dust and the scent of overripe plums from Mrs. Peabody's shop next door.  Inside the bustling workshop of Silas Thorne, the sounds of his needle stitching against silk mingled with the rhythmic whirring of the sewing machine. For twenty years, Silas had been weaving through fabric and thread like a phantom in the city's fabric. His nimble fingers knew every curve and fold, every secret knot and seam of the countless garments he'd created for the discerning citizens of Little London. 

Silas, with his thinning hair swept back from a face weathered by years spent under the sun and surrounded by needles, felt the familiar thrill as he began work on a commission: a gown for Lady Elara Blackwood, renowned beauty and mistress of the prestigious Blackwood Academy for Young Ladies. The silk was a deep, almost unreal indigo, shimmering with an inner luminescence that promised to capture the moonlight on its surface, but Silas saw more than just fashion in this commission. He'd heard whispers about a strange illness plaguing the academy's grounds â€“ a creeping cold that had no known cure.  He felt a familiar pull towards the unspoken mystery of it all, the way his needle always seemed to find the thread of something bigger, even as he painstakingly sewed intricate designs for Lady Blackwood.
