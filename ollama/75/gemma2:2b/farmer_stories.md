The wind whipped at Elara's calloused hands as she steered her old mule, Buttercup, through the muddy field. The rain had finally eased to a gentle drizzle, leaving behind a trail of glistening mud and damp earth.  Sunlight struggled to pierce the thick canopy of evergreen trees that formed an impenetrable curtain around their small homestead nestled in the valley's heart. Even through the chill autumn air, the smell of woodsmoke from the hearth hung heavy, a promise of warmth and comfort against the approaching winter. 

Elara, known throughout the community as "Ma Elara" for her weathered face and gentle nature, ran her rough hands over the furrows carved into the field with years of hard work. It was this land that she'd inherited from her grandfather, a legacy etched onto every blade of grass, every fallen leaf, and every twisted root beneath her feet. Yet, tonight, she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease. There were things happening in the valley â€“ whispers of strange occurrences, rustling leaves at night, and the ever-present shadow of an unknown threat that felt more like a tangible thing than a mere rumour.
