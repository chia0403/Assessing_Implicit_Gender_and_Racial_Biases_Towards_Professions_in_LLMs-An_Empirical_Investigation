The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Grant’s thick auburn hair around her face as she hurried down the beach road, its familiar grey sand turning to the gritty expanse of storm-tossed waves. The morning fog clung low over the horizon, swallowing the sun like a hungry beast. A symphony of crashing waves and squawking gulls filled the air. 

Amelia was no stranger to the unpredictable moods of the ocean. For years she'd walked these beaches with her father, his weathered hands guiding hers as they inspected injured seabirds, their fragile cries echoing in the vast expanse of water.  But today was different. Today, Amelia was on a mission - her beloved tabby cat, Jasper, whimpered from his cage beside the makeshift surgery table she'd set up at the clinic down by the old pier. 

He wasn't just any pet. Jasper was part of the family, a constant companion and confidante.  Yet, something felt off about him. His usually playful eyes held a disturbing stillness, and his normally spry gait was replaced with a slow limping walk that sent Amelia’s heart into her throat. The storm had brought more than just rough waves; it had carried its own silent terror – one that echoed in Jasper's whimpers and made Amelia's resolve harden like the unforgiving sand beneath her feet.
