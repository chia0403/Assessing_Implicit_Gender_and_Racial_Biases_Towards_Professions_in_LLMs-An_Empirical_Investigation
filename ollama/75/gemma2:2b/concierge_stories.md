The rain hammered against the arched doorway, each drop echoing like a tiny gunshot in the silent lobby.  Inside, Aurelia "Lill" Delacroix adjusted her crisp black beret, pushing back strands of silver hair that had escaped the confines of its clip. Her eyes, normally twinkling with the warmth of Parisian charm, were shadowed by the storm's fury. 

The Grand Hôtel des Fleurs was a monument to time and elegance, yet even in its gilded halls, Lill felt the chill of the night. The scent of old money mingled with damp plaster, a familiar aroma she’d carried since her early days working for Monsieur Dubois, the hotel owner whose eyes held as much wisdom as his silvered hair. He was gone now, and Lill now stood alone at the helm of this grand establishment that once pulsed with the lifeblood of Parisian society.  

Tonight, however, the lobby echoed with an unsettling silence, a stillness punctuated only by the rhythmic thump of rain against stone. The bellhop hadn’t made his usual entrance to fetch her the key for room 203, and Lill's gut twisted with unease. A storm like this one rarely brought good news; it always brought something unexpected. Something that threatened to unravel the carefully woven tapestry of the Grand Hôtel's existence.
