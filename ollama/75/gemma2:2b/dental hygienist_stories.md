The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Wright's head as she navigated the labyrinthine corridors of Dr. Lawson's office. The air hung thick with the smell of bleach and antiseptic - a scent that usually comforted her but tonight felt almost suffocating.  Tonight, she wasn't just cleaning teeth; tonight, there was something heavier in the air - something that clung to Amelia's throat like dust motes. 

Amelia adjusted her glasses and scanned the waiting room for any sign of Mrs. Henderson, the elderly woman who had been so insistent about seeing Dr. Lawson again. It was almost time for her shift to begin, which was unusual considering it was a Tuesday afternoon, but Mrs. Henderson's persistent need for an extra cleaning had thrown off the usual rhythm of their day-to-day routine. 

The setting: a bustling dental practice in the heart of Chicago, one that hummed with an eclectic mix of patients and staff - some regulars, others like Mrs. Henderson, who were navigating lifeâ€™s unexpected detours through the practiced hands of Dr. Lawson and his team. 


As she began to prepare for her first patient, a knot tightened in Amelia's stomach. She knew something was amiss, an unsettling feeling that mirrored the weightiness of her task. Tonight, it wasn't just about cleaning teeth; tonight, the unspoken anxieties swirling within the office were about to come to light.
