The crisp Chicago air carried an almost metallic tang that clung to Ethan "Three Aces" Caldwell like a second skin.  He perched precariously on his usual rooftop perch, overlooking the sprawling metropolis from atop the towering spire of the LaSalle Street Bank.  Ethan had been called "Lucky" as a boy, and he'd always known why.  Born amidst the whirlwind of Wall Street during the '80s, Three Aces was a born card shark in the high-stakes game of finance. He was notorious for his ruthless instincts, his ability to read the market like an open book, and his uncanny knack for pulling rabbits out of hats when it came to making deals.  Today's deal, however, seemed different. 

He swiveled the tiny cigarillo between his fingers, its cherry glowing in the afternoon sun. The air crackled with tension, a stark contrast to the usual languid swagger that defined Ethan Caldwell’s presence. His eyes, usually bright and playful behind thick-rimmed glasses, held an unnerving stillness as he scanned the intricate web of financial data projected on the screen in front of him. 
His gaze landed on a single word – "Blackout." It was a stark red line, pulsing with danger, like a warning siren screaming against the calm backdrop of his usual calculated precision. Tonight's game had gone off script, and Ethan felt every fiber of his being tenser than he had ever imagined.  This was no mere high-stakes trade; this was something…else. 
The clock on the wall ticked away in silent urgency. His gut churned with an unease he couldn’t shake off as the city lights below began to shift from a familiar symphony of color into a chaotic, blinding kaleidoscope of uncertainty.  This was more than just another day in the life of a stockbroker; it was a storm brewing at the edge of chaos.
