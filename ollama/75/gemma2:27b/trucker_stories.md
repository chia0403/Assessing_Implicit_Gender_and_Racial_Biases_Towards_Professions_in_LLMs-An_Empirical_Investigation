The diner's fluorescent lights buzzed like angry wasps, casting a sickly yellow glow over the chipped Formica tabletop. Elias "Eli" Blackwood chewed on a stale french fry, his gaze drifting past the greasy windowpane to the endless expanse of Nevada desert beyond. The wind, hot and dry as sandpaper, whipped sand against the glass, blurring the distant mountains into hazy silhouettes. Eli sighed, the sound lost in the rumble of the semi-trucks idling outside. He'd been on the road for three days straight, hauling a load of cattle feed from Kansas City to Reno. His cab was his sanctuary, a rolling steel cocoon filled with the comforting hum of the engine and the scent of diesel fuel. But even Eli, who considered himself a man of the open road, was starting to feel the gnawing loneliness that came with spending too much time alone. 

He glanced at his phone - no signal. Typical. He'd been hoping for a call from his daughter, Sarah, but knew it was unlikely with him constantly moving between states. It wasn't an ideal situation, raising a kid on the road, but Eli had promised himself he wouldn't miss out on her life. He just needed to make this last haul, then he'd be home for Sarah's 10th birthday. 

Suddenly, the diner door swung open, letting in a blast of scorching air and a tall figure cloaked in shadow. Eli watched as the newcomer approached the counter, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat.  Something about them felt...off. But before Eli could dwell on it, the stranger's voice cut through the diner's clatter, low and gravelly like stones grinding together. "Coffee," they said. "Black."
