The wind whipped across the high plains of Montana, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and distant rain. Bartholomew "Bart" Clayton squinted against the sun glinting off the corrugated iron roof of his barn. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling like miniature tornadoes across the parched earth. 

Bart, a man weathered by years of sun and toil, ran a calloused hand through his greying hair. His face, etched with lines that spoke of hard work and resilience, held a grim determination. The drought had been relentless this year, sucking the life from the land and leaving his cattle gaunt and weary. 

He needed rain. He needed it desperately.
