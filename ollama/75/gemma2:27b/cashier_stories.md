The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of crumpled candy wrappers and dusty magazines at "Benny's Bargain Bazaar." Amelia Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging the air briefly before dissipating into the stale, recirculated air conditioning. Another Tuesday night. Another parade of weary shoppers with overflowing baskets and impatient sighs. 

Amelia tapped a chipped red nail against the worn surface of the checkout counter, wishing she were anywhere but here. The rhythmic beeping of the scanner, the monotonous announcements over the loudspeaker, the constant drone of human chatter â€“ it all felt like a slow, agonizing descent into monotony. Tonight, even the usual Tuesday night rush seemed absent, leaving Amelia alone with her thoughts and the flickering images on the ancient television mounted high above the dairy aisle, showcasing grainy footage of a cooking show Amelia had no interest in watching.
