Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, drumming a chaotic rhythm that mingled with the mournful bleating of sheep huddled together in the far corner. The air hung heavy and damp, thick with the scent of hay, manure, and fear. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her blonde braid plastered to her cheek by the humidity, knelt beside a trembling lamb, its tiny body shivering uncontrollably.

Amelia was known throughout the remote village nestled amongst the rolling hills of the Cotswolds as "The Animal Whisperer". It wasn't a title she'd sought, but rather one bestowed upon her due to her uncanny ability to calm even the most skittish creature. From orphaned foals to injured owls, Amelia tended to them all with a gentle touch and an unwavering compassion. Tonight, however, felt different. The storm raging outside mirrored the tempest brewing within Amelia herself. News had reached the village that the sprawling estate bordering their pastures was being sold. The new owner, a wealthy city developer, had plans to transform the idyllic landscape into a luxury resort, threatening the livelihoods of everyone who depended on the land, including Amelia and her beloved animals.
