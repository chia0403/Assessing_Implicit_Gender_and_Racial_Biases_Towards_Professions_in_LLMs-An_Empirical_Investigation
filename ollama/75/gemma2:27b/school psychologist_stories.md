Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing within her own chest. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the cluttered desk, piled high with student files and half-eaten granola bars. Outside, the sprawling campus of St. Augustine's Academy seemed to shrink beneath the onslaught of the storm, its pristine lawns dissolving into muddy expanses. Evelyn sighed, the weight of responsibility settling heavy on her shoulders.

Today was different. Today, a whisper had snaked through the hallways, a rumour tinged with fear and suspicion. A student, 17-year-old Liam O'Connell, hadn't shown up for classes. He wasn't answering his phone, and his dorm room sat eerily empty. Evelyn, tasked with understanding the complex minds of St. Augustine's diverse student body, felt a knot of dread tightening in her gut. Something was terribly wrong.
