The wind howled like a banshee across the obsidian plains, whipping Alistair Blackwood's cloak around him in frantic circles. He hunched further into his fur-lined collar, squinting through the driving snow at the hulking silhouette of Blackrock Fortress looming against the bruised horizon. Its jagged towers, carved from volcanic stone and perpetually shrouded in smoke, seemed to claw at the unforgiving sky.

Alistair had been stationed at Blackrock for five years, a lifetime it felt like. He'd seen countless storms rage across these desolate plains, witnessed the fortress endure sieges and skirmishes, but none as brutal as this. The snow was piling up fast, threatening to bury the watchtowers and obscure the path back to the main gate.

His hand instinctively tightened around the hilt of his sword, a comforting weight against the gnawing unease in his gut. Something felt different tonight, a primal tension thrumming beneath the surface of the blizzard's fury. It was a feeling he couldn't shake, a premonition whispering of unseen dangers lurking beyond the fortress walls.
