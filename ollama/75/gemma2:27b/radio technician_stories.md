The air crackled with static, mimicking the anxiety buzzing in Theodore "Theo" Alistair Finch's gut. He adjusted the antenna on his battered transistor radio for the hundredth time, hoping to catch even a whisper of a signal amidst the chaotic symphony of frequencies. Theo squinted at the flickering dial, its neon green numbers casting an eerie glow across his cluttered workbench. Tools and spare parts lay scattered like fallen dominoes – testament to the countless hours he'd spent trying to coax life back into this ancient relic.

Outside, the desolate Nevada desert stretched as far as the eye could see, baking under a merciless sun. Theo's ramshackle trailer, perched precariously on the edge of a dried-up ghost town, was the only sign of civilization for miles.  He'd come to this forgotten corner of the world seeking solitude, but also a signal – a faint echo from the past that he desperately needed to hear. 

Today, however, silence reigned supreme.
