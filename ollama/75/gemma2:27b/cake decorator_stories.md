The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and melted chocolate, punctuated by the sharp tang of almond extract. Sunlight streamed through the bakery window, catching dust motes dancing above Esme Rosalie Hawthorne's workbench. Flour dusted her apron like powdered sugar, and a stray curl escaped from her messy bun, framing her face as she painstakingly piped buttercream roses onto a three-tiered wedding cake. 

Outside, the bustling sounds of Saturday morning in Willow Creek - car horns, children laughing, dogs barking - faded into a gentle hum behind the bakery's brick walls. Inside, it was Esme's world: a symphony of clinking spatulas, whirring mixers, and the soft whisper of sugar crystals against her fingertips.
