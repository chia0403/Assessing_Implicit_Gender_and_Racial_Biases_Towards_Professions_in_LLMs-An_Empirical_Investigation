Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Chen's clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside Elizabeth "Eliza" Ramirez. She scrubbed her hands raw under the hot water, the familiar scent of antiseptic doing little to soothe her frayed nerves. The waiting room buzzed with a tense energy - coughing fits, worried whispers, and the rhythmic squeak of a rusty ceiling fan. Eliza knew this wasn't just another dreary Tuesday night in Brownsville, Texas. Word had spread like wildfire: a strange illness was sweeping through the migrant community on the outskirts of town. 

Fever, nausea, hallucinations...the symptoms were unsettlingly familiar, conjuring memories of Eliza's medical school rotations dealing with outbreaks in remote villages.  She glanced at Dr. Chenâ€™s closed door. He was hunched over his desk, poring over charts and muttering under his breath. They were outnumbered, outgunned, and racing against time to identify the culprit before it spiraled out of control.  Eliza took a deep breath, her stethoscope cold against her chest.

This was her town. Her people. She wouldn't let them down.
