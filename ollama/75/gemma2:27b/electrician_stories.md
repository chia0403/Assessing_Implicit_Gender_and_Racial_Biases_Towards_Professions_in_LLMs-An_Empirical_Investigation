Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the old warehouse, each drop echoing like a hammer blow in the cavernous space. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and dust, illuminated only by the harsh glare of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's headlamp.  He tugged on his grease-stained overalls, grumbling under his breath about the irony of needing to fix faulty wiring in a place that looked like it hadn't seen an electrician since the dawn of electricity itself. 

The warehouse stood hunched against the relentless storm, its windows boarded up and graffiti scarring its brick facade. Bart squinted through the gloom, trying to make sense of the tangled mess of wires snaking across the ceiling like a deranged spiderweb. This wasn't your average blown fuse or faulty light switch job. This felt...different. There was an unsettling hum emanating from the depths of the warehouse, a low vibration that tickled Bart's teeth and made the hairs on his arms stand on end.
