Rain lashed against the warped glass of Archibald Finchley's office window, blurring the already indistinct view of the cobblestone street below. A chill seeped through the drafty panes, settling deep in Archie's bones despite the crackling fire in the hearth. Stacks of ledgers and parchment filled every available surface, their edges softened by years of careful handling. The air was thick with the scent of ink and old paper, a comforting aroma that had permeated Archie's life since he was a boy apprenticed to his father, the town's most respected bookkeeper.

Tonight, however, the familiar scent couldn't soothe the knot of unease twisting in his gut. A letter lay open on his desk, its stark black ink scrawling an ominous message: "Meet me at the Crooked Lantern, midnight sharp. Come alone." It was unsigned, but Archie recognized the elegant flourish â€“ a signature he hadn't seen since his apprenticeship days, a ghost from his past returned to haunt him.
