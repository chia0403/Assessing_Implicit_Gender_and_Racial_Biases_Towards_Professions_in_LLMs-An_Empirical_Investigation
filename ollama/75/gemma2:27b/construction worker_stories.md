The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Petrov, turning the steel beams he was hoisting into searing brands against his tanned forearms. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes as he wrestled the heavy metal into place alongside his crewmate, Marco. Below them, the skeleton of a skyscraper clawed at the cloudy sky – a testament to human ambition and Eli's tireless labor.

The air thrummed with the cacophony of construction: the whine of power tools, the clang of dropped wrenches, and the shouted instructions echoing through the scaffolding maze. Eli loved this controlled chaos. He thrived on the physical exertion, the camaraderie forged in shared struggle, and the tangible results of his work – a building rising from the earth, brick by brick, beam by beam.

But today, something felt different. A prickling unease crept beneath his skin as he surveyed the site. The rhythmic clanging seemed off-key, the laughter of his fellow workers strained. Even the wind whistling through the girders carried an ominous note. Eli couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change, something monumental and terrifying, looming on the horizon like a gathering storm.
