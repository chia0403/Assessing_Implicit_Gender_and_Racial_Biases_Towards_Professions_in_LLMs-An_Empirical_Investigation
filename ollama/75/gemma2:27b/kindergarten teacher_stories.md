The humid Georgia air hung thick, even within the brightly colored walls of Ms. Eloise Clementine’s kindergarten classroom. Crayon drawings depicting lopsided suns and stick-figure families clung to every surface, fighting for space with alphabet charts and motivational posters featuring smiling woodland creatures.  

Eloise, her auburn hair escaping its braid in rebellious tendrils, wiped a stray smudge of purple paint from Timmy Johnson's cheek. "Remember," she said patiently, her voice like honeyed sunshine, "we use our fingers to spread the glue, not our whole hands!" Timmy giggled and promptly smeared another glob of adhesive onto his paper crown. Eloise sighed inwardly but couldn't help but smile. Kindergarten was a constant whirlwind of chaos and sweetness, and she wouldn’t trade it for anything.

But today, beneath the cheerful façade, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. Today was Parent-Teacher Night, and Eloise dreaded facing Mrs. Henderson, whose son Jeremy consistently refused to participate in class activities.
