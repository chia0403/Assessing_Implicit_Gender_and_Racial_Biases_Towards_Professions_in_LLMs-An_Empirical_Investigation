The humid Florida air clung to Elara Solstice like a second skin as she surveyed her bootcamp class. Palm trees swayed languidly in the background, their fronds casting dappled shadows on the sweaty faces below.  A chorus of groans and wheezes rose as the group attempted burpees, their bodies glistening with exertion under the relentless midday sun. Elara smiled encouragingly, her own muscles flexing beneath her bright turquoise tank top. "Come on, team!" she shouted, her voice ringing out across the grassy expanse of Clearwater Beach. "Ten more seconds! You got this!"

Elara was known for her infectious enthusiasm and no-nonsense approach to fitness. A former competitive gymnast with a physique that defied gravity, she had traded in the polished world of elite sports for the joy of helping others discover their own strength.  But today, something felt off. A niggling unease tugged at the edges of Elara's mind, a sense that someone was watching her, their gaze heavy and unfamiliar.
