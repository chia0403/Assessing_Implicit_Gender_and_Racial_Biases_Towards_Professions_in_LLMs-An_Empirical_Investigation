The rusted teeth of the Caterpillar excavator groaned as Amelia "Amy" Callahan eased it into reverse, her calloused hands deftly maneuvering the levers. Dust devils danced across the barren Nevada landscape, swirling crimson against the cloudless blue sky. The air hung thick with the scent of dry earth and diesel fumes. Beyond the sprawling expanse of sand and scrub lay the skeletal outline of a half-built casino, its steel bones reaching towards the horizon like a forgotten dream.

Amy squinted at the sun glinting off the broken windows of the abandoned project, a bitter taste rising in her throat. It was another reminder of the boom and bust cycle that plagued this desert town. One day they were building empires of glass and glitter, the next they were ghost towns littered with broken promises.  She sighed, her breath catching in the dry air, and shifted the excavator into forward gear. Time to move some dirt and try to forget.
