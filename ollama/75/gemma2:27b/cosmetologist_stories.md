The air hung thick with the scent of coconut oil and hairspray, punctuated by the sharp tang of bleach.  Priscilla "Priss" Beaumont adjusted the heavy magnifying mirror on its stand, her reflection staring back â€“ a woman with expertly sculpted brows framing eyes that sparkled like freshly polished amethyst. Her dark curls were pulled into an intricate updo, defying gravity in a swirl of ebony and caramel highlights.

Her salon, "Primped & Proper," was nestled amongst the bustling boutiques and cafes on Elm Street, its neon pink sign a beacon for those seeking beauty transformations. Today was particularly chaotic. Bridal parties were crammed into styling chairs, teenage girls giggled over manicures, and a lone gentleman nervously awaited his first ever eyebrow wax.

Priss took a deep breath, channeling her inner zen master. She thrived in the controlled chaos, finding solace in the alchemy of hair dye and the artistry of a perfect blowout. But today, a gnawing unease tugged at her. It started with a cryptic phone call from a client who spoke only in hushed tones and ended abruptly. Now, a stranger sat slumped in her waiting area, his fedora pulled low, casting his face in shadow. He refused to make eye contact, his hands fidgeting incessantly.

Something wasn't right. Priss knew it in the pit of her stomach.
