Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the Blue Moon Tavern, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont's chest. The stage lights, usually beacons of warmth and promise, felt cold and unforgiving tonight. Her fingers trembled as they danced over the worn frets of her guitar, the melody for "Heartbreak Highway" twisting into something melancholic and raw. 

The Blue Moon was Ellie's sanctuary, a dimly lit haven tucked away on a forgotten side street in New Orleans. The scent of stale beer and fried peanuts hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet notes of blues music that seeped from every crack and crevice. But tonight, the usual comfort felt hollow. A rejection letter from a prestigious record label lay crumpled in her pocket, a tangible reminder of her dreams teetering on the brink.
