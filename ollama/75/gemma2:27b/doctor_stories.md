Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Elias Blackwoodâ€™s clinic, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign into an ethereal smudge. The air inside smelled of antiseptic and stale coffee, punctuated by the occasional wheeze from a patient huddled in the waiting room. Elias, his salt-and-pepper hair plastered to his forehead, slumped onto his threadbare office chair, rubbing weary eyes.  The clinic was nestled on the edge of Havenwood, a once thriving industrial town now choked by unemployment and despair. 

A bell jangled, announcing another patient. Elias sighed, straightening his tie and forcing a tired smile. It was going to be another long night.
