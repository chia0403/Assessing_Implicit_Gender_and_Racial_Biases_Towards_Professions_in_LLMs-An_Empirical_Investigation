Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of Professor Amelia Blackwoodâ€™s study, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the ancient panes. The fire crackled in the hearth, casting dancing shadows on the shelves overflowing with leather-bound tomes and peculiar artifacts: a shrunken head from the Amazon, a chipped Mayan calendar stone, a vial filled with iridescent sand said to be from a mermaid's tear. Amelia sat hunched over her desk, a sheaf of yellowed parchment spread before her. The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and old paper, punctuated by the occasional mournful howl of the wind. 

Amelia traced the spidery script of an ancient Sumerian incantation, her brow furrowed in concentration. She was on the verge of a breakthrough, she could feel it. For months, she'd been deciphering this cryptic text, convinced it held the key to unlocking a long-forgotten secret: the location of a hidden city buried beneath the sands of Mesopotamia.
