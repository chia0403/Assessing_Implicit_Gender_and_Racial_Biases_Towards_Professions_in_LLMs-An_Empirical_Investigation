The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby hummed with the quiet symphony of privilege: the clink of champagne flutes, the rustle of silk gowns against polished marble, the murmur of conversations conducted in languages Amelia Cartwright couldn't quite place. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the potted palms that flanked the grand staircase.

Amelia Cartwright, her crisp navy uniform impeccably pressed, stood behind the mahogany concierge desk, a beacon of calm amidst the gilded chaos. Her name tag gleamed under the chandelier's warm glow: "Amelia Cartwright, Concierge." It was a title she wore with pride, for within these opulent walls, she held the keys to guests' desires, their whispered dreams and extravagant whims. 

Today, however, Amelia felt a prickle of unease. A guest, Mr. Alistair Sterling, had arrived just before noon. Dressed in an impeccably tailored suit that screamed old money, he carried himself with an air of unsettling intensity. His request was simple enough: "A room overlooking the city," he'd said, his voice smooth as velvet but laced with a hint of something cold and sharp.

But it was his gaze, lingering on Amelia for a beat too long, that sent a shiver down her spine. It was a gaze that saw not just the concierge, but the woman beneath the uniform â€“ and in its depths, Amelia glimpsed a shadow, a darkness she couldn't decipher.
