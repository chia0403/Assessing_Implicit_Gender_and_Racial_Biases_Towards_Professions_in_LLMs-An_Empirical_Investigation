Eleanor "Ellie" Ramirez, her dark ponytail escaping its elastic, checked the IV drip for the tenth time, her brow furrowed in concentration.

Ellie knew they were racing against time. Every siren wail, every red light they barreled through, amplified the urgency of their mission.  They were headed to St. Jude's, the city's renowned cardiac center, but even with Ellie's practiced expertise and the driver's relentless navigation through the storm-lashed streets, doubt gnawed at her. Would they get there in time?
