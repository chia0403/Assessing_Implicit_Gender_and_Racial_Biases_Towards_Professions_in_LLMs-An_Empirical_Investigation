The bell above the door chimed merrily as Esme Blackwood ushered in another customer, her smile as sharp and practiced as the shears she wielded.  The air inside "Esme's Snips & Strands" was thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and something faintly chemical – a mixture that always reminded Esme of home. 

The shop itself was tucked away on a side street in Brighton, its window display a riot of colourful wigs and hair extensions.  Inside, mismatched chairs lined the walls, each occupied by someone patiently waiting their turn.  Sunlight streamed through the large front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the streaks of silver threading through Esme's chestnut brown bob.

Today was shaping up to be another busy one. Tourists, drawn by the vibrant seaside town, were flocking in for a quick trim before hitting the beach. Locals, ever loyal to Esme's meticulous touch, filled the remaining slots. As she greeted her newest client – a young woman with hair like spun gold and eyes wide with nervous anticipation – Esme couldn't help but feel a familiar thrill course through her veins. This wasn't just a job; it was an art form. And in this little haven of hers, she was the maestro.
