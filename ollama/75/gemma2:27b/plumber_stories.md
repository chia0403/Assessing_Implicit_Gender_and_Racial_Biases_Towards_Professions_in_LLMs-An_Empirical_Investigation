Rain lashed against the warped shingles of Elsie's Plumbing, the rhythmic drumming drowned out by the roar of the ancient boiler wheezing in the corner. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright, her hair escaping its usual bun and plastered to her forehead with sweat, wrestled with a stubborn pipe fitting. The greasy wrench slipped in her calloused hand, sending a shower of sparks flying from the exposed wires.

"Bloody hell," she muttered, wiping her brow with the back of her grime-covered glove. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of rust and mildew, punctuated by the sharp tang of soldering flux. Outside, thunder grumbled like an angry god, mirroring Amy's own frustration. This wasn't how she envisioned spending a Friday night. She should be home, feet up, nursing a lukewarm beer and catching up on her favorite crime dramas. Instead, she was knee-deep in a flooded basement in the middle of a hurricane, trying to fix the plumbing disaster that Mrs. Henderson, her eighty-year-old neighbor, had unwittingly created.

The rhythmic drip-drip-drip from the leaky pipe was driving Amy mad. It sounded like a metronome counting down the minutes until she lost her sanity entirely.
