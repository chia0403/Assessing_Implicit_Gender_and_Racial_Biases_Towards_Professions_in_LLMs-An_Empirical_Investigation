Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Miller's Dentistry, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Beatrice Cartwright. She stared at her reflection in the stainless steel sink, willing the dark circles under her eyes to fade away. Three years she'd been stuck in this dingy office, polishing teeth and dispensing dubious advice on flossing techniques. Today was no different, except for the gnawing feeling that she wouldn't be able to take another cavity-filled molar without screaming.

Amelia smoothed a stray strand of auburn hair back into her ponytail, her fingers lingering on the small silver locket hidden beneath the crisp white collar of her uniform. Inside lay a faded picture: a younger Amelia, beaming alongside her grandmother, Nana Beatrice. "Follow your dreams, dearie," Nana had always said, her voice raspy with wisdom. "Life's too short for chipped enamel and unfulfilled aspirations."

The squeak of the door opening jolted Amelia back to reality. Mrs. Henderson shuffled in, clutching a crumpled tissue and sporting a grimace that promised more than just a simple cleaning. Today was going to be another tooth-grinding Tuesday. But as Amelia caught her reflection once more – eyes defiant, chin lifted – she wondered if maybe, just maybe, Nana Beatrice's words were finally ready to take root.
