The scent of crayons and disinfectant hung thick in the air of Sunnyside Daycare.  Amelia Cartwright, with her perpetually windswept auburn curls and a smile that could disarm even the grumpiest toddler, surveyed the chaotic scene before her. Building blocks lay scattered across the plush carpet like colorful boulders, a half-finished castle teetering precariously in the corner. Tiny giggles punctuated the air as three-year-old Lily chased a giggling Liam around the play kitchen, brandishing a plastic spoon like a sword.

Amelia loved this. The sheer, unadulterated joy of these children was infectious. Today, however, her usual buoyant mood was tinged with a flicker of anxiety. A new family was starting at Sunnyside today - the Andersons, and their adopted daughter, Luna, who was six years old and, according to the intake form, "quiet and reserved." Amelia hoped they would be a good fit for Sunnyside, but something about Luna's description tugged at her heartstrings.

She straightened the stack of picture books on the low shelf, taking a deep breath to calm her nerves. Soon enough, the doorbell would chime, signaling the arrival of the Andersons and their mysterious Luna.
