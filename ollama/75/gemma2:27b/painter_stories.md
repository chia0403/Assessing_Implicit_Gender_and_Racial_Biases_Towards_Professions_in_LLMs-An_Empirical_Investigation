The late afternoon sun dripped through the grimy windowpanes of Elara Finch's attic studio, painting long, dusty rectangles across her canvases.  A thick layer of paint coated every surface - brushstrokes on the worn wooden floorboards, splatters across the cracked plaster walls, even a colorful smear decorating her nose. Elara didn't mind. To her, this chaotic beauty was a reflection of her soul.

Outside, the cobblestone streets of Montmartre buzzed with life, tourists snapping photos of the Sacré-Cœur Basilica perched on the hilltop. But up here, amongst the tangled web of rafters and forgotten furniture, Elara found sanctuary. Today, however, even the familiar solace offered by her studio couldn't silence the gnawing unease in her gut. Her latest commission, a portrait of a wealthy Parisian socialite, was due tomorrow, and the canvas remained stubbornly blank.
