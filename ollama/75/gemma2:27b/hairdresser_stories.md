The acrid scent of bleach hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet perfume of jasmine hairspray and the faint tang of burnt toast from the diner next door. Estelle Moreau, her hands expertly wielding a pair of shears, snipped away at a client's overgrown bob. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpane of "Estelle's Snippets," casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor and illuminating the faded posters of vintage hairstyles lining the walls. Outside, the bustling energy of New Orleansâ€™ French Quarter hummed with life - street musicians serenading passersby, vendors hawking their wares, and the incessant clatter of trolleys against cobblestone streets.

But inside Estelle's Snippets, time seemed to stand still. The rhythmic snip-snip of Estelle's shears was a soothing counterpoint to the chaos outside, a symphony only she could conduct.
