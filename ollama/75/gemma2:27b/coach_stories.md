Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Rusty Bucket Diner, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into an indistinguishable smear of red and blue. Inside, steam rose from mugs of coffee, mingling with the scent of frying onions and stale grease. Coach Elijah "Eli" Thompson sat hunched over a chipped Formica table, his weary face illuminated by a flickering fluorescent light. He traced a finger along the worn surface, sketching absentminded patterns while replaying the game in his head. Another loss. Their fourth this season.  

The diner's usual hum of late-night chatter was subdued tonight, replaced by the clatter of cutlery and the occasional groan from weary truckers hunched over their plates. Eli felt a familiar knot of frustration tighten in his gut. He had poured his heart and soul into this team, these kids, but they seemed to be slipping further away with each passing game. Was it him? Was he failing them?
