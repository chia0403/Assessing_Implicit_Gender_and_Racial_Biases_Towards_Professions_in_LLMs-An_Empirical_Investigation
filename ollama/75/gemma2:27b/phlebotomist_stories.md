The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony above Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's head as she prepped the next patient for their blood draw. The air in the small clinic waiting room hung thick with anxiety and antiseptic. Esme glanced at the clock â€“ 3:47 pm. Just 13 more minutes until she could clock out, shed her blue scrubs, and escape into the sun-drenched world beyond these sterile walls.

Today, however, was proving particularly challenging. Mrs. Henderson in chair three had fainted upon seeing the needle (again), Mr. Ramirez in chair two couldn't stop fidgeting, and young Timmy in chair one, scheduled for a routine hemoglobin check, was now wailing inconsolably, convinced the vampires were coming to get him.

Esme sighed. It wasn't the blood that bothered her; it was the human element. Dealing with fear, anxiety, and the occasional tantrum was as much a part of her job as drawing blood itself. But Esme was good at what she did. She had a calming presence, a steady hand, and an uncanny ability to find veins even in the most elusive spots.
