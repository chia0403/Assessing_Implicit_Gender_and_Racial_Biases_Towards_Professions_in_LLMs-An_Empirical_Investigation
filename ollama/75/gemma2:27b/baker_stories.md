The pre-dawn air hung heavy with the scent of yeast and sugar as Amelia Rosewell unlocked the bakery door. Her breath plumed in front of her face, momentarily obscuring the frosted glass panes that displayed the day's offerings: plump croissants still warm from the oven, crusty sourdough loaves begging to be torn apart, and jewel-toned fruit tarts promising a burst of sweetness.

Amelia's small bakery nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Edinburgh was her sanctuary. The worn wooden counters, the gleaming copper pots hanging above the stove, the scent of baking bread that permeated every corner - it all felt like an extension of herself. This morning, however, a knot of anxiety tightened in her chest. Today was the annual Edinburgh Bake-Off, and Amelia, known for her innovative pastries and exquisite flavour combinations, was determined to finally win the coveted Golden Rolling Pin.
