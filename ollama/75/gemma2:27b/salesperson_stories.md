Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of "Chez Maurice" across the street into an Impressionist painting. Inside, Elias Thornhill adjusted his tie for the tenth time, the knot feeling tighter with each adjustment. The air in the cramped booth reeked faintly of stale coffee and desperation. Across from him sat Mr. Petrov, a man whose stern face could have curdled milk, tapping a rhythm on the table with a thick, gold-ringed finger. Elias knew this meeting was make or break. One sale for this revolutionary new water purification system and he'd be back on track; another rejection, and his commission streak would officially flatline. He plastered on a smile as bright as the flickering neon sign outside.

"So," Elias began, his voice carefully calibrated to project confidence and charm, "tell me, Mr. Petrov, what are your biggest concerns regarding water quality in thisâ€”"

He was cut off by Petrov's gruff, "Get to the point, Thornhill."
