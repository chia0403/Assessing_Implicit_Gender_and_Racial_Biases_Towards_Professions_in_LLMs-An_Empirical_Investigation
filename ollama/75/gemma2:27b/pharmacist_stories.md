Rain lashed against the shop window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign. Inside, Eleanor Vance straightened a crooked bottle of cough syrup with a sigh. The rhythmic drumming of the rain was starting to get to her.  It had been a slow night at Vance's Pharmacy â€“ no surprise given the torrential downpour outside. Eleanor usually relished the quiet evenings, catching up on paperwork or reading medical journals. Tonight, however, she felt a strange restlessness, a prickling anticipation that something unexpected was about to happen.  

Maybe it was the storm, she thought, pushing aside the unsettling feeling. Or maybe it was the flickering light above the door, casting long shadows that danced across the worn linoleum floor. Whatever it was, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that tonight wouldn't be like any other night at Vance's Pharmacy.
