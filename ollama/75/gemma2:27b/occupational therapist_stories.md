Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, a symphony of drumming accompanied by the occasional shriek of wind. Eleanor Hayes, her auburn hair pulled back in a practical braid, peered out at the storm raging outside. A shiver ran down her spine despite the warmth radiating from the ancient radiator beneath the window.  Eleanor wasnâ€™t usually one to be bothered by weather, but today felt different. 

Today was Ethan's first day.

Ethan Miller, a promising young artist whose world had been turned upside down by a car accident six months ago. Now confined to a wheelchair and struggling with debilitating nerve damage in his right hand, Ethan had retreated into himself, the spark that once ignited his canvases replaced by a dull ache of hopelessness. 

Eleanor, a veteran occupational therapist known for her unwavering empathy and unconventional methods, felt an unexpected wave of anxiety wash over her. Could she help Ethan rediscover the joy he had lost? Could she guide him back to the world of vibrant colors and expressive strokes?

The heavy oak door creaked open, breaking Eleanor's reverie.  She turned, a hopeful smile playing on her lips as a young man, hesitantly wheeled himself into the room. His face was pale, etched with pain and uncertainty, his right hand clenched tightly in a fist. 


This was Ethan. This was where her journey began.
