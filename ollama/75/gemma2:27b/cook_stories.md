The air hung thick with the scent of garlic, rosemary, and woodsmoke. A thin wisp escaped the open kitchen window, curling enticingly towards the cobbled street below. Inside, Esmeralda "Esme" Dubois, her forearms dusted with flour, kneaded dough with a rhythmic intensity. Sunlight streamed through the grimy panes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air and glinting off the copper pots hanging from the ceiling. Esme's small bakery, nestled amongst the crooked buildings of Rue du Four in Paris, was alive with the clatter of mixing bowls, the hiss of the oven, and the comforting murmur of her own humming.

Today was market day, and the aroma wafting from her shop promised warmth and sweetness to the weary shoppers navigating the bustling square outside.  Esme glanced at the clock - it was nearly time to pull the fresh baguettes from the oven, their crusts promising a delightful crackle under the first bite. But something felt amiss. A faint unease tugged at the edge of her contentment. Perhaps it was the unusually quiet morning, or the unsettling glint she'd seen in the eye of the old woman who'd stopped by earlier. Whatever it was, Esme couldn't shake the feeling that something unexpected was about to unfold.
