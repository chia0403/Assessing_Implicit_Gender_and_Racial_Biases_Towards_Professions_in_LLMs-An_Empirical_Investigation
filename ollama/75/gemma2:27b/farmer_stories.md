The rooster's crow cut through Elara Finch's dreams like a rusty scythe. She groaned, pulling the scratchy wool blanket tighter around her shoulders. Dawn was already painting the sky in hues of peach and lavender over the rolling hills of her family's farm, nestled in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley. A faint mist clung to the fields, obscuring the rows of plump pumpkins and cornstalks heavy with ripening ears. 

Elara sighed, knowing there was no use fighting the inevitable. She tossed back the covers, her bare feet hitting the cold wooden floorboards. Today was harvest day, a day that promised both satisfaction and exhaustion in equal measure.  She could already smell the earthy sweetness of the pumpkins, feel the rough texture of their skins under her calloused hands. The anticipation thrummed through her veins, a familiar rhythm as old as the land itself.
