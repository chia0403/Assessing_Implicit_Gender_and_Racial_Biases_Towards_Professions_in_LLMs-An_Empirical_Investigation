The Grand Blackwood Hotel loomed above Theodore "Teddy" Finch like a colossal Gothic gargoyle. Its shadowed spires clawed at the bruised twilight sky, each window a vacant eye staring down upon the bustling city below. Teddy adjusted his burgundy bellhop uniform, tugging at the stiff collar that chafed against his neck. He hated this uniform â€“ it made him feel like a glorified automaton, expected to smile and bow with mechanical precision regardless of the weariness gnawing at his bones. 

He eyed the revolving door, already anticipating the onslaught of guests arriving for tonight's gala. The Blackwood was hosting some socialite's extravagant birthday bash, meaning Teddy would be schlepping luggage up endless flights of stairs until his back ached and his smile felt frozen in place. Still, he couldn't complain too loudly. A job was a job, especially in these tough times.

As the first limo pulled up to the curb, its headlights cutting through the gathering dusk, Teddy straightened his posture and pasted on his best welcoming grin.  "Welcome to the Grand Blackwood," he chirped, bracing himself for another long night.
