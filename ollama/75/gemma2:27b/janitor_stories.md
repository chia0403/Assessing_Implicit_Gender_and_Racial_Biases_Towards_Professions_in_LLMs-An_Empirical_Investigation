The fluorescent lights hummed an off-key symphony above Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's head as she maneuvered the industrial mop around the spilled coffee in the executive breakroom. The sickly sweet aroma mingled with the disinfectant smell of her cleaner, creating a peculiar perfume unique to late-night janitorial shifts at Helios Corporation. Outside, beyond the steel and glass fa√ßade, the city slept, its twinkling lights reflecting faintly on the polished granite floor. Amy paused, catching her reflection in the dark expanse. Her face, framed by salt-and-pepper braids, was etched with fatigue, but her eyes held a spark of defiance - the same glint that had seen her through countless nights cleaning up other people's messes, both literal and figurative. 

Tonight felt different though. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, as if unseen eyes were watching from the shadows cast by the empty desks. The silence was punctuated only by the rhythmic squeak of her mop and the distant hum of the ventilation system.  Amy knew Helios Corporation held secrets, whispered in hushed tones amongst the janitorial staff: rumors of groundbreaking research, clandestine meetings, and whispers of something more sinister lurking beneath the surface.

Tonight, those whispers seemed to be growing louder.
