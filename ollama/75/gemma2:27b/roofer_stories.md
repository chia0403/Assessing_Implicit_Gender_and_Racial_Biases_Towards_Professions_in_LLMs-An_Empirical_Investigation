The midday sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck, turning the back of his shirt into a damp, sweat-soaked rag.  He perched precariously on the steep gable of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian home, hammer in hand, the scent of hot tar and cedar shingles filling his nostrils.

Below him, the manicured lawns of Elm Street stretched out like a green carpet, dotted with brightly colored flowerbeds. The rhythmic chirping of cicadas filled the air, punctuated by the distant rumble of a garbage truck. Silas, however, barely registered any of it. His focus was entirely on the task at hand: replacing a section of warped shingles before the next summer storm rolled in. 

He was known throughout the neighborhood as "Silas the Steady," a moniker earned through years of reliable work and an unflinching nerve when perched atop even the tallest roofs. But today, something felt different. A prickling unease settled beneath his skin, a feeling that intensified with every gust of wind that rattled the loose shingles.
