Sawdust danced in the afternoon sunlight slanting through the grimy windowpane of Alistair Finnigan's workshop. The air hung thick with the scent of pine and sweat, punctuated by the rhythmic rasp of Alistair's plane gliding over a slab of cherrywood. Outside, the cobbled streets of Edinburgh hummed with the usual Saturday bustle, but within the cramped confines of his shop, time seemed to flow at a different pace â€“ slow, deliberate, measured in the shaving-thin curls that spiraled onto the sawdust-covered floor. 

Alistair, a man whose hands were as gnarled and weathered as the ancient oak beams he sometimes salvaged, paused his work, squinting at the piece taking shape under his expert touch. It was to be a cradle, a gift for his niece's newborn child, a delicate construction of swirling wood grain and intricate joinery, imbued with the love and patience only a master craftsman could bestow.
