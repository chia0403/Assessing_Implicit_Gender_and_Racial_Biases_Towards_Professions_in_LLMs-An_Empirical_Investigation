Rain lashed against the windows of Elara Beaumont's studio apartment, each drop sounding like a miniature hammer blow on the glass. The city lights outside were blurred by the downpour, turning the familiar cityscape into an impressionist painting. Inside, however, everything was crisp and ordered: swatches of fabric in jewel tones lay neatly arranged on her drafting table, a half-finished sketch of a living room design pinned to the wall beside it. Elara herself, a petite woman with fiery red hair pulled back in a practical braid, was perched on a stool, meticulously measuring the curve of an antique armchair she'd just acquired at auction. 

This chair, with its faded velvet upholstery and intricately carved mahogany frame, was destined for Mrs. Van Derlyn's library, a space Elara envisioned as a haven of warmth and sophistication. The challenge, however, lay in blending this vintage piece with the contemporary art collection Mrs. Van Derlyn prized so dearly.

Elara took a deep breath, letting the scent of old wood and beeswax soothe her. This was what she loved: taking disparate elements – a splash of color here, a touch of history there – and weaving them into a cohesive, beautiful whole. But this time, something felt different. A shiver ran down her spine, as if an unseen presence had entered the room. The rhythmic tapping of the rain seemed to intensify, echoing a growing unease within her.
