Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop sounding like a tiny hammer blow. The wind howled down the dusty street outside, whipping sand against the windowpanes. Inside, Eloise Marie Dupont, RN, was fighting a losing battle with a stubborn blood pressure cuff. It refused to stay inflated on the withered arm of Mr. Okafor, a man whose age was as difficult to determine as his ailment. He coughed, a rasping sound that seemed to echo through the small, sparsely furnished room. Eloise sighed.  She needed a new cuff, and this clinic, nestled in the heart of the Namib Desert, couldn't afford much. 


Let me know if you'd like me to continue the story! I can develop the plot further, introduce other characters, or explore Eloise's backstory.
