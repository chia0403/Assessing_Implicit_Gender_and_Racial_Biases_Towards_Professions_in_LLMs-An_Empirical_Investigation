Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the drumming rhythm in Eliza Blackwood’s chest. Outside, London was drowning beneath a grey sky, the city lights blurring into halos through the downpour. Inside, Eliza hunched over her ancient oak desk, its surface scratched and scarred like an old battlefield map. A half-empty mug of lukewarm tea sat beside a stack of crumpled pages – her latest manuscript, abandoned in frustration.

The story wasn’t flowing. The characters felt flat, their motivations muddled. Eliza sighed, pushing away from the desk and pacing the cramped room. She needed inspiration, something to ignite the spark within her dormant imagination. Perhaps a walk would help, a chance encounter with the unpredictable tapestry of city life. Or maybe she needed to delve deeper into the world she was creating, face the shadows lurking beneath its surface.
