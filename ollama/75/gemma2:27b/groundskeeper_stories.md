The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy over Silas Thaddeus Blackwood as he knelt amongst the azaleas, carefully snipping away dead blooms. Sunlight filtered through the ancient oak canopy above, dappling the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Cemetery in a mosaic of light and shadow. Silas preferred working before the sun reached its zenith, when the only sounds were the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant cawing of crows.

Willow Creek was more than just his workplace; it was a sanctuary, a place where time seemed to slow, allowing him to contemplate the mysteries of life and death amidst the tranquil beauty of sculpted hedges and weathered headstones. Silas, with his calloused hands and quiet demeanor, knew every inch of the sprawling cemetery like the back of his own hand. He'd been tending its grounds for over two decades, a silent guardian of memories etched in stone.

But this morning, something felt different. A palpable tension lingered in the air, punctuated by the unsettling screech of a hawk circling overhead. As Silas straightened up, wiping sweat from his brow, he noticed a figure standing motionless beneath a towering magnolia tree. The silhouette was shrouded in shadow, their face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat. An uneasy feeling prickled at the back of Silas's neck. He couldn't shake the sense that something was amiss.
