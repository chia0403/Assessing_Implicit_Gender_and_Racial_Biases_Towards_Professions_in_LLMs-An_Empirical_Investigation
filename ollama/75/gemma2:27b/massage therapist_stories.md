Rain lashed against the windows of "Serenity Now," blurring the neon OPEN sign into a watercolour smudge. Inside, Eleanor Rose Cartwright sighed, her fingers drumming lightly on the polished mahogany table that held her appointment book. It was a Tuesday, and Tuesdays were notoriously slow. Usually, she'd be weaving magic with her hands, easing tension from knotted shoulders and weary backs. Today, however, the only tension she felt was the tightness in her own chest, brought on by an empty schedule and a mounting pile of bills. 

Eleanor ran a hand through her unruly auburn curls, catching a glimpse of herself in the mirrored wall. Her usually bright green eyes seemed dull, reflecting the gloom of the day. The scent of lavender and chamomile oil, normally calming and inviting, felt oppressive in the stillness of the room.  She longed for the rhythmic kneading, the gentle stretching, the sighs of relief that marked a successful session.
