The neon sign outside flickered, casting an erratic purple glow onto the rain-slicked cobblestones. Inside "The Rusty Sprocket," Amelia Blackwood wiped down the mahogany bar with a practiced hand, her movements slow and rhythmic. The air was thick with the scent of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and something faintly floral – probably from Mrs. O'Malley's perpetually wilting bouquet in the corner.

It was a Tuesday night, the slowest of the week. A lone figure slumped at the far end, nursing a whiskey that looked older than Amelia herself.  Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the already indistinct view of the alley behind the bar. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic drip from a leaky faucet and the occasional groan from the man in the corner. 

Amelia sighed. Another night of waiting for something – anything – to happen. Little did she know, tonight would be far from ordinary.
