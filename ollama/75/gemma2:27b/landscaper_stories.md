The midday sun beat down on Elias Blackwood's neck, turning his already tanned skin the color of roasted coffee beans. Sweat trickled down his temples, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a recalcitrant rose bush. It was refusing to be tamed, its thorny limbs snaking out like angry vipers. 

Elias' worksite wasn't your typical manicured suburban lawn. He stood in the heart of Whispering Pines, an abandoned Victorian estate perched precariously on the edge of a cliff overlooking the roiling gray ocean. The once-grand gardens were now overgrown with weeds and tangled vines, remnants of forgotten beauty struggling to survive amidst the decay. 

Elias had been hired by the estate's new owner, a reclusive artist named Ophelia Bellweather, who wanted to restore the gardens to their former glory. He wasn't sure what he was expecting, but the eerie silence of the place and the ghostly outline of the crumbling mansion against the stormy sky sent shivers down his spine.  

He wiped the sweat from his brow, eyeing the rose bush with a mixture of frustration and grudging admiration. It was a fighter, this one. Just like him.
