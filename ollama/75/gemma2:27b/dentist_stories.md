Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of Dr. Elias Blackwood's practice, blurring the already faded sign that read "Blackwood Dentistry: Where Smiles Bloom." The rhythmic drumming of droplets on glass mirrored the nervous tap-tap-tap of Elias's foot beneath his mahogany desk.  He hadn't seen a patient in three days. Three agonizing days since Mrs. Henderson, the town librarian, had gasped and fainted upon seeing her reflection post-filling, muttering something about "a devil's grin" before dashing out.

Elias was starting to doubt his vocation. He'd always dreamt of being a dentist, of easing pain and crafting perfect smiles. But lately, whispers followed him through the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven: "Blackwood's work ain't right," they hissed, "Something unnatural about 'em."  He needed to regain their trust, but how could he when even his own reflection seemed to mock him with a lopsided smirk?
