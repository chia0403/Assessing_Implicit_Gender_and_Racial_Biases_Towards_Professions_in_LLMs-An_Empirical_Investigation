The insistent chirping pierced through Elara Montgomery's sleep like a tiny, feathered alarm clock. Groaning, she swatted blindly at the bedside table, knocking over a stack of dog-eared textbooks on avian medicine. The chirping escalated into a frantic squawking, confirming her suspicions - it was Fitzwilliam, her perpetually melodramatic cockatiel, demanding breakfast before sunrise.

Elara lived above her veterinary clinic in a quaint, cobblestoned alleyway tucked away from the bustle of downtown Willow Creek. The air outside smelled of damp earth and woodsmoke, a scent that always reminded her of childhood summers spent at her grandmother's farm. 


Today, however, there was an added edge to the familiar scent - a hint of something metallic, acrid, unsettling. Elara frowned, pushing aside the sleep-fog and reaching for Fitzwilliamâ€™s cage. As she lifted him out, his normally vibrant yellow plumage looked dull and ruffled. He chirped weakly, burying his head beneath her hand. Something was wrong.

Very wrong.
