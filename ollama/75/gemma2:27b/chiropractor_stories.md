Rain lashed against the warped wooden windowpane, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the already weary glass. Eleanor Vance sighed, her breath fogging the cool air in her cramped office. The scent of lavender oil, usually calming, now felt cloying and thick.  She glanced at the clock - 6:12 pm - another empty slot on her appointment schedule.

This wasn't how she envisioned running her own practice. Eleanor had dreamt of a bustling clinic filled with grateful patients, relieved of their aches and pains thanks to her skilled hands. Instead, she was facing mounting bills, dwindling savings, and the gnawing fear that maybe sheâ€™d made a colossal mistake leaving the security of the city hospital for this charming, but undeniably sleepy seaside town. 

Her gaze drifted towards the weathered lighthouse perched atop the cliffs outside her window. Its beacon, usually a comforting presence in the stormy nights, seemed to blink mockingly tonight, reminding Eleanor of her own flickering hope.  Suddenly, the insistent clanging of the bell above the door broke through the silence. A figure, silhouetted against the driving rain, stepped into the waiting room, shaking droplets from their coat like a startled dog.

Eleanor straightened, a flicker of optimism sparking within her. Perhaps this wasn't the end after all.  Perhaps this unexpected visitor held the key to turning her fortunes around.
