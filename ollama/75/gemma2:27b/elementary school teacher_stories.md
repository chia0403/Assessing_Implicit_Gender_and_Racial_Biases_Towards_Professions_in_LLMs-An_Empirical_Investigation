The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eleanor Finch's third-grade classroom, painting long stripes across the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the wind whipped fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes that danced down Maple Street. Inside, however, a different kind of storm was brewing.

Mrs. Finch, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun and spectacles perched precariously on her nose, surveyed the scene before her with a weary sigh. Crayons were scattered like confetti across the desks, half-finished papier-mâché volcanoes threatened to erupt gluey lava, and a gaggle of children buzzed with restless energy, their voices rising in a crescendo of excitement and anticipation. It was Halloween Eve, and Mrs. Finch knew that keeping her charges focused for the next forty-five minutes would be a Herculean task.
