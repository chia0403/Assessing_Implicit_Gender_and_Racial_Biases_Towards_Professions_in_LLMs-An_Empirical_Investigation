The air inside the Boeing 747 hummed with a low, constant thrum, the only sound besides the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia "Amy" Celeste's heels on the polished metal floor. She was finishing her pre-flight safety demonstration, her voice as bright and clear as the crisp blue skies outside the plane window. The sun was just beginning to dip below the horizon, painting the clouds in hues of orange and purple, a breathtaking backdrop for their flight from Los Angeles to London. Amy loved these moments â€“ the quiet anticipation before departure, the hushed murmur of passengers settling into their seats, the collective breath held as the engines roared to life.  

It was always different though, every flight. One minute it was laughter echoing through the aisles, the next, a child's tearful meltdown, or the unnerving silence of someone hiding a secret. Today, Amy sensed something off. There was a tension in the air, a prickling awareness that something was about to happen.  It was a feeling she couldn't shake, and it settled like a stone in her stomach. 


This wasn't just another flight. This flight felt different.
