The air in Penelope Evelyn Kensington's office hung thick with tension. A single ray of afternoon sun sliced through the blinds, illuminating the dust motes swirling lazily above her mahogany desk. She drummed her fingers on the polished surface, the rhythm punctuated by the insistent tapping of her secretaryâ€™s heels against the plush carpet outside her door.

A brilliant, audacious solution that would not only salvage her company but solidify her position as one of the most powerful women in New York City.  But where could she possibly find it?
