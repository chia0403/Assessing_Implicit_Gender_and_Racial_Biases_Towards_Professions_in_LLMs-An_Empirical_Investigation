The afternoon sun beat down on Amelia Thistlewick's neck as she surveyed her audience. Twenty pairs of eyes, hungry for history and hopefully not sunburn, stared expectantly at her from beneath their wide-brimmed hats. The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and horse dung, a peculiar but undeniably Parisian combination.

Amelia cleared her throat, adjusting the strap of her satchel that held maps, pamphlets, and an arsenal of historical anecdotes. "Welcome, mes amis," she began in a voice as smooth as the finest French butter, "to the Catacombs of Paris! A journey beneath the bustling streets, into the heart of...well, let's just say millions upon millions of Parisians."

She gestured towards the narrow entrance, shrouded in shadow and whispering promises of secrets long buried. The group shuffled forward, a tapestry of nationalities woven together by their shared fascination with the macabre. Amelia took a deep breath, her pulse quickening with the thrill of another tour beginning. She loved sharing these hidden histories, weaving tales of forgotten lives and echoing whispers of eternity. But beneath the excitement, a knot of unease tightened in her chest. Today, something felt different. The air hummed with an unfamiliar energy, as if the bones themselves were stirring in their slumber.
