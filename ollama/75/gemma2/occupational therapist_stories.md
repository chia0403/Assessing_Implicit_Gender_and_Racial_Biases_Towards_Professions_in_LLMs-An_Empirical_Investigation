The scent of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s small therapy room.  Rain lashed against the window, blurring the otherwise vibrant colors of the children's mural painted on the wall – a fantastical scene of unicorns frolicking with rainbow-winged fairies. 

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear as she observed eight-year-old Leo Garcia staring sullenly at his Lego castle. His small frame sat hunched over the table, fingers twitching nervously around a brightly colored building block. He’d been like this ever since the accident – withdrawn, quiet, and seemingly unable to find joy in anything, even Legos, once his favorite pastime.  

Leo's injury – a fractured wrist requiring surgery and weeks of restricted movement – had not only impacted his physical abilities but seemed to have cast a shadow over his entire spirit. Amelia knew she had her work cut out for her. He needed more than just physical therapy; he needed something to rekindle the spark, the playful glint in his eyes that had once shone so brightly.  


The gentle hum of the rain outside continued, a constant reminder of the storm raging within Leo, one Amelia hoped to navigate with patience and creativity.
