The air shimmered above the endless ochre expanse of the Namib Desert.  

Captain Elara "El" Rhys adjusted her goggles, squinting against the glare as she scanned the horizon from the cockpit of her battered old biplane, affectionately nicknamed "Phoenix." Dust devils danced in the distance, mimicking the turmoil brewing within her. This wasn't just another routine cargo run between Windhoek and Lüderitz.  

Elara had a secret – a dangerous, whispered rumour that had reached her ears through the grapevine of desert pilots: a hidden oasis somewhere in the heart of the desolate landscape, rumored to hold ancient secrets and untold riches. A myth most dismissed as drunken ramblings around campfires, but Elara felt a pull, an undeniable urge to unravel the truth. 


This wasn't about profit; it was about proving something to herself, to those who had always underestimated her, a woman carving out a life in a man's world. And maybe, just maybe, finding a little bit of magic in the vastness of the Namibian sky.
