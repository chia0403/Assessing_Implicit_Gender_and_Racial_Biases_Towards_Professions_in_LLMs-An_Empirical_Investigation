The air in the Grand Blackwood Library hung heavy with the scent of old paper and beeswax polish, a comforting aroma for Eleanor Thistlewick, Head Librarian since her eighteenth year. The sun slanted through the arched windows, casting dusty beams across the towering shelves that held centuries of whispered stories, forgotten histories, and worlds yet to be imagined.  

Eleanor adjusted her spectacles, her gaze lingering on a small boy tugging at his motherâ€™s skirt, eyes wide with wonder as he gazed up at the endless rows of books. She smiled, remembering her own childhood visits to this sanctuary, how the sheer volume of knowledge had both intimidated and enthralled her.  

This afternoon, however, a different kind of tension thrummed beneath the usual tranquility. A thin, white envelope lay on her desk, its edges crisp and sealed with crimson wax.  It bore no return address, only a single word scrawled in elegant script: "Beware." 


 Eleanor's brow furrowed. This was no ordinary delivery. Something in the air, something beyond the usual rustle of turning pages and hushed whispers, felt unsettlingly out of place.
