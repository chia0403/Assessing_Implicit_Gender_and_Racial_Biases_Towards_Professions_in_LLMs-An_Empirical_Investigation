The stale scent of lavender oil and peppermint lotion hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Eleanor Vance as she adjusted her glasses and surveyed the waiting room. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stillness.  Eleanor, with her chestnut hair pulled back into a neat bun and a crisp white lab coat over a faded green blouse, was the only movement in the otherwise tranquil space.

She tapped her pen rhythmically against a worn leather notebook, her gaze flitting across the faces of the three patients seated quietly on the plush, velvet chairs. A young woman with tear-streaked cheeks cradled her swollen ankle, an elderly gentleman chewed nervously on his lip, and a burly man with tattooed arms fidgeted in his seat. Each held a silent plea for relief, each hoping that Dr. Vance could untangle their knotted pain.

The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival â€“ a tall woman with fiery red hair pulled back in a loose braid. Eleanor smiled, her gaze welcoming and reassuring, before turning to greet her next patient, ready to delve into the intricate mechanics of the human body, one spine at a time.
