The rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel echoed through the cavernous workshop, a familiar lullaby to Finnigan Alistair Stonehammer. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty skylights high above, painted stripes of warmth across his worn workbench. Around him, rough blocks of granite and marble lay dormant, waiting for his touch to transform them into something beautiful. Outside, the bustling marketplace of Port Aethel hummed with activity, a cacophony of bartering voices and hawkers' cries, but inside Finnigan's workshop, time flowed at its own pace, measured by the slow dance between stone and chisel. 

Today, however, the usual calm was disrupted. A nervous tremor ran through his calloused hands as he held aloft a slab of obsidian, darker than night itself, with veins of silver running like icy rivers through its depths. It had arrived that morning, commissioned by a shadowy figure who offered only cryptic instructions and a generous sum of gold. This wasn't just any commission; this stone felt different, pulsed with an energy that made Finnigan uneasy. He knew, deep in his gut, that whatever he carved from it wouldn't be merely beautiful - it would be something more, something powerful, perhaps even dangerous.
