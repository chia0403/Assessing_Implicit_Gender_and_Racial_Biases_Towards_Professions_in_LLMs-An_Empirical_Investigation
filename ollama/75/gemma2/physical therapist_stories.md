The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to Amelia "Amy" Rosebrook like a second skin. She moved with practiced grace through the bustling rehabilitation center, her footsteps echoing on the polished linoleum floor. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, casting long shadows across the various stations: a row of treadmills humming softly, weights clanging rhythmically, and patients stretching languidly under the watchful eye of trainers.  

Amy paused at the doorway to a small treatment room, taking a deep breath before entering. She was about to meet her newest patient, Mr. William Hayes, a retired carpenter with a fractured hip sustained during a fall in his workshop. His case file detailed a gruff demeanor and reluctance to cooperate, a common challenge for Amy who thrived on seeing patients regain their mobility and confidence.  

The room was sparsely furnished: a sturdy examination table covered with a worn green sheet, a collection of metal tools laid out neatly on a cart, and a window offering a view of the center's meticulously manicured garden â€“ a stark contrast to Mr. Hayes' rough exterior.  


Amy smiled, her hand hovering over the door handle. Time to get to work.
