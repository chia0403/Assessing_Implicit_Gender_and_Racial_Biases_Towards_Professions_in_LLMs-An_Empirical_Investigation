The July sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he carefully navigated the treacherous pitch of Mrs. Peterson's Victorian roof. A gust of wind whipped around him, snatching loose shingles and sending them skittering across the slate tiles below. 

Bartholomew tugged his worn baseball cap further down, shielding his face from the glare. The air was thick with the scent of hot asphalt and damp wood, a familiar aroma he'd come to associate with both triumph and peril.  He gripped the trowel tighter, focusing on the task at hand: patching Mrs. Peterson's leaky roof before another downpour turned her attic into a swimming pool.

The house sat perched on a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Willow Creek, its gabled roof jutting against the azure sky like a forgotten fairytale castle. From this vantage point, Bart could see the entire town spread out below, a patchwork quilt of green lawns and vibrant flower boxes. But right now, his world was confined to this steep, sun-baked expanse, where every step felt like a gamble against gravity.
