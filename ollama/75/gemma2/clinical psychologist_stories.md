The flickering neon sign outside Dr. Evelyn Amelia Pierce's office cast a sickly green glow across her face as she read the patient file for the evening. "Johnathan Hayes," it read in bold font, "27, male, presenting with symptoms of acute anxiety and insomnia." Below, a scribbled note: "Possible PTSD trigger?" Johnathan was scheduled to arrive at seven pm sharp. Evelyn glanced at the clock; 6:45 PM.

Her office was nestled on the second floor of a nondescript brick building in the heart of Chicago's bustling West Loop. The city noise, a constant hum of car horns and distant sirens, seeped through the thin walls, punctuated by the occasional mournful wail of a police siren. Inside, her office was a haven of calm: soft teal walls, plush beige armchairs, and a large window overlooking a quiet alleyway where laundry hung limply on lines strung between fire escapes. A diffuser hummed quietly in the corner, releasing the scent of lavender and rosemary. 

Despite the peaceful ambiance, Evelyn felt a prickle of unease. She'd worked with countless patients over her years as a clinical psychologist, but something about Johnathan Hayes' file unsettled her. Perhaps it was the cryptic note or the way his name seemed to echo in the stillness of the office, waiting for him to arrive and fill the room with life.
