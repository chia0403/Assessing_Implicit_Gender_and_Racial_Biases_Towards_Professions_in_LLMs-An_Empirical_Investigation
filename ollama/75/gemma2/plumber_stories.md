The air hung thick with the scent of chlorine and mildew in the locker room of "Swim City,"  a once-thriving aquatic center now teetering on the brink of closure. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the downpour brewing within Evelyn "Evie" Beatrice Plumber's chest. She wasn't supposed to be here. Plumbers weren't typically called upon for lifeguard duty. But Evie had a reputation for being resourceful, her toolkit as extensive as her knowledge of pipes and pressure valves. The mayor's wife, a woman whose vanity was only surpassed by her entitlement, insisted on calling the "best plumber in town" to fix the flooded pool deck, rather than admit defeat to the local council's budgetary cuts. 

Evie wiped her forehead with a damp towel, her brow furrowed as she surveyed the scene. A mangled drainpipe lay twisted on the floor, spewing out a steady stream of rusty water. The lifeguard stand looked like it had been attacked by a pack of rabid squirrels, its laminated posters ripped and scattered around the room. It wasn't just the plumbing that needed fixing; this entire place was in desperate need of a rescue mission.
