The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Silas Blackwood. Sunlight dripped through the canopy, dappling the forest floor in emerald and gold as he surveyed his domain.

Silas, with calloused hands and a stoic gaze, was the latest Blackwood to carry on this legacy, wielding his axe with the practiced grace of a sculptor, shaping the giants into beams that would become the backbone of towns far beyond the forest's edge. 

Today, however, felt different. A disquiet hung in the air, heavier than the morning mist. The usually vibrant symphony of birdsong was muted, replaced by an unsettling stillness. Even the wind seemed to whisper secrets through the leaves, secrets that pricked at Silasâ€™s unease.  He knew this forest like the back of his hand, and something was amiss. 


This story unfolds in the heart of the Redwood National Park, a sprawling wilderness on the northern coast of California, where towering redwoods cast long shadows and ancient magic whispers through the boughs.
