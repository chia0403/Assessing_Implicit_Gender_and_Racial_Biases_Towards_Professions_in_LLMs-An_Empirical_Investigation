The aroma of burnt toast hung thick in Dr. Amelia Eleanor Vance's tiny office, mingling with the faint scent of lavender essential oil she diffused to combat the lingering smell. Her cluttered desk was a monument to her work-life imbalance: half-read journals on attachment theory, forgotten mugs filled with cold coffee, and an alarming number of sticky notes reminding her to "schedule bloodwork" and "call Aunt Mildred."  

Amelia glanced out the rain-streaked window at the grey Seattle sky. The constant drizzle mirrored the gloom that had settled over her practice lately. Her clients were struggling – anxiety, depression, relationship issues – all symptoms amplified by the oppressive atmosphere of the city itself. 

Her next appointment was due any minute, and Amelia felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her chest. This wasn't about the patient; it was about her own ability to offer solace and guidance when she herself felt adrift. Taking a deep breath, she smoothed down her unruly auburn hair, trying to convince herself that behind the chaos, somewhere inside, there was still a competent, compassionate therapist ready to help.
