The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aethelgard, carrying with it the scent of salt and the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead. The sun, a pale disc obscured by swirling grey clouds, offered little warmth to Sergeant Elara Nightshade as she patrolled the crumbling stone wall that marked the border between Aethelgard and the Shadowlands. 

Her worn leather jerkin did little to shield her from the chill, and frost clung stubbornly to her braid of dark hair. The rhythmic crunch of snow under her boots was the only sound besides the wind, a silence broken only occasionally by the distant clang of metal on stone as another patrol shifted position along the endless wall. 


Elara's gaze swept across the desolate landscape, searching for any sign of movement beyond the frozen wasteland. For years, she had patrolled these lonely borders, guarding against the horrors that lurked in the Shadowlands â€“ creatures of darkness and twisted magic who sought to breach the wall and spill into Aethelgard. Tonight, however, felt different. An unease, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck, told her something was amiss.
