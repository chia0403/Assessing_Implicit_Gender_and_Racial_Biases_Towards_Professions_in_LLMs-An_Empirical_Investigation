The flickering neon sign outside "Benny's Burger Barn" cast a sickly green glow across Beatrice Henrietta Thistlewick's ledger. She chewed on the end of her pen, the plastic tasting faintly of stale coffee and disappointment. Another night, another stack of receipts that seemed to defy any semblance of order. Benny, the owner, had promised a raise if Beatrice could "tame the beast" – his finances. But with rent money disappearing faster than flies in a sugar bowl, Beatrice felt like she was battling a hydra, each severed head replaced by two more.

Benny's Burger Barn wasn't exactly a culinary masterpiece. The burgers were greasy, the fries limp, and the milkshake machine perpetually threatened to explode. It was located on the outskirts of Hollow Creek, a sleepy town in the heart of rural Oregon where gossip traveled faster than the local mailman. Beatrice, however, found solace in the predictable chaos. She liked the rhythm of the cash register, the aroma of burnt onions, and the grumpy familiarity of the regulars who always ordered the same thing: Benny's Special – a monstrosity consisting of two patties, cheese that resembled plastic, and a sauce that could only be described as "mystery."


Beatrice knew every nook and cranny of Benny's Burger Barn.  She knew which booths were haunted by lost napkins, which ketchup bottles leaked, and the exact angle to shine her flashlight under the cash register to catch any stray change. It wasn't glamorous, but it was home.  At least until she figured out what was really happening to Benny's money.
