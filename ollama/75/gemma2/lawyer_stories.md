The humid Georgia air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain as Amelia "Amy" Claire Beaumont adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the courtroom. Her heels clicked rhythmically on the polished hardwood floor, a counterpoint to the hushed murmurs of anticipation that rippled through the assembled crowd.
