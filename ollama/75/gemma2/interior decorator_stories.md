The air hung thick with the scent of fresh paint and lilies, an incongruous mix that always made Eleanor Thistlewick wrinkle her nose.

This wasn't just another job for Eleanor Thistlewick, the most sought-after interior decorator in Willow Creek; it was an opportunity to breathe life into something forgotten, to turn the mundane into the extraordinary.
