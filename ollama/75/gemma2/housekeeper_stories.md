The scent of lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne as she surveyed the grand foyer of Blackwood Manor. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, painting the marble floor in vibrant hues of amethyst and ruby. A lone grandfather clock ticked in the corner, its measured chime echoing through the cavernous space.  Amelia ran a gloved hand along the polished banister, her gaze drifting to the worn tapestry depicting a hunt, each thread a silent testament to centuries of stories woven within these walls. She hummed softly, her footsteps quiet against the hardwood as she ascended the sweeping staircase, ready to begin another day amidst the gilded cages and hushed whispers of Blackwood Manor.

But beneath the surface of polished surfaces and impeccable order, Amelia sensed a current of unrest, a disquiet that lingered like the faint scent of woodsmoke in the air.
