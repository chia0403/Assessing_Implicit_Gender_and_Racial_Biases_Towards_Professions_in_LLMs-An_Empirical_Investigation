The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sterile glow on her meticulously organized spreadsheets. Her office, tucked away in the back corner of a bustling accounting firm downtown, felt more like a monk's cell than a place of commerce. Every surface was bare except for a few well-worn textbooks and a framed photograph of a grumpy tabby cat named Mr. Bigglesworth, perched atop a pile of tax returns.

Her world was one of numbers, formulas, and endless columns of figures, a comforting order amidst the chaos of the outside world. But today, that familiar comfort felt like an unwelcome weight, pressing down on her chest with each click of her keyboard. A sense of unease, as unfamiliar as it was persistent, had wormed its way into Amelia's meticulously ordered existence.

It wasn't anything concrete, just a subtle dissonance, like a misplaced decimal point in the grand equation of life. And now, as she stared at the latest batch of financial statements, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, deeply off.
