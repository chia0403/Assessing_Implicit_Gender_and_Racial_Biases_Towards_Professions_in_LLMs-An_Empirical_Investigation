The amber glow of the antique lamps cast long shadows across the polished mahogany bar, mirroring the fatigue etched on Amelia Rose Hawthorne's face. The air in "The Drunken Mermaid" was thick with the scent of spilled whiskey and simmering regret, a familiar aroma that clung to her like a second skin. It was late, nearly two in the morning, and the usual motley crew of regulars were dwindling down to a handful: a weary truck driver nursing a double bourbon, a couple whispering secrets over sticky shots of tequila, and a solitary woman hunched over a glass of red wine, her face hidden behind a curtain of dark hair. Amelia, with her worn apron stained with countless spills and her hands calloused from years of shaking cocktails, was the anchor in this sea of sorrows, dispensing solace one pour at a time. The city outside slept beneath a blanket of fog, but within The Drunken Mermaid's walls, stories unfolded like whispered secrets, fueled by cheap liquor and even cheaper dreams.
