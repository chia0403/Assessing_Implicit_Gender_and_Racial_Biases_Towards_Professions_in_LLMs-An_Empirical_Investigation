The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Thornhill's back like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat stinging his eyes despite the wide-brimmed hat pulled low over his forehead.  He wiped his brow with the back of his gloved hand, leaving a smear of grit across his forehead. Dust devils danced in the relentless heat shimmering off the asphalt ribbon of Highway 97 that snaked its way through the desolate Arizona desert. The highway was Eli's world: endless miles of grey tarmac stretching to meet a sky so blue it hurt to look at.

Eli worked for Arizona State Highways, and his crew was currently patching a particularly treacherous stretch plagued by potholes the size of small swimming pools. Each pothole held the potential for disaster – a shredded tire, a panicked swerve, a mangled car. Eli took pride in keeping the highway safe, even if it meant toiling under this merciless sun, surrounded by nothing but cacti and tumbleweeds.  He was a man of few words, finding solace in the rhythm of his work: the clang of the jackhammer, the rumble of the asphalt roller, the hiss of the sealant. Today, though, something felt different. A prickling at the back of his neck, an unexplainable unease that made him pause and scan the horizon.  The desert was silent, too silent for a place like this, but beneath the stillness, Eli swore he could hear a whisper – a low, unsettling hum vibrating in the air.
