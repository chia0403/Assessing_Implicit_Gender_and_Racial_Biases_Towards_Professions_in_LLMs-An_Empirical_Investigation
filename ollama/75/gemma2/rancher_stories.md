The sun bled crimson across the endless expanse of the Montana plains, casting long shadows from the weathered fence posts that marked Bartholomew "Bart" Hayes' property line. A low wind whipped through the tallgrass, carrying the scent of sagebrush and impending rain. Bart squinted at the horizon, a familiar knot tightening in his gut. It wasnâ€™t just the approaching storm; it was the emptiness stretching before him, a vast canvas of untamed land that mirrored the hollowness he felt within. The drought had lasted for months, parching the earth and stealing the life from his cattle. His family ranch, Hayes Creek, had weathered storms before, but this one threatened to consume everything they'd built. 


Bart shifted his weight on the rickety porch of his aging farmhouse, a hand resting on the worn handle of his grandfather's revolver. It felt cold against his skin, a grim reminder of the choices he might soon be forced to make.  The thunder rumbled in the distance, echoing the turmoil brewing inside him.
