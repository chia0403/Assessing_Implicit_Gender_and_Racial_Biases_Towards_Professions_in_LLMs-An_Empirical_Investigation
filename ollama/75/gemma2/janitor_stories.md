The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. A thin layer of dust coated everything in the University Library's bowels, even the exposed filament bulbs that cast an anemic glow over Eleanor "Ellie" Mae Bumblebottom's grimy work gloves.  She pushed her cart down the labyrinthine corridor, the wheels groaning like arthritic knees against the linoleum floor. Moonlight sliced through a grime-coated skylight, illuminating dancing motes of dust and highlighting Ellie's tired eyes, framed by wisps of greying hair escaping from her tight bun. 

Ellie was used to the emptiness of late nights in the library. Used to the rustling whispers of forgotten tomes, the scent of aging paper, and the echoing click of her own cart wheels on the worn floor.  But tonight felt different. The silence held a new edge, a prickling awareness that something lurked just beyond her perception.
