Rain lashed against Sergeant Amelia Harper's trench coat as she stood on the precipice of the cliffside overlooking the churning, grey sea.  Salt spray stung her eyes, blurring the already indistinct outline of the small fishing village nestled below. The wind, an angry beast clawing at her, whipped her dark hair across her face, carrying with it the scent of brine and something else – a metallic tang that pricked at her nostrils like a warning. 


Amelia Harper was no stranger to danger.  She’d seen more than her fair share in her years on the force, patrolling the rugged coastline of Islehaven. But tonight felt different. The air crackled with an unseen tension, a sense of impending doom that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. 

The faint glow of the emergency lights from the village below cast long, distorted shadows that danced and writhed in the wind like tormented spirits. It was a scene straight out of a nightmare, amplified by the constant roar of the waves crashing against the unforgiving rocks below.  


Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself against the biting wind. A body had been found washed ashore just moments ago, and something about this case felt deeply unsettling. This wasn't just another drowning; there was a darkness here, a whisper of something sinister lurking in the shadows.
