The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Rose's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of discounted candy bars and dusty toiletries. She fidgeted with her name tag, the plastic edges digging into her already irritated skin. The air in Save-A-Lot was thick with the smell of stale coffee and forgotten dreams. 

It was 3:17 PM on a Tuesday, meaning peak rush hour for those brave souls who sought solace (or at least a discount) in this purgatory of bargain bin finds. Amy had been working the register for three years now, clocking hours that blurred into one long, monotonous symphony of beeps and swipes. Today was no different. 


Customers shuffled through the aisles, their carts laden with questionable brand-name cereals and frozen dinners past their prime.  A few paused by her register, their faces etched with a mixture of boredom and resignation. Amy knew their stories without them having to say a word. They were just like her: stuck in a rut, waiting for something – anything – to change.
