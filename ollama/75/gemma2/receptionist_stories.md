The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of identical cubicles. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. 

Amelia tapped her manicured nails against the glossy surface of her desk, the rhythmic clicking echoing in the unnervingly silent office. She was the receptionist at "Solutions Inc.", a consultancy firm that promised to solve all your problems, which seemed ironic considering their employees appeared perpetually frazzled. It wasn't exactly glamorous. But Amelia had learned long ago to find solace in routine, in the predictability of ringing phones and barking orders from her boss, Mr. Worthington, whose temper was as volatile as his hair product. 


The glass doors to the reception area slid open with a hiss, shattering the stillness. A woman, dressed head-to-toe in black, stepped inside, her face obscured by oversized sunglasses.  Amelia's pulse quickened. This wasn't the usual parade of suits and briefcases. Something about this visitor felt different, dangerous even.
