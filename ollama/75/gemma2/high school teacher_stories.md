The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Ms. Eleanor Thistlewick's classroom. It was the kind of Monday morning that clung to you like stale coffee breath – dreary, uninspired, and promising little change from the previous week.  Eleanor sighed, adjusting her glasses perched precariously on the bridge of her nose. The air hung heavy with the scent of yesterday’s forgotten lunches and teenage angst. A single ray of sunlight pierced through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path – a fleeting reminder of life beyond these four walls. 

Eleanor surveyed the scene: empty desks, scattered crumpled papers, and a lone sock lying forlornly beneath her desk.  Her high school English class was notoriously unruly. She yearned for the days when her students were eager to dissect Shakespearean sonnets instead of dissecting each other during free period. Perhaps, she mused, a good dose of classic literature paired with a sprinkle of caffeine would be enough to spark some interest in this particularly bleak Monday morning.
