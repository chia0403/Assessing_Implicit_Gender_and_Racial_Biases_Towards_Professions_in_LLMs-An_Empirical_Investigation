The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Silas Blackwood's office like a thousand tiny fists, each blow reverberating through his bones.  He sat hunched over a chipped Formica table, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee that tasted more of despair than caffeine. Outside, the streets of New Orleans were awash in a grimy symphony of headlights and overflowing gutters, the air thick with the scent of jasmine and impending doom. 

Silas Blackwood wasn't known for his sunny disposition, but even he felt a chill crawl up his spine as he read the note again: "Find her before it's too late."  The message was scrawled in hurried, shaky handwriting on cheap stationery, devoid of any signature or identifying details. All Silas knew was that 'her' was a woman named Celeste Dubois, and she had vanished without a trace from the notorious Bourbon Street a week ago. 


This wasn't just another missing person case; there was an edge to the note, a desperation that clawed at Silas's gut. He rubbed his tired eyes, the faint scent of stale whiskey clinging to him like a second skin.  

This city, this swamp of sin and secrets, had a way of sucking you in, leaving you drowning in its murky depths.  Silas was more than familiar with that feeling. But something about Celeste Dubois, someone he'd never met, pulled at him like an anchor dragging him towards the abyss.
