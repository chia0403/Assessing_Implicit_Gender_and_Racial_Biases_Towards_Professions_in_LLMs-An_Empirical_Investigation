The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A blanket of fog clung to the forest floor, swallowing the trail beneath Fiona MacAllister's boots. She adjusted her helmet, its orange glow reflecting in the dew-laden grass, and scanned the horizon. The smoke plume rising from the north was a sinister black against the pale dawn sky, a stark reminder of the reason she was here, deep in the heart of Redwood National Park. 

Fiona, known to her crew as "Mac", had been with the CalFire for ten years, battling blazes across California. This one, however, felt different. The whispers amongst seasoned firefighters spoke of an unnatural intensity, a fire that seemed to devour everything in its path with an almost sentient hunger.  


"Stay sharp, Mac," her partner, a grizzled veteran named Jake "Hawkeye" Hanson, said, his voice barely audible above the wind rustling through the towering redwoods. "This one's got teeth."

Mac nodded, her heart pounding against her ribs like a trapped bird. She gripped the axe strapped to her hip, its familiar weight grounding her in this unsettlingly quiet wilderness. This fire wasn't just another blaze; it was a challenge, a test of skill and courage that threatened not only their lives but the ancient heart of the park itself.
