The air hung thick with lavender and chamomile, a scent Amelia "Amy" Rosewell carefully cultivated to calm her clientele's anxieties. Her little practice, tucked away on a quiet street in Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood, was a sanctuary from the city’s frenetic energy. Sunlight streamed through the stained glass window she’d found at a vintage shop, casting rainbows across the plush massage table where a woman named Evelyn lay, face buried in a towel, shoulders tense. Amy's fingers hovered above Evelyn's knotted back muscles, ready to coax her into relaxation. 

But as Amy inhaled deeply, catching a whiff of something metallic beneath the calming herbal notes, she felt a prickle of unease. This wasn’t the usual stress-induced scent that clung to her clients – this was something else entirely. Something… darker.
