The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Everly's head, casting a sterile glow over the stark white walls of the clinic waiting room. She could hear the rhythmic tapping of keys from Dr. Hernandez's office down the hall, punctuated by the occasional cough or sigh from a patient. A half-hearted attempt at ambience – a vase of wilted daisies on the reception desk – did little to soften the antiseptic air. 

Amelia sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Phlebotomy wasn't glamorous, but it was honest work. And sometimes, like now, when she felt the familiar weight of routine settling over her, it offered a comforting sense of predictability. She glanced at the clipboard on her lap, already anticipating the usual parade of patients: Mrs. Rodriguez with the shaky hand, Mr. Jackson who always claimed to faint, and little Timmy whose veins seemed perpetually in hiding. 

Just then, the door swung open and a man walked in. Tall, with piercing blue eyes and a demeanor that could only be described as ‘intense’, he stood out like a misplaced neon sign in this drab room. He didn't glance at the daisy vase or the chipped paint on the wall. His gaze landed directly on Amelia, holding her attention with an unnerving intensity. A shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't just another routine appointment.  Something about him felt…different.
