The air in Silas Montgomery's apartment hummed with the low thrum of his servers, a constant white noise symphony to his ears. The room itself was bathed in the cool blue glow of multiple monitors, each displaying lines of code that twisted and turned like cryptic constellations. Outside his window, the city of Neo-Kyoto pulsed with life – neon signs bled into the twilight sky, holographic advertisements flickered across towering skyscrapers, and a constant stream of automated vehicles zipped through the crowded streets below. 

Silas, however, remained oblivious to the bustling world outside. He hunched over his keyboard, his fingers flying across the keys with practiced ease. His brow furrowed in concentration as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn line of code, a glitch threatening to derail months of painstaking work on his latest project – an AI designed to analyze and predict patterns in human behavior.
