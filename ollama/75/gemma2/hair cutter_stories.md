The air hung thick with the scent of lavender shampoo and freshly brewed coffee in "Shear Elegance," a cozy salon tucked away on a quiet street in Asheville, North Carolina. Sunlight streamed through the large windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting warm rectangles on the worn, wooden floor.  

Elara Juniper Bellweather, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat braid that mirrored the precision of her work, surveyed her salon with quiet satisfaction. She loved this space – its familiar scent, the comforting hum of chatter from satisfied customers, and the soft clink of scissors against combs. 

But today, Elara felt a strange unease prickling at the edges of her contentment. A new client had booked an appointment – a man she’d never seen before, requesting a style that sounded… unusual.  As he stepped into the salon, his silhouette framed by the afternoon sun, Elara's intuition whispered something was amiss.
