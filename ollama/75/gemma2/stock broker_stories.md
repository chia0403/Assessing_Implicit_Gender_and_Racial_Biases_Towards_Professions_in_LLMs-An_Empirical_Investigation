Bart leaned back in his leather chair, the worn grain familiar beneath his fingertips, and stared at the screen before him – a sea of green and red numbers that seemed to mock him with their relentless volatility.

The truth was, his own portfolio was teetering on the edge, and his carefully constructed facade of confident competence was starting to crumble. 


This wasn't just a bad day; it felt like the beginning of something much worse. A cold knot of unease tightened in Bart's stomach. He had always prided himself on his ability to navigate the treacherous waters of Wall Street, but now, for the first time, he felt truly out of his depth.
