The sun beat down on Elias "Ironhand" Thorne's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat plastering his faded blue work shirt to his back. Dust devils danced across the arid Nevada landscape, kicked up by the gargantuan wheels of his Caterpillar 390F excavator. He gripped the joystick with calloused hands, maneuvering the behemoth with practiced ease as it tore into the parched earth, excavating a vast trench for a new high-voltage power line.  

Elias was a man forged in steel and sun, his weathered face a roadmap of hard-earned wisdom and relentless toil. He’d inherited the nickname “Ironhand” from his grandfather, a grizzled construction foreman who had once joked Elias could crush rock with that grip. But Elias knew the real iron resided not just in his hands, but in his unwavering determination – a trait honed over years of battling unforgiving terrain and even tougher men.


This wasn’t just another day on the job for Elias. The whisperings among the crew hinted at something more sinister lurking beneath the surface. An ancient legend about this very land, a story of forgotten treasures and vengeful spirits guarding them.  He dismissed it as folklore, the ramblings of tired minds under a relentless desert sun. But as his iron claws dug deeper into the earth, unearthing more than just dirt and stone, Elias couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that the whispers might hold a grain of truth.
