Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Pelican, a dive bar nestled in the heart of New Orleans’ French Quarter. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation, punctuated by the occasional clang of glasses and the mournful wail of a bluesman on stage. At a corner table, nursing a lukewarm whiskey, sat Amelia “Amy” Celeste Dubois, notepad clutched in her hand, her sharp blue eyes scanning the room.  

Amy, a reporter for The Louisiana Gazette, had been chasing leads on a story about the mysterious disappearance of local jazz legend, Antoine "Fingers" Dupree, for weeks.  The police were dragging their feet, dismissing it as a case of a restless old man wandering off. But Amy knew better. There was something rotten in New Orleans’ vibrant but shadowed underbelly, and Fingers' vanishing felt like just the tip of the iceberg.


She took another sip of her whiskey, the burn momentarily chasing away the chill that settled deep in her bones. Tonight, however, she wasn't searching for clues.  Tonight, Amy was on a mission to find someone who could lead her to them.
