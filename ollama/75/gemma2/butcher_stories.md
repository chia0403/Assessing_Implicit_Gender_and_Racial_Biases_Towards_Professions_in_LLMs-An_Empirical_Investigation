The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and rosemary in Bartholomew "Barty" Grimble's shop. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, casting long shadows across the rows of glistening sausages hanging like plump ornaments from hooks. Barty, his weathered hands stained crimson, stood behind the counter, meticulously trimming fat from a slab of pork belly. 

His butcher shop, tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of  Grimhaven, was more than just a place to buy meat; it was a repository of stories, whispers passed down through generations, carried on the wind whistling through the gaps in the ancient wooden walls. Barty knew them all, from the tale of the cursed mutton that caused uncontrollable laughter to the legend of the butcher who could predict the future by reading the lines on a cow’s hide.  He lived amongst these stories, as much a part of their fabric as the worn leather apron he always wore and the sharp glint in his eye. 

Today, however, something felt different. A chill settled over the shop, deeper than the usual bite of the autumn wind. Barty couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to change, something big, something… bloody.
