The air hung thick with humidity and the smell of frying onions, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Grace Prescott like a second skin as she walked down Maple Street.  Heat radiated from the asphalt, warping the midday sun into shimmering mirages. She tugged at her collar, wishing for the crisp autumn air back home in Vermont. Here, in the humid, bustling heart of New Orleans, even the cicadas seemed to whine with exhaustion. 

Amy had been assigned to this district for just six months, and already she felt like a stranger in a foreign land. The vibrant music spilling from open doorways, the scent of beignets hanging heavy on the breeze, the boisterous laughter echoing down the narrow alleys – it was all so different from the quiet, predictable rhythm of her old life. 

She paused outside number 234, a faded shotgun house with chipped paint and overgrown azaleas clinging to its sides like stubborn vines. This was where Jerome "Jethro" Moreau lived, a young man recently released from prison for petty theft. Amy’s job was to ensure he stayed on the straight and narrow. But as she took a deep breath and reached for her badge, she couldn't shake the feeling that this case was going to be more complicated than she had anticipated.
