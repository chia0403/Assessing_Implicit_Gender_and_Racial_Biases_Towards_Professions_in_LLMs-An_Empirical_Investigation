The aroma of sawdust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of drying varnish. Elias Blackwood ran his calloused hand across the smooth surface of the cherrywood table he was crafting, feeling the subtle grain beneath his fingertips. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of his workshop, illuminating motes that danced like tiny fireflies. Outside, the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer echoed from the village square, a familiar soundtrack to Elias's days. 

Elias Blackwood wasn't just any carpenter; he was known throughout Oakhaven for his artistry. His creations weren't mere functional pieces of furniture; they were whispers of beauty, imbued with life through his meticulous hands. He poured his soul into every curve, every joint, every detail. But lately, the joy had faded from his work, replaced by a gnawing emptiness that he couldn't quite place. 


The setting is Oakhaven, a small, quaint village nestled in a valley surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. The year is 1885, a time when horse-drawn carriages still rattled along cobblestone streets and the sound of wind chimes marked the passing hours.
