Outside, the wind whispered through the corn stalks, their dry leaves rustling like hushed secrets. Elias, his calloused hands wrapped around a steaming mug of coffee, surveyed his land from the porch swing.

But this year, a shadow had fallen over his heart, heavier than any winter frost. The drought, relentless and unforgiving, had choked the life out of his fields, leaving behind parched earth and wilting dreams.  


Elias took a long sip of coffee, the bitterness mirroring his mood. He needed a miracle, something to turn the tide before he lost everything.
