The bell above the door to Apothecary & Co. chimed its familiar tune as Amelia Beatrice Lavender peered out from behind the polished mahogany counter. A gust of wind whipped through the open doorway, carrying with it the scent of rain-soaked earth and chimney smoke – a comforting aroma unique to autumn in Willow Creek.  

Amelia adjusted her spectacles, their silver frames glinting under the warm glow of the kerosene lamps that lined the shelves stocked with dusty jars and handwritten labels. She surveyed the cozy interior: worn leather armchairs nestled beside crackling fireplaces, the scent of cinnamon and cloves emanating from a simmering pot on the stove, and rows upon rows of meticulously organized bottles filled with colorful powders and tinctures. 

The familiar tranquility of her apothecary was interrupted by a loud thump followed by a muffled curse from outside. A young man stumbled through the doorway, his face pale and his clothes mud-stained. He shook droplets of water from his tangled hair and coughed, sending a spray of icy air across Amelia's meticulously arranged counter.


This wasn't just another customer seeking relief for a common cold or a remedy for insomnia. This was something different.  Something that sent a shiver down Amelia's spine – the kind of chill that only came with knowing a storm was brewing, both literally and figuratively.
