The air in Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty blinds, casting long shadows across her cluttered desk. Paperclips clinked like tiny wind chimes against her overflowing inbox, each one a silent testament to another day spent navigating the treacherous waters of insurance claims. Amelia rubbed her temples, willing away the throbbing headache that threatened to consume her.  

Her current client, Mr. Bartholomew Grummett, sat across from her, his face a mask of anxiety. He was sweating profusely, clutching a tattered photograph of a seemingly ordinary garden gnome. "It's insured for... well, it's worth a fortune, Mrs. Hawthorne," he stammered, his voice wavering. "Stolen right out of my meticulously manicured rose bushes! The police say it's just a silly ornament, but this, this is Bartholomew the Brave! He holds sentimental value… and I’ve proof!"

Amelia sighed. This wasn't her first rodeo with eccentric clients and outrageous claims. But something about Mr. Grummett's fervent pleas, his trembling hand gripping the photograph of a gnome with alarmingly lifelike eyes, made her pause.  


The setting is Amelia’s small insurance agency in a quiet suburban town, somewhere between bustling city life and sleepy rural charm. It's a place where gossip travels faster than news reports and everyone seems to know each other's business.
