The rhythmic buzz of clippers filled the air, punctuated by the occasional click-clack of shears against metal. Hairspray hung heavy in the atmosphere, mingling with the scent of jasmine shampoo and a faint hint of desperation. 

Emilia "Em" Rosewater surveyed her domain - The Polished Peacock, a quaint salon tucked between a bustling Thai restaurant and a forlorn laundromat on Elm Street.  Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the lace curtains, illuminating the chipped porcelain sink and the faded floral wallpaper that desperately tried to hold onto its elegance.

The usual hum of chatter from clients was absent, replaced by an eerie silence. It had been three weeks since the pandemic-induced shutdown, and Em's once thriving business felt like a ghost ship adrift in a sea of uncertainty.
