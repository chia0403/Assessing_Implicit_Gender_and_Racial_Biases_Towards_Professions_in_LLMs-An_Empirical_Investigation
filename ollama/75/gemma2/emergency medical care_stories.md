Emergency lights flickered like dying stars in the downpour, casting grotesque shadows across the slick asphalt. Inside the ambulance, Amelia "Amy" Grace Evans grimaced as the siren wailed its mournful cry, a soundtrack to their frantic journey.  She double-checked her equipment – stethoscope hanging neatly around her neck, vials of medication within reach, gloves and mask at the ready – her gaze fixed on the patient slumped in the back.

A sense of foreboding clung to her like the dampness of the city air. As they hurtled towards their destination, she couldn't shake the feeling that this case, this unknown patient, held something more than just another medical emergency.
