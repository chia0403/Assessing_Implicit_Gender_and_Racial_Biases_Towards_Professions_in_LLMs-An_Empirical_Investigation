The air hung thick with the scent of stale diesel and burnt coffee, a familiar perfume to Jeremiah "Ace" Hawthorne.  His rig, a chrome-plated Kenworth named 'Old Reliable', rumbled softly as it sat idling at the Love's Truck Stop in Amarillo, Texas. The neon sign buzzed like a tired cicada, casting an electric glow on Ace's weathered face and grease-stained hands. Outside, the desert wind whipped around him, carrying whispers of distant thunderstorms and the low hum of 18-wheelers settling for the night.  Ace leaned back in his driver's seat, the worn leather creaking in protest. He needed a break, but not from driving. He needed a break from thinking. This haul was supposed to be simple: Dallas to Amarillo, pick up a load of cattle feed and head east. But something about it felt off, like a bad taste lingering on his tongue.  The dispatcher had been unusually vague about the details, and there was a new urgency in his voice that Ace couldn't shake off. 


He rubbed a tired hand over his jaw, thinking back to the way the dispatcher had looked at him, eyes narrowed just a fraction too much, lips pressed together in a thin line.  Ace knew better than most that sometimes, on these lonely stretches of asphalt, the silence held more secrets than the words themselves.
