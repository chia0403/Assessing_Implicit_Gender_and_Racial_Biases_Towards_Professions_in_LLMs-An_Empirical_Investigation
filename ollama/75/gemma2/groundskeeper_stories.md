The humid Georgia air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Evergreen like a second skin as he pushed the rusty mower across the emerald expanse of Willow Creek Cemetery. Dewdrops, plump and glistening, hung like jewels on the blades of grass, catching the first rays of the dawn sun and throwing tiny rainbows onto the weathered headstones. Bart's calloused hands gripped the handles, his muscles aching from yesterday's pruning session.  

He inhaled deeply, the scent of damp earth and magnolia blossoms filling his lungs. It was a familiar comfort, this symphony of smells and sounds that accompanied him every morning in the hallowed grounds he tended with unwavering devotion. To Bart, Willow Creek wasn't just a place of death; it was a living tapestry woven with memories, whispered stories, and enduring love, each blade of grass and blooming rose a testament to lives lived and legacies left behind. 


Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced across his skin as he surveyed the familiar landscape. A patch of recently disturbed earth near the old willow tree, its branches drooping with age like weeping mourners, caught his eye. It was out of place amongst the neat rows of graves and meticulously manicured pathways. 


Bart straightened, a knot forming in his stomach. He wasn't one for superstition, but a feeling, as sure and constant as the rising sun, told him this disruption held a story yet to be told.
