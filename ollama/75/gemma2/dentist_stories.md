The rhythmic whirring of the drill was almost drowned out by the insistent drumming of rain against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Price’s dental practice. Outside, the world was grey and sullen, mirroring the mood that had settled over Evelyn since her grandmother passed away last week. The little floral shop across the street, once a vibrant splash of colour in the otherwise drab strip mall, was now draped in black crepe, its cheerful window displays replaced by mournful condolences.

Evelyn’s practice, nestled between a dry cleaner and a boarded-up video rental store, felt even more desolate than usual. She missed her grandmother’s visits, usually filled with gossip about the neighbourhood and freshly baked scones that always smelled like cinnamon and sunshine.  Now, the silence was heavy, punctuated only by the occasional groan of the old building settling beneath its own weight.

She sighed, wiping a stray bead of water from the countertop. Her first appointment was in ten minutes, a young boy named Michael who needed a filling. She took a deep breath, trying to shake off the melancholy that clung to her like cobwebs. It was time to focus on her patients, one drill at a time.
