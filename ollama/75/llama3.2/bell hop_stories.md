Here's a potential story opening:

The neon sign above the diner creaked and swayed in the gentle breeze, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted streets of Las Vegas. The city was alive at night, but in this small corner of the Strip, the only sound was the soft hum of the diner's jukebox and the distant thrum of the slot machines.

 Inside, the neon lights reflected off the polished chrome of the diner's interior, creating a dizzying display of color and light. Behind the counter, waitress Dixie LaRue polished a mug with a dirty rag, her eyes fixed on the door as she waited for her next customer.

In the corner, near the door that led to the alleyway, a young man named Maximilian "Max" Thompson sat hunched over a stack of luggage, his bright blue eyes fixed intently on a worn leather suitcase. Max was a bellhop at the Golden Nugget, and he'd been working non-stop for days, ever since his boss had told him that a mysterious guest was arriving tonight.

As Max double-checked the address on the suitcase, a faint hum filled the air - the sound of an old-fashioned key turning in a lock. The diner's door creaked open, and a figure slipped inside, their face obscured by shadows.
