Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the deserted streets. In a small trailer park on the outskirts of town, Highway Worker Elliot Theodore Jackson stirred from his creaky bunk bed, rubbing the sleep from his eyes. His worn denim jeans and faded trucker hat seemed out of place among the tidy surroundings, but they were all he had. The faint scent of diesel fuel and motor oil wafted through the air, a constant reminder of his day job on the nearby highway.

As Elliot swung his legs over the side of the bed, his eyes landed on the small photograph taped to the wall above his bunk – a picture of his late father, a fellow highway worker who had passed away just six months ago. The memory still felt raw and painful, but it was one Elliot couldn't shake. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of restlessness that always seemed to follow him back home.

"Time to get moving," he muttered to himself, already knowing what lay ahead – another long day on the highway, fixing potholes and patching up accidents. But today was different. Today, Elliot had received a mysterious phone call from an unknown number, with only one phrase hanging in the air: "Meet me at the old windmill on Highway 12 at midnight. Come alone."

Elliot's heart skipped a beat as he wondered what could be behind this cryptic message. Was it something to do with his father's death? Or was it just another prank from some bored teenager? Whatever it was, Elliot had a feeling that tonight was going to change everything.
