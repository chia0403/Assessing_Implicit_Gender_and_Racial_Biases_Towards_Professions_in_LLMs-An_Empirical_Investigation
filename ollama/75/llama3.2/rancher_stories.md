Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Ranch, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and scrubby desert brush that stretched as far as the eye could see. The air was thick with the scent of sagebrush and mesquite, and the sky was ablaze with hues of pink and purple.

At the heart of this rugged landscape stood the ranch itself, a sprawling complex of weathered adobe buildings and rusty corrals, surrounded by acres of dry land that had been in Elijah Jace Warner's family for generations. Elijah, or "Jace" as he preferred to be called, was a fourth-generation rancher, with a deep-seated love for the land and its rhythms.

As he rode his horse, Cimarron, out across the range, Jace felt a sense of contentment wash over him. The day had been long and hot, but the cool breeze off the surrounding hills had brought some much-needed relief from the desert heat. He was making his way to the north pasture, where he would check on the herd's grazing patterns and make any necessary adjustments to their feeding schedule.

As he crested a small rise, Jace spotted something that made his heart skip a beat: a plume of dust rising from the old homestead site down by the creek. It was a sign, unmistakable in its simplicity - someone had come to the ranch, and it wasn't just the usual travelers passing through on their way to or from town.

Jace's instincts told him that something was off. He reined Cimarron in and gazed out at the landscape, his eyes scanning for any sign of movement or surveillance. But there was nothing - just the desert, stretching out as far as the eye could see. And yet, he knew that he had to investigate.
