It was a typical Scottish autumn evening, with the smell of damp earth and woodsmoke wafting from the nearby pubs and restaurants.

At 32, Rory was one of the most respected and sought-after editors in Edinburgh's literary scene. Her sharp eye for detail and quick wit had earned her the nickname "The Grammarian" among writers and publishers alike.
