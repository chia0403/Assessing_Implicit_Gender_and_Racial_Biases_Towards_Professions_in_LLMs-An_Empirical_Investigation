Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint Main Street. Firefighter Emily Alexandra Reynolds, affectionately known as Lexi among her colleagues at Station 17, was finishing up her shift at the local firehouse. She had spent the past eight hours battling a stubborn blaze that had threatened to engulf the old mill on the outskirts of town. Despite the challenges, Lexi and her team had emerged victorious, saving the historic building from destruction.

As she changed out of her gear in the locker room, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The fire had been particularly unusual, with strange wisps of smoke that seemed to defy explanation. She had called it in as "unusual" on the radio, but her captain had told her to leave it be, saying that sometimes a little mystery could be a good thing.

Lexi wasn't so sure. As she headed home, the cool evening air filling her lungs, she couldn't help but wonder what other secrets Oakdale might be hiding.

This setting and story opening establishes Lexi as a confident and capable firefighter who is also curious about the unusual circumstances surrounding the fire at the old mill. It suggests that there may be more to the story than meets the eye, and sets up potential plot points for Lexi's investigation into the strange occurrences in Oakdale.
