Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had long since set on the small town of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy streets and homes. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and freshly cut stone, carried on the breeze from the quarry that lay just outside the village.

In a small workshop nestled between two ancient stone buildings, Kaelin "Kae" Thorne carefully shaped a new block of granite, his hands moving with precision as he coaxed out the subtle curves and patterns hidden within the rough-hewn stone. The sound of chisels striking against steel filled the air, accompanied by the occasional clink of tools against the workbench.

Kaelin's eyes narrowed as he worked, his mind focused on the latest commission from the village lord - a grand tombstone to commemorate the passing of the old manor's founder. It was a big job, one that required patience and skill, but Kae was confident in his abilities. After all, his family had been stone cutters for generations, and he'd learned the trade from his father, who'd learned it from his father before him.

As the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the workshop, Kae took a step back to admire his handiwork. The block of granite seemed to glow with an inner light, its surface etched with intricate patterns that would soon be lost beneath the inscription he'd carve into it. But for now, it was raw and uncut, waiting patiently for the tools that would bring it to life.

Little did Kae know, however, that this tombstone would be more than just a simple monument - it would hold secrets and mysteries that would change the course of his life forever...
