Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had long since set on the small coastal town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint harbor where Captain Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson III had just landed her sleek, black Cessna 421 Golden Eagle. Lexi, a seasoned pilot with thousands of hours under her belt, gazed out at the water as she shut down the engine and stepped out onto the tarmac.

Ravenswood was a sleepy fishing village nestled between rugged cliffs and the vast expanse of the Pacific Ocean. The air was crisp and salty, filled with the scent of seaweed and the distant tang of diesel fuel from the docked boats. Lexi felt a sense of peace wash over her as she breathed in the familiar scents of home.

As she stretched her arms and arched her back, Lexi's eyes scanned the dock, searching for any signs of trouble or excitement. Her husband, Jack, was already waiting for her on the dock, a tall, lanky man with a quick smile and a way of making her feel like the only person in the world.

"Hey, kiddo," he said, as Lexi walked towards him, her eyes sparkling with fatigue. "How's your flight?"

Lexi smiled, feeling a sense of satisfaction wash over her. "It was a good one," she said. "Just the usual cargo runs and scenic flights. The usual."

Jack nodded, his expression serious. "I heard there's been some activity in the area," he said, his voice low. "Some of the fishermen have reported strange sightings out on the water. Whales, maybe?"

Lexi raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. "That sounds like a myth to me," she said, but Jack just shook his head.

"I'm telling you, Lexi, I've heard some weird stories about this place," he said. "Some folks are talking about old shipwrecks and lost treasure."

Lexi's eyes narrowed, her mind already racing with possibilities. She had always loved the sea, and the idea of uncovering its secrets was a tantalizing one.

"I think we should take a look," she said, a spark of excitement igniting within her.

And with that, Lexi Thompson III stepped off into the unknown, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
