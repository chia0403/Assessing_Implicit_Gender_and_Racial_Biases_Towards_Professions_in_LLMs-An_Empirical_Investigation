The fog rolled in off the coast of Ravenshire, shrouding the narrow streets and alleys of the old town in a damp, grey mist. It was the kind of morning that made you want to stay indoors, wrap a hot cup of tea around your hands, and forget about the world outside.

In a small shop on Raven's Lane, nestled between a crumbling church and a haberdasher's store, The Cutting Edge stood like a beacon of warmth and comfort. Here, Amidst Jethro Fletcher - a stout, jovial butcher with arms as thick as his temper and a heart of gold - got to work, expertly crafting the day's offerings from the finest cuts of meat in the region.

Amidst had inherited The Cutting Edge from his father, who had learned the trade from his own father before him. It was a tradition that went back generations, one that Amidst took great pride in preserving and passing on to his own apprentices. On this particular morning, however, Amidst's thoughts were elsewhere - consumed by the mysterious package that had arrived at the shop earlier that night, its contents sending a shiver down his spine and making him wonder if this was going to be the day that The Cutting Edge would get more than just a new supply of sausages.
