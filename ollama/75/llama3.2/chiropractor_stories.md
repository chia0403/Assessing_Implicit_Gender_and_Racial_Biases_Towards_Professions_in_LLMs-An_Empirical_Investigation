Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a chiropractor as the main character:

The fog rolled in off the Pacific Ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Crescent Bay in a damp, gray mist. It was a chill that ran deep into Dr. Elijah "Eli" Thompson-Peters' bones, a familiar sensation that only added to his growing unease.

As he stepped out of his office, Eli gazed up at the towering cedars and spruces that lined the streets, their branches etched against the gray sky like skeletal fingers. He took a deep breath, trying to shake off the feeling of disquiet that had been building all morning. It was a sense of restlessness he'd grown accustomed to in recent months, ever since his wife, Rachel, had left him without warning.

Eli adjusted his glasses and checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time. He still had an hour before his first patient of the day, and he needed that extra time to collect his thoughts. As a chiropractor, he was used to helping people align their bodies with the universe – but lately, it seemed like everything in his life was out of alignment.

With a sigh, Eli began his walk home, his feet carrying him along the familiar streets as if on autopilot. He knew every nook and cranny of Crescent Bay, from the quirky shops on Main Street to the crumbling pier that jutted out into the ocean like a fossilized claw. But even as he walked, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off – that the very fabric of his life was about to be torn apart once again.
