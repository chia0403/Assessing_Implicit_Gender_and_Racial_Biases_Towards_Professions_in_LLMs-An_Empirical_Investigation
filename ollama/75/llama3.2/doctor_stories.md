Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alessandro "Alex" Bianchi stood at the edge of the small hospital balcony, gazing out over the storm-tossed waters of the Mediterranean. The salty spray mingled with the scent of wet earth and decaying leaves, a smell that always brought back memories of his childhood summers spent in this coastal town. As he took a deep breath, the city's cacophony - the wail of sirens, the rumble of engines, the shouts of pedestrians - receded into the background, replaced by the soothing crash of waves against the shore.

The storm had rolled in suddenly, as if the sea itself was responding to some primal call. The hospital's emergency room was already feeling the strain, with calls pouring in from all over the city. As a ER doctor, Alex was no stranger to chaos, but he'd always preferred the stillness of this early morning moment before the mayhem began.

As he turned back towards the balcony's railing, his eyes caught on the small plaque etched into the stone below - "Donazione di Angelo Bianchi". It was a family tradition, one that Alex had grown up hearing stories about from his grandparents. His great-grandfather, Angelo Bianchi, had been a shipwrecked sailor who'd made it to shore after weeks at sea, only to die shortly thereafter of pneumonia and broken bones.

Alex shivered, despite the warmth of the dawn, feeling an inexplicable sense of foreboding wash over him. He wasn't sure what the day would bring, but he was ready for whatever came his way - whether it was a life-or-death emergency or just another grueling 12-hour shift at the hospital.

Little did Alex know, this stormy morning was about to become just that - and so much more.
