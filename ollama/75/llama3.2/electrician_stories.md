Here's a potential story opening:

---

The sun had long since set on the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In the midst of this peaceful evening, the phone at 145 Maple Street began to ring, shrill and insistent. Inside the cozy bungalow, electrician and owner of Oakdale Electrical Services, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, wiped her hands on a dirty rag and made her way to the kitchen to answer it.

As she lifted the receiver to her ear, Lexi's mind wandered back to her own family - her husband, Jake, and their two rambunctious kids, Max and Luna. She had promised them a special dinner at home tonight, but the phone call was quickly putting those plans on hold.

"Lexi's Electrical Services," she said firmly, trying to sound more professional than she felt. The voice on the other end of the line was unfamiliar, and Lexi's instincts immediately went on high alert.

"Hello? This is Lexi," she repeated, her eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble - perhaps a stray wire or an exposed socket that needed attention.

There was a pause on the other end of the line, followed by a hesitant voice. "Lexi Thompson? I need to speak with you about your services."

Lexi's grip on the receiver tightened as her mind began to spin possibilities - was it a new client seeking her expertise? Or something more sinister?

"Of course," she said smoothly, trying to reassure the caller that everything would be fine. But deep down, Lexi knew better. She had a feeling about this call.

"Hello again?" the voice repeated, growing slightly more urgent. "My name is... Dr. Everett. And I think you're going to find what I have to say very interesting."

Lexi's eyes narrowed as she tried to place the surname - but before she could respond, the line went dead, leaving her staring at a blank receiver and wondering what she had just gotten herself into.
