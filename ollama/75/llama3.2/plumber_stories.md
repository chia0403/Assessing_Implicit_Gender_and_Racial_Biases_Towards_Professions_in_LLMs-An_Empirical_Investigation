Here's a potential story opening:

The misty dawn air clung to the streets of Ashwood like a damp shroud, casting a gloomy veil over the sleepy town. In a small, cramped workshop nestled between a vintage bookstore and a rundown café, Ember Stonebrook stirred the embers of last night's fire, coaxing them back to life as he prepared for another long day of fixing leaky faucets and unclogging drains. As a plumber with a penchant for getting his hands dirty and a knack for solving mysteries, Ember had grown accustomed to the seedy underbelly of Ashwood's hidden world – but on this particular morning, something felt off.

The streets were eerily quiet, the only sound being the distant hum of the town's water treatment plant and the soft creaking of ancient wooden signs swaying in the wind. Ember's gut tightened as he gazed out into the mist-shrouded dawn, his mind racing with possibilities. It was going to be one of those days.
