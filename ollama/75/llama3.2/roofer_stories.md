Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of freshly cut grass and the distant tang of cedar shingles. On the outskirts of town, on a small plot of land surrounded by tall trees and a rusty old fence, stood the modest home of Avery Wilder Jackson, a 35-year-old roofer with a passion for fixing leaks and installing new roofs.

Avery, nicknamed "Ace" by his friends and family, had spent his entire life learning the trade from his father, who had taught him everything he knew. He took pride in his work, whether it was patching up a missing shingle or installing a brand-new roof from scratch. But despite his love for the job, Avery couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. His father's health had been declining for months, and Avery worried about what would happen to him when he passed away.

As he made his way home from work, the sound of gravel crunching beneath his boots filled the evening air. The roofers' van, emblazoned with the company name "Jackson Roofing," rattled along behind him, carrying a load of new shingles and a promise of hard work to come. Avery's eyes scanned the horizon, searching for any signs of trouble - but all he saw was the peaceful beauty of his hometown, bathed in the golden light of sunset.

Little did Avery know, this was just the beginning of a summer that would change everything...
