Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

The sun was just starting to rise over the small farm town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and fields of golden wheat that stretched as far as the eye could see. It was April 15th, and the air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and the distant rumble of the nearby river.

On his farm, nestled between two great oak trees and a rusty old barn, Emrys Felix Thistlewaite was already up and about, tending to his daily chores. As he stirred the embers of last night's fire into a warm glow, he sipped from his tin cup of strong black tea, watching as the mist rose off the dew-kissed fields like a veil of mystery.

Emrys, or Emrys to those who knew him best - his wife, Rachel, and their children, Jasper and Lily - was a farmer through and through. He'd taken over the family farm from his father, who had inherited it from his own father before him. The land had been in the Thistlewaite family for generations, and Emrys took great pride in carrying on that tradition.

But as he went about his chores, Emrys couldn't shake the feeling of unease that had been growing inside him all week. Something was off, something that made him feel like a storm was brewing on the horizon. He just didn't know what it was yet.
