Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Finch's office, mimicking the storm brewing within her. The file on her desk, starkly illuminated by the single lamp casting a pale yellow circle on the wood, held the details of yet another grisly murder.

Evelyn sighed, tracing the jagged edges of the victim’s autopsy photos with her fingertip. This wasn't just any case; it was eerily similar to three others that had plagued the city over the past six months. Each victim, seemingly chosen at random, brutally murdered and posed in a macabre tableau. The press dubbed them "The Artist's" victims, due to the unsettlingly deliberate nature of their placement.

Evelyn’s expertise lay not in catching criminals but understanding them. She delved into the darkest recesses of the human psyche, seeking the motivations, the triggers, the fractured logic that drove individuals to commit unspeakable acts. But this case was different. The sheer methodical cruelty of "The Artist" chilled her to the bone. It was as if he were deliberately taunting them, playing a macabre game with the police and the city itself. 


Her phone buzzed on the desk, startling her. It was Detective Miller, his gruff voice echoing through the speaker. “Dr. Finch,” he said, "we need you down at the scene. Another one." Evelyn felt a knot tighten in her stomach.

The rain outside intensified, mirroring the growing unease within her. She knew this wasn’t just another case; it was a descent into darkness, and she feared she might not find her way back.
