The sun beat down on Theodore "Teddy" Beaumont's neck, sweat stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a recalcitrant traffic cone. The Arizona desert stretched out around him, shimmering waves of heat radiating off the asphalt and turning the distant mountains into hazy mirages. A lone hawk circled overhead, its sharp cry echoing Teddy's growing frustration. 

He was supposed to be setting up the detour signs for the upcoming roadwork, but this damn cone refused to stay upright.  With a grunt, Teddy jammed it further into the cracked pavement, praying it wouldn't topple over the moment the first truck rumbled by. He glanced at his watch â€“ 7:42 am. Only another eight hours of battling cones, dodging impatient drivers, and inhaling dust before he could clock out and head home to his double-wide trailer and a cold beer.

But today felt different. A strange prickling sensation ran down Teddy's spine, the feeling that something was off. Maybe it was the unnatural stillness of the air, or the unnerving silence from the usually bustling highway. Whatever it was, Teddy couldn't shake the sense that he was being watched, scrutinized by unseen eyes hidden in the shimmering heat haze.
