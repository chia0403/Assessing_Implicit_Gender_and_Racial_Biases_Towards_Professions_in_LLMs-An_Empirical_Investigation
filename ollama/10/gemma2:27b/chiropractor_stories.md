Rain hammered against the frosted glass of Eleanor Vance's chiropractic office window, blurring the already bleak cityscape outside. The steady drumming mirrored the anxiety thrumming in her chest.  It was Tuesday, which meant the monthly meeting with Dr. Ramirez, her landlord and the owner of the entire building. He was a notoriously difficult man to please, constantly sniffing around for reasons to raise her rent. 

Eleanor nervously adjusted the spine model on her desk, its plastic vertebrae gleaming under the fluorescent lights.  She'd poured her heart and soul into this practice, "Balanced Bodies," painstakingly crafting a welcoming space with calming earth tones and soothing music. But despite glowing online reviews and steadily growing clientele, Eleanor always felt teetering on the edge of financial stability. The looming meeting with Dr. Ramirez only amplified that precarious feeling.

Today, however, she had something to offer him: a plan. A bold, unconventional one.  Eleanor hoped it would be enough to sway the formidable doctor, but fear gnawed at her confidence.
