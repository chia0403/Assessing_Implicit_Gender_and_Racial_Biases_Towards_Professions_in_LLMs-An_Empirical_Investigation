The insistent buzz of Beatrice "Bea" Ainsworth's phone vibrated against her chest as she navigated through the throngs of people at the annual Design District Gala. The air shimmered with champagne wishes and caviar dreams, but Bea felt more like she was wading through lukewarm bathwater. Another missed call from Mrs. Hathaway.

The sprawling art deco ballroom pulsed with a frenetic energy. Gleaming chandeliers cast shimmering reflections on polished marble floors while waiters weaved through the crowd, balancing trays laden with hors d'oeuvres. Bea, clad in a simple black sheath dress and her signature crimson lipstick, felt hopelessly out of place amongst the flamboyant designers and socialites.

She longed for the cool refuge of her studio â€“ a haven of muted colours, reclaimed wood furniture, and the comforting scent of paint thinner. Here, surrounded by swatches and sketches, she could truly breathe. Tonight, however, Bea was trapped in a gilded cage, forced to network and schmooze with people who cared more about brand names than Bauhaus principles.

Just as she contemplated making her escape, a voice sliced through the chattering crowd. "Beatrice Ainsworth? I presume?"
