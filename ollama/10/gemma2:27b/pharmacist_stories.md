Rain lashed against the windowpane of "Pill & Remedy," blurring the neon sign's glow into an impressionistic smear. Eleanor Finch sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she watched the storm rage outside. The quaint pharmacy in the heart of Oakhaven was usually bustling at this hour, filled with the comforting aroma of old books and herbal tinctures, but tonight it felt eerily silent.

Eleanor, with her sharp hazel eyes and a calming presence honed by years of listening to people's worries, was used to the late-night rush of coughs, fevers, and forgotten prescriptions. But tonight, even the streetlights outside seemed dimmed by the storm's fury, casting long shadows that danced ominously across the worn wooden floorboards.

A sudden crackle from the loudspeaker jolted Eleanor back to reality. The weather alert blared, warning of a potential tornado touchdown within the hour. Her pulse quickened. She glanced at the clock â€“ 9:47 pm. Closing time was in thirteen minutes. Should she lock up and head home? Or wait for the last stragglers who might need her help before the storm hit?
