The Grand Blackwood Hotel loomed over Alistair Finch like a gothic behemoth. Its gargoyles leered from the roofline, their granite faces twisted in perpetual grimaces, mirroring Alistair’s own mood as he lugged another steamer trunk up the marble steps. The air hung heavy with the scent of old money and beeswax polish, a cloying perfume that never quite masked the underlying whiff of desperation clinging to the faded grandeur of the place.

Alistair, all gangly limbs and perpetually ruffled red hair, navigated the maze of ornate lobbies and echoing hallways with the practiced ease of someone who’d spent half his life within these gilded walls. He knew every creak of the floorboards, every glint of dust motes dancing in the sunbeams slanting through stained-glass windows. But even familiarity couldn't erase the gnawing sense that he was trapped in a gilded cage, destined to forever play the role of the invisible servant amidst the glittering lives of Blackwood’s wealthy patrons.
