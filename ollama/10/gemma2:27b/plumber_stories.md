The acrid smell of chlorine and stale sweat hung heavy in the air, clinging to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins like a second skin. Bart grimaced, wiping his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a smear of grime on his forehead. He was knee-deep in the dank basement of an ancient Victorian house, the pipes groaning and wheezing around him like disgruntled ghosts.  

Rain lashed against the single grimy window above, casting flickering shadows that danced across the cobwebbed walls. The only light came from Bart's headlamp, its beam cutting through the gloom to illuminate a tangle of rusty pipes, leaking joints, and a suspiciously green puddle bubbling ominously in the corner. This was not Bart's favorite kind of job â€“ old houses with plumbing as ancient and temperamental as their occupants tended to be trouble.
