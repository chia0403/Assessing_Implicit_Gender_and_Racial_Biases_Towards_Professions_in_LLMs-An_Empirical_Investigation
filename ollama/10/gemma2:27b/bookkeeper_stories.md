Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Crooked Quill," blurring the neon glow of the liquor store sign across the street. Inside, Elsie Beatrice Finch hunched over her ledger, the faint scent of pipe tobacco and mildew clinging to the air. Stacks of invoices teetered precariously on her desk, threatening to spill onto the already cluttered floor. Elsie chewed on the end of her pencil, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously tallied a string of numbers. 

The "Quill," a dimly lit tavern nestled in the heart of Newhaven's industrial district, was more than just her workplace. It was her sanctuary, a world away from the stifling expectations and relentless gossip of her well-to-do family. Here, amidst the clinking glasses and murmured conversations, Elsie felt truly seen, not for her pedigree or her sharp wit, but for the methodical precision with which she balanced the tavern's accounts.  

But tonight, a sense of unease gnawed at Elsie. The usual boisterous energy of the tavern seemed muted, replaced by an undercurrent of tension. When Mr. Fitzwilliam, the gruff but kind-hearted owner, disappeared into his office without his usual jovial greeting, Elsie couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
