The aroma of burnt garlic clung to the air like a stubborn ghost, refusing to be exorcised by Amelia Hawthorne's frantic fanning.  She surveyed the charred mess in her skillet with a sigh. "Clearly," she muttered to the empty kitchen, "I'm better at advising people on what to eat than actually cooking it."

Amelia lived in a cozy, sun-drenched loft nestled above a bustling bakery in the heart of Greenwich Village. Exposed brick walls and towering windows overlooking a vibrant tapestry of street life lent a bohemian charm to her space. Despite the cheerful surroundings, Amelia felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. Today was the day she was meeting with Mr. Hawthorne - her notoriously difficult-to-please father - for their weekly "catch-up" dinner.

He'd been on her case lately about opening her own practice instead of working as a junior nutritionist at the hospital.  Amelia knew he was right, but the fear of failure held her captive. Tonight, she hoped to muster the courage to share her dreams with him, over burnt garlic bread and whatever else she could salvage from her culinary mishap.
