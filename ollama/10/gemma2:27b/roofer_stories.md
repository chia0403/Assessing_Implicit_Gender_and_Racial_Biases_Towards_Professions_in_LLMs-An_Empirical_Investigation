The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he wrestled another slate tile into place. The old Victorian mansion, with its intricate gables and steep pitch, was proving to be a beast to tame. Its slates were ancient, some cracked and crumbling, others stubbornly refusing to align. Eli swore under his breath, sweat stinging his eyes.

He paused, wiping his brow with the back of his gloved hand, and surveyed the sprawling cityscape below. The rumble of traffic and distant sirens created a discordant symphony that underscored the quiet solitude he found on rooftops. Up here, among the chimneys and gargoyles, Eli felt strangely at peace. He was a man of few words, happiest when his hands were busy, transforming broken things into something whole again.

Today's project, however, wasn't just about fixing a roof. This house held secrets, whispered in the creak of its wooden bones and the shadows that stretched long across its dusty attic windows. Eli had felt it from the moment he stepped onto the overgrown lawn - a sense of unease, a prickling awareness that something wasn't quite right.
