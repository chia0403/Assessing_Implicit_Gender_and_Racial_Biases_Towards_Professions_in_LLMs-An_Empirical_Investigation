The first frost had kissed the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, painting them in a shimmering veil of silver. Theodore "Teddy" Hawthorne, his breath puffing out in miniature clouds, surveyed his domain with a grimace. Autumn's beauty was fleeting, soon to be devoured by winter's relentless grasp. He tugged at the worn collar of his tweed jacket and trudged towards the rose garden, its vibrant blooms now drooping under the weight of frost.

Blackwood Manor, an imposing Victorian mansion perched on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, was Teddy's sanctuary. For twenty years, he had meticulously tended to its gardens, coaxing life from the unforgiving soil and transforming them into havens of color and scent. He knew every twist of each ivy-clad archway, every secret path hidden beneath ancient oaks, every murmuring fountain nestled amidst fragrant blooms. But today, a sense of unease gnawed at him, a discordant note in the familiar symphony of Blackwood's solitude.
