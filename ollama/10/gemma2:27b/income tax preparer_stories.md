Rain hammered against the windowpane of Eleanor Cavendish's office, mimicking the rhythm of her growing anxiety. Tax season was always stressful, but this year felt different. The usual hum of anxieties about deadlines and deductions had been replaced by a chilling dread that settled deep in her gut. It wasn't the complex returns or finicky software updates bothering her; it was a single file sitting ominously on her desk, labeled simply "Estate of Archibald Blackwood." 

Eleanor’s office, tucked away above Mrs. Peabody's bakery on Elm Street, was normally a haven of warmth and organization. The scent of cinnamon and sugar wafted in from downstairs, usually comforting, but today it felt cloying. Stacks of neatly organized tax forms lined the shelves, each representing a life she helped navigate the labyrinthine world of finances. But Archibald Blackwood's file… that one pulsed with an unsettling energy.  

Eleanor stared at the thick envelope, its faded ink hinting at secrets buried within. The deceased was a recluse, rumored to have amassed a considerable fortune through mysterious ventures. His will stipulated Eleanor handle his final accounting, a task that felt increasingly like opening Pandora's box.
