Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her patient. Eleanor, with her silver bobbed hair neatly tucked behind her ears and warm hazel eyes that held an unwavering gaze of empathy, leaned forward in her plush armchair. The scent of lavender from her diffuser mingled with the damp earth smell drifting in from outside, creating a curious tension in the air. 

Across from her sat Liam O'Connell, his broad shoulders hunched and his normally vibrant green eyes clouded with despair.  The worn leather of his jacket squeaked as he shifted uneasily, the weight of his unspoken fears pressing down on him like the relentless rain outside. Eleanor waited patiently, allowing silence to weave its magic, hoping it would coax Liam's secrets into the open.
