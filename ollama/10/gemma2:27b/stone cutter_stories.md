The dust hung heavy in the air, catching the weak morning sunbeams that pierced through the gaps in the rough-hewn wooden roof of Eamon Fitzpatrick's workshop. It swirled and danced, a miniature blizzard of pulverized limestone and granite, settling on the tools laid out meticulously on his workbench – chisels of varying size, a mallet with its worn head polished smooth from years of use, and a plumb bob swinging gently beside the doorway.

Eamon himself was already coated in a fine layer of grey, his calloused hands gripping a chisel as he leaned over a block of pale pink sandstone, carefully chipping away at the excess stone. The rhythmic tapping echoed through the small space, a counterpoint to the distant clangor of blacksmiths and the shouts of vendors from the bustling marketplace just beyond his workshop walls.

He squinted at his work, his brow furrowed in concentration. This piece was destined for the new cathedral being built on the hill overlooking the city – a monument to faith and ambition, its spires already piercing the sky like the talons of a giant bird. Eamon had been entrusted with carving one of the gargoyles that would perch atop the building, their grotesque faces forever staring down upon the city below. 

It was an honor, certainly, but also a heavy responsibility. Every chip and gouge he made was permanent, a testament to his skill – or lack thereof. He couldn't afford to make a mistake. Not with the eyes of the entire city watching.
