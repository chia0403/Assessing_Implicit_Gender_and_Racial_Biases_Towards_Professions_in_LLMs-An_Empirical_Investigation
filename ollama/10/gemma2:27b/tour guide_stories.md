The humid Savannah air clung to Eloise Evangeline Beaumont like a second skin as she ushered her group of tourists towards Forsyth Park's iconic fountain. Spanish moss draped from ancient live oaks, swaying gently in a breeze that carried the faint scent of saltwater and honeysuckle. Eloise, ever the picture of Southern grace in her flowing sundress and wide-brimmed hat, adjusted her microphone. "And here we have the jewel of Savannah," she announced, her voice a melodious drawl, "Forsyth Park Fountain, built in 1858..."

She paused as a sudden commotion erupted near the fountain's base. A young woman, dressed in tattered clothing and with wild eyes, was frantically digging through the planter boxes, muttering something about lost treasures and buried secrets. The tourists gasped and murmured amongst themselves. Eloise, ever calm and composed, took a deep breath. This wasn't the first time she'd encountered Savannah's eccentricities, but this felt different. There was an unsettling urgency in the woman's actions. Eloise knew she had to intervene, not just for the safety of her group but for the sake of the mystery unfolding before them.
