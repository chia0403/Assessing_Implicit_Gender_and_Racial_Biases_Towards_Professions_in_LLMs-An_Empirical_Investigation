Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of the Alexandrina Library, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the ancient panes. Inside, nestled amongst towering shelves laden with centuries' worth of knowledge, sat Beatrice Rosalind Finch, her silver spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose.  The smell of aged paper and leather mingled with the faint scent of lavender polish – Beatrice's signature touch for maintaining the library's comforting aroma.

She was engrossed in cataloguing a recently donated collection of first edition fairy tales when a thunderclap, louder than the rest, shook the building. The lights flickered ominously, then plunged the library into an unsettling darkness. Beatrice sighed, reaching for the oil lamp tucked away on a nearby shelf. As she struck a match, her gaze fell upon the imposing oak door leading to the Restricted Section – a part of the library shrouded in mystery and legend, sealed off for decades.
