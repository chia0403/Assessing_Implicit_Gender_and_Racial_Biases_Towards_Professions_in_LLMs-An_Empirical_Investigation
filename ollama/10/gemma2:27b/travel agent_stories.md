The brass bell above the door jingled merrily as Elias Blackwood, owner and proprietor of Blackwood's Voyages, adjusted his spectacles and peered over them at the woman hesitantly stepping inside. A gust of wind, smelling faintly of rain and salt air, followed her in, swirling dust motes across the antique map that adorned the far wall. Elias smiled warmly, a gesture that crinkled the corners of his eyes like crumpled parchment.

"Welcome to Blackwood's Voyages," he boomed, his voice echoing pleasantly through the shop crammed with travel brochures, dusty globes, and curios from far-flung lands. "How may I assist you in fulfilling your wanderlust today?"


The woman, a young thing barely out of her teens, clutched a battered suitcase to her chest and nervously smoothed down her faded denim skirt. Elias's gaze softened. He recognized the telltale signs of someone yearning for escape, someone who needed the world to open up before them like a well-thumbed atlas.
