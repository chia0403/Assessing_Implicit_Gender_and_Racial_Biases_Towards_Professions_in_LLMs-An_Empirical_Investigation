The desert wind whipped at Silas “Steeljaw” McAlister's weathered face as he wrestled his rig onto the lonely stretch of Route 66. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking the shimmering mirage of a distant waterhole that vanished with every blink. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning Silas’ cab into an oven despite the cracked windows and sputtering air conditioner. He sighed, wiping sweat from his brow with a grimy bandana.  

His 1987 Peterbilt, christened "Betsy" in faded paint on her side, groaned and coughed under the strain of hauling a double load of steel beams across Nevada. Silas had been pushing himself hard lately, trying to make up for lost time after a month-long layoff due to engine trouble. Every mile meant another dollar closer to fixing Betsy's transmission and getting back on his feet.  

He squinted ahead at the endless ribbon of asphalt unfurling before him. This stretch of road was known as "The Devil's Backbone" for its treacherous curves and steep inclines, a challenge Silas relished. He knew every twist and turn like the back of his hand, having traversed it countless times during his 20 years on the road. But today, something felt different. A prickling unease danced along his spine, whispering warnings he couldn't ignore.
