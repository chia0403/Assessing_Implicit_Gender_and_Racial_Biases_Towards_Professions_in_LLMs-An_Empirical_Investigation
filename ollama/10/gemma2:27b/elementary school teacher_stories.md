Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Beatrice Evelyn Cartwright's classroom, mimicking the frantic drumming her fingers made on her desk.  It was the first day back after summer break, and the usual joyful chaos of twenty second-graders had been replaced by a gnawing unease in Beatrice’s stomach. The news, plastered across every screen for weeks, hadn’t helped: whispers of strange occurrences in the woods bordering their small town, tales of flickering lights and unsettling sounds. 

Beatrice’s classroom, usually vibrant with colorful alphabet charts and student artwork, felt strangely muted today. Even the sunbeams peeking through the cloud-laden sky seemed hesitant, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. Outside, the wind howled like a mournful beast, its icy fingers clawing at the old brick building. Beatrice stared out at the swirling grey, her heart heavy with a premonition she couldn't quite explain.
