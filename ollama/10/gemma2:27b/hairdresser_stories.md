The air hung thick with the sweet scent of jasmine and coconut oil, a familiar aroma that always calmed Esmeralda "Esme" Dubois. Outside, the Miami sun beat down relentlessly on Calle Ocho, but inside Esme's salon, "Curls & Confidence," the atmosphere was cool and vibrant. Sunlight streamed through the large storefront window, illuminating the colorful murals depicting Cuban dancers and musicians that adorned the walls.  

Music pulsed from hidden speakers, a mix of salsa and reggaeton that encouraged the rhythmic sway of hips as clients waited their turn. Esme, with her cascading auburn curls piled high in a messy bun, expertly weaved through the salon, greeting regulars by name, offering a comforting touch on the shoulder, or refilling cups of strong Cuban coffee. 

Today, however, an unsettling tension lingered beneath the cheerful facade. A stranger sat in Esme's chair, his back stiff and eyes darting nervously around the room. He clutched a faded photograph in his hand, his knuckles white with anxiety.
