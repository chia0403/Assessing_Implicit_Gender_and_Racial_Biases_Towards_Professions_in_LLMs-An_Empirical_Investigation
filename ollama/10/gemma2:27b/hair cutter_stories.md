The scent of lavender and bergamot hung thick in the air, barely masking the sharp tang of peroxide. It was Wednesday afternoon in "Shear Serenity," Evelyn Cartwright's tiny haven tucked away on a side street bustling with antique shops and quirky cafes. Sunlight streamed through the front window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the towering ferns flanking the entrance. Evelyn, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun, expertly maneuvered a pair of shears, snipping away at the tangled mess framing the face of a young man with anxious eyes. The rhythmic snip-snip was punctuated by the gentle whirring of the hairdryer and the occasional chirp of a sparrow perched on the windowsill outside.  Today felt different, though. A strange energy thrummed beneath the surface of Evelyn's usual calm, a feeling she couldn't quite place.

Maybe it was the new client scheduled for 3 pm - a woman with an enigmatic name and a request for something "drastic". Or perhaps it was simply the oppressive humidity that seemed to cling to everything, making even breathing feel like a chore. Whatever the reason, Evelyn felt a shiver run down her spine as she glanced at the clock ticking away on the wall. 3 pm was just minutes away.
