The air conditioner in Elodie Beaumont's studio apartment wheezed like an asthmatic dragon, struggling to combat the oppressive Miami humidity. Sunlight, relentless and unforgiving, pierced through the blinds, casting harsh stripes across her cluttered desk. Empty coffee cups jostled for space amongst sketches, Pantone swatches, and a half-eaten bowl of guava paste – Elodie's attempt at embracing the local culture.

Elodie sighed, rubbing tired eyes that still stung from last night's all-nighter. A deadline loomed like a menacing shadow: a vibrant new logo for "Sol y Luna," a trendy vegan cafe opening on Ocean Drive. The owner, a charismatic woman named Isabella, had envisioned something bold, something that captured the spirit of Miami – sun, sand, and a touch of Latin flair.  But Elodie's creative well felt bone dry.
