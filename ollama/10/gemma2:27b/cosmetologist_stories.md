The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and lavender as Eloise DeVoe expertly wielded her shears, sculpting layers into Mrs. Henderson's salt-and-pepper bob. Outside, the humid July air pressed against the windowpanes of "Eloise's Elixir," a charming salon nestled in the heart of Savannah's historic district. Sunlight dappled through the Spanish moss draped over the ancient oak tree shading their entrance, casting an ethereal glow on Eloise's auburn braids and freckled shoulders. 

Despite the tranquil ambiance, a knot of tension tightened in Eloise's stomach. A postcard propped against her mirror, its edges softened with wear, bore a single line scrawled in hurried handwriting: "Meet me at the fountain, noon."  No signature. Just that cryptic message and a faded image of the iconic Forsyth Fountain. It was an invitation she couldn't ignore, but one that stirred a cocktail of curiosity and unease within her.
