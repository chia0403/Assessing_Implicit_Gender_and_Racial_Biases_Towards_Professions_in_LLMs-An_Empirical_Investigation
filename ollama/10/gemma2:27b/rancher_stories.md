The sun beat down on Jedediah Blackwood's weathered face as he surveyed his spread. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mocking the withered grass that struggled to cling to life. The wind whistled a lonely tune through the skeletal branches of an ancient cottonwood, its leaves long since surrendered to the relentless drought. 

Jedediah ran a calloused hand over the worn leather brim of his hat, squinting at the horizon where the distant mesas shimmered like mirages. He'd been born on this land, generations of Blackwoods before him carving their lives from the unforgiving earth. But he'd never seen a dry spell this fierce. The creek that snaked through his property was reduced to a trickle, and his cattle were growing gaunt.

Something had to change. Jedediah knew it in his gut. He couldn't let his legacy crumble under the weight of this relentless sun.
