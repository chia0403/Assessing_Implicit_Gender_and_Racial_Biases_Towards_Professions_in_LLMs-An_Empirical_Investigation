Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of Elias Thorne’s shop, blurring the already dim view of cobblestone streets slick with mud. The rhythmic clatter was a familiar lullaby in this cramped corner of Old Town, a soundtrack to Elias's solitary days spent hunched over needle and thread.

Elias, his silver hair pulled back in a tight braid, meticulously traced the outline of a bodice onto heavy velvet, his brow furrowed in concentration. He wasn’t known for his speed – each garment he crafted was a painstaking testament to his skill and artistry. But today, even Elias felt the weight of time pressing down on him. A commission for the Countess Aurelia herself lay unfinished on his workbench, a swirling crimson gown meant to rival the setting sun at her upcoming masquerade ball. 

The clattering ceased abruptly, replaced by a sharp rapping at the door. Elias startled, his needle pricking his calloused thumb. He winced, sucking the blood away before carefully setting down his work and shuffling towards the entrance. Through the frosted glass, he glimpsed a shadowy figure silhouetted against the flickering gaslight outside. A shiver ran down his spine – unexpected visitors were rare in this forgotten part of town. 

He cautiously unlatched the door, bracing himself for whatever lay beyond.
