Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the already dim streetlights into shimmering halos. The siren wailed, a desperate cry cutting through the city's nocturnal hum, but it felt muted, swallowed by the torrential downpour. Inside, Evelyn Roseborough, her brow furrowed in concentration, fought to keep the gurney stable as they careened around a corner. Her gloved fingers tightened on the IV line, ensuring the steady drip of morphine into the young man sprawled on the stretcher. His chest rose and fell in shallow gasps, his face pale and slick with sweat.

Evelyn's heart pounded in her chest, mirroring the frantic rhythm of the ambulance. It wasn't just the rain; it was the urgency of the situation. The call had come in minutes ago â€“ a hit-and-run, cyclist down, possible head trauma. They were racing against time, every second crucial.
