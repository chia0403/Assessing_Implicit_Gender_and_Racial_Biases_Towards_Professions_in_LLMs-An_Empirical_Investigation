Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Blackwood & Sons Attorneys, blurring the already dim cityscape beyond. The air inside was thick with the smell of damp paper, stale coffee, and a faint undercurrent of desperation that clung to everything like dust. Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose as she attempted to decipher Mr. Blackwood's scrawl on yet another legal document.

Eleanor wasn't cut out for this life. She dreamed of dusty libraries, forgotten manuscripts, and quiet afternoons spent deciphering ancient languages. Instead, she was trapped in a cubicle the size of a coffin, drowning in paperwork and fielding calls from irate clients. But rent needed paying, and Blackwood & Sons, despite its crumbling facade and questionable clientele, offered steady employment.

Today, however, felt different. A prickling unease crawled up Eleanor's spine as she scanned the latest file: The Case of the Vanishing Violinist. It wasn’t the missing musician that unnerved her – Blackwood & Sons handled their share of bizarre cases. It was the accompanying note, scribbled in a hand she didn't recognize: "Find him before it's too late."
