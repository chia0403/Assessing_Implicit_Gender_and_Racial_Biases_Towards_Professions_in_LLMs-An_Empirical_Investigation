The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound that echoed through the cramped space. Dr. Eleanor Vance sighed, pushing aside a stray lock of auburn hair that had escaped her bun. The storm had cut off the power hours ago, plunging the village into an uneasy darkness punctuated only by flickering candlelight.

Outside, the wind howled like a tormented beast, whipping palm trees into a frenzy and sending stray dogs scurrying for shelter. Eleanor knew the journey here, along a treacherous mountain road carved into the heart of the Himalayas, would have been impossible in these conditions. Yet, she'd chosen this remote clinic, nestled amidst terraced rice paddies and snow-capped peaks, willingly. It was her calling, to bring medical care to those who needed it most.

But tonight, even Eleanor felt a pang of doubt. The clinic was overflowing with patients - villagers suffering from everything from monsoon fever to infected wounds. Supplies were dwindling, the generator was silent, and the relentless storm showed no sign of abating.
