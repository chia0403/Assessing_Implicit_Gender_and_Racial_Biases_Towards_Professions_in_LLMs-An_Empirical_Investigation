The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, a fragrant counterpoint to the rhythmic clinking of wind chimes outside Amelia Rose Blackwood's window. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign that stubbornly refused to dim.  Amelia sighed, running a hand through her tangled auburn curls. Business was slow tonight, and the solitude was beginning to feel oppressive. Her small massage studio nestled above a bustling Indian restaurant on Bleecker Street, a haven from the relentless energy of New York City.

Despite the quiet evening, Amelia's hands itched for work. She thrived on the human touch, on easing knotted muscles and unraveling tension with every measured stroke. She longed to melt away someone's worries, even if just for an hour. 

Suddenly, a sharp rap at the door jolted her from her reverie.  Amelia straightened, her heart leaping with a flicker of hope. A client after all?
