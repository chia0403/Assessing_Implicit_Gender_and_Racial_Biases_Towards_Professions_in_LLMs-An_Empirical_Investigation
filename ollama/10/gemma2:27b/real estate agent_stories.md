Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Blackwood's cramped office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in her chest.  The once-vibrant "For Sale" sign outside 27 Magnolia Lane now drooped pathetically, mirroring the state of Amelia's hopes for closing the deal. It had been three months, countless open houses, and a dizzying array of failed negotiations. The charming Victorian with its wraparound porch and whimsical gingerbread trim was beginning to feel like an albatross around her neck.

Amelia ran a hand through her messy auburn curls, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across her face.  She couldn't afford another failure. Her commission on 27 Magnolia Lane represented more than just money; it was the key to saving her family's home from foreclosure. The weight of that responsibility pressed down on her like a physical burden.

Suddenly, the phone rang, its shrill sound slicing through the oppressive silence. Amelia snatched up the receiver, her heart leaping with a sliver of hope. Perhaps this call held the answer she desperately sought.
