The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck as he wrestled with a stubborn rose bush. Its thorns, like miniature daggers, snagged at his thick work gloves, threatening to draw blood.  Elias grunted in frustration, sweat trickling down his forehead and stinging his eyes. He loved the smell of freshly turned earth and the vibrant colors of blooming flowers, but today, this overgrown monstrosity was testing his patience. 

He was working on Mrs. Hawthorne's sprawling estate, a Victorian mansion perched atop a hill overlooking the sleepy seaside town of Oakhaven. The house itself was beautiful, with ornate gingerbread trim and ivy crawling up its walls like emerald veins. But the gardens... they were a jungle. Years of neglect had transformed them into a tangled thicket, a forgotten paradise yearning for a skilled hand to restore it to its former glory.

Elias surveyed the scene before him. A towering oak, ancient and gnarled, stood sentinel over the chaos, its leaves casting dappled shadows across the overgrown lawn. Beyond lay a labyrinthine maze of overgrown hedges, their once-precise shapes now lost in a riot of green. Elias sighed. This was going to be a long job.
