Rain lashed against the windshield of Silas Blackwood's battered pickup truck, blurring the already indistinct shapes of towering redwoods into shimmering phantoms. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, a symphony Silas knew by heart after decades spent amongst these ancient giants. He gripped the worn leather steering wheel, knuckles white against the faded brown, his gaze fixed on the barely visible logging road ahead. 

The storm had rolled in fast, catching him off guard halfway back from the day's cut. Now, with night falling and the wind howling like a banshee through the trees, Silas found himself stranded miles from the nearest town. He sighed, a weary sound that mingled with the drumming rain. This wasn't the first time he'd been caught out in bad weather, but something about tonight felt different â€“ an unsettling prickle of unease crawled up his spine.
