Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy General Hospital, blurring the neon glow of the "Emergency" sign into an Impressionistic smear. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed relentlessly, casting a sterile pallor over everything. Emilia Rose Hawthorne, RN, sighed as she surveyed the chaotic scene unfolding before her. Three patients were crammed into one cubicle, their anguished moans competing with the shrill beeping of monitors. A harried doctor barked orders at an intern who looked close to tears. 

Emilia straightened her starched blue scrubs, a wave of weariness washing over her. It was 3:00 AM and she'd already been on shift for twelve hours, but there seemed to be no end in sight. Tonight, Mercy General felt less like a sanctuary and more like the eye of a relentless storm.
