Rain lashed against the windows of the dilapidated clinic, mimicking the relentless pounding in Amelia Rosalind Cartwright’s head. The peeling paint on the walls seemed to weep along with her, mirroring the despair that threatened to drown her. This wasn't how she envisioned her life after graduating top of her class from Columbia University's Physical Therapy program.

Instead of a gleaming state-of-the-art facility, Amelia found herself in a cramped space barely big enough to swing a cane. The only patient she had seen all week was Mrs. Goldstein, an octogenarian with arthritis who insisted on paying in homemade rugelach. 


Amelia sighed, staring at the lone exercise bike gathering dust in the corner.  She needed patients, needed income, needed something – anything – to breathe life back into this dying dream.

Just then, the bell above the door clanged, startling her out of her reverie. A tall, broad-shouldered figure stepped inside, his face obscured by the shadows cast by his wide-brimmed hat. He surveyed the room with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through Amelia's facade of optimism.

"Heard you were the best in town," he said, his voice a gravelly rumble. "Name's Liam O'Connell, and I need your help."
