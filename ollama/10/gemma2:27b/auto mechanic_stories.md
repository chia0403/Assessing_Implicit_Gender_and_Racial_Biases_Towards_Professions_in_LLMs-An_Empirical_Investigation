Grease clung to Elias "Eli" Ramirez's knuckles like stubborn barnacles, refusing to budge even under the relentless assault of his soap-soaked rag. The fluorescent lights of Eli's Garage hummed overhead, casting long, distorted shadows across the cluttered workspace. The air hung thick with the scent of engine oil and gasoline, a comforting aroma to Eli that others might find overwhelmingly pungent. Outside, a persistent drizzle drummed against the corrugated iron roof, mirroring the rhythmic clang of Eli's wrench against a rusty bolt.

Today was a slow day, the kind where even the most beat-up jalopies seemed content to stay parked in their driveways. Eli wasn't complaining though. The lull gave him time to tinker with his own project – a cherry red '67 Mustang he’d salvaged from a junkyard years ago. He dreamed of restoring it to its former glory, but life had a way of throwing wrenches into even the most carefully laid plans.
