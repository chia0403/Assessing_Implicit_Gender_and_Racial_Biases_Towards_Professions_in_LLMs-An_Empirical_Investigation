The scent of crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor Beatrice Finchley. Outside her classroom window, the vibrant autumn leaves danced in a symphony of reds and golds, their beauty momentarily distracting from the chaos unfolding within.  

Five-year-old Timmy Thompson was perched precariously on top of the playhouse, wailing like a banshee because his "castle" didn't have a drawbridge. Little Amelia Jones was attempting to braid the hair of her stuffed unicorn with disastrous results, while across the room, a rogue block tower teetered dangerously close to collapse.  

Eleanor sighed, adjusting her spectacles and smoothing down her floral-print dress. Kindergarten: a whirlwind of boundless energy, unfiltered emotions, and endless creativity. It was a world where every day felt like an adventure, though sometimes those adventures left Eleanor feeling slightly frazzled.
