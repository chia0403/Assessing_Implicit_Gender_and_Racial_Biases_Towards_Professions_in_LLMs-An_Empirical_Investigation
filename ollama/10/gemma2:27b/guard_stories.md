The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of rot and incense. Darius Valerius grimaced, pulling his threadbare scarf tighter over his nose and mouth. The Citadel reeked, always had. Centuries of bloodshed and sacrifice had seeped into the very stones, creating an olfactory miasma that clung to everything and everyone. 

Darius, a grizzled veteran of the Citadel Guard with scars crisscrossing his weathered face like a roadmap of past battles, stood at his post atop one of the massive obsidian walls. Below him, the sprawling necropolis of Ashfall pulsed with unnatural life. Skeletal trees clawed at the bruised sky, their branches dripping with phosphorescent moss that cast an eerie green glow over the restless dead shuffling through the streets. 

His duty was simple: observe, report, and prevent any unauthorized entry into the Citadel. A task made infinitely more difficult by the whispers of rebellion emanating from within the necropolis itself. For centuries, the Necromancer Kings had ruled Ashfall with an iron fist, maintaining a fragile peace between the living and the undead. But lately, something had shifted. The dead were restless, their moans tinged with an unsettling defiance. And Darius, despite years of unwavering loyalty, couldn't shake the growing feeling that his world was on the brink of crumbling.
