The stale air conditioning hummed like an anxious beehive in Eliza Winthrop's ear. It was always too cold in the lobby of Blackwood & Thorne Associates, a prestigious law firm housed in a grand, gothic building that seemed perpetually shrouded in shadows.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the stained-glass windows, casting the waiting area in a perpetual twilight. Eliza shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around herself despite the fact that her desk lamp practically radiated heat.

She glanced at the antique grandfather clock ticking away against the far wall, its ornate hands pointing to 4:52 pm. Five minutes until freedom. Five minutes until she could ditch this stuffy building and head to Mrs. O'Malley's bakery for a slice of her famous apple pie and a cup of steaming chamomile tea.

Just then, the heavy oak doors swung open with a resounding thud, heralding the arrival of a new client. Eliza straightened in her chair, plastering on her best professional smile. This was Blackwood & Thorne after all; every client was a potential gold mine, even if they arrived looking like they'd just crawled out from under a bridge.
