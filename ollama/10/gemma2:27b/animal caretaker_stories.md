The air hung thick with the scent of hay and pine needles in the barn stalls, punctuated by the occasional whinny or bleat. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her auburn braid escaping its ties as she worked, carefully refilled the water trough for the two miniature goats, Buttercup and Marigold. Sunlight streamed through the gaps in the wooden planks, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the early morning chirping of sparrows was slowly drowned out by the rumble of a delivery truck pulling onto the gravel drive. Amelia straightened, wiping her hands on her overalls, a weary but satisfied smile gracing her lips. This was her life - tending to the animals at Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary, a haven for abandoned and rescued creatures.  Today promised to be a busy one; a new arrival was expected â€“ a timid alpaca with a heartbreaking past. Amelia couldn't wait to welcome him into their fold.
