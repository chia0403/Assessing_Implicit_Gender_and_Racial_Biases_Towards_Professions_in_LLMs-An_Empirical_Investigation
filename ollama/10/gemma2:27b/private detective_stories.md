Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" bar sign across the street. Inside his cramped office, Silas Blackwood squinted at the photograph in his hand. A young woman, her auburn hair framing a face etched with worry. The missing person report lay open beside it: Bethany Rose, 23, vanished three days ago from her apartment downtown.

Silas took a drag from his cigarette, letting the acrid smoke fill his lungs before exhaling slowly. Another lost soul in this city that chewed people up and spat them out like stale gum. He'd seen it all - infidelity, blackmail, even murder - but missing persons cases always got to him. The unknown gnawed at him, the possibilities swirling like the rain outside.  

He tapped the photograph against his desk, a battered oak behemoth that had witnessed countless confessions and lies. "Bethany Rose," he murmured, her name echoing in the silence of his office. He'd take the case, of course. It was what he did. But something about her worried face, the faint glimmer of hope in her eyes, tugged at him with an unusual intensity.
