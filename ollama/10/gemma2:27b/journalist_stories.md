The air hung heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed, a familiar perfume to Elara Blackwood, but one that never quite lost its ability to both invigorate and melancholize her. The small fishing village of Port Haven clung stubbornly to the craggy cliffs overlooking the restless North Sea, its colorful houses huddled together like frightened children against the relentless wind.

Elara adjusted her battered satchel, the worn leather creaking in protest as she trudged up the narrow cobblestone street. It was barely dawn, but the sky already glowed with an angry orange, mirroring the churning waters below. Today's assignment: uncover the truth behind the recent string of unexplained disappearances plaguing the village, a story that had sent shivers down even the most hardened spines in Port Haven.
