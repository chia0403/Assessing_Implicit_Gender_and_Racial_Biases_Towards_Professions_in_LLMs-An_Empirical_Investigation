The sun beat down on Arthur's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his worn-out baseball cap into a wilted sombrero. Dust motes danced in the filtered light from the enormous oak at the edge of Mrs. Henderson's lawn, its sprawling branches casting lazy shadows across the manicured green.  Arthur, a man who knew more about dirt and dew than he did about anything else, adjusted his worn glasses with one hand, his other expertly wielding a rake that looked ancient even by the standards of a seasoned landscaper like himself. 

He'd been tending Mrs. Henderson's lawn since she moved in ten years ago, back when her garden was a riot of overgrown weeds and wild flowers. Arthur had tamed it with his own brand of magic – a touch of precision here, a dash of creativity there. Now, the garden bloomed like a fragrant symphony of color, each flower an ode to the care he'd infused into every inch of its existence.  But today, the usual quiet hum of bees and rustling leaves was replaced by a jarring silence that sent shivers down Arthur's spine. 

He squinted towards the old oak tree, his brow furrowing as he realized something was off. The usually peaceful stillness felt…wrong. A strange tension thrummed through the air, as if even the wind held its breath waiting for something to happen.
