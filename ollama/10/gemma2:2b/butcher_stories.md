## The Smell of Sorrow

**Setting:**  A ramshackle shop front with peeling paint and hanging signs that advertise everything from "Superior Quality Beef" to "Don't Be Shy, Get Your Ham."  Sunlight streams in through dusty windows onto the cluttered interior, where a symphony of animal fat and metal clangs plays as young Theodore “Teddy” Miller wrestles with a particularly stubborn carcass. The air hangs thick with the stench of blood, salt, and aged leather. 

**Character:** Teddy Miller, his hands scarred and calloused from years of working the meat counter at his family's butcher shop.  He is known for his rough charm, his booming laugh that can drown out any complaint, and his uncanny ability to predict which cuts will sell on a Friday. But beneath the jovial exterior lies a soul burdened by secrets, each one more agonizing than the last. 

**Opening:** The rain poured relentlessly outside, mirroring the storm brewing inside Teddy. His father's sudden illness had left him responsible for the shop and his little brother, young Finn. A knot of anxiety tightened in Teddy's chest as he wrestled with the pig carcass, each swipe of the cleaver echoing the silent screams of his family’s unspoken grief. He knew they were all drowning in sorrow, but Teddy couldn't share it. Not yet. He was the strong one, the stoic protector.  He had to be the beacon of hope, even as the storm within raged on.
