The air hung thick with the scent of diesel and freshly-turned asphalt, a heady cocktail that usually invigorated Harold "Hawk" Peterson but today it just felt cloying.  He squinted at the sun glinting off the endless ribbon of I-80 stretching before him, a concrete serpent snaking its way across the plains of Nebraska. It was another sweltering day in August, and the wind that whipped through Hawk's worn bandana felt more like sandpaper than air against his face. 

Hawk surveyed the scene: a crew of six men working with feverish intensity at their usual rhythm â€“ screwdrivers tapping, heavy equipment humming, and voices shouting instructions across the construction site.  It was just after noon, and the monotony of the work had settled in, heavier than any of their steel beams ever could be. His gaze drifted to the horizon, where a lone hawk circled high above, its cry echoing through the vast emptiness like a lonely lament.
