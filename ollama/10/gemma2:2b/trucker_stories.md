The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of diesel fuel and exhaust as  Bartholomew "Bart" Miller shifted his weight from one foot to the other, squinting at the endless grey expanse of the Nevada desert. The sun, already a brutal glare in the late afternoon, beat down on the semi-trailer like an uncaring hammer. Bart's calloused hands tightened around the worn leather steering wheel.

Bart was used to the desolate landscape. He'd spent years traversing these barren stretches, navigating through ghost towns and dust storms, feeling strangely at peace in this unforgiving world. Yet, something about the emptiness tonight felt different.  It wasn't just the heat or the endless horizon; there was a nagging sense of anticipation that stirred unease within him.
