## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Beaumont’s clinic, blurring the already muted city lights into an ethereal watercolor of gray and purple. The air hung thick with steam from the simmering pot of herbal tea on the counter, a comforting aroma battling the metallic tang of rain and the raw anxiety settling in Dr. Beaumont's gut.  She glanced at her schedule - five late arrivals, three cancellations due to weather, one patient claiming a "persistent feeling of being stuck." Evelyn sighed, running a calloused hand through her auburn curls, the worry etched deep into the lines on her face.

The small town of Oakhaven, tucked between rolling hills and a sprawling forest, was known for its charming old-world feel and quaint atmosphere - but lately, the air had become thick with something more unsettling, something that felt like rust creeping beneath the paint of normalcy.  A sense of fear hung in the crisp October air, almost as palpable as the smell of wet earth and leaves clinging to the cobblestone streets.
