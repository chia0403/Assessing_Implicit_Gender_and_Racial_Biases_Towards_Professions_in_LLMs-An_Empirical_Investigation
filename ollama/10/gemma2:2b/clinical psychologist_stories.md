Rain lashed against the worn awning outside Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, the sound almost a counterpoint to the steady hum of her antique typewriter. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of old leather and chamomile – a comforting aroma that did little to ease the storm raging within her own soul.  Eleanor adjusted the collar of her tweed jacket, the worn fabric rough against her skin, as she turned the keys. 

The patient's name, etched in bold letters on the appointment sheet, was a reminder of her own turmoil: Mr. Arthur Hayes – agoraphobic, terrified of his own reflection and the world beyond his apartment. He hadn’t been responding well to the usual cognitive-behavioral therapy, even after weeks of dedicated work. 

Eleanor sighed, the weight of expectation pressing down on her like a physical burden. As a clinical psychologist with decades of experience, she knew this journey could be difficult, but this case had taken its toll – not just on Mr. Hayes, but also on Eleanor's own hope and determination.  She stared at his profile in the file, wondering if perhaps there was something more to his fear than she’d been able to grasp, a hidden layer of pain, an unspoken wound that lay beneath the surface. 


**Setting:**

A small, cluttered office nestled within a quiet brick building on a quiet side street in Chicago. The office is lined with bookshelves filled with psychology-themed tomes and a battered armchair by the window overlooking a busy city street.  The only other furniture is a heavy oak desk covered in files and medical notes, illuminated by the warm glow of her antique desk lamp.
