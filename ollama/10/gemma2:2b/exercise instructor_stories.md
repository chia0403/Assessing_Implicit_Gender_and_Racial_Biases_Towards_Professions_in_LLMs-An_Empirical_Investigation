The humid Miami air clung to Emilia Flores like a second skin as she surveyed her usual Sunday morning class.  Sweat dripped from her brow even under the shade of the sprawling palm trees lining the outdoor gym. Around her, a kaleidoscope of spandex and neon pink yoga mats unfolded across the soft earth – an unlikely setting for a city known for its concrete jungle.  The rhythmic clang of metal weights against steel echoed softly through the air as Emilia, clad in her signature sunflower-printed leggings and turquoise tank top, began her warm-up routine.

“Alright, fam! Get those endorphins flowing!” she boomed with an infectious smile, her voice barely audible over the soft hum of cicadas. “Just a little bit more sunshine, a little less stress, and we’ll be ready for Monday.”
