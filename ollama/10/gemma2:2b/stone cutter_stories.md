## The Stone's Whispers

**Setting:** The wind whipped sand against the cracked face of old Elias Thorne, his calloused fingers gripping the weathered handle of his chisel like it was an extension of himself. He worked with practiced ease on the enormous granite slab before him, its surface already scarred by weeks of toil – a rough canvas for the masterpiece he hoped to paint. The air hung thick and heavy with desert heat as the setting sun bled crimson hues across the unforgiving landscape. 

**Character:**  Elias Thorne was a man who lived closer to the stone than any other man in the village. His hands, gnarled by time and labor, held secrets whispered from the earth's heart; secrets he sought to unravel and bring forth on the canvas of granite. He wasn’t just a stone cutter; he was an artist with his own unique language – one that spoke of power and resilience, of the silent stories etched onto each rock face by millennia. 

**Opening:** "The wind carries whispers," Elias murmured, his voice hoarse from years of working in the arid environment. He felt the stone vibrate beneath his chisel, a low hum resonating through his bones.  "It speaks to me,” he said, his eyes closed for a moment as if listening to something only he could hear. "Tell it...of my work."
 
He picked up his hammer and swung it down on the granite, leaving a deep furrow in the stone's face. A frown creased his weathered forehead as the stone yielded its resistance, revealing the contours of an ancient dragon buried within its depths.
