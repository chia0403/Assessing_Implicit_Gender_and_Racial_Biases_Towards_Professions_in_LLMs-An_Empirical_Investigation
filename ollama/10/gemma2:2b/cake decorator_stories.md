The air in "Sweet Surrender" was thick with the scent of vanilla and sugar – not exactly the most romantic aroma one might associate with love, but that's just how Mrs. Eleanor Buttercream liked it.  The little bakery nestled on Maple Street wasn't flashy by any means; its pale yellow walls were faded from years of sun and buttercream stains. But inside, a symphony of whirring machines and bubbling sugar spun into life. 

Eleanor was the queen of her castle – or at least that's how she saw it. With hands as steady as they were graceful, she moved through the space like a hummingbird in a flower garden. Her signature frosted roses bloomed from cakes with an almost impossible precision, each petal so delicate it seemed to hold its own air currents.

The Duchess, notorious for her fickle whims and demanding tastes, had left Eleanor with an intricate blueprint that resembled a gothic stained glass window more than a cake – all sharp angles and swirling patterns.  Eleanor chewed on her lip, her usual grin replaced by a furrowed brow as she surveyed the challenge before her.
