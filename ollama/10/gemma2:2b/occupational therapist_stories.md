Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, mimicking the frantic beat in Evelyn Miller's chest. She was surrounded by stacks of brightly coloured books, each filled with detailed diagrams of hands tracing imaginary circles on air, but her gaze couldn't stay focused. Outside, the storm raged on, reflecting the turmoil within her. 

Evelyn was about to see her newest patient, an elderly woman named Mrs. Petrov, a widow who had fallen into a deep depression since losing her husband of fifty years. She hadn't been able to manage simple tasks like combing her hair, let alone navigate the complexities of life after loss. Evelyn’s heart sank as she remembered how Mrs. Petrov’s story mirrored her own struggle with grief -  the suffocating weight of loneliness, a world that suddenly felt too big and confusing to traverse alone. 

The clinic was nestled on the outskirts of a bustling city, a quiet oasis in a sea of concrete and steel. The aroma of freshly brewed chamomile tea drifted from the tiny kitchen, a stark contrast to the biting wind whipping outside. It was here, surrounded by the gentle hum of human interaction and the comforting scent of chamomile, that Evelyn hoped she could navigate this stormy day with Mrs. Petrov.
