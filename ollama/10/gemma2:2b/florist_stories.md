## The Petal & Thorn

**Opening:** Rain lashed against the frosted glass of the window at Rose's Florist, its rhythm almost hypnotic in its repetition.  Rose sighed, leaning her weight against the antique oak counter behind which a lifetime of dried blooms and wilted dreams clung to the space like dust motes caught in sunlight. She ran a finger across a faded photo frame, the image of a younger, brighter Rose gazing out from a field of sunflowers - a promise of something more than just petals and thorns.

**Setting:** The quaint town of Oakhaven nestled amongst rolling hills was a place that cherished tradition, but not enough to ignore the changing tides of time.  Rose's Florist, a cornerstone of the community for over three decades, stood proudly on Main Street, its red awning weathered and faded, yet still welcoming. 

**Main Character:** **Rosalind "Rose" Thorne** was the last of her line in Oakhaven. A skilled and passionate florist, she had inherited her grandmother's shop after a string of unfortunate events that left the other members of her family scattered across the globe like lost petals on a harsh wind. The shop wasnâ€™t just a business; it was Rose's lifeline to a legacy she felt obligated to uphold, even when its beauty seemed to be fading as surely as the seasons changed.
