The fluorescent hum of the supermarket lights buzzed overhead, mimicking the anxious thrum in Elara's chest. A chill wind whistled through the automatic doors as it swung open again, releasing a rush of rain-soaked air and the pungent aroma of yesterday’s groceries left to wilt in the back room. 10:35 PM. Just about five hours before they shut down for the night. Elara sighed, smoothing down her worn apron. It was always like this after the late shift – a quiet tension that clung to the air like condensation on the grocery store windows. Tonight, it felt heavier than usual.

It wasn't just the closing time; tonight was the anniversary of the "incident". A night she still remembered with a mix of fear and resentment. It had been five years since the security cameras caught them – her colleagues, not even strangers, stealing from the store’s stock. Five years of whispered gossip, of judgment, of Elara being branded as “the cashier who got taken advantage of.” 

She glanced at the crumpled receipt in her hand. "Late Shift Special: Milk and cookies for you," she muttered under her breath. The thought was a bitter pill. All she wanted tonight was the quiet hum of the machines, to finally escape this place before tomorrow’s dawn, and maybe dream a little about something other than the shadow that clung to her like a second skin.
