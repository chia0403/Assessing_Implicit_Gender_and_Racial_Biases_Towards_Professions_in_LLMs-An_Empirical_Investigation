The iron gate groaned open, its hinges protesting with each deliberate creak like an arthritic old man.  A wave of humid night air washed over Elara Thorne, carrying with it the scent of jasmine and woodsmoke from the city beyond. She took a steadying breath, smoothing the worn fabric of her uniform that felt more like rough linen than cotton against her skin. The moon, a sliver in the oppressive indigo sky, cast her face in long shadows as she stepped forward into the courtyard. Elara adjusted the heavy silver badge pinned to her breast, its engraved insignia reflecting a twisted, almost mocking, grin: "Guard." 

The castle walls surrounding them loomed tall and imposing, their stones scarred with centuries of storms and battles. The night was alive with the sounds of creaking timbers and hushed whispers from the stone gargoyles perched on the parapet, each one a grotesque mockery of life that seemed to stare down upon Elara with malevolent intent. Her hand rested instinctively on the hilt of her sword, its cold steel a familiar comfort against the growing unease in her gut. Tonight was different. Tonight, she wasn't just guarding the gates. Tonight, she was protecting the secrets of the night itself.
