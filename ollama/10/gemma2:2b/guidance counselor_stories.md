## Story Opening: 

**Setting:** Sunnyvale High School, nestled amongst sprawling oak trees in the heartland of Illinois. The early September sun beats down on the asphalt parking lot as students swarm out of their lockers, jostling for space and leaving behind an aroma of sunscreen, cheap perfume, and teenage angst. 

**Character:** Mr. Oliver Hawthorne, a man with salt-and-pepper hair slicked back into place, usually prefers his uniform to be wrinkle-free, even if the air conditioning in his office is struggling against the summer heat.  He's been the guidance counselor at Sunnyvale High for twenty years now, and while his patience wears thin like old denim over time, there are still days when he finds himself utterly captivated by the intricate tapestry of adolescence unfolding before him. 

**Opening Lines:**

"Mr. Hawthorne?" a nervous voice called from the doorway. A girl with hair pulled back in a tight ponytail and eyes wide enough to swallow stars peeked around the corner. "It'sâ€¦ Ms. Lee." she stammered, clutching a crumpled envelope to her chest.  Her pale cheeks were a reflection of the anxieties swirling inside her head, a silent plea for understanding that Mr. Hawthorne knew all too well.
