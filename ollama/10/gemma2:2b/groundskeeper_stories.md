The crisp air bit at Elara Thorne's cheeks as she hurried across the sprawling lawns of Blackwood Manor. Rain pattered down on the emerald green grass, each drop leaving shimmering trails of silver against the fading afternoon light. Even with her thick, woolen coat, Elara felt chilled to her bones. She tugged a tattered scarf tighter around her neck, glancing nervously at the imposing manor's stone facade that loomed over her. Blackwood Manor had always been...different, its atmosphere thick and heavy with secrets whispered in forgotten winds.

As head groundskeeper for the past ten years, Elara knew better than anyone the stories etched into every corner of the property. Stories of forbidden romances, of hushed conversations in moonlit gardens, of a family cursed to wander within their own walls.  She held these stories like dusty keepsakes, her heart pounding with a mixture of trepidation and fascination as she approached the manor's grand entrance.
