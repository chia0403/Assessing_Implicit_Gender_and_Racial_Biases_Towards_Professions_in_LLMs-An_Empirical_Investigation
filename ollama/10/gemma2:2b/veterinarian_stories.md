The salty air whipped Amelia’s hair around her face as she stood at the edge of the dock. The vast expanse of the bay stretched before her, mirroring the uncertainty churning in her stomach. It was August, and the summer heat shimmered off the water like molten gold, making even the sturdy oak planks of the docks seem to melt under the unrelenting sun.  Her name is Amelia Thorne, and today was her first day as a veterinarian in Oakhaven – a quaint seaside town brimming with charm and secrets she wasn't yet prepared for. 

The small clinic, nestled amidst towering houses with gingerbread trim and brightly blooming gardens, sat like an oasis of tranquility amidst the chaotic hum of life on the dock.  Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of old books and disinfectant, a comforting mix that did little to soothe her nerves. Amelia glanced at the weathered door, then back at the endless blue horizon, feeling both excited and terrified by this leap into the unknown. 


**Setting:** Oakhaven is a small coastal town in New England, known for its picturesque charm and thriving fishing industry. The dock serves as a bustling hub of activity, connecting the town to the wide world.
