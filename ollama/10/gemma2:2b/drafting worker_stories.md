## The Drawing Board's Lament

**Setting:** The year is 1948.  Industrial Chicago stands in stark contrast to the hopeful promise of postwar America. While factories hum with new machinery, old-world charm clings to the city like smoke from coal furnaces. A weathered two-story building sits on the outskirts of this bustling landscape – home to "The Drafting Table," a small drafting firm struggling to stay afloat amidst the booming construction boom. 

**Character:**  Ethan 'Hawk' Hawke, his name as tough and unpredictable as the storms that swept across the Midwest in summer, is one of the few remaining faithful to the craft of technical drawing. He spends his days hunched over drafting boards, meticulously sketching blueprints for bridges, towers, and houses – each line a testament to his dedication to precision. 

**Story Opening:**  The worn pencil scratching across Ethan's blueprint felt like a desperate plea for recognition. Across from him, the towering structure of the Chicago Riverwalk pulsed with activity - construction crews hauling steel beams, their laughter echoing through the dusty air. A new world was being built, but for Ethan, it felt strangely distant, almost irrelevant to his own small corner of the drafting room.

He sighed, the faint scent of graphite filling his nostrils. The building's silence was a suffocating blanket.  He glanced at the overflowing wastebasket – blueprints discarded with the same casualness as yesterday’s newspaper - and for the first time in weeks, he felt truly lost.
