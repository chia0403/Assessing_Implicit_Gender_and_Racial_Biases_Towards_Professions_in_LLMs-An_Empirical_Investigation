The scent of burnt coffee clung to the air in Mrs. Eleanor Davies' classroom like an unwelcome guest. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, casting long, slanted shadows across her cluttered desk.  It was 7:30 AM and Mrs. Davies, perched on the edge of her worn armchair, waited for her students to trickle in.  Her name wasn't exactly "Eleanor" - she'd chosen it at seventeen, as a way to break away from the stifling formality of her childhood name, Amelia. Now, twenty years later, the choice was starting to feelâ€¦ less revolutionary.  

The bell clanged outside, signaling the arrival of Mrs. Hernandez's third-period students. As usual, they were a cacophony of groans and muttered complaints, shuffling into the room like a flock of restless birds. It was her first year teaching AP English at Westlake High, and she was already feeling the pressure.  Westlake was anything but ordinary; the school's reputation for academic excellence had attracted a diverse crowd, some of whom seemed more interested in their phone screens than Shakespeare.
