The fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous symphony above, casting an anemic glow on the endless expanse of linoleum tiles. Bartholomew "Barty" Finch, his worn-out janitorial uniform clinging to him like a second skin, wiped down the stainless steel sink in the crowded cafeteria, the remnants of yesterday's lunch still clinging stubbornly to its surface. The place was normally abuzz with students and professors alike, but today it felt eerily quiet, even for a Wednesday afternoon. 

Bartyâ€™s eyes drifted across the room, taking in the stark contrast between the vibrant energy of the student groups huddled over tables and the somber stillness of the remaining chairs.  A heavy silence seemed to cling to everything like a damp shroud. It was the kind of silence that whispered secrets in the corners of the cafeteria and lingered longer than it should. Something felt off. 
 
He had been sweeping the halls, humming along to an old Billy Joel song on his worn-out earbuds, when he saw her. She stood at the far end of the room, by a darkened corner where the last remnants of light filtered in from the nearby window. Her back was to him, and he couldn't help but feel drawn to her like a moth to a flickering flame.  She was tall, with a cascade of raven hair that flowed down her shoulders like liquid midnight, and her posture held an elegance that seemed both powerful and fragile at the same time. 

As Barty approached, he found himself unable to tear his eyes away from the sight before him. The air around her shimmered, as if she were made of spun moonlight itself.
