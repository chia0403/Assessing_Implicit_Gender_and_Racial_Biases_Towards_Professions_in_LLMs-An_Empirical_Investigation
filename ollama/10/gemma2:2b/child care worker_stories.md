## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of Sunshine Cottage, blurring the already-dim light filtering through the blinds. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Bellweather bustled about, her brow furrowed as she checked schedules and prepared for the arrival of the first of her little charges: tiny Finn, all toothy grins and boundless energy, bouncing on his feet like a bouncy ball in waiting. Amy had been working as a child care worker at Sunshine Cottage for six years – ever since graduating college with dreams of becoming an elementary teacher. But the realities of raising tuition fees and navigating the city's competitive job market had forced her to adjust those aspirations. 

As she surveyed the kitchen, her mind drifted back to the first day, just weeks after graduating. The smell of fresh-baked cookies clung to the air, the warmth of children’s laughter echoing through the room. She’d fallen in love with the simple act of watching them grow - a tiny seed blossoming into a sapling, reaching for the light, their curiosity a constant source of wonder. 

The sound of the front door creaking open jolted her back to reality. Little Finn burst in, his blue eyes wide with excitement, and a mischievous grin plastered across his face as he held out a red crayon: “Miss Amy!  Look!”


**Setting:**

A cozy cottage-style childcare centre nestled amongst tree-lined streets in the heart of a bustling city. Sunshine Cottage caters to young children aged 2-6 years old. It's a warm, welcoming space with brightly colored walls, bookshelves stacked high with storybooks, and toys scattered about playfully – a testament to Amy’s love for fostering childhood creativity and wonder. The air is thick with the aroma of freshly baked cookies and milk. Outside, the storm rages on, but inside, there's a sense of calm and joyful anticipation as children await their afternoon fun.
