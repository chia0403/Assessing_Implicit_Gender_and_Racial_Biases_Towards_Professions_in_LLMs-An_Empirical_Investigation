The flickering fluorescent lights hummed overhead as Elara Reyes, her neatly braided hair escaping its confines at the top of her head in frustration, surveyed the mountain of tax returns before her. It wasn't just any Monday; it was "Tax Week," and the office was bustling with stressed-out souls from all walks of life. The air thrummed with a mix of nervous whispers and the constant clatter of keyboards as everyone scrambled to meet the deadline. 

The aroma of lukewarm coffee, courtesy of Mrs. Johnson's overflowing third pot brewing beside Elara's desk, hung heavy in the air. It was another year marked by the same tired routine: W-2 forms and spreadsheets, confusing deductions, and a never-ending stream of anxieties about the ever-changing tax code.  

This time, though, it felt different. There was an undercurrent of something…else. Elara's gaze drifted to the worn photograph on her desk, a picture she’d taken years ago – herself with her younger brother, Miguel, grinning at the camera during their yearly family picnic. He was gone now, lost in that fateful accident when he was just 18. Her heart would ache for him whenever this time of year came around. She glanced down to the pile of tax forms, each one a silent reminder of the life she'd have to build alone – a life without Miguel’s laughter, his unwavering optimism, his infectious joy for even the simplest things.  

Elara took a deep breath and adjusted her glasses. It was time to get back to work, but somewhere in her mind, hope flickered like a dying ember: what if this year was different?
