The wrench felt heavy in Elara Thorne's hand as she squinted at the engine bay. The greasy, metallic smell hung thick in the air, mingling with the scent of old gasoline and burnt oil.  She pulled her hair back from her forehead, tucking a loose strand behind her ear, before turning on the shop light. 20 years, and every inch of this garage was etched with stories – memories of engine pops and hissing leaks, triumphs of fixing what was meant to be broken, and even the occasional whispered secrets exchanged between the grease and grime. It was Elara's lifeblood, her canvas where she could transform chaos into a symphony of whirring gears and purring engines. 

Tonight, the symphony was silent. The late afternoon air hung heavy with a melancholic stillness that seemed to amplify the usual hum of this sanctuary.  Her gaze darted from the engine block to the overflowing toolbox to the chipped mug sitting on the workbench where she'd left her coffee – forgotten in the whirlwind of troubleshooting.
