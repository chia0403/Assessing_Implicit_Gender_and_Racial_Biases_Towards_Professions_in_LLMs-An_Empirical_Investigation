## The Scent of Old Medicine

**Setting:**  A rundown hospice in the shadow of an imposing city skyline. Rain lashed against the cracked windows, mimicking the frantic drumming in Evelyn "Evie" Thorne's chest as she stood at the bedside of Mrs. Davenport, her eyes reflecting a million unspoken stories. 

**Character:** Evie Thorne, a registered nurse with hands hardened by years of tending to the dying and yet still holding onto a spark of youthful optimism.  Evie had been assigned to Mrs. Davenport for two weeks now, ever since the woman's husband passed away. While her colleagues viewed the job as a routine, Evie saw it as an impossible labyrinth, filled with whispers of forgotten dreams and hidden pain.


The room smelled of stale air and disinfectant, the only fresh scent coming from a single lavender-scented sachet on Mrs. Davenport's nightstand.  Evie took a deep breath, remembering the faint fragrance her grandmother had used to evoke memories of home and family. It felt like a cruel echo in this desolate space. 

"How are you holding up, Evie?" came the voice from behind.  Dr. Miller, the seasoned physician who ran the hospice, sat beside Mrs. Davenport's chair, his eyes filled with a familiar weariness that only years of watching humanity's final chapter could yield. "You've been here for days, haven’t you?” 

Evie forced a smile, her own weary reflection staring back from the steel-blue eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses.  “Just…observing, Doc.”  It was a lie, she knew it.  The scent of old medicine hung heavy in the air, each whiff a reminder of Mrs. Davenport’s fading life. 


She couldn't escape the feeling that this wasn't just about medication and care, but about piecing together the fragments of a forgotten story, a woman lost in time like her own soul.
