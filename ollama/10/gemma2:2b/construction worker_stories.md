The late summer sun beat down on Jericho Hayes's neck, making the sweat prickle under his grime-stained collar. He stood at the edge of the building site, watching as foreman Tony Garcia barked instructions to the crew. The air thrummed with the drone of pneumatic drills and the rhythmic clangs of steel against metal. Jericho’s worn boots sank into the soft earth where he’d been planting a new foundation for weeks. It was a brutal kind of work – hours under the unforgiving sun, sweat stinging his eyes, dirt clinging to everything from his jeans to his bones. 

Jericho's world was concrete and steel, punctuated by the occasional symphony of machinery and the steady pulse of city life echoing in the distance. He’d been a construction worker for as long as he could remember, growing up with the smell of sawdust and paint thinner clinging to his father’s old workshop. Even now, at 28, the feeling of sweat slicking against his skin under the unforgiving sun held a familiar comfort.  His hands had built more than just structures – they'd sculpted memories; the jagged edges of a childhood home he helped rebuild with his own two hands, the rough-hewn table where his grandfather taught him how to work wood. 

This new project was no different. But there was something about the way this building, rising against the skyline like an angry fist, seemed to have life breathed into it. The anticipation thrumming through Tony's voice as he described a "landmark" building, whispered promises of change in his tone, fueled a nervous energy within Jericho. He’d been told he would see something special, something worth remembering about this project – something more than just brick and mortar.
