The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Sterling, a symphony that never seemed to quite end.  She wiped down a corner of her patient's chair in the sterile silence of Dr. Lee’s small office, the scent of fluoride and anticipation clinging to the air like a faint perfume. Outside, the San Francisco drizzle hammered against the windows, mimicking the rapid thrumming of Amy's own anxious heart. The 10:15 appointment was already running late. It wasn't the patients she worried about, it was her upcoming wedding. 

Amelia, known for her meticulousness and quiet resolve as a dental hygienist, was struggling with a different kind of pressure today.  She’d chosen the small-town charm of Mendocino over the bustling life of San Francisco and even found herself yearning for the comforting familiarity of her childhood home in Vermont, the one she’d left behind with dreams and a touch of heartbreak. 

The wedding was a week away, the dress a constant reminder of all that was yet to be achieved.  Amy's fiance, David, had promised her a love story worthy of its own fairytale; a love built on shared laughter and quiet understanding, not on rushed decisions or empty promises.  Yet she found herself struggling to see it in the mirror, her reflection masked by anxiety and unfulfilled aspirations.

The sounds of the clinic are muted, the hum of machinery barely audible as it blends with the rhythmic drip of a faucet somewhere in the back.

**Main Character:**
Amelia "Amy" Sterling - A quiet and observant dental hygienist who prioritizes efficiency and precision in her work.  She is intelligent and capable, but secretly struggles with anxiety about her upcoming wedding.
