##  The Waiting Room

**Opening:** The fluorescent hum of the waiting room's overhead lights buzzed like trapped bees as Amelia "Amy" Finch, a seasoned phlebotomist with calloused hands and weary eyes, sat perched on her stool. A young woman in a floral sundress fidgeted nervously beside her, clutching an oversized duffel bag adorned with glitter pens and mismatched patches. 

**Setting:** The small clinic was tucked away on the edge of town, its exterior a faded brick facade that whispered "forgotten."  Its interior smelled faintly of bleach and antiseptic, punctuated by a faint, floral scent courtesy of Amy's favorite lavender hand cream. A worn-out tapestry depicting a serene meadow hung precariously from one wall, a testament to some bygone era of optimism. 

**Main Character:** Amelia Finch, or Amy as she preferred, was known in the medical community for her steely gaze and the uncanny way she could calm even the most panicked patient.  She had spent years honing her craft, witnessing life's ebb and flow through a needle, each vein a whisper of a story waiting to be told. Tonight, though, the weight of unspoken anxieties hung heavy in the air. It was not just another patient; this one felt different, like someone holding their breath before a storm.  

**Next Scene:** Amy looked at the woman, noticing her wide eyes and trembling hands. "Is something troubling you?" she asked, her voice soft but firm.
