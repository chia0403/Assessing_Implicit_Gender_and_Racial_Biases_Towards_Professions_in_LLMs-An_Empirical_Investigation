Rain lashed against the high windows of Blackwood Manor, blurring the already muted light filtering through the heavy curtains. Inside, Elara Thorne, despite her years spent in service to others, felt an echo of power in the storm's fury. The manor was vast, its sprawling rooms holding secrets as thick and dark as the chimney smoke curling from the hearth. She stood by the grand oak doors, a tremor running through her fingers, clutching the worn brass handle.  

Elara had worked for Blackwood family since she was a girl. For years, she'd swept dust from portraits of stern-faced ancestors, straightened spines on ancient books, and filled endless teacups with steaming, comforting liquid. Each day was a meticulous routine, yet this storm felt different. It carried whispers of something more than just the rain - an unsettling weight that pressed upon Elara like the old world secrets swirling in the air. 
 
Blackwood Manor, once vibrant and welcoming, now held a silence heavy enough to choke on. Only the howling wind seemed to breathe life into its ancient halls. A shiver ran down Elara's spine as she felt a presence behind her â€“ an unseen weight pressing against the back of her neck.  She slowly turned, her heart pounding in time with the drumming rain.
