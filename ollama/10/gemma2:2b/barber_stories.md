The bell above the door chimed softly as Silas Blackwood stepped into The Iron Throne Barbershop. Steam from a nearby kettle rose in plumes towards the ceiling, mingling with the tangy scent of sandalwood oil and freshly shaven heads. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window, casting dancing patterns on the worn linoleum floor. A worn leather armchair sat against the wall, facing the mirrored back wall where Silas was accustomed to watching his customers' faces soften as their anxieties melted away in a wave of warmth and calm.

Silas had spent over twenty years carving himself a niche in this small-town barbershop. He wasnâ€™t just a barber; he was a storyteller, a confidante, a gentle hand that caressed the edges of each man's soul.  His razor felt like an extension of his own thoughts and anxieties, gliding across skin with the precision of a surgeon and the touch of a seasoned poet. 

He adjusted his fedora, its brim shielding him from the sudden gusts of autumn wind whistling through the open door. Today, however, was different. A new face sat across from him - a man named Arthur Miller, all sharp angles and haunted eyes. He wore a tailored suit that seemed to try too hard to appear elegant, yet felt somehow out of place in this small-town haven.
