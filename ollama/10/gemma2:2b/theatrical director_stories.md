## The Curtain Rises

The air hung thick with anticipation in the cavernous dressing room of The Grand Majestic Theater.  Even the ornate chandelier seemed to hum with unspoken anxiety, its crystal prisms catching the muted blue light of the setting sun filtering through the heavy curtains.  **Marceline Blackwood**, renowned director and owner of a reputation as sharp-witted and demanding as the stage lights themselves, paced back and forth, her crimson silk scarf fluttering around her neck like a warning flag. 

The play was a sprawling, ambitious work by the late William Hawthorne: "A Tapestry of Time," an epic journey through history's greatest triumphs and tragedies. It was Marceline’s first production for The Grand Majestic after years spent at the smaller, more intimate Theater Under the Stars.  The grandeur of the venue, with its ornate stage backdrop and towering wings, both exhilarated and terrified her. 

She stopped in front of a mirror hanging precariously on one wall, examining her reflection – a woman whose sharp gaze and steely lips hinted at a world far more complex than those who met her on the street.  "Focus, Marceline," she muttered, "The curtain rises in an hour."
