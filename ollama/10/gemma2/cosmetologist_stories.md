The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and coconut shampoo as Amelia Rose "Amy" Carter surveyed her salon kingdom. Sunlight streamed through the large front windows, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air and highlighting the rows of colorful hair products lining the shelves. Outside, the bustling city of Savannah throbbed with life, but within the walls of "Shear Serenity," time seemed to slow. 

Amy adjusted her tortoiseshell spectacles and glanced at the schedule on her tablet. Her first appointment was a highlight refresh for Mrs. Eleanor Hayes, a pillar of Savannah society who insisted on arriving precisely on time. Amy knew this well - Mrs. Hayes's disapproval could be as sharp as a pair of salon shears, and Amy wouldn’t dare disappoint her.  

But today, a strange unease prickled at the back of Amy's neck. It wasn't just the faint hum emanating from the antique gramophone playing soft jazz in the corner, nor the peculiar scent of lavender that clung to the air despite the absence of any lavender-scented products. There was something else, something she couldn’t quite place, a feeling like a whispered secret waiting to be unravelled.
