The humid Miami air clung to Eleanor Vance like a second skin as she surveyed her latest project: a gleaming Art Deco skyscraper poised on Biscayne Bay, its mirrored façade reflecting the vibrant sunset sky.  The construction was almost complete, and the building thrummed with a nervous energy – a symphony of clanging metal, whirring machinery, and shouted instructions in a dozen different languages. Eleanor, her blonde ponytail pulled back tight against the heat, adjusted her steel-toe boots on the scaffolding, feeling the familiar tremor of excitement course through her. This wasn't just another building; it was a phoenix rising from the ashes of Miami's past, a testament to the city's relentless drive towards the future. Yet, as she gazed out at the vast expanse of water stretching towards the horizon, Eleanor couldn't shake off a nagging feeling – a sense that something wasn't quite right.  The setting sun cast long shadows across the construction site, deepening the mystery in Eleanor's heart.
