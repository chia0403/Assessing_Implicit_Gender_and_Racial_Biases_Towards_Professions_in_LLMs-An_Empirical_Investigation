The sirens wailed like mournful banshees, a familiar soundtrack to Amelia "Amy" Bellweather's life.  She gripped the steering wheel of Ambulance 42, her knuckles white against the leather. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the city lights into streaks of amber and crimson. Another night on the streets of Chicago, another tapestry of human stories woven with pain and hope. 

Tonight, the call was a possible cardiac arrest in an alleyway near Wrigleyville.  Amy scanned her partner's face – Ben "Bear" Johnson, his brow furrowed with concern as he checked their equipment. They were veterans, both hardened by years on the front lines of life and death, yet still capable of being shaken by the sheer fragility of it all. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of rain-soaked asphalt and something else – a metallic tang that sent a shiver down Amy's spine. It was the smell of fear, raw and palpable. As they pulled up to the alleyway, the darkness seemed to press in on them, thick and suffocating. This wasn't just another call; this felt different, heavier.
