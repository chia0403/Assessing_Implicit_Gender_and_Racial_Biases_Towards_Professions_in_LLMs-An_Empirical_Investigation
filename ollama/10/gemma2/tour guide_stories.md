The midday sun beat down on Alora Evangeline Beaumont's neck as she surveyed the throng of tourists before her. A sticky sweat had already begun to form under her crisp white blouse, but she plastered on a smile wide enough to rival the Grand Canyon itself – their destination for this scorching afternoon trek.

Alora adjusted the microphone clipped to her lapel and her practiced cadence began: "Welcome, everyone, to the most awe-inspiring natural wonder in all of Arizona! The Grand Canyon... a breathtaking testament to the power of time..." Her voice boomed across the dusty parking lot, punctuated by the cries of excited children and the hum of tour bus engines. 

The air hung thick with the scent of sunscreen, dust, and anticipation. A sea of tourists from every corner of the globe milled about, clutching maps and water bottles, their faces a mixture of excitement and apprehension at the sheer immensity of the landscape before them. Alora felt a familiar thrill course through her – this was where she belonged, amidst these wide-eyed wanderers, sharing the magic of the Canyon with each curious soul. 


The setting: A dusty parking lot on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona.
