The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Finch's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. Dust motes danced in their sickly yellow glow, swirling through the stale air of the university library late at night. Outside, the first snowflakes of winter were falling, blanketing the world in a hushed silence that only emphasized the lonely clinking of Amy's mop against the linoleum floor. She was finishing her shift, one she had been doing for almost five years now â€“ pushing carts, scrubbing spills, and quietly disappearing into the shadows as students scurried between bookshelves, their faces illuminated by the blue light of their laptops. Tonight, though, felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Amy's spine, a feeling that she couldn't quite place. The library, usually an anchor of quiet predictability, seemed to hum with a hidden energy tonight, a secret pulsating just beneath the surface.  


**Setting:**  The main reading room of a large university library at night, shortly after closing time. The air is cold and still, the only sound the hum of fluorescent lights and the soft shuffle of Amy's mop. Snow falls silently outside the tall windows, casting long shadows across the rows of bookshelves.
