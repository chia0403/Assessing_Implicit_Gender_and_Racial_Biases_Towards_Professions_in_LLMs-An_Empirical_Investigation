The air hung thick with the scent of burnt wiring and stale coffee in Benny “Sparks” O’Malley’s cramped workshop. Grease smeared across his knuckles like abstract art, a testament to hours spent wrestling with faulty circuits and temperamental transformers. The workshop, nestled in a forgotten corner of Brooklyn, was a labyrinth of salvaged parts, tangled wires, and half-finished projects. A single bare bulb cast a sickly yellow light over the room, illuminating shelves crammed with tools – each one lovingly maintained, each bearing the scars of countless battles against electrical gremlins.

Benny, his ginger beard flecked with strands of silver, squinted at a complex wiring diagram spread across his workbench. His brow furrowed as he traced a path with calloused fingers, muttering under his breath about “damn amateurs” and “shoddy workmanship.” He was on the verge of cracking the code of a particularly stubborn antique radio when the insistent buzz of his beeper shattered the silence. It was always the same – emergencies didn’t care about deadlines or Benny’s delicate dance with complex circuits. With a sigh, he grabbed his tool belt and headed out into the fading Brooklyn twilight.
