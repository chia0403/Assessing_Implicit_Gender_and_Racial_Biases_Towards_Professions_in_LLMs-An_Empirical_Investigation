The flickering fluorescent lights of Meadowbrook High buzzed like agitated bees, casting a sickly yellow pallor over Principal Thompson's cluttered office. Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Beaumont, the school psychologist. She tapped her foot impatiently, the sound muffled by the thick carpet, and glanced at the clock for the tenth time in five minutes.

"Ten o'clock," she muttered under her breath. "Just another day, just another late arrival."  Eleanor was used to parents dragging their feet when it came to confronting issues with their children, but this particular case felt different. A hushed rumour had been circulating through the staff room â€“ whispers of a troubled student named Liam Carter, his behaviour escalating into something truly unsettling.

Liam's mother, Mrs. Sarah Carter, finally appeared at her office door, her face etched with a weariness that seemed to consume her entire being. The weight of worry was heavy in the air as she entered, leaving a trail of dampness and the scent of lavender perfume in her wake. 


Eleanor straightened in her chair, smoothing down her already impeccable skirt suit. "Mrs. Carter," she began, her voice calm and measured, "Thank you for coming in." 

The storm raged on outside, but inside Eleanor's office, a different kind of tempest was about to unfold.
