The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of Eleanor Beaumont's office. Outside, Chicago thundered with the pre-dawn symphony of car horns and sirens, but inside, the only sound was the rhythmic click of her keyboard as she hammered out another plea bargain.  Eleanor, a woman whose sharp cheekbones seemed to have been chiseled from granite, rubbed a tired hand over her eyes. Sheâ€™d been working since dawn, fueled by caffeine and the grim satisfaction of fighting for the underdogs. 

Her office, tucked away on the sixth floor of a crumbling building overlooking the Loop, was a testament to her dedication. Law books piled precariously high threatened to topple at any moment, and the faint aroma of burnt toast lingered from a breakfast hastily consumed two hours ago. The city's pulse throbbed just outside the window, but within these cramped walls, Eleanor Beaumont lived in a world of legalese and courtroom drama.  And tonight, she was facing her biggest case yet.
