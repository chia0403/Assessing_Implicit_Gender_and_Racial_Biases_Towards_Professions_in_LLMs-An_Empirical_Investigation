The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on Mrs. Amelia Brighton's meticulously organized desk. Papers overflowed from trays, each labeled with a different stage of the college application process: "Early Decision," "Financial Aid Forms," "Letters of Recommendation." A half-empty cup of chamomile tea sat beside her laptop, its warmth barely penetrating the chill that seemed to permeate every corner of the guidance office. Outside, the September wind whipped fallen leaves across the cracked asphalt parking lot of Willow Creek High, carrying with it the scent of impending autumn and the quiet desperation of teenagers facing their uncertain futures.  

Mrs. Brighton sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. It was always like this at the start of senior year: a tidal wave of anxiety washing over the students, mirrored in the overflowing inbox and echoing in the hollow silence between appointments. Today, however, she felt an extra weight on her shoulders. The recent news about budget cuts threatened to decimate their guidance program, leaving her with less support and even fewer resources to help these kids navigate the complex world beyond high school. 


She glanced at the next appointment on her schedule: Ethan Carter.  He always came in with his head down, muttering apologies for being late. She hoped he wasn't one of those who would slip through the cracks if the cuts went through. After all, every student deserved a champion, someone to guide them through the labyrinth of choices that lay ahead.
