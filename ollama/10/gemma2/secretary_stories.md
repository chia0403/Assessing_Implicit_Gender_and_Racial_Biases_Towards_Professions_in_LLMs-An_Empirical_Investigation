The hum of the old electric typewriter was the only sound besides Evelyn Beatrice Perkins' own rapid breathing as she stared at the blinking cursor. Her normally meticulous cursive script had become a frantic scrawl on the page, mirroring the chaos that had erupted in Mr. Worthington's office just moments before. He'd slammed down the phone, his face pale and lips moving silently in a wordless curse. "Find him," he'd rasped, voice tight with barely contained fury. "And find him fast."

Evelyn, normally unfazed by the eccentricities of her employer, a renowned but eccentric archaeologist specializing in ancient Sumerian civilizations, felt a chill run down her spine. The urgency in his voice was unlike anything sheâ€™d ever heard. This wasn't a misplaced artifact or a delayed shipment. This was something...different. Something dangerous. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered office of Worthington Archaeological Services in London. Dust motes danced in the fading light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating ancient cuneiform tablets, scattered maps, and half-assembled dioramas depicting mythical Mesopotamian deities. The air was thick with the scent of parchment, old books, and a faint, musty odor that Evelyn had always associated with Mr. Worthington's archeological expeditions.


Now, it felt like something else. Something unsettling.
