The air in Eloise Penelope Beaumont's workshop hung heavy with the scent of silk and beeswax. Threads of lavender and dusty rose snaked across her worktable like delicate, unfinished gardens. Outside, the sun dipped below the rooftops of London, casting long shadows across cobblestone streets slick with a recent rain.  A single gas lamp flickered beside Eloise's workbench, illuminating the intricate embroidery she was painstakingly adding to a bodice destined for Lady Cavendish's upcoming debut at court. 


Eloise hummed softly, her needle dancing in and out of the fabric. Despite the quiet satisfaction of her work, a gnawing anxiety twisted in her stomach.  Tomorrow was the day Lord Ashworth, a notoriously demanding fashion patron, would arrive for his fitting. His request: a gown unlike any other, daring, revolutionary, something that would turn heads and ignite whispers at the grand ball he planned to host. 


Eloise's fingers tightened around the needle. Could she truly create something that bold? Something that would satisfy Lord Ashworth's insatiable desire for novelty? The weight of expectation pressed down on her, heavier than any bolt of fabric she had ever handled.
