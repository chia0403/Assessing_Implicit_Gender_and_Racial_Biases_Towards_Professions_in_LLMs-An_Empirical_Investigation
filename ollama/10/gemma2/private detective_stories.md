The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and cheap perfume, a heady concoction that usually wouldn't bother Alistair Finch, but tonight it felt like an unwelcome assault on his already frayed nerves. He sat hunched in his dimly lit office, perched precariously on a threadbare armchair salvaged from a forgotten flea market. Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes, casting flickering shadows across the worn maps and faded photographs plastered haphazardly on the walls. His desk, perpetually cluttered with half-eaten takeout containers, crumpled case files, and overflowing ashtrays, mirrored the chaos swirling within him. 

Alistair Finch, a name that once held promise, now felt more like a relic of a past life. A past where he'd been known as "Ace" - sharp, witty, and always one step ahead. Now, he was just Alistair, drowning in a sea of forgotten cases and mounting bills. 


Then, the door creaked open, interrupting his grim contemplation.  A woman stood framed in the doorway, silhouetted against the flickering neon sign outside. She wore a crimson dress that clung to her curves like a second skin, her dark eyes burning with a desperate intensity. She was everything Alistair had tried to leave behind â€“ glamour, intrigue, and danger intertwined in one alluring package. 

"Mr. Finch?" she asked, her voice a husky whisper that sent a shiver down his spine. "I need your help."
