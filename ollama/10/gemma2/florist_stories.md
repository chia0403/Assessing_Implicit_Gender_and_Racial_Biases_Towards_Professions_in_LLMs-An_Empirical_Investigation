The bell above the door chimed a cheerful welcome as Elara Thistlewood surveyed her shop, "Petal & Plume." Sunlight streamed through the large window, illuminating the vibrant chaos: lilies towering in porcelain vases, velvety roses blushing in shades of crimson and apricot, and delicate sprigs of lavender cascading over an antique chest. 

Elara's fingers brushed against a pot of plump marigolds, their orange petals promising warmth amidst the late autumn chill creeping into the air of her quaint corner shop nestled on cobblestone Rose Street, nestled within the bustling heart of Edinburgh.  A city draped in history and shrouded in mist, Edinburgh held a magic that mirrored the very essence of Elara's work â€“ transforming moments with the potent alchemy of blossoms. 


But today, a peculiar stillness hung in the air, a quiet that even the chirping sparrows outside couldn't penetrate.  Elara frowned, instinctively feeling the shift in the atmosphere before hearing the soft rasping cough from the back of the shop. Her heart skipped a beat. She had been alone all morning.
