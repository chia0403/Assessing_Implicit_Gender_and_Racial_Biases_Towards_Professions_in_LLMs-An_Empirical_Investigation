The sun beat down on Elias Thorne's back like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat trickling down his temple and stinging his eyes. He squinted through the haze, watching the tar shingles melt under his trowel. Below him, the city of New Haven sprawled like a rumpled map, its buildings baking in the summer heat. The air hung thick with the smell of asphalt and exhaust fumes, punctuated by the distant clang of a subway train. Elias wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. He was used to the heat, the grit, the endless climb. It was in his blood, passed down from his father, who'd taught him everything he knew about roofing under this very sun.  But today, something felt different. Today, Elias couldn't shake the feeling that the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen. 


And as a rogue gust of wind whipped through the canyons of steel and glass, sending a shiver down his spine, Elias knew he was right. Whatever came next, it wouldnâ€™t be good.
