The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and granite dust in Elias Blackwood's workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing above the workbench where Elias hunched, his face creased with concentration as he chiseled away at a block of rough jade. The rhythmic clang of his hammer echoed through the cavernous space, punctuated by the occasional rasp of his file against stone.  

Elias, a man weathered like granite itself by years spent working with it, ran a calloused thumb over the smooth curve he'd just created. This piece was different - a swirling pattern meant to mimic the aurora borealis heâ€™d glimpsed only once, as a boy, high in the mountains above their village of Aethelwood. 

He lived on a small farm nestled at the edge of the village, his workshop a ramshackle extension built from salvaged timber and stone salvaged from his quarry. The farmhouse itself was old, its timbers creaking with age, but it held warmth within its walls - warmth Elias had cultivated through years of hard work and solitude.  


But today, a chill snaked down his spine, unbidden and unsettling. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss, that the familiar rhythm of his life was about to be shattered. A premonition as sharp as the edge of his chisel settled in his gut, whispering of change, of danger lurking just beyond the horizon of his quiet world.
