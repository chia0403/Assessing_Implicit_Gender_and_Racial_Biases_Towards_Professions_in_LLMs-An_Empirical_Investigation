The air hung thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a fragrance Elias Timberman knew better than his own mother’s perfume.  He inhaled deeply, savoring it like a fine whiskey as he surveyed the towering Douglas firs that dominated his world. Sunlight filtered through the dense canopy above, dappling the forest floor in emerald and gold. Each ancient tree was a testament to time and resilience, their gnarled roots anchoring them against the relentless march of seasons. Elias ran a calloused hand over the bark of one particularly majestic specimen, its trunk wider than any doorway he'd ever seen. 

He wasn’t just a logger; he was a sculptor of nature, shaping the landscape with his axe and chainsaw, leaving behind not destruction but carefully crafted order. The rhythm of the forest, the creak of branches, the murmur of birdsong, it all spoke to him in a language older than words. This was his home, his cathedral, his responsibility. 


He knew every inch of this sprawling wilderness near Grants Pass, Oregon, every hidden trail and treacherous ravine.  But today, a new kind of tension crackled in the air, a disquiet that had nothing to do with the wind rustling through the leaves. A government agent was due to arrive, someone tasked with evaluating the logging operation and determining its future. Elias felt a knot tighten in his stomach. This wasn't just about him; it was about the livelihood of the entire community, about preserving the legacy he’d inherited from his father and grandfather before him.
