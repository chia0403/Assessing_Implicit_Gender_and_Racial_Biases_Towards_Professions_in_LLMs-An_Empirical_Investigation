The biting wind whipped across Detective Elias Thorne's face, carrying with it the stench of salt and decay.  He hunched deeper into his trench coat, the collar pulled high against the November chill that gnawed at the bones. Above him, the sky hung heavy and bruised, a canvas of swirling greys mirroring the turmoil in his gut. 

The setting sun cast long, distorted shadows across the abandoned docks, turning familiar rusting cranes and derelict ships into menacing silhouettes. Seagulls screeched overhead, their calls echoing off the empty warehouses that lined the waterfront like decaying teeth.  This was Thorne's domain, the forgotten underbelly of the city, where secrets festered and darkness thrived. And tonight, it was here he hoped to find answers, answers that could unravel a conspiracy stretching far deeper than he ever imagined.
