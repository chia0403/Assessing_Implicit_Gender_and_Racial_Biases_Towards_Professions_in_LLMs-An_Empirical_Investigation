The air hung thick with the smell of gasoline and burnt oil, a familiar comfort to Amelia "Millie" Hayes. Grease stained her overalls, smudged across her forehead, a badge of honor earned through countless hours hunched over engines. Her small garage, tucked away on a forgotten side street in Providence, Rhode Island, was more than just a business; it was her sanctuary, a haven from the chaotic symphony of city life.

The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows, casting long shadows across the tools strewn across workbenches. Millie's calloused fingers traced the curve of a worn spark plug, its metal cool beneath her touch.  She hummed softly, a tuneless melody that echoed in the cavernous space, as she diagnosed the persistent cough emanating from the vintage Ford Mustang parked on the lift. Outside, the city pulsed with life, but here, amidst the whirring of tools and the rhythmic clang of metal, time seemed to stand still.
