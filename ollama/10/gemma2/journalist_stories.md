The flickering neon sign outside "The Rusty Mug" cast an unsteady glow on Amelia Rose Cartwright's trench coat as she pushed open the door. The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke and the murmur of hushed conversations â€“ a familiar comfort in the grimy underbelly of New Orleans. 

Amelia, known to most as Rosie, wasn't here for the ambiance. She was here for information. A tip had led her to this dimly lit bar, a haven for the city's forgotten souls and whispered secrets. Her target: Frankie "Fingers" Marino, a notorious bootlegger with connections that ran deeper than the murky waters of the bayou. Rosie needed his help to crack open a story, one that threatened to expose the corruption festering at the heart of the city's political elite.  


As she took her place at the bar, nursing a lukewarm beer, Rosie felt the familiar tug of danger. New Orleans was a city where shadows danced with secrets and truth often came at a price. Tonight, she was willing to pay it.
