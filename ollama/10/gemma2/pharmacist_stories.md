The bell above the door tinkled its familiar melody as Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright straightened a row of cough syrup bottles, her brow furrowing ever so slightly at the unwelcome intrusion. The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of "Cartwright's Apothecary," casting long shadows across the crammed shelves stacked high with jars of dried herbs, bottles filled with colorful tinctures, and ancient tomes on herbal remedies. It wasn't a bustling kind of day, more like a slow simmer, the air thick with the scent of lavender and peppermint. Eleanor preferred it that way. The quiet hum of the antique apothecary scale in the corner was her usual soundtrack, punctuated only by the occasional cough or sniffle from a customer seeking relief.  

Today, however, the chime of the bell brought a disruption to her peaceful routine. 


The man who entered held himself with an air of urgency, his coat rumpled and his eyes darting around the cluttered shop as if searching for something specific. He was young, maybe early twenties, with hair the color of wheat and a face that seemed weathered beyond his years.  Eleanor's hand instinctively went to the worn velvet pouch hanging from her apron string, where she kept a small collection of peppermint candies, often offered to soothe anxious customers. This one, though, didn't seem in need of sweet relief. He looked like he was running on fumes and desperation.
