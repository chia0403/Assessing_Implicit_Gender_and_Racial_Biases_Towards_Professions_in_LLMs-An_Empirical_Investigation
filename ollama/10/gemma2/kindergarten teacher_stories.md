The air hung thick with the scent of crayons and disinfectant, a familiar perfume that always seemed to cling to Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Butterfield's coattails.  Her classroom, affectionately dubbed "Rainbow Room" by its tiny inhabitants, was a kaleidoscope of color: walls painted in swirling rainbows, hand-drawn murals depicting fantastical creatures, and alphabet letters strung across the ceiling like playful spiderwebs. But today, amidst the usual joyous chaos, an undercurrent of unease buzzed beneath the surface.  Ms. Butterfield, a woman who usually met every sticky hand and misplaced backpack with a smile as bright as the sunflowers on her bulletin board, felt a knot tightening in her stomach. Something was different. 


The source of her discomfort became apparent as soon as she saw Timmy Parker, the quietest child in the class, standing by the window, his back rigidly straight, staring out at the playground with an unreadable expression on his usually cherubic face. He wasn't crying, not exactly. More like...withholding tears.   His tiny fists were clenched so tightly that his knuckles had turned white. This was not Timmy. Something was deeply wrong.
