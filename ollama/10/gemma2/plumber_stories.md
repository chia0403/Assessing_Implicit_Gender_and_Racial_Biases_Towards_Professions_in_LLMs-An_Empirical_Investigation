The incessant drip echoed through Amelia "Amy" Butterfield's bones as surely as it did through the hollow pipes of the ancient Victorian bathroom.  A rhythmic beat against the silence of pre-dawn, a metronome marking time until she could finally drown out the noise with the clattering symphony of her tools.

She stood in the cramped space, flashlight beam dancing across cracked porcelain and peeling wallpaper. A thick layer of grime coated every surface, testament to years of neglect and the unfortunate plumbing choices of its original owners.  Amy wasn't one for judging past inhabitants, but this bathroom was a textbook case of "what not to do" when it came to waterworks. The leaky faucet, a gushing wound on the ancient brass, was only the tip of the iceberg. 

Outside the window, the sky above Newhaven shimmered with pre-dawn hues â€“ streaks of pink and orange bleeding into a soft blue.  The air held the crisp promise of a new day, a stark contrast to the dank, stagnant atmosphere within the bathroom. Amy sighed, tightening her wrench around the faucet's stem. This was going to be a long one.
