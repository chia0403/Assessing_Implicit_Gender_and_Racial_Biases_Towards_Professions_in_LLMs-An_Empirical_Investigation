The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation.  It clung to Elias Blackwood like a second skin, seeping into his pores with every shift at The Rusty Bucket. Neon signs flickered erratically outside, casting sickly green shadows across the worn linoleum floor. Inside, the usual Wednesday night crowd was thinning out - a motley crew of regulars nursing grievances in lukewarm pints and faded dreams. 

Elias wiped down a sticky table, his gaze drifting towards the lone figure hunched over a half-empty glass at the bar. He couldn't quite make out her face, hidden beneath a wide-brimmed hat that cast an air of mystery. She seemed lost in thought, a symphony of loneliness playing out in the clinking of ice against glass.  Elias knew that feeling all too well. 


The bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of another patron. Elias straightened his already impeccable bowtie and braced himself for another night of serving up smiles alongside cheap drinks.
