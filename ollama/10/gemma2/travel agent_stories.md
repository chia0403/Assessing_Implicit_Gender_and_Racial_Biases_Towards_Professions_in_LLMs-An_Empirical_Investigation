The air in Amelia Brighton's office hummed with the low thrum of a forgotten vacation playlist – something about ukulele serenades and crashing waves that no longer held any charm for her. She stared out at the bustling cityscape beyond her window, its usual vibrancy dulled by the grey, drizzle-laden sky mirroring her own mood.  

Amelia Brighton, Queen of Escapes as she’d jokingly titled herself on her outdated website, hadn't escaped anything lately. Not even a single weekend getaway to rejuvenate her weary soul. Business had been slow since the pandemic, and the travel bug that once pulsed through her veins seemed to have finally gone dormant. Her office, a haven of travel brochures, half-folded maps, and souvenirs collected from far-flung corners of the world, now felt more like a tomb for forgotten dreams.  
 
The only sound besides the melancholic music was the steady click-clack of her keyboard as she scrolled through yet another email detailing budget cuts. Her phone vibrated on her desk, pulling her back to reality. It was a notification from an online travel forum: "Help! Cancelled flight in Bali – need immediate alternative!" 


Amelia sighed. Even when clients weren't directly seeking her expertise, she couldn’t seem to escape the allure of the open road, even if it was just vicariously through their desperate pleas. Perhaps this could be the spark she needed.
