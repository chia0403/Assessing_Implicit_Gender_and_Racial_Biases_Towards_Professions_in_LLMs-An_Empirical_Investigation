Rain lashed against the glass, mirroring the frantic drumming of Bea’s fingers on the worn keys of her ancient computer.

A gnawing unease had settled over Bea like a damp fog. She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was off, that this year's tax season held more than just its usual share of anxieties and unexpected deductions.
