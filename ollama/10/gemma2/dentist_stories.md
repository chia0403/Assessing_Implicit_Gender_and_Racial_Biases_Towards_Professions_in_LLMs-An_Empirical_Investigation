The fluorescent lights hummed over Dr. Evelyn Beatrice Finch's waiting room, casting a sickly yellow pallor across the faded floral wallpaper. The air hung thick with the sterile scent of antiseptic and anxiety.  

Evelyn watched the seconds tick by on the antique clock perched above the fireplace, its brass pendulum swinging in a hypnotic rhythm. Her practice, tucked away on a quiet side street in Oakhaven, was usually bustling at this hour. But today, only one patient dared venture within its walls - Mrs. Mildred Peabody, clutching a handkerchief and staring nervously at her worn-out tennis shoes. 

Oakhaven wasn't exactly teeming with excitement. It was a town where gossip spread faster than wildfire and the biggest news item in recent months was the annual pie competition, won by Evelyn's aunt Beatrice for the tenth year running. But behind the quiet facade, there were whispers of something darker lurking beneath the surface. Whispers that had begun just last week, swirling around the disappearance of a local teenager named Thomas Bell. 


Evelyn knew she should focus on filling Mrs. Peabodyâ€™s cavities and not waste her time with idle gossip. But something about the unease in the air, the strange silence hanging over Oakhaven, pricked at her conscience. Perhaps it was just the unsettling tick of that old clock, but Evelyn felt an icy certainty: this town held a secret, and she had a feeling it would soon find its way into her dental practice.
