The air in "Shiny & New," the local appliance store, hung thick with the scent of ozone and desperation.  Rain lashed against the glass storefront, blurring the neon sign that flickered erratically: "Summer Sale! Savings You Can't Refuse!"  It was the kind of downpour that made people crave warm kitchens and steaming mugs of tea, things Theodore Bartholomew "Teddy" Prescott hoped to sell them today.

Teddy wiped his brow with a grimy handkerchief, the dampness clinging to his already sweat-slicked forehead. He adjusted his ill-fitting tie - a vibrant crimson monstrosity that clashed spectacularly with his pale blue shirt - and surveyed the sparsely populated showroom floor. Two elderly women huddled by the coffee maker display, their expressions grim as they weighed the pros and cons of a stainless steel model versus one in muted beige. A young couple, arms crossed and looking decidedly unhappy, argued over the merits of a top-loading versus a front-loading washer. 

Teddy sighed. It was going to be another long day.
