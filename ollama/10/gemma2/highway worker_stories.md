The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck like a hammer, each clang reverberating through his bones. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already shimmering landscape of asphalt ribboning across the Mojave Desert.  He tugged at the brim of his worn baseball cap, offering scant relief from the relentless glare. His gloved hand gripped the heavy rake, its teeth scraping against the unforgiving ground, collecting loose gravel and bits of shattered glass that dotted the highway's shoulder like forgotten dreams. 

The air hung thick with the scent of dust, diesel, and a distant hint of sagebrush. The only sounds were the rhythmic rasp of Silas's rake and the occasional rumble of a semi-truck roaring by on the seemingly endless ribbon of blacktop.  He felt the familiar ache in his back, a constant companion since he'd taken this job ten years ago, a testament to the unforgiving nature of his work.

Silas wasn't just a highway worker; he was a guardian of sorts, keeping this fragile artery of civilization flowing smoothly, patching up the wounds inflicted by careless drivers and the relentless desert winds. He knew every bump, every curve, every patch of faded asphalt like the lines on his own weathered hand.


This stretch of Highway 95, between Barstow and Las Vegas, was his domain, a lonely kingdom where he traded in solitude for the satisfaction of a job well done.
