The scent of rain-soaked asphalt and blooming lilacs hung heavy in the air, a discordant harmony that mirrored Dr. Eleanor Vance's mood. Rain lashed against the windows of her office, blurring the already hazy cityscape beyond. She sat at her desk, staring at the worn leather cover of a self-help book titled "How to Deal with Anxiety" â€“ a cruel irony considering her own swirling anxieties were about to spiral into full-blown panic.  

Eleanor's mind raced, replaying the phone call she had just received from the hospital. Her patient, Arthur Finch, a young man she'd been counseling for his obsessive-compulsive disorder, had attempted suicide. He was now in critical condition and fighting for his life. 


The city lights flickered through the rain-streaked glass, casting an unsettling glow over Eleanor's face. She felt the familiar tug of responsibility, the heavy weight of another soul teetering on the edge of despair, a weight she had sworn to help carry. But tonight, as the storm raged outside and her own anxieties threatened to engulf her, she wasn't sure if she was strong enough to bear it alone.
