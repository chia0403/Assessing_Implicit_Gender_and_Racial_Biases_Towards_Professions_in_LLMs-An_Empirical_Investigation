The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and damp earth, a familiar aroma to Seraphina Bellweather, Guard Captain of Oakhaven's Western Wall. Her worn leather armor creaked as she shifted, her gaze scanning the endless expanse of forest that pressed against the stone ramparts.  The last rays of sun bled through the canopy, casting long, eerie shadows that danced with the whispers of the wind.

Oakhaven, a bustling town nestled in a verdant valley, was renowned for its vibrant markets and skilled artisans. But beyond the protective embrace of its walls lay the untamed wilderness, a realm teeming with both wonder and danger. Tonight, as the moon hung like a watchful eye in the darkening sky, Seraphina felt a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.  Something wasn't right.  The usual nocturnal chorus of crickets and owls was muted, replaced by an unsettling silence that amplified every creak of the wall and rustle of leaves. 


"Captain," a young guard named Rhys approached, his face pale in the fading light. "We have reports from the southern watchtower. They saw… movement."

Seraphina's grip tightened on the hilt of her sword. "Movement?" she asked, her voice low and steady. 

Rhys swallowed nervously. "They couldn't make it out clearly. But something large, with glowing eyes." 


The hairs on the back of Seraphina’s neck stood on end. This was no ordinary night patrol. Something dark and dangerous was lurking in the shadows beyond Oakhaven's walls, and she was its only barrier.
