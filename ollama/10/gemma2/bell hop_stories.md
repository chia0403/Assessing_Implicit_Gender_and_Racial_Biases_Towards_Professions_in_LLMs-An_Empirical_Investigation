The velvet ropes snaked across the marble lobby like crimson serpents, keeping the throngs of tourists from encroaching on the opulent expanse.  A faint scent of lilies mingled with the cloying sweetness of expensive perfume as Bartholomew “Barty” Sterling weaved through the bustling crowd. He expertly maneuvered a rolling luggage cart piled high with mismatched bags, his eyes scanning for his next assignment. The Grand Majestic Hotel in New Orleans was Barty's kingdom, its gilded cage housing stories whispered and secrets tucked away like trinkets in forgotten corners.

Barty adjusted his crisp white jacket, the hotel's uniform sitting comfortably on his lean frame. He'd been a bell hop here for five years, navigating the labyrinthine corridors and eavesdropping on the dramas unfolding within its walls. He knew every nook and cranny, every resident's quirk, and every shadow that danced with the flickering gas lamps. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the humid Louisiana night.  Barty couldn't quite place it, but a storm was brewing, both within the hotel and beyond its grand facade. As he spotted Mrs. Delacroix, a regular guest with a penchant for melodrama, clutching a telegram with a trembling hand, Barty knew this storm was about to break.
