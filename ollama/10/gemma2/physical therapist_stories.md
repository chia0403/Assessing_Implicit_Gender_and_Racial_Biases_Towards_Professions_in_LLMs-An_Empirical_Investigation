The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of lavender essential oil, creating a sterile yet strangely comforting atmosphere.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows of Amelia Beatrice "Mia" Harper's small therapy practice, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Outside, the vibrant green of spring stretched across the manicured lawns of the suburban neighbourhood, but inside, Mia’s focus remained laser-sharp on her patient, a stoic older gentleman named Arthur who sat before her, his face creased with tension as he grimaced through each movement. 


“Come on, Arthur,” Mia coaxed gently, her voice laced with warmth and encouragement. “Just a little further.” She demonstrated the shoulder rotation exercise again, her movements fluid and precise. "Remember, slow and controlled. We're not trying to win a race here."

Arthur grunted in response, his eyes fixed on his hands as he struggled to replicate her movement. The pain was evident in his clenched jaw, but Mia knew beneath that frustration lay a flicker of determination – a desire to reclaim the ease and mobility he’d lost after his fall.
