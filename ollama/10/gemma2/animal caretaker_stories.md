The pungent scent of hay and damp earth clung to Elara Wrenwood like a second skin. Her boots crunched on the frost-covered ground as she traversed the cobblestone path towards the stables, the rising sun casting long shadows across the dew-kissed fields of Meadowbrook Animal Sanctuary. The air was crisp with the promise of a cold winter day, and wisps of smoke curled lazily from the chimneys of the nearby farmhouse, hinting at the warmth within.

Elara was responsible for the sanctuary's menagerie: rescued horses with scarred flanks and gentle eyes, orphaned lambs that nuzzled against her hand, and a mischievous pack of foxes who seemed to delight in stealing stray carrots.  But today, a new arrival awaited her - a creature unlike any she had ever encountered before. A whispered rumor, carried on the wind from the bustling city, spoke of a mythical beast, injured and alone, seeking refuge at Meadowbrook's gates. Elara, with her unwavering compassion for all creatures, couldn't resist answering its call.
