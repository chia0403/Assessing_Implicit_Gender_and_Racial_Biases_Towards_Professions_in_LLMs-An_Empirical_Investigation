The sunrise bled across the horizon, painting the dew-laden cornfields in hues of apricot and rose. It was the kind of dawn that promised a good day, the air crisp and clean, the chirping of birds a joyful chorus. But for Elias Hawthorne, the promise felt hollow. 

Elias stood at the edge of his field, his weathered hands clasped behind his back. His boots sank slightly into the moist earth, each step leaving a faint imprint. He squinted at the rows of corn, his gaze traveling over the lush green stalks like a hawk surveying its prey. It was his father's legacy, this farm nestled in the heart of Iowa. Three generations had tilled these lands, and Elias had always dreamt of carrying on that tradition. But now, the weight of responsibility felt crushing. The drought last summer had taken its toll, leaving behind parched soil and meager yields.  

The worry etched itself into his face - a network of fine lines around his eyes and mouth, emphasizing the hollowness in his gaze.  He wasn't just worried about this season; he was worried about the future. Would the farm survive another year? Another drought? The thought gnawed at him, a constant shadow lurking behind every sunrise.
