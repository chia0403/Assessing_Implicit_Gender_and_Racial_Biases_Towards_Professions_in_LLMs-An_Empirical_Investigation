The humid Georgia air clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin as he wrestled another oak sapling into the ground. Sweat beaded on his forehead, tracing a path through the dust that coated his worn baseball cap. His muscles burned with the familiar ache of honest labor, but a smile played on his lips. He loved this – transforming barren patches of earth into vibrant oases. 

Elias Thorne & Sons Landscaping was his legacy, passed down from his grandfather who'd instilled in him a deep respect for the land and the art of nurturing it. Elias had inherited his grandfather's calloused hands, his quiet determination, and a touch of his stubbornness when it came to coaxing life out of even the most reluctant soil. Today's job was at the sprawling estate of Mrs. Evangeline Hawthorne, a woman known for her demanding nature and impeccable taste. Elias hoped his meticulous plan would impress her, but he knew judging him wasn't solely based on aesthetics. She valued sustainability and an understanding of the delicate balance within the ecosystem – things Elias held dear. He took a deep breath, inhaled the earthy scent of freshly turned soil, and surveyed the canvas before him.  

The Hawthorne estate was a sprawling testament to old money, with manicured lawns that stretched as far as the eye could see and ancient trees whispering secrets in the breeze. A grand manor house stood at its center, casting long shadows across the vibrant flower beds Elias had begun planting earlier this week. But beyond the manicured perfection, he sensed a hidden sadness in the sprawling grounds, a longing for something more.  

Elias Thorne was about to give it to her.
