The engine of Bessie, a 1985 Peterbilt 359 affectionately nicknamed "Old Reliable," rumbled like a contented beast as Elijah Silas Thornton navigated the endless ribbon of asphalt that was I-70.  Outside, the Nevada desert stretched out before him, a shimmering canvas of ochre and burnt orange under a sky vast and unforgiving. The sun beat down relentlessly, turning Bessie's chrome into an oven, and the air hung thick with the scent of diesel and sagebrush. 

Elijah felt the familiar thrum of the road beneath his worn boots as he gripped the steering wheel, his gaze fixed on the distant horizon. This stretch was always lonely, but Elijah found comfort in its solitude. He was a man of few words, content in his own company and the steady rhythm of the highway.  

He'd been hauling freight for over two decades, crisscrossing the country from coast to coast, delivering everything from farm equipment to furniture to the occasional load of highly classified government cargo. He knew every rest stop between Denver and Los Angeles by heart, every truck stop waitress with a weary smile, every stretch of road that whispered secrets in the wind.  But this trip felt different.  A gnawing unease sat heavy in his gut, a feeling he couldn't shake.
