The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Evelyn Thorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the stark interview room. Rain lashed against the reinforced glass window behind her, mimicking the storm brewing within the man seated opposite her. His hands, calloused and roughened by years of manual labor, were clenched tight, knuckles white against his worn leather jacket.  

Evelyn, a forensic psychologist with a reputation for seeing through the facades people meticulously constructed, knew he wasn't just agitated; he was terrified. A deep furrow etched itself between his brows, betraying the carefully crafted mask of indifference he tried to maintain. He was Daniel "Danny" Hayes, a carpenter accused of arson, and Evelyn was tasked with determining if he was truly capable of such an act.

The air in the room felt thick with unspoken words, accusations hanging heavy like the scent of damp earth clinging to Danny's jacket. Outside, the wind howled, mirroring the turmoil churning within him. 


**Setting:** A cramped, utilitarian interview room in a police station on the outskirts of Boston, Massachusetts. The rain is relentless outside, adding to the sense of claustrophobia and tension inside the room.
