The humid Georgia air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain as Amelia "Amy" Bellweather adjusted her floral-print dress and smoothed down her signature red lipstick. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty gravel driveway of Mrs. Hazelbrook's ramshackle farmhouse, highlighting the peeling paint and overgrown weeds. Amy had been an insurance agent for fifteen years, navigating the sticky world of claims and policies with a practiced ease, but this particular house held a peculiar uneasiness that prickled at her skin. 


Mrs. Hazelbrook was notorious in their small town, known as much for her eccentric behavior as for her fiercely independent spirit. Her claim? A swarm of unusually large bees had descended upon her prize-winning pumpkin patch, destroying every single gourd and leaving behind only buzzing wreckage. Amy, skeptical yet determined to offer a solution (and potentially avoid another visit from Sheriff Thompson who seemed to find Hazelbrook's antics endlessly amusing), took a deep breath and stepped onto the porch. The rusted screen door screeched open, revealing an interior shrouded in shadows and the smell of lavender incense.
