The air in Professor Evelyn Alistair's office was thick with the scent of aged paper and pipe tobacco, a comforting aroma that usually calmed her nerves. But today, the familiar smells did little to quell the storm brewing within her. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her small, cluttered office overlooking the sprawling quad at Blackwood University, mirroring the tempestuous mood churning inside her. 

Blackwood was an ancient institution, its gothic architecture whispering tales of bygone eras and buried secrets. Nestled in a forgotten corner of Scotland, shrouded in mist and folklore, it had always been Evelyn's sanctuary, a place where she could lose herself in the dusty tomes and intricate histories housed within its hallowed halls. 

Now, however, the familiar comfort felt more like a gilded cage. A cryptic letter, delivered just hours ago by a hooded figure, threatened to unravel everything she held dear. Its contents hinted at a long-dormant conspiracy, one that reached into the very heart of Blackwood, potentially putting her life – and the lives of those around her – in grave danger.
