The scent of lemon polish clung to Eloise Amelia Butterfield like a second skin. It was her armor, her weapon against the dust bunnies that dared to gather under the grand piano in the drawing room, the faint grime on the antique silver tea set, and the invisible film of life that settled over everything in this sprawling Victorian mansion.  

Eloise, or Elsie as she preferred, had been tending to this chaotic beauty for twenty years, ever since Mrs. Davenport had hired her fresh out of finishing school. Twenty years of polishing mahogany, pressing linens, and listening to the hushed whispers of history echoing through these halls. The house itself was a character, a silent observer to the dramas played out within its walls – joyous celebrations, bitter arguments, whispered secrets, and silent griefs.

Elsie knew the creaks of each floorboard, the way the sunlight slanted through the stained-glass windows at dawn, and the precise order in which Mrs. Davenport's china was displayed on the sideboard. She was a part of this house, as much as the faded tapestries on the walls or the worn velvet upholstery. And just like them, she held onto its secrets with a quiet dignity.


But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unfamiliar tension, and Elsie could feel it in her bones – something was about to change.
