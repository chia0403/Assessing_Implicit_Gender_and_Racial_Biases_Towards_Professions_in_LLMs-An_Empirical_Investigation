The midday sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Brighton's back as she hunched over her laptop, parked precariously on the cracked pavement outside the bustling coffee shop. Inside, the air buzzed with chatter and the whir of the espresso machine – a comforting soundtrack to Amy's frantic work session. Her latest client, a high-end bakery called "Crumb & Co.", was demanding revisions for their new website design. Again.

Amy sighed, running a hand through her messy bun. This wasn't what she had envisioned when she’d moved from the bustling heart of London to the sleepy coastal town of Port Haven six months ago. She craved the calm, the slower pace, the salty air – all things she found in abundance here.  But the freelance life was a rollercoaster. 

Port Haven was picturesque, with its cobblestone streets, quaint cottages and vibrant harbour, but it was decidedly low on high-profile clients. The bakery website wasn't exactly groundbreaking – more "rustic charm" than cutting edge – and Amy couldn’t help but feel a pang of dissatisfaction.  Maybe she had been too idealistic. Maybe there was no escaping the relentless demands of her profession, even in paradise.

As a seagull squawked overhead, interrupting her thoughts, Amy took a deep breath. It was time to face the music.  She needed to get this website right, and she needed to do it quickly.
