The humid Manila air hung heavy as Elara "Ellie" Santiago pushed open the swinging door to the "Daily Kwentuhan," the city's most notorious gossip rag. A cacophony of clattering keyboards, ringing phones, and boisterous voices greeted her, a familiar symphony she could navigate blindfolded after five years on the beat. The cramped newsroom was bathed in the sickly yellow glow of fluorescent lights, casting long shadows across overflowing ashtrays and coffee-stained desks. Ellie slipped into her usual corner, the one with the flickering fan that perpetually battled the stifling heat. 

She grabbed a lukewarm cup of "kape" from the communal pot – a potent blend strong enough to wake the dead – and scanned the headlines splashed across the bulletin board: "Celebrity Love Triangle," "Politician Caught in Scandal," "New Vampire Panic Grips District 8." It was just another Tuesday.  

But today, a new article stood out, stark against the usual sensationalism. A single sentence, typed in bold letters: "The Ghost of Malacañang Returns." Ellie felt a shiver run down her spine. The legendary presidential palace, said to be haunted by the spirits of past leaders, was now supposedly active again. This wasn't just another gossip story. This had potential. 


This was a story she needed to chase.
