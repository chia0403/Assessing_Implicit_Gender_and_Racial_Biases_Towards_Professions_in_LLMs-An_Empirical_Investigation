The air hung thick with sawdust and the scent of pine. Elias Bartholomew "Eli" Blackwood wiped sweat from his brow, squinting through the haze that swirled around him in his small workshop. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the golden beams. Eli ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of the half-finished rocking chair, its curves echoing the graceful bend of an old willow tree on his grandfather's farm.  

He was lost in the rhythm of his work, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer against wood a familiar lullaby. Outside, the bustling market square thrummed with life â€“ hawkers shouting their wares, children chasing stray dogs, and the clatter of horse hooves on cobblestones. But inside Eli's workshop, time seemed to slow. Here, surrounded by the comforting weight of timber and the whisper of tools, he found a sanctuary from the chaos of the world.  


He was crafting this rocking chair for Mrs. Hawthorne, a kind woman who lost her husband last spring. It was meant to be a solace, a place for her to remember him, swaying gently in its embrace. Eli hoped it would bring her some peace.
