The flickering neon sign outside "Dr. Amelia Thorne's Spine & Wellness" cast long shadows across the rain-slicked asphalt of Maple Street.

She knew this case wouldnâ€™t be simple, but she was determined to help him find relief, just like she had helped countless others before him in her cozy corner practice nestled amidst the bustling energy of downtown Portland.
