The aroma of stale coffee and disinfecting wipes hung heavy in the air of Dr. Evelyn Albrightâ€™s office, a scent familiar to Amelia Rose Butterfield as the back of her throat began to thrum with the tell-tale signs of a coming migraine. 

Amelia tapped her manicured nails against the worn laminate of the reception desk, her gaze flicking between the clock ticking relentlessly on the wall and the endless stream of patients shuffling through the door. The waiting room, usually a tableau of anxious murmurs and rustling magazines, was eerily quiet today. It was one of those mornings where even the air seemed to be holding its breath, anticipating something...different. Amelia tried to ignore the prickling sensation at the back of her neck, dismissing it as caffeine withdrawal. 

Then the phone rang. A sharp, jarring sound that pierced through the tense silence. Amelia snatched the receiver, her smile plastered on as she greeted the caller in her practiced, cheerful voice. "Dr. Albright's office. This is Amelia speaking. How can I help you?"


**Setting:**  A small, cluttered medical office in a quiet suburban neighborhood. The waiting room features faded floral wallpaper, outdated magazines piled haphazardly on a coffee table, and a lone, wilting fern struggling to survive in the corner.
