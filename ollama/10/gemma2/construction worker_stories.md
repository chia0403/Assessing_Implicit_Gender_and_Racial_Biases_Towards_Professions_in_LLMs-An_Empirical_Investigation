The sun beat down on Bartholomew “Bart” O’Malley’s back like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he wrestled with another rebar cage, its cold steel biting into his calloused palms. Around him, the symphony of construction played out: the screech of metal against metal, the thrumming bass of jackhammers, and the incessant chatter of workers navigating the labyrinthine scaffolding. 

The setting was the skeletal remains of what would soon be Chicago’s newest skyscraper, a glittering jewel rising from the heart of the city. The building itself stood as a monument to ambition, its steel skeleton reaching for the heavens like a metallic tree against the cloudless blue sky. But for Bart, it was just another job, another chance to earn an honest wage and put food on the table for his wife and two young daughters. He’d been climbing these scaffolding ladders since he was a teenager, following in his father's footsteps, each day a testament to grit and endurance. 


He paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, and looked out over the sprawling cityscape below. The familiar panorama never failed to awe him – the glittering lake, the patchwork of green parks, and the endless maze of streets teeming with life. But today, a knot of unease tightened in his stomach. Something felt different, off-kilter. He couldn’t put his finger on it, but he had a nagging feeling that this day, like the skyscraper itself, was about to reach new heights – for better or worse.
