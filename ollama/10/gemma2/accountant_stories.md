The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head like a chorus of impatient wasps.  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grimy windows of her cramped office. Stacks of invoices teetered precariously on every available surface, threatening to topple over and engulf her in a paper avalanche at any moment. Outside, the bustling city of New York roared, a symphony of car horns and sirens that Amelia couldn't quite hear through the thin walls of her third-floor walk-up. 

Amelia, a woman with perpetually frazzled brown hair and eyes that held the weary wisdom of someone who had seen too many numbers, sighed. It was tax season, which meant sleepless nights, endless spreadsheets, and a diet consisting primarily of lukewarm coffee and stale crackers. Today was proving particularly challenging, as a particularly thorny case involving an eccentric artist claiming to have lost his deductible "inspiration" threatened to push her over the edge.
