Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Helena Maria Thompson stood at the edge of the worn wooden dock, gazing out across the murky waters of the Blackwood River. The late afternoon sun cast a golden glow over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, where she had spent the past decade teaching literature and folklore at Ravenswood University.

As a professor of mythopoeic studies, Helena was no stranger to the darker corners of human imagination, but there was something about this place that unsettled her. Maybe it was the way the river seemed to whisper secrets to itself in the fading light, or the feel of ancient history lurking just beneath the surface of the town's quaint streets and worn buildings.

Helena took a deep breath, feeling the cool evening air fill her lungs as she surveyed the quiet landscape. The university's old stone building loomed behind her, its Gothic spires reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. To her left, the river flowed sluggishly through a narrow channel, lined with weathered piers and rusty fishing nets.

It was a place where stories came alive, Helena knew. And tonight, as she stood on the dock, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to come alive in ways both wondrous and terrifying.
