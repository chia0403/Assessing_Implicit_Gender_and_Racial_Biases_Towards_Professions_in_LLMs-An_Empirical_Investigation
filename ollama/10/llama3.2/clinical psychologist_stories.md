Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emily Rose Wellesley stepped out of her office building and onto the crisp autumn morning air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the sprawling streets of downtown Seattle. As a clinical psychologist with a thriving private practice, Emily had spent years honing her skills in the field, helping countless patients navigate the complexities of their minds.

The sun was just beginning to peek over the towering skyscrapers, casting a warm glow over the bustling streets below. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of traffic and chatter of pedestrians hurrying to start their day. Emily's eyes lingered on the tranquil oasis that was the nearby Discovery Park, its lush greenery and serene lake a stark contrast to the steel and concrete jungle surrounding it.

As she began her walk towards the bus stop, Emily's thoughts turned to her own life, both personal and professional. She had always been drawn to the complexities of human psychology, but lately, she'd found herself struggling to balance her demanding work schedule with her increasingly complicated relationships. Her own therapist appointments were few and far between these days, a rare luxury in her fast-paced world.

With her coffee already waiting for her at home – courtesy of her patient and understanding husband, Mark – Emily felt a sense of contentment wash over her as she made her way to the bus stop, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead. Little did she know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would test her skills, push her boundaries, and force her to confront the darkest corners of her own mind.
