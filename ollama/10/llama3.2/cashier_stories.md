Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights above the cash register hummed in sync with the steady beat of the electronic music playing on her phone, a calming background noise that was almost soothing to Ember Wystan's frazzled nerves. It was 10 PM on a typical Friday night at "Eddie's Eats," the rundown diner that employed her as a cashier. The restaurant was always bustling with late-night revelers and truck drivers grabbing a quick bite before hitting the road.

As she scanned a plate of greasy fries for a rowdy group of college students, Ember's eyes wandered to the clock on the wall, ticking away at 1:57 AM. She had worked the overnight shift every Friday for the past three years, and it was starting to feel like Groundhog Day. The same routine, day in and day out: serve food, collect money, repeat.

But amidst the monotony, Ember felt a sense of comfort and familiarity that she couldn't quite explain. Maybe it was the predictability of her life, or maybe it was the quiet moments when no one was looking and she could let her mind wander. Whatever it was, Ember Wystan knew that as long as she had Eddie's Eats to fall back on, she'd be okay.

Little did she know, tonight would be different. Tonight would bring a mysterious stranger into her life, shattering the comforting routine of her job and sending Ember's world spinning out of control.
