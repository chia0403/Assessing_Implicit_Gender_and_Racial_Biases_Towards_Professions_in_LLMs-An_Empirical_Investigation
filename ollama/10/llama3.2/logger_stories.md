Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a pale light over the dense forest that loomed beyond the edge of town. The air was crisp and cool, with a hint of damp earth and decaying leaves. It was a smell that Jack Everett knew all too well, one that brought back memories of his childhood spent logging in these very woods.

Jack, a rugged and seasoned logger in his mid-40s, stood at the edge of the forest, sipping on a cup of coffee as he surveyed the day's work ahead. His worn denim jacket was slung over one shoulder, and his calloused hands gripped the worn wooden handle of his axe. He had been coming to these woods for nigh on 20 years, ever since he'd left college to take up an apprenticeship with his father, who had taught him everything he knew about felling trees.

As Jack scanned the forest floor, his eyes landed on a familiar landmark - a massive cedar tree that stood sentinel over the rest of the stand. He nodded to himself, making a mental note to tackle that one first thing. It was going to be a long day, but Jack was ready for whatever the woods threw his way.

Willow Creek was a tiny town in the heart of Oregon's Willamette National Forest, surrounded by towering pine and fir trees that stretched up towards the sky like green giants. The town itself was little more than a handful of shops and restaurants, all clustered around the main street that ran along the banks of the nearby Willow River. Jack lived on the outskirts of town, in a small cabin that his father had built for him when he was just starting out.

Little did he know, however, that today would bring more than just the usual challenges of logging...
