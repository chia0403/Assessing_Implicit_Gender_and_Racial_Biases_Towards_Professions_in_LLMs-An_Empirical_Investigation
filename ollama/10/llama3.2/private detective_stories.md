Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glowed like a dirty mirror at dawn, reflecting the neon lights of the city's bars and clubs. It was a drizzly morning in late October, the kind that made you want to stay inside with a cup of coffee and forget about the world outside. But for Emilia "Mia" Rodriguez, private detective, there was no escape from the day ahead.

Inside her office on Pike Street, a small firm nestled between a vintage bookstore and a used car lot, Mia sipped on a lukewarm cup of black coffee as she stared at the latest stack of unpaid bills. She'd been in business for five years, and it seemed like every client was a high-stakes case waiting to happen.

Just then, her phone rang, shrill and insistent. Mia picked up, squinting at the caller ID display: "Miles Reynolds, attorney-at-law." Her gut told her this one wouldn't be another "lost my cat" or "my spouse is cheating on me" case. Miles was a big-time lawyer who only hired detectives when he had no other choice.

"Mia Rodriguez speaking," she said, already sensing the desperation in his voice.

There was a pause, and for a moment Mia wondered if she'd even gotten through to him. But then Miles spoke up, his words tumbling out like a confession:

"Emilia, I need your help. My client...my former partner...she's gone missing. The police won't touch it, but I think something terrible has happened."

Mia felt the familiar itch in her brain, a spark of curiosity that never failed to get her blood pumping. This was going to be a long day.
