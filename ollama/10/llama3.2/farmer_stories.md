Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the rolling hills of Willow Creek Farm, casting a warm orange glow over the fields and farmhouse. Elijah Thaddeus Fletcher, a ruggedly weathered farmer in his late 30s with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, stood at the edge of the property, surveying the day's harvest. The scent of freshly turned earth and ripe crops wafted up from the fields, mingling with the sweet aroma of blooming wildflowers.

As he gazed out at the land, Elijah felt a sense of pride and ownership wash over him. This was his family's farm, passed down through generations of Fletchers. His great-grandfather had first settled on this land in the late 1800s, and Elijah had spent his entire life learning the ins and outs of farming from his father and grandfather before him.

The farmhouse, a sturdy old homestead with white clapboard siding and a tin roof, stood at the center of the property. Smoke drifted lazily from the chimney, carrying the promise of warm supper and conversation with his wife, Emma. It was going to be a long and eventful night in Willow Creek, Elijah knew.

But as he turned to head back towards the house, Elijah noticed something peculiar - a figure lingering at the edge of the property, just beyond the reach of the fading sunlight. Who were they, and what did they want on his land?
