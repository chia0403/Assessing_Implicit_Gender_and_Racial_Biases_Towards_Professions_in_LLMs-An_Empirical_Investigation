Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

It was the first day of April, and the sun was shining brightly over the small town of Oakdale, Illinois. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming cherry blossoms, which lined the streets of Main Street, where tax season was in full swing.

In his small office above the local deli, Bertrand "Bert" Thompson, a seasoned income tax preparer, sat at his desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. Bert had been preparing taxes for over 20 years, and he took pride in his work, knowing that he was helping his clients navigate the complex world of tax laws and regulations.

As he began to review the stack of files in front of him, Bert's mind wandered back to his own struggles with money. Growing up in a working-class family, Bert had always been taught the importance of living within one's means and saving for the future. But after completing college, he found himself struggling to make ends meet, forced to work multiple part-time jobs just to cover his student loan payments.

Despite the challenges, Bert persevered, using his natural aptitude for numbers and business to eventually land a job as an income tax preparer at a local accounting firm. Over time, he built up a loyal client base of hardworking individuals and small business owners, who trusted him to handle their financial affairs with care.

As Bert delved into the stack of files in front of him, his thoughts turned to the upcoming tax deadline, which was fast approaching. He knew that this year's tax season would be particularly busy, what with the new tax reforms and the recent changes to the tax code. But Bert was undaunted, confident in his ability to guide his clients through even the most complex financial situations.

Little did Bert know, however, that this tax season would bring more than just a typical array of returns and deductions. It would also bring a mystery, a problem that would test Bert's skills and ingenuity like never before...
