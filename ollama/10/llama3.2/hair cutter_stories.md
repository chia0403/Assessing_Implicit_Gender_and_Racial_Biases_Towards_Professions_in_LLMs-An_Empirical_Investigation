Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and shops that lined Main Street. Inside "Snips & Styles" salon, Aurora Waverly Jenkins was closing up shop for the day, her scissors and clippers neatly stored in their designated containers as she counted down the till.

Aurora, or Rory to those who knew her well, had spent the entire day snipping and styling the hair of Willow Creek's residents, from the bouffant-sporting retiree at the local diner to the punk-rock enthusiasts at the town's music venue. As a skilled hair cutter with a passion for artistry, she took pride in making every client feel seen and heard.

As she locked up her salon and slipped on her jacket, Rory couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction wash over her. It had been a good day â€“ the phone had been ringing nonstop with appointments, and the tips had been generous. She made a mental note to treat herself to dinner at the new bistro that had opened up down the street.

But as she stepped out into the cool evening air, Rory noticed something strange. A piece of paper was tucked under the door of her car, which was parked outside the salon with its engine still running. She walked over to investigate, feeling a shiver run down her spine as she picked up the note. It read: "Meet me at the old oak tree in the park at midnight. Come alone."
