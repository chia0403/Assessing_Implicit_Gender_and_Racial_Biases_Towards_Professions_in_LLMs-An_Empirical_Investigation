Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the desert landscape as Ryder Jackson made his way back to the small RV that served as his home away from home. As a highway worker with the Arizona Department of Transportation, Ryder spent most of his days and nights patrolling the state's vast network of highways, fixing potholes and repairing guardrails.

He had been working on Highway 60 for weeks, tasked with repaving the stretch between Phoenix and Tucson. It was grueling work, but it paid well and allowed Ryder to see some of the most beautiful parts of Arizona. As he drove his truck down the highway, the dry air sucked the moisture from his skin and the endless expanse of desert stretched out before him like a golden sea.

Ryder pulled into the small parking lot near milepost 200, where he lived in the RV that was painted with a faded logo of a hammer and anvil. He climbed out of the truck and took a deep breath of the cool evening air, feeling the sweat-drenched shirt cling to his back. It was going to be another long night ahead.

Just as Ryder was starting to think about heading into town for some dinner and maybe a beer, he noticed something strange on the side of the road. A dark shape, partially obscured by the desert scrub, seemed out of place in this desolate landscape. Ryder's instincts told him that something was off, but he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.

He got back into his truck and started to drive towards the shape, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of movement. As he drew closer, he realized with a start that it was a small sedan, partially hidden by some bushes. The windows were rolled up, and there was no sign of life anywhere in sight.

Ryder's heart began to beat faster as he pulled over to investigate. What was this car doing all alone out here? And why did it seem so... ominous?
