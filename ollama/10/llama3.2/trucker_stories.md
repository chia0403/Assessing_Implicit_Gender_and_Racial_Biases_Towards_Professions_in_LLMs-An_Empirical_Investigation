Here's a story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Red Rock, Arizona, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty main street. The only sound was the distant hum of a diesel engine, a reminder that the night shift was just beginning for trucker Jack Edward "Hawk" Hawkins.

Jack, a rugged and weathered man in his mid-40s with a thick beard and piercing blue eyes, had been driving trucks for over two decades. He'd seen it all - from the bright lights of Los Angeles to the sun-scorched highways of Texas, and everywhere in between. But Red Rock was his home base, the place where he could lay low and avoid the prying eyes of the authorities.

As Jack settled into his worn leather seat at the wheel of his Peterbilt 359, he took a long pull from his cigarette, feeling the familiar burn in his lungs. He'd just finished unloading a shipment of auto parts to a dealership in Phoenix and was now headed back east on I-40, bound for Chicago. The miles stretched out before him like an endless highway, promising nothing but solitude and the open road.

Little did Jack know, however, that this trip would be different from all the others. A mysterious package had been slipped onto his trailer, one that would change everything he thought he knew about himself and his life on the road. And as he pulled out of Red Rock's shadow, the darkness gathering ahead like a storm cloud, Hawk Hawkins was about to find himself at the center of a world he never could have imagined.
