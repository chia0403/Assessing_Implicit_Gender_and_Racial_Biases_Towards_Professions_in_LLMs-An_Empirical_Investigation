Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the bay, shrouding the small town of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a damp shroud. Inside the cramped, cluttered office of "ElectriFy", the local electrical contracting business founded by his father decades ago, Jack Edward Thompson hunched over a worn, leather-bound manual, attempting to decipher the arcane language of 19th-century wiring codes.

As an electrician with a passion for restoration and preservation, Jack had grown up surrounded by the flickering glow of old lamps, the soft hum of motors, and the sweet scent of burning wire. His father's business had been a staple of Ravenswood's Main Street for years, but with the town's steady decline in recent decades, Jack's own future as an electrician was uncertain.

With a sigh, Jack set aside the manual and rubbed his tired eyes, the faint glow of the computer screen illuminating the darkening room. The phone on his desk jolted him back to reality with a shrill ring, snapping him out of his reverie like a sudden jolt of electricity. Who was it this time?
