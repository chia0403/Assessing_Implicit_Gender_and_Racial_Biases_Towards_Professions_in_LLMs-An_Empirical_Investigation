Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit dressing room was a sanctuary for Aurora Waverley Wilder, a rising star in the music industry. The soft hum of the fluorescent lights above cast an ethereal glow on the worn velvet curtains that lined the walls, while the scent of old perfume and stale air clung to every surface like a bad habit. A faded poster of her idol, Lola LaRue, adorned one wall, its colors muted by years of neglect.

Aurora's fingers drummed impatiently against the armrests of the velvet chaise lounge as she checked her phone for what felt like the hundredth time that evening. The venue was packed, and her team had assured her that the crowd would be on its feet when she took the stage. But at 25 years old, Aurora couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

She was about to take a deep breath and calm her racing heart when her manager, Rachel, burst into the room with a look of urgency on her face. "Aurora, we need to talk," she said, her voice low and serious. "Something's happened, and I don't know how much longer this show is going to last."

And with that, everything changed.
