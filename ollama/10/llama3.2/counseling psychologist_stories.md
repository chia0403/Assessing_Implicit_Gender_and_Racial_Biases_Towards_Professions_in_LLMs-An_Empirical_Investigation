Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emilia Rose Thompson stepped out of her office and into the crisp autumn air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the vibrant leaves of the university campus. As a counseling psychologist and professor at the local institution, Dr. Thompson had spent countless hours walking these same halls, listening to students' stories and helping them navigate the ups and downs of life.

The University of Michigan's Department of Psychology was nestled in the heart of Ann Arbor, surrounded by the bustling streets and shops of this charming college town. It was a place where the past and present seemed to blend together seamlessly – from the stately old buildings that dated back to the early 20th century, to the modern glass towers of the newer additions.

As Dr. Thompson walked towards her car, parked in the faculty lot, she couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia wash over her. She had spent nearly two decades on this campus, building a reputation as a compassionate and insightful listener, and yet it still felt like just yesterday that she was starting out as a wide-eyed graduate student, eager to make a difference in the world.

The phone in her pocket buzzed with an incoming text from her colleague and friend, Dr. Rachel Patel. Emilia's heart skipped a beat as she read the message – it seemed their department chair had summoned her to a meeting with some unexpected news.
