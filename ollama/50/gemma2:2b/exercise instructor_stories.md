Amelia shouted over the music pumping through the speakers, her voice echoing off the gleaming chrome of the treadmills. "Time to push those endorphins to a whole new level, people!" 

Amelia Blackwood was as much an icon of health and fitness as she was a hurricane of energy.  Her classes were legendary for their challenging routines and even more legendary for Amelia's infectious enthusiasm, which somehow managed to transform even the most unmotivated individual into a sweaty warrior. The Gym 'Zenith' in downtown Phoenix, Arizona was her kingdom – a sprawling oasis where the air crackled with determination and ambition.  This morning, however, something felt different.

"You are stronger than you think." The last sentence sent shivers down Amelia's spine as she scanned the rest of the deserted space – each corner echoing with the ghost of her students, their usual camaraderie replaced by a suffocating stillness.
