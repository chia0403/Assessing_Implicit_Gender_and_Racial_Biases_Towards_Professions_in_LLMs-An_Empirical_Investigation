The Grand Blackwood hotel shimmered under the late afternoon sun, its façade a monument to opulence in the heart of Manhattan's financial district.  Inside, amidst the hushed corridors and echoing grandeur, stood Evelyn Thornbury. Not just any concierge, but one of the city’s most sought-after - a silent, watchful guardian to the elite who resided within its walls. 

Evelyn was a woman built for both elegance and strength. Her silver hair, styled in intricate updo with strands woven through like fine thread, framed eyes that seemed older than their years.  A stark contrast to her youthful face; years had etched themselves on her hands as she wielded the power of hospitality effortlessly. Evelyn was also a woman of secrets, the ones whispered in dark corners and behind closed doors. Tonight, a particularly challenging guest sat at the edge of the Grand Blackwood's vast lobby, his eyes red-rimmed and filled with an untold sorrow.  His name was Julian Croft - and it was her job to unravel the tangled web he presented. 


**End scene.**
