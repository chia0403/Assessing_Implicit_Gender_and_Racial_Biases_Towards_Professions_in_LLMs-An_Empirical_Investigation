## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the dusty windows of "The Blueprint", a small drafting office tucked away on a cobblestone street in Prague. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee, worn paper, and the low hum of an old IBM typewriter. 

Bartholomew "Bart" Kowalski sat hunched over his desk, a tangle of blueprints precariously balanced across the chipped surface. His brow furrowed as he traced the intricate lines of a new building design.  For years, Bart had toiled away in this cramped office, creating detailed plans for everything from humble apartment buildings to sprawling factories. He was known for his meticulousness - detail-oriented, precise, and utterly dedicated to crafting perfect blueprints that could translate into reality.

But today, something felt different. A knot of anxiety tightened in his chest as he stared at the project in front of him: a monumental cathedral slated to be built on the precipice of Prague's vibrant old town.  The scale was staggering, the ambition almost absurd.
