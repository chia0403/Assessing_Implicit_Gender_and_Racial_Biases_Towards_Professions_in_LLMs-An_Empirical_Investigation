The air hung heavy with the scent of crayons, spilled juice boxes, and yesterday's gingerbread cookies. The sun, already dipping towards the horizon like a melting orange, cast long shadows across Ms. Amelia Nightingale's third-grade classroom in Mrs. Willowbrook Elementary School. 

Amelia watched the tiny figures scurry around her like confetti on a windy day: Daniel with his oversized dinosaur backpack, Leo clutching a homemade paper dragon, and Lily who had been diligently collecting stray glitter for what felt like hours.  Her heart was a warm knot of love – as always – when she saw them so engaged in their imaginative play, their laughter bubbling like the overflowing water table at her feet. It was this chaotic beauty that she cherished most about teaching in the early years. It was a symphony of innocence and wonder, an explosion of colours and sounds. 

But there was something else brewing beneath the surface of her usual contentedness today – a prickle of unease, like the start of a story not yet written.  A strange silence had descended upon them after Ms. Davis, the school secretary with her perpetual frown and ever-growing stack of paperwork, announced a "situation" that had everyone on edge.
