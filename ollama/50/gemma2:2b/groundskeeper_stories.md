The morning mist clung to the sprawling rose garden like a child's forgotten dreams. Amelia Willowbrook, known to everyone simply as Millie, knelt amongst the tangled stems, her worn hands carefully plucking a wayward thorn.  For decades, she had tended this haven for flora and fauna alike, its vibrant beauty the solace of Lord Aldridge, the aging, reclusive heir to a sprawling estate. The sprawling grounds held secrets – whispers in the rustling leaves, hushed conversations across the stone walls – all lost to Millie's keen eye. 

The garden was her universe, each blooming rose a silent testament to life's relentless cycle. This morning, however, a disquiet hung in the air thicker than the fog clinging to the ancient oak that marked the garden's heart. The normally boisterous birdsong had been replaced by an unsettling silence; even the usual scurrying of squirrels seemed hesitant.  The air was charged with something unseen but keenly felt – a growing tension that tickled at Millie’s frayed nerves.
