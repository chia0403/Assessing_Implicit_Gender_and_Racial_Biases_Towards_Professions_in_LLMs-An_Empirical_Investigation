##  The Clock Ticked, but So Did Eleanor

**Setting:** A swanky law firm in downtown Chicago, Illinois, 1920s. The air was thick with cigar smoke, echoing laughter over dinner parties, and the nervous clinking of typewriters on the top floor where Eleanor worked.

Eleanor Montgomery, with her perfectly pressed suit and meticulously coiffed hair, was the embodiment of grace within the chaos. Her days were a symphony of hushed whispers, carefully typed memos, and endless phone calls, all orchestrated by the demanding, yet undeniably handsome, Mr. Prescott. He was a rising star in Chicago's legal world, whose reputation for success was only surpassed by his volatile temper and even more volatile charm. 

Her routine began with a flurry of emails from the court staff, then to a sea of documents that she meticulously organized on her mahogany desk.  Eleanor felt as though each passing day had its own rhythm, like a waltz played out in the humdrum office life. Yet, beneath the surface of perfectly aligned files and polished surfaces, Eleanor's heart beat with an underlying restlessness. 

**Opening:** The clock chimed three times - once for the third hour, another for the fourth. And as it neared five oâ€™clock, a wave of unease washed over Eleanor. Mr. Prescott was late, and his usual fanfare had been missing, leaving her feeling like a forgotten secretary in a whirlwind office.
