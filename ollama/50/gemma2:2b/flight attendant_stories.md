## The Setting:

**Location:**  A bustling international airport terminal in Amsterdam. 

**Time:** Early morning on a Tuesday. 

The air was thick with exhaust fumes and anticipation. Jet engines roared in the distance as planes taxied for their departure gates, while tourists rushed past, clutching maps and overflowing backpacks. The scent of coffee, freshly baked pastries, and something vaguely floral – lavender perhaps – wafted from vendors selling souvenirs and snacks.  A steady stream of passengers shuffled through security checkpoints, their faces a mixture of excitement and worry, as the start of another week dawned.

## Character: 

**Name:** Elara Jansen 
**(Age: 27)**

Elara wore her silver-threaded uniform with practiced ease. The familiar crispness of the collar was comforting as she navigated through the throngs of travelers. Her face, framed by thick chestnut hair usually pulled back in a neat bun, held an expression of controlled calm and quiet determination. Elara had been working as a flight attendant for five years now, but even after all these years, the airport felt like a stage – each passenger her audience.

## Opening:

Elara was stationed at gate 37, just past the baggage carousel, where passengers would disembark their journeys from distant lands and stumble onto the tarmac. A gentle hum of anxiety hung in the air as families gathered to greet them, while others looked down at their phones, faces reflecting a mix of exhaustion and hope.  

Elara watched it all with a practiced detachment. Her smile was warm, her eyes crinkled at the corners as she met every passenger's gaze with genuine warmth. But beneath the surface, Elara felt a prickle of unease. The air vibrated with an undercurrent of something that wasn't quite understood – a strange tension in the room, like the silence before the storm.   Elara adjusted her satchel and glanced at the digital flight board. 

"Flight 420 to Dublin is just about boarding," she announced to the growing crowd, her voice clear and authoritative as always.  But even her own words echoed with a strange hollowness; Elara knew something was amiss. And she wasn't sure if it would make the journey any better.
