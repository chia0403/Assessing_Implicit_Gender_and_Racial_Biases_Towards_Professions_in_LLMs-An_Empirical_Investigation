The early morning mist clung to the emerald blades of grass like hesitant whispers, and the air tasted of dew and freshly turned earth.  Ethan Blackwood, his calloused hands already stained with the earthy hues of the dawn, knelt in the center of his carefully curated garden. He was a craftsman, not merely a landscaper, each blade of grass meticulously placed, each flower a testament to months of planning and dedicated toil. 

His eyes, though weathered by years under the sun, still carried the sparkle of youthful ambition; a twinkle that only years of solitude could have nurtured.

Ethan’s haven was his legacy – the sprawling estate left to him by his grandmother, a woman known for her love for nature and her quiet strength. It was a sanctuary from the bustling city life he'd sworn off years ago, a place where time moved at its own measured pace, dictated only by the sun's rise and fall.  But now, as the unsettling silence of the estate seemed to amplify his every thought, Ethan felt an unfamiliar feeling stirring within him - a knot of apprehension that tightened with each passing moment.
