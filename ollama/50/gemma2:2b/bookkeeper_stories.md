Rain lashed against the single pane of glass in Elara Thornley's office window, blurring the already dim street lights of Willow Creek into hazy smudges. She hunched deeper into her chair, swirling the lukewarm tea in her chipped mug. The air hung thick and heavy with the damp smell of old paper and stale coffee, a scent she had come to associate more with the grim reality of her life than anything else.

Elara Thornley was no glamorous woman.  Her days were spent navigating a labyrinth of ledger entries, reconciling bank statements, and chasing after delinquent accounts – a soul-crushing task that occupied every waking moment since her graduation from the prestigious but unforgiving University of Accounts in New York. Her name, once whispered with reverence amongst budding accountants, now felt like a heavy weight on her chest, a constant reminder of her unfulfilled dreams.

The only solace Elara had found was in the dusty stacks of books she kept hidden behind her desk – remnants from her younger self who had dreamt of becoming a writer. Now, those dreams lay dormant, buried beneath the suffocating routine and predictable humdrum of being a bookkeeper in a sleepy town like Willow Creek.  But tonight, as she stared at the storm raging outside, Elara felt a familiar itch, an unsettling sense that there was something more, something waiting to be unlocked. 


**Setting:** A small, cluttered office above a bakery in Willow Creek, Wyoming.
