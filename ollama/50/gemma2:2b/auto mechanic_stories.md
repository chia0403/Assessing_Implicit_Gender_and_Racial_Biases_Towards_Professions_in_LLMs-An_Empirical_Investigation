Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of Leo's garage like tiny fists pounding on a drum.  Inside, amidst the aroma of oil and burnt rubber, the rhythmic whirring of his tools was a symphony to his ears. This wasn't just any garage; it was a portal to another world for him, a world built of gears and pistons, where engines sang their own melancholic tunes. He ran a grease-stained thumb across a dusty engine manifold, thinking about how the old girl would growl back to life once he coaxed her out of this stubborn standstill. His name was Leo "The Fixer" Rossi, after all, and there were few things he couldn't fix, though some problems were harder than others. 

Today, however, even his usual magic felt weak against the overwhelming pressure. A storm had rolled in with unexpected ferocity, cutting off power and trapping him in his workshop, a concrete cage of metal and machinery. Outside, thunder grumbled like a wounded animal, and the wind howled like a banshee through the gaps in the weathered wooden frame of his building. 

A low rumble echoed in the distance, growing steadily louder as he looked out a window.  It wasn't the familiar hum of the city; this was something different, primal, guttural. His heart started to race. The sound, like a monstrous lullaby, seemed to be calling him, beckoning him to join its rhythm, to dive into the unknown, and face whatever lurked in the shadows behind that relentless storm.
