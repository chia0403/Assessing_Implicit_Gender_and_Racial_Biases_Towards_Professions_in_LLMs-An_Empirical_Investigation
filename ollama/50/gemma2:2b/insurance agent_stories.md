Rain splattered against the grimy office windows, blurring the bustling cityscape into a watercolour mess of grey and yellow. Inside, Elias Thorne stared out at the torrent, his reflection warping in the wet glass. He hadn't slept properly since he received the call. The voice on the line, choked with emotion and despair, still echoed in his mind. "My wife... she slipped on ice last night..." Her voice cracked like a whip, the words falling like stones in a silent river. 

Elias Thorne, Insurance Adjuster extraordinaire, felt a familiar ache in his chest. This wasn't the first time he was wading through the wreckage of someone else's misfortune.  He’d spent years navigating the treacherous waters of claims and payouts, becoming a master at sorting loss from gain. But this...this felt different. It was personal, raw, and exposed something deep within him that had long been buried under the weight of spreadsheets and policy forms. 

Today, as he sorted through his overflowing inbox, Elias felt a familiar tug on his worn-down leather chair. "Mr. Thorne?" His colleague's tired eyes peered at him through a layer of stress wrinkles. "There’s another call, seems your client wants to speak."
