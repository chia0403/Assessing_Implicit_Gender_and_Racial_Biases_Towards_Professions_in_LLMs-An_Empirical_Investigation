## Story Opening & Setting

**Name:** Amelia Evermore 

**Setting:** The quaint seaside town of Saltwater Cove rests against the vast, wild expanse of the North Sea.  The air is thick with salt and a faint tang of seaweed, constantly churned by the unpredictable winds.  Saltwater Cove, while picturesque and charming, had long known hardship and deprivation.  Years ago, it had been swallowed whole by the sea, only to be rebuilt by the tireless hands of survivors and descendants. 

**Opening:** The rhythmic thudding of Amelia Evermore's wooden kneading paddle against a bowl of flour was the symphony of her morning.  Each swirl of dough yielded a familiar sense of comfort – a quiet rhythm amidst the constant clamor of the salty winds whipping across Saltwater Cove. She was known to many as 'The Sugar Mermaid,' thanks to her bakery, "Mermaid's Delight," located on the harbor side overlooking the churning waves. Its windows were often fogged with salt spray, and the air hung heavy with the aroma of cinnamon and baking bread.

The morning was bright but already turning overcast, a change in wind heralding an approaching storm. Amelia felt it in her bones – this wasn't just a fleeting chill; it was the kind of premonition that clung to Saltwater Cove like seaweed on driftwood.  She glanced at the newspaper spread out on the counter: "Coastal Erosion Threatens Old Town" - a headline that had begun to echo in the silence of her kitchen, a silence she knew too well.
