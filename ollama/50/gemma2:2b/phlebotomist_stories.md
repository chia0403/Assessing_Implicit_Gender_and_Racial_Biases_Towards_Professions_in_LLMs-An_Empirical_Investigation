##  Story Opening:

The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the familiar metallic tang of blood that always seemed to cling to everything in Evelyn Hayes' life like a second skin. She stepped carefully through the sterile doors of the clinic, her worn leather shoes barely making a sound on the tile floor. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an almost sickly yellow glow upon the rows of examination chairs and cluttered workbenches where she usually spent hours painstakingly drawing blood from weary patients. 

Evelyn was known for her steady hand, her quiet demeanor, and her uncanny ability to make even the most apprehensive patient feel at ease. Today, however, something felt different. A knot of unease sat heavy in her stomach, a feeling amplified by the unusually large crowd gathered in the waiting room - a mixture of nervous faces and worried mothers holding their children close. 

It was an unusual morning, a day where the usual hum of the clinic seemed to be replaced by a palpable sense of dread. The reason? A new, mysterious ailment was sweeping through the town. And Evelyn, as always, stood ready with her needle and syringe, poised to face whatever came next.
