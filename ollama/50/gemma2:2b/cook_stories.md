Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of The Copper Kettle Cafe, blurring the already muted colors of the Parisian street outside. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of roasting coffee beans, simmering onions, and a hint of something distinctly *un-Parisian* - cinnamon and cardamom. 

Esmeralda "Em" Dubois, her apron dusted with flour and sweat from hours spent kneading dough, surveyed the chaos of her kitchen with weary eyes.  A symphony of clanging pots and pans battled against the insistent rhythm of rain as she expertly navigated the slippery floor, each move a practiced ballet of efficiency. The cafe's rustic charm, however charming in theory, was currently an arena for culinary carnage. 

Em wasn’t a Parisian at heart. Her family had emigrated from the sun-drenched islands of Mauritius, and her life revolved around the comforting rhythm of spices and citrus – a far cry from the refined artistry of French haute cuisine that permeated The Copper Kettle's menu. But tonight was different. Tonight was the night she would finally cook for the notorious Parisian critic, Monsieur Gustave Dubois -  a man with an unfaltering palate and even more discerning eyes. 


**End scene.**
