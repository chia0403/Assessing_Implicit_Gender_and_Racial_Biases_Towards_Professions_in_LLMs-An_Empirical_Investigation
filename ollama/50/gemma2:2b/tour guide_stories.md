##  The Ghostly Promenade

**Opening:** A chill wind whipped through the cobblestone alleys of Paris, whistling past the eaves of half-timbered houses that huddled like tired children against the looming shadows of the city's ancient towers. Rain splattered on the wide awning above Eleanor Thorne's head as she adjusted her scarf, pulling it tighter to ward off the biting Parisian air.  

Eleanor was a tour guide with a heart full of stories and a penchant for the macabre. This wasn’t just any tour; tonight, she would be leading a group through the most haunted corners of Paris – an undertaking that thrilled and terrified her in equal measure. 

She stepped onto the Promenade des Anglais, its elegant wrought iron balustrades shimmering under the pale glow of streetlamps. The air hummed with a strange energy that prickled at Eleanor's skin, the silence punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of rain on cobblestones and the distant rumble of Paris’ ever-present traffic.  

Tonight was a night for whispers and secrets; tonight, she would guide her group through the spectral shadows of this legendary Parisian pathway.
