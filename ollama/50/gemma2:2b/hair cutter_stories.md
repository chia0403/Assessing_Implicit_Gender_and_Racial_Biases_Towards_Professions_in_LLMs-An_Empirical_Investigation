## The Scissors and the Shadow

The air hung thick and still in the salon, thick with the sweet aroma of lavender and hairspray.  It was a scent that usually soothed Iris's nerves - even if it did occasionally leave her feeling like she was wading through a sea of floral perfume. Tonight, however, the usual soothing effect was replaced by an unsettling tension. The salon door had creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadow and swirling snow.  

Iris held her breath, waiting for the storm to pass. It wouldn't be long; she had been expecting this man. Mr. Hawthorne was his name - or so he called himself.  He hadn't entered with a face of desperation, nor with the fury of a vengeful spirit. He simply stood there, tall and gaunt in a black coat that mirrored the storm swirling outside, like an embodiment of the winter wind itself. 

His hand hovered over his briefcase, its leather worn smooth with age. The only sound was the frantic ticking of a clock in the corner as it echoed the pounding of Iris's heart. Tonight, she was about to learn more than just how to trim hair â€“ tonight, she would learn what made a man choose to cut off his own life.
