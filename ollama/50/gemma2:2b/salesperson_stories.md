Rain splattered against the grimy windowpane, mirroring the storm raging inside Amelia "Amy" Davenport's chest.  She stood in the middle of Zenith Appliances, her usual cheery demeanor replaced by a sullen mask. This wasn't her first time being stuck here during one of their notoriously slow days; after all, the sales were often as lukewarm as the coffee she had to force down at break. The store itself was a relic from another era, its chrome and glass facade struggling against years of neglect. 

Outside, the city seemed to be holding its breath. This wasn't just typical weather; it was a storm that had been brewing for weeks - an economic downturn, whispers of layoffs, and a growing sense of dread hanging in the air. But Amy knew these weren't just mere inconveniences for her customers, they were their reality too. They needed to be reminded that there was still hope. 

Amy took a deep breath, trying to remember her grandmother’s words: “There will always be sunshine after the rain, Amy.”  She straightened her tie and glanced at her watch – the hour of Amelia's first customer was approaching. Perhaps today would be different. Maybe she could turn this storm, this gloomy day, into a chance to bring some brightness back into their lives. 


**Setting:**  A quaint but rundown appliance store in a city undergoing economic turmoil.
