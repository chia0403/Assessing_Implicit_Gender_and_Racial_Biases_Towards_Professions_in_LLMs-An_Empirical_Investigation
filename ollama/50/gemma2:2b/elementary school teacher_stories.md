Rain hammered against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Winthrop's third-grade classroom. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale crayons and forgotten recess snacks. A single flickering fluorescent bulb cast long shadows across the rows of desks, highlighting the worn textbooks and the faded posters depicting smiling children on a sunny day. 

Eleanor, usually radiating warmth despite her slightly rumpled cardigan and ever-present glasses perched precariously on her nose, looked out at the swirling chaos outside. It was Tuesday, the start of what she hoped would be a good week. Tuesdays were always filled with the promise of a new theme in ELA – this week's focus: "Animal Tales." But as she surveyed the room, she couldn't help but feel a pang of unease. 

The students’ usual playful energy seemed to have been replaced by an anxious silence. A few children huddled together, their faces etched with what Eleanor suspected might be genuine fear. Even little Timmy, usually the epitome of cheerful mischief, sat hunched in the corner, clutching his lunchbox like a lifeline.

Eleanor's heart thumped against her ribs. This wouldn't do at all. Not on Tuesday.
