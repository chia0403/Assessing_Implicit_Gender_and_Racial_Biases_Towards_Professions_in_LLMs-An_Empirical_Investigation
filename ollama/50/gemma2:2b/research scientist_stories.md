The sterile white walls of Dr. Amelia Croft's lab echoed with the hum of her hyper-sensitive scanners, their constant drone a stark contrast to the silence that had draped the world for months. Outside, in the dying city of Aurora, scavengers jostled for scraps amidst boarded-up shops and crumbling skyscrapers, survivors clinging to fragile threads of hope after the Great Collapse. Amelia, her face illuminated by the soft glow of monitors, was no longer focused on research papers or university grants; she was chasing a ghost – literally.  

The last whisper of it had been an anomaly: a faint electromagnetic signal emanating from beneath the city's heart, where the once-bustling central station now stood like a skeletal monument to technological hubris. An old photograph clutched in her hand - a picture of Amelia's grandfather, a renowned physicist who vanished alongside his research team in the aftermath of the Collapse.  For years, she had obsessed over his disappearance and the cryptic notes he'd left behind, each one revealing more about what lay beneath the ruined city – an enigma that haunted Amelia even now. 

She adjusted her worn goggles, squinting at the holographic map flickering above her desk. A shiver ran down her spine as a cluster of red dots materialized: pulsating in rhythm with the faint signal, leading to the heart of the abandoned station. With renewed purpose, Amelia reached for the control panel and activated the scanner’s targeting system – the first step towards unlocking the secrets that lay buried beneath the ruins of Aurora.
