The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's weathered face as he surveyed his herd from the dusty porch of his ranch house. The wind whipped strands of greying hair across his forehead, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and the faint tang of impending dust storm.  Silas had been running the sprawling "Blackwood" property for nearly half a century, ever since his grandfather's passing, but today felt different. A sense of foreboding hung in the air like a hawk circling low. 

The setting sun painted the sky with hues of orange and purple, mirroring the turmoil swirling within Silas' heart.  He was nearing sixty years of age, the lines etched on his face a testament to countless days spent under the unforgiving Wyoming sun, battling drought, scorching heatwaves, and an unforgiving silence from his only son, Caleb.

Caleb had vanished nearly three weeks ago, leaving only a cryptic note scribbled in charcoal on a weathered piece of wood: “The winds will shift," it read.  His brother's sudden departure left the ranch reeling, their once harmonious harmony replaced by a palpable tension. The silence was suffocating, broken only by the rhythmic creak of the old windmill and Silas' heavy sigh.
