The fluorescent lights hummed like restless insects in Evelyn "Evie" Thorne's cluttered office.  Boxes overflowed with last year's returns, receipts strewn across the desk like discarded confetti after a particularly exuberant New Year's Eve party. The scent of stale coffee and tax forms clung to the air, a potent mixture that felt almost familiar despite its perpetual unpleasantness. It was December in the sleepy town of Oakhaven, Illinois, and while snow had finally begun to fall outside, Evie’s world seemed trapped beneath a layer of red tape and unfulfilled promises. 

Evie wasn't just preparing taxes; she was orchestrating dreams - small, flickering hopes that materialized as returns soared into their rightful owners' accounts. But this year, even the whispers of possibility felt hollow. A shadow hung over her work like a lingering fog—her father’s recent illness, the mounting pressure of rising insurance costs, and an ever-present fear of what she could never truly afford to fix - all were adding a distinct weight to the stacks of forms before her.
