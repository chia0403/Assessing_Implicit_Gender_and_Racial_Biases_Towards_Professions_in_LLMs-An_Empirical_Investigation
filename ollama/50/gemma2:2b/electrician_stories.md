Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Mr. Thornton's workshop, the relentless drumming a low-frequency symphony that vibrated through his worn-out boots as he worked. It was an evening most electricians would consider off-hours, but not for young Jasper Thornton. He called himself "Jasper" to anyone outside of his workshop, and even then only if they insisted. After all, he'd spent years crafting a life in the shadow of his family name – Thornton, synonymous with the legendary electrics company that had built its empire on the foundations of their ancestors. But for Jasper, it was merely a surname, another cog in the machine he wanted to dismantle.

Tonight, however, he wasn’t working on any of the high-voltage projects that would earn him the usual praise and recognition from his peers – the one that drew the crowds at Thornton's Electric. He was here, hunched over a pile of scavenged scrap metal, tinkering with a dusty box salvaged from an abandoned warehouse. Inside, tangled wires whispered secrets only he could decipher, and he was determined to hear their whispers for himself. 
The setting: a dilapidated workshop in the heart of Detroit's forgotten district. A haven for misfits and outcasts, it stood as a monument to the city’s faded glory, mirroring the conflicted spirit of its owner – the electrifying potential hidden within the mundane.
