The neon lights of Sunset Harbor reflected off Dr. Alistair Sterling's tired eyes as he stood on the loading dock. The rhythmic clang of the crane unloading a fresh shipment of oxygen tanks filled the air, but his mind was elsewhere.  He was already miles away in his head, reliving the incident that had haunted him since it happened last Tuesday - the woman with the broken neck, the frantic pleas for help echoing into the night as he wrestled with the mangled metal wreckage of her car before being forced to stand back and watch helplessly as paramedics were unable to stabilize her.  

Sunset Harbor, a bustling coastal town known for its idyllic beaches and charming Victorian architecture, had always been Alistair's sanctuary. But lately, it felt more like a prison of memories, of unanswered questions and the crushing weight of his responsibility. He clutched the worn leather-bound journal in his pocket, hoping to find solace within the well-worn pages, but even as he flipped through its yellowed pages, the images of that night flooded back, the details burned onto his mind like a branding iron. He was an emergency medical care provider, a beacon of hope for those caught in the chaos of life's sudden turns. Yet, sometimes, it felt like that very beacon couldn't reach all corners of the darkness. 

A gust of wind sent a stray wave crashing against the dock, momentarily drowning out the rhythmic clang of the crane. A lone seagull screeched overhead before disappearing into the swirling mist. Alistair took a deep breath, hoping to find some peace amongst the chaos. It was time. He had patients to save and a town to navigate through its storms, one emergency at a time.
