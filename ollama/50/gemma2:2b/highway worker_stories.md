The air hung heavy with humidity, thick enough to taste on Daniel's lips as he wiped sweat from his brow. Sun beat down mercilessly on the cracked asphalt ribbon of Highway 79, baking the orange and yellow paint that marked its progress through the vast California desert. Dust devils danced in the distance, their ephemeral forms stirring up a miniature sandstorm around Daniel's worn work boots.  He squinted at the towering overhead cable, its exposed steel strands groaning under the weight of a hundred miles worth of ambition. The hum of its constant electric pulse was his only company save for the occasional chirp of a mockingbird perched atop one of the metal pylons that dotted the highway like skeletal sentinels. This was Daniel's life now: toiling in this unforgiving landscape, mending the very fabric of America's arteries, mile after desolate mile.

Daniel wiped his forehead again, then glanced up at the sky. A lone hawk circled lazily overhead, its silhouette stark against the endless blue canvas.  He felt a familiar ache settle in his chest â€“ a longing for something beyond the endless road, beyond these barren stretches of highway and dusty horizon. He adjusted his work cap, the faded orange fabric a testament to years of service beneath this unforgiving sun. The weight of responsibility was a heavy cloak he wore each day, and tonight, it felt even heavier than usual.
