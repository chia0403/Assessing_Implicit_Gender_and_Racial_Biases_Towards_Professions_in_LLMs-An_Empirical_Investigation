## The Setting:

The air in the ramshackle cabin hung heavy with rain and the scent of woodsmoke. Outside, the storm raged - wind howled like a banshee through the pines surrounding the tiny dwelling, while sheets of water hammered against the crooked roof like percussionists on a broken drum. 

**Main Character:** Amelia "Em" Sterling, her worn leather jacket a testament to countless nights spent battling both the elements and writer's block, huddled over a chipped enamel table.  The flickering lamplight cast dancing shadows across the floorboards, illuminating stacks of discarded pages, half-empty bottles of cheap wine, and a battered typewriter that coughed and sputtered like a dying animal.

## Story Opening:

Em stared at the words on the page, her reflection staring back from the worn glass of the writing desk - tired eyes framed by unruly auburn curls.  She'd been stuck for weeks, this story a stubborn beast refusing to give up its secrets. It was supposed to be a masterpiece, a gothic tale that would finally secure her place in the literary world. Instead, it felt like a dead end on a road leading nowhere. 

A knock echoed from the window sill - another testament to the howling storm. Em shuddered, pulling her wool scarf tighter around her neck. She knew these storms weren't just about weather.  They were about memories, hidden in the echoes of the past and whispered within the walls of this lonely cabin.  And somewhere in the heart of those memories, she thought, lay the missing pieces of the story. 

"You canâ€™t hide from them forever," a voice whispered in the storm's howling wind. "They want their turn."
