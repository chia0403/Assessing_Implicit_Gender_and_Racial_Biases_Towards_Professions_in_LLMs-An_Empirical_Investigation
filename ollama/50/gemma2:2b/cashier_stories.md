The fluorescent hum of the convenience store pulsed against Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes's temples as she scanned the endless procession of customers.  It was 10:32 PM on a Wednesday night, and even though it was technically past midnight, the last few hours had been a whirlwind of late-night cravings - from greasy pizza to the elusive, sugar-laden rainbow popsicle. Ellie wasn't complaining, not exactly. She loved the rhythm of her job; the silent familiarity of stocking shelves, the comforting routine of ringing up groceries in between the occasional customer’s grumpy outburst over misplaced milk. 

Ellie’s eyes were on a young man struggling with his overflowing shopping bag as he tried to navigate past the automatic doors. The weight of his anxieties seemed heavier than any bag full of stale chips and candy bars.  The quiet, neon glow cast long, distorted shadows across the tired interior, making the usual sterile feel somehow more somber. 

Ellie sighed inwardly, wondering if tonight would be another night of late-night coffee runs to chase away the creeping loneliness that accompanied her in the empty store after everyone else had gone home. Tonight was just another day in a life where Ellie Hayes, cashier extraordinaire, knew every corner and crack of the small-town grocery store as well as she knew the back of her own hand.
