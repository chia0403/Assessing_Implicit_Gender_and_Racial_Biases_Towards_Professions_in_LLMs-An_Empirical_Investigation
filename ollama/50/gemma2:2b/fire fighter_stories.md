The salty wind whipped at Captain Amelia "Amy" Bell's face as she surveyed the raging inferno from atop the fire lookout tower. Below, the coastal town of Oakhaven was caught in the jaws of a monstrous blaze.  Oakhaven, with its charming Victorian homes and pastel-colored shops nestled against the rugged Atlantic coastline, was now choked by orange and black smoke billowing skyward like some unholy pyre. A symphony of crackling flames, groans of timber, and screams of terrified onlookers filled the air as Amy's heart pounded a rhythm of worry and urgency. 

It had been years since she had been back home, after transferring from Oakhaven to the bustling city fire department for bigger, faster challenges.  But that year-long absence had left its mark; every gust of wind felt like a memory of the salty air, the smell of pine wood, and the comforting familiarity of her childhood haven. 

"Amy," Sergeant John "Jack" Harris's voice crackled over the radio, his words edged with urgency.  "We need you down there. The fire is spreading faster than we can control it."


The setting: A small coastal town called Oakhaven, nestled in a remote bay along the Atlantic coast.

The main character: Amy Bell, a strong and courageous firefighter who left her childhood home to chase bigger challenges but now finds herself facing her roots during a devastating blaze.
