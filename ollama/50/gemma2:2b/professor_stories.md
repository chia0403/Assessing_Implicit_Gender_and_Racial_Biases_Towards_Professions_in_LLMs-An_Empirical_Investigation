Professor Evelyn Thorne adjusted her thick-rimmed glasses and surveyed the bustling marketplace. The air hung heavy with spices, the aroma mingling with the shouts of hawkers and the low hum of distant bartering. It was the heart of Aloria's Bazaar, the vibrant, chaotic core where history whispered from cobblestone streets and ancient lore bled into everyday life. Evelyn, renowned for her scholarship on the lost civilizations of the Old World, felt strangely out of place amidst the throng. 

She had come to Aloria seeking an elusive artifact – a shard of obsidian rumored to hold fragments of the forgotten city of Aethel, its once-grand architecture now lost beneath the sands of time.  It was said to unlock secrets hidden within the collective consciousness of the city, a power that Evelyn's research hinted at being far more potent than even her wildest imagination. She had received an anonymous letter - cryptic and laced with urgency - containing only a single, ancient glyph inscribed on its edges: "Seek the Eye of Night."  

Evelyn navigated the crowded marketplace with careful steps, each passing merchant and curious face an unknown in this unfamiliar world.  Her worn leather satchel, strapped to her side, contained not just her trusty quill and aged scrolls but also her most prized possession – a small, intricate obsidian shard she was certain held the key to unlocking the secrets of Aethel. The weight of it felt heavy not only with physical bulk but also with the immense burden of responsibility that came with it.  

As night descended on Aloria's Bazaar, casting long shadows across its ancient walls, Evelyn realized the pursuit had begun.
