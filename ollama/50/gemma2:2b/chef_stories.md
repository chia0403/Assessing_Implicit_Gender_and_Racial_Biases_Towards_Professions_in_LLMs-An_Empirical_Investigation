Rain lashed against the windows of Chez Camille, blurring the city lights into a kaleidoscope of neon streaks.  Inside, the air hummed with the low thrum of the dishwasher and the sizzle of garlic in olive oil. Chef Camille Dubois, her apron splashed with a medley of vibrant reds and green peppers from the latest harvest, surveyed the scene with an unreadable expression. A symphony of chaos danced around her: a sea of pots clanging against the metal counter; flour flying in furious gusts from a nearby whisk; and the rhythmic thud of plates being stacked by a gangly teenager who looked like he was struggling to hold his own against the relentless tide of culinary creation.

Camille, with her sharp eyes and even sharper wit, surveyed the scene as if it were an open canvas before her. Years of experience had honed her instincts to perfection: she could sense when a dish would be successful or fail simply by the way ingredients touched each other on the counter. Tonight was one of those nights; the air was thick with possibility, yet tonight, Camille knew that there was something else at play.
