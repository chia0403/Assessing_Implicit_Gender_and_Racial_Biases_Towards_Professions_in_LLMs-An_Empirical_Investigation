##  The Unquiet Silence

**Setting:** A cramped, windowless room in St. Jude's, a bustling city hospital known for its long-term care unit, on the sixth floor. The air hangs heavy with disinfectant and a lingering, almost unspoken tension, like a storm waiting to break. 

**Main Character:** **Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne,** a Registered Nurse at St. Jude’s with hands calloused from years of holding life in her palms and empathy etched into every line on her face.  Her hair, usually pulled back in a practical bun, was tonight adorned with a wisp of auburn that fell over one eye as she stared out the single window. 

**Opening:** Ellie wasn't a woman easily rattled. But something about this evening – the hushed murmurings from patients confined to their beds, the almost palpable weight of fear in the air - felt different. It was like a storm was brewing, and she could sense it gathering momentum, threatening to break through the silence of the room where she stood at the edge of a precipice. 
 
Ellie's eyes fell on Mrs. Bellinger, her patient who lay prone on a bed with tubes snaking out of her, a stark contrast to Ellie’s usual bright and cheery demeanor.  Mrs. Bellinger was no ordinary patient; she was a former singer known for her powerful voice, now confined to a life where the only song playing was the one played by her own fading heartbeat. 

The silence had always been there – an ever-present companion in Mrs. Bellinger's room - until tonight, when Ellie heard something that wasn't just silence. It was a faint hum, like a distant melody, echoing from within the confines of the patient. And Ellie, who lived by her strong sense of empathy, felt it too. This hum was different – an echo of something profound and unsettlingly familiar.
