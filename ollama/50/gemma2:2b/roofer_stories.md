The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shed, each drop like a tiny fist striking against the canvas of sky trapped above him. Inside,  **Caleb "Cal" Thorn** squinted at the half-finished carpentry project before him. He was used to working under the open sky, but today felt different, as if the very air clung with an unyielding, almost oppressive pressure. 

He ran a calloused hand over his worn face - sun-baked and creased from years spent on rooftops. The weight of a storm that rolled through the valley, bringing down hailstorms and wind that ripped through the trees like angry claws, felt as heavy as the stack of lumber he'd been working on for days. It wasn't just the storm; it was something deeper, some unease gnawing at the pit of his stomach.  Cal hadn't been this unsettled since... well, he couldnâ€™t put a finger on it exactly. There was a lingering sense of foreboding in the air, like a shadow stretching across an otherwise clear sky. 

He glanced outside again, watching as the wind whipped around him and carried a hint of something distinctly unsettling - an almost metallic scent that stung his nostrils. The storm wouldn't be over for hours, but Cal knew he needed to finish this before he got swept away by the inevitable chaos. He rubbed his tired eyes and picked up a heavy plank, preparing himself for whatever awaited on the other side of this tempestuous day.
