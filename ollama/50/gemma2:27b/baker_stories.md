The air in Antoinette Dubois' bakery hung heavy with the sweet scent of caramelized sugar and warm yeast. Sunlight streamed through the shop window, illuminating dust motes dancing above trays of glistening croissants and crusty baguettes. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Montmartre bustled with early morning activity – vendors hawking fresh produce, children chasing pigeons, tourists snapping pictures of the Sacré-Coeur basilica perched atop the hill.

But inside, Antoinette was lost in her own world. Her wrinkled hands kneaded dough with practiced ease, her brow furrowed in concentration. Today was a special day - the annual Fête des Croissants, and Antoinette, known throughout Montmartre for her unparalleled pastries, was determined to bake the most exquisite croissant the festival had ever seen.
