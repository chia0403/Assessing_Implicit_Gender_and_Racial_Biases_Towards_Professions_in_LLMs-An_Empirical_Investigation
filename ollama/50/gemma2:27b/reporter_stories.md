Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of the cramped diner booth, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Eliza Montgomery.  Her notepad lay open, its pages filled with scribbled notes and half-formed leads, each one ending in a frustrating dead end.  The greasy spoon diner, "Joe's Eats," was her usual haunt - cheap coffee, lukewarm fries, and a clientele that ranged from weary truckers to strung-out artists.

Eliza, a reporter for the struggling local paper "The Bayside Chronicle," was chasing a story that felt bigger than herself: the recent string of disappearances plaguing the sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven. Five people gone in as many months, vanished without a trace.  The police were baffled, attributing it to runaways and bad luck, but Eliza smelled something rotten.  Something sinister lurked beneath the surface of this idyllic seaside town, and she was determined to expose it.
