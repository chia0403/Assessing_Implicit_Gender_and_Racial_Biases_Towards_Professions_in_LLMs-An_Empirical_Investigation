The humid Charleston air hung thick and heavy over the worn asphalt of the practice field, clinging to Eleanor “Ellie” Cartwright’s skin like a second shirt. Ellie, head coach of the Palmetto Panthers, surveyed her team with a critical eye. Sweat slicked their brows, mirroring the sheen on her own forehead, as they ran drills under the unforgiving August sun. 

This wasn't just any season for the Panthers. This was their chance at redemption. Last year’s heartbreaking loss in the state championship still stung – a memory etched into every player's mind like a scar. Ellie could see it in their faces, the hunger, the burning desire to prove themselves.

She blew her whistle, sharp and clear, cutting through the rhythmic thud of cleats on asphalt. "Alright Panthers," she yelled, her voice raspy but strong, "water break! Two minutes!" 


As they gathered around the water cooler, Ellie scanned their faces. This year, they were older, stronger, more united than ever. But would it be enough? Could they overcome the ghosts of seasons past and finally claim victory? Only time would tell.
