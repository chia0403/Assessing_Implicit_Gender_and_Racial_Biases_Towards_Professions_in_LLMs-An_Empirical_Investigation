The flickering fluorescent lights of St. Jude's Emergency Room cast harsh shadows on Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Thorne's tired face.  Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. A young boy lay on the gurney before her, pale and still, his chest barely rising with each shallow breath. Evelyn felt a familiar pang of helplessness. This was why she became a doctor - to mend the broken, to fight for life itself. But tonight, the odds seemed stacked against them. The boy's vitals were plummeting, and the cause remained stubbornly elusive.

Evelyn, a woman of science and logic, found herself praying, silently pleading with the universe for a miracle. Her fingers danced over the boy's clammy skin, searching for any sign of improvement.
