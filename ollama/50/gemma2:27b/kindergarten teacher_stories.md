The smell of crayons and desperation hung heavy in the air of Mrs. Eleanor Beatrice Kensington's kindergarten classroom. It was 3:07 pm, two minutes past dismissal, and chaos reigned. Timmy had somehow managed to glue his hand to his desk, little Lily wouldn't stop sobbing because someone had "stolen" her sparkly purple unicorn sticker, and a rogue goldfish named Bubbles had escaped its bowl and was currently flopping around on the carpet near the reading nook. Eleanor, with a deep breath and a forced smile plastered on her face, surveyed the scene. This was why she drank so much coffee.

Outside, the autumn sun cast long shadows across the playground as parents impatiently waited to collect their offspring. Eleanor longed for the quiet solace of her apartment, where she could curl up with a good book and forget about glitter explosions and impromptu goldfish rescues. But first, she had a classroom to wrangle.
