The rusted hinges shrieked in protest as Elara Thorne pushed open the heavy iron gate. A gust of wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the ancient oaks lining the path, sending shivers down her spine despite the summer heat. The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a smell that always seemed to cling to the crumbling walls of Blackwood Penitentiary. 

Elara adjusted the weight of her longsword on her hip and scanned the overgrown courtyard beyond. Even in broad daylight, shadows lurked in every corner, casting an unsettling gloom over the moss-covered stones. The hulking stone structure of the prison itself loomed above her, its jagged silhouette a stark reminder of the darkness it contained. Today was Elara's first day guarding Blackwood's notorious Cell Block D â€“ a wing reserved for the most dangerous and unpredictable inmates. A knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach.
