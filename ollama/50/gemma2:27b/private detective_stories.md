Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Alistair Finch's office, mimicking the storm brewing in his gut. The flickering neon sign outside cast an anemic glow on the overflowing ashtray and the half-empty bottle of scotch perched precariously on his desk. Alistair, a man whose face bore the map of countless late nights and questionable decisions, ran a hand through his thinning hair, already slick with sweat despite the chill in the air. 

The crumpled photograph on his desk, a woman's face obscured by shadow and rain, taunted him. Eleanor Vance. Missing for three days. Her husband, a man who reeked of old money and desperation, had thrown enough bills at Alistair to make him forget about the gnawing emptiness in his own life. But Eleanor's case felt different. There was something in her haunted eyes, even in the grainy image, that tugged at him.

Alistair swirled the remaining scotch in his glass, the amber liquid catching the feeble light.  He needed to get out of this claustrophobic space, breathe in some air that wasn't stale with regret and cheap whiskey. He had a feeling Eleanor Vance was more than just another missing person case. She was a puzzle begging to be solved, a ghost whispering promises of redemption. And Alistair Finch, weary as he was, couldn't resist her call.
