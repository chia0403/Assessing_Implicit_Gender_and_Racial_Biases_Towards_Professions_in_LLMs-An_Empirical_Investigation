The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine, clinging to Amelia Rose Dubois like a second skin as she stepped onto the rickety stage. The "stage" was more accurately described as a platform jutting out over a dusty courtyard in the heart of Marrakesh's ancient medina. Strings of fairy lights cast a hazy glow on the worn wooden planks beneath her feet, barely penetrating the velvet darkness that draped the surrounding walls.

Amelia adjusted the microphone, its metallic gleam an alien presence amidst the aged stone and faded tapestries.  A murmur rippled through the assembled crowd - a motley mix of tourists, locals sipping mint tea, and wide-eyed children perched on their parents' shoulders. Their faces were obscured in shadow, but Amelia could feel their expectant gazes boring into her. This was her first performance in Morocco, a far cry from the neon-lit clubs of New York City where she had honed her craft. Tonight, she wasn't just singing; she was weaving magic with her voice, trying to bridge the gap between two worlds.
