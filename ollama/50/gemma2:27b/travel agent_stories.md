The air conditioning unit in Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne's office wheezed like a tired rhinoceros, barely keeping the humidity at bay in the sweltering Charleston summer. Bea swiveled in her chair, the worn leather creaking in protest, and stared out the window at the overflowing flower boxes that decorated King Street. Tourists thronged the cobblestone sidewalks, their faces flushed from the heat and excitement of exploring the historic city. Bea sighed. It was peak season, yet she hadn't booked a single trip all week.

Her phone, usually buzzing with inquiries about honeymoons in Santorini and safaris in Kenya, lay eerily silent. The travel industry, once her haven, now felt like a shrinking island in a rapidly changing world. Online booking platforms had chipped away at her business for years, but the recent global pandemic had dealt a near-fatal blow.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled Bea out of her reverie. She straightened her floral blouse and plastered on a smile before calling out, "Come in!" A woman with windswept auburn hair and eyes that sparkled like sea glass stepped into the office, clutching a battered leather suitcase.
