The lobby of The Grand Astoria hummed with a nervous energy only present on New Year's Eve. Garlands of twinkling lights strung across the vaulted ceiling, casting shimmering reflections off the polished marble floor. A cacophony of voices mingled with the clinking of champagne glasses and the lilting melodies of a live jazz band tucked away in a corner alcove.

Elias Thornton adjusted his bowtie for the hundredth time, nervously smoothing down his freshly pressed uniform.  His nametag gleamed under the chandelier light: Elias Thornton, Bellhop. He was just one cog in the well-oiled machine that kept The Grand Astoria running smoothly, but tonight felt different. 

He watched as a couple in fur coats and glittering gowns waltzed past, their laughter echoing through the opulent space. A pang of longing twisted in his chest. Elias dreamed of being on that dance floor, not shuffling luggage up dusty stairwells. He yearned for something more than the predictable routine of bellhop life.

Tonight, however, fate seemed to have other plans. As a gaggle of giggling socialites tripped past, Elias caught sight of an intriguing figure approaching the reception desk: a woman cloaked in shadow, her face obscured by the wide brim of a velvet hat.
