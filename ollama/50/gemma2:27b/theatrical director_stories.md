The air hung thick with anticipation backstage at The Grand Majestic Theatre. Its velvet curtains, faded to the deep plum of a bruised sunset, awaited their cue.  A single spotlight sliced through the gloom, illuminating the face etched with worry lines and determination: Elara Sinclair-Rhodes, artistic director of the theatre for over two decades. 

Elara adjusted her spectacles, peering intently at the chaotic tableau before her. Costumers wrestled with last-minute alterations, actors mumbled lines under their breath, and stagehands scurried back and forth like frantic mice. Tonight was the premiere of "The Serpent's Tongue," a daring new adaptation of Shakespeare's Macbeth set in a dystopian future ruled by a ruthless AI overlord. 

This production was Elara's magnum opus â€“ a testament to her unwavering belief in theatre's power to transcend time and speak truths no matter the era. But tonight, doubt gnawed at her. The unconventional setting, the experimental staging, the reliance on cutting-edge holographic projections... it was all a gamble. Would the audience embrace Elara's vision, or would "The Serpent's Tongue" be silenced before it had a chance to hiss?
