Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the storm brewing within Dr. Elias Thorne. His office, usually a haven of calm with its muted colors and soft lighting, felt suffocating tonight. The scent of sandalwood incense, normally soothing, now seemed cloying.

Elias stared at the file in front of him – another case of crippling anxiety, another soul fractured by the relentless pressures of modern life. He'd spent years helping people navigate their inner turmoil, but lately, he felt a gnawing sense of futility. 

Was he truly making a difference? Or were his efforts like pebbles tossed into an endless ocean, destined to disappear without a trace? The question echoed in the silence of his office, amplified by the howling wind outside.

Then, a sharp rap on the door startled him. He glanced at the clock – 8:47 pm, well past his usual closing time.  Who could it be?
