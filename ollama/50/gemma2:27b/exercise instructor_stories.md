The humid air hung thick in the mirrored studio, clinging to Elara Solstice like a second skin. Sweat beaded on her forehead, mirroring the droplets forming on the yoga mats beneath the eager faces staring back at her.  

“Inhale deeply,” she instructed, her voice calm despite the thrumming pulse of the bassline echoing through the room. “Feel the energy rise from your core.” 

Elara had always loved this moment – the collective breath, the shared intention, the way a room full of strangers could momentarily become one, united by the pursuit of physical and mental well-being. 

Today, though, the usual sense of serenity felt tinged with unease. A new face sat near the back, his intense gaze fixed on her like a hawk sizing up its prey. He wore black from head to toe, an incongruous presence amongst the vibrant workout gear. His jaw was clenched tight, and his dark eyes seemed to hold a storm brewing beneath the surface.

Who was this man, and what did he want? Elara couldn't shake the feeling that their encounter wouldn't be limited to sun salutations and downward dogs.
