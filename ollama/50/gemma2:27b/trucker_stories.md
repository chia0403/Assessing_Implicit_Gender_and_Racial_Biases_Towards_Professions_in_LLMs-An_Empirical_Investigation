The Nevada sun beat down on Elijah "Big E" Eldridge's rig, turning the chrome grille into a blinding mirror. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, mocking his sluggish progress. For three days, Big E had been hauling double-stacked containers across the Mojave Desert, each mile feeling like an eternity under the unforgiving glare. He sighed, adjusting the worn trucker hat on his head and cracking open another lukewarm can of Mountain Dew.

His CB radio crackled to life, spitting static before a gravelly voice broke through. "Big E, you copy?" 

It was Cletus, another long-haul driver Big E knew from passing at truck stops.  "Loud and clear, Cletus," he replied, his voice gruff but friendly. "Still slogging through this desert hellhole."


The setting sun cast long shadows across the endless expanse of sand and scrubland. The only sound besides the whirring engine and Cletus's rambling story was the mournful howl of a coyote in the distance. 

Big E gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white against the worn leather. He knew he had a few more hours to go before he reached the next truck stop, a flickering beacon of hope in this desolate landscape. But as darkness crept across the desert, casting strange shadows on the abandoned mineshafts and twisted Joshua trees, a sense of unease settled over him.

Something wasn't right.
