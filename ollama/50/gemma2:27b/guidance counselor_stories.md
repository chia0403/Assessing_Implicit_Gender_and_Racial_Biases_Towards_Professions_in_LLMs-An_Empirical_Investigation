Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Ms. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  The stale air hung heavy with the scent of old coffee and desperation. Papers overflowed from overflowing trays, each one representing another lost soul navigating the treacherous waters of adolescence.  Eleanor sighed, rubbing a weary hand over her face. Outside, the late afternoon sun struggled to pierce through the grey clouds, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt of Northgate High’s parking lot. 

It had been a particularly grueling week. A string of college rejections, a heart-wrenching bullying incident, and a family crisis all converging on her small office like a confluence of misery. Eleanor, with her perpetually kind eyes and comforting smile, was the last bastion of hope for these troubled teens. Today, however, even she felt the weight of their burdens threatening to crush her spirit.  

A sharp rap on the door jolted her back to reality. “Come in,” she called, forcing a smile onto her lips. The door creaked open, revealing a young man standing awkwardly in the doorway. His shoulders were slumped, and his gaze darted nervously around the room. This was going to be another long afternoon.
