The relentless Aegean sun beat down on Elara Dimitriou's shoulders as she gestured towards the crumbling marble columns. "And these, my friends," she announced in her practiced, lilting English accent, "are the remnants of the Temple of Artemis, goddess of the hunt."

Elara scanned the faces before her, a mix of sunburnt tourists and wide-eyed students. Some were nodding politely, snapping photos with their phones. Others were already drifting off, bored by the heat and the endless history. She sighed inwardly. Leading tours through the ancient ruins of Ephesus was her dream job, but sometimes it felt more like herding cats than sharing a passion.


Today, however, something felt different. A strange energy pulsed beneath her feet, a tingling sensation that started at the base of her spine and spread throughout her body. It wasn't unpleasant, justâ€¦unexpected. As she continued her spiel about the temple's elaborate frescoes and its connection to the mythical Amazon warriors, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that something was stirring within the very stones around them.
