Dust devils danced across the parched expanse, swirling red dirt into miniature tornadoes. The sun beat down relentlessly on Caleb O'Connell's weathered face as he surveyed his land.  His calloused hands rested on the worn handle of his trusty walking stick, a gnarled branch from a long-dead cottonwood. His heart ached with the sight before him: brittle grasses struggling to survive, cattle ribs stark beneath their dusty hides. 

This was O'Connell Ranch, generations strong in the harsh embrace of West Texas. Caleb had inherited it from his father, and his father before him, men who knew how to wrestle sustenance from this unforgiving land. But this drought…this drought felt different. It gnawed at Caleb’s spirit like a hungry coyote. The creek that used to gurgle with life was now a cracked scar on the earth. Even the wind seemed to sigh in despair.  

Caleb needed rain. He needed it desperately, for his cattle, for his land, and for the legacy he carried on his stooped shoulders.
