Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Elias Thorne's chest. The flickering fluorescent light cast harsh shadows on the face of the man across from him - a gaunt figure with eyes that seemed to hold both defiance and a chilling emptiness. This was Anton Markov, accused of a string of brutal murders that had paralyzed the city. 

Elias, a seasoned forensic psychologist with the NYPD, had seen his fair share of darkness, but something about Markov's calculated silence, the almost imperceptible twitch in his right hand, sent a shiver down his spine. The evidence against Markov was circumstantial at best - eyewitness accounts were vague and contradictory, and the murder weapon remained elusive.

But Elias knew that behind the mask of indifference, there was a twisted mind waiting to be unraveled. He leaned forward, his gaze unwavering. "Mr. Markov," he began, his voice low and steady, "tell me about the night Sarah Davies disappeared."


The interrogation room, with its cold steel table and two unforgiving chairs, felt like a cage. Elias knew that within these walls, the battle for truth would be fought not with fists but with words, each syllable carrying the weight of a life lost.
