The pungent scent of lavender shampoo and stale coffee hung heavy in the air of "Curl Up & Dye," Amelia Rose Hawthorne's sanctuary. Outside, the July sun beat down on the cracked pavement of Elm Street, turning the world into a shimmering mirage. Inside, Amelia expertly wielded her shears, coaxing unruly curls into a cascade of auburn waves. The rhythmic snip-snip was punctuated by the hum of the hairdryer and the tinkling laughter of Mrs. Peabody, who was recounting the latest town gossip with gusto.

Amelia loved this rhythm, this familiar dance of scissors and chatter. Elm Street wasn't exactly glamorous, but it held a comforting predictability she craved. Still, a flicker of restlessness danced in her emerald eyes, a longing for something more than perfectly sculpted bobs and touch-ups on overgrown bangs.
