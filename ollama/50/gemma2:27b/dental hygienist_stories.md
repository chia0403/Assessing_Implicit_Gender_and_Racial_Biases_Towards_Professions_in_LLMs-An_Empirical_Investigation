The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's head, casting a sterile glow on the rows of gleaming metal instruments laid out before her. The faint scent of mint toothpaste mingled with the sharp tang of disinfectant, a familiar olfactory cocktail that usually signaled calm focus for Amelia. Today, however, her hands trembled slightly as she prepped Tray 4 for Mr. Henderson's cleaning.

Amelia worked in "Smiles on Elm," a cozy dental practice nestled between a bakery and a bookstore in the heart of Oakhaven.  It was a charming town, where everyone knew your name and gossip spread faster than cavities. But today, the usual humdrum of small-town life felt distant. Amelia's stomach churned with a mixture of excitement and dread. This wasn't just any routine cleaning. Today, Dr. Davies was out sick, leaving Amelia in charge for the first time.
