The fluorescent lights buzzed incessantly, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the linoleum floors of the Grand Blackwood Opera House.  It was well past midnight, the last echoes of applause long gone.  Elias Thorne, a man whose stooped shoulders and calloused hands spoke volumes of years spent scrubbing away the detritus of others' pleasures, pushed his overflowing mop bucket down the cavernous aisle.

The opulent red velvet seats, once teeming with elegant patrons, now sat empty, shadows stretching from their backs like mournful specters. Elias paused, leaning heavily on his battered mop handle, and gazed up at the stage. The gilded proscenium arch framed a vast emptiness, the silence broken only by the distant drip of a leaky faucet somewhere in the labyrinthine backstage.  He imagined, for a fleeting moment, the intoxicating rush of music, the vibrant costumes, the expectant hush before a prima donna's voice soared through the hall.

Tonight, however, there was only him, the echoing emptiness, and the lingering scent of stale perfume and forgotten dreams.
