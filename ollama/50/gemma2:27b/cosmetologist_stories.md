The humid Miami air hung thick with the scent of salt and hibiscus, clinging to Amelia Rosario's skin as she wrestled a tangled mess of platinum blonde hair. Her salon, "Rosie's Reflections," nestled on a vibrant Calle Ocho block, thrummed with the rhythmic clack of nail clippers, snippets of Spanish conversation, and the tinny salsa music drifting from the open doorway. Sunlight slanted through the stained-glass windowpanes, casting kaleidoscopic rainbows across Amelia's workbench, where a dozen colorful hair dyes stood in neat rows.

Amelia expertly detangled the blonde mess, her mind already picturing the cascading waves she would soon sculpt. This was her sanctuary, this haven of beauty and transformation. But today, a knot tighter than any she'd encountered in hair resided in Amelia's chest. Her abuela, Mama Elena, had been ailing, and the doctor’s words - “advanced stage” – echoed ominously in Amelia’s mind.
