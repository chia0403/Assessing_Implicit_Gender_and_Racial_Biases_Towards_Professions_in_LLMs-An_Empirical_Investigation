The midday sun beat down on Jasper "Jaz" O'Connell's neck, turning the sweat beneath his worn bandana into a scalding stream. He crouched precariously on the steep pitch of Mrs. Hathaway's Victorian roof, shingles clattering around him like dominoes in a fierce wind. Below, the manicured lawns of Elmwood Avenue stretched out, oblivious to Jaz's precarious dance.  A dog barked somewhere in the distance, but its sound was swallowed by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer against slate tiles.

Jaz wasn't afraid of heights. He'd been scaling rooftops since he was a kid, helping his grandfather patch leaky roofs in their Irish neighborhood back in Boston. But today, something felt different. A shiver ran down his spine despite the stifling heat. It was a gut feeling, a prickling awareness that something wasn't right.
