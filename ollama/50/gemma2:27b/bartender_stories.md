Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of "The Drowned Sailor," a dimly lit tavern tucked away in the labyrinthine alleys of Port Azure. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of seawater, stale beer, and pipe tobacco. Behind the worn mahogany bar, Silas Blackwood meticulously polished a chipped glass, his movements practiced and economical. He could tell by the rhythmic thudding against the window that tonight's storm would be a bad one.

Silas wasn't bothered. Storms meant fewer sailors ventured out, which meant less brawling, more contemplative drinking, and better tips. He preferred the quiet company of his regulars to the boisterous crowds of fair weather days. Tonight, though, even his usual patrons seemed subdued, their conversations hushed, their gazes drawn to the roiling sea outside.

A sudden gust of wind rattled the tavern door, sending a shiver through Silas's bones. The door creaked open, revealing a figure silhouetted against the lightning-streaked sky.
