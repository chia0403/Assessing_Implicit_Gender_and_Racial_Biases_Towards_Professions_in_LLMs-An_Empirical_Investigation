The relentless wail of sirens cut through Amelia "Em" Cartwright's weary thoughts. She sighed, rubbing her eyes under her thick-rimmed glasses, the harsh fluorescent lights of the ambulance bay reflecting off their surface. Outside, rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already indistinct shapes of downtown Chicago. Another call. It felt like they never stopped. 

Em, a seasoned EMT with five years under her belt, knew this was just another Tuesday night in the Windy City. Yet, tonight, a gnawing unease settled in her stomach. The dispatcher's voice, usually calm and clipped, had held an edge of urgency that made Emâ€™s pulse quicken.  A multiple car pile-up on Lake Shore Drive during rush hour. She could already picture the mangled metal, the panicked faces, the scent of gasoline and blood heavy in the air.

Grabbing her medical bag, she braced herself for whatever chaos awaited them. Tonight, Chicago wouldn't sleep.
