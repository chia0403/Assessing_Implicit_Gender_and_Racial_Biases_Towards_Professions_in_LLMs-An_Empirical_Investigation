The midday sun beat down on Silas Mordecaiâ€™s back as he chipped away at the rough granite. Dust billowed around him, catching the light and turning it into shimmering motes. The air hung heavy with the scent of crushed stone and sweat, a familiar perfume in this corner of the world. Silas worked with the focused intensity of a man who knew his craft intimately, each swing of his chisel purposeful and precise.

His workshop, tucked away in a cobbled alley behind the bustling marketplace of Aethelhelm, was a symphony of clanging metal, rasping stone, and the rhythmic thud of Silas' hammer. Sunlight filtered through a grimy skylight, illuminating the chaos of tools, half-finished sculptures, and towering blocks of marble and granite. Aethelhelm, a city carved from the heart of ancient mountains, hummed with life beyond the alley walls - merchants hawking their wares, children chasing pigeons in the square, the distant clang of the blacksmith's hammer. But for Silas, there was only the stone beneath his hand, waiting to be revealed. 

Today, he was working on a commission for Lord Alaric, a stern but fair nobleman who desired a statue of his late wife, Lady Elara. A delicate task indeed, for Silas knew the pain of loss all too well. His own beloved Amelia had passed five years ago, leaving him with only memories and the echo of her laughter in the silence of his workshop.
