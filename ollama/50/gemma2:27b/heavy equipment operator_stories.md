The Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Jackson's shoulders like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his already grease-stained shirt into a second skin. He squinted through the shimmering heat haze rising from the parched earth, watching as the massive Caterpillar excavator he piloted tore into the red clay hillside. Dust billowed around him, coating the world in an orange film.

Eli wasn't one for scenery. He preferred the symphony of grinding metal and roaring engines, the feel of the controls vibrating beneath his calloused fingers.  Out here on the edge of nowhere, carving a scar into the Nevada desert for a new highway project, he felt a strange sense of peace. It was just him, the machine, and the relentless sun.

But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of his neck made him pause the excavator mid-dig, the deafening roar fading to a low hum. He scanned the horizon, seeing nothing but scrubland and distant, hazy mountains. Still, the feeling persisted, an unease he couldn't shake off.

Then, a glint in the distance caught his eye. A flash of something metallic reflecting the sunlight. It was too far away to make out clearly, but it sparked a flicker of curiosity within Eli. Curiosity, and a growing sense of apprehension.
