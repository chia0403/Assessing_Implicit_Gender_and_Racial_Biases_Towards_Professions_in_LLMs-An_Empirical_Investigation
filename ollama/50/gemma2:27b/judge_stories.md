The gavel lay heavy in Judge Alistair Cavendish's hand, its polished rosewood reflecting the flickering gaslights of his chambers. The air hung thick with the scent of aging leather, pipe tobacco, and unspoken tension. Outside, the cobbled streets of London echoed with the clatter of carriages and the distant cries of hawkers, a symphony of the bustling city that felt miles away within these mahogany-paneled walls. Alistair stared out the window, his reflection superimposed on the foggy cityscape. Tonight, the weight of a thousand lives pressed down upon him, heavier than any legal precedent. The trial of Elias Blackwood had captivated the city, dividing opinion and sparking fervent debate in every tavern and drawing room. 

Blackwood, accused of heresy and witchcraft, sat awaiting his judgment in the dank confines of Newgate Prison.  Alistair knew the evidence was circumstantial, woven from whispers and superstition rather than concrete proof. Yet, the fear Blackwood instilled in the hearts of Londoners was undeniable, a palpable force that threatened to tear the city apart. 


The decision rested solely on Alistair's shoulders - a man known for his unwavering adherence to justice but haunted by a past he desperately tried to outrun. Could he, should he, condemn a man based on fear and rumour? Or would he risk everything to stand against the tide of hysteria engulfing the city?
