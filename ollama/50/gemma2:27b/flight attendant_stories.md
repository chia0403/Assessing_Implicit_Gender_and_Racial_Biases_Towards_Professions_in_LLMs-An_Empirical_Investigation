The stale air conditioning hummed its monotonous tune as Evangeline "Evie" Dubois wrestled with a stubborn overhead bin latch. Her perfectly coiffed bun threatened to unravel under the strain, mirroring the fraying edges of her patience. Outside the tiny porthole window, dawn bled across the horizon in a watercolour wash of orange and pink. Another sunrise, another flight. Evie sighed, the weariness settling deep in her bones despite the ever-present smile plastered on her face.

This wasn't the glamorous life she envisioned as a young girl, devouring travel magazines and dreaming of exotic locales.  The reality was cramped spaces, screaming babies, and passengers who treated her like a personal servant rather than a trained professional. Still, there were moments – fleeting glimpses of snow-capped mountains, the camaraderie of her fellow flight attendants, the occasional grateful smile from a passenger – that reminded Evie why she kept doing it. Today, however, those moments felt distant.

The flight was bound for Tokyo, a city she'd only ever seen in photos. A thrill, tinged with apprehension, ran through her. Maybe this time, she thought, maybe this flight would be different.
