Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of La Petite Cocotte, a rhythmic counterpoint to the sizzle of butter in Marcel Antoine Dufour's pan. The aroma of garlic and herbs mingled with the damp scent of the Parisian street outside, creating a unique perfume that only existed within these four walls.

Marcel, a man whose hands were as weathered as his copper pots, meticulously stirred a bubbling coq au vin. His greying hair was pulled back in a loose bun, revealing the lines etched around his kind, blue eyes – each wrinkle telling a tale of countless dishes created and savored. La Petite Cocotte wasn't fancy; it was tucked away on a cobblestone side street, its faded awning barely visible beneath strings of twinkling lights. 


But inside, magic happened. Marcel’s cooking transcended mere sustenance; it was an ode to tradition, a symphony of flavors passed down through generations. Tonight, however, the familiar rhythm felt off-kilter. A knot of unease tightened in Marcel's chest, mirroring the storm raging outside. He had a feeling tonight wouldn't be like any other night at La Petite Cocotte.
