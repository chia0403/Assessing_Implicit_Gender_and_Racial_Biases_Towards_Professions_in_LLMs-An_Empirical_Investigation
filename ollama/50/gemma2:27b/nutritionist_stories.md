Rain lashed against the windowpanes of The Nourishing Nook, blurring the vibrant colours of the organic vegetable display outside. Inside, Amelia Rose Kensington, with her auburn curls pulled back in a messy bun and flour smudged on her cheek from attempting (and failing) to bake gluten-free scones earlier that morning, sighed.  Another slow Tuesday. She glanced at the clock – 1:47 pm. Only one appointment scheduled today – Mrs. Peterson for a follow-up on her IBS management plan. Amelia hoped she’d have more clients soon.  

Opening The Nourishing Nook had been a dream come true, a chance to share her passion for wholesome food and empower people to make healthier choices. But six months in, the reality of running a small business was proving tougher than anticipated.  She needed to attract more clientele if she wanted to keep this little haven of wellness afloat. 

Suddenly, the chime above the door jingled, startling Amelia. A figure emerged from the rain-swept street, shaking water droplets from a tattered trench coat. The newcomer paused, looking around with wary eyes before approaching the counter. This wasn't Mrs. Peterson.
