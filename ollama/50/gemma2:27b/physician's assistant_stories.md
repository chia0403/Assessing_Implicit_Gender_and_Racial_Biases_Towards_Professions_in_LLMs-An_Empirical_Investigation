Rain lashed against the windows of the dilapidated clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor Ainsworth. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the waiting room crammed with anxious faces. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and desperation. 

Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight braid, chewed nervously on her bottom lip.  Being a physician assistant in rural Appalachia was rarely glamorous, but today felt different. The news from the neighboring town had spread like wildfire - a virulent strain of influenza was sweeping through the community, and Eleanor's clinic was the only one within a hundred miles.

She glanced at the overflowing triage board, each name scribbled hastily representing another life hanging in the balance. Fear tugged at her, but she pushed it down, drawing strength from the oath she had sworn to heal. This was her calling, her purpose - to stand against the tide of illness and offer hope where there seemed to be none. 


Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for the long night ahead. The storm raged on outside, but within those peeling walls, Eleanor Ainsworth would become a beacon in the darkness.
