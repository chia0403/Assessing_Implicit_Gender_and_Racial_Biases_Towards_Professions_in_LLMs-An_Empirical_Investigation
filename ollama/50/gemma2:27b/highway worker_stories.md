The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Ramirez's back as he chipped away at the crumbling asphalt. Sweat stung his eyes, but Eli refused to wipe it away, preferring to let it blur the endless ribbon of highway stretching before him. It was another scorching day in Yuma County, the air thick with the scent of dust and diesel. Eli glanced up at the skeletal steel beams of the half-built overpass looming overhead, a constant reminder of the never-ending work. 

His crew, a ragtag bunch of grizzled veterans and fresh-faced newbies, hammered and poured, their bodies moving in a rhythmic symphony of toil. The steady drone of machinery blended with the distant roar of truck engines, creating a soundtrack to Eli's life on the asphalt frontier. He loved the work, despite its hardships. There was something satisfying about shaping the earth, building a path for others to follow.  But today, an uneasy feeling gnawed at him. It wasn't the heat or the monotonous grind. Something felt different, off. Like the desert itself was holding its breath.
