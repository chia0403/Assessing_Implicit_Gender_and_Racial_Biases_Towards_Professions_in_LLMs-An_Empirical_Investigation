Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Now Massage Therapy, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an impressionistic smear. Inside, Emilia Rose Hawthorne kneaded tension from the knotted shoulder muscles of her client, Mr. Henderson, a retired accountant perpetually hunched over imaginary spreadsheets. The rhythmic tapping of raindrops and the soft hum of the diffuser filled the space, punctuated by the occasional sigh of relief escaping Mr. Henderson's lips. 

Emilia, with her sun-kissed skin and hair braided down her back like a river of ebony, worked with a quiet intensity. Her hands moved with an almost uncanny intuition, finding the hidden knots and releasing them with gentle pressure. It wasn't just muscles she was working on; Emilia believed in healing the whole person, mind, body, and spirit. 


But tonight, even her usual Zen-like calm was disrupted. The phone had been ringing incessantly since late afternoon, each call carrying a new layer of urgency. A strange unease prickled at the back of Emilia's neck, a feeling she couldn't quite shake.  Something wasn't right.
