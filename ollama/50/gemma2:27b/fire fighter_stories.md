Sirens wailed in the distance, their mournful cries echoing Eli's growing unease. This wasn't a standard kitchen fire; something felt off, primal.

He could hear the panicked shouts of his fellow firefighters as they wrestled hoses into place, their faces illuminated by the orange glow reflecting off the wet pavement.  The air crackled with tension, a tangible force pressing down on them all. Eli took a deep breath, steeling himself for the unknown. This was more than just another rescue; this felt like stepping into a nightmare.
