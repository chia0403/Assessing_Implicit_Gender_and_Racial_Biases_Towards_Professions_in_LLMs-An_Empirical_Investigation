The air hung thick with the smell of gasoline and ozone, a familiar cocktail to Elias "Eli" Blackwood. He wiped a greasy hand across his forehead, smearing sweat and engine grime into an abstract painting on his brow. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down mercilessly, baking the asphalt parking lot of Blackwood's Garage into shimmering waves. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling red dirt into miniature tornadoes. 

Eli squinted at the rusted hulk sprawled across his lift. A '67 Mustang, once a sleek predator, now slumped defeated, its chrome dulled and paint chipped. This beauty had seen better days, miles upon miles of hard living etched into its frame. Eli could practically hear the engine's ghostly growl, remembering a time when this car roared down desert highways with reckless abandon. He felt a twinge of sympathy for the forgotten machine, an understanding born from years spent tinkering and coaxing life back into neglected engines.

Today was shaping up to be another scorcher in Dust Devil Gulch, a small town where time seemed to move at a slower pace than the rest of the world. Eli knew most of his customers by name - ranchers with sputtering pickups, families with aging station wagons, and the occasional thrill-seeker with a souped-up motorcycle. He was their lifeline, keeping them rolling in a world where wheels meant freedom.
