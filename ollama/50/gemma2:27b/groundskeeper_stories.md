The rusted gate creaked open like a weary sigh, its hinges groaning in protest against decades of neglect. Edgar Fitzwilliam, his hands calloused and brown from years spent wrestling with stubborn weeds and unruly shrubs, pushed it further, allowing himself entry into the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor. The morning mist clung to the ancient oaks lining the drive, their skeletal branches clawing at the pale sky. A faint chill hung in the air, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. Edgar shivered, pulling his threadbare tweed jacket tighter around him.

Blackwood Manor loomed ahead, its grey stone facade shrouded in shadows. Once a grand estate, it now stood as a monument to forgotten grandeur, its windows dark and lifeless like vacant eyes. It had been years since anyone but Edgar had walked these grounds. The last of the Blackwood family had passed away decades ago, leaving behind only whispers of their opulent past and a legacy of overgrown gardens begging for care.

Edgar took a deep breath, the familiar scent of damp earth and decaying leaves filling his lungs. This place was more than just a job to him; it was a sanctuary, a refuge from the world's noise and clamour. He knew every inch of these grounds, from the hidden grotto nestled amongst the rhododendrons to the crumbling sundial forgotten in the rose garden.

Today, however, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickling unease that settled in his gut. As he trudged up the overgrown path towards the manor, Edgar couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone.
