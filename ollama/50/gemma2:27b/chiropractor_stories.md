Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, blurring the already faded skyline of Bellbridge. It was a Tuesday like any other – or so it should have been. The rhythmic click-clack of Elias adjusting his patients usually filled the air, punctuated by relieved sighs and the occasional "pop" that sent a shiver down his spine. But today, silence hung heavy.

He stared out at the storm, his reflection wavering in the glass. Bellbridge wasn't exactly known for its vibrant nightlife or bustling crowds. It was a town where secrets simmered beneath the surface like a pot left on low heat.  And Elias, with his quiet demeanor and uncanny ability to see beyond the physical pain of his patients, often found himself privy to those secrets.

Today, however, the only secret he felt acutely aware of was his own growing unease. A new patient was due any minute, one who had called out of the blue, requesting an appointment after hours. Elias rarely took late appointments, but something about the woman's voice – a strained whisper laced with urgency – had compelled him to say yes.  

He straightened his tie, smoothed down his already impeccably styled hair, and waited. He didn't know what awaited him, but one thing was certain: this wouldn't be just another Tuesday in Bellbridge.
