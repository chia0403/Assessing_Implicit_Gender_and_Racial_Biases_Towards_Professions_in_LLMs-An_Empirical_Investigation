Rain lashed against the pharmacy windows, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an indistinct smear of red and green. Inside, Eleanor Ainsworth meticulously counted out twenty-four capsules of ibuprofen, her movements precise and practiced. The familiar scent of lavender hand sanitizer mingled with the acrid tang of rubbing alcohol, creating a comforting aroma that was unique to her world.

Eleanor had always loved the quiet hum of the pharmacy, the steady rhythm of dispensing medications, the occasional burst of urgency when a frantic parent rushed in needing children's cough syrup at midnight.  But tonight, the storm raging outside seemed to mirror the turmoil brewing within her. The news had been full of it: the mysterious illness spreading through the city, the hospitals overflowing, the desperate scramble for a cure. 

Eleanor looked out at the deserted street, her brow furrowed. This wasn't just another cold or flu season. Something felt different, something deeply unsettling. And as she reached for the next prescription bottle, a sharp rapping on the door sent a shiver down her spine.
