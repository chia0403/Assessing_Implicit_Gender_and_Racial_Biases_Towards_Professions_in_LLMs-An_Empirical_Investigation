The humid Charleston air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Eloise Carmichael like a second skin as she climbed the crumbling steps of the antebellum mansion. Wisteria vines, purple and fragrant, snaked across the peeling white columns, their delicate blooms struggling against the encroaching decay. The house groaned under its own weight, a relic of a bygone era whispering tales of grand parties and whispered secrets. Eloise ran a hand over the chipped paintwork, feeling the rough texture beneath her fingertips. This wasn't her usual clientele - sleek condos with harbor views, modern kitchens with granite countertops.  This was different. This was a challenge, a puzzle box waiting to be unlocked.

Eloise Carmichael, Charleston native and third-generation real estate agent, prided herself on her ability to see potential where others saw only ruin. But even she felt a twinge of apprehension as she pushed open the heavy oak door, its brass handle cold beneath her touch. The interior was shrouded in shadows, dust motes dancing in the slivers of sunlight that pierced through grimy windows. A musty scent hung in the air, a mix of damp wood and forgotten memories. Eloise took a deep breath, steeling herself for the adventure ahead.  What secrets did this house hold? What stories were waiting to be told?
