Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the tempest raging inside his latest client.  Elias leaned forward, his hazel eyes filled with gentle concern as he listened to Sophia Ramirez recount her spiraling anxiety about an upcoming job interview. The scent of bergamot from his diffuser struggled in vain against the musky aroma of fear that seemed to cling to Sophia like a shroud. Outside, the neon sign of "Thorne & Associates: Counseling for Life's Storms" flickered erratically, mirroring the uncertainty swirling within the room.
