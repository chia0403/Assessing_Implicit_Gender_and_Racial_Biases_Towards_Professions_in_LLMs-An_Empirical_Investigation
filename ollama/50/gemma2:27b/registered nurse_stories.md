Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Emergency Room, blurring the city lights into a shimmering haze. Inside, the air crackled with urgency. Monitors beeped their insistent rhythm, fluorescent lights hummed overhead, and the constant shuffle of nurses' shoes on linoleum created a steady counterpoint to the symphony of sirens wailing outside. Eloise Beaumont, her dark curls escaping from their usual braid, adjusted her mask and hurried towards Trauma Bay 3. The patient, a young man with a gash across his forehead and glazed eyes, needed attention â€“ now.  Eloise's heart hammered in her chest, a familiar mix of adrenaline and empathy surging through her veins. This was why she became a nurse, to be the calm amidst the storm, the steady hand guiding patients back to health. Tonight, she felt that calling more strongly than ever.
