The fluorescent lights hummed a ceaseless melody above Evelyn Rose Cartwright's head as she scanned another gallon of milk. The familiar beep echoed through the cavernous supermarket aisle, blending with the tinny pop song warbling from the overhead speakers and the muffled sobs emanating from Aisle 7.  Evelyn didn't bother looking. Crying customers were practically a Tuesday staple at FoodMart #42. She sighed inwardly, wishing she could swap places with the distressed shopper for just five minutes â€“ anything to escape the monotony of her shift. Outside, the sun dipped low, casting long shadows across the asphalt parking lot. The air, thick with the scent of exhaust fumes and wilting petunias from the neglected flower display near the entrance, promised a stifling summer night. Evelyn longed for something different, something beyond the endless parade of cereal boxes, discount coupons, and the weary faces of her fellow cashiers.  Tonight, she was determined to find it.
