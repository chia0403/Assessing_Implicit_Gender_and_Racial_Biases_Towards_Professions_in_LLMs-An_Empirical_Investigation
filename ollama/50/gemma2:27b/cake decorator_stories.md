The humid Louisiana air hung thick as Ambrosia Fontaine surveyed her latest creation: a towering five-tiered wedding cake adorned with sugar orchids so delicate they seemed to quiver in the gentle breeze from the ceiling fan. Sunlight streamed through the bakery window, illuminating swirls of buttercream frosting and scattering diamond dust across the countertop. Outside, Bourbon Street buzzed with its usual chaotic symphony â€“ a brass band's jaunty melody competing with the rhythmic clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the laughter of tourists spilling out of bars.

Ambrosia, however, was lost in her own world, meticulously adjusting a single sugar petal with the practiced precision of a surgeon. This wasn't just any cake; it was for the daughter of Madame Evangeline LaCroix, New Orleans' most revered Voodoo priestess. Ambrosia knew every detail had to be perfect, imbued with the subtle magic that infused everything in this city.
