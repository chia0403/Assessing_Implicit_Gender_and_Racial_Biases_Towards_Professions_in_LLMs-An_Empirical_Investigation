The opulent marble lobby of The Gilded Spire shimmered under a thousand tiny lights, reflecting off Eleanor Beatrice Blackwood's perfectly coiffed silver hair. Outside, the storm raged, lashing wind against the towering glass windows and momentarily obscuring the glittering cityscape below. Inside, however, it was a haven of hushed elegance, punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. Eleanor, as she always did, stood sentinel at her post, a beacon of composure amidst the swirling chaos of the city outside.

Tonight, though, something felt different. The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a tremor beneath the veneer of luxury that even the thickest Persian rugs couldn't muffle. As Eleanor smoothed down the lapels of her immaculately tailored navy uniform, a shiver ran down her spine – not from the cold, but from a premonition she couldn’t quite decipher.  

A gust of wind howled, momentarily plunging the lobby into darkness before the emergency lights flickered on. Just then, the grand double doors swung open with a theatrical bang, revealing a figure silhouetted against the storm's fury. Eleanor straightened, her intuition screaming that this was no ordinary guest.
