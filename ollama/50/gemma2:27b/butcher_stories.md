The air hung heavy with the metallic scent of blood and the earthy aroma of sawdust.  Morning light slanted through the grime-coated windows of "Finnegan's Fine Meats," illuminating dust motes dancing in the frigid air. Bartholomew Finnegan, a man built like an ox with hands calloused from years of cleaving bone and sinew, surveyed his domain with a critical eye. 

Today was market day, the busiest of the week for Bartholomew's small butcher shop nestled on the cobbled backstreets of Dunhaven.  The town, perched precariously on the edge of a windswept moor, was known for its hardy folk and even hardier livestock. Bartholomew prided himself on supplying them with the finest cuts, each one a testament to his skill and years spent apprenticed under his gruff but revered father.


As the first customers began to trickle in, their breath puffing white clouds in the cold air, Bartholomew hefted a cleaver, its blade gleaming ominously under the dim shop lights.  A quiet smile played on his lips. Today promised to be a good day.
