The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint tang of mildew creeping from beneath the antique chaise lounge. Elara Finchworth sighed, her breath fogging the ornate silver mirror she was polishing. The grand drawing-room of Blackwood Manor, though breathtakingly beautiful, felt like a tomb today. Outside, the October wind howled and rain lashed against the mullioned windows, mimicking the storm brewing in Elara's chest. 

Five years she had worked here, five years dedicated to keeping this crumbling monument to past glories gleaming. Five years since her husband, Thomas, had been taken by the sea, leaving her alone with a gaping hole in her heart and the weight of their meager savings on her shoulders. Blackwood Manor had offered refuge, a steady paycheck, and anonymity amongst the endless corridors and hushed rooms. But today, the solitude felt suffocating. 


Elara glanced at the grandfather clock ticking away relentlessly in the corner, each chime a sharp reminder of time passing, of her own life slipping by unnoticed. A letter lay unopened on the mahogany sideboard, its creamy envelope stamped with the familiar crest of the Blackwood family - her employers. It was probably another request for an impossibly detailed cleaning schedule or a new recipe for Lady Blackwood's "delicate" constitution. But today, Elara felt a spark of rebellion ignite within her. Today, she craved something more than dusting and polishing, more than the shadows and silence that enveloped her.
