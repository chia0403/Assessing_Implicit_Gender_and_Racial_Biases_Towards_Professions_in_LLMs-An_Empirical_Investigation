The flickering fluorescent lights of Harold "Harry" Fitzwilliam's cramped office cast long, skeletal shadows across the mountain of receipts and W-2 forms piled on his desk.  Outside, the relentless April sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, turning Harry's beat-up Chevy Nova into a miniature oven. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation - the pungent aroma of tax season.

Harry tugged at his threadbare tie, a relic from his brief stint in corporate accounting before he realized he preferred the company of numbers to people.  He glanced at the clock ticking ominously on the wall â€“ 8:57 pm. Just three minutes until closing time. His stomach growled, reminding him that dinner had been a hastily devoured bowl of instant ramen at his desk.

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, sending a shiver down Harry's spine.  He knew that sound all too well. It was the sound of procrastination, the sound of someone who had waited until the last possible minute to deal with their tax burden. And Harry, despite his years of experience and stoic demeanor, secretly dreaded these eleventh-hour clients.
