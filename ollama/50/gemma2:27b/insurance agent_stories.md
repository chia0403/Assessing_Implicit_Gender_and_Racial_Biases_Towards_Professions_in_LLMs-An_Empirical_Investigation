Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Reginald Fitzwilliam's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of stale coffee and desperation. Reginald, a man whose tailored suits couldn't disguise the weariness etched into his face, stared at the overflowing inbox on his desk. Each manila folder represented another family teetering on the edge, their hopes pinned precariously on a claim he had to approve or deny.

His office, tucked away in a forgotten corner of a dilapidated building downtown, was a testament to his declining fortunes. The once-plush carpet was now threadbare and stained, the paint peeling like sunburned skin. A lone, flickering fluorescent light cast long, ominous shadows across the room, amplifying Reginald's sense of isolation. 

Today was different, though. Today, a file sat on his desk unlike any other. It wasn't just the exorbitant sum insured or the unusual circumstances surrounding the claim. It was the name: Evangeline Thorne. A name that whispered of forgotten secrets and perilous adventures. A name that ignited a flicker of curiosity in Reginald's weary heart.
