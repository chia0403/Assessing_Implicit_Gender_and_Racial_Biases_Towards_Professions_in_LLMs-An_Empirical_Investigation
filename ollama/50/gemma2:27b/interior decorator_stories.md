The insistent trill of Amelia Blackwood’s phone echoed through the cavernous loft apartment. Sunlight streamed through the enormous arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting sharp shadows from the vintage furniture Amelia had carefully curated. She sighed, pushing away a stack of fabric swatches and reluctantly answering the call.

“Amelia Blackwood, Interior Design extraordinaire,” she announced with mock formality, her voice tinged with annoyance. It was Friday afternoon, and all she wanted was to finally collapse on the velvet chaise longue she’d just reupholstered for her latest project. 


The voice on the other end belonged to Mrs. Davenport, a notoriously demanding socialite known for her opulent parties and equally opulent taste. Amelia braced herself. Whatever Mrs. Davenport needed, it would be extravagant, time-sensitive, and likely involve a dozen impossible requests.

"Amelia, darling," Mrs. Davenport purred, "I simply must have you at my chateau this weekend. The annual Spring Gala is approaching, and I'm in dire need of your magic touch."
