Rain lashed against the windows of the cozy brick cottage nestled on the edge of the windswept Yorkshire moors. Inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Cavendish-Jones meticulously adjusted the pulley system for her latest patient, a gruff sheep farmer named Arthur struggling to regain mobility after a nasty fall from his tractor.  

The scent of damp wool and woodsmoke lingered in the air, punctuated by the comforting tick of the grandfather clock in the corner. Ellie's small practice was a haven for those seeking solace and recovery amidst the rugged beauty of the moors. While the howling wind outside mirrored Arthur's frustrated groans, Ellie remained a beacon of calm, her warm smile and steady hands inspiring hope where there had been none before.
