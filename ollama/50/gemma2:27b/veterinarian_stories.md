Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. Eleanor Vance grimaced, pushing a stray curl back under her worn baseball cap. The power flickered, momentarily plunging the examination room into an eerie gloom before sputtering back to life. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the scraggly pines that lined the dirt road leading to her clinic. 

It was just another Tuesday night in Pine Ridge, Wyoming, a town so small it barely registered on most maps. Eleanor loved the rugged beauty of the place, the untamed wilderness that stretched for miles beyond the last ramshackle farmhouse. But tonight, she wouldn't have minded trading the howling wind and incessant rain for a crackling fire and a good book.

The bell above the door jingled, startling her. A figure, obscured by the gloom of the doorway, hesitated on the threshold. Eleanor straightened, wiping her hands on her grease-stained apron. "Come in, come in," she called out, her voice carrying a warmth that belied the chill in the air. "Don't let the weather keep you from your furry friends."
