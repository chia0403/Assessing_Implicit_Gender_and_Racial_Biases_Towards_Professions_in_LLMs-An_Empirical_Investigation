The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rainbow alphabet chart hanging crookedly above the whiteboard.  Eleanor Rose Finch smoothed down her floral print dress, attempting to ignore the way it clung slightly to the humid August air. It was back-to-school day at Sunnyside Elementary, and Eleanor felt a familiar knot of anxiety twist in her stomach. This year felt different. Different from the excited chatter bubbling from her fifth graders last year or the shy smiles of the kindergarteners she'd taught two years prior. 

This year, Eleanor was assigned to teach fourth grade. The infamous "tween" years, where childhood innocence started to fade and hormones began their unpredictable dance. She took a deep breath, reminding herself why she loved teaching. It wasn't about perfect lesson plans or standardized test scores. It was about igniting curiosity, fostering empathy, and helping young minds blossom.
