The rusty groan of ancient pipes echoed through the cramped basement, a symphony only Bartholomew “Bart” Higgins truly appreciated.  He knelt on the damp concrete floor, his forehead creased in concentration as he wrestled with a stubborn valve, its brass encrusted with decades of mineral buildup. Outside, the July sun beat down mercilessly on the Victorian house perched precariously on the hill overlooking Charleston Harbor. The air inside was thick and humid, carrying the scent of mildew and something vaguely metallic – a hint that Bart's next adventure might involve more than just a leaky faucet.

He tightened his grip on the wrench, muttering a prayer to the plumbing gods for guidance. This wasn’t your average call; Mrs. Agatha Hawthorne had insisted it was an "urgent matter" involving a "ghostly presence" emanating from her pipes. Bart, a pragmatic man who believed firmly in gravity and good copper piping, scoffed inwardly at the notion of specters haunting his domain. Still, Agatha Hawthorne paid well, and her trembling voice on the phone had stirred something akin to pity in his gruff heart.
