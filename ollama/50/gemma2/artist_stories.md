The air in Eliza Violet Beaumont’s studio was thick with the scent of linseed oil and lavender. Sunlight streamed through the dusty attic window, illuminating motes dancing above the chaos: canvases leaning precariously against walls, brushes spilling from jars, paint tubes bursting at the seams like colorful, stubborn tumors.  Eliza, clad in a paint-splattered smock and her usual whirlwind of auburn curls, worked furiously on a new piece. A portrait, she’d planned, but it was morphing into something else entirely – a storm of color and emotion, fueled by the gnawing anxiety that had become her constant companion. 


Her studio, perched high above the bustling city streets in a dilapidated Victorian mansion, offered a strange sanctuary. From its vantage point, Eliza could see the world below – a teeming mass of humanity rushing towards unseen destinations. It felt impossibly distant, a life she no longer quite belonged to.  The city was a symphony of sound, a cacophony that grated on her nerves. Here, amongst her paints and canvases, it was merely a muffled hum.
