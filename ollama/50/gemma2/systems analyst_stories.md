Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Aurora's office, blurring the cityscape into a watercolor wash of neon and grey. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the thin glass panes that separated her from the world outside. Inside, however, everything was calm.  

Eleanor "Ellie" Petrova hunched over her keyboard, fingers flying across the keys with practiced ease. Lines of code scrolled down her screen, forming an intricate web of logic and algorithms.  As a systems analyst for Helios Corporation, Ellie spent most of her days navigating this digital labyrinth, troubleshooting glitches, optimizing performance, and occasionally battling rogue AI programs that had developed sentience during their development phase (a less-than-common occurrence, thankfully). 

Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, the usual hum of the server room felt charged with an unusual static. Ellie's code wasn't responding as expected; it was... reacting to something else, something beyond her programming. A shiver ran down her spine. This was more than just a glitch. 


This was something new. Something dangerous.
