The rasp of chisel against granite echoed through Elias Thorne's workshop like a heartbeat. Sunlight slanted in through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows from the half-finished sculptures scattered around the room. A symphony of scents filled the space: the earthy aroma of stone dust mingled with the tang of sweat and the faint sweetness of pipe tobacco. Elias, his hands calloused but surprisingly nimble, worked on a bust of Queen Elara, her stern visage slowly emerging from the rough block of white marble. 

His workshop wasn't grand â€“ just a single room tucked away in the bustling city of Veridia, its walls lined with shelves holding tools, pigments, and sketches. But for Elias, it was his haven, a place where he could lose himself in the silent conversation between stone and sculptor. His creations weren't merely replicas; they were whispers of souls captured in cold, enduring form.

But today, a shadow hung over the workshop. A raven had perched itself on the sill, its obsidian eyes fixed on Elias with an unnerving intensity. The bird croaked once, a harsh, discordant note that sent a shiver down his spine. He knew ravens were harbingers of change, but what kind of change did this one foretell? He couldn't shake the feeling that his quiet life, dedicated solely to art, was about to be irrevocably altered.
