The air in the cramped shack vibrated with a low hum, the sound punctuated by the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia "Amy" Everly's tools against metal casing. Outside, the howling wind tore at the makeshift canvas walls, threatening to rip away the fragile barrier between her and the desolate Alaskan wilderness.  

Amy squinted through the gloom, her headlamp casting a narrow beam across the workbench cluttered with salvaged radios, antennas, and tangled wires. The storm had knocked out the main communication line hours ago, leaving their small research station in complete isolation. The radio she was working on, a hulking relic from the Cold War era, held their only hope of contacting the outside world. 

Her calloused fingers delicately adjusted a wire connection, sending a jolt of electricity through the machine. A crackle, then a burst of static filled the air.  Amy's heart leaped - a faint signal.
