The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and gasoline, a familiar perfume to Emilia "Em" Hayes as she bent over a rusted engine block. Grease stained her worn overalls and smudged her forehead, but she didn't mind. Her calloused fingers danced across the metal, diagnosing the problem with the practiced ease of someone who'd spent their life under hoods.

The setting sun cast long shadows through the open garage door of "Hayes' Haven," Em’s independent auto repair shop nestled on a dusty backstreet in the sleepy town of Harmony Ridge, Montana. Its faded blue paint and mismatched signs advertised everything from "Honest Repairs" to "Coffee Always Brewed."  Beyond the rusted tools and overflowing parts bins, life hummed with a comforting rhythm. The faint strum of an old guitar drifted in from the radio, while Em’s tabby cat, Gus, snored contentedly on a pile of discarded tire treads. 


Harmony Ridge was a town where everyone knew their neighbor's name, and word traveled faster than a rusty pickup truck down Main Street.  Em had built her reputation on reliability and fairness, fixing everything from beat-up farm tractors to Grandma's sputtering station wagon. Tonight, however, the air held a different kind of energy, a sense of unease that settled like a layer of dust over the familiar workshop. Em glanced at the clock, its ticking hands reminding her that the day was drawing to a close. But as she reached for her coffee mug, a figure emerged from the gathering dusk, silhouetted against the setting sun. 


Em's brow furrowed. She didn't recognize the stranger, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.  He walked with a measured stride, his boots crunching on the gravel driveway. He stopped just inside the garage doorway, a figure shrouded in mystery, and spoke.

"I hear you fix anything," he said, his voice low and gravelly like shifting sand. "And I have something that needs fixing."
