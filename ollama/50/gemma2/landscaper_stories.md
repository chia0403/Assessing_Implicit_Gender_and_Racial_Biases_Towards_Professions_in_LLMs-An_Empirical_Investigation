The air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and honeysuckle, a perfume that usually brought Amelia Rose Hawthorne joy. Today, though, it only served as a reminder of the weight pressing down on her shoulders. The late summer sun beat mercilessly down on the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Estates, casting long, wavering shadows from the towering oak trees lining the streets. 

Amelia, her brow slick with sweat, gripped the edge of her trusty pruning shears. She surveyed the immaculately kept gardens, each one a testament to the affluent residents who resided here, oblivious to the struggles brewing beneath the surface of their manicured lives. Her own life, far from pristine, was tangled like the overgrown rose bushes she was supposed to be trimming. 


Oakhaven Estates wasn't just another job for Amelia. It was a battlefield where her talents were constantly tested, her skills judged, and her resilience pushed to the limit by demanding clients and their impossible expectations.
