Her small clinic in rural Appalachia was bathed in the weak morning light filtering through dusty windows, revealing a scene of organized chaos. Charts lay open on her desk, a half-eaten granola bar rested precariously on its edge, and a forgotten stethoscope dangled from the back of her chair. A single whirring sound filled the silence - the antique fan struggling to combat the oppressive heat.

She had Mrs. Henderson's persistent cough, young Billy Jones with his twisted ankle from football practice, and a new face – Mr. Thompson – who seemed troubled by something more than just a physical ailment. Elara always prided herself on being able to read people, their unspoken anxieties etched in the lines around their eyes, the way they shifted on the worn examination table. Today felt different; the air hummed with an underlying tension, a sense of unease that settled like a cold draft despite the sweltering heat.
