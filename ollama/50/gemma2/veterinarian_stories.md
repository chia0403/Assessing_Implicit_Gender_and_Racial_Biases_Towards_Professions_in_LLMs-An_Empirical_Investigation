The salty tang of the ocean air hung heavy in Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Finch's nostrils as she stepped out onto the porch of the Seagull Sanctuary.  Sunrise painted the sky in hues of apricot and lavender, casting long shadows from the weathered wood of the building. The sleepy coastal town of Oakhaven, nestled between rolling green hills and the vast expanse of the Atlantic, was just beginning to stir. 

Ellie inhaled deeply, letting the crisp air fill her lungs. It was a sound and scent she never tired of - the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore, the cries of gulls wheeling overhead, the salty breeze carrying whispers of seaweed and seagrass. This was home.  This was where she belonged. 

Seagull Sanctuary wasn't your typical veterinary clinic. Ellie specialized in avian care, treating everything from injured shorebirds to rescued parrots with forgotten tales. Her small practice thrived on donations and volunteer hours, a testament to the town's love for its feathered residents and Ellie's unwavering dedication.  


As she walked towards the clinic, her worn leather boots crunching on the gravel path, Ellie could hear the familiar chirps and squawks of her patients, a cacophony of welcome in the early morning light. Today was going to be another busy day at the sanctuary. But for Ellie, there wasn't anything more fulfilling than tending to these creatures, their lives entrusted to her capable hands.
