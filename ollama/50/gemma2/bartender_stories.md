The neon sign flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked pavement outside The Rusty Mug. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale beer and desperation.  Evelyn “Eve” Blackwood leaned against the worn mahogany counter, her emerald eyes scanning the bar's few patrons. A lone trucker in a faded trucker hat nursed a lukewarm whiskey, his face etched with exhaustion. Across from him, a pair of college students giggled nervously over half-empty pitchers of something brightly colored and potent. Eve sighed, the air puffing out her cherry red lipstick.  This was Tuesday night at The Rusty Mug - slow, predictable, and about as exciting as watching paint dry. 


The Rusty Mug itself was a relic from a bygone era, tucked away in a forgotten corner of downtown Seattle. Its faded brick facade hinted at its age, and the mismatched furniture spoke to years of hard-lived stories. A worn velvet curtain separated the bar from a small backroom, rumored to hold secrets both scandalous and mundane.
