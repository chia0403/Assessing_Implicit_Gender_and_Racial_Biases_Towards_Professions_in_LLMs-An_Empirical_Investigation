The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Quince's overalls like a second skin as he surveyed his domain.  The sprawling gardens of Elmwood Manor were his kingdom, each rose bush, meticulously pruned hedge, and vibrant patch of petunias under his watchful eye. He inhaled deeply, the air thick with the earthy scent of damp soil and dew-kissed roses. 

Bartholomew Quince wasn't your typical groundskeeper.  His weathered hands, calloused from years of toil, also held a surprising deftness, capable of coaxing the most delicate blooms to life. He understood the language of trees, the whisper of wind through leaves, and the silent stories etched into the bark of ancient oaks.  But Bartholomew carried a secret, a burden that weighed heavier than any pruning shears: he was a descendant of the manor's original owners, bound by an unspoken oath to protect the grounds from a darkness that threatened to consume them.
