The flickering neon sign outside "Byte Me," the local coffee shop, cast an electric blue haze over Evelyn Aisling Murphy's tired face. She rubbed her eyes, trying to banish the lingering afterimages from another all-nighter spent wrestling with lines of code. Her latest project, a complex AI assistant designed to predict stock market trends, was proving more stubborn than she anticipated. 

Evelyn lived above "Byte Me," a cramped apartment overlooking a bustling alleyway in the heart of Dublin's tech district. The city pulsed with a frenetic energy that both energized and exhausted her. Rain slicked the pavement outside, reflecting the kaleidoscope of colours from the nearby pubs, their windows glowing like beacons in the growing darkness. 

Evelyn took a long gulp of lukewarm coffee, its bitter taste doing little to dispel the lingering fog in her head. She glanced at her laptop screen, the lines of code swimming before her eyes. The deadline loomed â€“ if she couldn't get this AI working, not only would she lose the lucrative contract, but her entire freelance career could crumble.  

She needed a break, a fresh perspective. Maybe a walk down to the river, breathing in the damp air and listening to the rhythmic lapping of the water against the stone.
