The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and stale cigarette smoke in the opulent lobby of The Grand Palais.  A low hum of conversation filled the space, punctuated by the occasional clink of champagne glasses and the rhythmic strumming of a lone guitarist in the corner. 

Seraphina Eloise Beaumont, or "Sera" as she preferred, surveyed the scene from behind the polished mahogany concierge desk. Her perfectly-coiffed auburn hair was pulled back in a sleek chignon, highlighting the delicate silver earrings that shimmered with each movement of her head.  She wore a midnight blue tailored suit, crisp and immaculate, a silent testament to her dedication to order and precision in this whirlwind of chaos. 

Sera had seen it all during her years at The Grand Palais: clandestine meetings, extravagant parties, whispered scandals, and the occasional stolen kiss in the shadows. Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, like a storm brewing just beyond the shimmering curtain of crystal chandeliers. And Sera knew, with the certainty that only comes from years spent observing the human drama unfold, that tonight's guests wouldn't be leaving empty-handed.
