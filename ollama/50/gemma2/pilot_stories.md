The air thrummed with anticipation, a symphony of screeching hydraulics and crackling comms that only Captain Evelyn Vance understood as music. Her calloused fingers tightened around the throttle of the X-73 Raptor, its sleek titanium frame glinting under the harsh glare of Kepler-186f's twin suns. The red dust of the barren landscape swirled around the landing platform, a constant reminder of the harsh reality of this outpost on the edge of civilization. 

Kepler-186f was a world carved from rock and wind, where life clung tenaciously to scarce resources and danger lurked in every shadow.  It was also home to Vance's most recent assignment: ferrying vital supplies across the unforgiving terrain, a job that demanded precision and nerves of steel. 


The comms crackled again, shattering the tense silence. "Raptor One, this is Command. You have clearance for takeoff. We await your arrival at Site Epsilon."

Vance's jaw tightened. Site Epsilon. A desolate research outpost on the edge of a known anomaly - a swirling vortex in the planet's magnetic field that scientists believed held the key to unlocking faster-than-light travel.  A dangerous assignment, even for someone like Vance, who thrived on pushing boundaries and defying the odds.
