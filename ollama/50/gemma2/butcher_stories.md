The air in Edgar "Eggy" Beaumont's shop hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary. Not an unpleasant smell, mind you, just potent. It clung to Eggy like a second skin, a badge of honour earned through years spent wielding cleavers and carving out a living on the cobbled streets of Grimsborough. 

Grimsborough itself was a town caught between eras: Victorian architecture with gaslight street lamps stood shoulder-to-shoulder with modern pubs boasting neon signs. It was a place where tradition clung stubbornly to progress, just like Eggy's own weathered apron and the ancient meat slicer he swore by. Outside his shop window, the midday sun glinted off the cobblestones, illuminating a world of rushing feet and gossiping housewives.  But inside Eggy's stall, time seemed to slow. The rhythmic thumping of his cleaver against bone was the only sound that punctuated the silence, a steady heartbeat in the quiet hum of Grimsborough.
