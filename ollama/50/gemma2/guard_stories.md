The rusted bars of Gate Three scraped against Sergeant Elara Valenâ€™s gauntleted hand as she climbed down the crumbling watchtower. The air hung heavy with the scent of salt and decay, the usual aroma of Havenport after a storm. Rain slicked the cobblestones below, turning the normally bustling marketplace into a treacherous reflection of the gray sky. 

Elara grimaced. Another tempest had ripped through the coastal city, tearing at the makeshift walls that barely kept the encroaching wilderness at bay. This wouldn't be a good night for patrols. But her orders were clear: maintain vigilance, even in the howling wind and driving rain. The whispers of raiders always rose with the storm.  

She tightened the grip on her halberd, its worn head glinting faintly in the fading light. The weight of it felt reassuring, familiar. 


Havenport was a city clinging to survival, built upon the shattered remnants of an ancient civilization. Its inhabitants, refugees from the fallen empire and those seeking sanctuary from the dangers beyond, lived in a precarious balance between hope and fear. Elara, born and raised within Havenport's walls, knew this fear intimately.
