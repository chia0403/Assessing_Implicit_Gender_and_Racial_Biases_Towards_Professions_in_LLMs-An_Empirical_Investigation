The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Silas Blackwood's office like a thousand tiny fists. Each drop echoed in the cavernous space, bouncing off dusty file cabinets and cobwebbed lamps. A single bare bulb cast long, distorted shadows that danced with the flickering light of a dying fireplace. 

Silas Blackwood himself, his face etched with lines as deep as the canyons carved into the Arizona desert outside, sat hunched over his desk. A half-smoked cigarette smoldered in an overflowing ashtray beside him, casting a sickly yellow glow on the photograph pinned to the corkboard behind his chair. It depicted a woman with fiery red hair and eyes that held both laughter and sorrow.  He traced the outline of her face with his finger, a familiar ache settling in his chest. 

The phone rang, its shrill cry slicing through the storm's roar. Silas reached for it, his calloused hand gripping the receiver with a practiced ease. "Blackwood Investigations," he rasped into the mouthpiece, his voice thick with the gravel of years spent battling both the law and the elements. "Leave your message."


The setting: A dilapidated office building on the outskirts of Phoenix, Arizona. The year is 1954, and the city teems with shadows â€“ a haven for those seeking solace or anonymity, and a breeding ground for secrets whispered in darkened alleys.
