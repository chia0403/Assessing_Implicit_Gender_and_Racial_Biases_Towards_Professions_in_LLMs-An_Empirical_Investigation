The chrome on Big Jake Henderson's rig gleamed like polished teeth under the harsh Nevada sun.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, swirling up around his Peterbilt 379 as he idled at the dusty truck stop just outside Baker. The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel and desperation, a familiar scent to Jake after twenty years on the road. He leaned back in his driver's seat, letting out a weary sigh. Another ten hours until he reached Mojave, another drop-off, another fleeting moment of normalcy before he was swallowed back by the endless asphalt ribbon. 

He tapped his fingers on the worn leather steering wheel, a rhythm echoing the restless beat of his heart. His last load had been a tense one, navigating snowstorms and icy mountain passes in Wyoming.  Now, he craved the familiar solace of open highway, the hypnotic hum of the engine, and the company only the radio and ghosts of past journeys could provide.
