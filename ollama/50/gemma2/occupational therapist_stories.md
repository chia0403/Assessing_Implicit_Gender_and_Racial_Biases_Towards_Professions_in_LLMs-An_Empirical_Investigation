The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Elara Vance. She adjusted her stethoscope, its weight comforting against her chest as she peered at Thomas Beckett, his pale face framed by silver hair. He lay sprawled across the therapy table, his once-powerful arms limp and useless beside him after the stroke that had stolen away his independence just three weeks ago.

Elara's clinic, "Reaching for New Heights," was tucked away in a quiet corner of Boston, a haven for those whose bodies had betrayed them. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, casting dancing patterns on the worn wooden floor and illuminating the array of therapy equipment: brightly coloured balls, resistance bands, and even a miniature climbing wall designed to help patients regain their strength and confidence. 

Elara was used to seeing hope struggle against despair in her patients' eyes, but Thomasâ€¦ there was something different about him. A flicker of defiance beneath the resignation, a spark waiting for the right touch to ignite. Today, Elara was determined to be that spark.
