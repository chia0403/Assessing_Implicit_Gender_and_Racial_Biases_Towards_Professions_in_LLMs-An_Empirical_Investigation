The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Blythe's head, casting a sterile glow over the cramped waiting room. It was 7:30 AM, the hour when fear seeped into the air like humidity before a thunderstorm. Amy knew this well; she was a phlebotomist at Riverview Clinic, and her days were spent navigating the anxieties of strangers as they sat with needles poised on their minds. Today, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced beneath her skin, amplified by the unnerving silence that had descended upon the waiting room. Usually, it buzzed with the anxious murmurs of patients and the rustling of magazines. Now, only the hum of the lights and the rhythmic drip of an IV bag broke the stillness. Amy looked around, her gaze lingering on the empty chairs, a knot tightening in her stomach.  

The air hung thick with anticipation â€“ not for the arrival of another patient, but for something else entirely. Something that felt both exhilarating and terrifying.
