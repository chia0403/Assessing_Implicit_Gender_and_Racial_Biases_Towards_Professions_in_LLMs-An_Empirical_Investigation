The scent of eucalyptus oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee. Sunlight streamed through the windows of "Spine & Soul," casting long shadows across Dr. Amelia Harding's well-worn treatment table. Outside, the bustling streets of downtown Asheville hummed with life, but within her small clinic, a sense of calm prevailed. 

Amelia adjusted the lumbar pillow on the table, smoothing out a wrinkle in the crisp white sheet beneath it. She glanced at the clock – 9:00 AM sharp. Mrs. Henderson was due any minute, and Amelia knew she’d be arriving with that familiar worried furrow between her brows. Her chronic back pain had become a constant companion, casting a shadow over her otherwise vibrant life.

Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the task ahead. She loved being a chiropractor – helping people find relief from their aches and pains, restoring their mobility, and witnessing them rediscover joy in everyday movement. But sometimes, the weight of their burdens felt heavy on her own shoulders. 


The chime above the door jingled, announcing Mrs. Henderson's arrival. Amelia turned, a warm smile blooming on her face. "Good morning, Mrs. H! Ready for some spine magic?"
