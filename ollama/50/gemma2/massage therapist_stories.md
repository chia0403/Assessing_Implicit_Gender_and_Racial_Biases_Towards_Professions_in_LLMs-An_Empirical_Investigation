The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, swirling around Eleanor Anya Petrova like a comforting embrace.  She kneaded her palms together, warming them before reaching for another client's tense shoulders. The dim lights of her "Serene Touch" massage studio flickered softly, casting long shadows across the room. Outside, the city throbbed with its usual frenetic energy, but within these walls, Eleanor created an oasis of tranquility. Tonight, though, a different kind of tension vibrated in the air â€“ one that had nothing to do with knotted muscles or stressed minds.

Now, as she pressed her fingers into the tight bands of muscle along his back, a shiver ran down her spine.  There was something unsettling about him, something that whispered of secrets hidden beneath the surface, and Eleanor felt an unwelcome prickle of unease.
