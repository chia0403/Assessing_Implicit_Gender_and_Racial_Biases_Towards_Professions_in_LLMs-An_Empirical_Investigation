The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Jenkins' neck like a blacksmith’s hammer, turning his sweat-soaked collar into a damp cage.  A plume of dust rose from the asphalt he was patching, a miniature sandstorm in the vast expanse of the Arizona desert. The highway stretched out before him like a silver ribbon snaking through ochre and burnt umber landscapes, an artery pumping traffic between dusty towns and forgotten ghost stops.

Bart squinted at the horizon, his calloused hand shielding his eyes from the glare. A mirage shimmered on the horizon, tantalizingly promising a haven of cool green shade that dissolved into shimmering nothingness as he blinked. It was always like this out here, a constant battle against the unforgiving heat and the illusion of relief. He wiped his brow with a grimy bandana, leaving behind a trail of dust. This stretch of I-40 had seen better days, he thought, patching another crack in the asphalt – a metaphor for the weary landscape surrounding him.

He was alone, as usual. Most highway workers preferred their own company, finding solace in the rhythm of their work and the endless expanse of sky above. But Bart felt something deeper than just solitude; he felt the weight of stories untold, secrets whispered by the wind that swept across the desert, carrying echoes of journeys past and futures yet to come.  He imagined the lives passing him by on I-40 – truckers hauling dreams, families escaping troubles, tourists chasing adventures. Each car a microcosm of human experience, leaving its own fleeting mark on this sun-baked ribbon of asphalt.
