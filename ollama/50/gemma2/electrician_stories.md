The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt copper as Elias Thornwood tightened the last wire on the panel. He wiped his brow with a calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. The flickering fluorescent lights in the dilapidated diner cast long shadows across the grimy Formica counter and faded booths. Elias squinted at the wiring diagram taped to the wall, its edges curling from years of grease and spilled coffee. 

This wasn't exactly the glamorous gig he'd envisioned when he first apprenticed under his father, but it was honest work, and sometimes, honest work in a sleepy town like Maple Creek was all you could hope for. Besides, there was something strangely satisfying about coaxing life back into these ancient electrical systems, resurrecting forgotten power with a flick of his wrist. 

Elias straightened, surveyed his handiwork, and plugged the final cable into the wall socket. The diner's lights hummed to life, bathing the room in a warm, steady glow. He smiled, feeling a familiar surge of pride. Another job well done. But as he turned to leave, a shiver ran down his spine, an unsettling prickle that told him something wasn't quite right. 


**Setting:** A rundown diner in Maple Creek, a small, isolated town nestled in the heart of rural America.
