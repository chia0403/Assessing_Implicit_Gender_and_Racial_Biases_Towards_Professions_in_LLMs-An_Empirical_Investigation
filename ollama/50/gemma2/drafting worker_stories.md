The air in the drafting room hung thick with the scent of burnt graphite and stale coffee.  Elias Finchley hunched over his drawing board, the scratchy whisper of his pencil against tracing paper the only sound that dared to pierce the silence. Outside, the steel giants of Port Cityâ€™s shipyard groaned and clanged, a symphony of industry barely audible through the thick glass windows.

Elias, with his perpetually smudged glasses and hair permanently in disarray from years of battling tangled blueprints, was a master craftsman of lines and angles. He could conjure impossible structures from mere scribbles on paper, breathing life into dreams built of steel and rivets. Today, however, inspiration felt as distant as the sun through the perpetual haze that shrouded the city. His current project, the design for a new cargo freighter, had him wrestling with stubborn calculations and unyielding deadlines. 


The rhythmic tick-tock of the clock on the wall mocked his struggle, each tick another minute slipping away from the ever-tightening deadline.  He chewed nervously on the end of his pencil, willing his mind to focus, desperate to break through the fog of frustration that threatened to engulf him entirely. Then, a sudden burst of clatter from the hallway startled him, followed by the familiar voice of Mr. O'Malley, the gruff foreman, barking orders at some unfortunate soul.  Elias sighed, pushing his glasses further up his nose, and braced himself for whatever new challenge Port City had in store for him today.
