Rain lashed against the cracked windowpane of Bartholomew "Barty" Higgins's beat-up Ford Transit van. The wipers battled valiantly but struggled to keep up with the torrent that blurred the world outside into an impressionistic painting of greys and greens. Barty hunched over his toolbox, the dim interior light illuminating grease stains on his overalls and a half-eaten tuna sandwich perched precariously on the edge of the toolbox. He tapped his fingers impatiently against the steering wheel, waiting for the storm to pass. 

He was stuck in Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch - yes, that one - a village nestled deep in the Welsh countryside, known more for its ridiculously long name than any plumbing emergencies.  Barty had been called out to fix Mrs. Jenkins's overflowing toilet bowl, which was an ironic problem considering the woman lived by a river and apparently considered bathing a frivolous pursuit. But the job had come through right as the heavens opened, trapping him in this picturesque purgatory of rain and sheep.


He glanced at his phone; no signal.  Typical. At least the storm would wash away any evidence of the questionable curry he'd devoured for lunch last night. He sighed, resigning himself to a long wait. It was moments like these that Barty questioned his life choices. But then again, who else would fix toilets in a village where the name alone could give you writer's cramp?
