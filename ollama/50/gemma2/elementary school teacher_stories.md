The scent of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of disinfectant from Mrs. Amelia Beatrice Finchley's desk cleaner.  Her classroom, a kaleidoscope of primary colours and mismatched furniture, buzzed with the pre-school energy of twenty five seven-year-olds. Sunbeams sliced through the dusty windows, illuminating a jungle mural on one wall, its faded green canvas home to a motley crew of papier-mâché animals.  

Amelia surveyed her domain with a weary smile. Another day at Meadowbrook Elementary, another battlefield where imagination clashed with crayons and goldfish crackers were considered essential currency. She adjusted her spectacles, their round lenses catching the dancing motes of dust in the morning light. Today was going to be interesting, she could feel it in her bones.  A sense of foreboding, as tangible as the lingering scent of burnt toast, settled over her heart.
