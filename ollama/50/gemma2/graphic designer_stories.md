The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and printer toner. Elena "Ellie" Ramirez squinted at her computer screen, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tweaked the typography on the flyer for the local bakery's grand opening.  

Her tiny studio apartment, nestled above a bustling ramen shop in Brooklyn's Chinatown, was bathed in the warm glow of sunset. Outside, the cacophony of car horns and street vendors mingled with the rhythmic clatter of chopsticks against bowls below. Ellie tapped her pen against her teeth, contemplating the placement of the logo - a whimsical pastry chef wearing a baker's hat – when a sharp ringing cut through the air. It was her phone, vibrating insistently on the worn-out velvet cushion she used as a makeshift desk mat.

Taking a deep breath to quell the mounting frustration, Ellie reached for the device and answered with a tired, "Hello?"  


The voice on the other end was crisp and professional, a stark contrast to the chaotic energy swirling around her studio. 
"Ms. Ramirez? This is Mr. Lee from Visionary Media. I'm calling about your portfolio."

Ellie’s heart skipped a beat. Visionary Media. The prestigious agency that handled campaigns for major brands like Nike and Google. Could this be it? Her chance to finally break out of the endless cycle of flyers and local business promotions?
