Rain lashed against the frosted windows of Evelyn Beatrice Finch’s tiny office, each drop drumming a frantic rhythm on the glass. The old Victorian building groaned around her, its bones weary from years of neglect. Evelyn, perched at her chipped oak desk, barely noticed the storm raging outside. Her focus was solely on the jumble of receipts and invoices spread before her, each one a whispered accusation in the growing darkness. She squinted through the dim light filtering in from the flickering gas lamp above, trying to decipher a particularly messy scrawl. 


Evelyn Beatrice Finch, bookkeeper extraordinaire (at least that's what she told herself), was drowning in numbers. The accounts for her latest client, a struggling antique shop named "Yesterday's Treasures," were a labyrinth of contradictions and missing entries. It wasn't the first time Evelyn had encountered financial chaos; most small businesses seemed to operate on a delicate balance of hope and desperation. But this felt different. There was something…off about these records. A feeling that whispered of hidden truths, like a secret language she couldn't quite decipher.


Evelyn pushed back her chair, stretching stiff limbs. She needed fresh air, even if it meant braving the storm outside.  As she pulled on her coat, she noticed a peculiar detail – a single crimson feather nestled amongst the scattered paperwork. It was out of place, impossibly vibrant against the muted tones of the office. Evelyn picked it up, turning it over in her gloved hand. A shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't just a messy set of books anymore. 


This was something else entirely.
