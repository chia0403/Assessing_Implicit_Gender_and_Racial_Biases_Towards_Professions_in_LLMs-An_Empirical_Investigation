The air hung thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth, the only sounds a chorus of cicadas buzzing in the sun-dappled forest and the rhythmic thud of Elias Blackwoodâ€™s chainsaw.  He leaned into the roar of the engine, guiding it with practiced ease through the giant Douglas fir. Sweat beaded on his brow, but he didn't mind. He was home here, in these emerald depths, miles from the dusty town that held little appeal for him. 

Elias Blackwood, a name as sturdy and enduring as the trees he felled, had been working this patch of land since he was fifteen. Now, at thirty-two, his calloused hands knew every twist and turn of the timber like an old friend.  He wasn't just a logger; he was a sculptor of nature, shaping the forest with each precise cut. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he finished felling the behemoth, its colossal shadow stretching across the clearing like a fallen giant. 


The setting: The story takes place in a vast and ancient temperate rainforest on the Pacific Northwest coast of North America. Towering Douglas firs dominate the landscape, their branches interwoven to create a verdant canopy that filters sunlight into dappled patterns on the forest floor. Moss-covered logs lie scattered throughout the undergrowth, testament to the cyclical nature of life and decay. The air is humid and alive with the scent of pine needles and damp earth.
