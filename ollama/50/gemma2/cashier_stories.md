The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. Their buzz was the soundtrack to her existence, as predictable and grating as the endless stream of customers shuffling through the aisles of "Groceries Galore." It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills, kept the electricity running in her tiny apartment, and gave her enough left over to indulge in the occasional bottle of overpriced red wine. 

Amelia swiped a barcode, her fingers moving with practiced efficiency across the scanner. A faded picture of a smiling sunflower adorned the machine, a testament to its age and perhaps a metaphor for Amelia's own life â€“ bright and hopeful on the surface, but slowly wilting under the relentless pressure of routine. 


**Setting:**

Groceries Galore is a mid-sized supermarket nestled in a quiet suburban neighborhood. The aisles are cramped and cluttered, with outdated signage hanging precariously from rusted wires. There's a faint scent of stale coffee and cleaning products in the air, punctuated by the occasional whiff of rotten produce.
