The acrid bite of smoke stung Elias Thorneâ€™s nostrils even before he crested the ridge.  He squinted, his helmet reflecting the orange glow emanating from the valley below. The flames danced voraciously, consuming the dry underbrush with an insatiable hunger. A plume of black smoke, thick as a serpent, snaked its way skyward, staining the twilight canvas a sinister gray. This wasn't just any wildfire; this was Diablo Canyon, a notorious inferno known for its unpredictable nature and unforgiving terrain. 

Elias, Engine Captain Elias Thorne of Station 17, gripped his helmet tighter, the familiar weight grounding him amidst the chaos. He could hear the distant roar of the flames and the crackle of burning timber. His team, seasoned veterans all, were already preparing to deploy. Elias took a deep breath, tasting smoke and fear in equal measure.  It was going to be a long night. 


**Setting:** Diablo Canyon, California - A rugged and desolate valley known for its steep cliffs, dense forests, and dry brush. The air is thick with smoke and the ground crackles with heat. Late afternoon bleeds into twilight, casting long shadows across the ravaged landscape.
