The incessant click-clack of Evelyn Beatrice Finch's typewriter was the only sound breaking the heavy silence of her cramped London flat. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the city lights into a watercolour wash of orange and yellow.  Evelyn ran a hand through her tangled auburn hair, frustration etched on her usually bright face. Her latest story, a gothic thriller set in a crumbling manor house, was stuck. The climax, where the detective unmasked the villain, felt flat, predictable.

She stared at the manuscript pages strewn across her desk like fallen leaves – each one promising a thrilling twist that never quite materialized. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempest brewing within Evelyn's mind. 


The year was 1938. The world outside was teetering on the brink of war, but in Evelyn’s little universe, the greatest battle was being waged against writer's block.
