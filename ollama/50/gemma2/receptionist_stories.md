The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Brighton, their pale light casting an almost sickly glow on the worn carpet of the reception area. It was 7:58 AM, and the clock ticked impatiently towards eight o'clock – the moment when the phone would inevitably explode with calls from clients demanding urgent appointments and disgruntled patients questioning billing statements.  

Amelia, perched behind the chipped oak desk, idly traced patterns in the dusty surface with her finger. The office smelled faintly of stale coffee and disinfectant, a familiar scent she'd grown accustomed to over the past five years at Dr. Evans’ bustling dermatology clinic. Outside, the city was beginning to stir, a low rumble of traffic slowly rising to its morning crescendo. But inside, Amelia found herself caught in a quiet stillness, a moment of peace before the storm. 


Her gaze drifted towards the framed photographs on the wall: smiling couples celebrating successful surgeries, children beaming after treatments for birthmarks, even a few celebrities (though their names were discreetly scratched out). They were reminders of the clinic's purpose - to heal and improve lives. And though Amelia was just a receptionist, she felt a small sense of pride knowing she played a part in that.
