The rhythmic click-clack of Eleanor Beatrice Finch's typewriter was the only sound in her cluttered attic studio. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the staccato beat of her thoughts as she wrestled with the opening paragraph of her new novel. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the eaves of the Victorian house and rattling the old bones of the building. Inside, Eleanor hunched over her desk, bathed in the warm glow of a kerosene lamp, its flickering light casting long shadows that danced across the walls lined with overflowing bookshelves. Her manuscript was due next month, but the story refused to take shape. The characters remained flat, the plot a tangled mess. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her bun.  This wasn't how it usually went. She prided herself on being able to weave captivating tales with ease, but this time, inspiration seemed to have abandoned her altogether. Maybe she just needed a change of scenery. Or perhaps, a little bit of magic.
