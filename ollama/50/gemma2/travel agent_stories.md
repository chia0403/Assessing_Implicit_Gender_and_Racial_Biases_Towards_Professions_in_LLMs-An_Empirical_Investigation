The scent of stale coffee and jasmine incense hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer that Amelia "Amy" Rose Butterfield liberally applied to her trembling hands every five minutes.  

Her tiny travel agency, "Wanderlust & Wishes," nestled on a quiet side street in Asheville, North Carolina, was anything but bustling. Tourists flocked to the Blue Ridge Parkway and its breathtaking vistas, but Amy's quaint shop, with its mismatched armchairs and overflowing bookshelves of well-worn travel guides, seemed perpetually stuck in a quiet lull. 

Today, however, was different. A woman with fiery red hair and eyes that sparkled like amethysts stood stiffly by the counter, clutching a worn leather suitcase. She emanated an air of urgency, her every movement tinged with a barely contained desperation.  Amy could sense it before the woman spoke - this trip wasn't just a vacation; it was a lifeline.
