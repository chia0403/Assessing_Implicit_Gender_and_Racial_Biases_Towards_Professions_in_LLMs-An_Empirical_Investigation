The humid Georgia air clung to Clara Belle Remington like a damp shroud. The cicadas thrummed their incessant song in the overgrown magnolia trees that cast long, skeletal shadows across her porch.  Clara Belle sat hunched over her easel, palette knife scraping at a canvas awash with crimson and gold. She was trying, desperately, to capture the fiery sunset bleeding into the thick, velvety twilight, but every stroke felt clumsy, lifeless. 

Her studio, a converted chicken coop behind her grandmother's rambling farmhouse, was cluttered with canvases, tubes of paint squeezed dry, and brushes resting in dusty jars. A single bare bulb cast a sickly yellow light over the scene, highlighting the peeling paint on the walls and the cobwebs that hung like ghostly curtains in the corners. Outside, the twilight deepened, swallowing the last vestiges of sunlight, leaving Clara Belle alone with her frustration and the growing silence of dusk.
