The sun beat down on Theodore "Teddy" Callahan's neck like a blacksmith’s hammer, turning his already sweaty skin into something resembling tanned leather. He wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. Below him, the terracotta rooftops of Old Town sprawled like faded tiles in a mosaic. A hawk circled lazily overhead, its shadow a fleeting dance across the slate shingles he was meticulously repairing. 

Teddy took a deep breath, savoring the familiar scent of hot tar and dust mingled with the faint aroma of blooming honeysuckle from Mrs. Rodriguez’s garden below.  He loved this job - being up here, amidst the clatter of tools and the dizzying view, feeling like the world was spread out beneath him like a wrinkled map. But today, the usual tranquility was disrupted by a nagging unease. A knot of worry tightened in his gut, as persistent as the relentless Arizona sun. He couldn’t shake the feeling that something was different, that something bigger than a leaking roof was about to change everything.


The year was 1978. Tucson was a city on the cusp of transformation, its dusty streets humming with a sense of restless anticipation. Teddy, a third-generation roofer, had always felt safe within its familiar rhythms. But today, a new kind of heat radiated from the very air itself, a feeling that whispered of change, both exciting and unsettling.
