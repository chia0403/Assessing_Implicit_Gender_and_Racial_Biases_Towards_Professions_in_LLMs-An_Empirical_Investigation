Dr. Amelia Celeste Hayes adjusted her glasses, peering over them at the anxious face opposite her. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Hayes’s office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Rain pattered softly against the windowpanes, a melancholy counterpoint to the nervous tapping of Mr. Daniels' fingers against his knee. 

Dr. Hayes’s office wasn't particularly inviting. The beige walls were adorned with generic prints of landscapes that lacked any vibrancy or character. A worn-out rug covered the floor, doing little to dampen the sound of each footstep. It was a space designed for neutrality, a blank canvas on which to project the anxieties and hopes of her patients.  But today, Dr. Hayes felt the weight of the silence pressing down on them both. Mr. Daniels’s eyes were red-rimmed, his usual jovial demeanor replaced with a deep furrow in his brow. 

“Mr. Daniels,” Dr. Hayes began softly, “You wanted to talk about... your dreams.”


The rain intensified outside, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist painting of grays and blues. A perfect metaphor, thought Dr. Hayes, for the turmoil brewing within Mr. Daniels.
