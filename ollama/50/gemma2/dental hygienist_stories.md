The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Rose Thorne's head, their sterile glow casting long, skeletal shadows across the beige linoleum floor.  Her reflection in the stainless steel mirror stared back, tired eyes peering from beneath her auburn braid. The familiar scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a comforting constant amidst the daily symphony of drills and suction noises that filled Thorne Dental. Elara sighed, adjusting her blue scrub top and hoping to banish the lingering weariness from yesterday's double shift. She was just about ready for Mrs. Henderson's appointment – anything but another visit with Mr. Patterson, whose teeth seemed to be a constant source of anxiety for both him and Elara. 


Elara had been working as a dental hygienist for five years,  and while the routine often felt predictable, there was always an element of human connection that kept her coming back. Today, however, that connection felt strained. It was like everyone in the office – from Dr. Thorne himself to the receptionist, Brenda – seemed to be walking on eggshells, avoiding eye contact and muttering hushed conversations behind cupped hands.  


Something was amiss, Elara could feel it in her bones, a premonition she couldn't quite shake off.
