The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the red vinyl booths and chipped Formica tables of "Joe's Place."  A wave of greasy diner air, thick with coffee and frying onions, washed over her as she straightened a stack of menus that had been haphazardly shoved into their rack. 

Amelia squinted at the clock above the counter: 7:03 PM. It was Friday night, and Joe's Place was already buzzing with its usual crowd - truck drivers on layover, families celebrating birthdays, couples nursing stale coffee dates. 

She smoothed down her faded denim apron, the one emblazoned with "Joe's Best Server" in a font that looked like it belonged on a dusty 1950s postcard, and took a deep breath.  The clatter of dishes, the sizzle of the grill, the cacophony of voices â€“ it was a symphony of the mundane, but it was her symphony. This greasy spoon diner, with its chipped paint and mismatched furniture, was Amelia's stage.
