The morning mist clung to Elias Blackwood's beard like spun silver as he surveyed his fields. Dawn was just beginning to blush over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of rose and lavender. The dew-laden air vibrated with the chirping of crickets, their song a familiar lullaby to Elias after countless years spent tending the land. His farm, Blackwood Acres, nestled deep in the heart of Appalachia, was a tapestry woven from generations of hard work and love.  

The air carried the scent of damp earth and ripening tomatoes, a comforting aroma that promised another bountiful harvest. But beneath this familiar tranquility, a shadow lurked. Elias could feel it in his bones, a prickling unease that had settled upon Blackwood Acres like a shroud. The whispers began last month, tales of strange lights flickering in the woods and eerie howls echoing through the valleys.  


Elias, a man who found solace in the rhythm of the seasons and the solidity of the earth beneath his boots, dismissed them as mere superstition. But lately, even he couldn't ignore the growing sense that something was amiss.
