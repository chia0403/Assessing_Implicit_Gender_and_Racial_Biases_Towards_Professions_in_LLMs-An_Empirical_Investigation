The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne had come to cherish. Sunlight slanted through the arched windows of the Oakhaven Library, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. Amelia, perched on a ladder halfway up the towering shelves, ran her fingers along the spines of ancient volumes, their titles whispering secrets from bygone eras. She paused at a particularly worn copy of "The Necronomicon," its cover cracked and faded. A shiver, not entirely unpleasant, tickled her spine.

Oakhaven was more than just a repository of books; it was a living entity, steeped in history and whispered tales of magic. Nestled amongst the rolling hills of rural Vermont, the library had stood for centuries, its sturdy stone walls bearing witness to generations of seekers and dreamers. But lately, Amelia had sensed a shift in the air, an undercurrent of unease that mingled with the familiar scent of parchment and ink. 


The peaceful haven she knew was beginning to feel... different.
