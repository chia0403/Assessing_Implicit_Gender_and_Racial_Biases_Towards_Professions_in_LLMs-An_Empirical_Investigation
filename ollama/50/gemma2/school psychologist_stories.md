The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn linoleum floor of Mrs. Eleanor Beaumont’s office. Outside, rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Ellie's own mind.  She rubbed her temples, fighting off the throbbing headache that always seemed to accompany these meetings. Today's case was particularly thorny: 14-year-old Leo Anderson, a quiet boy with eyes too old for his age, accused of stealing another student’s prized comic book collection and exhibiting unsettlingly erratic behavior in class.  

Ellie took a deep breath, trying to center herself. This wasn't the first time she'd dealt with troubled teenagers, but something about Leo, his haunted gaze and cryptic responses during her initial assessment, gnawed at her. She wished she had more information, something tangible beyond whispered rumors and anecdotal evidence from teachers.  

The school was a hulking brick structure on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a town steeped in secrets and whispers. Built decades ago during a period of rapid population growth, it felt perpetually overcrowded, its hallways echoing with the anxieties and ambitions of hundreds of students. It wasn't the kind of place where problems simply disappeared. They festered, like a cold settling in your bones, waiting for the right moment to explode. 


And Ellie, as the school psychologist, was often tasked with trying to keep those explosions from happening.
