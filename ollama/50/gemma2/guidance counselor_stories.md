The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Ms. Amelia Croft's cluttered office. Paperclips clinked against her desk, a constant soundtrack to the anxieties swirling around her small space at Westview High. Outside, the spring air buzzed with freedom and possibility, but within these four walls, the scent of teenage angst hung heavy.  

Amelia pushed aside a stack of college brochures, their glossy pages promising futures she knew were just as blurry for her students as they were for herself. Her phone buzzed, a reminder about the upcoming SAT prep session she'd be leading later that afternoon. She sighed, already feeling the familiar ache in her shoulders – a result of years spent shouldering the weight of others' dreams. 

But today was different. Today, Amelia had a student waiting for her who wasn’t there to discuss college applications or standardized test scores. He needed something more, something she wasn't entirely sure she could offer. His name was Liam, and he looked lost in the sea of teenage chaos that surrounded him.


The setting is Ms. Amelia Croft's guidance counselor office at Westview High, a bustling high school on the cusp of summer break.
