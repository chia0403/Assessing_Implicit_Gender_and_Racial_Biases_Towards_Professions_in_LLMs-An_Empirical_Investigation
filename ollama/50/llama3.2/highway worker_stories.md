Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was just starting to set over the vast expanse of Interstate 40, casting a golden glow over the asphalt stretch that stretched out before Highway Maintenance Worker Harrison Everett Thompson like an endless ribbon. It was a sight he'd grown all too familiar with over the years, one that never failed to stir up a mix of feelings in his chest - a sense of pride in the work he did, and a quiet melancholy at the thought of another day spent on the road.

As Harrison climbed out of the cab of his trusty Peterbilt 359, the worn leather seat creaking beneath him like an old friend, he took one last look out over the horizon. The sky was ablaze with color - hues of pink and orange that deepened to a rich purple as the sun dipped lower in the sky.

It was going to be a long night ahead, and Harrison knew it already. He had a crew meeting at 9 PM to discuss the upcoming road closure on I-40 for the upcoming construction season, and he still needed to finish inspecting the drainage system at mile marker 143 before he could call it a day.

As he made his way down from the cab, the crunch of gravel beneath his boots echoed through the silence, a stark reminder that this was just another day on the job - one that would likely end with him returning home late to his wife, Emily, and their two kids, Jack and Lily. But for now, Harrison had no choice but to focus on the task at hand.

With a deep breath, he shouldered his lunch pail, tucked it under his arm, and set off into the fading light of day.
