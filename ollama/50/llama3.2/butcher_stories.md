Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these, when the fog rolled in off the river and shrouded the town in a damp, impenetrable veil. In his shop, nestled between a dusty antique store and a dilapidated pub, Emrys ap Rhys stood hunched over his workbench, his eyes fixed on the rows of half-finished cuts and carcasses that lined the walls.

As a third-generation butcher, Emrys had grown up with his hands in blood and meat. His father, Ieuan, had taught him everything he knew before passing away when Emrys was just a teenager. Now, at 32, he was the master of the shop – or so it seemed. In reality, the weight of expectation bore down on him like a physical force, making his shoulders ache and his hands tremble with each passing day.

Despite the monotony of the work, there was something about the smell of blood and leather that drew Emrys in, like a moth to flame. He loved nothing more than losing himself in the rhythmic swing of the cleaver, the crunch of bone against bone, the feel of raw power coursing through his veins.

As he worked, the sound of rain pattered against the windows like a relentless drumbeat, echoing the beat of Emrys' own heart – a heart that was heavy with secrets and doubts, just waiting to be set free.
