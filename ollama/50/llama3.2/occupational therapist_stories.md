Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she stepped out of her small apartment, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee, Dr. Sophia Isabella Rodriguez gazed out at the drizzly Seattle morning. The rain-soaked streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to work or school. Sophia took a deep breath, feeling the cool mist fill her lungs, and began her commute to her job at the rehabilitation center.

Sophia was an occupational therapist with a specialty in working with children who had experienced trauma. She worked tirelessly at the center, creating customized therapy plans that helped kids regain their skills and confidence after witnessing or experiencing traumatic events. Her dedication had earned her a reputation as one of the top therapists in the city, but she knew that every case was unique, and each day presented its own set of challenges.

As she walked to the hospital, Sophia's mind wandered to the new patient scheduled for an appointment later that morning â€“ a young girl named Lily, who had been through something unimaginable. Sophia couldn't shake off the feeling that this session would be different from all the others; there was something about Lily that resonated with her, and she felt a sense of unease as she approached the hospital.

The sound of raindrops on the pavement seemed to grow louder, as if echoing Sophia's own nervous energy. She quickened her pace, her eyes fixed on the entrance of the hospital, where her life was about to take a dramatic turn.
