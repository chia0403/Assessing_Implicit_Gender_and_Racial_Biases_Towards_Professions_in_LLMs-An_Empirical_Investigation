Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small town of Ashwood, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy streets and weathered buildings. In the heart of the town, where the cobblestone roads gave way to worn dirt paths, stood the modest workshop of Emrys Wystan Fletcher - Stonecutter.

Emrys, a man in his late 40s with a rugged face and hands that had spent decades honing their craft, emerged from the misty dawn, stretching his arms as he took a deep breath of the damp morning air. The smell of wet stone and freshly cut wood wafted through the air, mingling with the faint scent of yesterday's ale from the local tavern.

As Emrys made his way to the workshop, the sound of the town stirring around him - the clanging of pots, the chatter of the market square, the distant rumble of the river as it flowed through the valley below - began to fill his senses. It was a peaceful life, one that he had grown to love and cherish over the years.

But Emrys couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to disrupt this tranquility. A sense of unease lingered at the back of his mind, like the faint tremor of an earthquake on the horizon. And as he pushed open the creaky door to his workshop, a small, unassuming package waited for him on the workbench - its wooden box adorned with intricate carvings and sealed with a wax seal bearing the mark of the town's ancient guild.

This marked the beginning of Emrys' journey into a world where mysterious forces would challenge his skills as a stonecutter, test his resolve, and lead him to unravel secrets that had lain hidden for centuries beneath the town of Ashwood.
