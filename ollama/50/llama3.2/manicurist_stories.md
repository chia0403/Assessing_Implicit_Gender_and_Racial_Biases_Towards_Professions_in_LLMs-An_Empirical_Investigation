In a small, dimly lit nail salon tucked away on San Pedro Street, 25-year-old Akane Katsuragi carefully buffed a customer's nails to a high shine. The soft hum of jazz music and the gentle chatter of the other patrons created a soothing atmosphere that seemed to melt away the stresses of everyday life.
