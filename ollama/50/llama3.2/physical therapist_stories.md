Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small coastal town of Tidal Cove, where Dr. Alexandra "Alex" Thompson stood gazing out at the gray waters of the ocean as she locked up her office for the day. As a physical therapist specializing in aquatic rehabilitation, Alex had spent countless hours helping patients recover from injuries and illnesses that left them feeling stranded on the shore.

The sound of seagulls calling overhead was a familiar lullaby to Alex, who had grown up in Tidal Cove and knew its rhythms as well as she knew her own pulse. She took a deep breath, inhaling the salty scent of the sea and exhaling the tension that always seemed to build up inside her after a long day of helping others.

As she walked towards her small beachside bungalow, Alex's mind turned to the patient she had just seen in session – a young surfer named Jake who had been struggling to regain mobility in his knee after a devastating wipeout. She couldn't help but feel a pang of concern for him, wondering if she was doing everything she could to help him catch the wave again.

The bungalow's porch creaked beneath Alex's feet as she stepped up onto it, and she gazed out at the darkness gathering over the ocean. It was moments like these that made her grateful for this life of hers – one that allowed her to be surrounded by the beauty and power of the sea, while also making a difference in the lives of those who needed it most.
