Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a chilly winter evening in January 1888, and the snowflakes gently fell onto the cobblestone streets of London's East End. Amidst the bustling markets and narrow alleys, a small tailor's shop on Brick Lane stood like a beacon, its windows aglow with warm candlelight.

Inside, Emilia Isabella Wellesley sat hunched over her workbench, surrounded by spools of thread, rolls of fabric, and the soft hum of sewing machines. As the daughter of a respected tailoring family, Emilia had learned the art of bespoke garment-making from her father, who had passed away when she was just a teenager. Now, at 25 years old, Emilia was determined to make a name for herself in the competitive world of high-end fashion.

The sound of a knock at the door broke the silence, and Emilia's eyes lit up with excitement as she set aside her work-in-progress. She rose from her stool and made her way to the entrance, smoothing out the wrinkles on her apron before opening the door to reveal a tall, handsome stranger who stood on her threshold, his piercing blue eyes fixed intently on hers.

"Good evening, miss," he said, his deep voice sending shivers down Emilia's spine. "I've come for my bespoke suit. I'm told you're the best tailor in London."
