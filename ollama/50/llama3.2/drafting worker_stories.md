The sun had just begun to set over the sprawling metropolis of New Haven, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling streets of the industrial district.

Ethan's eyes scanned the blueprint in front of him, his brow furrowed in concentration as he tried to make sense of the complex network of pipes and ducts that crisscrossed the layout. As a skilled draftsman, he was responsible for creating detailed blueprints for Harrington Industries' latest project - a massive new factory complex that would rival any other in the city.
