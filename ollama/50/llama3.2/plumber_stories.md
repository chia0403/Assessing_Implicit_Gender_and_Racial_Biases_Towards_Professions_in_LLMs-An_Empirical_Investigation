Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood City gleamed like polished stone as Jack "Mac" McClaren, a ruggedly handsome plumber with a passion for fixing more than just pipes, made his way to the old Victorian house on Elm Street. The once-grand mansion loomed before him, its ornate facades and turrets shrouded in a tangled veil of ivy and mystery. A chill ran down Mac's spine as he pushed open the creaking front gate, the rusty hinges squeaking in protest.

It had been three years since Mac left Ashwood City, chasing the thrill of adventure and the promise of a steady paycheck in the bustling metropolis of Denver. But when his estranged father, a retired plumber and mentor, passed away with a cryptic will that hinted at a family legacy Mac knew nothing about, he was forced to return to the hometown he'd tried so hard to escape.

As he climbed the crumbling steps and reached out to ring the doorbell, the sound of dripping water echoed through the empty streets, accompanied by an unsettling sense of foreboding. The house seemed to be waiting for him, its secrets and stories locked away behind the peeling paint and musty scent of decay.

Mac took a deep breath, smoothing his worn denim jacket over his shoulders as he prepared to face whatever lay ahead. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take him down the rabbit hole of family history, hidden treasures, and a mystery that would threaten to destroy everything he thought he knew about himself.
