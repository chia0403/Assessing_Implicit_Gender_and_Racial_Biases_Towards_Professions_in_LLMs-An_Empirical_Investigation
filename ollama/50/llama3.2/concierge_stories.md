Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last wisps of fog lifted off the cobblestone streets of 18th arrondissement Paris, Marcelin Dupont, Conciateur to the esteemed Hôtel du Pont Royal, began his daily ritual: a sweep of the lobby, a fluff of the cushions on the velvet sofas, and a delicate sniff of the scent-infused air. The soft chime of the hotel's grandfather clock marked the precise moment when the city awakened, and Marcelin was ready to face another day of attending to the whims of his discerning clientele.

The Hôtel du Pont Royal, with its ornate facade and intricate ironwork balconies, stood as a testament to the grandeur of the French bourgeoisie. Located on a quiet street lined with high-end boutiques and patisseries, it was a haven for those who sought refuge from the bustling streets below. Marcelin's role as concierge was not just to facilitate the stay of his guests but also to weave a web of intrigue and connection that would keep them enchanted by the city.

As Marcelin expertly poured himself a cup of strong French coffee, he caught sight of the hotel's most prominent guest – the enigmatic American socialite, Olivia Blackwood – waiting for her morning appointment. Rumors swirled around Olivia like whispers in the wind, and Marcelin knew that he was about to become entangled in a mystery that would challenge everything he thought he knew about his world.
