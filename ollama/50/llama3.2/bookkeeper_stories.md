Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on days like this.

Little did Emily know, her quiet life as a bookkeeper was about to take a drastic turn, one that would propel her into a world of secrets, lies, and small-town intrigue...
