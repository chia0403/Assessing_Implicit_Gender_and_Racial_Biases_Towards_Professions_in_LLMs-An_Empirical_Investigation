As the sun set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint Main Street, Firefighter Ethan Ryder Jenkins gazed out at the tranquil scene before him. The smell of freshly cut grass wafted through the air, mingling with the faint scent of smoke and grease from the local diner, where his shift was about to end.

As he turned to head into the fire station, he was greeted by the friendly face of his colleague, Lieutenant Sarah Taylor, who raised an eyebrow and asked, "How's it going, EJ?"
