Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle gleamed like polished onyx under the faint glow of the city's streetlights. Inside the drab, beige-colored office building of Smithson & Co., accounting firm, the fluorescent lights hummed in tandem with the steady beat of the coffee machine.

Behind the worn desk, receptionist Alexandra Elizabeth Thompson adjusted her glasses and rubbed the tired creases from her forehead. It was 8:45 AM on a typical Monday morning - the kind where anything could happen, but usually didn't. The phone rang, shrill and insistent, breaking the monotony of the morning routine. Alex sighed, picking up the receiver to answer with her practiced warmth.

"Smithson & Co., Alexandra speaking. How can I help you?"
