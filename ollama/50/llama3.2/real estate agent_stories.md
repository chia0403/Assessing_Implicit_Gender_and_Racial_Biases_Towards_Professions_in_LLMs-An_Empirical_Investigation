Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the tranquil waters of Lake Tahoe, casting a warm orange glow over the snow-capped peaks of Squaw Valley, Alexandra "Alex" Thompson stood on the patio of her condominium, gazing out at the breathtaking view she had spent years selling to clients from all over the world. A top-performing real estate agent in the region, Alex was known for her encyclopedic knowledge of the local market and her ability to match her clients with their dream homes.

With a glass of chilled Pinot Grigio in hand, Alex took a deep breath, feeling the stress of the past few weeks begin to melt away. She had just closed a massive sale on a luxury property overlooking the lake, and was looking forward to celebrating with a night out on the town in South Lake Tahoe.

But as she turned to head back into her condo, Alex's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her colleague and friend, Rachel. "Hey girl, have you seen the latest listing for that infamous old mansion on the hill?" the message read. "It's a real weirdo of a property...worth checking out."

Alex raised an eyebrow as she walked back into her condo, her curiosity piqued. What was this mysterious old mansion, and why had Rachel suddenly become so interested in it? She made a mental note to look it up after she finished getting ready for the night's festivities...little did she know that this chance encounter would lead her down a path of discovery and intrigue that would change everything she thought she knew about Squaw Valley.
