Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a small patch of land on Elm Street, Jack Harrison Wellington III was kneading the dirt beneath his worn gloves as he prepared for another long night of tending to the lawn at the old Jenkins' estate.

As a licensed landscaper with 10 years of experience under his belt, Jack took pride in his work. He knew every inch of this town, every type of tree and shrub that grew here, and every trick of the trade to coax life out of even the most reluctant plants. It was a good thing, too - because on nights like these, when the mosquitoes were biting and the stars were shining bright overhead, Jack found himself drawn into the same quiet reverie that had haunted his family for generations.

Little did he know, this particular night would bring more than just the sweet scent of blooming azaleas and the distant hum of crickets. Tonight would bring a discovery that would change everything - including the course of Jack's life forever.

How's that?
