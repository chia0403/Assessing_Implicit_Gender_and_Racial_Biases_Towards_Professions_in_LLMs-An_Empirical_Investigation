Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the bustling streets of downtown Los Angeles, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded sidewalks and neon-lit storefronts. Inside the trendy salon, "Blossom Beauty," the scent of sugar wax and perfume filled the air as the staff prepared for another busy night.

Among them was 28-year-old Alexis Ruby Wilder, a talented cosmetologist with a passion for making her clients feel like royalty. With her bright pink streaks running through her dark brown hair and a sprinkle of glitter on her left cheekbone, Alexis was the go-to stylist for Hollywood stars and socialites alike.

As she expertly styled a client's bob using her signature blend of sass and expertise, Alexis's mind began to wander to the mysterious package that had arrived at the salon that morning. The unmarked box with no return address had been left on her counter, accompanied by a cryptic note that read: "Meet me at the Griffith Observatory tonight at midnight. Come alone."
