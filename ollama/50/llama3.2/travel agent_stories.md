Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the bustling streets of New York City, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan, Aurora "Rory" Thompson sat at her desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of her. She was supposed to be working on a romantic getaway for a happy couple's 10-year anniversary, but her mind kept wandering back to the cryptic message she'd received earlier that day from an old acquaintance.

The message had read: "Meet me at the usual place at midnight. Come alone."

Rory's curiosity was piqued, and she found herself wondering what kind of trouble she might get into if she showed up at a deserted location in the middle of the night. She had always been drawn to adventure, and her job as a travel agent gave her the perfect excuse to explore the world - from the sun-kissed beaches of Hawaii to the ancient ruins of Rome.

But Rory's own life was feeling a bit stale lately. She'd been working for the same company for five years, and her social calendar was starting to look like a laundry list of corporate events and client meetings. She longed for something more - excitement, danger, maybe even a little bit of romance.

As she pushed her chair back from the desk and stood up, Rory's eyes wandered out the window to the glittering lights of Times Square below. It was a night like any other in this city that never slept, but for Rory, it felt like anything could happen.
