The flickering neon sign above creaked in protest, casting long shadows that danced across the faces of weary patrons huddled around tables. Inside,  a worn copy of "The Times" lay abandoned on a sticky table next to an empty coffee cup. This was Amelia Thorne's usual haunt, a haven for truth seekers and those who dared tread where others feared to step.

Amelia, her name emblazoned across the worn leather jacket she wore like armor, tapped away furiously at her laptop, its screen illuminating the worried lines etching themselves into her face.

She took a deep breath, the scent of stale coffee and burnt toast swirling around her in a haze, and began typing.
