The air hung heavy with salt and the scent of melting ice cream in the late summer heat.  It wasn't what you'd call "sunshine", but it was certainly warm enough to make even the crispest linen jacket feel sticky against Amelia Thorne's skin.  A sigh escaped her lips as she meticulously polished a silver tray, its edges catching the last rays of the fading afternoon sun.  

Amelia Thorne had inherited the mantle of concierge at The Abernathy House - an aged Victorian mansion on the edge of the bustling city of Everleigh, a place where time seemed to move slower, and even the shadows had a tendency to linger. Amelia's grandfather, the previous owner, was known for his meticulous care of the house, its secrets whispered down through generations, and her father before him, a man as taciturn as the building itself, who believed in keeping The Abernathy House a haven, not just a residence.  And now, it was Amelia's turn to uphold the legacy - even if the whispers of Everleighâ€™s history were starting to feel a little too real.

The doors swung open again, revealing Mrs. Odell, the ever-vigilant house keeper, her eyes twinkling with mischief as she held a bouquet of lavender, the scent mingling with the salty air and the faint hum of Amelia's grandfather's piano in the distance. 
"There he is," Mrs. Odell whispered, "always found in his little corner of the world."
