## The Scent of Eucalyptus

**Setting:**  A dilapidated nursing home nestled in the sprawling coastal town of Seahaven, California. 

**Main Character:** Amelia "Amy" Carter, RN. A seasoned nurse with eyes that seemed to hold the stories of every patient who walked through the doors of Meadowbrook Manor. At 52, she carried the weight of countless sleepless nights and the unspoken grief of watching lives ebb away.  

The salty air whipped her hair around her face as Amy navigated the hallway, a symphony of creaking floorboards and muffled conversations filling her ears. The scent of eucalyptus - always present in the manor's worn-out atmosphere - hung heavy, thick with the memories of countless coughs and faded dreams. 

She stopped before room 312, the air thick with a strange tension that seemed to cling to the door like cobwebs. A sigh escaped her lips as she reached for the handle, hoping against hope that it wasn't another sleepless night ahead. The room was dim, lit by a single flickering bulb casting long shadows on the worn floral wallpaper.  

"Mr. Peterson?" Amy called out softly, but no reply answered her. 

She stepped inside, the air stifling in its silence, and noticed a faint, almost imperceptible movement in the corner of the room. Her heart pounded against her ribs like a trapped bird. This was not normal. Not for Meadowbrook Manor.
