Rain hammered against the windowpane of Millie Thorne's office like a thousand tiny fists. The faint, earthy aroma of coffee lingered in the air, battling with the musty scent of countless crumpled tax forms that lined the shelves, each one a silent testament to the anxieties of small business owners struggling to meet their obligations. The year was 2023, and Millie had been dealing with the peculiar quirks of individual income taxes for as long as she could remember, ever since she'd graduated from community college with a degree in accounting and a determination that burned brighter than any tax code.

Millie sat at her desk, surrounded by stacks of documents - receipts, W-2s, K-1 forms, the kind of paperwork that could turn even the most rational mind into a neurotic mess.  She rubbed a tired hand over her forehead, trying to quell the growing headache. This year felt different, though. The air was thick with an anxious energy, the kind you only experience when people are about to face financial uncertainty â€“ the kind she had spent years preparing for in this very small office of hers. It was as if the city itself was taking a deep breath before another storm, and Millie's job suddenly felt like standing at its edge, bracing for whatever might come crashing down.
