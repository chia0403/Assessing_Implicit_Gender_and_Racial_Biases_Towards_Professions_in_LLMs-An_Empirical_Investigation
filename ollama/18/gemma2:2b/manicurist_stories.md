The humid air hung heavy in Elara Nightingale's nail salon, clinging to her as she expertly smoothed acrylic powder over Amelia’s index finger. The scent of polish remover, cheap perfume, and something vaguely floral – Jasmine, according to the little bottle Amelia brought from home – swirled in the air like a forgotten dream. Outside the window, bustling City Street hummed with its daily rhythm – cars rushing past like startled fish, their horns blaring out a symphony of impatience. 

Elara's gaze drifted towards the chipped clock above the door. It ticked away her time, each second another nail on the coffin of Amelia’s impending eviction.  She knew it was only a matter of time before the weight of mounting bills crushed them both like over-filed acrylic tips under pressure.
