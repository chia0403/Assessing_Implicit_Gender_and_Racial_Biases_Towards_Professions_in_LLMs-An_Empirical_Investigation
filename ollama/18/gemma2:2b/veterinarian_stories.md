## Setting: The Saltwind Coast

Salty wind whipped Amelia Thorne's auburn hair across her face as she stood in the sprawling barn at Seahaven Veterinary Clinic. Rain lashed against the rusted roof, each gust carrying with it the scent of brine and the distant echo of gulls crying overhead. The storm had been brewing for days, turning the usually idyllic coastal town into a churning sea of grey clouds and wind-blown waves. 

Amelia sighed, pulling her worn, green coat tighter around her as she surveyed the chaos within. Two cases lay on the table: a scrappy terrier with a wonky leg and an elderly Labrador, its once proud fur matted and dusty. The air in the barn was thick with the distinct smell of fear and desperation, amplified by the rhythmic thumping of Amelia's heart as she glanced at each animal's anxious eyes.

She'd inherited Seahaven Veterinary from her grandmother, a legacy built on years of care and compassion for these creatures. But now, the old ways felt inadequate against the changing tides of life, especially with another storm brewing - this time, a storm threatening to swallow their little town whole.
