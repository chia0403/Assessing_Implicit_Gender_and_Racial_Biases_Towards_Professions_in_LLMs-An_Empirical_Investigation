Rain lashed against the windows of "The Cutting Room," its rhythm echoing the frantic beating of Amelia's heart as she stared at the reflection in her antique silver bowl.  It wasn't just the storm; it was everything that felt off today. The usual buzz of clippers and chatter had been replaced by an unsettling quiet, a silence punctuated only by the insistent drumming of rain on the glass. She glanced at her reflection again - Amelia, usually adorned with vibrant streaks of color in her hair, now looked like a pale ghost. Her usual fierce red was washed out, leaving behind a starkly muted gray, mirroring the mood that hung thick and heavy in the air.  The salon's grand chandeliers, normally sparkling with golden light, cast long, eerie shadows as if trapped beneath a shroud of melancholy. The storm had brought more than just rain - it seemed to have sucked the life out of everything, leaving Amelia stranded in its swirling chaos. 

Amelia took a deep breath and turned away from her reflection. She knew there was no time for introspection; she had a woman waiting, her face etched with anxiety and desperation. It was Mrs. Hawthorne, always impeccably dressed and perpetually burdened by the weight of expectation.  Every week, Amelia would tame her wild mane of gray, hoping to ease the constant stress that seemed to cling to the woman like a shroud. Today, however, Amelia sensed something more than just frayed nerves. There was fear in Mrs. Hawthorne's eyes - a fear that reverberated through the air as she entered the salon.
