Rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Amelia Nightingale's office, blurring the world outside into an impressionist landscape of gray and indigo. Inside, a fireplace crackled softly, struggling to keep the chill at bay.  Amelia took a slow sip of tea, its floral notes battling with the bitter tang of her own thoughts. A single candle on the mantelpiece cast dancing shadows on the worn leather sofa, where a client waited patiently. 

Tonight's session was particularly challenging. The air crackled with unspoken tension. Amelia had been working with Daniel for months, helping him navigate the fallout of his wife’s sudden death. His grief wasn’t merely sadness; it was a storm she felt in the marrow of her bones, reflected back at her by his clenched jaw and tear-filled eyes.  He hadn't spoken to anyone but her, not even his family. 

Amelia shifted in her chair, the familiar ache settling in her chest. She knew she had to help him through this, navigate these turbulent waters together. But as Daniel sat there, his silence a barrier between them, she wondered if their journey would ever end.
