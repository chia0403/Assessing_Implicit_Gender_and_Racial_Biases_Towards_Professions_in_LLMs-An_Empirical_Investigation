The air hung thick and greasy with diesel smoke and dust, a familiar scent to **Reginald "Reg" Bartholomew III** like his own sweat.  His rig – a hulking CAT 790 hauler - hummed and vibrated beneath him, its steel skin echoing the relentless roar of the quarry's demolition crew. The sun was setting, bleeding across the horizon like rust on an old iron gate, casting the Montana landscape in long shadows that stretched further than any man could hope to traverse. 

Reg wasn't your average operator; he wasn't satisfied with just moving earth and gravel. This was his stage, his art form: sculpting landscapes from the unforgiving rock face of Mount Diablo.  His father had taught him to respect the mountain’s raw power – a lesson etched into his very bones and instilled in every turn of his massive machine.  But today's work felt different. 

A tremor ran through Reg's knees, an unnerving premonition that something wasn't right. The usual symphony of clangs and groans from the demolition crew seemed to have lost its rhythm; a silent tension hung in the air. It was like watching the mountain itself hold its breath before unleashing a storm.
