## The Case of the Missing Veneer

**Setting:**  A sunny Tuesday in the sleepy seaside town of Oakhaven, Maine. 

The aroma of salt air mixed with freshly baked cookies wafted through Dr. Amelia Thorne's quaint dental practice, a charming Victorian building with peeling paint and ivy creeping up its facade. Inside, the waiting room hummed with the comforting quietude of nervous anticipation.  A child, no older than six, clutched his teddy bear as he anxiously awaited his turn for a filling appointment. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia Thorne, a woman in her late thirties whose youthful eyes held the wisdom gleaned from years spent meticulously crafting smiles into reality. Today, however, that smile was strained, her usual calm replaced by an uneasy tension. The missing veneer of patient Robert "Bobby" Johnson's front tooth had been found under her chair and was as perplexing to her as it was unsettlingly personal. 


**Opening:**

“Mrs. Henderson, I trust your son Bobby is in good spirits?” Amelia asked with a gentle smile, her eyes meeting Mrs. Henderson’s worried one. A small, barely audible sniffle escaped from the woman's lips. “He seems to be fine, but his nerves are frayed. You know how it is when they have to go through something like this.”

Amelia glanced at the empty space where Bobby was supposed to be, her gaze lingering on the chair before returning to Mrs. Henderson.  "I just... I can't quite explain this," Amelia said quietly, picking up a silver tray from the table as if trying to hold back a tide of anxious thoughts. "It seems almost like it vanished into thin air." She frowned, then sighed. “The case feels even more peculiar when you consider his mother found it under my chair.”
