## Setting:  A secluded coastal town in Maine known as Havenwood - 

The air was thick with salt spray and the low rumble of approaching thunderclouds.  Waves crashed against the rocky shore below, their sound punctuated by a lone figure pacing on the weathered wooden steps leading to the old lighthouse overlooking the crashing ocean.  Inside the imposing structure of the lighthouse, Professor Amelia "Amy" Sinclair, her greying hair pulled back tight in a bun, surveyed the swirling storm brewing around her. 

It had been years since she'd faced such an intense tempest. Years since she had last felt anything other than that crushing, inescapable loneliness. The storm mirrored the one raging inside her; a mix of grief and anger for the life she had lost - a life intertwined with the vibrant energy of Havenwood, a life once filled with joy and purpose.  Now, the only sounds she could hear were the rhythmic crash of waves and the persistent whirring of an antique clock in the lighthouse's attic room - the only remaining vestige of her late husband, John's, legacy. 

**Chapter One: A Night of Shadows & Whispers.** 
The first drop of rain hit the roof, followed by a steady cascade that echoed through the stone walls.  Amy clutched her worn copy of "Legends of Havenwood" to her chest, a book filled with whispered tales of phantom sailors and the haunting secrets buried in the town's history. Tonight was the night; the anniversary of John's tragic death.  Her memories of him were vivid: the warm glow of his smile reflected in the fiery orange sunset, his laughter echoing on the cliffs above as he taught her about constellations, each star a promise whispered into the void.
