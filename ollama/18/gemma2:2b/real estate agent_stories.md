The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Thorne's shoulders as she stepped out of her SUV onto the dusty driveway. Her crisp white linen shirt clung to her like a second skin, contrasting starkly with the dry, red dust that swirled around her ankles.  Today was another day in Paradise Valley, an idyllic mountain town nestled amidst sprawling pines and sagebrush, where even the air smelled faintly of pine needles and something distinctly nostalgic, almost as if history were clinging to its very walls.

Amy’s office windows overlooked a sprawling cul-de-sac lined with modern Victorian houses, each one boasting a different shade of pink, lavender, or rose – a testament to the town's penchant for anything floral.  She’d been in Paradise Valley for just over a year now, and even after all these months, she still found herself falling into a familiar pattern: the routine of meeting potential buyers, the tedious task of drafting contracts, the ever-present pressure of selling homes that felt more like emotional attachments to the owners than mere transactions. 

Today’s listing was particularly intriguing. A Victorian bungalow built in the early 1900's had been left to decay in the hands of a family who hadn't quite grasped the concept of modern living.  Amy knew she could breathe life into this charming old house, but as she watched the dust settle in the afternoon light, one thing was clear: Paradise Valley held more secrets than she ever imagined.
