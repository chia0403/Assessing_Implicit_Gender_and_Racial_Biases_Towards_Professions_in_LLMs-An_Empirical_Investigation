The biting wind whistled across Ethan Blackwood's face, stinging his cheeks as he gripped the steering wheel of his old Ford pickup. Snow fell in heavy flakes, blanketing the familiar pines and spruce of the Pacific Northwest in a white shroud. He squinted at the rising sun, its faint orange light barely breaking through the storm clouds. A chill settled deep in his bones, an echo of the gnawing unease that had been growing in his chest for weeks. 

Ethan Blackwood was a man shaped by the forest.  He'd grown up amongst the towering trees and roaring rivers, learned to read their whispers in the rustle of leaves and the groaning of old-growth timber. His life was a quiet dance between man and wood, his hands calloused from years of felling giant pines and shaping timber into sturdy beams. He wasn't afraid of the wilderness; he felt it within him, understood its secrets as well as his own heartbeat. But something was off this time, something that tugged at the corners of his mind like a loose thread in his worn flannel shirt. 

The storm was supposed to bring more than just snow and wind. The whispers had been growing louder for weeks now - warnings from the elders about an ancient pact being broken. An agreement made between the people and the forest, one that seemed to be unraveling with each passing winter.  It felt as if the forest itself was changing, its very essence simmering with a strange kind of untamed energy.
