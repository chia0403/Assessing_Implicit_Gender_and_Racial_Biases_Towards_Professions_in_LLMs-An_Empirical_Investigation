The scent of lavender polish clung to Agnes's apron as she surveyed the sprawling Victorian mansion for the tenth time that day. The place was a labyrinth of dusty corners, looming staircases, and echoing halls, each inch of it brimming with secrets that refused to be unearthed. This wasn't just any house; this was Thornton Manor, an opulent monument to a forgotten dynasty, now shrouded in a perpetual twilight of neglect. Agnes, a woman of simple pleasures – sunshine after rain, a freshly baked apple pie, the gentle rustle of silk sheets – found herself strangely drawn to its melancholic charm. 

She was no stranger to the weight of responsibility. For fifteen years, she had been the housekeeper for the manor's solitary heir, Lord Adrian Blackwood, who only ever seemed to appear in the late afternoon, his pale face shrouded in shadows. Tonight, however, a wave of unease rippled through Agnes’s bones as she encountered a peculiar sight – a locked door hidden behind a tapestry depicting a stormy sea, its edges frayed and faded like an old life story.  Agnes pushed forward, her heart hammering against her ribs, the secrets of Thornton Manor whispering their truth in her ear.
