##  A Plague on the Plaza

**Setting:** A bustling, chaotic plaza in Santa Cruz, California.  Palm trees sway above the cobblestone streets, and tourists mingle with locals. The air is thick with the scent of salt air and freshly caught fish, but also a subtle undercurrent of unease – an uncharacteristic stillness hangs over the usual vibrancy of the Plaza.

**Main Character:** Amelia "Amy" Chen, sharp-eyed and quick-witted, her years as a Physician's Assistant in Santa Cruz's bustling health clinic having honed both her diagnostic skills and her cynical observations of humanity. 


**Opening Lines:**
"It started with a whisper," Amy muttered, swirling her coffee between her hands. The Plaza was usually alive with the chatter of vendors, tourists, and locals alike, but today there was a hushed tension in the air that felt heavier than usual. "People were whispering about it – a sickness, they called it." She glanced out at the deserted benches and fountain statues, their once playful figures now stark against the backdrop of an unnervingly empty Plaza.  "The only sound was the insistent hum of the city's AC units. Even the ocean seemed to hold its breath." Amy ran a hand through her short, dark hair, feeling the familiar unease that came with navigating uncharted waters in life and medicine. "I just hope it isn’t something more than a mere summer bug," she sighed.
