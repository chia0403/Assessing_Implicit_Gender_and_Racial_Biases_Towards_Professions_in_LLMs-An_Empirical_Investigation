The crisp autumn air bit at Dr. Eleanor Vance's cheeks as she walked down Main Street in Oakhaven. The wind whipped fallen leaves into swirling eddies around her feet, each gust carrying a hint of cinnamon and woodsmoke from the nearby bakery. She pulled her woolen scarf tighter against the chill while scanning the bustling sidewalk. It was October 10th, Halloween week, and every storefront seemed to be playing up the spooky season with their decorations – ghosts, witches, ghouls. But Eleanor wasn't interested in the usual tricks of the trade, not this year. She had a serious case of "the kid whisperers" - as she preferred to call it - on her mind.

Dr. Vance was Oakhaven High School’s resident school psychologist.  She understood better than most the complex dance between childhood anxieties and teenage rebellion, the subtle nuances of social dynamics that made up the fabric of a school year. But this year felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, palpable like an unshed tear. Dr. Vance wasn't sure what was amiss, but she knew it had something to do with the new student, Ethan Wilder. 

Ethan was as enigmatic as he was alluring. Tall and thin with a shock of black hair and eyes that seemed to hold galaxies within their depths, he walked through life as though he was already an author writing his own story. His absence from his first class had been noticed by Dr. Vance.  He had disappeared on the very day she started observing him – a fact that only fueled her curiosity even more.
