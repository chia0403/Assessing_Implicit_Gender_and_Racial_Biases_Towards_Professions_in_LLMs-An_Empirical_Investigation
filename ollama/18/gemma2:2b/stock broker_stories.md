Teddy's focus was on the flickering green numbers of the ticker tape across his monitor: "STARK," "BANKS," "MILLER"â€”the names swam before him like ghosts of dreams long passed.  He yearned for something more than the relentless grind of making a living in the fast-paced world he had inherited, a world that seemed increasingly hollow and meaningless to him.
