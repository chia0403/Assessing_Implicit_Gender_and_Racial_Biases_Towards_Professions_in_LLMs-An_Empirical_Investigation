The wind whipped at Jeremiah "Jeb" Colton's face, tasting of sagebrush and dust as he stared out across the sprawling plains of Wyoming.  His weathered hands clutched a steaming mug of coffee, its warmth barely penetrating the biting chill that settled in his bones even on this sun-drenched morning. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of orange and purple, but Jeb's gaze remained fixed on the horizon where the mountains rose like sentinels against the fading light.  He was a man of few words, accustomed to solitude as much as he was to cattle. His ranch, "Iron Ridge," sprawled across three thousand acres, an island of civilization in the vast, unforgiving landscape. Jeb had inherited it from his father, a legacy etched into every crooked post and weathered fence line. But tonight, something felt different. A prickle at the back of his neck, a sense of unease that settled deeper than any storm cloud brewing over his ranch.  

The setting sun cast long shadows across Iron Ridge as Jeb’s weary eyes scanned the cattle herd grazing in the distance.   He'd always preferred the company of his animals to the gossiping townsfolk, but tonight even their placid demeanor seemed to be hiding something. A feeling that something was amiss was thickening into a knot in Jeb’s stomach. He needed answers.
