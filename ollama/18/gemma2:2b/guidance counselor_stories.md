Rain hammered against the windows of Northgate High's counseling center, blurring the cityscape into an abstract watercolor of greys and blues.  Inside, Ms. Amelia Grant, a woman whose age was as elusive as the wispy smoke curling from her ancient teacup, sat hunched over a stack of student folders. A symphony of teenage angst played out in her mind: the angsty whispers about college admissions, the panicked texts about failing grades, the simmering resentment towards the school's "unrealistic" expectations. 

She sighed, the sound lost to the storm raging outside. This was one of those nights when Amelia felt like she'd been wading through a sea of unmet potential, each student a tiny island on which her own small boat had little room to navigate. Her eyes skimmed through the latest report - another one of her students, Daniel Lee, seemingly spiraled towards an abyss of self-doubt and apathy. 

Amelia yearned to help him find his way back from the brink, but where were the clear pathways in this confusing maze of teenage anxieties? The storm outside mirrored the turmoil in her own chest, leaving her with a gnawing unease that clung to the air like a phantom fog.
