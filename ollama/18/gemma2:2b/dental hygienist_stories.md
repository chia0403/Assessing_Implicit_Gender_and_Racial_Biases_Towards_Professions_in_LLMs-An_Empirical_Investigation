The whirring of the high-powered scaler felt like a comforting heartbeat in Amelia Hayes' ears. The sterile, white walls of Dr. Johnson's office were as familiar to her as her own bedroom - a sanctuary of order and predictability in the whirlwind that was most people's reality. Today, she had two patients left on her schedule before her break.  A young woman named Emily, shy and anxious about her first checkup, sat nervously in the chair while Amelia worked through a routine cleaning. 

Amelia adjusted the light above them, making sure it bathed their faces in its warm glow. Outside, the city's skyline shimmered under the late afternoon sun, casting long shadows across the sidewalk. But within these four walls, time seemed to have a different rhythm. The gentle hum of the scaler was the only sound that mattered, punctuated occasionally by Dr. Johnson's gentle instructions or Emily’s quiet sighs. It was here, amidst the familiar scent of antiseptic and freshly-washed instruments, that Amelia found her own small world of order and comfort. 

The sun dipped lower, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple as Amelia finished cleaning Emily's teeth. She glanced at the clock – a moment before her break – feeling a familiar pang of contentment mixed with the bittersweet sting of knowing this routine was about to end.
