The steam from Amelia's morning chai clung to her like an ethereal shawl as she watched the sun bleed orange across the horizon. She stood on the edge of Lake Tahoe, its icy turquoise water mirroring the vibrant dawn. The crisp mountain air whipped through her auburn hair, carrying with it the scent of pine and wet earth. It was a picture postcard setting, but today, Amelia felt anything but serene. 

Her gaze drifted across the bustling therapy clinic in the distance, a beacon against the rising sun.  The weight of another patient's shattered ankle felt like a leaden cloak around her shoulders. Just yesterday she'd been at the peak of her career, guiding young athletes back to their prime. Now, she found herself surrounded by people whose lives had been fractured -  old women with painful knees, stroke victims, and those battling chronic pain. The constant struggle was wearing her down, chipping away at her optimism like sand on a beach. 

Amelia adjusted the satchel slung across her shoulder. She wasn't sure what she needed today: coffee to fight the fog in her mind, or an escape into the mountains to clear it all? Either way, she felt trapped between the weight of others' burdens and her own growing despair.
