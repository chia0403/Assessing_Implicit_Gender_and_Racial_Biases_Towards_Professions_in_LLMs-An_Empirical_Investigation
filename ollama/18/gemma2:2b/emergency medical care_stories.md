Rain lashed against the windows of the ambulance like tiny fists pounding on a battered drum. Inside, the air was thick with tension, not from the storm itself, but from the urgency radiating off Amelia "Amy" Hayes.  She glanced at the man in the driver's seat, his face creased with worry lines as deep as the valley carved into the mountainside outside their window. It was bad. Really bad. The victim, a young hiker named Jackson Thorne, had been found unconscious on the summit of Mount Redcliff after what looked like a brutal fall from above. 

Amy’s stomach churned. She'd treated her fair share of trauma cases, but the sheer scale of this injury –  a mangled limb almost severed at the elbow, cascading blood staining the snow and ice – was unlike anything she'd ever encountered. The mountain air was thin, biting at their exposed skin, but Amy's focus remained on Jackson's fragile life hanging by a thread. As she donned her gloves and carefully began assessing his injuries, she realized she wasn’t just dealing with a medical crisis; she was facing the harsh reality of a battle against nature's unforgiving wrath.
