The hum of fluorescent lights buzzed like a frustrated bee in the otherwise silent cavern that was Mr. Bartholomew "Bart" Winthrop's domain.  It wasn’t just any old office building; this was the headquarters of The Paragon Corporation, a name whispered with reverence and fear in equal measure. Bart, a man whose life had been as meticulously ordered as the gleaming chrome surfaces he cleaned day after day, felt an unsettling shiver run down his spine despite the worn out flannel shirt he wore.  He’d heard it all - tales of late-night phone calls that ended in whispered threats, hushed arguments between executives in glass-walled offices, and rumors of a clandestine research facility hidden deep within the building's depths. Bart, with his years of quiet observation from behind his mop bucket, was privy to it all. Tonight, however, felt different. Tonight, something was amiss. 


**Setting:** The headquarters of The Paragon Corporation in Chicago, Illinois. 
* **Time:** Late evening, after the office staff had gone home.
* **Mood:**  Silent and oppressive; a sense of unease hangs heavy in the air.   
* **Characters:**
    * **Bart Winthrop:** A solitary janitor, known for his observant skills and quiet demeanor, who has seen it all. 


**Next steps:**  

1. Introduce another character that Bart interacts with tonight (e.g., a night security guard or a strange visitor).
2. Focus on a specific detail in the building's layout or a hidden space that will provide a clue to the mystery.
3. Develop tension and foreshadowing, leading to an event that triggers Bart’s curiosity or raises his concern.
