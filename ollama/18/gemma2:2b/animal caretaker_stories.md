Rain lashed against the windows of Harmony Ridge Animal Sanctuary, blurring the already melancholic view outside into streaks of grey.  Inside, the air was thick with the scent of hay and damp fur.  Amelia Blackwood, hands calloused and strong from years of tending to the animals, carefully filled a water bowl for Willow, a silver-haired Border Collie whose spirit seemed as wilted as the flowers in her neglected pen. The sanctuary felt different tonight - heavier, more oppressive than usual. It wasn't just the storm raging outside; it was the news she'd received earlier that day.

**Setting:** A small, cozy animal sanctuary nestled deep within a sprawling valley, surrounded by rolling hills and lush forests.  The animals at Harmony Ridge were rescued from all walks of life: injured birds, abandoned kittens, feral cats, and even a lone wolf who had lost his pack.  It was Amelia's sanctuary; a haven for the neglected and unwanted.  

**Character:**  Amelia Blackwood - A woman in her late 50s with sharp eyes, worn but compassionate hands, and a quiet strength that emanated from within. She'd dedicated her life to caring for these animals after losing her husband and finding solace in their silent companionship.
