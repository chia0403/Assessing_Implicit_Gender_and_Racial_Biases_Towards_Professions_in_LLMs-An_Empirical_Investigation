Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the furious drumming in Evelyn Blackwood's chest.  Dust motes danced like restless spirits in the weak beam from the single overhead bulb, illuminating faded floral wallpaper and stacks of books she could never hope to read. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and forgotten memories. Her fingers tapped against her laptop, a frustrated rhythm echoing through the lonely room. 

Evelyn was a writer. A wordsmith. Yet, here she sat in this forgotten corner of her grandmother's house, staring at a blank screen, the cursor mocking her with its relentless blinking.  Her latest novel had stalled, each page seeming to resist her pen. The setting - a crumbling Victorian mansion on the edge of a remote Scottish moor - felt more like a prison than inspiration. 

The rain intensified, blurring the street lights into smudges of grey. A gust rattled the windowpane, and Evelyn swore she heard whispers in the wind.  Whispers that sounded suspiciously like the words to her novel's climax...or maybe it was just the storm finally getting to her. Either way, time seemed to stretch before her, each second a mountain peak threatening to collapse under the weight of her writer's block.
