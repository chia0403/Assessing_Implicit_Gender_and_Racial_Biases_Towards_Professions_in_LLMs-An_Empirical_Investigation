The humid air clung to Dr. Amelia "Amy" Carter's blouse like a second skin as she stood in her clinic waiting room. The scent of disinfectant mingled with the faint floral aroma of the essential oils Amy was testing out for her stress relief program – chamomile and lavender, surprisingly popular amongst her patients. She watched an elderly woman fidget impatiently, clutching a worn handbag with trembling hands. 

Amy felt the familiar weight of responsibility settle upon her shoulders. Each patient who walked through those doors presented a unique puzzle, their lives intertwined in ways she never anticipated when she chose to become a chiropractor. Amy wasn't just adjusting spines; she was piecing together the human jigsaw puzzle, finding the missing pieces that allowed her patients to move through life with greater ease and grace.

The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the cluttered waiting room as a new patient entered – young David, his posture hunched over like a wilting flower. He carried a backpack overflowing with textbooks and the weight of an impending college application deadline. 

"Ms. Carter?" he mumbled, voice tight and strained. "I, uh… I think my back needs adjusting."
