The scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, blending with the faint hum of old-world jazz emanating from the record player tucked away behind the reception desk.  This was Elara's sanctuary â€“ not just her workspace, but also a reflection of the calm she sought to bring to others. Elara, whose name was a beautiful whisper of stars and moonlight, had cultivated a haven in this cozy San Francisco apartment building. 

As always, clients were trickling in, lured by the promise of pain relief.  A young couple seeking to ease post-wedding tension, an aging businessman with lingering stress from his demanding career, even a stressed-out social media influencer who wanted Elara to work her magic on stiff shoulders that couldn't handle another day of selfie-worthy poses. 

Tonight, though, Elara felt a strange premonition as she glanced at the clock - it was almost time for the new client, the one with eyes like storm clouds and hands trembling like willow branches.  Her name was Amelia Blackwood, and her appointment wasn't scheduled until later, but Elara had been drawn to her presence like a moth to a flame.
