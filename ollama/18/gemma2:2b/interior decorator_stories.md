##  The Velvet Room

**Opening:** 

Rain hammered against the windows of Amelia Thorne's studio, each drop like tiny fists pounding on glass. The city lights, usually glittering and welcoming like distant stars, were now blurry and distorted through the downpour. Inside the studio, however, was a stark contrast – an oasis of calm amidst the storm. A symphony of soft music played from an old record player, its rhythm punctuated by bursts of laughter as Amelia surveyed her latest creation. 

She adjusted the position of a velvet armchair in her living room-sized mock-up, her gaze lingering on the fabric's rich crimson hue.  It was far more than just a piece of furniture; it was a portal to another world, a reflection of the client's dreams for his sprawling estate. The entire project was a challenge – bringing the owner’s vision, a blend of Victorian grandeur and modern minimalism, to life on canvas. 

Amelia knew this job wasn't just about mixing colours and textures; it was about weaving stories.  She could practically see the grand ballroom dance of a hundred years past echoing in these walls, a ghost of forgotten elegance, as she meticulously placed a vintage gold-leaf mirror against the fireplace's worn brick. 

**Setting:**

Amelia Thorne’s studio is located in a historic Victorian townhouse on the edge of London's bustling Soho district. It's crammed with treasures – antique furniture covered in plush velvet, faded tapestries hanging from the high ceilings, and bookshelves overflowing with leather-bound journals. The scent of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the dusty aroma of aged wood. Outside, the relentless rain continued its assault on the city, yet inside, Amelia was a bastion of calm, surrounded by the echoes of the stories she'd helped shape.  


**Main Character:**

Amelia Thorne – a woman whose passion for interior design was matched only by her sharp wit and even sharper sense of aesthetics. A decade into her career, Amelia has built a reputation as an expert in blending old-world charm with modern sensibilities, creating spaces that were both timeless and captivating.
