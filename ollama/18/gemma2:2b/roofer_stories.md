Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the shed like angry fists.  Inside, huddled on a wobbly stool, sat Marcus 'Mac' O'Connor, his brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously tightened a metal bracket with pliers. The air hung thick and heavy, filled with the smell of ozone, sawdust, and the lingering dampness of yesterday’s downpour.  He adjusted the angle of a worn-out ladder propped against the wall, a familiar ache settling deep in his right shoulder. He'd been working since sunrise – replacing shingles on the sprawling Victorian mansion that sat on the hill like a decaying queen. 

Mac was built for this life: rough and calloused hands, sunburnt face weathered by years of work under the unforgiving glare of the sun.  He wasn’t your typical roofer; his heart didn't belong in the sky-high world of construction cranes and concrete jungles. No, Mac found solace in the quiet symphony of wind whistling through shingles, a sense of accomplishment that came from seeing a storm-battered structure stand proud once more. He was a craftsman of sorts, and this old house felt like his canvas.

But there was a shadow lingering in the back of his mind, an uneasy whisper that seemed to grow louder every time he saw the old woman's face etched with worry on her front porch: Mrs. Evelyn Thornhill. She’d been his neighbour for years,  a gentle soul with eyes that held the stories of a thousand lives lived and lost. And now, she had called him, again, about a problem with her attic – an unsettling feeling she couldn't quite articulate, something lurking just beneath the surface of their quiet town.
 
As he finished securing the last bracket, Mac caught sight of Mrs. Thornhill’s figure standing by the window, her silhouette framed by the storm clouds.  He swallowed hard, his heart thumping against his ribs like a trapped bird. This wasn't just another leaky roof; there was something more here, something that resonated deep in his gut and made him feel strangely…charged. It all felt too familiar, yet impossibly distant at the same time.

This wasn’t just about fixing roofs.  It was about facing the storm within.
