The late afternoon sun bled through the blinds, painting fractured squares of light across Dr. Elias Thorne's worn desk.  He sat slumped in his chair, chin resting on his hand, staring at a photograph that seemed to mock him with its cheerful simplicity. A young woman, her eyes wide and innocent, stood beaming beside a vibrant orange sunset. Next to her, a little boy, barely five years old, held out a bright blue crayon for the camera. The air felt thick, suffocating in his cluttered office, filled with the stale scent of paperclips, coffee, and suppressed rage.  

The photograph was meant to be a symbol of hope, of a family life that seemed impossibly far away now. But Elias’s eyes couldn't find it. Instead, all he saw was the wreckage – a case so complex, twisted, and horrifying that even his expertise felt inadequate. He was on the verge of burning out, haunted by memories of the missing child, Liam Miller. The last case before this one had been just as perplexing, and just as tragic. But something about this case…this little boy’s smile, the way it seemed to mock Elias’s despair…it felt different, like a crack in the ice that threatened to engulf him entirely.

Elias Thorne, Ph.D., Forensic Psychologist, sat there, trapped in the labyrinthine halls of his mind, unsure how to navigate this new, terrifying storm. The phone on his desk buzzed – another unanswered call from the police department.  He’d been told they were sending a team down to interview the family, but he already knew what it would be like - another wall built of fragmented memories and silent accusations. 

The case was a nightmare, and Elias felt hopelessly lost in its darkness.
