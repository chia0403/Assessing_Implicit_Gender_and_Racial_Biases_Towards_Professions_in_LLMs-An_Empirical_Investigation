Rain hammered against the worn, corrugated metal roof of the station, mimicking the insistent drumbeat in Elias's chest. The wind shrieked through the towering pines surrounding their little town of Pinewood, whipping sheets of water sideways and threatening to pull loose shingles from the aging building. It was a night like this that made him yearn for the calm before the storm, when his days were filled with routine: pulling out hoses, checking alarms, and maybe even helping Mrs. Peabody's pet chicken escape her coop (again). But tonight, something felt off, heavy. Not just from the rain or the wind, but from a kind of expectant hush that seemed to permeate every corner of Pinewood.

Elias, known throughout the small town as "Eli" by everyone except his colleagues, was adjusting his helmet, its visor reflecting the eerie, flickering orange light of the dispatcher's screen: "Multiple reports of... something... in the woods." The words hung heavy in the air. He looked out at the rain-soaked landscape, a stark silhouette painted against the dying embers of the sunset.  The woods held their secrets close, and tonight, they seemed to be whispering a warning he couldn't quite decipher.
