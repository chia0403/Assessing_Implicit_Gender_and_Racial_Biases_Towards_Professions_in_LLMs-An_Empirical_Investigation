The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and fresh blood, an aroma that clung to Elias Thorne like the ghosts of his family's legacy. He stood in the heart of his small-town butcher shop, "Thorne & Co." – its wooden sign creaking gently above him as a gust of wind whistled through the gaps in the old building’s siding.  The late afternoon sun cast long shadows on the worn brick floors, turning the world outside into a blur of muted colours and deepening twilight.

Elias sighed, pushing his greasy apron away from his lean frame. The familiar symphony of clanging meat cleavers and chopping boards, the guttural rumble of the old-fashioned refrigerator humming in the back, held him captive. It was his lifeblood, this relentless, rhythmic dance with death, but it also felt like a cage. Tonight, however, even the scent of iron and sweat seemed to suffocate him. There was something unsettling about tonight's slaughter – something far from the usual routine.  He couldn’t quite put his finger on it. The silence between the rhythmic chopping of meat, the usual banter with the regular customers, the hushed murmurings of the old-timer behind the counter – all felt strangely off. He adjusted his cap, a heavy leather band covering his brow, and scanned the butcher block for anything out of place - a fleeting glimpse of something unworldly in the deadpan reflection of his own eyes.
