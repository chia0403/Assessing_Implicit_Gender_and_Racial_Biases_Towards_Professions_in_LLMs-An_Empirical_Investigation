The sun beat down on the sweat-soaked brow of Ezra Sterling, his hands working tirelessly to tame the unruly growth that plagued the back gardens of Mrs. Henderson's estate. The air hummed with the lazy buzz of cicadas and the distant call of an unseen bird, a chorus only slightly interrupted by the rhythmic click of his trowel as it carved through earth. His name was Ezra Sterling, not for the grander, more prestigious title he imagined himself possessing someday - but simply "Ezra," to the people who hired him, to those whose lives he touched with his work. Today's project, though, felt monumental: Mrs. Henderson had tasked him with transforming her once-wilted backyard into a veritable oasis of floral abundance, all within two days. 

The sprawling back garden was a symphony of chaos - unruly vines weaving their way through overgrown shrubs, daisies and dandelions struggling for space against the onslaught of weeds, and an air thick with damp earth and the faint scent of decaying leaves. Mrs. Henderson's home was stately and formal, but Ezra saw a hidden beauty beneath the tangled undergrowth, a yearning for something more than just the upkeep of order and decorum.
