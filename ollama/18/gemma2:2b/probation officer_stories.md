## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the grime-streaked windowpane, blurring the already muted light of dawn in Ms. Evelyn Thorne's office.  Evelyn Thorne sat at her desk, the worn mahogany polished to a gleam, reflecting the storm raging both outside and within her own weary soul. Across from her sat Marcus "Mac" Miller, a young man barely out of his teens, eyes red-rimmed and haunted by the storm not only in the sky but also in his own heart.  He had served three months in this very facility – The Ashwood House for Youth – before being transferred to probation, a bittersweet victory that felt more like defeat.

Evelyn’s life was a symphony of caution and resignation, orchestrated with years of training and experience as a probation officer in the notoriously corrupt city of New Alexandria.  The streets were rife with deceit and danger, and every interaction she had seemed designed to navigate the treacherous waters of youth, crime, and survival. The weight of countless stories, whispered secrets, and broken promises rested on her thin shoulders like an insurmountable burden. 

As Evelyn looked at Mac, a familiar ache throbbed in her chest – not just for him, but for every single person she’d encountered during her arduous journey through the bleak underbelly of society.  Was this ever-burning hope, that glimmer in the eyes of a reformed youth? Would it be enough to keep them afloat when the storm threatened to drown them all?
