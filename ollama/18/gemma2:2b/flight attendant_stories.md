## The Ballad of Amelia "Amy" Croft

**Setting:**  A luxury private jet cutting through the clouds over the Scottish Highlands. 

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the plush leather seats, illuminating the delicate floral patterns woven into the cushions. But even in this serene cocoon of luxury, an unsettling tension hung in the air.  It was the kind that could be heard in the low hum of the engine, felt in the subtle shift of the stewardess's chair as she adjusted her position by a passenger's side window, a silent storm brewing beneath the veneer of civility.

**Name:** Amelia "Amy" Croft 


Amy Croft adjusted her headphones and sighed, running a hand through her unruly brown hair. She was used to being in charge -  the quiet authority of a stewardess whose years of experience on a variety of international flights made her feel like an unspoken conductor orchestrating the smooth flow of passengers and their needs. But today, something felt off. The usual calm before take-off had been replaced with a prickling unease. 

She checked the passenger manifest again - a familiar group of faces from previous journeys: the tech magnate Mr. Patel, his daughter Priya; the flamboyant opera singer Madame Dubois; even the enigmatic Mr. Thorne, who always travelled alone and never spoke.  Today, however, something was different about Mr. Thorne's demeanor. He sat rigid in his chair, eyes fixed on some unseen point beyond the window, his usually polished suit looking unnaturally rumpled. 

A strange sense of foreboding settled upon Amy's heart as she looked at him. Even the most seasoned airliner crew could never be sure if a passenger's quietude signaled a simple daydream or something more unsettling. The question lingered in her mind, waiting to be answered before take-off.
