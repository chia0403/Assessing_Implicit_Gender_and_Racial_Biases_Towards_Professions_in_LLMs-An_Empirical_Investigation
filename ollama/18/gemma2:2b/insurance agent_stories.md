The humid New Orleans air clung to Theodore “Teddy” Dubois like an unwelcome second skin as he surveyed the latest disaster on his desk: a photo that could curdle even the most hardened soul. A half-submerged Victorian mansion with peeling paint and boarded windows stared back at him, its skeletal form twisted against the sky after a freak storm had ripped through the French Quarter. 

Teddy was accustomed to the mundane –  claims of leaky roofs, broken pipes, stolen wallets, and occasional family pet escapes. But this... this felt different. This house held an air of tragedy that he couldn’t shake off. He ran his fingers over the photo, wondering what kind of grief had driven its inhabitants to sell it off in this fashion. The name on the file was a painful reminder: Evelyn LeBlanc. 

Teddy's heart thrummed with a strange mixture of empathy and trepidation. The insurance world, for all its pragmatism, couldn't fully prepare you for the raw weight of human loss. This wasn't just about financial settlements or paperwork – this was about faces he’d only seen in his dreams, stories he hoped never to hear, and a life that had been ripped away by a storm too fierce even for the gods of New Orleans.
