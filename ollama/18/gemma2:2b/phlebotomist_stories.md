The sterile air hung thick in the waiting room like forgotten dreams. A lone woman sat slumped on the vinyl chair opposite Amelia "Amy" Pierce's station, her hands clenched so tightly her knuckles were white against her wrinkled palm. Amy sighed, running a hand over her tired face – another day, another ocean of worry. It was the same scene every Wednesday: a sea of pale faces and anxious whispers, punctuated by the rhythmic click of needles and the soft hiss of blood drawn from veins like ancient arteries.  

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly sheen on the worn-out couches and chipped porcelain mugs. The aroma of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a testament to the daily ritual that was her life - working as a phlebotomist at Mercy General Hospital. It wasn't glamorous work, far from it. But for Amy, this small world of tubes and needles was a haven – a place where she could navigate the chaos of human suffering and offer something akin to hope. 

Tonight, however, the ocean felt different. The usual wave of empathy she carried within her seemed muted, replaced by a knot in her gut that refused to loosen its grip.  As Amy stepped towards the woman's chair, an uneasy feeling settled upon her like winter's chill. This patient wasn't just another name on a ledger – this was a story waiting to unfold.
