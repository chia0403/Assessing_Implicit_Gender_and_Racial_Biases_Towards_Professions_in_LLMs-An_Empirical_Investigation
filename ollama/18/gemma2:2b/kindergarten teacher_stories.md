The aroma of applesauce and freshly cut crayons filled Ms. Eleanor Bell's classroom at Willow Creek Elementary. The morning light painted her students' faces in shades of orange and gold as they filed in, chattering like a flock of excited sparrows.  Ms. Bell, with her bright yellow polka-dotted apron and a smile that could disarm even the grumpiest toddler, greeted each one by name, offering an arm for hugs or a high five if needed. 

Today was "Storybook Parade" week, and anticipation hung in the air thicker than the glue Ms. Bell always used on her craft projects.  The kids were buzzing with excitement about their costumes â€“ a motley crew of pirates, princesses, construction workers, and even a few ferocious dragons.  Ms. Bell's heart swelled; she loved these moments, each one a tiny miracle in the whirlwind that was kindergarten.
