The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia's head like trapped bees in an industrial hive. The scent of cheap coffee lingered in the air, mingling with the ever-present undercurrent of stale popcorn and desperation that seemed to emanate from the worn carpet beneath her feet.  Amelia sighed, tapping away at the register screen, its glow a pale imitation of the sunset she was missing out on outside. Her name tag, "Amelia," read like a mocking reminder of her unfulfilled dreams as she scanned an array of discounted candy bars and overpriced cereal.

Her days were spent in this corner of the world: 3 p.m. slump, endless lines, and only the occasional flicker of human warmth from customers who just needed to buy milk for their kids. The place felt like a vacuum cleaner sucking the last bit of sunshine out of everything it touched.  Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, a storm brewed in Amelia's soul as she waited on a seemingly endless line of weary souls, each with a story she wasn't privy to.
