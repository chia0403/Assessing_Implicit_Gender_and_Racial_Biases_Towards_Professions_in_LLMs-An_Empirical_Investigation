The air shimmered with heat as Clint “Cluck” Cavanaugh wrestled the steering wheel of his behemoth rig, 'Betsy' - a 1987 Peterbilt aptly named for its imposing size and tendency to shake like an aging grandpa at a carnival. Clint had navigated countless miles on Betsy, her rumble a familiar soundtrack to the vast American landscape. Now, however, the familiar rhythm felt off-kilter.

He wasn't just carrying supplies; he was carrying grief, fear, and an unshakeable feeling that something deeply unsettling had been unleashed within the desert's heart.
