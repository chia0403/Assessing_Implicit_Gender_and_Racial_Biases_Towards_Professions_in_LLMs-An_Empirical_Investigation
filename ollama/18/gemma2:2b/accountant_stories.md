Rain lashed against the windows of Arthur Beaumont's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the glass panes.  Outside, the world was awash in an angry grey that mirrored the turmoil brewing inside him.  Arthur Beaumont, CPA, stared out at the storm with weary eyes. The year 2047 had been a bad one â€“ taxes were off the charts, global unrest simmered just below the surface, and his own family's future hung precariously by a thread. Tonight, he sat alone in his dimly lit office, the scent of stale coffee battling against the sharp, metallic tang of desperation clinging to his clothes. 

His world had always been one of neat rows of numbers, precise spreadsheets charting financial flows across global markets. He excelled at it, but even his meticulous mind seemed unable to decipher the swirling chaos that threatened to engulf him and his loved ones. Tonight, he was drowning in a sea of uncertainty, and Arthur Beaumont knew the storm within would only intensify if he didn't find a way to shore himself up before the tide broke.
