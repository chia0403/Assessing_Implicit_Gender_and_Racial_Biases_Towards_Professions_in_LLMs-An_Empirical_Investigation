The rain hammered against the rusty tin roof like tiny fists pounding on a cage door. Inside "Plumbing Pete's", the small shop was crammed with more pipe wrenches than sunshine, each one telling a story of countless jobs and leaky faucets.  Pete, a lanky man whose hands were stained with grease and his face perpetually lined from years spent under sinks and in tight spaces, wiped the greasy residue from his eyes. 

His name wasn't quite right either - "Plumbing Pete" was a nickname he embraced with pride. He preferred to be known as Peter McTavish, after the great-grandfather whose quiet stubbornness had instilled in him a dedication to fixing things, no matter how daunting the task. 

Today's challenge was a particularly stubborn one: Mrs. Henderson’s old Victorian house had refused to flush for weeks, and the stench from the overflowing toilet threatened to turn his stomach. The woman’s worried face, pale as the porcelain of her bathtub, haunted his thoughts as he pulled out his trusty assortment of tools. 


**Setting:** A small, bustling town in upstate New England, where time moves slower and the air smells of wood smoke and fallen leaves. 

**Main character:** Peter McTavish, a middle-aged plumber with a gruff exterior and a heart full of empathy for his customers' woes.
