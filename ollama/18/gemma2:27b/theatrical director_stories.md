The air backstage crackled with nervous energy, thick as the fog machine's haze that hung low over the set. Ophelia Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles, their frames catching the harsh glare of the single spotlight illuminating the stage manager's frantic scribbling on his clipboard.  A symphony of clanging props and hushed whispers filled the cavernous theater, punctuated by the occasional shriek from a startled actor who'd encountered a rogue feather boa in the dimness.

Ophelia inhaled deeply, savoring the scent of dust, sweat, and anticipation that permeated every inch of this grand old venue. The Rialto Theater, a relic of Art Deco splendor with ornate balconies and velvet curtains stained by decades of spilled champagne, was Ophelia's haven. Tonight, it would become the stage for her magnum opus - "The Phantom Violinist," an avant-garde reimagining of a classic ghost story.

A prickle of doubt danced at the edge of Ophelia's confidence. This production, with its elaborate sets, experimental lighting, and challenging score, was unlike anything she had attempted before. The pressure was immense. Critics were already circling, hungry for her downfall.
