Rain lashed against the windows of "Critter Comforts," blurring the neon sign outside into an abstract smear of pink and green. Inside, Dr. Amelia Blackwood sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair out of her tired eyes. The storm had been raging for hours, postponing her planned evening hike and trapping her in the clinic with only the rhythmic dripping from the gutters for company.

It wasn't that she minded being alone. In fact, the quiet moments were often when Amelia felt most at peace. Surrounded by the comforting scent of disinfectant and animal fur, she could lose herself in the intricate world of veterinary medicine, poring over case files or researching new treatments. But tonight, a gnawing restlessness kept her from settling. Something in the storm's mournful howl seemed to echo a deeper unease within her.

Just as she was about to brew a calming chamomile tea, the insistent buzz of the doorbell jolted her back to reality. Glancing at the clock – almost 9pm – Amelia wondered who could possibly be braving the treacherous weather.  With a mix of curiosity and trepidation, she made her way to the front door, bracing herself for whatever awaited her on the other side.
