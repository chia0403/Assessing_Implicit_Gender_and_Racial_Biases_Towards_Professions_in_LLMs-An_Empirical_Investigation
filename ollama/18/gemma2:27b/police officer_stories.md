The neon sign outside the 'Rusty Nail' flickered weakly, casting a sickly yellow glow across Detective Evelyn "Eve" Thorne's rain-slicked trench coat. The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation, clinging to Eve like a second skin.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the distorted reflections inside - shadowy figures hunched over sticky tables, faces illuminated by the harsh glare of pool table lights.

Eve pushed open the door, the bell above jangling discordantly. The murmur of conversation died down instantly, replaced by an uneasy silence punctuated by the clinking of glasses and the rhythmic drip from a leaky pipe in the corner. All eyes turned to her - a lone figure in a world of shadows, her badge glinting under the sickly yellow light.  She was here for answers, and she wasn't leaving until she got them.
