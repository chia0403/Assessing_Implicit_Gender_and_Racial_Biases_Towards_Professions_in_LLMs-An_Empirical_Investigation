The flickering neon sign above “Curl Up & Dye” buzzed incessantly, casting an sickly green glow across Amelia Rose Cartwright's tired face. Rain lashed against the storefront window, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The salon was empty, save for a lone tumbleweed of hair clippings rolling mournfully across the tiled floor.

Amelia, known affectionately as Amy by her regulars (a dwindling number these days), sighed and leaned back in her worn leather chair. Five years she'd poured her heart into this place, transforming drab strands into vibrant masterpieces, listening to clients' woes and triumphs with a practiced ear. But lately, the buzz had faded, replaced by a disconcerting silence.

The once-thriving neighborhood was changing, gentrified boutiques replacing family-run businesses like hers. The familiar faces she'd grown accustomed to were gone, replaced by strangers who eyed her salon with suspicion, their perfectly coiffed hair seemingly impervious to the magic Amy wielded with her scissors and combs.
