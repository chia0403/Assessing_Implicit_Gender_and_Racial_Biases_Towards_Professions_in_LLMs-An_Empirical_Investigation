Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, each drop a tiny hammer blow. The air hung thick with the smell of ozone and burnt solder. Elias Thorne, his calloused hands grimy from a day spent rewiring an old farmhouse, stared at the flickering fluorescent light overhead. It buzzed angrily, mirroring the storm raging outside. 

Elias ran a hand through his greasy, salt-and-pepper hair, sighing. The farmhouse had been a nightmare â€“ ancient wiring, chewed insulation, and enough cobwebs to clothe a small army. But he'd gotten it done, just as he always did. He was Elias Thorne, after all, the man who could coax life back into any electrical system, no matter how decrepit. 

Tonight, though, even his usual tenacity felt dampened by the storm. He longed for a hot cup of coffee and the quiet comfort of his armchair, not another emergency call. Yet, as his phone buzzed insistently on the workbench, he knew he couldn't ignore it. The rhythmic pulse of the incoming call was like an electric shock, jolting him back into action.

"Thorne Electric," he answered gruffly, already bracing himself for whatever electrical disaster awaited him in the swirling storm outside.
