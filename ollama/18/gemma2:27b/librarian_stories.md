Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Blackwood Library, each drop echoing like a tiny hammer blow on the ancient stained glass. The air smelled of damp paper and leather, mingled with the faint sweetness of cinnamon from Eleanor Winthrop's teacup. Eleanor, her silver hair neatly braided down her back, adjusted her spectacles and peered at the book before her â€“ a crumbling first edition of "The Odyssey," its pages fragile as butterfly wings.

The library, nestled in the heart of sleepy Ashton-on-Sea, was Eleanor's haven. Its towering shelves, crammed with centuries of knowledge, were her solace, each book whispering forgotten stories and untold secrets. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced down Eleanor's spine as a gust of wind rattled the windowpanes, momentarily plunging the room into darkness.

Suddenly, a loud thud from the far end of the library startled her. Eleanor's heart hammered against her ribs. No one else was supposed to be there. She carefully placed "The Odyssey" back on its shelf and, clutching her walking stick for courage, cautiously made her way towards the source of the sound.
