The humid air hung thick over Bleaker Street, a greasy film coating everything from the chipped paint on shop fronts to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' neatly trimmed beard. Bart leaned against the doorway of his barbershop, "Higgins & Sons," watching pigeons squabble over discarded crusts. The bell above the door jingled, announcing a customer. It was Mrs. O’Malley, her silver curls bouncing as she hurried in.

"Morning, Bartholomew!" she chirped, her eyes twinkling behind thick spectacles. "Just a trim today, dear. I'm off to see my granddaughter." Bart smiled, ushering her into the worn leather chair and draping a crisp white towel around her neck. The barbershop was his sanctuary – a world of mahogany shelves stacked with hair tonics and pomades, the comforting whir of clippers, and the low murmur of conversations. It had been in his family for generations, passed down from father to son, each leaving their mark on the worn floorboards and faded photographs lining the walls.  But lately, Bleaker Street was changing. Shiny new shops were sprouting up, pushing out old-timers like Bart. He knew he couldn't compete with their slick marketing and fancy lattes, but this barbershop, with its history etched into every corner, was more than just a business – it was his legacy.
