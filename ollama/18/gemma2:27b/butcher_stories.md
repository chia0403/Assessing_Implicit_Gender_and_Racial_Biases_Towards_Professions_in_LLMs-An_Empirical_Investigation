The air hung thick with the scent of iron and brine, a symphony familiar to Bartholomew "Butcher Bart" Higgins.  His shop, Higgins' Meats, nestled snugly on Bleaker Street, was bathed in the pale, pre-dawn light filtering through the grimy windowpane. Outside, the cobblestones were slick with a recent rain, reflecting the muted colors of the awakening city. But inside, Bartholomew moved with practiced ease, his cleaver flashing like silver lightning as he broke down a side of beef.

The rhythmic thud of the cleaver against bone was punctuated by the low hum of the ancient meat grinder in the corner. It was a beast of a machine, its gears worn smooth from years of service, churning out sausage with a satisfying crunch. Bartholomew's calloused hands worked with precision and care, each movement honed by decades spent mastering his craft. He wasn't just a butcher; he was an artist, sculpting flesh into culinary masterpieces.

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Bartholomew's spine as he glanced at the shadowed alleyway behind his shop.  The silence there was unnerving, broken only by the distant screech of a crow. He dismissed it as pre-dawn jitters, focusing on the task at hand. Yet, the feeling persisted, a nagging sense that something was amiss in the familiar gloom of Bleaker Street.
