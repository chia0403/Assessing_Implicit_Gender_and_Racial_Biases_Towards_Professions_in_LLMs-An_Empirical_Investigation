The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and desperation. Amelia Rose Hawthorne stared at the lopsided, buttercream-laden monstrosity before her, her reflection distorted in its glistening surface. It was supposed to be a three-tiered masterpiece – roses cascading down ivory fondant, delicate sugar pearls twinkling like dewdrops. Instead, it resembled a melting snowman attacked by a pack of rabid squirrels.

Amelia's bakery, "Sweet Surrender," usually buzzed with the cheerful clatter of trays and the sweet hum of contented customers. Today, however, the silence was broken only by the frantic ticking of the antique clock on the wall, mirroring the relentless pounding in Amelia's chest. Her biggest client, the notoriously demanding Mrs. Vandergelt, was due to arrive any minute for her daughter's wedding cake tasting.  

Amelia glanced at the crumpled sketch lying discarded beside her mixing bowl – a testament to her late-night vision that had somehow gone horribly awry. She needed a miracle, and fast, if she wanted to avoid the wrath of Vandergelt, who was known to reduce grown men to quivering jelly with a single icy glare.
