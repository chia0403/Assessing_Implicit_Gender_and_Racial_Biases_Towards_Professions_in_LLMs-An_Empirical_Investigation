Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the neon "Petal & Plume" sign into an impressionistic smear of pink and green. Inside, Eloise Beatrice Hawthorne hummed along to Billie Holiday's smoky voice, weaving lilies and lavender into a fragrant cascade for a funeral bouquet. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming roses, a familiar comfort in the dreary afternoon. Outside, the cobbled street of Notting Hill pulsed with grey, mirroring the gloom settling over Eloise's heart. She glanced at the faded photograph taped to her workbench: a beaming young woman with auburn curls and eyes the color of forget-me-nots â€“ her grandmother, Beatrice, who had taught her everything she knew about coaxing beauty from nature. Today marked the anniversary of her passing, and Eloise felt a familiar ache, a longing for the gentle guidance of her hands and the comforting aroma of her lavender perfume.
