Grease stained his calloused fingertips like badges of honor. Silas "Sly" Montgomery wiped them on his already oil-stained rag with a grunt, squinting at the mangled mess under the hood of the rusted Chevy pickup. The late summer sun beat down on Sly's Auto Repair, baking the asphalt lot and turning the air thick and heavy. Cicadas buzzed their incessant symphony from the overgrown elm trees bordering the lot, providing a soundtrack to Sly's frustration. This wasn't just any engine trouble; it was a tangled web of broken parts and frayed wires that screamed "someone messed with this on purpose." 

Sly sighed, knowing he wouldn't be leaving his shop anytime soon. The smell of gasoline and burnt oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to him. It was a scent that whispered tales of grit, determination, and the quiet satisfaction of bringing something broken back to life.  But this time, Sly suspected something more sinister lurked beneath the Chevy's hood.
