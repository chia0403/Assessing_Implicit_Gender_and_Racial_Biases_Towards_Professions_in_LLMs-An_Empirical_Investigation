Elias Thorne wiped sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, his eyes squinting against the glare reflecting off the granite slab he was shaping. The rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel echoed through the cramped space, punctuated by the occasional grunt of effort as Elias wrestled the unforgiving stone into submission.

Each stroke of his chisel was infused with years of experience and an almost reverent understanding of the material. Stone wasn't just something to be hewn and shaped; it was alive with stories waiting to be unveiled.

But today, Elias couldn't quite focus on the task at hand. A restlessness gnawed at him, a feeling that went beyond the usual ache in his aging joints. Something whispered on the wind, a faint tremor of unease that prickled the back of his neck.
