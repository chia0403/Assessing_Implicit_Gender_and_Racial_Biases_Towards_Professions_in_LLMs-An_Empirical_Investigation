The wind whipped across the sun-baked plains, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and dust. Above, the unforgiving Wyoming sky blazed an angry cerulean, promising another scorcher of a day. Silas Jeremiah Blackwood squinted against the glare, his weathered face etched with years spent under this relentless sun. He adjusted the brim of his Stetson, its once vibrant brown now faded to a dusty grey, mirroring the parched landscape around him. 

His gaze swept over the vast expanse of his ranch, the rolling hills dotted with hardy scrub and stunted pines. The Blackwood Ranch had been in his family for generations, passed down from father to son like a precious heirloom. Silas knew every inch of this land, its hidden springs and treacherous gullies, the temperament of each head of cattle he grazed. Today, however, a shadow of unease hung over him, heavier than the summer heat.  His prize stallion, Comet, had vanished without a trace during the night.
