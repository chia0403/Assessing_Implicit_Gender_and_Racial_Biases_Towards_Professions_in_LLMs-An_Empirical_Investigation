Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Finch's office, blurring the already dim cityscape beyond. The flickering neon sign of the pawn shop across the street cast an anemic glow on his cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of dusty files and a half-eaten tuna sandwich congealing beside a lukewarm mug of coffee. 

Elias Finch wasn't your typical Wall Street lawyer. He operated out of a cramped office above a laundromat in a forgotten corner of Brooklyn, far from the gleaming towers of Manhattan. His clients weren't CEOs or celebrities; they were everyday people grappling with evictions, custody battles, and unpaid debts - the kind who couldn't afford a fancy firm but desperately needed someone to fight for them.

Today, however, Elias was facing a case unlike any he'd seen before. A woman named Evelyn Thorne had walked into his office earlier that day, her eyes wide with fear and her voice trembling as she spoke of a conspiracy so bizarre it seemed ripped from the pages of a thriller novel.
