Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Hawthorne's cozy office, blurring the view of the cobblestone street below. The aroma of Earl Grey tea hung in the air, a comforting counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Amelia sighed, pushing away a stack of brochures advertising sun-drenched beaches and crystal-clear waters â€“ destinations that felt miles away from her dreary London reality.

It was supposed to be peak season for travel agents, but instead, Amelia's phone remained stubbornly silent. Bookings were down, cancellations up. Even the lure of exotic locales couldn't compete with the uncertainty gripping the world. 

Suddenly, a sharp rapping on the door startled her. She straightened her cardigan, hoping it wasn't another desperate couple canceling their honeymoon due to "unforeseen circumstances."  Taking a deep breath, Amelia called out, "Come in!" The door creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadow and rain. 

A shiver ran down Amelia's spine as the stranger stepped into the warm glow of her office. He was tall and lean, with piercing blue eyes hidden beneath the brim of a worn fedora. A single suitcase lay at his feet, its leather scratched and battered.  Amelia felt a strange tingling sensation, as though something extraordinary was about to unfold.

"Ms. Hawthorne?" the stranger's voice was low and gravelly, tinged with an accent she couldn't quite place. "I believe you can help me."
