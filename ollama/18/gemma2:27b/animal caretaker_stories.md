Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the barn, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of sound. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne huddled deeper into her threadbare cardigan, the damp chill seeping through even her thick woolen socks. The air hung heavy with the mingled scents of hay, manure, and wet dog fur. Amy sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her eyes. It was nights like this that she questioned her sanity for choosing to be an animal caretaker at Willow Creek Sanctuary. 

Nestled in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains, Willow Creek was a haven for abandoned, abused, and neglected animals. Amy had poured her heart and soul into rescuing creatures great and small â€“ from scrawny kittens with matted fur to majestic horses bearing the scars of neglect. But tonight, with the wind howling like a banshee and the rain showing no signs of letting up, she felt an ache in her chest deeper than usual.
