The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting an unsettling green glow over the rain-slicked pavement. "Shear Perfection" it proclaimed in bold, bubbly letters, the 'P' in 'Perfection' sputtering on and off like a faulty synapse. Inside, Emilia Rose Davenport meticulously sharpened her shears, their gleam reflecting the worried furrow in her brow. Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the streetlights into hazy halos. It was Tuesday night, past nine, and Emilia should have been locking up hours ago. 

But tonight, a sense of dread clung to her like the lingering scent of hairspray. Her phone buzzed on the counter, displaying a message from her landlord: "Rent overdue. Need payment by Friday."  Emilia sighed, the weight of responsibility settling heavy in her chest. She loved Shear Perfection, her little haven nestled in the heart of Willow Creek, but lately, it felt more like a burden than a dream come true.
