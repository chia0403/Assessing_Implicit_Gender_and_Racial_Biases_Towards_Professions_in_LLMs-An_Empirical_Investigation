The flickering fluorescent lights of H&R Block hummed a tired tune above Eleanor Ainsworth's head. Stacks of W-2s and 1099s teetered precariously on her desk, threatening to avalanche into the sea of crumpled receipts already engulfing her workspace. Tax season was in full swing, and Eleanor, with her trusty calculator and encyclopedic knowledge of tax codes, was at the epicenter of the storm.

Outside, the spring rain drummed a melancholy rhythm against the windowpane, mirroring the dull ache building in Eleanor's shoulders. Another day, another dozen clients wrestling with deductions and dependents, all hoping for a magical refund to ease their financial woes. 


Eleanor sighed, picking up a crumpled form labeled "Schedule C: Profit or Loss From Business." It was always the small businesses that tugged at her heartstrings - the struggling bakery owner, the aspiring musician trying to make ends meet, the single mother juggling multiple jobs. Their stories, hidden within the numbers, were what kept Eleanor coming back year after year, despite the endless paperwork and caffeine-fueled nights.
