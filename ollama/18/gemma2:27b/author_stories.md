Rain lashed against the attic window, mirroring the storm brewing inside Elara Blackwood's chest. She hunched over her antique writing desk, the wood smooth and worn from years of stories poured onto its surface.  Stacks of half-written manuscripts littered the space around her, each page a testament to her writer's block.  

The attic of her grandmother’s Victorian house in coastal Maine wasn’t exactly conducive to creativity. The smell of salt air and mildew hung heavy, punctuated by the mournful cry of gulls outside. Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the grime-coated windowpane, casting elongated shadows that seemed to mock her inability to string together a coherent sentence.

Elara chewed on the end of her pen, staring blankly at the blinking cursor on her laptop screen. Her deadline loomed, an ominous specter threatening to consume her.  The publisher was expecting a captivating gothic romance, but all Elara could conjure were clichés and tired tropes.
