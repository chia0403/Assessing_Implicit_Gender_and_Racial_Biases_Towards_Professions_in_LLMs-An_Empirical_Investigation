Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Pierce's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her own chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn armchair across from her desk, where ten-year-old Liam sat hunched over his knees. His normally bright eyes were downcast, shadowed by a mop of unruly brown hair. Liam was Evelyn's newest case, a quiet boy who had suddenly withdrawn from his classmates and refused to speak in class.

Evelyn's small office nestled in the corner of Willow Creek Elementary School, a building that smelled perpetually of stale crayons and disinfectant. Posters with inspirational quotes about kindness and perseverance adorned the walls, clashing with the heavy atmosphere that seemed to have settled upon them both. Liam fidgeted, twisting a loose thread on his worn jeans. Evelyn, her heart aching for this lost child, knew she had her work cut out for her.
