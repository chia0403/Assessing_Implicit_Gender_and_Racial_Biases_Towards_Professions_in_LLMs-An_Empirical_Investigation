The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he wrestled a stubborn roll of roofing felt onto the steep incline of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian home. Sweat stung his eyes, making the already dizzying view blur even further. Below him, the manicured lawns and picket fences of Oakhaven shimmered like a toy village. It was a picturesque setting, but Eli had little time for admiring it.

The rhythmic hammering of his partner, Jake, echoed from behind, punctuated by the occasional grunt as he wrestled with a bundle of shingles. A hawk screeched overhead, circling lazily in the cloudless sky. The air hummed with the buzz of cicadas and the distant rumble of traffic on Elm Street. It was another scorching summer day in Oakhaven, a town Eli had called home for his entire 32 years.

Eli sighed, shifting his weight carefully to avoid sliding down the roof. He loved the physical challenge of roofing â€“ the feeling of accomplishment that came with transforming a dilapidated structure into something solid and weatherproof. But today, he couldn't shake the nagging sense of unease that had been plaguing him since sunrise. It started as a vague whisper in his mind, a prickling sensation on the back of his neck. Now, it felt like a full-blown storm brewing inside him, threatening to break loose.
