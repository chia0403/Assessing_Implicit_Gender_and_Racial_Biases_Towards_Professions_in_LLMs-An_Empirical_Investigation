The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Montgomery's head as she meticulously polished a patient's molars, her brow furrowed in concentration. The scent of mint toothpaste mingled with the faint metallic tang of blood – a familiar and comforting aroma in her world. Outside the window, rain lashed against the glass pane, blurring the already gray cityscape into an impressionistic watercolor. It was just another Tuesday at Smiles Dental Clinic, tucked away on a quiet side street in downtown Seattle. 

Elara, with her gentle touch and calming demeanor, was beloved by patients young and old. But today, a strange unease settled over her. It wasn't the usual pre-lunch slump or the dreary weather weighing on her spirits. Something felt…off.
