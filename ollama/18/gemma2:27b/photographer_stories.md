Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Finch's attic studio, blurring the cityscape beyond into an Impressionist watercolour. The rhythmic drumming echoed the frantic beat of Elias's heart as he hunched over his workbench, tools scattered like fallen leaves around him. His latest project, a series documenting the abandoned industrial zones on the outskirts of the city, lay in ruins - literally. The lens of his prized vintage Rolleiflex, a gift from his grandfather, had cracked clean through, rendering it useless.

Elias ran a shaking hand through his damp, unruly hair. Despair threatened to swallow him whole. This project was everything - a chance to break free from the mundane commercial shoots he'd been relegated to, a way to capture the haunting beauty of decay and rebirth he saw in these forgotten spaces. Without that lens, it all felt hopeless.
