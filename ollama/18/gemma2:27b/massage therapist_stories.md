Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Serenity Now," a tiny storefront nestled between a noisy laundromat and a perpetually closed bakery. Amelia Grace Hawthorne sighed as she watched the water streak down the glass, blurring the neon sign across the street that advertised "Hot Wings & Cold Beer." It wasn't exactly the serene ambiance she'd envisioned when she opened her massage therapy business three months ago.

But Serenity Now was Amelia's dream come true, a sanctuary she built from the ground up after years of working in sterile, corporate spas. She loved the intimacy of her small space, the calming lavender scent that permeated every corner, and the gentle tinkling wind chimes that hung by the door. Today, though, even the soothing ambiance couldn't quite lift Amelia's spirits. 


A single client had cancelled this morning due to a nasty cold, leaving Amelia staring at an empty schedule for the rest of the day. As she contemplated brewing another pot of chamomile tea (her third today), the bell above the door chimed, announcing an unexpected arrival.
