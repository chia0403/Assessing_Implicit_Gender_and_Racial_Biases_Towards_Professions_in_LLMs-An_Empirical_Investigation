The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow onto Dr. Eleanor Vance's tired face as she wrestled with the stubborn lock on her office door. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the streetlights into shimmering halos. The only sound besides the relentless downpour was the distant wail of a siren, adding to the already grim atmosphere.

Eleanor sighed, finally managing to coax the door open. Her dental practice, nestled in the heart of a quiet suburban neighborhood, usually pulsed with life at this hour, children giggling over cartoon posters while parents nervously awaited their turn. Tonight, however, it was eerily silent. The storm had kept everyone away, leaving Eleanor alone with the ghost of laughter that still lingered in the air.

She flipped on the light switch, illuminating a space filled with gleaming stainless steel instruments and colorful murals depicting smiling teeth. A faint scent of antiseptic hung heavy, mingling with the dampness seeping in from the rain. 


As Eleanor prepared for what promised to be another late night catching up on paperwork, a sharp rapping at the window startled her.  She turned, her heart pounding, to see a figure silhouetted against the storm-tossed night.
