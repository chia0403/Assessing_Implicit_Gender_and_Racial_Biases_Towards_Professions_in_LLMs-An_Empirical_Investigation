Rain hammered against the pharmacy window, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign into a watercolor smear. Inside, Eloise Davenport meticulously counted out twenty-five bright orange tablets, her brow furrowed in concentration despite the familiar routine. The bell above the door chimed, startling her. A figure, cloaked in shadow and dripping with rain, hurried inside. Eloise straightened, plastering on her professional smile even as a shiver ran down her spine. Something about the strangerâ€™s silhouette - hunched and rushed, obscured by a wide-brimmed hat - made her uneasy.  

The small town pharmacy was usually quiet at this hour, the only sounds the gentle hum of the refrigerator and Eloise's own rhythmic tapping as she counted pills. This late arrival, however, disrupted the peaceful rhythm, injecting a dose of tension into the air thick with the scent of antiseptic and lavender.
