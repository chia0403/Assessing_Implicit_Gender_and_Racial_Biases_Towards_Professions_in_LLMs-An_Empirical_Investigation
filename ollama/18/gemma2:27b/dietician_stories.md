Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Evelyn Rose Blackwood's office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart.  Her small but inviting space, tucked away on the second floor of an old Victorian building overlooking a cobblestone street in Edinburgh, felt suddenly claustrophobic. Outside, the city was shrouded in a grey mist, reflecting Evelyn's own turbulent emotions.

She wasn't supposed to be this nervous. After years of studying nutrition and working diligently as a dietician at the local hospital, she'd finally taken the leap and opened her private practice. Today was her first client consultation. But instead of excitement, all Evelyn felt was a gnawing dread. What if her advice wasn't good enough? What if she couldn't help this person reclaim their health?


What happens next?
