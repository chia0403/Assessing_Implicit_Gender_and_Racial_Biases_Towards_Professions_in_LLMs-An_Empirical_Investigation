Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound. The air hung thick with humidity, smelling faintly of kerosene and antiseptic. Eloise Anya Ramirez, her brow furrowed beneath a damp bandana, wrestled with a stubborn IV line.  

The small clinic in San Miguel de Allende, nestled amongst cobblestone streets and vibrant colonial architecture, was a world away from the sterile hospitals she'd trained in. Here, resources were scarce, electricity unreliable, and patients arrived with ailments both common and curious. Eloise had come seeking adventure and purpose, but the weight of responsibility pressed upon her like the oppressive humidity. 

Today, it felt heavier than usual. A young boy lay pale and feverish on the cot, his small chest struggling for breath. His grandmother, Maria, watched with eyes filled with a mixture of hope and fear. Eloise knew she had to act quickly, but doubt gnawed at her.  She hadn't encountered anything quite like this before, and the nearest hospital was hours away, reachable only by a treacherous mountain road slick with rain.
