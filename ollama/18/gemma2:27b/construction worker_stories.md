The midday sun beat down on Elias “Eli” Thorne’s neck, drawing beads of sweat that trickled down his weathered face and into the collar of his dusty work shirt.  The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of diesel fuel, sawdust, and something faintly metallic – the unmistakable aroma of a skyscraper being born. Eli stood precariously on a steel beam, high above the teeming streets of Chicago, surveying the dizzying expanse of concrete and girders that stretched out before him.  His calloused hands gripped the edge of the beam, knuckles white against the cold metal. He squinted down at the miniature figures bustling below – ants in a concrete labyrinth.

This was Eli’s world: a symphony of clanging steel, roaring engines, and shouted instructions. The city stretched out like a vast tapestry woven from dreams and ambition, and Eli, with his calloused hands and unwavering determination, was helping to weave its next chapter. Today, however, something felt different. A restlessness thrummed beneath his skin, an itch he couldn't scratch. He wasn't sure if it was the relentless heat, the unnerving height, or something else entirely, but a sense of foreboding had crept over him like a shadow. 

The foreman’s bellow snapped Eli back to attention. "Thorne! You got that last beam secured?" 


Eli nodded, his gaze returning to the dizzying drop below. He knew he shouldn't be distracted. This was dangerous work, demanding focus and precision. Yet, the unease persisted, whispering warnings in the wind.
