The humid Charleston air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and salt as Eliza Annelise Moreau dipped her brush into a pool of cerulean blue. Her studio, a converted carriage house nestled behind a sprawling antebellum mansion on Rainbow Row, was bathed in the golden glow of late afternoon sun. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. Eliza paused, her gaze drawn to the canvas before her: a vibrant landscape depicting the marsh grasses swaying in the breeze, their emerald blades reflecting the fiery hues of the setting sun.  She longed to capture the ephemeral beauty of the moment, the way the light played upon the water, transforming the ordinary into something magical. But today, inspiration seemed elusive, replaced by a gnawing unease that settled deep within her chest.

Eliza wasn't sure what it was – perhaps the oppressive heat, or the unsettling dream she had that morning – but something felt amiss. The vibrant colors on her palette seemed dull, the brushstrokes hesitant and unsure. As she stared at the unfinished canvas, a shiver ran down her spine. A faint rustling sound from outside the studio window startled her. Eliza whipped around, her heart pounding, expecting to see a stray cat or perhaps a curious raccoon. But there was nothing there. Only the gentle sway of the palmetto trees and the distant cries of seagulls. Still, the feeling of being watched persisted, a cold dread creeping into her bones like the tendrils of a strangling vine.
