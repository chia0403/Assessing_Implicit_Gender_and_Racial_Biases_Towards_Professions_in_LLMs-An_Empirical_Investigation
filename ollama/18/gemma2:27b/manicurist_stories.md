The neon sign outside flickered "Nails by Natalia" in a sickly shade of green, casting an unsettling glow across the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, Natalia Petrova meticulously buffed a client's nails, her practiced movements as smooth and precise as a surgeon's. The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender polish, a peculiar perfume that Natalia had come to associate with both solace and anxiety.

Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Natalia. Her usually vibrant violet streaks were dulled, hidden beneath a plain black beanie. Her eyes, normally sparkling like polished gemstones, held a distant, haunted look. Today was her grandmother's birthday, a day Natalia had always dreaded since Baba's passing two years ago. Memories of Baba's warm smile and the comforting scent of borscht flickered through Natalia's mind, leaving behind a bittersweet ache.  


She knew she should be celebrating, remembering the woman who taught her everything she knew about life, love, and the intricate art of nail artistry. But instead, Natalia felt an overwhelming sense of loneliness, a void that even the steady rhythm of filing nails couldn't fill.
