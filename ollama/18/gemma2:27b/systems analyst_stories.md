Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Elias Finch's cramped apartment, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The flickering neon sign from the Chinese takeout joint across the street cast grotesque shadows that danced along the peeling wallpaper. Elias, a gaunt man with perpetually tired eyes magnified by thick-rimmed glasses, ran a hand through his already dishevelled hair.

He'd been staring at the same line of code for hours, the cursor blinking accusingly like a judgemental eye. The system he was tasked with analyzing - a sprawling behemoth responsible for managing the city's power grid - was throwing up anomalies he couldn't decipher. Something wasn't right, something felt deliberately obfuscated. Elias had a nagging suspicion this wasn't just a bug; it was a carefully constructed trap. 

The deadline loomed, a hungry beast demanding its due. But Elias couldn't shake the feeling that unraveling this code might expose something far more dangerous than a simple technical glitch. He glanced at the overflowing takeout containers littering his desk, a testament to the countless sleepless nights he'd spent wrestling with this enigma. Tonight, though, hunger was overshadowed by fear. Fear of what he might find, and who might be looking for him if he did.
