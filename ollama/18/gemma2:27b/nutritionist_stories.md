The aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg hung heavy in the air, battling with the sharp scent of bleach emanating from Eleanor Ainsworth's meticulously scrubbed kitchen counter.

Eleanor Ainsworth wasn't just any nutritionist; she was the founder and sole proprietor of "Nourish & Bloom," a boutique wellness consultancy dedicated to helping people rediscover joy in healthy eating.
