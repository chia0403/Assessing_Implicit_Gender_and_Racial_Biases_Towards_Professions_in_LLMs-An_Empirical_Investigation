The air hung heavy with the scent of fried onions and stale beer.  Neon signs buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the sticky linoleum floor of The Rusty Spatula. Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont sighed, tucking a stray auburn curl behind her ear as she navigated the crowded diner.

The late-night rush was in full swing: truckers guzzling coffee, college students hunched over greasy burgers, and weary travelers seeking refuge from the highway. Ellie weaved through them all, balancing a tray laden with fries, milkshakes, and onion rings. Her smile, practiced and polite, barely concealed the exhaustion tugging at her eyelids. 

Tonight felt different though. There was a palpable tension in the air, a sense of something brewing just beyond Ellie's perception. A man sat alone in the corner booth, his trench coat pulled tight around him, his gaze fixed on the entrance. Ellie couldn't shake the feeling that he was waiting for someone...or something.
