The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the clinic, each drop an insistent drumbeat echoing through the sparsely furnished room. Eliza Grace Hawthorne sighed, pushing aside the damp strands of hair that had escaped her braid. The power flickered again, casting dancing shadows across the faded floral wallpaper. A familiar frustration bubbled in her chest.

This weather always seemed to coincide with the arrival of her most challenging patients - those who needed her expertise the most but were often hesitant to embrace it. Today's patient was no exception. He was a burly fisherman, Elias "Bear" McTavish, whose calloused hands and weathered face spoke volumes about a life spent battling the unforgiving sea. He sat across from Eliza, his massive frame hunched in on itself, his gaze fixed stubbornly on the floor. His knee injury, a vicious tear sustained during a rogue wave, was evident in the way he winced with every shift in position.

Eliza knew Bear wasn't just battling physical pain; he was wrestling with the fear of being sidelined, of losing his livelihood to an unforgiving injury. She needed to build trust, not just heal a torn ligament.  The clinic, perched on the edge of the rugged Scottish coastline, felt like a fragile haven against the storm raging outside. It was Eliza's sanctuary, a place where she sought to mend broken bodies and, often, fractured spirits. 

But today, even Eliza wondered if her skills were enough to weather this particular storm.
