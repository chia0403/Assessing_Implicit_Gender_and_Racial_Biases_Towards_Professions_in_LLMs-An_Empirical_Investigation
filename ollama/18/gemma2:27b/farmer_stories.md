The wind whipped across Ezra Bartholomew's weathered face, carrying with it the scent of rain-soaked earth and distant thunder. He squinted at the horizon, where bruised clouds churned like a cauldron, threatening to unleash their fury upon his meager fields.  Ezra tugged his threadbare hat lower, shielding his eyes from the stinging gusts. His calloused hands, gnarled from years of toil, gripped the handle of his rusted pitchfork tighter.

He stood at the edge of his patchwork farm, a lonely expanse nestled between rolling hills and a dense, brooding forest. The once vibrant green of his cornstalks had faded to a dull yellow under the oppressive sky, mirroring the gnawing anxiety in Ezra's gut. This yearâ€™s harvest promised to be meager, barely enough to sustain him and his aging mother through the coming winter.

A flash of lightning split the heavens, illuminating the desolate landscape for a fleeting moment.  The distant rumble deepened into a rolling growl, signaling the storm's imminent arrival. Ezra sighed, knowing there was little he could do but brace himself for its wrath.
