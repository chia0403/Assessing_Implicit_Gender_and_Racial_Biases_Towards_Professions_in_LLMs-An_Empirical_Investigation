The scent of sawdust hung thick in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of linseed oil. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windowpanes of Silas Blackwood's workshop, illuminating motes dancing in its path. The rhythmic rasp of his plane against oak filled the otherwise silent space â€“ a comforting cadence Silas had known since he was a boy, perched on a stool beside his grandfather, learning the ancient craft. 

Today, however, the familiar rhythm was tinged with unease. A commission lay before him: a cradle, intricately carved, for the newborn child of Lord Alistair Blackwood, a distant but powerful relative Silas had never met. The wood, a rare and beautiful rosewood, pulsed beneath his calloused fingers, whispering promises of enduring beauty. Yet, Silas couldn't shake the unsettling feeling that this commission was more than just another job. He sensed an undercurrent of expectation, a weight of destiny he hadn't encountered before.
