Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Radcliffe's corner office, blurring the already muted cityscape below. A low growl rumbled in her stomach, reminding her she hadn't eaten since breakfast â€“ a hasty affair consisting of black coffee and two dry biscuits inhaled while reviewing quarterly reports. The clock on the wall ticked mercilessly towards 8 pm, a stark reminder that Amelia was yet again sacrificing dinner for deadlines.

As CEO of Radcliffe Innovations, a tech start-up specializing in sustainable energy solutions, Amelia lived and breathed her work. The pressure to deliver groundbreaking results while navigating a fiercely competitive market weighed heavily on her shoulders. Tonight, however, the tension felt different, sharper. A sense of foreboding lingered in the air, thick as the fog rolling in off the Hudson River.

A sudden ping from her phone shattered the silence. It was an email from her lead engineer, subject line: "Critical issue." Amelia's pulse quickened.  Something was wrong, very wrong.
