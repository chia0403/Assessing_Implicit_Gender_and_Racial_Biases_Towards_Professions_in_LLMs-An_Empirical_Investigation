The rain hammered against the ornate, arched windows of The Grand Blackwood Hotel, mimicking the frantic tattooing Amelia Beaumont's heart made against her ribs. 

She stood ramrod straight behind the polished mahogany desk, her navy blue uniform impeccably pressed and her posture a testament to years of rigorous training in the art of discretion and grace. But beneath the calm facade, a storm raged. Mr. Alistair Cavendish, a notoriously volatile billionaire known for his explosive temper and insatiable demands, was due any minute, fresh from a disastrous business deal that had splashed across the headlines that morning.

Amelia knew she had to be on her toes. One wrong word, one misplaced smile, could send him spiralling into a tirade that would reverberate through the hushed grandeur of the hotel lobby.  The Grand Blackwood was renowned for its opulent suites, world-class dining, and unwavering commitment to guest satisfaction. But even The Grand Blackwood had never encountered a storm quite like Alistair Cavendish. 

Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the inevitable encounter. Outside, lightning cracked, illuminating the city in an eerie flash. The clock on the wall ticked ominously towards six o'clock â€“ Mr. Cavendish's scheduled arrival time.
