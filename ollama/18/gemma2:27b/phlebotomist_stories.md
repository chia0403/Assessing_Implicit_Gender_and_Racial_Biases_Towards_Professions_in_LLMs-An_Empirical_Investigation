The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Cartwright's head, casting a sterile glow over the bustling waiting room. The scent of disinfectant mingled with nervous sweat and cheap perfume, creating a unique olfactory cocktail that Amelia had come to associate with her job.  She adjusted the strap of her navy blue uniform, its embroidered "Mercy Hospital" logo catching the light as she moved. Her name tag, pinned just below it, announced her to the world: "Amelia R. Cartwright, Phlebotomist."

It was a Tuesday morning, and like clockwork, the room was packed with people clutching crumpled paperwork, nervously tapping their feet, or staring vacantly at the peeling paint on the walls. Amelia sighed. This wasn't exactly glamorous work, but someone had to do it. 


Today's schedule promised an unusual mix of patients: a giggling toddler needing a blood glucose test, a stoic businessman with a vein that threatened to vanish altogether, and a frail elderly woman who was convinced Amelia was there to steal her soul. 

Taking a deep breath, Amelia squared her shoulders and prepared for another day in the trenches of Mercy Hospital's lab.  The beep of the intercom signaled the arrival of her first patient. "Amelia Rose Cartwright," the voice crackled, "Room 3."
