The rusty clang of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' toolbox echoed through the narrow alleyway, punctuated by the insistent drip-drip-drip from a leaky pipe overhead.  Above him, a grimy fire escape groaned under the weight of overflowing garbage bags and pigeon droppings. The stench of stale beer and something vaguely floral hung heavy in the humid New York air. Bart grimaced. This wasn't exactly the glamorous life he'd envisioned when he'd first signed up for plumbing school.

He tightened a bolt on his trusty wrench, squinting at the ancient pipes snaking their way up the brick wall of the dilapidated tenement building. A symphony of groans and gurgles emanated from within, like the disgruntled rumblings of an awakened beast.  This was going to be a fun one.
