The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and beeswax in Bartholomew Quill’s tiny shop. Sunlight, fractured by dusty panes of glass, painted warm stripes across the floorboards, illuminating spools of thread in jewel tones and bolts of velvet so rich they seemed to absorb light itself. Outside, the cobbled streets of Larkhaven bustled with the usual pre-market commotion – bakers hauling loaves, children chasing stray dogs, vendors hawking their wares. But inside Bartholomew's haven, the world was muted, a symphony of soft scissors snipping and the rhythmic hum of his treadle sewing machine.

Bartholomew himself, a man whose age mirrored the wrinkles etched onto his face like delicate embroidery, paused in his work, his needle hovering mid-air above a length of crimson silk. His silver spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of his nose as he squinted at the pattern laid out before him, a frown furrowing his brow. He was crafting a gown for Lady Elara Ashworth, Larkhaven’s most renowned patroness of the arts, and perfection was non-negotiable.

A sudden rapping at the shop door broke Bartholomew's concentration. Sighing, he set down his needle and shuffled towards the entrance, leaving the crimson silk shimmering in the sunlit dust motes.
