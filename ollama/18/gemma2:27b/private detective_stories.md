Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. The scent of stale cigarette smoke and desperation hung heavy in Silas Blackwood's cramped office. Papers overflowed from his desk, a haphazard mosaic of case files, overdue bills, and half-eaten takeout containers.

Silas, a man whose face seemed permanently etched with a weary cynicism, tapped a crooked fingernail against the chipped tabletop.  His trench coat, perpetually damp, hung limply on a hook by the door, its pockets bulging with clues – crumpled photographs, cryptic notes scrawled on napkins, and the occasional bullet casing (always handled with extreme caution). He was known for taking cases others wouldn't touch – the desperate, the downtrodden, the ones who had nowhere else to turn. 

Tonight's visitor, a young woman named Lily Carmichael, sat opposite him, her face pale and drawn beneath the harsh fluorescent light. Her trembling hands clutched a worn photograph of a man Silas didn't recognize.  She looked like a bird caught in a storm, desperate for shelter.


"He just vanished," she whispered, her voice choked with tears. "One day he was there, the next…gone."
