The aroma of burnt toast battled with the sickly-sweet scent of artificial strawberry from the hallway's hand sanitizer dispenser. Ms. Eloise Cartwright grimaced, flipping another slice of bread in her toaster oven – the third attempt this morning.  It was always like this on Mondays. Her tiny apartment felt more like a chaotic obstacle course than a haven before she had to face 25 sugar-fueled seven-year-olds.

Outside, rain hammered against her kitchen window, mirroring the drumming anxiety in Eloise's chest. Today was Ms. Johnson's last day before maternity leave, and Eloise would be taking over her class of rambunctious second graders. Eloise loved teaching, truly she did, but the thought of wrangling a room full of wide-eyed energy while navigating the complexities of multiplication and cursive writing sent a shiver down her spine.

She sighed, slathering butter on the miraculously unburnt toast, and stared out at the grey cityscape. Maybe today wouldn't be so bad. Maybe she could make a difference, inspire those young minds.  Maybe… just maybe… she wouldn't need to hide in the supply closet for a sanity break.
