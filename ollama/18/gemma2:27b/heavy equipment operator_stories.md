The Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's weathered neck as he wrestled the controls of his Caterpillar 336 excavator. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling red against the endless blue sky. Eli squinted, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of a calloused hand.  He maneuvered the massive machine with practiced ease, scooping up mounds of red earth and depositing them into the waiting dump trucks. The rhythmic growl of the engine mingled with the clang of metal on metal, a familiar symphony to Eli's ears. 

This particular site, a sprawling new housing development on the outskirts of Phoenix, was a far cry from the desolate mine shafts he'd spent years digging in Nevada. But Eli didn't mind the change of scenery. He liked seeing things grow instead of disappear. The relentless sun, however, was something he hadn't quite gotten used to. Back in Nevada, at least you could find some shade under a gnarled juniper tree. Here, there was nothing but endless horizon and baking asphalt.

Today felt different, though. A prickling sensation ran down Eli's spine as he maneuvered the excavator into position for another scoop. It wasn't just the heat; there was something else in the air, something unseen but palpable. He shook his head, attributing it to nerves.  He hadn't been back in Arizona since he was a kid, and seeing familiar landmarks – the saguaro cacti silhouetted against the setting sun, the dusty trails winding through the desert – was stirring up old memories. Memories he’d rather keep buried.

Suddenly, the radio crackled to life. "Eli," the foreman's voice boomed through the speaker, "Got a new task for you. Head over to section 7. We found something…"

Eli frowned. Found something? What could they possibly have found in this barren wasteland? Curiosity warred with apprehension as he steered the excavator towards the indicated area. He had a feeling this was no ordinary dig.
