The Nevada sun beat down on the cracked asphalt like a vengeful god. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling reddish-brown against the bleached desert landscape. Elias Blackwood, his face shaded by a battered Stetson, squinted at the ramshackle set before him. It was supposed to be a ghost town, but right now it looked more like an abandoned playground â€“ weathered wooden boards groaning beneath the weight of peeling paint, rusty wagon wheels half-buried in sand, and a crooked sign reading "Welcome to Redemption" swinging precariously from a solitary post.

Elias adjusted his worn leather jacket and sighed. The budget was already tighter than a drumhead, the crew was restless, and the lead actress had flown off the handle this morning, threatening to walk if they didn't find a decent canteen of iced tea.  He needed a miracle. He needed Redemption.
