The fluorescent lights of the community center gymnasium hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Cortez's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the polished wooden floor. Sweat beaded on Esme's forehead as she demonstrated a lunge, her toned muscles rippling beneath her bright turquoise tank top. The air throbbed with the rhythmic thud of sneakers and the wheezing breaths of twenty-something participants attempting to keep up with her high-energy routine. 

But Esme wasn't focused on them. Her eyes were fixed on the clock ticking relentlessly above the mirrored wall, each tick a hammer blow against her anxiety. In ten minutes, the doors would open for the "Advanced Sculpt" class â€“ the one she'd been nervously anticipating all week.  It was her first time teaching this level, and whispers of its intensity had already reached her ears. Esme hoped she wouldn't disappoint them, or herself.

The gymnasium echoed with the echoing clang as the last participant stumbled through their final rep.  Esme clapped enthusiastically, a forced smile plastered on her face. "Great job everyone! Now, grab some water and we'll see you all next week!"


As the students filed out, Esme grabbed her towel and wiped her brow, her heart pounding in her chest like a trapped bird. Ten minutes until the real test began.
