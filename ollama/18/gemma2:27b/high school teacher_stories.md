Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Winthrop's English classroom, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Papers lay scattered across her desk – essays marked with red ink, each grade a stinging reminder of her students’ apathy. She sighed, rubbing her temples as the scent of old books and stale coffee filled the air, a familiar comfort in this increasingly chaotic world.  

The bell announcing the start of fifth period clanged through the halls of Westbridge High, a sound that usually brought a flicker of anticipation to Eleanor's heart. Today, it felt like the clang of a prison door slamming shut.  She was tired – bone-tired of trying to ignite passion for literature in teenagers more interested in TikToks and Instagram than the words of Shakespeare or Austen.  Eleanor glanced at her reflection in the windowpane, her usually vibrant hazel eyes dulled with exhaustion.

Could she do this anymore? Could she continue fighting a losing battle against indifference?
