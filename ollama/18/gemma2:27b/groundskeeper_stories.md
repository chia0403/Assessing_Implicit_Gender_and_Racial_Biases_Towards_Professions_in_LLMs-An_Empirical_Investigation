The rusted gates groaned like an old man complaining about the weather as Alistair Bartholomew Finch pushed them open. Dawn was just breaking over Wyvernwood Estate, painting the sky in soft hues of lavender and rose. Dew clung to the emerald grass, sparkling like a thousand tiny diamonds under the pale light.

Alistair, with his weathered face and hands permanently stained green from years of nurturing the earth, surveyed his domain. Wyvernwood, once a vibrant tapestry of meticulously manicured gardens and ancient woodlands, was now cloaked in a melancholic stillness. The grand manor house loomed ahead, its windows dark and lifeless, like empty eyes staring out at the world. 

Alistair sighed, the weight of responsibility settling on his shoulders. He was the last vestige of Wyvernwood's former glory, entrusted with the care of its grounds even as the mansion stood abandoned, a monument to forgotten wealth and faded dreams.
