The air hung thick with diesel fumes and the promise of rain as Ezekiel "Zeke" Blackwood wrestled his eighteen-wheeler into the dusty truck stop lot. Neon signs flickered to life, casting lurid shadows across the asphalt jungle of rigs and trailers. A chorus of idling engines hummed a tired symphony, punctuated by the occasional clang of a trailer door or the guttural cough of a rusty air brake. Zeke's rig, "Big Bertha," a weathered Kenworth W900 with more miles than most states have roads, groaned in protest as he eased her into a vacant spot near the back. 

He was bone-tired, his muscles aching from hours spent gripping the wheel and fighting against the relentless pull of the open road. His coffee had long gone cold, replaced by a gnawing emptiness in his stomach that even a greasy diner burger couldn't fully satiate. Zeke needed rest. He needed sleep. But most of all, he needed to figure out how he was going to make up for this lost time and still deliver his load on schedule.
