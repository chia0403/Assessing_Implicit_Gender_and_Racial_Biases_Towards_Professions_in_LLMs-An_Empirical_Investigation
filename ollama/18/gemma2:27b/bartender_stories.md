Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Gilded Cage, blurring the neon "Open" sign into a hazy smear. Inside, Bartholomew "Bart" Finnegan polished a chipped highball glass with practiced precision, the rhythmic squeak a counterpoint to the mournful saxophone melody drifting from the dusty jukebox in the corner. 

The air hung heavy with the mingled scents of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and desperation. Bart had seen it all in his twenty years behind this mahogany bar: heartbreak, joy, drunken confessions, and whispered dreams. Tonight, however, felt different. There was a prickle of unease beneath his skin, an itch he couldn't scratch. Maybe it was the storm, or maybe it was the lone figure hunched at the far end of the bar, shrouded in shadow and sipping something dark and potent.
