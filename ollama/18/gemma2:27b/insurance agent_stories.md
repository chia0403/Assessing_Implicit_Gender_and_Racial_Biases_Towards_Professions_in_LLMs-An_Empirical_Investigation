Rain lashed against the windows of Theodore Bartholomew "Teddy" Finch's office, mimicking the incessant drumming in his chest.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over stacks of policy documents and dusty figurines of grinning bobblehead insurance agents – grim reminders of Teddy’s dwindling success rate. His tiny corner office on the third floor of a dilapidated office building overlooked the desolate stretch of Elm Street, where cracked sidewalks mirrored the fractured state of his own career.  He'd once been a rising star in Finch & Sons Insurance, but now, with the insurance market saturated and competition fierce, Teddy found himself struggling to make ends meet. 

Today was crucial. A potential client, Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne, a wealthy widow known for her eccentricities and rumored collection of priceless artifacts, had agreed to meet him. If he could secure her business, it would be the lifeline his career desperately needed.  But as the clock ticked relentlessly towards their appointed hour, Teddy's anxiety mounted. He knew Mrs. Hawthorne was notorious for being difficult to impress, and a single misstep could cost him dearly.
