The air hung thick with the scent of oil, gasoline, and desperation. Grease smudged Amelia "Millie" Harper's already dirt-streaked forehead as she hunched over a sputtering '67 Mustang engine.  

Millie's Auto Repair wasn't your typical roadside garage. Nestled in a forgotten corner of Havenwood, Oregon - a town clinging precariously to the edge of the Pacific Northwest wilderness - it was more of a ramshackle oasis for beat-up classics and broken dreams. Millie's weathered hands, calloused from years of wrestling with engines, knew these cars like old friends. Their groans, whirs, and coughs were her language, each one telling a story of neglect, adventure, or simple wear and tear. 

Today, the story belonged to the Mustang, its once-proud crimson paint dulled by time and countless fender benders. A young man with wide, anxious eyes paced nervously beside it. He was desperate to get this car running - his father's legacy, he'd said, a symbol of their shared dreams. Millie knew that feeling.  Dreams often came coated in rust and grease, needing a little love and ingenuity to get them back on the road. 


This wasn't just another repair job for Millie. It was a chance to mend not only the engine but perhaps also a small piece of the young man's shattered hope.
