The rusty chrome gleamed under the hazy Nevada sun as Earl "Thunderbolt" Thompson squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him. The air was thick with the smell of diesel and dust, punctuated by the occasional mournful cry of a hawk circling high above. 

His eighteen-wheeler, affectionately nicknamed 'Betsy', rumbled to life, its engine a guttural growl that echoed across the desolate landscape. Earl adjusted his trucker cap, revealing a face weathered by years on the road – tanned, lined, and holding the weary wisdom of miles traversed.  He flipped on the CB radio, hoping for a bit of chatter, but only static answered him.

The Mojave Desert stretched out like an unforgiving canvas, painted in shades of ochre and gold. The bleached bones of Joshua trees stood sentinel against the relentless sun, their branches reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. This stretch between Las Vegas and Phoenix was Earl's bread and butter – a lonely journey he knew by heart, every bend and stop sign a familiar friend. 

But today felt different. A prickling unease settled in his gut, a feeling he couldn't shake. It started with the unsettling silence on the CB – no other truckers, no gossip, no friendly warnings. Then came the shadows that seemed to dance at the edge of his vision, too quick and fleeting to be real.

Earl gripped the steering wheel tighter, pushing down on the accelerator as Betsy surged forward. He needed to reach Phoenix before nightfall.
