The scent of stale coffee and desperation clung to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin.  Amelia wasn't sure which was worse – the perpetually lukewarm brew or the mountain of invoices demanding her attention before Mr. Davenport’s infamous “fire drill” meeting at 9:00 am sharp.

She could practically hear the faint ticking of every second slipping away, each one another tick closer to chaos. Her fingers flew across the keyboard, a desperate ballet of productivity punctuated by the occasional frantic sigh. This wasn’t how Amelia envisioned her day starting.  This wasn't how she envisioned any day at Davenport & Sons Enterprises.
