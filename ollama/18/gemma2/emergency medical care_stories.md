The sirens screamed their mournful song, cutting through the humid night air like a serrated knife. Rain slicked the asphalt, turning the city streets into treacherous ribbons reflecting the flashing red and blue lights.  

Inside Ambulance 47, Amelia Beatrice Flores, better known as Amy to her colleagues, gripped the steering wheel with white knuckles. Her brow was furrowed in concentration, eyes scanning the rain-lashed windshield as she navigated the labyrinthine back alleys of downtown Chicago. The call had come in just minutes ago: a possible cardiac arrest, young male, unknown circumstances.

Amy's pulse hammered in her ears, keeping time with the frantic whine of the siren. This was the kind of call that could turn on a dime, the kind where seconds felt like eternities and every decision mattered.  She stole a glance at Ben, her partner, his face illuminated by the flickering light from the control panel. He was prepping their equipment, his movements efficient and practiced, a calm anchor in the storm brewing around them.

Reaching the designated location, Amy slammed on the brakes, sending a spray of water across the pavement. The scene unfolded before them: a dimly lit alleyway, shrouded in mist and smelling of stale beer. A young man lay slumped against a dumpster, his chest barely rising and falling with each shallow breath.  


This was it. This was where Amy's years of training would be tested. This was where she made a difference.
