The air hung thick with the sterile scent of peppermint and antiseptic. Sunlight sliced through the blinds, casting stripes across the worn linoleum floor of Dr. Feldman's office. Amelia "Amy" Rosewater meticulously counted the suction tips, her movements practiced and precise after fifteen years as a dental hygienist. She hummed softly, the familiar melody a comforting counterpoint to the rhythmic whirring of the sterilizer in the corner. 

Today was different, though. A prickle of unease danced beneath Amy's usually calm exterior. The office felt strangely quiet - no chatter from the receptionist, no nervous coughs from patients in the waiting room. Even Dr. Feldman, a whirlwind of chaotic energy most mornings, seemed absent. He'd left a note on her station: "Gone for unexpected emergency. Be sure to lock up." 

Amy frowned, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. An unexpectant emergency? What could it be? This wasn't like Dr. Feldman, who usually announced his comings and goings with the fanfare of a marching band. Something felt off, a discordant note in the usual symphony of the dental office.
