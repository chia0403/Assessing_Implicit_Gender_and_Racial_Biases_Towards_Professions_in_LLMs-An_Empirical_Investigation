The sterile scent of disinfectant clung to Evelyn Grace Hawthorne like a second skin.  She surveyed her domain: the dimly lit OT gym at Mercy Hospital, where sunlight struggled to penetrate through the grimy windows. Wobbly exercise bikes lined one wall, their seats stained with the sweat and dreams of recovering patients.  A tangle of resistance bands lay in a corner, next to a battered set of weights that groaned under their own rust. Evelyn ran a hand over the worn, vinyl surface of a physio ball, imagining the countless bodies it had supported, healed, or at least attempted to help along their path back to normalcy.

Today was like any other: a whirlwind of appointments, assessments, and exercises designed to coax functionality from broken limbs and weary minds.  But Evelyn felt a prickle of anticipation beneath the familiar routine. A new patient, a young musician named Liam Taylor, had been admitted following a serious car accident that left him with limited use of his right arm. His music was all he had, and Evelyn knew this wasn't just about regaining function; it was about reclaiming a part of himself.   

The door creaked open, bringing in the scent of rain and Liam Taylor himself, a shadow of the vibrant young man she'd read about in his file.
