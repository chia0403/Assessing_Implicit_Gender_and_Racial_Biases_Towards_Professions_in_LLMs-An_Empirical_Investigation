The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Blackwood's head like a swarm of angry bees, casting a sterile glow on the linoleum floor that gleamed underfoot. A symphony of beeps, whirs, and hushed voices filled the air of the cardiac intensive care unit at Mercy General Hospital. Amelia leaned against the stainless steel railing, her gaze fixed on the tangle of tubes and wires snaking from the chest of Patient 74, a man she knew only as John. His monitor blinked with a frantic rhythm, each beep a hammer blow against the fragile shell of his life.  It was 3:12 AM, the witching hour, when every groan and gurgle felt amplified in the hushed silence between the nurses' quick whispers and the distant clatter of the hospital coffee machine. Ameliaâ€™s shift wouldn't end for another three hours, but her mind was already adrift, caught in a swirling current of fatigue and worry. She had seen enough near-death experiences to know that time was precious, every beat of John's heart a battle fought on a battlefield she could only observe.  And tonight, it felt like the tide was turning against him.
