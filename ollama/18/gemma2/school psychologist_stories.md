The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, sickly shadows across Dr. Amelia Harding's office. It was the kind of Thursday afternoon where even the potted ferns seemed to droop with exhaustion. Outside, the autumn wind rattled the leaves against the windows, a rhythmic counterpoint to the monotonous whirring of the air purifier.  Amelia leaned back in her ergonomic chair, sighing as she skimmed through a student file.  

The name at the top – Ethan Lawson – felt heavy on the page. He was a quiet boy, known for his meticulous drawings and introverted nature. But lately, whispers had started circulating about him becoming increasingly withdrawn, muttering to himself, and avoiding contact with both teachers and classmates. Amelia knew that beneath those layers of shyness lurked something more, something troubling. She hoped Ethan would be willing to open up to her. 


The setting:  Oakwood High School, a sprawling brick building nestled amidst the rolling hills of suburban Connecticut.
