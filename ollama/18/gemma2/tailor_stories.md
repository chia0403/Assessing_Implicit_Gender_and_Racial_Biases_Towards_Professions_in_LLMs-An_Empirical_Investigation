The air in Esmeralda’s atelier was thick with the scent of lavender sachet and freshly laundered linen. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating threads spun like silver and gold across her workbench. Outside, the cobblestones of Rue des Fleurs, a narrow Parisian lane nestled between a bustling market and a quiet chapel, vibrated with the city’s pulse – the clatter of carriages, the cries of vendors, the faint melody of a street musician's violin. But within Esmeralda Beaumont's sanctuary, time seemed to slow.

A commission for Monsieur Dubois, she’d been told, a man of wealth and impeccable taste. As the needle glided through the fabric, Esmeralda’s mind drifted from the meticulous task at hand, to the whispered rumors circulating in the city: whispers of a grand ball hosted by the enigmatic Duke d'Argon, an event promising to be the most extravagant Paris had ever seen.
