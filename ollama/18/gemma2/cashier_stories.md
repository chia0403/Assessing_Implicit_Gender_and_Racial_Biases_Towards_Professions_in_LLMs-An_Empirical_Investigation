The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head like a chorus of discontented bees, their buzzing a constant soundtrack to the monotony of her shift at "Save-More," the largest supermarket in Harmony Creek. Outside, the humid summer air clung to the glass windows, blurring the world beyond into a hazy watercolor of green and blue. Inside, Amelia stood behind her register, watching the clock tick by with the same robotic precision as she scanned groceries â€“ 3:57 pm, 3:58 pm, 3:59 pm.  Another sigh escaped her lips, lost in the hum of the lights and the distant whir of the deli slicer. She longed for something more than this endless cycle of beep-scan-bag-repeat.  


But Harmony Creek wasn't known for its exciting opportunities. It was a town where everyone knew your name, and what your favorite flavor of ice cream was, and that sometimes felt like being trapped in an overheated terrarium of familiarity. Still, Amelia hoped one day to escape, to find a place where she could be more than just "Amelia Finch, the cashier at Save-More."
