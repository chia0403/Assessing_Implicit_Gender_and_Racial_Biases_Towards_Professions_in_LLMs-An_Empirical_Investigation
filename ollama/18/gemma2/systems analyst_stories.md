Tonight, she was on a mission: tracking down a rogue program that was wreaking havoc on their network security. This wasn't just another bug fix; this felt different, like a whisper in the digital dark hinting at something far more sinister lurking beneath the surface of GlobalTech's seemingly impenetrable system.
