The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the plastic chairs lined up in the waiting area. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and nervous anticipation. Amelia Harper sighed, her reflection wavering in the polished metal countertop as she straightened a blood pressure cuff.  

Amelia wasnâ€™t sure if it was the constant prickling sensation of needles against skin or the hushed anxieties of patients that made this job so emotionally draining. Either way, being a phlebotomist at Mercy General Hospital had become more akin to navigating a battlefield than drawing blood. 


Today, the waiting area was particularly tense. A young mother clutched her crying toddler, his tiny fist clenched tight around a worn stuffed bear. An elderly gentleman with eyes clouded by worry fidgeted in his seat. And then there was him: the man sitting at the back, shrouded in shadow, his face obscured by the brim of a fedora. He emanated an aura of secrecy that made Amelia's skin crawl. 


His name tag simply read "Mr. Jones."
