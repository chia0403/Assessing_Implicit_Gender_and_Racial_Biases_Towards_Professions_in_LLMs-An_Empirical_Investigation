The scent of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the damp chill that seeped in from the open window.

This one could change everything. Amelia took a deep breath and turned her attention back to the stack of notes scattered across her desk, determined to unravel the tangled web before the storm outside swallowed her whole.
