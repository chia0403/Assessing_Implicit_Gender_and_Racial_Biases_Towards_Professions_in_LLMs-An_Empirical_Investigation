The stale scent of old paper and burnt coffee hung heavy in Eleanor Amelia Cartwright's tiny office. It wasn't exactly the glamorous image she'd envisioned when she first started her career as an insurance agent five years ago. But then again, "glamorous" rarely came with endless phone calls from worried homeowners about leaky roofs or disgruntled clients who thought their premiums were too high. 

Eleanor pushed a stray blonde curl behind her ear, squinting at the computer screen. A file labelled "Mrs. Beatrice Jenkins - Accidental Petrifying Incident" blinked accusingly back at her.  It was a new one, this one. The latest in a long line of bizarre claims that had made Eleanor question everything she thought she knew about reality and insurance policy loopholes. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor as the first raindrops began to splat against the windowpane, adding to the dreary atmosphere of her office located above a dusty antique shop in the forgotten corner of Elmwood City.
