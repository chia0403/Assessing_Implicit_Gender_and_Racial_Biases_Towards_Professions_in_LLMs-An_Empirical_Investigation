The stale air of the Department of Corrections office hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her name as long and winding as the case files stacked precariously on her desk, stared out the grimy window at the grey, overcast sky mirroring her mood. Another day, another string of petty criminals, parole violators, and hopefuls clinging to the frayed edges of rehabilitation. 

Amelia had once believed in redemption, that second chances could blossom into something beautiful. But lately, the cynicism was creeping in, whispering doubts like a winter wind through cracked windowpanes.  She pushed aside the file on Jacob Miller, a young man caught with a stolen backpack (his tenth offense), and reached for the mug emblazoned with "World's Best Probation Officer" - a gift from her mother that felt increasingly ironic. 


The phone rang, jarring Amelia from her thoughts. It was always something. A missed appointment, a frantic call from a terrified parolee, or – as it turned out today – an urgent request from the Chief. The voice on the other end crackled with urgency, "Amelia, we need you at Central Station ASAP. This one's special."
