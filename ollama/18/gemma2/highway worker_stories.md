The sun beat down on Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery's back like an angry blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung her eyes as she wrestled with another section of chain-link fence, its cold metal biting into her palms. The air was thick with the smell of asphalt and dust, punctuated by the distant rumble of semis thundering past on the I-95, a behemoth of grey concrete slicing through the heart of Georgia. Bea squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt, a silent observer of the human tide rushing to unknown destinations. 

She wasn't sure where her own path was taking her, but for now, she was content with the simple rhythm of her work: shoveling gravel, mending fences, patching potholes – tiny acts of maintenance keeping this artery of America flowing. It wasn’t glamorous, but it kept her on solid ground, literally and figuratively. The highway held its own stories, whispers of journeys taken and lives lived, all passing through her patch of Georgia like leaves in a storm drain.  Bea just hoped that one day, she'd find a story worth telling herself.
