The humid Georgia air hung heavy over the bustling emergency room of St. Augustine General Hospital. The scent of antiseptic mingled with the cloying sweetness of desperation that always permeated this place.  Eleanor “Ellie” Vance, her stethoscope bouncing lightly against her chest as she rushed down the hallway, took a deep breath and braced herself. Her fingers tightened around the cold metal handle of a gurney as she rounded the corner, heading towards the chaotic heart of Trauma Bay 1.

The constant cacophony – beeping monitors, frantic shouts, and hurried footsteps – never truly subsided in this room, a symphony of human suffering that Ellie had come to recognize as her own personal orchestra. Tonight, however, there was an added edge to the tension, a palpable sense of urgency that crackled through the air like static electricity. 


Ellie glanced at the flashing red light above Trauma Bay 1, then towards the worn whiteboard where patient statuses were scribbled in hurried ink.  Her heart sank as she read the name scrawled beneath: "Johnathan Walker – Possible Cardiac Arrest."
