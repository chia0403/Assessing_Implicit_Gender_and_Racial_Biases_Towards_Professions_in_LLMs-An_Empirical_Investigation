The fluorescent lights hummed above Penelope Everleigh's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over her spreadsheets. Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy windows of the accounting office, each particle a tiny reflection of the stagnant air within. The scent of stale coffee and desperation clung to everything like a shroud. 

Penelope tapped her pen against her teeth, her brow furrowed as she wrestled with a particularly baffling discrepancy in Mr. Butterfield's accounts. He was a local antique dealer, notorious for his eccentricities and even more so for his convoluted business practices. Penelope had always suspected there was more to his dealings than met the eye, but proving it was another matter entirely. 

The clock ticked past three, its metallic clang echoing through the silent office. Outside, the grey November sky threatened rain, mirroring the gloom settling over Penelope's heart.  Another day, another mountain of numbers to climb, another mystery to unravel. This wasn't the life she'd envisioned for herself, but it was all she had. At least until she figured out what Mr. Butterfield was really hiding.
