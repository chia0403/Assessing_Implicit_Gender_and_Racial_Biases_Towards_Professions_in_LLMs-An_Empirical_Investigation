The midday sun beat down on Elias Bartholomew "Eli" Finch’s neck like an anvil. Sweat dripped from his brow, leaving streaks through the dust coating his face. He squinted at the aging shingles below him, their once vibrant crimson now faded to a dusty rose. The air thrummed with the buzzing of cicadas and the distant rumble of construction on the new development across town – a stark contrast to the creaky silence of this old Victorian manor. Eli wiped his brow again with a grimy rag, his calloused hand leaving a faint smear of soot against his forehead.

The house groaned around him, settling deeper into its century-old foundation. Each gust of wind whistled through the gaps in the weathered clapboard siding, and the scent of damp wood hung heavy in the air. Eli had worked on dozens of houses like this one – grand relics clinging to life in a city that seemed determined to replace them with sterile modernity. But there was something about this place, something unsettlingly quiet beneath its peeling paint and cracked gutters. As he reached for his hammer, Eli couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't alone on this roof.
