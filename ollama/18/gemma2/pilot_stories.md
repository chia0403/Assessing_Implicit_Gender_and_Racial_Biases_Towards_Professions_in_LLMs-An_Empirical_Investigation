The rusty airlock groaned as Amelia "Amy" Kensington wrestled it open, the smell of burnt metal and stale ozone hitting her like a wall. Outside, the crimson sun bled across the horizon, casting long shadows over the rust-eaten hulks of abandoned spacecraft scattered across the desolate landscape. This wasn't the glamorous life she envisioned when she first strapped herself into a cockpit at 16, but it was all that remained after the Great Collapse.  

Amy adjusted her worn flight helmet and activated her comms. "Control, this is Phoenix One. Ready for launch." 

Static crackled in response, then a weary voice, tinged with an accent Amy couldn't quite place. "Phoenix One, you have clearance for liftoff. Good luck out there, pilot."


The setting:  A desolate, post-apocalyptic Earth ravaged by a global disaster known as the Great Collapse. The remnants of humanity cling to survival in scattered settlements, scavenging what little remains from the shattered world.
