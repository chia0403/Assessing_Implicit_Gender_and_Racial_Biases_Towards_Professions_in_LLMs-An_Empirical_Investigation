The aroma of jasmine tea mingled with the faint scent of desperation clinging to the air in Isabella "Izzy" Rose's office. Outside, the bustling city of Mumbai thrummed with life – honking rickshaws weaving through traffic, vendors hawking their wares, and Bollywood tunes spilling from open doorways. But inside Izzy’s cramped cubicle, tucked away in a faded pink building on Colaba Causeway, the world felt eerily quiet. 

A crumpled brochure for “Bali: The Land of Gods & Glaciers” lay discarded on her desk next to a half-eaten samosa. Her laptop screen displayed a blank document, the cursor blinking accusingly, taunting her with its silence.  Izzy had been staring at it for hours, paralyzed by the weight of her predicament – no clients, mounting bills, and the constant gnawing fear that her travel agency, "Wanderlust Dreams," was about to become just another forgotten dream.
