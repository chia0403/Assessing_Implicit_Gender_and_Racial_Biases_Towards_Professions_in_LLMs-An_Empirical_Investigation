The biting wind whipped across the frozen plains of Alora, carrying with it the scent of pine and a hint of something else - fear. Eira Aelwyn tightened her grip on the hilt of her frost-steel glaive, its polished surface reflecting the pale moonlight filtering through the swirling snow. The watchtower creaked in protest against the gale, each gust threatening to tear the flimsy structure from its moorings. 

Eira scanned the endless white expanse, searching for any sign of movement beyond the howling wind and dancing shadows. For weeks, whispers had spread among the guards stationed along the frozen border - rumors of a creature stalking the plains, a behemoth with eyes like burning embers and claws that could cleave stone.  She dismissed them as fanciful tales, born of the long winter nights and dwindling morale. But tonight, a shiver snaked down her spine, an unsettling premonition that the stories might hold more than just myth.
