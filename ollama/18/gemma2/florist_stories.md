The air in Poppy Blossom's shop hung heavy with the scent of lilies and lavender, a cloying sweetness that usually soothed Amelia Willowbrook but today felt oppressive. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the vibrant hues of gerbera daisies and sunflowers into an impressionistic watercolor. Amelia, her chestnut braids escaping their braid and clinging to her damp forehead, sighed, pushing a stray strand behind her ear. 

It wasn't just the weather. A persistent unease had been creeping into Amelia's life, starting with the recent string of odd customer requests - lilies for funerals that hadn't occurred, sunflowers delivered anonymously, bouquets of wilting roses accompanied by cryptic notes. Now, a shiver ran down her spine as she noticed a new delivery, a single white calla lily resting on a pedestal in the center of the shop. Its pristine petals seemed to glow with an unnatural luminescence, and Amelia felt a prickle of apprehension at its stark beauty.  


This was no ordinary order. Something wasn't right, and Amelia Willowbrook, florist extraordinaire, was about to find out just how wrong things could get.
