The scent of jasmine nail polish lingered in the air, a sweet counterpoint to the faint tang of bleach from Amelia Beatrice Finch's recent deep clean. She leaned back against the pristine countertop, her reflection staring out from the chrome surface above. Her name tag, emblazoned with 'Amelia - Mani Queen', seemed to mock her current state: utter boredom. It was Wednesday afternoon, a lull in the usual manicured frenzy of "Beaute by Amelia", her tiny salon nestled within the bustling heart of Oakwood Square.  

Outside, the late summer sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone street, bathing the world in a hazy, golden light. Laughter from the park across the way mingled with the steady murmur of conversation spilling out from cafes. But inside "Beaute by Amelia", the only sound was the gentle hum of the fan and the rhythmic tapping of Amelia's acrylic nails against the glass partition separating her workspace from the waiting area. 


Where were her clients? Was it the dreary weather forecast promising an afternoon deluge, or simply a quiet Wednesday lull that had kept them away? The clock ticked on, each second echoing in the stillness.
