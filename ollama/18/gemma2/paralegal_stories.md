Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the cramped office, mimicking the hammering in Amelia "Amy" Harper's chest. The clock ticked relentlessly towards five p.m., each second an accusing hammer blow. She was drowning in a sea of legal briefs, their dry, jargon-filled language swirling around her like a suffocating mist.  

The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Her boss, Mr. Thornton, was due back any minute from court, his temper as volatile as the storm raging outside. He'd already chewed out poor intern Sarah this morning for misplacing a critical witness statement â€“ a statement Amy herself had meticulously organized just yesterday. 

Amy's cramped workspace in Thornton & Associates, nestled on the third floor of an aging brick building in downtown Chicago, wasn't exactly glamorous. It was a haven for forgotten files, dusty law books, and flickering fluorescent lights that cast long, menacing shadows across the cluttered desks. But it was her world, a world where she wrestled with legalese, juggled phone calls, and kept the legal machine churning. And tonight, the machine seemed determined to break her.
