The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant and anxiety. Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek Veterinary Clinic, each gust rattling the old oak tree that clawed its way up beside the building. Inside, Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne meticulously scrubbed her hands, her brow furrowed as she reviewed Jasper's file. The golden retriever lay whimpering on the examination table, his usually bright eyes clouded with pain. 

Willow Creek was a small town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, where everyone knew each other and their animals were considered part of the family. Amelia, known affectionately as "Dr. Rose" to the locals, had grown up here, tending to injured squirrels in her backyard and dreaming of healing creatures great and small. Now, with ten years of experience under her belt, she felt a familiar pang of responsibility for every furry face that crossed her threshold. 


Jasper's whimpers were getting louder, pulling Amelia back from the memories swirling through her mind.  It was going to be a long night.
