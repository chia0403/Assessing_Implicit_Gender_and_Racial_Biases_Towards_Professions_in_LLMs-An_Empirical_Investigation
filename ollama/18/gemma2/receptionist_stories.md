The muted hum of fluorescent lights buzzed above Eleanor Thistlewick's head like a swarm of agitated bees. It was the kind of sound that burrowed into your bones and refused to leave, a constant reminder of the tedium that permeated her existence as receptionist at  "Acme Solutions," a firm specializing in "innovative" paperclips (Eleanor suspected their true innovation was using interns to make coffee). 

She idly tapped away at the worn keys of her ancient keyboard, waiting for the phone to ring. It rarely did. Most clients communicated through email, which meant Eleanor spent most of her day staring at the blank wall across from her desk, occasionally glancing out the window at the grey, perpetually overcast sky that mirrored her mood. The only break in the monotony was when Mr. Bigglesworth, the office manager and self-proclaimed "king of spreadsheets," lumbered past, muttering about deadlines and quarterly reports, his tie askew and his hair resembling a startled badger.  

Suddenly, the phone shrieked to life, shattering the silence like a dropped champagne flute.  Eleanor flinched, then picked up the receiver with a practiced smile. 

"Acme Solutions, Eleanor speaking," she chirped into the mouthpiece, hoping this call wouldn't be another disgruntled intern complaining about their lack of coffee or another telemarketer hawking timeshares in Bermuda (she had sworn off those after the one who tried to sell her a "lifetime supply" of bath towels).
