The crisp mountain air whipped Amelia Rose Blackwood’s hair across her face as she navigated the winding path up to the abandoned observatory. It was almost dusk, casting long shadows across the weathered stone walls and rusted telescopes that peeked out from beneath layers of ivy. 

Amelia, a woman whose weathered hands spoke volumes of years spent caring for creatures both wild and tame, paused at the threshold. A low rumble emanated from within the old building, vibrating through her boots.  It wasn't the familiar growl of one of the wolves she’d rescued from poachers – it was something deeper, more primal. Her heart pounded against her ribs, a drumbeat echoing the strange tremor in the air. 


This wasn’t just another routine check on the observatory’s resident ghost crab colony and the occasional stray owl that sought shelter within its dusty rafters. This felt different, charged with an unnerving energy that sent shivers down Amelia’s spine. Whatever was stirring inside, it had been waiting for her.
