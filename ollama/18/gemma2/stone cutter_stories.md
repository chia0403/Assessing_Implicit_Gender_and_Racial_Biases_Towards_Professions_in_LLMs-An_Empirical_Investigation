The air hung thick with dust, a gritty haze that clung to Elara Stonehaven's throat like a second skin.  She inhaled deeply, the scent of granite and sweat a familiar comfort in her cramped workshop nestled deep within the bustling city of Aethelgard. Sunlight streamed through the gaps in the boarded windows, illuminating swirling motes and casting long shadows from the tools scattered across the floor. Elara ran a calloused hand over the rough surface of a half-carved bust, its granite form still bearing the faint imprint of the original model. Her brows furrowed as she traced the line of the cheekbone, searching for the perfect angle, the ideal curve to capture the life within the stone. 

Aethelgard, once a modest village nestled at the foot of the Whispering Mountains, had swelled into a sprawling metropolis in recent years. Its streets pulsed with the rhythm of trade and industry, a constant stream of merchants hawking their wares, artisans displaying their creations, and laborers toiling away in the shadow of towering guild halls. The city's prosperity was built upon the granite mined from the surrounding mountains, each block a silent testament to the tireless work of stonemasons like Elara. But while others sought fortune and fame within Aethelgard's gilded walls, Elara found solace in the quiet solitude of her workshop, her hands shaping stone into art, breathing life into lifeless matter.
