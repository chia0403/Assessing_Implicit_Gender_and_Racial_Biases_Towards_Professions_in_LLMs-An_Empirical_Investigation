The air hung thick with the scent of garlic and simmering stock, a familiar perfume to Elara Juniper Bellweather. She knew every nook and cranny of The Glimmering Kettle, from the worn, wooden floorboards under her feet to the chipped porcelain mugs stacked on the shelf behind the bar. 

It was Friday night, the heart of the week for The Glimmering Kettle, a cozy, dimly lit pub nestled in a forgotten corner of Oakhaven. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the flickering neon sign outside, casting dancing shadows across the mismatched furniture and jovial patrons inside. Laughter mingled with the clinking of glasses, creating a symphony of warm chaos that Elara knew by heart. She navigated the bustling room with practiced grace, balancing trays laden with steaming mugs and plates piled high with greasy fries and sticky toffee pudding.
