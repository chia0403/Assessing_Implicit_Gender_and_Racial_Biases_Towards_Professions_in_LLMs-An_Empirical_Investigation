The stench hit Bartholomew “Bart” Billingsworth first. A cloying, sulfurous miasma that clawed its way out from under the rusted sink in Mrs. Henderson’s kitchen and assaulted his nostrils like a rogue goblin wielding rotten eggs as weapons. Bart wrinkled his nose, already regretting accepting this late-night call. It was almost midnight, and all he wanted was to be curled up with a steaming mug of Earl Grey and his favorite mystery novel. But Mrs. Henderson, bless her kind but demanding heart, had a plumbing emergency that couldn't wait.

The setting: A cramped Victorian house on the edge of Willow Creek, a quaint town nestled in the Appalachian foothills. The air was thick with the humid sigh of a summer night, punctuated by the chirping of crickets and the distant howl of a lone coyote. Inside Mrs. Henderson’s kitchen, a single bare bulb hung from the ceiling, casting harsh shadows across chipped linoleum tiles and walls adorned with faded floral wallpaper.  The smell of sulfur was only amplified in this enclosed space, mingling with the aroma of burnt toast from the forgotten toaster oven on the counter. 


Bart, his toolbox tucked under one arm, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. The source of the problem, he guessed, was probably the old cast iron pipes that groaned under the pressure of even a modest amount of water use. This wasn't going to be a simple fix. He sighed, grabbed his wrench, and braced himself for another night of battling plumbing nightmares.
