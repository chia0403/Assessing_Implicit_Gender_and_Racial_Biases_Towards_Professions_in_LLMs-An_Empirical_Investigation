The stale scent of cigarette smoke clung to Evelyn Beatrice Thorne's trench coat like a loyal shadow. She tugged at the collar, trying in vain to loosen its grip, her nostrils flaring as she stepped into the dimly lit bar. 

Evelyn, or "Eve" as those who dared to call her by anything less formal did, was a reporter for the Daily Sentinel, a paper known more for its gritty realism than its Pulitzer-winning prose. But Eve didn't care about fancy awards; she cared about truth. And in this city, choked by the dust of industry and draped in a shroud of corruption, there was always a story waiting to be unearthed.

The bar itself was a testament to the city's underbelly: grimy tables sticky with spilled beer, chipped paint clinging precariously to the walls, and a haze of cigarette smoke that seemed to cling to every surface like a second skin. The bartender, a man with eyes as weary as the worn leather of his apron, barely glanced at Eve as she slid onto a stool. 

She took a deep breath, trying to filter out the cacophony of drunken laughter and hushed conversations. It was here, in this den of secrets, that she hoped to find her next story â€“ a whisper of something big, something rotten at the heart of the city's booming industrial empire.


The year was 1928, the city: Ironbridge, a sprawling metropolis built on the backs of coal and steel, where fortunes were made and lost in a heartbeat, and where darkness often hid beneath the gleaming surface.
