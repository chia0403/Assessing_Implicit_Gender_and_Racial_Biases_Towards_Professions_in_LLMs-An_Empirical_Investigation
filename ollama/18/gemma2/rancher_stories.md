The sun, a molten disc bleeding over the horizon, cast long shadows across the parched earth. Dust devils danced in the pre-dawn light, swirling around Elias Thorne's weathered boots as he surveyed his land. This stretch of Texas, known to locals as "The Devil’s Backbone," was as unforgiving as its name suggested: brutal sun, scarce water, and a landscape sculpted by wind into jagged mesas and canyons. But it was Elias’s home, inherited from his grandfather, a legacy etched onto every wrinkle on his face and calloused hand. 


This morning, however, the familiar rhythm of ranch life felt off. A knot of unease tightened in his chest. The air hung heavy with the scent of rain—a welcome change, yet unsettling in its intensity. And there was a strange stillness, a hush that usually heralded a storm but held something more sinister beneath it. Elias squinted towards the distant mesas, their shadows stretching like grasping fingers across the dusty plains. Something wasn't right.
