The scent of lilies, heavy and cloying, hung in the air like a shroud. Amelia Beatrice Kensington wrinkled her nose, subtly adjusting the silk scarf at her neck. It did little to mask the fragrance that permeated the grand yet gloomy manor house. She surveyed the scene: dust motes danced in the pale sunlight filtering through the grimy windows, cobwebs draped across forgotten portraits, and an unsettling silence hung heavy over the opulent rooms.  

Amelia, a young interior decorator with a penchant for vibrant colours and modern design, felt a prickle of unease. This wasn't her usual clientele â€“ stately homes with faded grandeur and whispers of family secrets weren't exactly Instagrammable. Yet, here she was, standing in the dusty hall of Blackwood Manor, tasked with breathing life back into the neglected estate. 

Her client, a reclusive woman named Eleanor Blackwood, had requested a complete overhaul, hinting at a desire to shed the shadows that clung to her family home. As Amelia took in the faded grandeur, she couldn't help but feel that the challenge wasn't just about aesthetics; it was about confronting the ghosts of the past, and maybe even exorcising them.
