The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, a counterpoint to the earthy musk that permeated Amelia Clementine’s small studio.  Sunlight, filtered through gauzy curtains, painted stripes across the wooden floor, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing in the quiet room. Outside, the city hummed with its usual midday bustle, but here, nestled between a noisy laundromat and a dusty antique shop on Elm Street, time seemed to stretch and sigh. 

Amelia, her dark hair pulled back in a loose braid, knelt beside the massage table, smoothing out the linen sheets. Her fingers traced the familiar contours of the worn wood, grounding herself before her next client arrived.  She was used to the rhythm of the day: the chime of the bell announcing each visitor, the rustle of clothing being shed, the murmurs of tension melting away under her touch. Yet, today, a prickle of unease danced along her skin. 


There was something different in the air, a subtle shift she couldn't quite place. She blamed it on the strange dream that had clung to her since dawn – a swirling vortex of shadows and whispers, leaving behind only a lingering sense of foreboding.  Perhaps it was just nerves; after all, today was her first day back at work after a month-long sabbatical in the mountains. 


The chime above the door tinkled, breaking Amelia's thoughts. She straightened, offering a warm smile to her next client, hoping whatever shadowed anxieties lingered would fade with the gentle touch of her hands.
