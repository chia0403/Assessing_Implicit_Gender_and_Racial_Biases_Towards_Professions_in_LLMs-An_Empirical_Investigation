The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Harold Percival Finch's head, casting long, skeletal shadows across the empty hallways of the Grand Blackwood Theater. The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and stale popcorn, a familiar perfume to Harold after twelve years as the theater's sole caretaker. It was well past midnight, and the only sound besides the hum came from Harold's rhythmic swish-swash as he pushed his mop across the cracked linoleum floor. 

The Grand Blackwood had seen better days. Once a glittering jewel of the city's entertainment scene, it now lay mostly forgotten, its grandeur obscured by peeling paint and tattered velvet curtains. The few remaining patrons were mostly elderly couples seeking escape from their silent homes, or thrill-seeking teens whispering tales of phantom footsteps echoing through the grand auditorium. 


Harold paused, his mop handle hovering over a chipped tile that always caught his eye.  He wasn't sure if it was the way the light hit it just so, or something more. A shiver ran down his spine, despite the stifling summer heat. He shook off the feeling, muttering to himself about needing a cup of strong coffee.
