Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish," blurring the neon sign that promised wholesome goodness. Inside, Amelia Beaumont smoothed down her apron, her reflection in the stainless steel counter showing a determined woman with auburn hair pulled back tight and eyes the color of storm clouds. The aroma of simmering vegetable broth filled the air, battling the scent of damp wool from the perpetually soggy street outside.

Amelia was no stranger to struggle. Her own journey had been paved with disordered eating and years spent trying to find balance in a world obsessed with quick fixes and fad diets. Now, she poured all her experience and passion into Nourish, a haven for those seeking genuine nourishment â€“ both physical and emotional.  Tonight, however, the usual hum of conversation was replaced by an unnerving quiet. The door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and a man whose face held the weight of secrets. 


"Amelia?" he rasped, his voice rough like gravel. "My name is David." He stepped into the warm light, leaving behind the storm and bringing with him the promise of something complicated.
