The fluorescent hum of the waiting room buzzed like a swarm of agitated bees trapped beneath the thick glass ceiling. Dr. Eloise Beaumont shifted uncomfortably in her worn leather chair, the familiar scent of antiseptic and stale coffee swirling around her. Outside, the relentless Los Angeles sun beat down on the cracked asphalt, turning the world outside into a shimmering mirage.  

Eloise tapped her pen against her notepad, the rhythmic clicking doing little to quell the growing tension inside her.  She glanced at the clock, its red digits taunting her with the minutes slipping away. She was already running late, and her next patient, Mr. Samuel Hayes, was notorious for his punctuality – a stark contrast to many of the others who wandered into her practice like lost souls seeking solace from the city’s relentless chaos.


"Dr. Beaumont," a gentle voice called out.  A young woman, her face etched with fatigue and worry, stood at the entrance. 

Eloise rose, offering a reassuring smile. "Welcome. Please come in."  The woman's eyes held a mixture of fear and desperation, mirroring the storm brewing within Eloise herself. This session wouldn't be about unraveling anxieties or processing grief – it would be about facing her own demons. Because tonight, Mr. Samuel Hayes was not just another patient; he was her past, come back to haunt her.
