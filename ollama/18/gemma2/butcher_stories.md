The steel gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of "Stan's Superior Meats." Blood, always blood, stained the floor tiles in intricate patterns that resembled Jackson Pollock paintings on an especially macabre day. The air hung thick with the metallic tang, punctuated by the rhythmic thunk of cleavers and the low murmur of Stanhope "Stan" Blackwood as he worked his magic.

Stan was a man carved from granite – broad-shouldered, weathered, and bearing a permanent scowl that could curdle cream. His hands, calloused and gnarled like ancient tree roots, moved with practiced precision, separating flesh from bone, expertly trimming fat, and meticulously arranging cuts of meat with the reverence of an artist displaying his masterpiece. 

His shop, tucked away on a forgotten side street in Baltimore, was a relic of a bygone era – cluttered with mismatched display cases, chipped porcelain scales, and shelves overflowing with jars of pickled delicacies.  A faded sign above the door proclaimed "Stan's Superior Meats: Where Quality Speaks for Itself," a claim that held true even if its audience dwindled daily as customers opted for sterile supermarket aisles. 


This was Stan’s world – a symphony of smells, textures, and sounds, where life and death were intimately intertwined in a dance he had orchestrated for over forty years. But today, the rhythm faltered, a discordant note ringing through his familiar routine.
