The humid Georgia air clung to Thomas "Tom" Blackwood like a second skin as he trudged up the porch steps of Mrs. Eleanor Peabody's ramshackle Victorian. Spanish moss draped from the ancient oak in the yard like ghostly fingers, swaying gently in the breeze that carried the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Tom adjusted his tool belt, the familiar weight reassuring against his hips.

And Mrs. Peabody, despite her dwindling fortune and leaky roof, was one of his oldest clients. She insisted on paying him in homemade peach cobbler and stories about her youth, which Tom secretly enjoyed.  Today's problem: flickering lights that threatened the delicate balance of Mrs. Peabody's antique collection and, apparently, her sanity.
