The rain hammered against Officer Amelia "Amy" Hayes' patrol car like a thousand tiny fists, blurring the neon signs of downtown Aurora into streaks of color. She hated this kind of weather. It made everything feel heavy, oppressive. The air itself felt thick with the scent of damp asphalt and stale cigarette smoke. 

Amy adjusted her visor, squinting through the windshield at the flickering red-and-blue lights reflecting off the slick pavement ahead. A call had come in about a possible domestic disturbance on Maple Street â€“ always a dice roll in this part of town. She gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the worn leather.  She hoped it wouldn't be another night of broken promises and bruised egos.
