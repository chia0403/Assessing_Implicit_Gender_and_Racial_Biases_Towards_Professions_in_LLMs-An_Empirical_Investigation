The rain drummed a relentless tattoo against Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Thorne's window, mirroring the rhythm of anxiety humming in her chest. The Seattle skyline, usually a breathtaking tapestry of steel and glass shimmering under the ever-present clouds, was tonight reduced to a hazy, grey blur. Inside her cozy office, tucked away in a quiet corner of Capitol Hill, Evelyn sat poised with pen hovering over paper, but words refused to come. Her latest patient, a young musician named Kai, had left an unsettling silence hanging heavy in the air after their session.  

Evelyn wasn't sure what was more unnerving - Kai's sudden withdrawal, his gaze seemingly fixed on something beyond her, or the cryptic note he'd left behind, scrawled on a music sheet: "The melody hides in the silence." 


Her phone buzzed, breaking the tense quiet. A text from her best friend and colleague, Dr. Liam O'Connell, simply read: "Got your message. Come by for coffee, need to talk."  Evelyn knew instinctively this wasn't about work. Liam had a way of sensing things, his intuition as sharp as Evelynâ€™s analytical mind. 


Maybe, just maybe, Liam could help untangle the knot in her stomach. Maybe together, they could decipher the unsettling melody hidden within Kai's silence.
