The hum of the Boeing 747 was Amelia Grace Butterfield's lullaby. She moved through the cramped aisle like a dancer, balancing trays laden with lukewarm coffee and overpriced sandwiches.  Sunlight streamed in through the tiny windows, casting stripes across the faces of her passengers: businessmen hunched over laptops, families squabbling over shared screens, and lone travelers staring out into the endless blue canvas below. Amelia's smile was practiced, her demeanor polished to a sheen that could deflect even the most demanding passenger. She was an expert at navigating the emotional turbulence of air travel, soothing frayed nerves with a reassuring word and a warm cup of chamomile tea.

This particular flight was from Paris to New York, a Tuesday morning crossing steeped in the bittersweet aroma of stale croissants and distant dreams. As Amelia reached for the overhead compartment above seat 24B, she noticed something out of place: a small, worn leather briefcase nestled between a brightly colored travel pillow and a crumpled novel.  It wasn't like any piece of luggage she'd encountered before, radiating an air of mystery that sent a shiver down her spine.   This was going to be anything but a routine flight.
