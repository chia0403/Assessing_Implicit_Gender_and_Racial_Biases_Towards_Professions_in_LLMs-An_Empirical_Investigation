The fluorescent lights hummed above Ms. Emilia Thorne's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the worn linoleum floor.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight slicing through the grimy windows, illuminating the piles of overdue paperwork on her desk.  Her office, tucked away in the far corner of Northgate High School, felt more like an abandoned attic than a sanctuary for troubled teens. 

Emilia sighed, rubbing her temples, a familiar ache pulsing behind her eyes. It was always like this at the start of the school year - a whirlwind of anxious parents, overwhelmed freshmen, and seniors grappling with existential dread.  She craved a quiet moment, a sip of lukewarm coffee untouched by sugar, but the constant trickle of students needing guidance made that a luxury she couldn't afford. 


The squeak of her office door heralded the arrival of her next visitor. "Ms. Thorne?" A timid voice broke through the silence.  Emilia looked up, offering a tired smile. "Come in, come in. Have a seat."
