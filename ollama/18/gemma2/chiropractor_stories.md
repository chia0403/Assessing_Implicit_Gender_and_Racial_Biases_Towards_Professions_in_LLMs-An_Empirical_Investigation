The scent of eucalyptus and lavender hung heavy in the air, a calming counterpoint to the rhythmic crunch of bones settling back into place. Sunlight streamed through the frosted glass windows of Dr. Amelia Croft’s practice, bathing the waiting room in a soft, warm glow.  

Amelia paused at the door, listening to the gentle hum of conversation and the comforting clink of ceramic teacups against saucers. It was always like this – a tapestry of quiet anticipation woven with subtle anxieties. She smiled, knowing that within these walls, pain would find relief, tension would melt away, and hope would be rekindled. 

She stepped into the room, her practiced smile widening as she greeted a young woman clutching her shoulder, a flicker of fear in her eyes. "Good morning," Amelia said warmly, her voice a soothing balm against the unspoken worry. "Welcome to Croft Chiropractic. I'm Dr. Croft."
