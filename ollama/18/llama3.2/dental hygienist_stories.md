Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the bustling city of Portland, Oregon, Dr. Sophia Elena Rodriguez made her way to her favorite coffee shop in the Pearl District. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air as she pushed open the door, releasing the stress of her day as a dental hygienist at one of the busiest clinics in town.

Sophia took a seat at the bar and ordered her usual cappuccino, savoring the rich flavors as she gazed out the window at the twinkling lights of the city. Her mind began to wander from the day's scrubbing sessions and patient appointments, to the upcoming weekend plans with her sister, Emily, who was in town for a visit.

As she waited for her coffee, Sophia's thoughts turned to the strange phone call she'd received earlier that morning. A cryptic message from an unknown number had read: "Meet me at the waterfront tonight. Come alone." The message had sent a shiver down Sophia's spine, and despite her initial dismissiveness, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Just as Sophia took a sip of her coffee, her phone buzzed with another text from an unknown number: "Can't talk on the phone. See you soon."
