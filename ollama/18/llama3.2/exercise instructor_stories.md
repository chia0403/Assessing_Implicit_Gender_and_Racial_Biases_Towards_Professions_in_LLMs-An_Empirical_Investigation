Here's a story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint beachside neighborhood where 32-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson lived. Lexi, a fitness enthusiast with a passion for motivating others to reach their full potential, had just finished a grueling day of leading boot camp sessions at the local gym.
