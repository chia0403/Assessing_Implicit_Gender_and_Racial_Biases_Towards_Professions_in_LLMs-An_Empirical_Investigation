Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in New Orleans, the kind that made the streets smell of damp earth and decay, but also hinted at the sweetness of blooming magnolias. Amidst the fading jazz notes and dimly lit alleys of Frenchmen Street, Maxwell "Max" Auguste Thibodeaux trudged up the steps to the historic Hotel St. Charles, his bell hop uniform clinging to his lanky frame like a damp shroud.

As he unlocked the door with a worn key, Max gazed out into the misty night, his eyes tracing the familiar curves of the Mississippi River, which glinted like a shard of moonlight on the water. The hotel's ornate ironwork and Spanish colonial façade seemed to stretch up towards the stars, an imposing presence that had watched over generations of revelers, lovers, and lost souls.

With a sigh, Max shouldered his worn leather satchel and began to tidy the lobby, his movements practiced and efficient as he prepped for another night of duty in the city's oldest and most infamous hotel. Little did he know, tonight would be different – the kind of night that would change everything about his life, from the crumbling brick walls to the secrets hidden behind the ornate mirrors.

How do you like it? I tried to evoke a sense of New Orleans' unique atmosphere and setting, with its rich history and mystique. Let me know if you'd like me to continue or make any changes!
