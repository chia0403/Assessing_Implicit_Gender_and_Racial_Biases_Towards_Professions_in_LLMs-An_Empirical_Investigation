Here's a story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Emily Joanne Wilson stood behind the front desk of her small firm, staring blankly at the clock on the wall. It was 4:45 PM on a typical Monday afternoon, and the office was already feeling like a tomb, the only sound being the soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead.

Emily, or Emmy as she liked to be called, had been working as the receptionist at Smith & Associates for three years now. She took pride in her work, ensuring that every client who walked through the door felt welcome and taken care of. Her days were filled with answering phones, scheduling appointments, and making copies - all while trying to keep her mind from wandering to more exciting places.

As she gazed out the window, watching the rain drum against the glass, Emmy's thoughts turned to her own life outside of work. She was 25 years old, living in a small studio apartment above her parents' house, and working on building up her savings so she could leave the corporate world behind and pursue her true passion - photography.

The phone on her desk jolted her back to reality, breaking the spell that had been cast over her. She picked it up, answered the call, and began her daily ritual of pretending to be a functioning member of society. "Smith & Associates, this is Emmy speaking. How can I help you?"
