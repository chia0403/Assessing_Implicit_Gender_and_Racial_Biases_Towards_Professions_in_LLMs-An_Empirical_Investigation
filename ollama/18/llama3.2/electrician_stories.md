Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of downtown Seattle reflected off the wet pavement as Jack Harrison Harris, a seasoned electrician with a penchant for fixing anything that had a circuit board, stood outside his small workshop on 5th Avenue. The sound of rain pattering against the tin roof echoed through the narrow alleyway, where the smell of ozone and damp earth filled the air.

Jack's eyes scanned the crowded streets, his mind already tuned to the day's schedule. A 9 a.m. meeting with a potential new client at the Space Needle, followed by a visit from the landlord to collect rent on time for the workshop, which was struggling to stay afloat amidst the rising costs of materials and labor in the city.

As he checked his phone for what felt like the hundredth time that morning, Jack's thoughts drifted back to the peculiar request he'd received over the weekend â€“ a mysterious client seeking someone with "unique skills" to investigate an allegedly haunted electrical panel at an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of town. The pay was decent, and the prospect of solving a real-life mystery was too enticing to ignore.

With a deep breath, Jack steeled himself for the long day ahead, grabbed his toolbox from the back of the truck, and set off into the gray Seattle morning, ready to face whatever challenges came his way.
