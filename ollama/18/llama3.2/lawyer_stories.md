Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans glistened like polished onyx as the misty dawn broke over the Mississippi River. The sound of jazz music drifted through the air, mingling with the scent of beignets and coffee wafting from Café du Monde. Amidst this vibrant backdrop, Aurora "Rory" Elara Thayer stood at her desk, staring out the window of her office building, a worn leather portfolio clutched in her gloved hands.

As a defense attorney specializing in white-collar crime cases, Rory had spent years honing her skills on the streets of NOLA, where corruption and deceit seemed to seep from every pore. Her eyes, an arresting shade of indigo, seemed to bore into the rain-soaked world outside, as if searching for something just beyond the veil of reality.

Rory's sharp mind and quick wit had earned her a reputation among her peers as one of the most formidable lawyers in the city. Yet, despite her professional successes, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched – by someone or something that lurked in the shadows, waiting for its moment to strike. Little did Rory know, this particular morning would bring a case that would test her skills and push her to the limits of her abilities.
