The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Canyon, casting a reddish-orange glow over the dusty terrain as Jack "Hawk" Hawkins climbed out of his worn-out truck, its tires kicking up small clouds of dirt with each movement. Hawk had been working as a heavy equipment operator in this remote canyon for months now, taking on odd jobs and hauling supplies to the various mining camps that dotted the landscape.

As he stretched his weathered frame, Hawk gazed out at the sprawling canyon, its towering walls rising high above him like giants from some ancient legend. He had always been drawn to this rugged beauty, ever since he was a young boy growing up in the nearby town of Redemption, where the only thing more abundant than the red rock was the stories of old. His father, a grizzled old miner himself, used to regale Hawk with tales of lost mines and hidden treasures, sparking an insatiable curiosity within him that had only grown stronger over the years.

Now, as he prepared for another long day of work ahead, Hawk's thoughts turned to the mysterious letter he'd received earlier that morning. It was addressed to him, but there were no return address or any indication who might have sent it. All it said was: "Meet me at the old windmill on the west side of Red Rock at sundown. Come alone."
