Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the bustling streets of New Haven, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded sidewalks and storefronts. Inside the sleek, modern office building at 345 Main Street, salesperson Maxwell Everett Wellesley was wrapping up his last meeting of the day. His clients had left with new orders for his company's top-of-the-line widgets, and he had closed a major deal with a prominent manufacturer.

As he locked his briefcase and headed out into the cool evening air, Maxwell couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the sense of exhaustion that came with a long day of closing deals – it was a nagging feeling that lingered beneath the surface, like a faint hum of unease.

Maxwell took a deep breath and began his walk to the parking garage, his eyes scanning the crowded street below. He knew New Haven like the back of his hand, and he had always loved its energy and vibrancy. But tonight, something felt different. The city seemed quieter than usual, and the shadows cast by the streetlights seemed to be stretching out a little farther.

As he stepped into the parking garage, Maxwell's phone buzzed with an incoming text from his sister, Emily – a journalist who worked for the local newspaper. "Hey, Max," she typed. "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. I have something important to tell you."

Maxwell felt a shiver run down his spine as he hesitated for a moment before responding with a simple "okay." He had no idea what Emily was talking about, but he knew that when it came to his sister, you always showed up.
