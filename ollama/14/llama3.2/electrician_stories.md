Here's a story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood City gleamed like polished onyx, reflecting the dim glow of streetlights that cast long shadows across the deserted sidewalks. It was a chilly autumn evening, the kind that made you want to curl up by a warm fire with a good book instead of venturing out into the gloom.

In a small, cluttered workshop nestled between a vintage clothing store and a 24-hour diner, Elijah "Eli" Thompson hunched over his workbench, his eyes fixed intently on the tangled mess of wires and circuits before him. A master electrician with years of experience under his belt, Eli was known for his exceptional problem-solving skills and his ability to coax even the most recalcitrant electrical systems back into working order.

As he carefully stripped the insulation from a particularly knotty wire, Eli's mind wandered to the strange job offer that had come in earlier that day. The client, a reclusive millionaire with a reputation for being ruthless in his business dealings, wanted Eli to install a custom electrical system in an abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town. Rumors swirled that the mansion was haunted, and many thought it was cursed. But Eli wasn't one to believe in ghost stories â€“ or so he told himself.

Just then, the workshop's phone rang, shrill and insistent, shattering the silence like a shot glass dropped on the floor. Eli sighed, rubbed the weariness from his eyes, and answered the call. "Eli Thompson Electric," he said, already knowing that this was going to be a long night.
