Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Eliana Sophia Patel stepped out of her small apartment in New Delhi, India, and took a deep breath of the humid morning air. The streets were already bustling with activity, the sounds of horns honking and people chattering filling the air as the city came to life. Eliana gazed up at the towering skyscrapers of the city's upscale residential area, their gleaming glass and steel facades a stark contrast to the narrow alleys and cramped market stalls that wound through the older parts of town.

As she began her daily commute to the hospital where she worked as a leading expert in infectious diseases, Eliana felt a sense of unease creeping over her. A recent outbreak of a mysterious illness had been making headlines, with reports of patients showing up at emergency rooms across the city, all displaying similar symptoms: high fever, severe headache, and skin rashes. The local government was scrambling to contain the spread of the disease, but Eliana suspected that it was already spreading too quickly.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Eliana's mind turned to the patients who were waiting for her at the hospital. There was Mrs. Kumar, an elderly woman who had been bedridden with symptoms similar to those reported in the outbreak; Rohan, a young businessman who had been rushed to the ER with severe abdominal pain; and Dr. Khan, a colleague of Eliana's who had gone missing during the previous night's emergency shift.

The hospital loomed ahead, its imposing structure a reassuring presence amidst the chaos of the city. But as Eliana pushed through the revolving doors and into the sterile corridors within, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - that this outbreak was more than just a coincidence, and that her own role in uncovering its truth would soon be put to the test.
