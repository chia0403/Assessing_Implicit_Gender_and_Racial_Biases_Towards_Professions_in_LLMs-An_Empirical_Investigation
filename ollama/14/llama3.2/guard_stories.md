Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The moon cast its pale light over the crumbling walls of Ravenshire Castle, illuminating the narrow alleyways and torch-lit courtyards that seemed to whisper secrets to one another in the darkness. It was a night like any other in the sleepy town of Ashwood, where the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves.

Inside the castle walls, Guardsman Elwes Ryder stood at attention, his eyes fixed on the clock tower that loomed above him like a skeletal sentinel. He had spent countless nights like this patrolling these same corridors, watching for any sign of movement or disturbance in the stillness.

Elwes was a man in his mid-twenties, with broad shoulders and a strong jawline that had been chiseled from years of working outdoors. His dark brown hair was slicked back, revealing a scattering of scars above his left eyebrow that told the story of a long-forgotten fight. He wore the standard-issue black uniform of the Ravenshire Guard, adorned with a silver pin bearing the crest of their noble patrons.

As he waited for the clock to strike midnight, Elwes couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The castle had been quiet all day, but he had caught glimpses of movement out of the corner of his eye - shadowy figures darting around corners, flickers of candlelight in the windows above.

And then, just as the clock struck twelve, Elwes heard it: a faint scratching noise, like fingernails on stone, coming from deep within the castle's depths. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he raised his lantern and took a step forward, ready to face whatever darkness lurked in the shadows.
