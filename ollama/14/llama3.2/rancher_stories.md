Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of open range, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and scrubby desert vegetation that stretched out as far as the eye could see. On the small ranch known as Red Rock Ranch, situated about an hour outside the dusty town of Redemption, Montana, rancher Adrien "Drew" Everett stood at the edge of the corral, surveying his domain with a practiced eye.

As he squinted against the fading light, Drew's weathered Stetson hat shaded his face from the glare, revealing a scattering of wrinkles etched into his forehead and cheeks. His calloused hands rested on the worn leather saddle of his horse, a sturdy chestnut mare named Luna who had been with him since her foaling day.

At 42 years old, Drew had spent most of his life working on this ranch, learning the ins and outs of cattle ranching from his father before him. He took pride in being one of the few remaining independent ranchers in a state where big agribusiness had all but swallowed up the small outfits. Drew's Red Rock Ranch was no exception – it was a tight-knit family operation that relied on hard work, tradition, and an unwavering commitment to preserving the natural beauty and wild spirit of this vast and unforgiving land.

As he gazed out at the ranch, his mind began to wander to the letter he'd received earlier that day from the state's agriculture department – a letter that had set off a chain reaction of worry and unease in Drew's gut. Something was brewing in the world of big agribusiness, something that threatened not just his own livelihood but the way of life he held dear.
