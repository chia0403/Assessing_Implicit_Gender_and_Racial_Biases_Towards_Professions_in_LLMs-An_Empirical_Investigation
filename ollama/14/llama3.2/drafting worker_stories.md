Here's a potential story opening and setting:

In the dimly lit, smoke-filled bars that lined the waterfront of New Haven, Connecticut, 25-year-old Harold "Hal" Thompson sat hunched over a whiskey-stained bar, nursing his second drink of the evening. As a drafting worker at a local shipyard, Hal spent most of his days designing blueprints for the massive vessels that sailed in and out of the harbor, but tonight he had other things on his mind.

The smell of saltwater and diesel fuel filled the air as the fog rolled in off the Long Island Sound, casting a misty veil over the city. The sound of seagulls and the occasional shout from a passerby provided a soothing background hum, but Hal's mind was elsewhere. He had just received a letter from his estranged father, a letter that hinted at secrets about their family's past that Hal had never known.

As he gazed out into the darkness, Hal's thoughts turned to the mysterious letter, and the questions it had raised about his own identity and purpose. What did his father want him to know? And what lay hidden beneath the surface of this sleepy coastal town?

With a sigh, Hal tossed a few more dollars on the bar and stood up, the wooden stool scraping against the floorboards as he made his way out into the fog-shrouded night, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
