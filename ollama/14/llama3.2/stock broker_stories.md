Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Manhattan gleamed like polished onyx as Elliot James Wyatt stepped out of his high-rise office building and onto the sidewalk. The neon lights of the towering skyscrapers cast a gaudy glow over the crowded sidewalks, a stark contrast to the somber mood that had settled over him. At 32, Elliot was one of the top stock brokers on Wall Street, with a reputation for being ruthless in his pursuit of profit and calculating in his dealings.

As he lit a cigarette and took a long drag, the cool mist of the morning air carried the sounds of car horns, chatter, and the wail of sirens in the distance. The financial district was always a hive of activity, but on this particular day, Elliot felt like an outsider, observing the chaos from the window of his high-rise office while wondering if he'd made the right choices with his life.

Elliot's eyes scanned the crowded streets, searching for a familiar face or a glimpse of the woman who had changed everything. He squinted into the rain-soaked distance, his mind replaying the events of the previous night and the phone call that still sent a shiver down his spine. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a week that would shake him to his core.

This is just a starting point, and you can feel free to modify it as you see fit!
