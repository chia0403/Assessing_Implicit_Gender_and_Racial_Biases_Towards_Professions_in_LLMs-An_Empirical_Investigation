Here's a story opening and setting:

The rain poured down on the grey streets of Seattle like a relentless curtain, casting a misty veil over the city's bustling tech scene. Inside his small, cluttered apartment, Elliot Thompson sat hunched over his laptop, fingers flying across the keyboard as he worked to meet an impossible deadline.

As a lead programmer for the cutting-edge tech firm NeuroSpark, Elliot was no stranger to late nights and endless cups of coffee. But tonight felt different – tonight was the night he would finally crack the code that had been eluding him for weeks.

The hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen provided a steady beat, while the sound system piped in a melancholy tune from his favorite indie band. The walls were adorned with posters of sci-fi movies and comic book characters, a testament to Elliot's nerdy roots. His messy brown hair stuck out in every direction, and a scattering of stubble on his chin gave him a perpetually sleep-deprived look.

Elliot's eyes darted back and forth between the lines of code streaming across his screen, his mind racing with possibilities. He had been hired by NeuroSpark to develop an AI system that could revolutionize the field of neuroscience – but so far, he was no closer to cracking the problem than when he started.

With a sigh, Elliot rubbed his tired eyes and leaned back in his chair, the laptop still clutched in his hand. Maybe it was time for a break... or maybe he just needed to push through one more night of coding to finally see some progress. The rain outside seemed to be pounding out a rhythm on his doorstep – would tonight be the night he figured it out?
