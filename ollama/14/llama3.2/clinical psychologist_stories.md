Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the rooftop garden, gazing out over the tranquil oasis in the heart of Manhattan. The warm sunlight cast a golden glow on the lush greenery, and the soft chirping of birds provided a soothing background melody as she took a deep breath, feeling the stress of her day begin to melt away.

As a clinical psychologist with a specialty in trauma treatment, Lexi had seen her fair share of darkness and despair. But it was moments like these, suspended above the bustling city streets, that reminded her why she'd dedicated her career to helping others find healing and hope.

It was a serene escape from the chaos of the hospital's corridors, and a place where she could clear her mind and recharge for the emotionally charged work that lay ahead.
