Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Portland gleamed like polished onyx as Dr. Alexandra "Alex" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp morning air. As an occupational therapist at a local rehabilitation center, Alex was no stranger to drizzly days and grey skies, but today felt particularly somber. She took a deep breath, feeling the weight of her own exhaustion settle onto her shoulders like a shroud.

Alex's eyes scanned the quiet neighborhood street, taking in the familiar sights of the old Victorian houses and neatly manicured lawns. It was a world away from the chaotic halls of Oakwood Rehabilitation Center, where she spent most of her days helping patients rebuild their lives after injury or illness. But even on her days off, Alex couldn't shake the feeling that she was always "on call" – ready to dash back into the fray at a moment's notice.

As she made her way to the local coffee shop, Alex's mind wandered to her own struggles with balance and coordination. Just last week, she'd taken a tumble on the sidewalk while walking home from work, twisting her ankle in the process. The pain and frustration still lingered, making it hard for her to shake off the feeling that she was losing control.

The aroma of freshly brewed coffee enveloped Alex as she pushed open the door to her favorite café, "The Cozy Cup." It was a haven she'd discovered on one of her own therapy sessions gone awry – a place where the baristas knew her name and offered her a warm smile whenever she walked in. Little did they know, today would be an especially rough day for Alex Thompson.

How's this? I tried to set up Alex as a complex character with personal struggles, while establishing the setting and atmosphere of the story.
