Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had just begun to set over the small coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint shops and homes that lined the narrow streets. The smell of saltwater and fresh seafood wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of seagulls crying overhead.

In her own cozy massage therapy studio, nestled above the local surf shop, 32-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson was preparing for another busy evening. Lexi's hands moved deftly as she tidied up the equipment and restocked the scented oils, her mind already racing with the various knots and kinks she would encounter in the evening's sessions.

A graduate of the prestigious Bayview College of Massage Therapy, Lexi had built a loyal client base over the years, drawn to her intuitive touch and calming presence. She took pride in her work, carefully crafting each massage to address not just the physical tension of her clients' bodies, but also the emotional stress that often lingered beneath.

As she slipped on the final layer of essential oils – a blend of lavender and eucalyptus that always seemed to calm even the most frazzled nerves – Lexi felt a sense of contentment wash over her. This was her happy place: surrounded by the soothing sounds of the ocean, with the gentle thrum of the surf shop's music below, and the soft glow of the setting sun casting a warm light on everything.

Little did Lexi know, tonight would bring an unexpected interruption – one that would shake her peaceful routine and set off a chain of events that would change her life forever.
