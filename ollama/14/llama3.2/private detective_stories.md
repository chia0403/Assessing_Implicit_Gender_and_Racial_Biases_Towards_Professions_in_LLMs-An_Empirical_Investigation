Here's a potential story opening and setting for a private detective tale:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle, the kind of night that made you want to stay inside with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the world outside. But for Emilia "Mia" Rodriguez, a gumshoe private investigator with a penchant for getting into sticky situations, there was no escaping the rain - or the mystery that had brought her to the doorstep of the rundown office building on 5th Avenue.

As she stepped out of her rain-soaked cab and onto the wet pavement, the flickering neon signs of the city's underbelly cast a gaudy glow over the deserted streets. The rain drummed against the pavement like a thousand tiny drums, echoing off the towering skyscrapers that loomed above the seedy bars and pawnshops.

Inside her office, a cramped but cozy cubbyhole tucked away in the heart of Pioneer Square, Mia sat at her desk, nursing a cold cup of coffee and staring at the latest addition to her growing list of unsolved cases. The one that was eating at her like a sour stomach, refusing to let her shake it: the disappearance of Sarah Jenkins, a young socialite with connections to the city's elite, whose vanishing act had left Mia with more questions than answers.

As she gazed out the rain-streaked window, her mind began to wander back to that fateful night when Sarah had walked into her office, her eyes wide with fear, and told Mia a story that would change everything. A story about secrets, lies, and the dark underbelly of Seattle's high society.

And now, as she stood outside her office building, the rain dripping down her face like a cold shroud, Mia couldn't shake the feeling that time was running out - and that she was the only one who could unravel the tangled threads of Sarah's disappearance before it was too late.
