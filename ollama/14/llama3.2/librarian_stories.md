Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the sky, casting the old town square in a warm orange glow, Emilia Rose Waverley made her way through the quiet streets of Ashwood. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. It was a smell that always seemed to bring out memories of autumn afternoons spent poring over dusty tomes in the very library where Emilia now worked.

The library, located on Main Street at the heart of Ashwood's charming downtown area, had been a staple of the community for generations. As a librarian, Emilia took pride in its shelves upon shelves of well-worn classics and obscure treasures, each one telling a story that she was eager to share with her patrons.

As she walked, the shadows cast by the trees grew longer, stretching out like skeletal fingers across the pavement. Emilia quickened her pace, feeling a sense of unease creeping over her. It wasn't just the fading light that made her feel this way â€“ it was something else entirely, a feeling that had been growing inside her all day.

And then, just as she turned onto Elm Street and caught sight of the library's familiar facade, Emilia noticed it: a small, cryptic message scrawled across the doorstep in red ink.
