Here's a potential story opening:

As she scrubbed the last of the morning's patients from her schedule, Emily Rae Jenkins couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over her. It was Saturday morning, and the quiet rhythms of her small town dentist office were usually a welcome respite from the hustle and bustle of weekday dental hygiene routines.

Emily Rae, or Em as she was known to her friends and patients, had always loved the tactile satisfaction of scaling teeth and polishing smiles. But lately, she'd been feeling like something was missing - a sense of purpose beyond just keeping teeth clean.

The old oak tree outside her office window creaked softly in the breeze, its leaves rustling against the worn brick fa√ßade. Inside, the dental equipment hummed along to a steady beat, punctuated by the occasional beep from the computer system. It was a peaceful morning, but Em's mind kept wandering back to the strange phone call she'd received last night.

She had no idea who'd called or why they wanted to meet with her on such short notice, but there was something in their low, gravelly voice that sent a shiver down her spine. "It's about your past," they'd said simply. "You don't know the half of it."

With a sigh, Em began to shut down the equipment and tidy up the office for the day, her mind whirling with possibilities.
