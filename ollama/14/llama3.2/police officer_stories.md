Here's a potential story opening:

Detective Emilia Rose Jenkins stepped out of her cruiser and onto the cracked asphalt of Main Street, gazing up at the old diner that had been the gathering place for this small town's residents for generations. The neon sign creaked in the gentle breeze, casting a faint glow over the deserted parking lot. It was a chilly autumn evening, the kind that made you want to curl up with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the troubles of the world. But tonight, Emilia's mind was elsewhere.

The diner's owner, Lucy Lee, had called her earlier in the day, frantic with worry over a reported break-in at the diner. Emilia had rushed over, but when she arrived, she found Lucy pacing back and forth outside, looking like she'd lost her last friend. The only clue to what might have happened was a single word scrawled on the diner's front door in red letters: "They're watching".

As Emilia surveyed the scene, she couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't an isolated incident - not when it seemed like nothing good ever came to pass in Ravenswood, Pennsylvania. Little did she know, tonight was just the beginning of a very long night.

(Ravenswood is a small town in central Pennsylvania.)
