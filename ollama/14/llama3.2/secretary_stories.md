Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly Wednesday morning in late April when Emilia Rose Thompson trudged into the office, her heels clicking on the worn linoleum floor. The fluorescent lights overhead seemed to hum in sync with the steady beat of her headache, which had been brewing since the previous night's late-night Netflix binge.

Emilia, or Mia as she was known to most of her coworkers, was a secretary at a small, but esteemed marketing firm in downtown Atlanta. She took pride in being the first face that potential clients saw when they walked through the door, and she always made sure to wear a bright smile and a freshly pressed blouse.

As she dumped her purse onto her desk and began to sort through the day's mail, Emilia gazed out the window at the rain-soaked streets below.

Mia sighed inwardly as she began to tackle the day's tasks, her mind still foggy from the previous night's escapades. She knew that today would be one of those days â€“ the kind where everything seemed to go wrong, and she was the only one who could keep it all together.
