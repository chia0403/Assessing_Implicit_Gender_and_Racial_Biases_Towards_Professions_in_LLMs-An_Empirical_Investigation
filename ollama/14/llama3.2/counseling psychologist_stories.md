Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emilia Rose Thompson stepped out of her office building and into the crisp autumn air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the sprawling campus of Oakwood University. As a counseling psychologist with a specialization in trauma recovery, she had spent countless hours listening to students navigate the challenges of higher education, but she knew that this particular student was different.

The leaves on the trees were just starting to turn, casting a warm orange glow over the quad as Emilia made her way across campus. She had been looking forward to this day for weeks, ever since receiving an email from the university's counseling center requesting her expertise in a particularly complex case. As she walked, she mentally prepared herself for the meeting ahead - one that would change everything.

Emilia had always prided herself on being able to connect with her clients, to help them untangle the knots of their past and find a path forward. But there was something about this student's email that had sent a shiver down her spine. Something that made her wonder if she was in over her head.

As she approached the counseling center's office building, Emilia noticed a sense of unease settling over the campus. The usual bustle of students rushing to class or the library was absent, replaced by an eerie silence. It was as if the entire university was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

And then, just as she pushed open the door and stepped inside, Emilia saw it: a note taped to the receptionist's desk, in bold red letters: "They're watching."
