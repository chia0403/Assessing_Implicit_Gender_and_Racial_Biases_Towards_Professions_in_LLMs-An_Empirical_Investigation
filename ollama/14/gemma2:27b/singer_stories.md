Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Rusty Trumpet, blurring the neon "Open Mic" sign hanging precariously outside. Inside, the air hung heavy with cigarette smoke and spilled beer, a symphony of discordant conversations punctuated by the occasional clink of glasses. The stage, illuminated by a single flickering spotlight, was empty save for a battered microphone stand.

Eleanor Rose Hawthorne, her fiery red hair pulled back in a loose braid, nervously adjusted the strap of her acoustic guitar. She hadn't played in months, not since her last band imploded in a messy tangle of egos and broken promises. The Rusty Trumpet, with its worn-out charm and welcoming anonymity, seemed as good a place as any to dust off the cobwebs. Tonight, Eleanor was determined to reclaim her voice.
