The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel hummed with an anticipatory energy. It was always like this on New Year's Eve, a delicious cocktail of champagne wishes and whispered resolutions swirling through the gilded lobby. Elodie Hawthorne, her crisp black uniform immaculate as ever, straightened the velvet ropes flanking the grand staircase, ensuring not a single wrinkle marred their scarlet perfection.  

Elodie prided herself on being invisible yet omnipresent. She was the quiet conductor orchestrating the symphony of guest requests: securing last-minute reservations at Michelin-starred restaurants, procuring rare vintages from the hotel's legendary cellar, even locating a lost teddy bear for a tearful five-year-old. Tonight, however, something felt different. A palpable tension crackled beneath the festive facade, like static electricity waiting to discharge.
