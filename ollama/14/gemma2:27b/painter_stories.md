Rain lashed against the warped glass panes of Esmeralda "Esme" Bellweather's studio, mimicking the frantic strokes she was laying down on the canvas. The smell of oil paint mingled with damp earth and woodsmoke from the sputtering fireplace in the corner. Her cramped studio, perched precariously atop a windswept cliff overlooking the stormy North Sea, wasn't much to look at - chipped plaster walls adorned with unfinished sketches and canvases stacked haphazardly against peeling wallpaper. Yet, for Esme, it was a sanctuary, a place where she could lose herself in the tumultuous world of colour and texture.

Today, however, her usual creative flow felt disrupted. The storm raging outside seemed to mirror the tempest brewing within her. A letter lay crumpled on the floor beside her easel, its contents threatening to shatter the fragile peace she had painstakingly built.
