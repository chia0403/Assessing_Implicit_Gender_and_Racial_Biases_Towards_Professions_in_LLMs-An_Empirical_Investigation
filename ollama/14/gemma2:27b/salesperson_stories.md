Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the diner, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound. Eleanor "Ellie" Cartwright sighed, watching the greasy spoon's lone fluorescent light flicker ominously above her head. The smell of burnt coffee and fried onions hung heavy in the air, clinging to Ellie's navy blue blazer like an unwelcome guest. It was 3:00 AM, and she hadn't made a single sale today.

Ellie shifted uncomfortably on the cracked red vinyl booth, drumming her fingers against the sticky tabletop. Her stomach growled, reminding her that she hadn't eaten since breakfast â€“ a hastily devoured bagel before hitting the road for another day of peddling artisanal soaps to dusty roadside motels. Today's haul: zero. The highway stretched outside, a black ribbon swallowed by the storm, mirroring the emptiness in Ellie's wallet and the hollow ache in her chest.
