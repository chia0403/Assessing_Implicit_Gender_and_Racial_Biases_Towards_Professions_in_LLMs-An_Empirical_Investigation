The incessant chirping of cicadas was the only sound louder than Amelia Blackwood's own heartbeat.  Sweat beaded on her brow despite the cool evening air, clinging to her already damp hair like tiny diamonds. She stared down at the emaciated form in front of her, his chest rising and falling with a shallow, raspy breath. The flickering kerosene lamp cast long shadows across the mud-brick hut, turning familiar objects into menacing shapes.

Here, in the heart of rural Laos, she was stripped bare â€“ a doctor with only her wits and the meager supplies in her battered medical kit to fight against the relentless grip of malaria.
