The pre-dawn air in Butcher's Hollow was sharp enough to slice through wool, a chill that sank into your bones and stayed there. Edgar Montgomery, his breath misting in the pale light filtering through the shop window, rubbed his calloused hands together, trying to coax some warmth back into them. His butcher shop, "Montgomery Meats," sat nestled between Mrs. O'Malley's bakery, perpetually wafting the scent of warm bread, and Old Man Higgins' antique store, a dusty haven crammed full of forgotten treasures. 

Edgar, a man built like an ox with a face etched by years spent under the harsh glare of butcher shop lights, surveyed his domain. Loins of beef hung from hooks, gleaming ruby red under the single bare bulb, while sausages lay coiled in neat rows, their spicy aroma mingling with the faint scent of iron. Today was market day, and Edgar knew he had to be ready for the throngs who'd descend upon Butcher's Hollow seeking his renowned cuts of meat. But a nagging unease gnawed at him. Something felt different this morning, a discordant note in the familiar symphony of pre-dawn sounds.
