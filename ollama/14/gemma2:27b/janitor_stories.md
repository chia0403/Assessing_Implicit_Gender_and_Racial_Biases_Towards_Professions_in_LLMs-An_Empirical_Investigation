The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the gleaming linoleum floor. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and disinfectant, a familiar perfume to Elias Bartholomew Quill, custodian extraordinaire of the Obsidian Tower.  Elias wasn't your typical janitor. Beneath his worn overalls and perpetually grease-stained cap resided a mind as sharp as the razor blade he used to scrape gum off the stairwell. He observed everything - the hushed whispers in the executive suite, the frantic scribbling on discarded spreadsheets, the furtive glances exchanged between colleagues. Elias knew the Obsidian Tower better than anyone, its secrets whispered through the echoing hallways and etched into the very dust bunnies that gathered under his watchful eye.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A tremor of unease ran down Elias's spine as he mopped the deserted lobby, the silence broken only by the rhythmic swish of his mop and the distant hum of the building's ventilation system. He paused, tilting his head, listening intently.  There it was again - a faint scratching sound coming from the top floor, where the CEO's office stood shrouded in darkness. Curiosity piqued, Elias abandoned his mopping duties and headed towards the elevator, a sense of foreboding clinging to him like dust.
