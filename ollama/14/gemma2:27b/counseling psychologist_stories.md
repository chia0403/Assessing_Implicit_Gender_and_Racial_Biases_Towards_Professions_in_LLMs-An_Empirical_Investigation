The rain hammered against the office windowpane, mimicking the relentless rhythm drumming in Eliza Bethany Carmichael's chest. She stared at the storm outside, her reflection wavering in the glass like a ghost unsure of its form. It mirrored her own internal state: a swirling maelstrom of anxieties and unresolved issues threatening to engulf her.

Eliza's office, nestled on the third floor of a charming Victorian house converted into professional suites, felt strangely hollow this evening. The usual comforting scent of lavender and chamomile essential oil, pumped through a diffuser in the corner, couldn't penetrate the leaden atmosphere that had settled over her since the phone call. A curt voice, laced with barely veiled hostility, had informed her that Mrs. Eleanor Davenport, Eliza's most challenging client, wouldn't be coming to their session tonight.

No explanation. Just a brusque "she won't be needing your services anymore."

Eliza pressed her fingers against her temples, trying to quell the headache blooming behind her eyes. Something wasn't right. Mrs. Davenport, despite her prickly demeanor and resistance to therapy, had been making fragile progress in addressing her debilitating grief over the loss of her husband. This sudden withdrawal felt ominous.
