Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Blackwood’s cramped studio apartment, blurring the neon glow of the city skyline into an impressionistic smear.  The scent of damp plaster and stale coffee hung heavy in the air. Elias, his dark hair perpetually tousled, sat hunched over his editing desk, the pale light of the monitor reflecting in his hazel eyes.

He was wrestling with a series of photographs he’d taken at the abandoned amusement park on the city's outskirts – a place where rusting roller coasters clawed at the sky and faded laughter echoed in the ghostly stillness.  Elias felt a pull towards forgotten spaces, places where time seemed to stand still, whispering stories of what once was. His camera became his tool for capturing these echoes, preserving them in stark black and white.

But tonight, something felt off. The usual sense of satisfaction he derived from his work was missing. He stared at the image on the screen – a carousel horse frozen mid-leap, its painted smile eerily vacant – and a shiver ran down his spine.  There was something unsettling about this photograph, a hidden darkness lurking beneath the surface.
