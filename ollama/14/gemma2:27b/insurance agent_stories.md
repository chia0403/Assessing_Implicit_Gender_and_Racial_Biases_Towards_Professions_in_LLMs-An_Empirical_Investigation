Rain lashed against the windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quincy's cramped office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in his chest. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the neon glow of the insurance agency sign flickered erratically, casting long, menacing shadows across the rain-slicked asphalt. Bart nervously adjusted his tie, a garish purple paisley number he'd inherited from his eccentric Uncle Earl.

It was his first week on the job at "Quincy & Sons Insurance," a family business inherited from his late father. Bart wasn't cut out for this world of spreadsheets and actuarial tables. He longed to be outdoors, hiking in the mountains or kayaking down wild rivers â€“ anything but confined to this stuffy office selling life insurance to people who looked like they already had enough of it.

Today was different though. Today, a potential client, Ms. Eleanor Blackwood, was coming in for a consultation. Rumor had it she was wealthy, eccentric, and possibly even haunted by the ghost of her late husband. Bart felt a shiver crawl down his spine despite the stifling heat from the ancient radiator hissing in the corner. This wasn't just another policy. This could be his ticket out of this dreary existence.
