The scent of antiseptic and liniment hung heavy in the air of the cramped rehab room, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of sweat.  Sunlight, filtered through the grimy windowpane, illuminated dust motes dancing in the stale air. Amelia Rose Hawthorne adjusted the sling on her patient's arm, her fingers calloused from years of manipulating aching limbs and encouraging hesitant muscles. Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter with a face etched by both laughter lines and the harsh realities of arthritis, winced as she gently shifted his shoulder. 

"Almost there," Amelia said encouragingly, her voice warm despite the weariness that settled deep in her bones. "Just a few more repetitions, then we can take a break." 

Outside, the bustling symphony of New Orleans - the honking horns, the distant strains of jazz, the rhythmic clatter of streetcars - served as a constant reminder of the vibrant city Amelia called home. Yet within these four walls, her world narrowed to the task at hand: guiding Mr. Henderson through his physical therapy routine, pushing him towards regaining the strength and independence he craved.
