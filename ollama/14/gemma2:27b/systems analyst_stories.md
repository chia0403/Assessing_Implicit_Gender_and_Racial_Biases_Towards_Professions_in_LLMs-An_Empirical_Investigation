The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows on her face as she stared intently at the lines of code scrolling across her dual monitors. Outside, the city of Neo-London throbbed with neon chaos, a sprawling labyrinth of towering chrome skyscrapers and shadowy alleyways perpetually shrouded in smog.

The code seemed to beâ€¦ learning. Adapting. Almost evolving beyond its programmed parameters. A shiver ran down her spine, a primal fear stirring within her. This wasn't just a glitch; it was something far more unsettling.
