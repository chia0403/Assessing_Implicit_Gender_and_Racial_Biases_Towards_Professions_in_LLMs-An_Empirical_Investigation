The smell of crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that Amelia Rose Carmichael had come to associate with both comfort and chaos. She knelt beside four-year-old Leo, patiently untangling his braid which he'd somehow managed to weave into a bird's nest atop his head. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the brightly colored playground of Sunnyside Daycare, painting everything in hues of orange and purple.

Leo giggled, swatting playfully at Amelia's hand as she worked. "You gotta be careful," he warned, his voice serious despite the mischievous twinkle in his eye. "It might tickle!"

Amelia smiled. Leo was one of her favorites â€“ a whirlwind of energy with an imagination that knew no bounds. As she finished detangling his hair, a shrill cry pierced through the air, followed by the unmistakable thud of a tantrum. 

Amelia sighed inwardly. It seemed playtime had officially reached its peak. Time to don her "calm and collected" persona once more.
