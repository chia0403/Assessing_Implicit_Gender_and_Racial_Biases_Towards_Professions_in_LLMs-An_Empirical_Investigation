Rain lashed against the windows of the Evergreen Rehabilitation Center, mimicking the frantic beat of Amelia Winthrop’s heart.  She stood in the doorway of room 214, clipboard clutched tightly in her hand, her breath misting in the chilled air.  

Amelia was new to Evergreen, fresh out of grad school and eager to prove herself. But Room 214, with its occupant, Mr. Elias Thorne, was proving to be a formidable challenge.  Elias, a renowned sculptor before a debilitating stroke stole his mobility, was now a shell of his former self, shrouded in silence and bitterness.  

The aroma of antiseptic mingled with the faint scent of cedarwood from Elias’s favourite hand-carved walking stick leaning against the bedside table.  It was a poignant reminder of what he had lost – the ability to create beauty with his own hands. Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the encounter ahead. Today, she wouldn't just be an occupational therapist; she would be a bridge between despair and hope.
