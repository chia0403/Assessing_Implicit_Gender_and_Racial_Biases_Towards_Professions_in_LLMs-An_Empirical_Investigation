The rhythmic rasp of Elara Finch's drafting pen against vellum was a constant in her life. A familiar hum nestled amongst the clatter of typewriters and the distant clang of machinery from the factory floor below. The cramped drafting room, tucked away on the fourth floor of the Blackwood Manufacturing building, smelled faintly of ink, stale coffee, and the ever-present dust that seemed to cling to everything in this aging structure. Outside her grimy window, the industrial sprawl of 1920s Chicago stretched endlessly, a tapestry woven from brick chimneys spewing smoke and towering factories churning out products unknown. But Elara's gaze rarely strayed beyond the intricate lines and precise measurements that danced across her drafting table. For her, the world existed within the confines of these blueprints, where gears, pistons, and levers took shape under her steady hand.

Today, however, a prickling unease disturbed her usual focus. A stack of fresh blueprints sat untouched on her desk, their edges crisp and promising. Yet, Elara found herself staring blankly at them, the weight of unspoken whispers settling upon her shoulders. Something was amiss in the factory below, something more sinister than the everyday grind and clangor.  

The rumors had been swirling for weeks: hushed conversations about accidents, unexplained malfunctions, and a growing sense of dread amongst the workers. Elara, however, dismissed them as mere anxieties born from the relentless pace of production. But now, as she listened to the muffled cries and frantic footsteps echoing from below, her heart pounded with an icy certainty â€“ something was terribly wrong.
