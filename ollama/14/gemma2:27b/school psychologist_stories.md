The flickering fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the stacks of files on Dr. Evelyn Sinclairâ€™s desk. The air in her windowless office at Willow Creek High School smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, a scent familiar to any school psychologist worth their salt. Outside, autumn leaves swirled in a riot of color, painting the world beyond the concrete walls with a beauty Evelyn couldn't quite access.  

Today, however, was no ordinary Thursday. The weight of anticipation hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the incessant ticking of the old clock on her wall. A new student, Liam Hayes, was arriving for his first session. His file, thicker than most, spoke of a troubled past and a mind shrouded in mystery. Evelyn had poured over it for hours, desperate to glean any insight that might help her navigate this complex young man's inner world.
