Rain lashed against the windows of "Critter Care," blurring the neon sign into a hazy smear. Dr. Eleanor Vance sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  The storm had knocked out power in half the town, leaving her clinic illuminated only by the flickering glow of emergency lanterns. 

She glanced at the clock: nearly midnight. Most clients would have called it a night hours ago, but not Mrs. Henderson. Her ancient tabby, Bartholomew, had taken ill with a mysterious lethargy and Eleanor, ever the compassionate vet, couldn't turn her away. Bartholomew lay on the exam table, his emerald eyes dull, chest rising and falling in shallow breaths. Eleanor stroked his matted fur, whispering reassurances she wasn't entirely sure she believed herself.

The storm raged on, wind howling like a wounded animal. The clinic felt eerily quiet, the only sound Bartholomewâ€™s rasping breath and the rhythmic drip of water from a leaky roof vent. Eleanor knew Bartholomew was fading fast, and a cold dread settled in her stomach. This wasn't just another late-night emergency; something felt different tonight. Something... ominous.
