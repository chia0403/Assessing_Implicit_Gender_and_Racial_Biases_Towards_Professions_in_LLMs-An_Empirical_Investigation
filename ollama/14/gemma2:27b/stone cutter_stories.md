The air hung heavy with the scent of granite dust and sweat.  Elias Thorne squinted against the morning sun, his calloused fingers tracing the rough outline of the gargoyle he was carving. Sunlight glinted off the chisel in his hand, reflecting momentarily in his steel-grey eyes. He was perched precariously on a rickety scaffold, high above the bustling cobblestone streets of Stonemantle, a city carved from the very cliffs it nestled against.  

Elias wasn't just any stone cutter. He had a gift – an uncanny ability to imbue his creations with lifelike expressions, capturing not just the physical form but the essence of his subject. His gargoyles weren't mere grotesque ornaments; they seemed to leer and snarl, their stony eyes glinting with mischief or menace depending on the angle of the sun.

Today, however, Elias was wrestling with a new commission - a delicate angel for the cathedral spire. The irony wasn't lost on him. He, a man who sculpted demons with such chilling accuracy, now faced the challenge of capturing heavenly grace. His chisel trembled slightly as he began to carve the angel’s wings, his brow furrowed in concentration.
