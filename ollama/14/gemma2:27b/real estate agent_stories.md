Rain lashed against the windows of Elara Sinclair's tiny office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in her chest. Outside, Portland shimmered under a perpetual twilight sky, streetlamps struggling to pierce the gloom. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and distant wood smoke. Elara nervously adjusted the chipped paint on her desk, her eyes darting between the overflowing inbox and the phone that stubbornly remained silent.

This wasn't how she envisioned her real estate career starting. Fresh out of college, brimming with optimism and armed with a degree in urban planning, Elara had dreamed of guiding families to their forever homes, helping them envision futures within the charming Victorian houses and modern lofts that dotted Portland's eclectic landscape. Instead, she was battling a sluggish market, dwindling savings, and the creeping fear that her dream was slipping away like the rain down the windowpane.
