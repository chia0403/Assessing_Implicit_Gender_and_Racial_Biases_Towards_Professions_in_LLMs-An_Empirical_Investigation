Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Cavendish's practice, blurring the lights of the quiet suburban street into an impressionist painting. The insistent drumming mirrored the pounding in Elias’s chest. He stared at his reflection in the polished stainless steel instruments laid out on the tray – a man with tired eyes framed by greying hair and a hesitant smile perpetually etched onto his face. His hands, usually steady and precise when probing molars and shaping crowns, trembled slightly. 

Today was different. Today wasn't about fixing chipped teeth or easing aching gums. Today, Elias Cavendish had to confront the ghost of a past he thought he’d buried deep beneath years of meticulous routine and forced cheerfulness.
