Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Earl Montgomery's workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of rust-tinged water. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of damp earth and Earl's ever-present pipe tobacco. He hunched over his workbench, grease staining his calloused hands as he meticulously reassembled a temperamental faucet. A symphony of clangs and thuds punctuated the relentless drumming of the rain, a familiar soundtrack to Earl's solitary existence.

His workshop, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Oakhaven, was a testament to years spent wrestling with leaky pipes and clogged drains. Tools of every conceivable shape and size hung from pegboards, their worn handles whispering tales of countless repairs. A faded photograph of a grinning young woman perched on a shelf, her eyes sparkling with an unspoken promise - a reminder of the life Earl had left behind.

The phone jangled, its shrill ring momentarily piercing the rhythm of the storm. Earl wiped his hands on a rag, his heart sinking as he recognized the caller ID. It was Mrs. Hawthorne again, and judging by the frantic tone of her voice, another plumbing emergency awaited him in the depths of Oakhaven's oldest mansion.  Earl sighed, knowing that tonight's already dismal dinner plans were about to be flushed away...literally.
