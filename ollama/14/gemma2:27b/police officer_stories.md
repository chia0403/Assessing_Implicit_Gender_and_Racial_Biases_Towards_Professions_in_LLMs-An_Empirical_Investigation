Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The stale scent of coffee and yesterday's takeout hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the chaos that was her life. Outside, the neon glow of the 'Last Chance Saloon' across the street pulsed like a sickly heartbeat, casting long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked pavement. Izzy stared at the flickering light, her reflection momentarily superimposed on the grimy glass â€“ tired eyes, a sharp jawline shadowed with stubble, and a tangled mess of dark curls threatening to escape its confines. 

Tonight was supposed to be her night off. Instead, she found herself staring down another cold case: the disappearance of young Sarah Miller, vanished without a trace five years ago.
