A gust of wind, thick with the scent of brine and decaying seaweed, swept past him, carrying whispers from the churning waves beyond the crumbling stone wall.

Thaddeus stood at the threshold of Grimhaven Penitentiary, a monolithic fortress perched precariously on the edge of a jagged cliff overlooking the unforgiving North Sea. Its silhouette, etched against the bruised twilight sky, resembled a skeletal hand reaching out to grasp the stormy heavens. The prison itself was a labyrinthine structure of damp, moss-covered stone, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at the turbulent world beyond.

For five years, Thaddeus had been tasked with guarding Grimhaven's most notorious inmates: criminals, pirates, and sorcerers condemned for crimes against humanity.  He walked his beat with the weary gait of a man burdened by unseen horrors, his hand never straying far from the hilt of his sword. Tonight, however, a chilling premonition gnawed at him, an unsettling feeling that something wicked was about to stir within Grimhaven's ancient walls.
