Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. The file lay open on her mahogany desk, the stark black-and-white photograph staring up at her: a young woman, eyes wide with terror frozen in time.  This was Amelia Croft, victim number three. Three seemingly random killings in as many months, each leaving behind a cryptic note scrawled on a piece of parchment: "The Raven demands his due." 

Eleanor's office, nestled in the heart of Boston's Back Bay, was a sanctuary she usually found solace in.  Bookshelves lined the walls, crammed with weighty tomes on criminal psychology and forensic analysis. A worn leather armchair sat opposite her desk, inviting weary souls to confide their darkest secrets. But today, the familiar comfort offered no respite. The Raven was playing a deadly game, and Eleanor, a respected expert in profiling serial killers, felt an unnerving responsibility to stop him.
