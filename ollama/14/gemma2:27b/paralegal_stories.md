The incessant hum of the copy machine was Amelia Blackwood’s unwelcome morning alarm clock.  She rubbed sleep from her eyes, the fluorescent lights of the law firm's break room already buzzing aggressively overhead. Coffee, strong and black, was her only solace in this sterile space. Papers overflowed from her messenger bag, threatening to spill onto the linoleum floor. Today was going to be a long one - depositions all morning for the Henderson case, followed by research on obscure property rights for the afternoon.  

Amelia, a paralegal at Pierce & Sterling for five years running, yearned for something more than endless paperwork and coffee-fueled deadlines. She dreamt of dusty libraries, forgotten archives, uncovering hidden truths - anything but this beige cubicle life.


The Henderson case was a messy divorce, rife with accusations and bitter resentments. Amelia could practically smell the tension radiating from her clients as they glared at each other across the conference table.  

Little did she know, the Henderson case held a secret that would shatter her mundane existence and plunge her into a world far more thrilling – and dangerous – than she ever imagined.
