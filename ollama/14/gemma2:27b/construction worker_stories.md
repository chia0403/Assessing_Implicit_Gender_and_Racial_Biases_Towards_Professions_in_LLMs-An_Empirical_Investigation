The midday sun beat down on Elias “Eli” Mendoza’s broad shoulders, turning his sweat-soaked shirt into a second skin. Dust devils danced across the barren landscape, swirling around half-constructed buildings that resembled skeletal giants reaching for a sky choked with smog. Eli wiped a greasy hand across his brow, leaving a streak of grime in its wake. He squinted at the blueprints spread out on a rickety table nearby, the harsh lines blurring together under the relentless glare.

The city of Nueva Esperanza was a monument to ambition and despair. A sprawling metropolis rising from the ashes of a long-forgotten catastrophe, it promised a fresh start for those brave enough to carve their own destiny from the unforgiving desert. But beneath the gleaming facade of progress lay a brutal reality: endless work, meager wages, and a constant struggle for survival.

Eli, with his calloused hands and unwavering determination, was one of the city's unsung heroes, building its future brick by grueling brick. Yet, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was caught in a never-ending loop, forever chasing a mirage on the horizon. Today, though, something felt different. A tremor ran through him, a subtle shift in the air, as if fate itself was about to deal a new hand.
