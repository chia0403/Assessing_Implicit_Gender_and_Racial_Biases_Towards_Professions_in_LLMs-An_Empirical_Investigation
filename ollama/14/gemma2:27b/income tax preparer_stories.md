April 15th loomed, casting its annual shadow of dread over Bernie's small tax preparation office nestled on a dusty corner lot in the fading industrial town of Willow Creek. Outside, the wind howled through skeletal trees lining the street, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Bernie. This year felt different. Heavier. 


Bernie tapped her pen nervously against a stack of forms labelled "Schedule C: Profit or Loss From Business." Each one represented a dream, a gamble, a struggle for survival in this forgotten corner of the world. She knew their stories, their hopes and fears, scribbled between the lines of income and expenses. This year, though, something felt off. A recurring discrepancy, a phantom number, kept appearing in her calculations. It was small, almost negligible, but it gnawed at Bernie's conscience like a persistent rat.
