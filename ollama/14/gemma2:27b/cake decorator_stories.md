The humid Georgia air clung to Elara Cartwright like a second skin as she wrestled with a five-tiered wedding cake monstrosity.  Sunlight streamed through the grimy window of her cramped bakery kitchen, illuminating a scene of sugary chaos. Flour dusted every surface, and buttercream swirls adorned her apron like abstract art. 

Elara scowled at the lopsided tier in front of her. This was supposed to be a masterpiece, a cascading waterfall of sugar flowers and delicate lacework. Instead, it resembled a melting glacier sculpted by a toddler with ADHD.  

She sighed, wiping a stray bead of sweat from her brow. The aroma of vanilla and almond hung heavy in the air, momentarily distracting her from the impending disaster. This wedding was for the mayor's daughter â€“ no pressure, right? Elara needed this contract to keep her fledgling bakery afloat, but she couldn't shake the feeling that her artistic vision had gone rogue.  

Maybe it was the heat, or maybe it was the constant reminder of her dwindling savings, but doubt gnawed at her confidence. Could she pull this off?
