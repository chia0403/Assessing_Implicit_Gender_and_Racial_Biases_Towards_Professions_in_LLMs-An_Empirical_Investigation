Dawn painted the cobblestone street outside her bakery window in hues of rose gold, while inside, the ovens hummed like contented beasts, churning out loaves of sourdough still warm from their slumber.  Elara dusted flour onto her apron, a sprinkle of magic against the mundane, and surveyed her domain: trays piled high with croissants begging to be devoured, glazed doughnuts glistening like jewels, and an impressive tower of pain au chocolat that seemed to defy gravity.

Perhaps it was the strange raven that had perched itself on the windowsill, its obsidian eyes glinting with an unsettling intelligence. Or maybe it was the cryptic note tucked beneath her doormat: "The oven holds more than heat."
