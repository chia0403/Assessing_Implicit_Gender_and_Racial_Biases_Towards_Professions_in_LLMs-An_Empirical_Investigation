Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Blackwood's office, mimicking the chaotic storm brewing inside her chest. The stale scent of disinfectant mingled with teenage angst and desperation – a familiar cocktail in her twenty years as Willow Creek High School's guidance counselor. Outside, the late autumn wind whipped fallen leaves into frenzied dances. Inside, Eleanor stared at the crumpled college application clutched in her hand, its pristine surface now marred by tear stains.

It belonged to Liam Walker, a quiet, introspective senior whose dreams seemed to be crumbling faster than the crumbling facade of the old gymnasium across the street.  Eleanor knew Liam well – she'd watched him blossom from a shy freshman into a young man with hidden depths and a passion for marine biology.  But his application essay, usually a window into a student's soul, was blank. Empty. A stark reflection of the crushing weight Liam carried.
