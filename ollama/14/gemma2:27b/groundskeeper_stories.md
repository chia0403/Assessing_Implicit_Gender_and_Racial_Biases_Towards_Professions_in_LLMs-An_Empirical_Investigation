Rain lashed against Silas Blackwood's weathered face, each drop an icy needle piercing his skin. He tugged his worn cap lower, shielding his eyes from the relentless downpour as he surveyed the ravaged gardens of Thornhill Manor.  Autumn leaves, once vibrant crimson and gold, were now sodden masses clinging limply to their branches. The meticulously sculpted topiaries resembled misshapen monsters, dripping with water and twisted by the wind. 

Silas sighed, a gust of wind stealing his breath away. For thirty years he had tended these gardens, coaxing life from the earth and sculpting beauty from untamed wilderness. But today, Thornhill Manor felt less like a sanctuary and more like a forgotten tomb, its grandeur shrouded in a veil of melancholy.
