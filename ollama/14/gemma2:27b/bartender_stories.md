Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of The Rusty Nail, blurring the neon sign outside into a feverish smear of red and green. Inside, the air was thick with cigarette smoke and the tang of stale beer.  Jasper "Jazz" Delaney, his salt-and-pepper beard dusted with sawdust from polishing glasses, surveyed his domain. It wasn't much - just a dimly lit bar nestled in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter - but it was Jazz's sanctuary. He knew every creak of the floorboards, every faded inscription on the walls, every crack in the worn leather stools that lined the counter.  Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced down his spine as a figure pushed open the heavy oak door, letting in a gust of wind and rain that briefly extinguished the single flickering bulb above the entrance. 

The newcomer was shrouded in shadow, their face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat. They moved with an almost predatory grace, their steps silent despite the downpour raging outside. Jazz's hand instinctively reached for the well-worn baseball bat hidden beneath the counter - a habit he'd picked up after years of dealing with drunks and troublemakers. He knew better than to judge a book by its cover, but something about this stranger set his nerves on edge.
