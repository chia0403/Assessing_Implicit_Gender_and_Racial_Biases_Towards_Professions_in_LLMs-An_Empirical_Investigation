Grease stained his hands permanently it seemed, even after countless washes with industrial soap.  Elias "Eli" Vargas squinted at the engine beneath him, the fluorescent light in his cramped garage casting harsh shadows across the labyrinthine network of hoses and wires. The familiar scent of gasoline and oil filled the air, a comforting aroma to Eli, who had spent more time under car hoods than anywhere else.

He was working on a beat-up '67 Mustang, its cherry red paint faded and chipped, but still holding onto a glimmer of its former glory.  The owner, a young woman named Clara with eyes the color of jade, was desperately hoping to have it running for her grandmother's 80th birthday celebration.

Outside, the sun beat down on the dusty Arizona town of Mesa Verde, the heat radiating off the asphalt and baking the metal roofs of nearby buildings. Eli wiped his brow with the back of his grease-smudged hand, a sigh escaping his lips. This engine was giving him more trouble than he anticipated.
