The aroma of burnt coffee and desperation hung heavy in Emilia Blackwood's tiny studio apartment. Outside, the relentless hum of the city pressed against her windows like an impatient crowd. Rain lashed down, blurring the neon glow of the billboards across the street into streaks of impossible colour.  Emilia stared at the blinking cursor on her screen, a mocking reminder of the deadline looming over her head. The logo design for "Cosmic Ketchup," a new gourmet condiment promising "a taste sensation from beyond the stars," remained stubbornly unfinished.

She chewed on her thumbnail, frustration gnawing at her. Usually, inspiration struck Emilia like lightning, illuminating a concept in a flash. But this time, her creative well had run dry. How do you capture the essence of ketchup... in space?
