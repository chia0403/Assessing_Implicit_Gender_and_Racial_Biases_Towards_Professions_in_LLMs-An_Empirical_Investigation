Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, blurring the cityscape into a watercolour smear of grey and gold. Inside, the lobby hummed with hushed conversations and the clatter of suitcases on marble floors. Elodie Beaumont, perched behind her mahogany desk like a porcelain figurine come to life, watched the storm unfold with a detached amusement. 

Elodie wasn't fazed by the drama nature often unleashed upon the city. She'd seen it all in her five years at the Grand Blackwood: honeymoons gone sour, business deals collapsing, and even the occasional disappearance. Today, however, felt different. A prickling sensation ran up Elodie's spine, a sixth sense whispering that something extraordinary was about to happen.  

Just then, the ornate double doors swung open with a theatrical whoosh, admitting a figure cloaked in shadow. Elodie straightened in her chair, curiosity piqued. This wasn't your average weary traveller seeking refuge from the storm.
