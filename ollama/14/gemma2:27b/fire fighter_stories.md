Smoke stung Elias Thorne's nostrils, acrid and thick enough to taste. The roar of the flames was a living beast, consuming everything in its path. He gripped the hose tighter, his knuckles white against the worn rubber. Above him, the three-story Victorian mansion groaned under the inferno's assault, windows shattered like fallen stars. 

Elias had seen countless fires in his ten years on the force, but this one felt different. A gnawing unease tightened in his chest as he surveyed the scene. The flames were hungry, relentless, and strangely unnatural in their intensity. This wasn't just a house fire; it was something more sinister, something that whispered of forgotten dangers and ancient curses. 

He glanced at his crewmates battling the blaze beside him - faces grim, sweat dripping down their foreheads. They were veterans, tough and fearless, but even they seemed unnerved by the inferno's unyielding fury.
