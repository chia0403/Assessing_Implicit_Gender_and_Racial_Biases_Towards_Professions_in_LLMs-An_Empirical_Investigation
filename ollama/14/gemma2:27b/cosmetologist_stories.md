The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and burnt hairspray, a familiar perfume in Celeste Amara's world. Outside her salon window, rain lashed against the glass, blurring the neon glow of the "Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow" sign.  Inside, however, it was warm and bustling. The rhythmic snip-snip of shears mingled with the low hum of dryers and the animated chatter of her clients. Celeste, a woman whose own fiery red curls mirrored the passion she poured into her work, expertly maneuvered through the chaos. 

She was known in the small town of Bellhaven for her magical touch – transforming drab to fab, mending split ends, and weaving dreams into hairstyles. But today, something felt off. A knot of unease tightened in Celeste's chest, a feeling she couldn’t shake as she reached for her latest client's hair dye.  The rain outside seemed to intensify, mirroring the storm brewing within her.
