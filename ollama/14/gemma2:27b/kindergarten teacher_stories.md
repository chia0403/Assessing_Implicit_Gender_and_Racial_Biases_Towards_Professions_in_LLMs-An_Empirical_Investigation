The crayon sun, hastily scribbled by five-year-old Liam, hung lopsidedly on the window, casting a garish orange glow across Miss Amelia Brighton's meticulously organized classroom. Outside, the real sun was just beginning to peek over the horizon, painting the sky with soft pinks and yellows. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the ancient oak tree outside the window, sending a cascade of crimson leaves spiraling down onto the playground below.

Amelia hummed softly as she straightened the alphabet rug, her fingers tracing the familiar curves of each letter. Today was Show and Tell day, always a chaotic but heartwarming affair filled with teddy bears missing an eye, lopsided drawings, and enthusiastic pronouncements about beloved pets. A smile touched Amelia's lips as she thought of the precious treasures her students would bring to share.
