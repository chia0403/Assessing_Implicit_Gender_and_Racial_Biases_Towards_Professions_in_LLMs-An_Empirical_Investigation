Rain lashed against the windows of "Smiles for Miles" Dental Clinic, blurring the neon sign into a psychedelic swirl. Inside, Eloise Amelia Davenport meticulously polished a set of dentures, her brow furrowed in concentration. The rhythmic swish-swish of her hand against the porcelain was the only sound breaking the tense silence.  Eloise wasn't usually bothered by bad weather – she found its grey melancholy strangely comforting – but today, something felt off. The air hung heavy with unspoken tension, a feeling that prickled at the back of her neck like static electricity.

It had started earlier that morning, when Dr. Albright arrived looking unusually flustered. He'd muttered something about "a complicated case" and spent most of the day huddled in his office, whispering urgently on the phone. Eloise hadn't pried – she respected Dr. Albright's privacy – but curiosity gnawed at her. What could possibly be so important to rattle the usually unflappable dentist?
