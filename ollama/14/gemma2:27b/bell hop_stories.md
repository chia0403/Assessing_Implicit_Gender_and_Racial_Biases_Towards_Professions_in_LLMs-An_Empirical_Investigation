The Grand Blackwood Hotel hummed with an energy only a place overflowing with secrets could possess. Its polished marble floors reflected the flickering gaslights overhead, casting long shadows that danced with every passing guest. Reginald "Reg" Alistair Finchworth III, his crisp bellhop uniform straining against his lanky frame, weaved through the opulent lobby with practiced ease. The scent of lilies and beeswax hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of cigar smoke wafting from the Gentleman's Lounge. Reg, however, smelled only trouble brewing.

He'd been a bellhop at the Grand Blackwood for five years, long enough to recognize the subtle shifts in the atmosphere. Tonight, it crackled with something unsettling, like the prelude to a storm. A renowned scientist had arrived that afternoon, whispers of his revolutionary invention preceding him. Reg had glimpsed the man briefly - gaunt, intense eyes behind wire-rimmed spectacles, clutching a battered leather briefcase as if it contained the world's greatest treasure.

And then there was Lady Cavendish, her icy blue gaze fixed on everyone and everything with unnerving intensity. Her arrival, accompanied by an entourage of nervous servants, had stirred up gossip amongst the staff. Everyone knew Lady Cavendish had a penchant for acquiring rare artifacts, often employing dubious methods. 


Reg adjusted his bellhop cap, steeling himself for the night ahead. He sensed that something extraordinary - perhaps even dangerous - was about to unfold within the Grand Blackwood's gilded walls.
