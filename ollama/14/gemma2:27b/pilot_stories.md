The rusty scent of jet fuel hung heavy in the air, mingling with the brine tang of the nearby ocean. Amelia "Ace" Ramirez adjusted her headset, the worn leather soft against her cheek. She squinted at the battered Cessna 172 before her, its faded blue paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  

It wasn't glamorous, this life. No sleek corporate jets or first-class cabins for Ace. Her domain was the rugged coastline of Baja California, ferrying supplies to remote fishing villages nestled between craggy cliffs and turquoise waters. Today's cargo: a crate of medicine and a few precious sacks of fresh produce destined for San Juan de la Cruz, a village accessible only by air or sea.
