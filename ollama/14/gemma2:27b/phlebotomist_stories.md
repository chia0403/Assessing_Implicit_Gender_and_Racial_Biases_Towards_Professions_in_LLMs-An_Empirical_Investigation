The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda Flores like a chorus of agitated bees. Their cold glare reflected off the polished stainless steel countertop, making it gleam ominously.  Esmeralda sighed, adjusting her ID badge and smoothing down the wrinkles in her crisp blue scrubs. The waiting room was sparsely populated: an elderly woman clutching a well-worn Bible, a young man nervously tapping his foot, and a toddler wailing piteously from behind a half-drawn curtain.

It was another Tuesday morning at Mercy General Hospital’s outpatient lab – a day Esmeralda had come to dread. Not because of the work itself, which she found strangely calming, but because Tuesdays were always the busiest. The sheer volume of bloodwork requested felt overwhelming, like an endless tide crashing against the shores of her tired mind. 

But today was different. Today, something hummed beneath the surface of the usual Tuesday chaos. A prickling sensation danced on Esmeralda’s skin, a feeling that she couldn't quite place. Something big was brewing, she could sense it.
