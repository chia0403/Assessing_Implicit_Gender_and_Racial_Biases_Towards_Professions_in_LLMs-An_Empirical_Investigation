The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck, turning his skin to leather. The scent of hot tar mingled with the acrid smell of sweat, clinging to him like a second skin. Below him, Detroit sprawled out in a patchwork of rusting steel and decaying brick, a symphony of sirens and honking horns providing the soundtrack to his workday. Silas adjusted the brim of his weathered cap, squinting at the warped shingles he was replacing on the roof of a crumbling Victorian townhouse. He'd seen better days, both the house and himself, but there was a grim satisfaction in the honest work, in bringing order to chaos, one shingle at a time. 

Today, however, something felt off. A prickling sensation danced along his spine, an unsettling feeling of being watched. The wind whispered through the rusted gutters, carrying with it a strange scent – metallic, sharp, like blood and ozone. Silas paused, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow, scanning the street below. Everything seemed normal: a stray dog sniffing at garbage cans, a young boy chasing pigeons across the park, an old woman shuffling slowly down the sidewalk, her head bowed beneath a shawl.  

But the feeling persisted, intensifying with every passing moment. This wasn't just paranoia; something was amiss, something he couldn't quite put his finger on. And then he saw it – a flicker of movement in the window across the street, a shadow momentarily obscuring the grimy glass. Silas froze, his heart pounding against his ribs. The shadow vanished as quickly as it appeared, leaving him staring at the empty windowpane, wondering if he'd imagined it all.
