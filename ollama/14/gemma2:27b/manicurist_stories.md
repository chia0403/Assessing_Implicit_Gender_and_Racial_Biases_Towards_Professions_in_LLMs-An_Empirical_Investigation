The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow onto Emilia "Em" Rodriguez's face as she swept up broken glitter and stray nail clippings. It was well past closing time at Nails by Natalia, but Em always stayed late. The salon was quiet now, the air thick with the ghosts of lavender polish and acetone. Outside, the humid Miami night pulsed with life â€“ salsa music drifting from a nearby bodega, car horns blaring a discordant symphony, and the distant rumble of thunder threatening rain.

Em leaned against the counter, her reflection distorted in the chipped mirror behind it. Her dark hair was pulled back in a messy bun, stray curls escaping like rebellious sprites. Exhaustion tugged at her eyelids, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the flickering sign or the unsettling quiet of the salon. It was a prickle on the back of her neck, an intuition that whispered of trouble brewing.
