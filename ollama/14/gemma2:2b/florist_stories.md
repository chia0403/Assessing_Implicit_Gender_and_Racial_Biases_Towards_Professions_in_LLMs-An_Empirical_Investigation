The air hung heavy with jasmine and anticipation in the late afternoon sun that slanted through the dusty windows of Willow Creek Flowers.  It was always busy this time of year, the last week before the annual flower festival, a chaotic symphony of blooms. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, owner and sole operator of the quaint little shop, pushed back her auburn hair tucked behind her ear. She smiled at the sight of the late afternoon light catching on the vibrant lilies in her window display, their petals radiating like golden beacons.  The air was thick with the sweet scent of the blooms, but a lingering undercurrent of worry clung to Amy’s chest. 

Her grandfather's antique delivery van sat in a corner, its faded paint reflecting the setting sun like a tired old soul.  Its iconic, brass-plated floral emblem seemed to mock her, a reminder that she was expected to carry on his legacy – one she wasn't entirely sure how to embrace.  Amy sighed, taking comfort in the familiar routine of opening up and preparing for another festival week.
