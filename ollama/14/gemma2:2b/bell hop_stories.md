The air hung thick with stale cigarette smoke and the scent of despair in the lobby of The Grand Majestic Hotel. A flickering neon sign above the front entrance buzzed insistently, casting a sickly green glow across the grimy carpet.

His name, though it echoed with a charm born from a well-meaning aunt's love for all things flowery and nostalgic, felt heavy on his tongue, as did the worn brown suit he wore to navigate this urban jungle. 

Archie's journey was far from glamorous.  A year into his bell hop life, Archie had yet to see any real reward beyond a weekly paycheck barely enough to afford a decent meal. The clientele – a kaleidoscope of eccentric personalities, each with their own stories of lost loves and broken dreams – never seemed to offer much in the way of genuine human connection.  He was a silent observer in this world, his only solace the occasional fleeting smile from a child pointing at the massive stained glass windows depicting fairytale creatures.

A single red rose clutched in her gloved hand, it was almost as if she herself held the very essence of this city's hidden secrets within its petals.
