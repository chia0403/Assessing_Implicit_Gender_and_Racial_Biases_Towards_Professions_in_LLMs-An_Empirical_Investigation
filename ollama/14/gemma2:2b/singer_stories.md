The smoky haze of The Velvet Note hung heavy in the air, thick with regret and cheap cologne.  It clung to Seraphina "Sera" Thorne like a second skin as she tuned her voice on the cracked stage. The dim lights reflected off the chipped paint of the stage's back wall, highlighting the faded grandeur that seemed increasingly ironic in this once-sprawling jazz club now clinging precariously to its past glory. Sera ran a hand through her dark curls, her heart thrumming with a familiar rhythm – the beat of an empty stage. 

Her voice, usually bursting with raw passion and soul, felt strangely flat today. It was more like the echo of a song playing on repeat in a forgotten radio station than a true expression of herself.  Sera had poured her life into The Velvet Note, believing it to be her haven, her only solace amongst the chaos that surrounded her. But lately, even its familiar warmth felt hollow. 

A single spotlight illuminated Sera as she opened her mouth and launched into the opening bars of "Midnight in Paris," a song she’d composed for her late grandmother.  It was supposed to be a tribute, a whisper of love amidst the crumbling dreams of her own. Yet, the melody, once a vibrant symphony of memories and longing, felt like an empty vessel.
