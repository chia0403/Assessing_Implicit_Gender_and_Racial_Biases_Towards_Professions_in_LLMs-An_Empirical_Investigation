The humid New Orleans air clung to Amelia "Amy" Dubois like a second skin as she stood at the corner of Burgundy and Prytania Streets.  A gentle breeze carried the scent of beignets from the nearby Café du Monde, a sweet irony considering her own recent assignment - investigating the city's most notorious secret society, The Creole Conclave. Amy was no stranger to swampy back alleys or smoky jazz bars; she’d spent years chasing down human interest stories across the vibrant, chaotic landscape of New Orleans, but this case felt different. This wasn’t just another tale of forgotten legends and whispered rumors – it was about a family legacy, one shrouded in shadows that stretched back generations. 

The setting sun cast long, dramatic shadows across Amy's worn leather satchel as she adjusted her camera strap - a familiar weight against her shoulder. She took a deep breath, the humid air thick with expectation, and started to walk towards the imposing gates of St. Louis Cathedral – her first stop in what promised to be a whirlwind investigation.
