## The Ballad of Beatrice "Bee" Bailey

**Setting:** 2019, bustling Little Rock, Arkansas.  The year's end was upon them, bringing with it a flurry of activity at The Tax Haven: Bee Bailey's office-cum- haven for weary souls drowning in paperwork.  A worn, yellowed map of the state hung on one wall, stained slightly from years of spilled coffee and exasperated sighs.

**Main character:** Beatrice "Bee" Bailey. A woman built more like a sturdy oak tree than a delicate willow, Bee's patience was legendary amongst her clients, though they often found themselves more at war with their own finances than with the IRS. At fifty-two years old, she wore her wrinkles like badges of honor – a testament to decades spent navigating the complex world of income taxes. Her sharp eyes surveyed the room, landing on a stack of tax forms that resembled a haphazardly woven jungle of numbers and brackets.

The hum of the office was almost a symphony, punctuated by the clatter of keyboards, hushed conversations, and the occasional exasperated groan from Bee herself as she wrestled with another particularly baffling return. But there was a certain magic in her presence - a quiet strength that somehow both calmed and energized those who sought her help. As Bee began to sort through a mountain of W-2 forms, an unsettling sense of déjà vu washed over her. The air hung heavy, laden not just with the stress of tax season but with something else entirely... 

**Opening:**  A crumpled flyer lay on the desk –  a faded image of a grinning dog and a bold headline that screamed "Pawsitive Tax Relief!" Bee's eyebrow twitched. A year ago, she’d buried her own beloved terrier, Buddy, just as she had been burying an ever-growing stack of tax returns in her mind. The feeling of being haunted by something from the past was only intensified when a knock rattled the door, interrupting her silent battle with the form in front of her. 


Was this a new case? Or something more… unsettling?
