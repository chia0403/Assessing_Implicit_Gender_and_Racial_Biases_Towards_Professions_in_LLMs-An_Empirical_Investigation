The desert wind whipped through the cracked vinyl seat of his rig like a phantom's caress, its icy fingers pulling at the worn leather jacket Eldred "Eddie" Hayes wore as he drove west across the Mojave.  Sunrise painted the horizon in shades of bleeding orange and sickly pink as Eddie steered his 18-wheeler, "The Lone Coyote," into the vast emptiness of Nevada.  He'd driven for forty years, a lifetime spent traversing Americaâ€™s asphalt arteries, his truck a familiar companion through blizzards and sunshine alike. But lately, there was an ache in Eddie's soul he couldn't seem to fill with miles or diesel fumes.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the barren landscape, painting them in streaks of blood orange and fading crimson as Eddie reached for a pack of cigarettes tucked under the dashboard.  He hadn't smoked in years, but this time, he knew he needed it, just like the desert air required water to survive its relentless thirst. 

A lone diner sat on the edge of nowhere, illuminated by the harsh glow of neon beer signs. Eddie glanced at his watch; it was past midnight. He couldn't remember the last time he saw another soul outside a roadside motel in this desolate stretch. Tonight, he just wanted to swallow down some coffee and find an escape from the endless road.
