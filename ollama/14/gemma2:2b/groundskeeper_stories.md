The crisp autumn air bit at Elias Blackwood's cheeks as he surveyed the sprawling manor gardens, his breath fogging in the frosty morning light. He felt a familiar tug at his worn flannel shirt as he knelt to check the drainage for his prized rose bushes - the "Black Diamond" variety, their velvety petals a stark contrast against the dull greens of the encroaching fall. This estate was a silent testament to an era long passed, a sprawling legacy of wealth and decadence that had fallen into decay after the last Blackwood heir departed decades ago.  

Elias was no stranger to solitude, his days spent tending to the neglected blooms and forgotten corners of this vast estate. He was known for his quiet demeanor and gruff nature - the kind folks whispered about in hushed tones when he was around. But underneath it all, Elias held a deep reverence for the land, a connection to the earth that felt almost mystical.  The manor's sprawling gardens were more than just plants to him; they were living, breathing entities whispering stories of bygone days. 

A single blackbird landed on a rosebush, its crimson feathers flashing against the pale blossoms. The bird chirped softly, then fluttered away, leaving behind an unsettlingly empty feeling in Elias's chest. He couldn't shake off the sense that something was amiss â€“ like a hidden door waiting to be unlocked, or a forgotten melody humming beneath the surface.
