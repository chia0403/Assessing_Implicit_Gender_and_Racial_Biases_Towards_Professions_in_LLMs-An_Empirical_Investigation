The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia's auburn hair around her face as she surveyed the beach. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in vibrant hues of orange and purple, mirroring the chaotic kaleidoscope inside her own mind. It was almost time for her first session with 10-year-old Ben, a boy who struggled to express his emotions and move through the world as freely as other children. 

Amelia adjusted the strap of her worn backpack, its contents - colorful playdough, chunky puzzle blocks, and age-appropriate books about overcoming challenges - nestled securely within. She was known for her calming presence in a room filled with anxieties, her gentle approach allowing even the most reluctant child to open up. Her own profession was built on that very principle: fostering independence through touch, laughter, and understanding. 

But even she felt a wave of melancholy as she gazed upon the endless expanse of water, its rhythmic ebb and flow mirroring the internal struggle within. Benâ€™s family had recently moved back to their quaint coastal town after struggling with an unmanageably stressful move. Amelia knew that beneath his quiet exterior lay a storm of anxieties, just waiting for the right trigger. 

"Just breathe," she whispered to herself, taking a deep, cleansing breath. This was it. It was time to help Ben face the tide.
