Rain lashed against the windows of "The Rusty Anchor,"  a dingy, cramped pub nestled at the edge of the docks. Its wooden frame was weathered, smelling faintly of stale beer and salt air. Inside, a smoky haze hung in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of plates against metalware.  Esmeralda "Esme" Davies, a girl with fiery auburn hair that she always kept tied back in a messy bun, navigated the throngs of weary sailors and port workers like an agile shadow.

Esme, who'd grown up on the rough edges of the harbor town, knew every nook and cranny of "The Anchor." She understood their stories; the silent longing in a weathered fishermanâ€™s eyes, the boisterous laughter over spilled ale, the melancholy hum of lost love whispered by weary sea dogs. Tonight, however, something felt different. The usual comforting rhythm of the pub was replaced with an eerie stillness, punctuated only by the relentless downpour and the distant creaking of the dock outside.
