The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling streets of Seattle's Pike Place market. The aroma of fresh fish mingled with coffee and roasting beans, creating an intoxicating symphony for Dr. Aila Reyes, owner and sole practitioner of "Reyes Chiropractic." Her office, tucked away in a corner of the historic building, looked less like a chiropractor's practice and more like a cozy haven from the hustle and bustle. The walls were painted in calming blues and greens, sunlight streaming through the arched windows onto her custom-made ergonomic massage chairs. 

Aila, with her warm brown eyes and gentle smile, was known for much more than just her skill at adjusting spines. She possessed an intuitive understanding of human anatomy that felt almost mystical to some. Her patients weren't simply numbers on a waiting list; they were individuals who came seeking not only relief from their aches and pains but also the hope for a healthier, happier life. Today, however, Aila's usual serenity was disrupted. A frantic woman in a disheveled coat and tearful eyes burst through her door, clutching an envelope.
