The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous symphony above Amelia "Amy" Thorne's head, casting a sterile, sickly yellow glow over the mundane landscape of her workplace. A mountain of crumpled receipts lay beside her register like a forgotten war zone, each one whispering tales of fleeting moments and hurried lives. The air hung thick with the sweet, cloying scent of overripe fruit pies, a remnant from the previous day's lunch rush. 

Amy sighed, pushing her unruly auburn hair out of her face as she scanned the latest batch of items cluttering the checkout counter. It was 2:00 pm on a Tuesday, and the slow crawl towards Friday felt like a marathon she couldn't possibly win. She yearned for something more than the endless cycle of bagging groceries and dispensing change. Somethingâ€¦ magical, perhaps?

Suddenly, the store door chimed as a gust of cool autumn air invaded the otherwise stifling interior, carrying with it the scent of rain-soaked earth and woodsmoke. A man stepped in, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. His gait was deliberate, purposeful, almost regal in its stillness.  He glanced around, eyes flitting over the familiar landscape before settling on Amy's tiny corner.
