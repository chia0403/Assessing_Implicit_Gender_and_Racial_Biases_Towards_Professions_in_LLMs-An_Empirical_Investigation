The air hung thick and heavy with the smell of fresh-cut cedarwood.  Dust motes danced in the weak afternoon sun that filtered through the tall windows of Arcturus Drafting & Design, illuminating dust specks swirling around Elias Thorne's worn workbench. He idly traced a finger across the rough surface of a blueprint, his brow furrowed in concentration. It was the fourth iteration of the "Starlight Spire," a skyscraper designed to be as iconic and awe-inspiring as it was environmentally efficient.  

Elias had been drawing blueprints since he was a kid, sketching elaborate castles and futuristic spaceships in worn textbooks he found discarded at the library. He found solace in the rhythm of his craft - the feel of graphite on paper, the satisfying click of his mechanical pencil against the blueprint, the quiet satisfaction of seeing his creations take form on paper before them. 

The blueprints were just sketches now; the real building was far from a completed vision.  He sighed, rubbing his tired eyes behind thick-rimmed glasses. It wasn't just the endless revisions and setbacks - it was the weight of expectation that seemed to press down on him. He knew this project could make or break him, not to mention the company.
