The humid air clung to Theodore "Theo" Finch like a second skin as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors of Zenith Institute. Dust motes danced in the weak beams of fluorescent light that pierced the cavernous space, illuminating cracked concrete and faded murals depicting long-forgotten scientific breakthroughs.  He was just another cog in the machinery of a place where dreams became reality, a place where even the janitor's job was seen as an essential step in that grander scheme. 

Theo's work began every day at dawn, navigating past sleeping researchers and echoing whispers of theories. His usual route led him through labs abandoned to the ghosts of failed experiments, past the hushed whispers of scientists hunched over monitors, and into the vast communal space where students gathered for late-night study sessions or early morning yoga.  His days were marked by a strange rhythm, a symphony of creaking floors, whirring centrifuges, and the soft murmur of the Institute's heartbeat. 

Today, though, something felt different. A tremor shook the very floor beneath his feet as he neared the main lab, sending shivers down Theo's spine.  He stopped, holding back a groan at the sight of what looked like aâ€¦crack? It snaked its way across the pristine white surface of the floorboards, a jagged scar on the otherwise sterile canvas. The crack pulsed, growing with each passing second, as if the very fabric of the lab was groaning under some unseen pressure.
