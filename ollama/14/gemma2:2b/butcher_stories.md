The air in the shop hung thick with the scent of salt, blood, and aging leather. It was a familiar aroma to Bartholomew "Barth" Bellweather, the owner and operator of Bellweather's Meat Market for the past forty years. The worn wooden counter gleamed under the harsh fluorescent light above, reflecting the grime that clung to it like the memories of hundreds of slaughtered animals. The shop, nestled on the edge of a bustling market square in a forgotten corner of New England, was as much a part of the town as its cobbled streets and creaking clocks. 

Barth's hands, calloused and rough-hewn, moved with the grace of a practiced dancer as he sliced through a thick hunk of pork loin. The sound of his shears cutting through the flesh was as familiar as the rhythmic thumping of the old shop bell. Every morning, the aroma of freshly ground spices and sizzling meats wafted down the narrow alleyway, drawing in customers like moths to a flame. Today, however, an unsettling quiet hung in the air, a silence deeper than usual. The town seemed unusually still â€“ even the chickens clucking in their coop across the street were unusually subdued. 


This was the day of the annual Harvest Festival, a celebration that usually brought life and laughter to this sleepy town. But today, something felt off.  A heavy tension pulsed beneath the surface of the bustling market. The air crackled with unspoken worry, the silence broken only by the rhythmic ticking of the clock above Barth's meat shop door.
