## The Indigo Shadow

**Setting:** A crumbling, once-grand artist's studio nestled deep within the decaying heart of Paris. 

The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the fading light that pierced through cracks in the boarded windows.  The scent of aged turpentine and linseed oil clung to the worn canvas walls, a constant reminder of the vibrant life that once throbbed here.  Now, only silence echoed within, punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of an old grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging like a metronome lost in time.

**Character:** **Althea Beaumont**, her fingers trembling slightly as she held a broken palette knife against the light. 

Her once vibrant auburn hair had faded to a dull, almost grey halo around her face, etched with worry and years of chasing shadows.  Years had stolen the youthful gleam from Althea's eyes, leaving them pools of weary contemplation. The canvas stretched before her lay barren, a stark reminder of the emptiness that echoed within. 

"It will be alright," she muttered under her breath, more to herself than anyone else. "It always is."


**Opening:**  Althea stared at the blank canvas with a sense of dread she couldn't quite explain. It was as if a gaping hole had been torn in her soul, mirroring the emptiness that now consumed her studio. She longed to pour life back into it, but the paint felt heavy, thick, even resistant. The weight of her last masterpiece, "The Indigo Shadow," had become a crushing burden on her spirit.  

How could she create beauty when even the light felt as dim as her own fading hope?
