## The Scent of Lemon and Dust

The scent clung to Amelia like a second skin - a heady mix of lemon disinfectant and the worn floral wallpaper that lined every hallway in the sprawling Blackwood Manor. For years, Amelia had been the silent guardian of its grandeur, meticulously keeping the dust at bay, the shadows from day-to-day life at bay. She navigated the winding halls with practiced ease, her eyes flitting across each polished surface and ornate detail, a symphony of whispers and echoes in the cavernous spaces. The year was 1937, and the echoes of the past still lingered in this creaky behemoth, the kind that made Amelia's heart ache for something she couldn't quite grasp.

Amelia, with her simple grey dress and neatly braided hair, blended into the backdrop of the manor like a whisper. Even the Blackwood family, notorious for their eccentricities and dramatic flourishes, seemed to have resigned themselves to her presence as they flitted through the grand halls, leaving trails of gossip and intrigue in their wake.  

But Amelia wasn't here simply out of duty. The house held secrets she had yet to uncover, whispers hidden within the dust-caked furniture and forgotten stories tucked away in the antique gramophones. And tonight, as the last sliver of moon dipped beneath the horizon, Amelia felt a familiar pull towards the grand ballroom, its mahogany floor gleaming under the faint glow of flickering gaslights. The scent of lemon lingered heavier there, almost intoxicating, promising something more than just dust and shadows.
