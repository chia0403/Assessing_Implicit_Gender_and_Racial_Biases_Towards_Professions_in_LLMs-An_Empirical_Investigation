## The Dust Rose

**Setting:** A parched stretch of Wyoming, where the wind whipped through towering mesas like claws tearing at a wounded sky. Sunlight bled across the horizon, painting the earth in hues of ochre and crimson, while an oppressive silence blanketed everything except the rustle of dry grass under weary feet. 

**Character:** The name on everyone's lips was "Dalton," but few knew his soul well enough to pronounce it properly. To them, he was just another stoic cowboy, weathered and worn like the land itself. He stood tall at six foot two, his jaw as hard and unforgiving as the granite outcroppings that dotted the landscape. Dalton's hands, calloused from years of toil, gripped a worn leather canteen, its metal cool against the burning heat of the day. 

**Opening:** The wind clawed at Dalton's worn Stetson, whistling like a banshee through his skull and sending shivers down his spine.  He stared at the dust-bowl horizon where the sun was bleeding out to a fiery red before sinking beneath a curtain of purple and grey clouds. In this harsh landscape, where even the sky seemed to hold its breath in anticipation of something worse, he knew there was no escape. Not until this storm came, at least. 

Dalton had spent his entire life on this land, tending to his herd as if they were children. But the land itself seemed to be dying, and with it, Dalton's spirit. The rain that once fell like a blessing now felt like a mockery of hope. His cattle, already weakened by the drought, stood listlessly in the unforgiving heat, their eyes reflecting the emptiness he carried within his soul. Tonight, the storm would decide who lived, and who died.
