Amelia was, at best, efficient; at worst, she found solace in the mundane routine of the job, greeting customers as they arrived, directing them to their rooms, ensuring their stay feltâ€¦ satisfactory. But even with years under her belt, she never quite mastered the art of "making people feel special."
