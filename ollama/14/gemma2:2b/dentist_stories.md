The rain drummed a relentless rhythm against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Thorne's office, mimicking the anxious beat in her own chest. Her patients were notoriously skittish - especially under these perpetually grey skies, which seemed to seep into the very fabric of their anxieties.  A familiar chill ran down her spine as she pulled out another patient file, its yellowing pages whispering tales of chipped teeth and lost smiles, before quickly being whisked away by a surge of pre-appointment jitters. 

Amelia's heart pounded against her ribs like a trapped bird. She adjusted the thick silver spectacles perched on her nose and took a deep breath, attempting to calm the storm brewing within. This was the routine - a daily ritual that felt less like an art and more like a battle against a relentless tide of worry.  After all, it wasn't just the anxieties of her patients she had to face; she also battled them every day in her own life. The weight of expectations, both personal and professional, pressed down on Amelia, heavy and suffocating, especially under this perpetual grey sky.
