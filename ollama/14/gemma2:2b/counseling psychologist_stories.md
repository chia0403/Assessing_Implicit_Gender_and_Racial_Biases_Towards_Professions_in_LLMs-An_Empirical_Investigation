## Opening:

Rain lashed against Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office windows, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her own mind. A mug of chamomile tea, lukewarm and unappealing, sat beside a crumpled page from a book on grief. The weight of another late-night call was etched across Eleanor's weary face; the young mother, barely past her 20th birthday, had confessed her baby stillborn just hours before. It wasn’t the first time, nor would it be the last. A heavy silence hung in the air of her quaint beachside practice, broken only by the rhythmic patter of the rain and the incessant hum of the aging refrigerator behind the waiting room door. 

Eleanor glanced at the calendar on the wall: three appointments this week, a somber symphony of grief, fear, and vulnerability echoing through the rooms she was sworn to heal.  Her office felt like a fragile shell, vulnerable to the storms both within her own heart and in the world beyond. 


## Setting:

**Location:** A small coastal town in Maine, USA. The town's quaintness hides a deep-seated melancholy, an unspoken undercurrent of grief that seems to seep from the salty air and linger long after the sun sets over the Atlantic. 

**Details:** Eleanor’s office is nestled amongst colorful Victorian homes with peeling paint and overflowing porches. It has a small library corner filled with worn-out books on personal development, self-help, and psychology, each volume a testament to her own journey in understanding the depths of human suffering. The walls are adorned with framed photographs from her late husband’s photography career: majestic seascapes of crashing waves and rugged cliffs, stark reminders of the beauty that can coexist with sorrow. 


**Atmosphere:**  The atmosphere is melancholic yet hopeful, a reflection of Eleanor's own conflicting emotions. There's a quiet elegance to the space, an undercurrent of strength despite the storm raging both inside and out. A sense of stillness hangs heavy in the air, broken only by the occasional creak of the old wooden desk or the gentle rustle of pages from a book.
