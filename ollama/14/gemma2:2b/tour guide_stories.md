The air hung thick with the scent of salt and diesel as Evelyn Blackwood, proprietor of "Blackwood's Bygone Voyages" tours and all-around historical enthusiast, waited patiently by the rickety dock. The morning sun glinted off the cobblestones, casting long shadows that stretched like grasping fingers across the bustling harbor. She clutched her worn leather-bound notebook, its pages filled with meticulously hand-drawn maps of the city's hidden alleys and forgotten stories. 

Today was a special day: Evelyn's inaugural tour of the "Ghostly Galleon," a legendary merchant ship said to have vanished without a trace in the stormy waters centuries ago.  Evelyn loved these tales, whispered by salty sea dogs and passed down through generations like precious treasures. Now, with the city's newest lighthouse beckoning her and eager tourists lining up on the dock, she was ready to share them with the world. 

The tour was a gamble: a unique blend of historical research and storytelling. Tourists often flocked to her company for its authentic feel - Evelyn had spent years studying local legends and poring over ancient maps. This, she knew, could be the breakthrough that set her business apart.
