The aroma of stale coffee and burnt toast hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock that stood sentinel in the corner of Amelia "Amy" Thorne's office.  It was 3:17 AM, the time she could usually find solace in amidst the chaos of the tax season.  But tonight was different. Tonight, the weight of the unfiled invoices, looming like a storm cloud over her meticulously ordered desk, threatened to engulf her entirely. The bills piled up, each one a silent testament to the mounting pressure of running "Thorne's Tiny Treasures," a quaint antique store nestled in the heart of quaint Maplewood.  Amy, with her sharp eye for detail and a penchant for historical accuracy, could turn the most ordinary day into a magical journey through forgotten times. But right now, she was losing ground to the ever-growing mountain of financial chaos. 


**Setting:** A small antique shop in the quiet town of Maplewood, Vermont, where time seems to move at a slower pace and secrets linger in the dusty corners.  Amy's office is tucked away in the back, its cluttered desk a testament to her meticulous nature.
