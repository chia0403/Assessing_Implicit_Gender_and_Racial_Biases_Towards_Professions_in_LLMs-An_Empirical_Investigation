Rain hammered against the windowpane of Dr. Eleanor Ainsworth's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her own mind. It was an unseasonably harsh April in Chicago, even for this perpetually grey city, and the thunderous rhythm seemed to pulsate to the beat of her unease. 

Eleanor adjusted her glasses, squinting at the file lying open on her desk. The case files had been a predictable blur – witness testimonies, crime scene photos, and countless hours spent poring over technical jargon. Yet, this one felt different.  The victim’s name, John “Jack” O'Malley, barely registered in the cacophony of cases she usually dealt with. He was just another statistical anomaly, another face on a crowded wall of victims that haunted her every waking moment. 

But Jack’s case was different. The brutality of his death, the meticulous nature of the crime scene – it left a trail of unanswered questions and an inexplicable sense of unease that Eleanor couldn't shake off. As she leaned back in her chair, exhaustion clawing at her eyes, the only comfort came from the faint aroma of freshly brewed chamomile tea swirling through the air - a constant presence in her life, calming and grounding.  The storm outside mirrored the tempest in her soul; she just needed to understand what was brewing before it reached its boiling point.
