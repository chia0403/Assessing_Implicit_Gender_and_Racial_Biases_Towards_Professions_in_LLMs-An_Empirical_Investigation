## Story Opening

**Setting:** A decaying Victorian mansion perched on the windswept cliffs of Cornwall. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, mirroring the tempestuous emotions swirling within Amelia "Em" Thorne's heart. 

**Characters:**

* **Amelia "Em" Thorne:**  A celebrated theatrical director, known for her bold, experimental productions, but haunted by a past tragedy that seems to linger in the echoing halls of this very mansion.

The year is 1923. Em was invited here by the estate's new owner, a shadowy figure named Lord Ashworth. He wanted her to stage a play within the dilapidated walls of his ancestral home, a project meant to re-energize the dying art of dramatic performance.  Em had long since left the world of traditional theatre behind, embracing avant-garde and surrealist themes in her work. This seemed like an odd fit until she saw the crumbling grandeur of Ashworth's mansion – a stark reminder of a legacy lost to time and neglect. 

**Opening Lines:**  

*The wind howled like a banshee, its mournful cry echoing through the shattered windows of the grand manor. Inside, Amelia Thorne paced, her face a mask of steely determination that couldn’t quite hide the turmoil in her eyes.* 

*“A tragedy,” she muttered to herself, tracing a shaky finger across the worn spine of the play script clutched in her hand. “But one I can rewrite.”*
