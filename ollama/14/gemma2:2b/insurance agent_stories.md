## Opening

The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Amelia Bell's throat like a damp shroud as she stepped out of her car at the sprawling estate on Briarwood Road.  It was the kind of place that made even the most jaded city dweller raise an eyebrow – a manicured oasis built around a century-old oak, its branches gnarled with age and heavy with secrets. 

Amelia, however, was not fazed. A seasoned agent for Bell & Associates, she'd seen it all:  the opulent mansions of the wealthy elite juxtaposed against the humble beginnings of blue-collar families who had clawed their way up from nothing to build something beautiful. She was a quiet observer in this whirlwind of wealth and privilege, her purpose as clear as a compass needle: assess risk, mitigate loss, and make sure every life within the estate's gilded cage was insured against whatever fate might throw at them. 

Today’s assignment, however, felt different. The air crackled with an undercurrent of tension, not just from the oppressive heat but something deeper, something akin to a storm brewing on the horizon.  The mansion itself seemed to shrink under her gaze, its facade now radiating an ominous aura that Amelia knew was more than the usual reflection of its inhabitants' status.
