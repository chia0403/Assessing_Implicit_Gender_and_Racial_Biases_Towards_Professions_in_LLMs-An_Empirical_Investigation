The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling San Francisco street, highlighting the chipped paint on the vintage storefront where Dr. Eliana Thorne ran her practice. A wave of salty air whipped in from the bay, carrying the scent of brine and something else – a faint metallic tang that prickled at Eliana’s nostrils as she stepped out of her building, ready to face the day's appointments.  Her worn leather briefcase felt heavy against her hip. It contained more than just medical charts – this was her connection to her patients, their stories etched into the yellowed pages and the small, handwritten notes tucked inside. 

Eliana’s practice, nestled in the heart of Chinatown, was no ordinary haven for the ailing. Each patient carried a story woven with threads of hardship and resilience, whispered on windswept corners and simmering within familiar faces. She treated not just ailments but also their deep-seated anxieties and unspoken truths - and Eliana knew that sometimes, healing meant holding space for the pain instead of merely alleviating it.  

Today, she had a particularly challenging case: Mrs. Lin, her patient with the recurring coughs, a woman who spoke of dreams and fears in hushed tones that whispered through the crowded clinic’s waiting room.
