##  The Razor's Edge

**Setting:** A dusty, late-afternoon haze settled over the cobbled streets of Almendro, a small town clinging to the foot of the jagged Drakensberg Mountains. The scent of honeysuckle and woodsmoke mingled with the tang of sweat and old leather that permeated the air around Elron "Razor" Blackwood's barbershop.  

**Character:** Elron "Razor" Blackwood was known for more than just his masterful skill with a razor. At seventy, he was an institution in Almendro, a man whose weathered face told tales of countless shaves and the years spent listening to townsfolk whisper their woes over steaming mugs of coffee. His shop, 'Blackwood's Blades', stood as a testament to the passing generations; its wood-paneled walls held a comforting silence that only the rhythmic scrape of the barber’s shears could disrupt.  


**Opening:** A gust of wind slammed against the barbershop door, whipping the worn curtains into a frenzy. Elron "Razor" Blackwood sighed, his weathered face creasing further as he glanced at the newspaper lying abandoned on the counter. The headline screamed in bold black print: *Unnatural Disappearance - Almendro's Missing Girl*. His eyes, deep-set and grey with age, searched for the story’s details, a flicker of concern dancing in their depths. He knew these stories well.  The missing children of Almendro were a plague on this quiet town, each disappearance leaving an echoing void in its heart. 

Elron took his place behind the counter, the smell of sandalwood and shaving cream calming him momentarily.  He picked up the newspaper again, tracing the faded ink with a calloused thumb.  A name stood out, a young girl he'd seen at the town square market just last week: Amelia Thorne. A shiver ran down his spine; she reminded him of someone… someone long forgotten and lost in the tapestry of time.
