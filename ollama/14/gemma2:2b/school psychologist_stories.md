The late afternoon sun slanted through the windows of Willow Creek Middle School, painting long, lazy shadows across Dr. Amelia Hayes' office. A cacophony of laughter and hushed whispers from within the building filled her ears, but in Amelia's mind, she was adrift in a sea of swirling thoughts: anxieties about the upcoming school board meeting, the latest caseload of emotionally-troubled students, and an uncharacteristic sense of dread about a seemingly mundane school function - a bake sale. 

Amelia, ever resourceful, had been tasked with orchestrating a "Community Connection" corner at the bake sale to encourage parents to connect with one another over homemade treats. It was intended as a simple gesture to foster community, but the idea felt like a weight in her chest, heavier than the giant bag of sugar she'd just pulled out for decoration. 


She adjusted the framed picture on her desk - a smiling Amelia from her graduation day, holding her diploma - a relic from her past that seemed strangely distant and insignificant now.
