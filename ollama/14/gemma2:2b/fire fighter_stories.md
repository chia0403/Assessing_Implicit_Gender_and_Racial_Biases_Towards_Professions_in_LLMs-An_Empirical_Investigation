The howling wind tore through the canyon, whipping rain against Elias "Hawkeye" Cartwright's face as he gripped the worn leather of his helmet.  A cold drizzle had settled onto the desolate landscape, blurring the already faded red and orange hues of the fading sunset. Above, the sky was a bruised purple, mirroring the storm brewing in Hawkeye's gut. It had been five years since the fire at Pine Creek - five years of nightmares that never seemed to fade, five years of guilt eating away at his soul. He adjusted his pack straps, each weight on it a painful reminder of what he could and couldn't control.  Tonight was the anniversary. 

**Setting:** A remote canyon town nestled within the heart of the rugged mountains of Colorado. The remnants of Pine Creek – a quaint logging community wiped away by an inferno that raged like a beast for days – still stood as silent monuments to their loss, standing stark against the backdrop of nature's untamed power. 

**Main character:** Elias "Hawkeye" Cartwright - A seasoned firefighter with a scarred past and eyes forever trained to find the fire before it found them. He carries the weight of his duty and the burden of the memories he tries so hard to bury beneath years of adrenaline and smoke-filled air.
