## The Chipped Whistle

**Setting:** The sun bled over the horizon, painting the coastal town of Seahaven in shades of orange and pink. The air held a tang of salt and sea spray, mingled with the sweet scent of blossoming jasmine drifting from Mrs. Peabody's herb garden across the street.  The beach was still dark, shadows clinging to the weathered dunes like ghosts. 

**Character:** Amelia Cartwright, PT. A woman whose face held the subtle lines of experience and the soft glow of a quiet strength, Amelia surveyed her patient's newly-cleaned apartment, the space buzzing with a chaotic energy she found both stimulating and exhausting.  Her name was etched into the battered metal frame of the antique rocking chair beside the fireplace - the only piece that hadn’t been replaced by modern furniture in the last 10 years. The house had belonged to Mrs. Peabody's late husband, a man whose life had mirrored Amelia’s own: long days on his feet, and nights with dreams that ran as wild as the waves.

**Opening Line:** A chipped whistle - she didn't notice it at first; just another little piece of the puzzle - caught her ear as Mrs. Peabody began to speak about a memory.
