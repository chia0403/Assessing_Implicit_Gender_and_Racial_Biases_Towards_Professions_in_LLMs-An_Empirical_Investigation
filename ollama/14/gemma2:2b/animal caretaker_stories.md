The morning mist clung to Willowbrook Farm like damp fur on a hound dog.  It swirled around Amelia "May" Hawthorne's ankles as she surveyed the sprawling fields, her worn leather boots crunching softly on the dew-soaked grass.  May was a veteran of farm life, twenty years in and counting, and even after all this time, she still took pleasure in the simple rhythm of sunrise and sunset. 

The aroma of freshly mown hay, sweet clover blossoms, and a hint of woodsmoke from the old barn mingled in the air. May’s favorite part of each day was tending to the alpacas.  Their soft brown fleece brushed against her hands as she moved through their pen, their gentle bleats filling the quiet space with warmth.  But today, something felt off. The usual calm was replaced by a sense of unease that tightened in May’s chest like a lead weight.
