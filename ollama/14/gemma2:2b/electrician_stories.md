The neon glow of "Jimmy's Electrical" was barely noticeable through the heavy rain hammering against the shop awning. The wind whipped at Amelia's worn jacket as she waited for her uncle Jimmy to unlock the door, his familiar calloused hand wrestling with the aging lock.  Her thick boots, soaked from a half-mile trek across the deserted parking lot, squelched on the wet pavement. 

Amelia was no stranger to rain, not even to the sting of cold it brought. But this was different. It felt heavier than usual, an oppressive blanket smothering the city’s sounds. The air hung heavy with a foreboding that made her stomach clench.  It had been just weeks since her father’s passing and she was still grappling with grief, but tonight, a strange sense of urgency pulled at her like an unseen tide.
