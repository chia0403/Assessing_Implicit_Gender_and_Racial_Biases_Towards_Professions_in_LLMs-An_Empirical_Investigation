Rain lashed against the rusty awning of "Frank's Garage," the scent of burnt oil clinging to the air like an unwelcome guest. Inside, a haze hung over the space - the kind you get when fluorescent lights are battling with the soot-stained grease splatter on old metal tools. 

The rain seemed to carry with it a mournful symphony of wind whistling through broken glass and the rhythmic thudding of puddles against the corrugated roof of the garage.  Frank, whose real name was actually Frederick, but everyone called him Frank, squinted at the oil-slicked engine block in front of him. His brow furrowed as he inspected the spark plugs. 

He was a man who lived by routine, and even the storm couldn't break his carefully curated order. Every click and clack of the wrench felt like a rhythm to him, each drop of oil meticulously cleaned from the bay floor a silent testament to years spent honing his craft. He’d been fixing cars since he was a kid, learning on scraps from his grandfather's old garage in rural Wisconsin. Now, at 62, Frank ran "Frank's Garage," a beacon of hope for weathered vehicles and weary souls alike.

But the storm felt different today. There was a tension in the air that seemed to vibrate through every tool in the shop, mirroring the storm raging outside. And beneath the rain-streaked window, there was a flicker of something else – fear.
