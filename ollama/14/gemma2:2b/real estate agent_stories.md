The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Elmwood Estates, where homes shimmered like polished gemstones in an endless sea of greenery. This was the domain of Amelia "Amy" Thorne, the youngest and perhaps most promising realtor in the entire city. Her office window looked out onto a meticulously kept garden, its vibrant blooms adding a splash of colour to her otherwise sterile workspace. 

Amy sighed as she flipped through the latest listing brochures, their glossy pages filled with pictures of pristine kitchens and sunlit living rooms that would make even the most jaded homeowner dream. It was always tempting to get lost in the facade, but Amy knew better.  Beneath the surface, beneath the carefully curated façade of "perfect homes," lay the gritty reality: the lives lived within them. The families that huddled around worn wooden tables for Sunday dinners, the couples who whispered secrets late at night as they made their way through life's most challenging chapters. It was these stories that fueled Amy’s spirit, and she yearned to be a part of weaving those narratives into reality. 

Today, however, was particularly tough.  A recent wave of high-profile divorces had left the neighborhood feeling strangely melancholic, and even Amy's usual zest for life seemed dampened by the gloom. Her latest listing – The Manor at Meadowbrook - stood as a silent testament to the unspoken tension that permeated the community: a sprawling Victorian mansion with intricate details, its beauty marred by an unsettling emptiness.  The sale was crucial not just for Amy's career but also for the hope of mending a fractured neighborhood.
