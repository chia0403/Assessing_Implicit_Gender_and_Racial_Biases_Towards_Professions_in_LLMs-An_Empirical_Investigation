The wind whipped across the open plains of Montana, whistling through the gnarled branches of the old Ponderosa pine that marked the edge of Silas Blackwood's workshop.  Silas, hands calloused but gentle, surveyed the sprawling timber frame he was currently constructing â€“ another addition to his family home in the heart of a century-old town called Riverbend.

It was a familiar routine, one that had defined him since childhood, but today, it felt different. There was an unbidden knot in his stomach, a feeling of unease he couldn't shake. 

His father, William Blackwood, stood watching from the porch steps. His weathered face held the silent wisdom of years spent under the Montana sun, yet his gaze seemed clouded with worry.  "Something wrong, Silas?" he asked finally, his voice gravelly and low like the whisper of wind through dry leaves.
