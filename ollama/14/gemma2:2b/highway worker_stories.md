The wind whipped across the endless ribbon of asphalt, carrying with it the scent of diesel fumes and the promise of a coming storm.  Rain was already beginning to splatter on the corrugated metal roof of his trailer, turning the air thick and heavy like syrup. Daniel “Danny” Blackwood sat at his table, the plastic surface slick from condensation, and stared out the window at the rain blurring the horizon. The highway stretched before him, a gray expanse of concrete under the unforgiving sky.  The rhythmic hum of the generators was a constant companion; a low-frequency lullaby that had been his life's soundtrack for the past decade.

Danny wasn’t meant to be this way.  He yearned for something more, a taste of adventure beyond the monotonous routine of repairing potholes and patching cracks. His dreams were as weathered as the old highway itself, filled with pictures of towering mountains and cascading waterfalls, places that felt worlds away from his dusty, isolated life in the middle of nowhere. He’d been stuck here since high school graduation, trapped under the weight of a father's legacy and a promise to follow in his footsteps, paving the way for the next generation of Blackwoods. 

But tonight, something felt different.  A restlessness he hadn't felt before stirred within him, the storm echoing his own anxieties. He reached out and picked up a photo from the table – a snapshot of his younger self, grinning wide with his dad in front of a mountain range painted with fiery sunset hues. Maybe it was time for a change, Danny thought, staring at the image.  Maybe the asphalt wasn't destined to be his forever.
