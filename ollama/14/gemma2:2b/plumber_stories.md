## The Wrench & the Wailing

The rain hammered against the rusty steel lid of Mr. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' van. It wasn't just water falling; it was the weight of years, a lifetime spent wading through city sewers and leaky pipes. Inside, Bart hummed along to his favorite blues record, its worn vinyl a comforting echo in the cramped space.  The air smelled faintly of chlorine from the last job and old grease, the perfect aroma for a man who'd spent more time with grime than sunshine.

It wasn't always this way. Bart had dreamed of sailing the open sea when he was young. But his father, a gruff, pragmatic plumber himself, steered him towards a life of fixing leaky faucets and unclogging toilets. It wasn't glamorous, but it was honest work, and something about it resonated deep within Bart – like a song that never quite left your ear after the last chord. 

Tonight, though, was different. The usual symphony of dripping pipes had been replaced by an anguished wail from his old friend’s apartment building across the street. A desperate, almost pleading sound, carried on the wind and the rain.  It seemed like a plea for help. For someone who understood Bart's quiet language, the one he spoke with a leaky valve and a wrench. It beckoned him to answer the call, even as the storm outside threatened to swallow his van whole.
