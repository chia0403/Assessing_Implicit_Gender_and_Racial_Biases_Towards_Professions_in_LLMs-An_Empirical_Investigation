Rain hammered against the tin roof of the old shack, a steady rhythm that only intensified the feeling of being trapped inside.  Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow light filtering through the grimy windows as Amelia "Amy" Pierce meticulously cleaned her equipment, her fingers tracing the contours of a vintage antenna with calloused fingertips. The radio technician's tools were more than just instruments; they held a life force she knew intimately. For Amy, the airwaves weren't merely signals – they were whispers of forgotten voices, stories waiting to be told, truths yearning for expression.

The storms had come in like a sudden rage, shutting down the entire grid and plunging the tiny coastal town of Oakhaven into darkness. Her heart clenched with frustration as she struggled to coax life back into the battered radio chassis, its worn brass skin reflecting the storm's fury. 

Oakhaven had always been her haven – a haven that was starting to feel more like an island shrouded in an endless grey sky.  She just wanted to hear something beyond the relentless drumming of rain and the wind's mournful wail. Something, anything, to break this oppressive silence.
