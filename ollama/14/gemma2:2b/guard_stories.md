The iron gates groaned in protest as they swung open, letting out a plume of dust that billowed across the vast, ochre-tinged plains of Kestrel's Reach. A thin line of scorching sun sliced through the oppressive sky, casting long, skeletal shadows across the sprawling compound. Inside its walls lay the city of Veridian, nestled within a natural basin carved by ancient volcanic eruptions.  Here, in this place untouched by the unforgiving winds of the desert, resided Elara Thorne, guard captain and sworn protector of the sacred grove. 

Elara's worn leather armor creaked softly with each deliberate movement as she strode into the city's heart. The sun beat down upon her bronze-laced helm, its reflection mirroring the worry etching lines on her weathered face. She surveyed the sprawling avenues that lay before her – a mosaic of brightly colored stone buildings and flowering courtyards. Children played amidst ornate fountains, their laughter carried on the dry wind, each sound a stark contrast to the heavy weight pressing on Elara's chest.  A tension so thick it felt like smoke hung in the air. The usual vibrant pulse of Veridian had been replaced by an almost tangible dread. 

For weeks, whispers of unrest had been swirling through the city's undercurrents. Tonight, however, the silence was a scream. Elara’s gut twisted with a premonition. The silence before the storm wasn’t calm – it was pregnant with something dark and dangerous.
