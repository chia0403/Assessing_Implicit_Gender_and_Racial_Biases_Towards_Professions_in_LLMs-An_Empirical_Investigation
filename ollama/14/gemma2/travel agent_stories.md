The air in Penelope Evangeline Thistlewick’s tiny office hung heavy with the scent of dusty brochures and unfulfilled dreams. A lone, flickering fluorescent bulb cast long shadows across stacks of guidebooks piled precariously high on her rickety desk. Outside, the relentless drizzle hammered against the frosted glass windowpanes, mimicking the incessant drumbeat of Penelope's anxiety.  It was 2pm on a Tuesday, prime travel booking time, and not a single customer had graced her doorstep all day. Penelope sighed, idly tracing patterns in the condensation with a chubby finger. This wasn't how she'd envisioned things when she'd poured her heart and soul into opening "Penelope’s Passport to Paradise" just three months ago.  


The little travel agency was tucked away on a quiet side street in Portchester, a town whose main attractions seemed to be its annual pie competition and the rather pungent fish market. Penelope yearned for bustling airports, exotic locales, and the thrill of helping her clients create unforgettable adventures. Instead, she was drowning in unpaid bills and a crippling sense of isolation.  Just as despair threatened to consume her entirely, the bell above her door tinkled, signaling the arrival of her first customer since morning.
