The rain hammered against Detective Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's trench coat like a thousand tiny fists, each one demanding to be heard above the city's symphony of sirens and car horns.  

She stood hunched on the slick cobblestones outside the Grand Majestic Theatre, its once-gilded facade now stained with grime and despair. A thin blue ribbon, flapping listlessly in the wind, marked the entrance – a grim reminder that something terrible had happened within those walls. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth, stale popcorn, and a metallic tang that made Amy's stomach clench. This wasn't just another routine murder investigation; this felt different. There was an undercurrent of ancient fear clinging to the theatre like cobwebs, whispering secrets Amy couldn't quite decipher.


Amy pulled her collar tighter against the chill, her gaze fixed on the boarded-up stage door. It was here, in the heart of the Grand Majestic, that a young actress, Lily Sterling, had met her end during the final performance of their latest production – "The Shadow Play." A play about jealousy, betrayal, and a vengeful spirit haunting the theatre's history.
