The scent of stale crayons and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Dr. Amelia "Amy" Finch as she stepped into the brightly-coloured hallway of Maplewood Elementary. It was her favourite time of day: mid-morning, just before recess, when the cacophony of childhood had reached its peak but hadn't quite shattered into utter chaos. She adjusted her floral-print blouse and straightened her glasses, feeling a surge of calm amidst the buzzing energy. Amy loved this school, with its chipped paint, mismatched furniture, and endearingly boisterous students. It was a microcosm of life itself: messy, vibrant, and ultimately, filled with hope.  

Today, however, that hope felt thin. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than usual even for Maplewood's energetic atmosphere. Whispers followed her down the hallway, hushed yet distinct, like the rustling of leaves in a restless wind. It was about Liam Carter, a quiet and usually unassuming boy in Mrs. Peterson’s third-grade class. 


Amy knew something was terribly wrong. She had a feeling that, behind the whispers, lay a storm brewing – one she needed to navigate before it consumed Liam entirely.
