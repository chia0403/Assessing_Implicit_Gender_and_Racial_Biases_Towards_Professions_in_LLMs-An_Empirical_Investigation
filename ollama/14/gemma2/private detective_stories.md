The rain hammered against Detective Alistair Finch's office window, each drop exploding in a tiny burst of neon-tinged spray against the grime-coated glass. The street below, perpetually shrouded in a haze of diesel fumes and damp asphalt, throbbed with the restless energy of a city refusing to sleep.

Alistair sat slumped in his worn leather armchair, the dim glow of the desk lamp highlighting the fatigue etched into the sharp lines of his face. He was nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee, the bitter taste doing little to chase away the lingering chill that had seeped into his bones. The case files lay scattered across his desk â€“ each one a puzzle begging to be solved, each one another layer in the labyrinthine heart of the city's underbelly.

Just then, the door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and the scent of wet wool. A woman stood framed in the doorway, her figure obscured by the swirling rain. Her silhouette was slender, the edges blurred by the flickering streetlights outside. Alistair raised an eyebrow, his gaze settling on the single red rose clutched tightly in her gloved hand. 


"Detective Finch?" she asked, her voice a low murmur that seemed to rise from the storm itself. "I have a case for you."
