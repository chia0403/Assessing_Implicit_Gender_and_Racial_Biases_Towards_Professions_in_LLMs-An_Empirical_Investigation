The sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Route 66, shimmering like a mirage over the endless ribbon of road stretching before him. A lone tumbleweed rolled across the parched landscape, kicked up by a sudden gust of wind that rattled against the rusted sides of Bartholomew "Bart" Jackson's eighteen-wheeler.  His CB crackled with static, the only company he had besides the dusty ghosts of travelers past who haunted these stretches of highway. Bart gripped the steering wheel, his knuckles white as bone, and squinted through the heat haze towards the next town – Tucumcari, New Mexico – its neon signs flickering promises of greasy spoons and cheap motel rooms. He was running on fumes and ambition, hauling a load of frozen chickens from Amarillo to Phoenix, with only the hum of the engine and the ghost of a country song crackling from his battered cassette player for company.  Bart had always been a man who felt most alive behind the wheel, navigating the open road with the same steady hand he used to hold a six-shooter back in his wilder days. This run, however, felt different. There was a heaviness in the air, a sense of unease that clung to him like desert dust.  


He wasn't sure what it was, but Bart had a feeling this journey would be unlike any other he'd taken before.
