Her current case, the defense of a renowned pastry chef accused of stealing a rival's secret croissant recipe, seemed as unyielding and doughy as the very subject matter.

She dreamt of dusty archives, forgotten manuscripts, and unraveling historical mysteries – a far cry from defending bickering bakers and disgruntled CEOs. But for now, the bills needed paying, and the Legal Eagles provided a steady income, even if it was slowly draining her soul.
