The scent of antiseptic and damp cotton hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont.  She surveyed the room, its sterile white walls punctuated by vibrant splashes of color from the patient's art project â€“ a lopsided sunflower painstakingly crafted from tissue paper and glitter glue. 

Ellie was an occupational therapist at Sunnyside Rehab Center, a haven for those recovering from strokes, accidents, or surgeries. Each day brought new challenges, but also the quiet satisfaction of witnessing progress. This morning, however, felt different. A tension coiled in Ellie's gut, a premonition she couldn't shake. The sunflower, normally indicative of hope and resilience, seemed to droop under the fluorescent lights. 


The setting: Sunnyside Rehab Center, a sprawling complex nestled amidst rolling hills on the outskirts of a bustling city. The air is thick with the hum of rehabilitation equipment, the murmur of patient conversation, and the occasional burst of laughter from group therapy sessions.
