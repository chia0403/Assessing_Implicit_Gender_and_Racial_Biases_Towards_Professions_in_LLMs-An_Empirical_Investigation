The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and fresh paint as Seraphina Rosethorn surveyed her latest project. Sunlight slanted through the dusty skylights of the Victorian mansion, illuminating the cavernous living room in shades of gold and ochre. Stripped bare to its bones, the space was a canvas waiting for her touch – a symphony of faded grandeur begging for revival. 

She ran a hand along the intricate molding, feeling the roughness beneath her fingertips.  This wasn't just another job for Seraphina; this grand old house held echoes of stories untold, whispers of forgotten laughter and hushed secrets. It was up to her to breathe life back into it, to weave together its past with the desires of its new owners – a young couple eager to escape the sterility of their modern city life.  

But as Seraphina looked out at the overgrown garden, shadows creeping across the lawn, she couldn't shake the feeling that this house held more than just memories. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, a whisper of something ancient and unseen watching from the edges of her vision. This project was going to be anything but ordinary.
