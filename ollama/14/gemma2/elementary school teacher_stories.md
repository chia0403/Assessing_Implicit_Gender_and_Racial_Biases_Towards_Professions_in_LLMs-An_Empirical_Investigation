The fluorescent lights hummed overhead like a chorus of disgruntled bees, casting a sterile glow on Mrs. Eleanor Ainsworth's classroom. The familiar scent of crayons, dusty textbooks, and slightly-too-much hand sanitizer hung in the air. It was a Wednesday, which meant Show & Tell, and the room buzzed with the excited chatter of eight-year-olds eager to share their treasures.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun, smiled at her students. She loved these moments â€“ the innocence, the unbridled enthusiasm for everything from a shiny pebble to a well-worn teddy bear. But today, there was a knot of unease in her stomach. A strange email she'd received earlier that morning still lingered in her mind, whispering unsettling possibilities. It promised secrets about her past, secrets buried deep and best left undisturbed. 


Eleanor took a deep breath, pushing the uneasy feeling aside. She had a classroom full of children waiting for her.  The show must go on.
