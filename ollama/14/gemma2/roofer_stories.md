The sun beat down on Elias Finnigan's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning the tar paper under his boots to sizzling asphalt.  He wiped a bead of sweat from his brow, cursing the audacity of the July heat in Boston. It wasn't just the weather that was making him miserable; it was Mrs. O'Malley and her incessant chirping about the "aesthetic appeal" of moss growing on the north side of her roof. 

Elias was all for natural beauty, but when that beauty threatened to turn his shingles into a soggy sponge, well, then it was time to call in the heavy artillery. He surveyed the problem, a tangled mass of emerald green creeping across the rooftop like a verdant plague.  Mrs. O'Malley had insisted on keeping her ancient oak tree for sentimental reasons, and Elias suspected that was the source of the problem. Roots snaked through the eaves, and moss thrived in the damp shade cast by its sprawling branches. It was going to be a long day.  


**Setting:** A steep, gabled Victorian home in Boston's West End neighborhood, circa 1950. The house is surrounded by overgrown gardens, testament to Mrs. O'Malley's stubborn affection for the past.
