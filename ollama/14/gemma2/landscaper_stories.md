The morning sun cast long shadows across Bartholomew "Bart" Willow's worn leather work gloves as he surveyed his latest canvas: Mrs. Clementine Hawthorne's sprawling Victorian garden in its usual state of delightful disarray. Vines had strangled the ornate trellis, roses choked out delicate ferns, and a rogue patch of sunflowers threatened to engulf the meticulously crafted rockery. 

Bart sighed, feeling a familiar thrill course through him. This wasn't just tidying up; it was alchemy. He saw potential where others saw chaos, order hidden beneath layers of unruly beauty. His tools – the pruners, trowel, and shears – felt like extensions of himself, ready to coax life into harmony.  The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and blooming jasmine, a symphony that only intensified Bart's connection to this forgotten world he was about to reclaim.
