The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Elara Beatrice Finch’s head, casting a sickly yellow glow across her cramped office. Papers were piled high on every surface, their contents a labyrinthine mix of receipts, W-2s, and 1099s – the detritus of tax season. Elara, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun and spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, squinted at a particularly convoluted form, her brow furrowed in concentration.  

The smell of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma in this small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Outside, snow was falling softly, blanketing everything in a hushed silence that contrasted sharply with the frantic energy inside Elara's office.
