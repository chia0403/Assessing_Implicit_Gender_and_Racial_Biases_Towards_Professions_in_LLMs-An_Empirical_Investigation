The scent of sawdust, iron, and something undeniably *alive* clung to Elias Thornwood like a second skin. He moved through his shop, "Thornwood's Provisions," with the practiced grace of a dancer, his worn leather apron dusted with a fine layer of crimson from the day's work. The air hung thick with the rhythmic thump of his cleaver against the butcher block and the low murmur of customers haggling over cuts of beef, pork, and lamb.

Elias wasn't just a butcher; he was a craftsman, an artist of flesh and bone. He saw the stories in each carcass, the lives lived and the journeys taken, etched into every muscle and marbling. His shop, nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of Newhaven's bustling market district, was more than just a place to buy meat; it was a sanctuary for those seeking solace in the primal rhythm of life and death. 

But beneath the familiar hum of commerce, a new undercurrent pulsed. The usual chatter was punctuated by hushed whispers, eyes darting nervously between each other. A tremor of unease had settled over Newhaven, fueled by rumors of strange creatures lurking in the city's shadows. Elias, however, remained focused on his work, his calloused hands wielding the cleaver with unwavering precision. He believed in facing the unknown head-on, just like he faced every beast that walked into his shop.
