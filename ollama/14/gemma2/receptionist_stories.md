The morning sun, a pale imitation of its usual self, cast weak fingers through the dusty blinds, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. Eleanor Josephine Bellweather adjusted her posture, attempting to reclaim some semblance of professional grace from the slump that came with another long night at the Grand Blackwood Hotel. The faded grandeur of the building, once a jewel of the city, now reflected in the tired lines around Eleanor’s eyes. 

The lobby was hushed, the usual morning bustle absent. It was a Tuesday, but even Tuesdays usually had their share of weary travelers checking in after late flights or locals stopping for coffee and a slice of Mrs. Periwinkle's legendary blueberry pie (though Eleanor suspected that fame was as much about Mrs. Periwinkle's handlebar mustache as it was the pie itself). Today, the silence felt thick with anticipation, like a storm brewing beneath the surface. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and something else, something faintly metallic and unsettling.  Eleanor’s hand tightened on the worn receiver of her vintage rotary phone, waiting for the day to unravel, wondering if it would be a Tuesday that was just…off, or something much more sinister.
