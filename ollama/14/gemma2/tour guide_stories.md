The midday sun beat down on Petra's face, turning her freckled nose even more crimson than usual. Sweat trickled down her temple, mingling with the dust kicked up by the throng of tourists trailing behind her. 

Petra Amelia Bellweather adjusted her straw hat, squinting at the impressive facade of the Treasury carved into the sandstone cliffs. "And here we are," she announced in her bright, chirpy voice, "The most famous sight in Jordan! A true marvel of Nabataean architecture..."

Her words were drowned out by a chorus of camera shutters and excited chatter. Petra rolled her eyes, accustomed to this kind of enthusiasm. It was just another Tuesday for the most popular tour guide in all of Wadi Musa. The vibrant red canyons, ancient tombs, and winding pathways held endless fascination for the tourists, but for Petra, it was home. Every crack in the sandstone, every whisper of wind through the Siq, told a story she knew by heart. 


Despite the predictable routine, there was always something new to discover. Sometimes, a forgotten inscription would catch her eye, revealing a forgotten tale. Other times, a child's innocent question about the desert stars would spark a moment of unexpected wonder. And today, as Petra led her group through the bustling Siq, she had a feeling that this particular day wouldn't be just another Tuesday.
