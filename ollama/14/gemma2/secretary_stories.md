The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Periwinkle's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the stacks of paperwork on her desk. Outside, the rain lashed against the windows of the towering corporate headquarters, mimicking the frantic tapping of Amelia's fingers against her keyboard. She was drowning in emails, spreadsheets, and meeting requests, all vying for her attention like hungry sharks circling a wounded seal.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. This wasn't exactly how she envisioned spending her Monday morning.

Amelia yearned for something more than filing expense reports and scheduling conference calls. She dreamt of weaving words into captivating stories, of crafting novels that transported readers to faraway lands and introduced them to characters both relatable and unforgettable.
