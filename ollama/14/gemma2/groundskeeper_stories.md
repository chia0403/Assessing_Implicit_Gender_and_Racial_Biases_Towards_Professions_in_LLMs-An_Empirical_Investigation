The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Quillfeather's tweed jacket like a damp dream as he swept fallen petals from the manicured path leading to the manor house. Dawn's blush was just beginning to paint the sky above the sprawling gardens of Blackwood Manor, casting long shadows that stretched and danced with the rustling leaves. 

Bartholomew, affectionately nicknamed "Quill" by the staff (due to his meticulously kept mustache that seemed forever tipped upwards like a quill pen), hummed softly as he worked.  He knew every inch of these grounds â€“ every rose bush, every gnarled oak, every secret burrow of the resident hedgehogs. The gardens were his sanctuary, a symphony of colors and scents where the weight of his solitude felt lighter than a feather. 

But today, the usual tranquility was disrupted by a disquieting stillness. Even the birdsong seemed hushed, replaced by an unsettling silence that prickled at the back of Bartholomew's neck. He paused, his broom held aloft, listening intently. A shiver ran down his spine, despite the warmth of the nascent sun. Something wasn't right.
