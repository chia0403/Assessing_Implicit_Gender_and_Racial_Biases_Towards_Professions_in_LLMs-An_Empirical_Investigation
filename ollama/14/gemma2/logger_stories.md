The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, a familiar perfume that Elias Blackwood inhaled deeply as he surveyed his domain. Sunlight filtered through the towering redwoods, painting dappled patterns on the forest floor where he stood. A symphony of birdsong filled the air, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of an axe striking wood – a melody Elias knew better than any lullaby.

He was born into this world, raised amongst these giants, his calloused hands and weathered face testaments to a life spent wrestling with nature's raw power. He was a logger, through and through, and the redwood forest, stretching as far as the eye could see, was his kingdom. 


Elias adjusted the straps of his worn leather pack, feeling the familiar weight of tools – axe, saw, wedges – that were extensions of himself. Today's task: felling a majestic Sitka spruce, its branches reaching towards the heavens like yearning arms. It wasn't an easy job, demanding both physical strength and a deep understanding of the forest's intricate balance. But Elias found solace in the work, a sense of purpose in shaping this wild landscape with his own hands.
