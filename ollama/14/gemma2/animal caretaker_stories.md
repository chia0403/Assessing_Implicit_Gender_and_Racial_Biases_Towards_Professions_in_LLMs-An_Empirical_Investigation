The humid air hung heavy in Willow Creek Wildlife Sanctuary, thick with the smell of hay and damp earth. Sunlight dripped through the gaps in the canvas roof of the barn, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness.  Eliza Amelia Hawthorne, or Eliza as everyone called her, ran a calloused hand over the soft fur of a sleepy brown hare, its nose twitching as it nestled deeper into her palm. She hummed softly, the melody a lullaby familiar to every creature under her care.

It was a Monday morning, and like any other day at Willow Creek, Eliza's schedule was packed.  A newborn fox pup needed bottle feeding, a flock of rescued pigeons required their usual morning scattering of millet, and the resident sloth, Bartholomew, had a vet appointment for his annual check-up. 


But this Monday held a different weight to it. A thick envelope lay on the table beside Eliza, its official seal promising news that could change everything at Willow Creek. She hesitated before picking it up, her heart pounding with an anxious rhythm against her ribs. The sanctuary was struggling financially, and the grant application sheâ€™d poured weeks into seemed like a long shot.  

Eliza took a deep breath, knowing that whatever lay within that envelope would determine the future of the animals she loved so dearly.
