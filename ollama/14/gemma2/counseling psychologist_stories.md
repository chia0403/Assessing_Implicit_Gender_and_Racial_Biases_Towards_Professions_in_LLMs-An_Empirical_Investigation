The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window, illuminating the dust motes dancing in its warm glow. Outside, the rhythmic chirping of crickets mingled with the distant hum of traffic on Highway 101, a constant soundtrack to her life in coastal California. Inside, though, it was quiet, save for the rustling of papers as Eleanor prepared for her next appointment. Her office, tucked away in a cozy building overlooking the Pacific Ocean, was a sanctuary of calm, filled with soothing earth tones, plush cushions, and the faint aroma of lavender essential oil.  Eleanor glanced at the file on her desk, its name – “Daniel Hayes” – stark against the pale blue paper. He was a young man, barely twenty-five, battling anxiety so severe it had become a cage he couldn't escape. Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for the conversation to come. She always hoped she could offer him the key, a way to unlock that cage and finally breathe freely.
