The scent of crayons and fingerpaint hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of spilled juice boxes. Sunlight streamed through the gauzy curtains, casting rainbows across the mismatched alphabet rug where little legs danced and giggled. 

It was Ms. Eloise Amelia Butterfield's favorite time of day: circle time.  Her heart swelled as she surveyed her class of twenty-five tiny humans, their eyes wide with anticipation for story time, snack time, and most importantly, singing time. Today, they were learning the song "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes," a classic that never failed to send shivers of delight down Eloise's spine. She loved her job more than words could say, even when it involved cleaning sticky fingers and calming down meltdown meltdowns.  

Eloise adjusted the tiny flower crown perched on her head – a gift from Lily, a shy girl with pigtails as bright as sunflowers – and cleared her throat. 


"Alright, my little munchkins," she chirped, "who's ready to shake our heads and tap our toes?"
