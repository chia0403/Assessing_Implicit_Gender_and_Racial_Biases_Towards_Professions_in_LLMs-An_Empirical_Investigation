The stench of brine and fish guts clung to Elias Corvus like a second skin. He'd been scrubbing at the rust-colored stains on his leather breastplate for hours, but it was a losing battle. It was just another day on the docks of Port Marazion, where grime was as much a part of life as the salt spray that whipped across the wharves.

Elias adjusted the worn brim of his cap, shielding his eyes from the harsh glare of the midday sun. He scanned the bustling scene before him: merchants hawking their wares, sailors swearing in colorful tongues, and the steady churn of carts hauling cargo up and down the narrow streets. It was a symphony of chaos, a constant reminder of why he’d chosen to be a guard – order amidst the storm. 

Today, however, Elias felt a disquiet gnawing at him. The air seemed thicker, charged with an unspoken tension. Even the usual cacophony of the docks sounded muted, as if everyone was holding their breath. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to shift, that the delicate balance of Port Marazion was about to be tipped.
