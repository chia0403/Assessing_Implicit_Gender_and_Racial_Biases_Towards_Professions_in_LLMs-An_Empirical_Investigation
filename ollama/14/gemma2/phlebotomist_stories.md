The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Beatrice Finch, casting an anemic glow over the cramped waiting room. It was always quiet in the early hours at Dr. Hemlock’s clinic – a stark contrast to the afternoon frenzy when hypochondriacs and anxious mothers converged like a swarm of nervous bees. 

Elara tapped her pen against the laminated schedule, its cheerful yellow clashing violently with the sterile white walls. She glanced at the clock: 7:02 am. Another hour until the first patient shuffled in, their pale faces etched with anxieties about their cholesterol levels or that persistent cough they'd sworn would vanish by spring. But Elara didn't mind. She found a strange solace in the predictable rhythm of it all – the prick, the draw, the gentle wave goodbye.  


The clinic itself was tucked away on a forgotten side street in a suburb where time seemed to move at half speed. Old brick buildings huddled together, their storefronts faded and weather-beaten, like weary sighs against the encroaching march of progress. Dr. Hemlock's was one such building – small, unassuming, with peeling paint and a bell that jingled merrily whenever someone entered.
