The rhythmic clatter of hooves on cobblestone echoed through Dr. Eleanor Anya O'Connell's small clinic nestled in the heart of Dublin. Outside, the air was thick with the scent of damp earth and brewing rain, a familiar aroma that always seemed to permeate the city. Rain or shine, her patients were never far behind, their needs as varied as the cobbled streets themselves – from skittish thoroughbreds awaiting pre-race checkups to aging terriers battling arthritis. 

Eleanor sighed, adjusting the worn stethoscope around her neck. Today promised to be a particularly busy one. A call from the renowned Irish Hunt had come in requesting immediate attention for their star steeplechaser, a young mare named Red Clover who'd taken a nasty fall during yesterday's practice. Eleanor knew the pressure was on; every horse owner, especially those associated with such prestigious events, demanded the best care imaginable. 


She straightened her apron, a simple white linen garment stained with countless reminders of past encounters – patches from stray cat bites, ink splatters from equine vaccination records, and even a faint outline of dried blood from a particularly harrowing case involving a runaway cart horse. This clinic was more than just a business; it was a tapestry woven with the stories of Dublin's animal residents, each one leaving its mark on Eleanor's life.
