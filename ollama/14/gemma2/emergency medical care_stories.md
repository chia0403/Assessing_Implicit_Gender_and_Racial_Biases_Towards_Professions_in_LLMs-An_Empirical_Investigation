The wail of sirens sliced through Amelia "Amy" Reyes' peaceful Friday night, ripping her from a half-forgotten dream about salsa dancing with a particularly charming patient. She was already attired in her EMS uniform, a comfortable ritual after years on the job, but she still slapped on her jacket and grabbed her bag, heart thrumming with that familiar mixture of dread and anticipation.

The call came in as "possible cardiac arrest," dispatched to a bustling downtown street market. Amy imagined a flurry of stalls, the aroma of spices hanging heavy in the air, the joyful chatter of vendors and shoppers now cut short by the urgency of her arrival.  She could almost taste the sweet mango sticky rice she’d planned to buy on her way home.

"Heads up, Amy," said her partner, Michael, a seasoned EMT with a perpetually wry grin, as they sped through the neon-lit streets. "Looks like we're about to crash this fiesta." 


The setting pulsed with life – a vibrant night market overflowing with handcrafted goods, steaming food stalls, and the lively melody of salsa music drifting from a nearby bar.  It was a scene meant for celebration, but now a dark silence had fallen over one corner, where a cluster of people huddled around an unconscious woman lying on the cobblestones.
