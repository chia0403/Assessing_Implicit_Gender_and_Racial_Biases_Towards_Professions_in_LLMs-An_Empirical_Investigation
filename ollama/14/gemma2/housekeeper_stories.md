The morning sunlight, fractured by the stained-glass panels in the front hall, painted Eleanor Beatrice Winthrop's worn boots with a mosaic of crimson and sapphire. She inhaled deeply, the scent of lilac water clinging to the air, a ghost of the grand party held the night before. The house, a Victorian behemoth perched precariously on the cliffside overlooking the churning sea, was always a whirlwind after such events.

Eleanor, her silver bun tight against her scalp and her sensible cotton dress a stark contrast to the flowing gowns she'd just laundered, surveyed the scene with practiced eyes. A trail of confetti led from the ballroom, where half-empty champagne bottles glinted on a table draped in silk that bore the faintest smear of grape juice. The grand staircase groaned under the weight of discarded feathers and broken promises. 

It was always a temporary beauty, this post-party chaos. By tonight, Eleanor would have it pristine again, each surface gleaming, every floorboard polished to a mirror finish. It was a quiet satisfaction she found in restoring order, a solace amidst the swirling lives of the wealthy residents who called this house home â€“ lives that were as fleeting and fragile as the bubbles in their champagne glasses.
