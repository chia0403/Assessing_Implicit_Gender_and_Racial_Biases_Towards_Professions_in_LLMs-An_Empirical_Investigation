The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's chiropractic clinic like a thousand tiny fists, each blow accompanied by an echo that reverberated through the small, sparsely furnished waiting room.  Evelyn herself wasn't fazed by the storm; she was used to the symphony of nature accompanying her workday in rural Hopewell, Montana. 

The scent of cedar and pine from the towering Douglas firs outside mingled with the faint aroma of lavender essential oil diffuser wafting from a nearby shelf. Evelyn idly twisted a strand of her auburn hair around her finger as she glanced at the clock â€“ 3:45 PM.  She was expecting her last patient, Mrs. Peterson, a sweet old lady who swore by Evelyn's adjustments for managing her arthritis. The rain seemed to be intensifying, and Evelyn wondered if Mrs. Peterson would brave the downpour. She hoped so; Evelyn needed the company. 


The clinic itself felt as isolated as its location: a weathered wooden building tucked away on a lonely stretch of highway, more accustomed to the whisper of wind than the rumble of human traffic. Yet, for Evelyn, it was home - a haven where she could heal bodies and souls alike, offering solace to those seeking relief from pain, both physical and emotional.
