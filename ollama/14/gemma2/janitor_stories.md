The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar shroud that cloaked Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins as he shuffled down the echoing hallway. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting long, skeletal shadows from the rows of empty lockers lining the walls. Outside, the first faint blush of dawn was creeping over the horizon, painting the city skyline in shades of lavender and grey.

Bartholomew, or Bart as everyone called him – even those who never bothered to learn his full name – pushed his cart down the hallway, its rusty wheels groaning with each turn.  Inside the metal bin, a damp rag swirled precariously, threatening to spill its contents of floor cleaner onto the linoleum. He hummed a tuneless melody, a habit he'd developed years ago to mask the silence that gnawed at him.

He was a ghost in this grand old building – a silent observer of the lives that unfolded within its walls during the day. He saw the laughter, the arguments, the triumphs and failures, all from the periphery.  But by night, it belonged to him. The janitor, the unseen hand, the keeper of secrets whispered in darkened hallways. Tonight, however, felt different. A prickling unease crawled up his spine, a sense that something was amiss. 


The city outside was awakening, but within the building's cold embrace, Bart knew something else was stirring – something he couldn't quite grasp, but wouldn’t soon forget.
