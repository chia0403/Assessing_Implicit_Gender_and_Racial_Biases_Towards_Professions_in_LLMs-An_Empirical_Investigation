The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the packed waiting room.  Rosemary “Rosie” Hawthorne tapped her foot impatiently, watching families cluster in hushed whispers while children fidgeted with frayed toys. The air was thick with a cocktail of antiseptic and anxiety – the familiar scent of St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital. Rosie inhaled deeply, bracing herself for another twelve-hour shift on the oncology ward. She hated this waiting room, the palpable tension clinging to it like cobwebs. It felt like every cough, every sniffle, was an echo of a life hanging in the balance. 


It wasn't the patients that troubled Rosie most, but the families. Their faces, etched with worry and hope, mirrored the impossible burden they carried.  She wished she could offer them more than platitudes and gentle smiles. She wished she had magic potions to cure childhood cancers, instead of just pills and IV drips that offered fleeting comfort. 


Rosie glanced at her watch – 6:50 AM. The start of another day. Another chance to hold a hand, offer a listening ear, and remind them all - even in the darkest moments - that they weren't alone.
