The air in Dr. Eleanor Hayes' office was thick with the scent of lavender and anxiety. Sunlight streamed through the blinds, illuminating dust motes dancing in the sterile space. Outside, birds chirped, oblivious to the storm brewing within these four walls.  Eleanor sat poised behind her desk, her navy blue cardigan neatly buttoned, a picture of calm composure. Her gaze was fixed on the young man across from her, his face pale and etched with worry lines that seemed too deep for someone barely out of his teens. 

He fidgeted with the frayed edge of his worn-out jeans, avoiding Eleanor's steady gaze. "I justâ€¦ I don't know what to do anymore," he finally mumbled, his voice a strangled whisper.

Eleanor leaned forward, her expression warm and inviting. "Tell me about it, Michael. What's been happening?" 


The setting is a private therapy office in a bustling city neighborhood. The office itself is fairly modern and minimalist, with white walls, hardwood floors, and comfortable furniture designed to put patients at ease. Despite the effort, the feeling of vulnerability lingers in the air.
