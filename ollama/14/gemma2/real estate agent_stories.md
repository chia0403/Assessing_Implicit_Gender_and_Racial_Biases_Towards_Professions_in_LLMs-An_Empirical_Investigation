The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of the abandoned Victorian, casting long shadows that danced across the peeling wallpaper.  Amelia "Amy" Rose Butterfield, her floral print dress clinging slightly to her damp skin from the humid August air, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. Years in the real estate business had taught her to see past the decay, to imagine the potential hidden beneath layers of neglect. 

This house, however, was proving particularly stubborn.  The scent of mildew hung heavy in the air, and cobwebs draped every corner like ghostly shrouds. The grand staircase, once a statement piece, creaked ominously with each step Amy took, threatening to give way under her weight. But beneath it all, she could sense a whisper of its former glory, a faint echo of laughter and life that resonated from the hollow walls. This house, nestled on a quiet street in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia, had been abandoned for decades. Now, Amy was tasked with breathing life back into it, bringing her client's vision to fruition. 


The challenge, she knew, would be daunting. But Amy Rose Butterfield thrived on challenges.
