The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune over Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Vance's head as she shuffled through piles of crumpled essays on her desk. The air in her classroom, room 217 at Westview High, smelled faintly of stale coffee and teenage angst. It was the last day before summer vacation, and the usual post-final exam apathy hung heavy in the air. Students slouched in their chairs, some doodling idly in their notebooks while others openly snoozed, dreaming perhaps of beaches, barbecues, and blissful freedom from equations, Shakespearean sonnets, and Ms. Vance's relentless grammar quizzes. 

Eleanor sighed. She wasn't entirely blameless for the current atmosphere. Her enthusiasm for teaching – particularly her beloved English Literature – had begun to wane. After twelve years at Westview, the thrill of igniting a spark of passion in young minds had dimmed. The endless paperwork, parental complaints, and standardized testing requirements had chipped away at her spirit like relentless waves against a rocky shore. 

She glanced out the window. A lone crow perched on the fire escape, cawing mournfully. It mirrored her own mood – weary, uninspired, and yearning for something more.
