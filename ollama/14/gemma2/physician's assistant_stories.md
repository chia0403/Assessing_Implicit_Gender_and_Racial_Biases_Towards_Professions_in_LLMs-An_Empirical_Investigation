The air in the ER hung thick with antiseptic and anxiety.  Lilac-hued surgical scrubs clung to Amelia "Amy" Carter's frame as she navigated the chaotic flow of patients. The flickering fluorescent lights cast harsh shadows across the faces etched with pain, fear, and resignation. A symphony of beeps and cries filled the room, punctuated by the barked commands of nurses and the hurried footsteps of doctors.

Amy, a physician assistant with five years under her belt, thrived in this controlled chaos. She was a calm amidst the storm, her steady hands and reassuring voice a lifeline for those swallowed whole by panic. Tonight, however, felt different. The air crackled with an unnerving energy, a sense that something was amiss, brewing beneath the surface of the usual medical mayhem. 

Her pager buzzed, jolting her from her observations.  "Trauma bay three," it read, followed by a grim statistic: "multiple gunshot wounds." 


Amy's heart pounded against her ribs, a familiar rhythm she knew well from countless adrenaline-fueled shifts. This was the reality of working in Chicago's gritty downtown district – trauma never took a break. But tonight, something felt… heavier.  She adjusted her mask and steeled herself, heading towards Trauma Bay three, prepared to face whatever horrors awaited her.
