The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and varnish in Elias Blackwood's workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature galaxies. Outside, the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer echoed from across the cobbled street, punctuated by the occasional bleating of sheep making their way to market. Elias, his brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously smoothed the edges of a hand-carved oak door, its intricate design hinting at stories yet to be told.  He hummed a tuneless melody as he worked, his calloused fingers dancing over the wood with practiced ease. 

Elias Blackwood was a man who spoke more with his tools than his words. A craftsman born and bred in the bustling port town of Saltwind, he had inherited his father's workshop and the legacy of generations of skilled carpenters before him. Each piece he created bore the imprint of his soul – sturdy, beautiful, and imbued with an unspoken promise of longevity.  

But today, a tension gnawed at Elias, a disquiet that refused to be ignored. He couldn’t quite place it, this unsettling feeling like a shadow looming over his usually peaceful workshop. It was as if the very walls themselves were holding their breath, waiting for something to happen.
