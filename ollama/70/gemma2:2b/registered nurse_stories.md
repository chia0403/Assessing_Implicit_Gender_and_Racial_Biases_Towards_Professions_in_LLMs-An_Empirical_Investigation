The air in St. Joseph’s Mercy Hospital smelled perpetually of disinfectant and hope - or perhaps that was just the lingering aftertaste of the countless surgeries that passed through this bustling city-sanctuary for the sick.  Elara Thorne, her steely blue eyes constantly scanning the emergency room floor, felt none of those sentiments as she pushed her way past a gaggle of worried relatives and into the center of chaos.  It was 3 AM, a time when the human heart was vulnerable, its rhythm flickering with fear and fatigue, but Elara’s own was steady, an anchor in the storm of patient pleas and hushed whispers.  Her nameplate, emblazoned with “Elara Thorne RN,” hung heavy on her white coat, a testament to years spent tending the wounded and whispering reassurances to those who were broken.  Tonight, however, Elara's heart had a peculiar rhythm – one that wasn’t the steady drum of the human body, but the frantic pulse of a silent alarm clock.
