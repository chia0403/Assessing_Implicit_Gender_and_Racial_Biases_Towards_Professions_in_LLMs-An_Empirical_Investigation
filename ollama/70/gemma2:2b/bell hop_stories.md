The rain hammered against the glass awning of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each drop echoing like a mournful drumbeat in the symphony of the city's nighttime chaos. Inside, nestled amongst overflowing velvet luggage racks and a chorus of tired coughs from snoring patrons, worked Felix Sterling.  He wasn’t as weary as most of the other bellhops, though, not tonight.  Felix was on his nightly pilgrimage to the rooftop bar after his shift, a ritual that helped him drown out the anxieties that simmered beneath the surface of life in this city. 

The Grand Majestic, with its ornate facade and whispered stories of forgotten loves and scandalous affairs, held a peculiar charm for Felix. He wasn't from this world, not really.  Born in a dusty, windswept town in Kansas, he’d arrived at the hotel seeking a fresh start - a chance to be someone other than the boy who'd been left behind. Here, amongst the gilded cages of opulence, he was more than just Felix Sterling; he was a magician, conjuring smiles on faces as weathered and scarred as the city itself. 


This night, though, the rooftop bar felt colder than usual. The usual jazzy melody was replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by the howling wind and his own racing pulse. Something was wrong.  Felix felt it deep within him, a discordant note in the otherwise harmonious symphony of the night. He just had to figure out where the melody was going off-key.
