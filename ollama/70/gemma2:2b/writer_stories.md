The air in Amelia Thorne’s cramped attic bedroom was thick with the scent of dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight that pierced the grimy skylight. She inhaled deeply, the familiar tang of forgotten things grounding her. Her fingers, calloused from years spent wielding a worn fountain pen like an ancient sword against the blank page, tapped out a rhythm on her battered desk. Outside, rain lashed against the old Victorian windowpane, mimicking the staccato beat of her thoughts. 

Amelia's mind was a tangled web of anxieties and half-formed ideas. Her newest novel, The Last Echo of Blackwood Manor, had stalled again.  The manor’s oppressive atmosphere, captured in meticulously detailed sketches on her worn notepad, seemed to mock her from the corner of the room. Amelia glanced at the clock, its chipped enamel face mocking her with a slow, ticking reminder: deadline looming. 


**Setting:** A gloomy Victorian attic, cluttered with old furniture and overflowing bookshelves. The only source of light is a faded skylight that lets in just a sliver of sunlight.
**Character:** Amelia Thorne, a young writer struggling to finish her latest novel, The Last Echo of Blackwood Manor.
