Rain lashed against the stained glass windows of Blackwood Manor like angry little demons, each drop exploding in shimmering diamonds on the ornate surface. Inside, Agatha Featherstone, her wrinkled hands clutching a chipped teacup, felt the chill seeping through the thick velvet curtains and into her bones.  The storm had been raging for hours, an unrelenting symphony of wind and water that echoed the turmoil brewing inside the old house itself. This was Blackwood Manor, a place steeped in whispers of forgotten grandeur, where ghosts lingered like cobwebs in the dim corners, and secrets clung to the worn mahogany furniture as if they were breathing.

Agatha, whose life had been woven into the very fabric of this decaying monument, had grown accustomed to its unsettling aura. Years she'd spent here, tending to the whims of the absent Mrs. Blackwood, who was rumored to have passed on but whose ghostly presence lingered like a faded perfume in the air.  Every creak of the floorboards, every sigh of wind through the ancient windows, whispered stories Agatha could only decipher from her decades-old memories. 

But tonight, something felt different. A chill that went beyond the usual dampness of Blackwood Manor pierced her bones and sent a tremor down her spine. As she gazed out at the swirling storm outside, Agatha's eyes caught sight of something shimmering in the reflection of the rain-streaked glass:  a single feather, impossibly vibrant in its unnatural color - emerald green and flecked with silver. A strange, almost otherworldly sensation prickled her skin. Tonight, the air itself felt charged, as if the very walls of Blackwood Manor were holding their breath.
