The mahogany desk felt smooth under Amelia's fingers as she adjusted her pen, its weight familiar in her hand.  Her reflection stared back from the polished surface: Amelia Sterling, impeccably groomed with perfectly coiffed auburn hair and a smile that was a little too forced for comfort. Across from her on the plush leather of the executive chair sat Mr. Thorne, his stern expression like an unyielding storm cloud. 

The air in the office, usually charged with the hum of ambition and whispered negotiations, hung thick with silence. The city lights below were a blur, but in this moment, it felt like they were staring back at Amelia through the glass window, judging her every move. This wasn't just another day as Amelia's usual self, orchestrating meetings and managing Mr. Thorne's schedule. Today was different. Today, there was something else brewing beneath the surface of their routine, a storm she couldn't quite name.
