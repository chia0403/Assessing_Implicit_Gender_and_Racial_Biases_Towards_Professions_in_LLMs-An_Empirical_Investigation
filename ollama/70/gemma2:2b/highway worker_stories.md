The asphalt shimmered under the midday sun, baking the air thick and heavy.  Sweat stung Edgar "Gator" Grimshaw's eyes as he wiped his forehead with a grimy rag.  His worn-down work boots kicked up dust on the newly laid section of road, the harsh glare reflecting off the glint of his steel-toed safety shoes. Gator was a highway worker for the past 15 years, and this stretch of interstate felt like an unyielding obstacle â€“ miles upon miles of endless blacktop stretching before him. His lunch break was a welcome respite, the shade of a single metal shed offering a brief escape from the relentless sun and the humdrum of labor.

He opened his battered thermos and the pungent aroma of instant beef stew filled his nostrils. Gator took a big gulp, hoping to ward off the gnawing hunger that was slowly settling in his stomach. The day had been monotonous; patching potholes, fixing drainage issues, and battling rogue tumbleweeds that seemed determined to disrupt even the most meticulously laid stretches of asphalt. 

He'd just finished adding another layer of sealant when a low, rumbling sound reached his ears.  The earth beneath him groaned under the weight of a hidden secret. Gator squinted, adjusting his safety glasses as he glanced towards the distant horizon, a flicker of anticipation burning in his eyes.
