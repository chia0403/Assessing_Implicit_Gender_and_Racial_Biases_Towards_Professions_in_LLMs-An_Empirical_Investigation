The afternoon sun slanted through the windows, turning Amelia Sinclair's workspace into a golden mosaic. She ran her fingers over the smooth surface of the kinetic sculpture by her desk -  a kaleidoscope of metal gears and polished wood that whirred gently with each shift in the light. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and fresh cedarwood from the new patient's case file, a familiar aroma for Amelia but one she found strangely comforting. 

Today’s patient was an old man named Walter Evans, his eighty years etched into his face as much as the wrinkles around his eyes. He sat on the edge of the ergonomic chair in Amelia's treatment room, arms folded tightly against himself like a worried bird about to take flight.  Amelia glanced down at the file, the details of Walter's fall and subsequent recovery laid out before her: fractured hip, limited mobility, and a deep-seated fear of re-injury. The words “functional independence” danced before Amelia’s eyes as she prepared for their session. 

It was more than just physical limitations that troubled Walter; it was the loss of autonomy, the feeling of being reduced to a frail shadow of his former self.  Amelia knew this. She understood the deep-rooted fear in her patient's heart, the unspoken terror of losing control over even the simplest tasks. And as she sat down next to him, ready to meet Walter’s gaze with hers, she felt the responsibility of helping him reclaim not just his physical freedom, but also the spirit that lay dormant beneath.
