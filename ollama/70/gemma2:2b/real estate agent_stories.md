## The Price of Sunset

**Setting:**  Sunset Vista, a charming seaside town nestled along the Oregon coast. Its Victorian-era buildings are perched precariously on cliffside, with views that stretch across the Pacific to the misty peaks of Mount Hood. It's a place where time seems to slow down, and whispers of its past linger like sea salt in the wind.

**Character:**  Evelyn Thorne, a young real estate agent known for her sharp wit and even sharper eyes. She's built an empire selling homes within Sunset Vista's coveted districts, but now she’s facing a challenge:  a dilapidated Victorian mansion on the cliffside, rumored to be haunted. 

**Story Opening:**

Evelyn traced her fingers along the weathered wood of the grand entry door, its brass hinges groaning under the pressure of time. "This," she mused aloud, the salty air whipping through her hair, "is a tragedy waiting to happen." The mansion loomed before her - its faded paint peeling like sunburnt skin, ivy crawling up its crumbling facade. Locals whispered stories of Amelia Hawthorne, a woman who vanished from this very house years ago, leaving behind a legacy that seemed woven into the very fabric of Sunset Vista's history. 

Evelyn knew why she had taken on the challenge - not for the money, but for the story.  She was drawn to the mystery, the echoes of Amelia’s past whispering in the salty winds. As she stepped inside, a gust of cold air hit her, and she swore she heard the faint echo of a woman's laughter, as old as time itself. 


**Possible Next Steps:**

* Evelyn begins investigating the mansion’s history.
* She encounters strange occurrences that defy logic - ghostly apparitions, flickering lights, and unexplained noises.
* The story could explore themes of family secrets, hidden agendas, and the price of preserving the past. 
*  Will Evelyn unravel the truth behind Amelia's disappearance? Or will she be consumed by the very house that holds her future in its grasp?
