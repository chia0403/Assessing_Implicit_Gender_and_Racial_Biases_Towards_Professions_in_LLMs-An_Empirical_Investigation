Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of Detective Mallory Thorne's office, each drop like a miniature hammer blow on the already precarious glass facade. Outside, the city was shrouded in an oily grey curtain â€“ a reflection of the grime and despair that clung to every inch of this forgotten corner of New Haven.  

Mallory ran his fingers across the worn leather of his fedora, a gesture as familiar as breathing. His sharp eyes, framed by thick brows, scanned the file lying open on his desk. The name "Evelyn Beaumont" was printed in bold letters like a crimson warning sign. It wasn't her case that made Mallory squint at it, but the cryptic note accompanying it - a single black raven feather clutched to the photo of a woman with eyes as blue as glacial ice and lips painted a shade of red that screamed danger.

**Setting:** A dilapidated, rain-soaked corner office in New Haven, Connecticut. 

**Main Character:** Mallory Thorne, a private detective known for his grit, cynicism, and a penchant for solving mysteries with an old-school charm that few could match. He'd been at this game long enough to know the city was full of secrets as slippery as grease on a cold day, but the mystery of Evelyn Beaumont held him captive - a challenge he couldn't refuse.
