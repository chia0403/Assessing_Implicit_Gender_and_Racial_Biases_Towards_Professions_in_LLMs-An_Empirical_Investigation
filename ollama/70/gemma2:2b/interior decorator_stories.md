The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and old wood polish in Celeste Beaumont's latest project.  A sprawling Victorian mansion on Sunset Lane was about to be reborn – or rather, *redecorated* for the newest member of the Blackwood family: 10-year-old Penelope. A mischievous glint danced behind her thick, curly blonde lashes as she stood perched on the velvet chaise lounge in Celeste's office, her tiny hand gripping a delicate porcelain doll like it might vanish if she let go.

"Don't you just love this little lady?" Celeste asked, gesturing to the miniature Penelope with the elegant flourish of a practiced artist. The room was a symphony of soft creams and deep blues, each piece carefully curated to complement the vintage furniture: an antique armoire that held secrets whispered in the hushed nights, a mahogany desk covered in a patchwork of fabric and lace – a tangible legacy of time passed. 

"I'm gonna make her a crown!" Penelope exclaimed, a wide grin spreading across her face as she clutched the doll tighter. "A real one, with glitter!" 


**Setting:**  An opulent, yet slightly dusty office inside Celeste Beaumont's design firm in the heart of San Francisco’s historic Victorian district.
