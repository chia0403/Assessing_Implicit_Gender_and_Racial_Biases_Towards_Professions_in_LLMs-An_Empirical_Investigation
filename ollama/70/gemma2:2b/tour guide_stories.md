She pointed at the crumbling archway etched into the hillside, a faded mosaic of turquoise and ochre against the encroaching jungle green. "Welcome to the Temple of Eira," she declared in a voice thick with the echoes of countless stories. "Legends whisper this was once home to the ancient Druids, their whispers carried on the wind."

The setting was the hidden heart of the Emerald Archipelago, an archipelago of lush islands woven together by misty sea currents and guarded by ancient spirits. The Temple itself, shrouded in mystery, lay nestled within a grove of towering kapok trees, their fronds groaning like tired giants under the relentless sun.

But as Anya began her tale, an unsettling quiet settled over the group, a silent understanding that something more than ancient lore was about to unfold.
