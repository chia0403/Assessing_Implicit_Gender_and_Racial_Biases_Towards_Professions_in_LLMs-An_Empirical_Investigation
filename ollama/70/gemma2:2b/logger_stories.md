## The Blackwood's Bite

The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A low rumble echoed through the ancient forest, not from thunder but the steady drone of chain saws echoing off the towering pines.  Dust motes danced in the hazy light filtering down through the canopy as **Jasper Thorne** stood at the edge of a particularly gnarled stand of timber, his weathered hands gripping a hickory handle that felt worn smooth with years of use. He was a veteran logger, a son of these woods, and they knew his every creak and groan.

His face, etched with wrinkles like the bark of an old oak, held a stoicism born from a lifetime spent battling nature's fury. Jasper was the kind of man who would tell you straight to your face that he loved the forest, even as it devoured him in its own way. The Blackwood Forest had always been his refuge, and now, as years wore on, it felt more like a cage than an embrace. 

The silence before the symphony of saw blades was broken by a sharp crackle.  A twig snapped underfoot, sending a tremor through Jasper's spine. The shadows deepened in the forest's dim light, twisting into monstrous shapes that danced upon the periphery of his vision. He drew on years of honed instincts; a veteran of countless battles with nature's hidden dangers. His heart beat a steady rhythm against the silence, his eyes searching for the source of the disturbance.
