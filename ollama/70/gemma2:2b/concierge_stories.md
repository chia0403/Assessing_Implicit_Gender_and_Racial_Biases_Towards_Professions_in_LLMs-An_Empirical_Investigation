##  The Grand Mirage

**Setting:** The opulent world of Belle Vue Manor, nestled in the heart of Paris's historic arrondissement. 

Built in the late 19th century by a renowned architect who took inspiration from ancient Roman mosaics and Egyptian carvings, the manor houses over three generations of esteemed families. Each room boasts breathtaking detail - ornate marble fireplaces, hand-blown crystal chandeliers, antique tapestries woven with scenes of pastoral life -  all breathing an air of timeless elegance. 

**Character:**  Camille Dubois, a woman as elegant and refined as the manor itself. For years, she's held the coveted position of concierge at Belle Vue Manor, her calm demeanor and sharp wit a familiar presence in the bustling halls. Her heart, however, yearns for something more than the endless stream of social engagements and the drudgery of domestic affairs. She reads dusty historical accounts and sketches fantastical creatures in her free time, daydreaming of a life beyond the confines of Belle Vue's gilded cage. 


**Opening:**

"Madame Dubois," whispered Eleanor, the mistress of the manor, her voice barely audible above the gentle tinkling of the grand piano. "You know better than anyone that Mr. Thorne expects us to have everything ready for the unveiling tomorrow."  

Camille sighed, swirling a delicate iced tea in her hands. Her eyes, the color of polished obsidian, fixed on the bustling scene unfolding before her - guests arriving in their finest attire, whispering amongst themselves, and the air thick with anticipation. It was the most thrilling yet terrifying time of year at Belle Vue: the unveiling of the latest architectural marvel by the enigmatic and reclusive Mr. Thorne.

For years, she'd been responsible for keeping his eccentric world functioning smoothly. Tonight, however, Camille felt an unexpected flutter in her chest, a feeling that transcended even the usual pre-revelation jitters. She glanced at the clock on the antique mantlepiece, its pendulum slowly marking the passing hours. 

The unveiling was mere hours away, and the air hummed with anticipation. But for Camille, this night felt different. Something in Mr. Thorne’s recent silence, a peculiar coldness she hadn't encountered before, made her senses heighten – an unsettling tension that ran deeper than usual. A question lingered in her mind, one that whispered from beneath layers of polite conversation and social graces:  **what exactly was hidden beneath the facade of grandeur at Belle Vue Manor?**
