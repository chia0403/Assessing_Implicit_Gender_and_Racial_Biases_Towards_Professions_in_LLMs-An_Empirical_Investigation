## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Thorne's small clinic, each drop echoing through the cramped space like tiny hammers on wood.  The air inside hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and a lingering sense of melancholy that Amelia couldn’t shake off. Her patient, Mrs. Evans, sat by the window, her thin frame hunched over like a withered tree in the storm. A year ago, Mrs. Evans had been vibrant, full of life, running her pottery studio with her daughter - a whirlwind of clay and laughter that filled the entire space. Now, Mrs. Evans was a shell of her former self, trapped within the confines of pain after her stroke, each day a slow, painstaking climb back to a semblance of normalcy. 

Amelia’s heart ached for the woman. She knew what it meant to lose control over one's body, to watch its power ebb and flow like the tide.  As she gently guided Mrs. Evans through the exercises, the rain outside seemed to mirror the slow, methodical rhythm of her work - an endless cycle of pain and potential, hope and despair. 

**Setting:** A small, cozy clinic nestled in a quiet suburban street, its windows facing the relentless downpour. The air inside is filled with the scent of disinfectant and a lingering sense of loss.


 **Main Character:** Amelia Thorne, a dedicated physical therapist driven by a deep empathy for her patients' struggles.
