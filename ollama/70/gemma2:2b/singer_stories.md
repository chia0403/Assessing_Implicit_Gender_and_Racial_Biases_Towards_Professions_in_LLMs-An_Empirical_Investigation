The smoky haze hung thick in the air, clinging to Elara's throat as she blew into her microphone. The stage lights were too bright, the crowd too loud, but beneath the cacophony hummed a familiar rhythm - the pulse of her soul. Tonight was her first show back after six months away, and every note that tumbled from her lips was laced with an unspoken grief, a longing for the freedom she'd traded in for a life of stage lights and fleeting fame.

She poured her soul into every note, trying to bridge the gap between the sorrow she felt and the melody that seemed to rise above it all.
