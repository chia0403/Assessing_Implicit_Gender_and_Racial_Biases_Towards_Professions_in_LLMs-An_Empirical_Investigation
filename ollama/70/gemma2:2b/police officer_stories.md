Rain lashed against the window of Detective Marcus "Mac" Riley's dimly lit office, each drop exploding like miniature fireworks in the flickering gaslight. The scent of stale coffee mingled with something distinctly metallic, like blood and ozone, clinging to the air. Mac ran his calloused hand over his weary face, the lines etched by years of chasing ghosts and chasing down bad guys. Outside, the city pulsed a frantic rhythm – sirens wailing their incessant song, reflections dancing on the wet asphalt. Tonight, it was the rhythm that would keep him awake, drumming in the back of his mind as he stared at the photo clutched tightly in his hand. 

This wasn't just another crime scene, not another dead body littering the city streets like discarded confetti. It was personal. A case that had been handed to him with a chilling weight and an unyielding air of finality – the disappearance of Ms. Evelyn Thorne, a prominent art dealer whose life seemed to have been erased from existence as if she'd simply vanished into thin air.  Her opulent apartment, once a sanctuary of vibrant colors and artistic expression, was now a stark monument to her sudden absence – everything clean but chillingly empty.
