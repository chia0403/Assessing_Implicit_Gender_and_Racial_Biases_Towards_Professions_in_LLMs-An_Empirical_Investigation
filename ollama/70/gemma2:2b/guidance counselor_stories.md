The rain hammered against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Caldwell's office, each drop echoing like a drumbeat in the otherwise silent room.  Eleanor sighed, peering out at the blurry grey cityscape beyond the pane.  For years, she'd navigated the tumultuous waters of adolescence with ease, her calming voice and reassuring aura acting as anchors for countless anxious freshmen trying to find their footing. But today, something was different. 

The aroma of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the usual earthy notes from freshly ground beans.  Her gaze swept over the worn leather couch where she normally sat, her notepad and pen resting on an otherwise empty surface.  She hadn't even thought about starting the weekly "Connect Time" session until the steady, insistent ring of the clock in the corner signaled a quarter past eight. The bell was jarringly loud this morning - a harsh reminder that life, like a runaway train, was hurtling toward its inevitable destination, and she couldn't stop it. 

Eleanorâ€™s name echoed through the room as she glanced at her reflection in the glass desk; her normally crisp grey suit looked stiff and oddly somber under the dim fluorescent light.  Her usual optimism seemed to have been replaced by an unsettling weight that pressed down on her chest like a trapped bird, ready to burst out of its cage. 

She was about to start another session when the door creaked open, revealing a figure shrouded in shadow and drenched in rain. It was Ethan Carter, and his arrival sent a jolt of electricity through Eleanor's heart.  This boy had been her most challenging case. He had a sullen demeanor, a disconnection that seemed to radiate from him like an invisible fog.
