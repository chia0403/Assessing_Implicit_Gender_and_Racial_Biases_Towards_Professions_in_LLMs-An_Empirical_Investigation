## The Withering Garden

**Setting:**  A quaint, seaside town nestled in the crook of a rolling green cliff, overlooking the churning expanse of the North Sea. It's October, and the air hangs crisp with salt spray and the promise of rain. 

**Character:** Elara Blackwood, an artisan florist with hair the colour of raven feathers and eyes that hold the deep blue of storm clouds.  She runs "The Withering Bloom," a tiny floral shop tucked between a dusty antique store and a creaky fishmongers. Her hands are calloused from years spent working with fragile petals and sturdy roots, her spirit as resilient as the hardy blooms she cultivates.

**Opening:** 

Elara's breath caught in her throat as she looked out the window of her shop.  It was always this way at dusk â€“ a melancholic symphony played out against the backdrop of the setting sun. The sky bled from crimson to purple, then to the deepest, most impenetrable blue. Tonight, it seemed like the sea itself had dipped its hand into the canvas, swirling the colours until they were all but indistinguishable.  Her fingers traced the delicate grooves etched onto a worn wooden stool; she was used to this feeling, this yearning for something beyond the confines of her shop. 

"It's just like you," Elara muttered to herself, the words as familiar and comfortable as breathing. "So full of life and yet so...lonely."  She straightened, tucking a stray strand of hair behind her ear. The storm was brewing, not in the sky but within her soul. A single wild rose, its petals kissed with crimson fire, lay abandoned at the base of a nearby tree. Elara picked it up, holding it to her face as if she could inhale its melancholy scent and somehow carry it into the depths of her heart.  

"Sometimes," she whispered, "you just need a little help to bloom again."
