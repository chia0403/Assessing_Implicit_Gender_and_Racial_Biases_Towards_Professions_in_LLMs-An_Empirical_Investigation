## The Weight of Wings

**Setting:** A sweltering afternoon in New Delhi.  The air hangs thick and heavy, burdened by the humidity clinging to every surface and person, even as a biting wind whips through the ancient alleyways.  A cacophony of honking horns and shouting vendors permeates the air, punctuated only occasionally by the whirring of motorcycles and the distant rumble of traffic.

**Main Character:**  Astra Naik, Captain of 'The Phoenix', an aging but reliable aircraft that echoes the stubborn spirit of its pilot.  Astra navigated the chaotic cityscape with a calmness that belied her restless heart. Years of flying through turbulent skies had hardened her features, etched deep lines around eyes that seemed to hold both the promise and the burden of countless stories waiting to be told. 

Astra leaned against the worn metal railing of the cockpit, the aroma of burnt coffee filling the small space.  The engine hummed beneath her hands as she ran a calloused thumb over the control stick - a familiar dance of power and precision.  She was leaving for the skies above the Himalayas, where the snow-laden peaks seemed to touch the very clouds. It was a pilgrimage, but one that felt less like prayer and more like a forced flight; each day in Delhi was an unspoken struggle against the weight of expectations, the pressure of duty, and the ghost of her past. 

**Opening:**

"Five minutes to departure," Astra murmured into the microphone, her voice barely audible above the city's cacophony.  A flicker of light played on the weathered wooden dashboard â€“ the sun was setting over the bustling metropolis, casting long shadows that stretched like veins across the crumbling buildings. The thought of soaring above the chaos, leaving behind the suffocating air of Delhi for a taste of freedom and silence, filled her with an uneasy mix of longing and trepidation.  The weight of her wings felt heavy tonight, not from the burden of her past but from the ever-present expectation to fly higher than ever before.
