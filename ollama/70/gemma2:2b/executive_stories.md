## Story Opening

Rain hammered against the glass windows of CEO Arthur Worthington's office, each drop echoing like thunder in the vast space.  Outside, the city of Nova Vista glittered with an angry neon glow, reflecting the chaos swirling inside him. He swirled his amber cocktail, a bitter concoction that tasted like disappointment and unfulfilled potential. 

Arthur Worthington, head honcho of Worthington Industries for the last three decades, felt like he'd been swimming in a whirlpool of self-doubt ever since the board meeting earlier that day. The board had voted down his latest proposal for a radical restructuring of their flagship project â€“ Project Phoenix, a daring attempt to merge their renewable energy sector with cutting-edge AI technology. 

"Phoenix can burn," he muttered, swirling the drink in his glass.  His fingers tightened around the rim, knuckles white against the smooth surface. "But it's not going to just vanish."
