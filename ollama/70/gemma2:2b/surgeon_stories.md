Rain hammered against the windowpane, mimicking the chaotic throb in Dr. Amelia Grant’s chest. The sterile scent of antiseptic clung to her scrubs as thick as the fog rolling in from the Thames. It was one of those days where even the fluorescent lights felt dimmer, and the faces of the anxious patients reflected a similar weariness. Her clinic, tucked away in an old Victorian building on London's fringes, was usually filled with hope – the kind that came with a doctor’s visit, a new life, or maybe just a band-aid for a boo-boo. But today, it felt heavy with the weight of something far more profound.

Amelia adjusted her surgical mask, staring at the waiting room's single floral armchair where she knew Mrs. Davies would be perched, hands clasped tightly in her lap. The air hung thick with anticipation and dread, leaving Amelia feeling strangely detached from the purpose for which she’d chosen this path: to save lives, mend broken bodies, and alleviate suffering.  Yet, today, it was all about navigating a labyrinth of hope and despair, where even the sharpest scalpel wouldn't be enough to soothe the raw nerves that throbbed beneath her skin.
