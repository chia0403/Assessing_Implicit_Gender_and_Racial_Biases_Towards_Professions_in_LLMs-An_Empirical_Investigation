## Setting: 

The old Victorian building stood hunched against the encroaching city like an arthritic giant. Its faded grandeur was marred by peeling paint, cracked windows, and a rusted wrought-iron gate that creaked open with a protest only heard by the wind itself. The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the weak afternoon light filtering through the grime-caked skylight. This was The Obsidian Quill, a bookstore whose shelves held more stories than its exterior suggested, though few patrons dared to step inside. 

## Character:

**Eleanor "Ellie" Hawthorne** ran her fingers nervously across the worn wooden countertop of her desk in the heart of the building.  Her name tag read "Ellie", an echo of her grandmother's who had been a beloved part of this bookstore for years before passing away only last week. Now, Ellie was the sole witness to its continued survival, armed with her grandfather's dusty photo albums and the quiet hum of the antique typewriter on her desk. 

**Story Opening:**

A bell above the door chimed as a gust of wind whipped through the open window, shaking loose a lone raven feather that landed on Ellie's worn gloves. The sound was barely audible over the ceaseless whisper of pages turning in the bookstore's back room. "Just another customer," Ellie muttered to herself, though her gaze drifted towards the door, tracing the silhouette of the approaching figure through the veil of dust motes. 

This wasn’t just any customer.  He looked like he belonged on a dusty, leather-bound map from another century – a man with eyes the color of storm clouds and hair like spun silver that flowed over his worn, dark coat. Ellie couldn't help but notice a small scar etched across his left cheekbone, barely visible under the shadow of his wide-brimmed hat.
