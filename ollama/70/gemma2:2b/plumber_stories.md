##  The Smell of Iron 

**Setting:** The rusty backstreets of New Bohemia, a city known more for its gritty underbelly than its gleaming skyscrapers. Graffiti-painted brick buildings leaned against one another like weary giants, and streetlights cast long, flickering shadows across the crumbling sidewalks.

**Main Character:** Bartholomew "Bart" Finch, a plumber with calloused hands and a face perpetually creased in thought. His tools were his only company as he navigated the labyrinth of pipes hidden beneath the city's surface – each bend, twist, and turn whispering tales of lives lived and lost. 

His latest job had brought him to the heart of the old district:  the decrepit apartment building that housed a family rumored to be involved in something far more sinister than leaky pipes and clogged drains. Bart couldn't shake off the strange feeling that he was walking into a storm, one filled with whispers and secrets. The air hung thick with a cloying scent of iron – not metallic, but earthy, as if the very walls were weeping a silent tear. 


**Opening Line:**  “There’s always something in these places,” Bart muttered, his knuckles digging into the worn leather strap of his tool belt. He wasn't sure what it was, exactly, but he could feel it - a creeping unease that tightened its grip on him with every step closer to the apartment building’s dilapidated entrance.
