The crisp air bit at Dr. Evelyn Reed's cheeks as she walked down Willow Creek Road, snow swirling around her ankles in a silent waltz.  Her worn boots crunched on the icy path leading to her office, "Reed Chiropractic & Wellness", nestled into a cozy corner of a bustling suburban town. The windows reflected the storm clouds gathering overhead, casting long shadows that stretched across the white canvas of the street.

Evelyn, ever practical, had chosen this quiet nook for her practice over the roaring city hospitals and their demanding schedules.  She’d never quite fit in there, the pressure to diagnose and prescribe a constant hum beneath the surface. Here, she could focus on the subtle shifts in her patients' bodies, coaxing them back into alignment through gentle hands and a patient ear. 

Today was different though.  A sense of unease lingered like the lingering chill of the approaching storm. The usual symphony of popping necks and relieved sighs had been replaced by an expectant silence.  Evelyn’s phone buzzed with a message from Mrs. Miller, who'd waited for years to see her. A new patient had come to town. One who claimed he could offer "an alternative solution" to Evelyn’s conventional methods.
