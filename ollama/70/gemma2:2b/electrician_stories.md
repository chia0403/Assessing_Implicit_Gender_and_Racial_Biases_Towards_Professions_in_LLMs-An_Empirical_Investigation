## Opening: 

Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of **Reginald “Reggie” Finch’s** van, each gust of wind sounding like a guttural scream. The small space, usually filled with the comforting hum of tools and the familiar smell of solder, was suffocatingly claustrophobic. Reggie hunched deeper into his worn leather seat, battling the damp chill that seeped in from the gaps between the rusty panels.  Outside, the town of Oakhaven huddled under a curtain of grey. 

**Setting:**

Oakhaven is a sleepy coastal town perpetually shrouded in an eerie fog that clings to its narrow streets like a shroud. Its once-vibrant harbour now lay abandoned save for a few weathered fishing boats bobbing listlessly on their moorings. The town’s only source of energy was the windmills, whose blades groaned and creaked with each gust. 

Oakhaven clung onto history, yet time seemed to have taken its toll. Buildings stood half-collapsed, some more ghostly skeletons than reminders of a past grandeur.  The old lighthouse on the cliffs, once a beacon of hope for weary travelers, now stood forlornly, its light barely visible through the thick fog.


**Main Character:**

Reginald “Reggie” Finch, known to all simply as Reggie, is a quiet, solitary man whose life had been shaped by the city’s shadows and his love for a well-working circuit.  He's seen it all: from the bustling symphony of industry to the deafening silence of abandoned factories. But even in this desolate landscape, he kept the spark alive. The whirring of his tools, a comforting symphony amidst the eerie stillness of Oakhaven.
