The air hung thick with salt spray and the scent of seaweed as Elara "Ellie" Thorne knelt amongst the chaotic beauty of the beach.  Her easel, usually anchored against the ancient, moss-covered stone wall of her studio overlooking the Atlantic, was tethered to a precarious pile of driftwood by the crashing waves. The sea wind whipped Ellie's auburn hair into her face, blurring the already wavering edges of the canvas before her.

It was supposed to be a study in the quiet symphony of waves and seagulls, but the storm that had rolled in last night had tossed everything off its axis. Now, all Ellie saw were swirling sheets of grey where her blue sky should have been, and the image felt as fragmented and dissonant as the melody she so desperately sought to capture.
