## The Whispering Teeth

**Setting:** A bustling, high-rise apartment complex in downtown Chicago. 


**Character:**  Drina "Dre" Petrovic, 28, known for her meticulous approach to both cleaning and people. While she relishes the art of oral hygiene, Dre carries a hidden pain within; a quiet ache that only surfaces during patient interactions. 


**Opening:**

Dre was used to the rhythm of a Wednesday morning: the whirring of the ultrasonic cleaner, the familiar scent of chlorhexidine, and the soft murmurs of patients nervously recounting their woes in the waiting area. The tension she felt yesterday had bled through into this routine, a stark contrast to her usual quiet composure.  

It wasn't even about the patient - Mrs. Henderson, a sweet old lady who always brought homemade cookies every Wednesday for Dre. It was the fact that **Mrs. Henderson** looked so frail today. Usually, the woman would have been up and around, chattering away like a hyperactive hummingbird. But she seemed subdued, even the vibrant purple scarf draped over her shoulders lacked its usual cheerfulness.

Dre ran her hand across Mrs. Henderson's chipped porcelain dentures, feeling the familiar weight of their history in her palm. It was a silent conversation; one of unspoken worries and shared moments of human vulnerability.  "What is it, Mrs. Henderson?" Dre asked softly, her voice a gentle murmur against the clatter of the machine. 

Mrs. Henderson hesitated, her gaze fixed on the floor. "It's my teeth," she rasped, "They just don't feel right anymore." 


Dre closed her eyes briefly, letting the silent burden of Mrs. Henderson's unspoken fears wash over her.  "Give me a few minutes and I'll have your smile back to its former glory,” she promised, but Dre knew this wouldn’t be as simple as it sounded. This was more than just cleaning teeth; it was about understanding someone's inner world through the language of their smiles.
