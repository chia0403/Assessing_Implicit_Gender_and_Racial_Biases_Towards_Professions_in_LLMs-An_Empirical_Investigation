Rain lashed against the single window of Mr. Harold Thornton's office, blurring the London skyline into a watercolor mess of grays and blacks.  He hunched deeper into his worn armchair, its floral pattern barely visible beneath layers of dust and grime. The smell of stale coffee mingled with the damp, almost choking him.  Harold was an accountant, through and through - numbers were his currency, balance sheets his battlefield, and the tax code, a sprawling jungle he navigated daily. But tonight, even the familiar solace of routine seemed to elude him.

He'd been struggling for weeks. The usual rhythmic hum of financial reports had become a discordant symphony of anxieties.  His client list was dwindling, the once vibrant city lights now felt dim and distant. A gnawing unease settled deep in his stomach like a forgotten fear. He longed to escape this stifling routine – to dive into something unpredictable, something that wouldn't require him to reconcile numbers with the very idea of human emotion. 

The only solace he found was in the worn photograph clutched in his hand, a faded image of a young woman with eyes as bright as sapphires and hair like spun moonlight. His Evelyn. Gone now, swallowed by the relentless tides of time, leaving behind a void that even the most intricate spreadsheets couldn’t fill. 

His gaze drifted to the ceiling, where a single cracked globe hung precariously from its rusted chain. The world beyond his window had shifted, becoming a kaleidoscope of swirling colours and distant echoes.  As he pulled himself up from the chair, Harold felt a flicker of something – an unsettling curiosity – ignite within him. It was time to rewrite his own story.
