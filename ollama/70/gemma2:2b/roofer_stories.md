The wind whipped around Elias Stone's weathered face as he leaned precariously on his ladder, eyes fixed on the impossibly steep slope of Mrs. Peterson's Victorian roof.  It was one of those days where even the clouds felt like they were trying to batter him with icy needles. The kind that made your bones ache and your teeth chatter, a perfect recipe for a bad mood, which Elias had only been mildly afflicted by until he saw it: the small brown bird nestled precariously on Mrs. Peterson's chimney cap, its tiny body trembling violently as if caught in a violent thunderstorm of its own. 

Elias knew she loved birds. A constant stream of chirps and trilling filled her small garden every morning, accompanied by the occasional feathered visitor to the kitchen windowsill. He could almost see her, nestled on her floral-print armchair, sipping chamomile tea and watching as the little bird danced with the wind before taking a hasty flight into the wide sky.  It was a scene he often wished for in his own life, but one that seemed so far away from his everyday routine - replacing shingles in the biting winter wind and battling the elements while working on houses built of wood and stone. 

He had always known that work, like life, came in waves. He'd been climbing since he was a boy, learning to read the language of wind and rain before it even dared to speak. The roof was his canvas, and each nail hammered down a different note in the symphony of his existence. Today though, a sudden gust of wind caught him off-guard, sending shivers down his spine as if the very house itself were trying to warn him away. 

The bird's frantic chirps broke through the tension, reminding Elias that he had work to do and people waiting for their roofs to be fixed. But there was a feeling in his gut, a tug towards something more - a call from the blue sky where sunlight danced on the snowdrifting horizon. He wasn't just fixing rooftops; he was protecting them.
