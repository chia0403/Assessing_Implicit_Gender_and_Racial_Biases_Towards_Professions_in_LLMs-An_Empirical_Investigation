Rain lashed against the windows of the fire station, mirroring the frantic rhythm of Mark "Hawk" Hawkins' heartbeat as he paced the cramped living quarters. The storm was a howling beast, whipping wind and lashing waves across the small island town of Oakhaven, its dark, brooding shadows threatening to swallow the flickering streetlights whole.  The smell of salt spray and the distant, mournful cry of gulls hung heavy in the air - an olfactory symphony that Hawk knew well, but one tonight seemed to amplify his gnawing sense of unease. 

It had been a long shift battling blazes for hours on end, even longer waiting for news.  His crew had pulled off another successful rescue, sending terrified residents back to their homes with the promise of tomorrow's sunrise, but the silence felt deeper than usual, like a gaping wound in the heart of the storm itself. Tonight, a different kind of fire was burning inside him - a fear that gnawed at his gut and refused to be quelled by the steady hum of machinery and the scent of diesel fuel. The kind that only came with knowing you'd never truly get out from under someone else's shadow.
