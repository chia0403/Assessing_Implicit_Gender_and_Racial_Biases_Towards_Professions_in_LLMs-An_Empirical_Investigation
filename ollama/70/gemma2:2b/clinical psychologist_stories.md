Rain lashed against Dr. Eleanor Croft's office windows, each gust an echo of the storm raging within her own heart. The scent of rain-soaked earth and old books filled the room, a comforting familiarity in this otherwise sterile space. She looked at the woman across the desk, eyes brimming with unshed tears.  "Tell me again," she said, her voice soft yet firm. "What exactly led to tonight's...incident?" 

Eleanor had seen countless patients navigate their own mental labyrinths throughout her career as a clinical psychologist. This one, Mrs. Amelia Thornton, was unlike any other.

The storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within Mrs. Thornton’s soul.  Eleanor sat back, taking in the woman's raw vulnerability before her. It was as if the weight of a thousand unspoken secrets pressed down on her, threatening to engulf Amelia entirely. The air crackled with the impending emotional eruption, a silent battle between control and chaos.
