The aroma of burnt oil and gasoline hung thick in the air, clinging to the grime-stained apron around Felix "Mac" McNamara's waist like a second skin. He surveyed his workshop â€“ the dented red paint of the shed walls, faded tools glinting under the fluorescent lights, a mountain of spare parts threatening to engulf him. Outside, rain hammered against the roof, mimicking the relentless rhythm of his thoughts.  A rumble, low and throaty, emanated from beneath the cherry-red Ford pickup he'd been working on for weeks. 

Mac leaned closer, his brow furrowing as he listened to the engine's protest. "It's just got a little more oomph in it," he muttered under his breath, fiddling with the distributor cap. "Maybe a little more spark too."  He was known by his crew as the man who could coax life back into even the most stubbornly broken-down machine, and lately, that spirit had been faltering. His heart was weary from years of chasing ghosts in the engine bays of other people's dreams, and tonight, he wasn't sure if he could summon the magic again.
