It was 7:03 pm on a Wednesday, just after sunset painted the San Francisco skyline in shades of orange and gold, casting long shadows across her intimate massage therapy practice tucked away on Divisadero Street. The soft glow emanating from her antique lamp created a soothing ambience, almost like an oasis amidst the city's bustle.  Tonight, though, the tranquility was interrupted by the clatter of unfamiliar footsteps approaching her office door. 

Amy peered through the small window pane in her frosted-glass screen. A tall man with dark hair slicked back and piercing blue eyes stood hesitantly on the other side. His worn leather jacket didn't quite fit his lean frame, and he seemed tense, almost like a coiled spring waiting to release its energy.  He shifted his weight from one foot to the other, looking lost in the space between himself and Amy.  The air around him hummed with an unspoken tension that made Amyâ€™s heart beat faster.
