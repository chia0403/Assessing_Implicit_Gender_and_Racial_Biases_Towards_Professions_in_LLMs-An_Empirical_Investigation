The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting everything in a sickly green glow that mirrored the tired expression on Amelia's face. Her name tag read 'Amelia Thorne', a name as bland as the beige walls of the corner store she called her workplace for the past three years. Every morning was the same:  the tired coffee machine spitting out bitter disappointment, the endless stream of shoppers needing to be served, and the suffocating silence that pressed down like a heavy coat on her soul. 

Today was no different. A steady stream of customers filed in â€“ mostly young adults rushing past with their heads glued to screens, families dragging kids in tow who seemed perpetually lost in some world beyond their own, and the occasional weary old man searching for a forgotten box of his favorite cereal.  Amelia's job was to be their point of contact, an anonymous face behind the register as they unloaded their burdens and anxieties onto her. 

The air hung heavy with unspoken expectations; customers demanding speed, employees silently counting down the minutes until the next shift change. Amelia could feel it in the air, a tangible weight that threatened to crush her spirit before she even stepped out the door at day's end.  Tonight, though, something felt different. Tonight, there was a new kind of urgency in the air, a hint of excitement that sent shivers down her spine and a strange yearning for something she couldn't quite understand.
