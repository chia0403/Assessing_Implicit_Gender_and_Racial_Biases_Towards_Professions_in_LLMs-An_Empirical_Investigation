## Story Opening & Setting

**Setting:**  The sprawling Blackwood Manor Estate, nestled amongst rolling hills and ancient woodlands in the English countryside. The manor itself is a gothic masterpiece, its blackstone facade scarred by time and weather. A sense of melancholy pervades the air; remnants of faded grandeur cling to the crumbling turrets and cobweb-draped staircases. 

**Main Character:**  Arthur Thistlewick III, known simply as "Art" to those who knew him, was a man whose age belied his gentle nature. With hands calloused from years spent tending the manor's gardens, Art possessed a quiet strength and an uncanny understanding of the natural world that bordered on magical.

**Opening:**  The rain hammered against the glass skylights of the greenhouse like angry drumbeats.  Arthur Thistlewick III hunched over his workbench, meticulously sorting through a collection of miniature clay statues. Their faces, half-formed figures with vacant eyes, watched him from the ceramic-encrusted table; each one a silent testament to the fleeting nature of life. "They say there's beauty in decay," he muttered, tracing a fingertip along a cracked terracotta face.  "Perhaps that's why I find myself drawn to these forgotten memories."  He glanced up at the looming shadows cast by the storm, his eyes filled with a deep, unspoken sorrow. The manor was silent except for the rhythmic tapping of the rain against the glass, a sound that echoed the melancholy beating of his heart. 

**What happens next?** Will Arthur unravel the secrets buried within the manor's decaying walls? Or will the darkness consume him entirely?
