Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the shack, mimicking the frantic drumbeat of Elara’s heart.  The static crackled from her hand-built receiver, its signal an erratic dance in the storm's violent symphony. Outside, the world was swirling: wind howled like a banshee, trees swayed menacingly, and a chilling, guttural growl resonated deep within the earth. 

Elara adjusted the makeshift antenna, a tangled mess of copper wires and scavenged metal salvaged from the wreckage of a long-gone aircraft.  For years, she'd spent her days tinkering with radio frequencies, chasing whispers in the static, hoping to hear something beyond the chaos. Her name is Elara Blackwood, and her world was this ramshackle shed perched precariously on the edge of an abandoned mining town. A world that now seemed to hold a secret as ominous as the storm raging outside.

Her fingers trembled, their movements hesitant in the face of the unknown.  Was it just rain making a racket or was there something else, something beyond this tangible reality – something she desperately wanted to hear? Elara’s gaze fell on the receiver's display, flickering with an elusive signal. It pulsed like a heartbeat – a single word etched on the screen, its echo resonating through her chest. 

**"Help."**
