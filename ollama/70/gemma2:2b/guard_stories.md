The frigid air whipped across Corvan's face as he stood before the imposing gates of Aethelheim, the city-state that shimmered beneath a sky the color of bruised plums.  His breath fogged in the icy wind, leaving him shivering in his heavy cloak despite the layers within. He adjusted the leather strap of his guardâ€™s pouch, its familiar weight a comforting presence against the harshness of the north wind. Corvan was a veteran, a seasoned man with calloused hands and eyes as deep blue as winter storms that had witnessed countless seasons of peace and unrest in the sprawling city-state. His name was etched onto the leather of his wrist â€“ Corvan Blackwood â€“ a name whispered with respect and apprehension alike.

He'd sworn an oath to protect Aethelheim, but tonight, that promise felt heavier than usual. Tonight, as he stood before the massive steel gate guarded by twin stone behemoths, there was somethingâ€¦ off.  A palpable tension that prickled at Corvan's skin like needles on a winter night. The usual symphony of life within Aethelheim â€“ the clanging of metal against metal from blacksmiths, the rhythmic chant of street vendors selling wares beneath the shimmering city lights â€“ was replaced by an unsettling silence. 

His gaze swept over the gate, searching for any sign, anything that might unravel this sense of foreboding. A sudden crackle in the distance sent a shiver down his spine. It wasnâ€™t thunder; it couldn't be. Corvan's eyes scanned the horizon, finding no answers beyond an unsettling stillness that felt like a premonition of chaos brewing just beneath the surface of this normally vibrant city-state.
