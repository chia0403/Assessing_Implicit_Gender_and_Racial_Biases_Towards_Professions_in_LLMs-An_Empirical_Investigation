## The Smoke-Ringed Kitchen

**Setting:**  A ramshackle kitchen on the edge of a bustling seaside town. Salt wind whips against leaky windows as a storm gathers its teeth over the harbor. 

**Character:**  Esmé Abernathy, her name an echo of a bygone era she barely remembers. She’s worn and weathered, her hands calloused from years spent battling hot grease and cold steel in the same kitchen since she was just a girl. The air hangs thick with the scent of burnt onions and simmering fish stock, yet Esmé can't seem to catch a break these days.  

**Story Opening:** 
The rain hammered on the roof, each drop echoing the frantic drumming of Esmé’s heart as she surveyed her work. Another day, another mountain of orders piling up on the counter, threatening to engulf her like the relentless waves that crashed against the pier just beyond the grimy windows. Tonight's catch was a storm of its own - mackerel and herring so fresh they practically swam on their platter. Freshness was good, she thought grimly. But sometimes, even the best seafood didn’t appease the demands of hungry mouths, especially when the world felt like it was falling apart around her. 

Esmé picked up a battered knife, its handle worn smooth with countless uses. This kitchen had seen many storms, too many to count. Yet, tonight, there was an ache in her bones that went beyond the storm's fury. Tonight, she could almost taste defeat.
