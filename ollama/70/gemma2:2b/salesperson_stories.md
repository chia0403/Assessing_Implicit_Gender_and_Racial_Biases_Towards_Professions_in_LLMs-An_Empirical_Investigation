The humid air hung thick and heavy in the cramped Chicago apartment, clinging to Elara's skin as she sat at her rickety desk, sorting through a stack of invoices. It was 3 AM, and the city outside was just beginning to stir with its early morning pulse. The faint hum of street noise mixed with the clinking of coins from the old slot machines in the next apartment, a sound that served as both comfort and an unsettling reminder of her precarious life. Elara, a woman born into a lineage of saleswomen, knew the streets like the back of her hand. Her father's gruff advice – "You can sell ice to Eskimos" – echoed in her ears as she picked up another invoice. It was just another day in the city that never sleeps, and Elara, the daughter of legends, was ready to weave her own story within its fabric.
