The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, thick as the humid July morning itself. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window of "Frank's Fine Cuts," illuminating motes that danced in the stillness. The shop was quiet, save for the rhythmic whirring of Frank Bartholomew’s antique barber chair as he adjusted the leather headrest with a practiced hand. 

He sat perched on his stool, a worn copy of "The Strand Magazine" open on his lap, his eyes skimming the words absentmindedly. Frank wasn't expecting anyone until midday, when the usual crowd of dockworkers and businessmen would trickle in for their weekly trims.  But even with the silence, Frank felt a familiar hum of anticipation. Every day at "Frank's Fine Cuts" was a story waiting to be told. Each customer, a chapter. And today, he knew, promised something special. 


The bell above the door chimed softly, breaking the peaceful morning quiet and pulling Frank’s gaze from the page.
