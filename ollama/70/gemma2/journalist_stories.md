The humid air hung heavy in New Orleans like a shroud, clinging to Eloise Camille Dubois's skin as she navigated the bustling French Quarter. A symphony of jazz drifted from open doorways, vying for attention with the clatter of streetcars and the incessant hum of cicadas. The scent of beignets and chicory coffee mingled with the less pleasant aroma of damp earth and stale beer. Eloise, a seasoned journalist known for her tenacity and sharp wit, tugged at the collar of her linen shirt, wishing for a cool breeze.  

She stood before the iconic Cafe Du Monde, its wrought-iron tables overflowing with tourists and locals alike, their faces lit by the flickering glow of paper lanterns strung overhead. Eloise had come to this vibrant city seeking answers, drawn in by whispers of a conspiracy hidden beneath the city's glittering fa√ßade. Her target: a shadowy figure known only as 'Le Serpent', rumored to manipulate the very fabric of New Orleans from the shadows.


This was more than just another story for Eloise. This felt personal.
