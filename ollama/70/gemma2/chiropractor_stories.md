The air in Dr. Evelyn Thorne’s office was thick with the scent of lavender oil and nervous sweat. Sunlight slanted through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the still air. Outside, Chicago hummed with its usual chaotic symphony of car horns and distant sirens, a stark contrast to the quiet sanctuary within.  

Evelyn glanced at the patient sitting on the examination table. His name was Michael, a stockbroker whose shoulders hunched like a question mark over his tightly gripped briefcase. He had come in complaining of chronic neck pain, but Evelyn suspected the real issue lay deeper – buried beneath layers of stress and unyielding ambition.

Michael fidgeted, shifting uncomfortably.  He looked like a man on the verge of unraveling. The weight of his world seemed to press down on him, visible in the tightness of his jaw and the furrow etched between his brows. Evelyn knew that her job wasn't just about aligning spines; it was about finding balance, both physical and emotional. She hoped she could help Michael find his.
