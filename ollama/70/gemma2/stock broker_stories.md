The air in the trading floor was thick with tension, a miasma of sweat, ambition, and overpriced coffee. The cacophony of ringing phones and shouted orders was like a living beast, pulsing and roaring with each market tick.

His fingers danced across his keyboard, executing trades with the precision of a concert pianist. Alistair wasn't just any stockbroker; he was known as "The Oracle" for his uncanny ability to predict market movements, turning millions into fortunes for himself and his clients. But today, something felt different. The usual hum of confidence in his gut had been replaced by a gnawing unease.
