The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eliza Amelia Hawthorne’s worn denim overalls like a comforting hug. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of her shop, "A Stitch in Time," illuminating the chaos of fabric bolts, half-finished garments, and spools of thread that overflowed from their bins.  Eliza ran a calloused hand over the velvet bodice of a midnight blue dress, its seams still raw and waiting for her magic touch. The rhythmic whirring of her vintage sewing machine filled the quiet street outside, a familiar lullaby in the heart of Victorian London’s bustling East End. 


She glanced at the faded notice pinned to the window: "Eliza Hawthorne - Dressmaker extraordinaire. Wedding gowns, mourning attire, day dresses, and alterations. No request too grand or small." Eliza knew it wasn't much, but it was honest work, keeping her family afloat, piece by delicate piece. She sighed, her gaze settling on a stack of crumpled letters tucked away on her workbench. Orders were scarce lately, whispers in the neighbourhood spoke of economic hardship and dwindling fortunes. 

Eliza’s heart ached for her customers, their hopes woven into each dress she crafted. Today, though, hope felt like a fragile thread, easily snagged and broken. But Eliza knew that even in the darkest corners of London, a single spark could ignite a flame. And sometimes, all it took was a little magic to bring light back into the world.
