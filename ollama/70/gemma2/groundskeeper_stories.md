The dew clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick's beard like tiny, glistening diamonds.  He inhaled deeply, the crisp morning air carrying the scent of damp earth and blossoming lilac. Sunlight, pale and watery through the early haze, painted long shadows across the manicured lawns of St. Augustine’s Academy. Bartholomew loved these moments – the stillness before the day’s clamor began, the quiet hum of life in the sprawling gardens he tended with such meticulous care. The school, a grand Victorian structure of brick and slate, loomed behind him, its arched windows reflecting the nascent sun like a thousand sleepy eyes. 

Bartholomew adjusted his leather gardening gloves, feeling the familiar roughness against his calloused palms. A lifetime spent amongst these rose bushes, topiaries, and ancient oaks had etched those lines into his skin, each one a testament to his dedication to this haven of learning.  He surveyed his domain with a practiced eye, his gaze lingering on the freshly raked gravel path leading to the main building. It was a perfect day, he thought, for a school to bloom. Little did he know, it was about to become something far more extraordinary than that.
