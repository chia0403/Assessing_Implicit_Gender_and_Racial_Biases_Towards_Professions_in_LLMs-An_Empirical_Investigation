The scent of aging paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that always soothed Evelyn Beatrice Thorne.  She ran a gloved hand over the spine of a first edition Dickens, her touch feather-light despite its heft. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the floorboards of the Oakhaven Historical Library, illuminating dust motes dancing in the silence. Outside, the wind rustled the leaves of the ancient oaks that gave the library its name, their branches clawing at the slate roof like skeletal fingers.  Evelyn, a woman whose grey hair was pulled back in a neat bun and whose spectacles perched precariously on her nose, surveyed her domain with quiet satisfaction. The Oakhaven Historical Library was her sanctuary, a world of forgotten stories and whispered secrets, where she felt truly at home.

But even in this haven of peace, change was brewing.  A letter from the city council lay unopened on her desk, its ominous seal promising news that would disrupt the quiet rhythm of Evelyn's life. A chill, unrelated to the autumn wind, crept down her spine. Whatever awaited her within those sealed folds, it promised to be anything but ordinary.
