The air in Dr. Evelyn Reed's office was thick with the scent of lavender hand sanitizer and nervous sweat. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the anxious drumming of ten-year-old Leo's fingers on the worn leather chair opposite her. Outside, thunder grumbled like a disgruntled giant, further amplifying the sense of unease in the small room.

Dr. Reed, a woman whose silver hair was perpetually pulled back in a neat bun and whose warm brown eyes held an air of calm competence, leaned forward.  "Leo, tell me what's been happening at school." 


The setting is a small, cozy office within the walls of Willow Creek Elementary School, nestled in a quiet suburban neighborhood. Despite its cheerful yellow paint and the whimsical posters adorning the walls, the atmosphere feels heavy with unspoken anxieties on this stormy afternoon.
