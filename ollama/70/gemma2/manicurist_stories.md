The air in "Polished Perfection" was thick with the scent of acetone and jasmine. Sunlight streamed through the front window, illuminating dust motes dancing above rows of brightly colored nail polishes. Eleanor Beauregard, known affectionately to her clientele as Ellie, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. Her salon, nestled in a quiet corner of Brooklyn Heights, pulsed with a familiar rhythm: the gentle whirring of electric files, the click-clack of acrylic brushes, and the murmur of conversations punctuated by bursts of laughter. 

Ellie, a petite woman with fiery red hair pulled back in a loose bun and eyes that sparkled like amethyst, felt an almost palpable calm descend upon her. This was her sanctuary, a space she'd carefully cultivated over fifteen years, where anxieties melted away beneath the soothing hum of the dryers and women shared secrets as easily as they swapped nail polish shades. 

But today, a nervous energy crackled beneath the surface. A new client, a woman with eyes that held an unsettling emptiness, had just arrived. Ellie had sensed it instantly – the air around her seemed to chill, drawing Ellie's gaze like a moth to a flame.  The woman’s appointment was scheduled for a simple manicure, yet something about her presence felt…different.
