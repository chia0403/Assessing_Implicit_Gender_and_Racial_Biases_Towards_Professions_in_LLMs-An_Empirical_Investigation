The smell of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp scent of disinfectant that clung to everything in Ms. Amelia Brightwood's world.  It was 7:15 am and, as usual, chaos reigned in the brightly-colored playroom of "Tiny Tots," the daycare center where she worked. Toddlers shrieked their morning greetings, a chorus of off-key humming filled the air from the arts and crafts table, and the ever-present soundtrack of clanging plastic and thundering little feet vibrated through the floor. 

Amelia surveyed the scene with weary affection. It was always like this, a whirlwind of sticky fingers, spilled juice, and boundless energy. Despite the relentless demands, despite the occasional temper tantrum that left her feeling drained, Amelia wouldn't trade it for anything.  She had a heart overflowing with love for these tiny humans, each one a unique constellation of curiosity and chaos. 

Today, however, felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Ameliaâ€™s spine, like a premonition waiting to unfurl. As she bent down to pick up a rogue building block, her gaze fell upon a small, crumpled note lying beneath the bookshelf. It wasn't addressed to anyone in particular, just a single sentence scrawled on pink paper: "Don't trust the shadows." 


Amelia felt a chill crawl up her spine. Was it a childish prank? A forgotten message from an older child? Or something more sinister? She glanced around the room at the seemingly oblivious children playing amongst themselves, their laughter ringing like innocent chimes.  

The note remained clutched in her hand, a silent warning hanging heavy in the air.
