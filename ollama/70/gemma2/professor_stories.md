The air in Professor Eleanor Blackwood’s office hung thick with the scent of old parchment and pipe tobacco – remnants of her predecessor's fondness for both. Eleanor herself inhaled deeply, trying to banish the lingering ghost of that other presence. This was her office now, her domain within the ancient halls of St. Symeon's University. The setting sun cast long shadows across the worn oak desk cluttered with stacks of dusty tomes and half-finished research papers. A single flickering candle on the desk illuminated a map spread out before her – a meticulously detailed cartography of a realm whispered about in hushed tones, a place known as Eldoria.  It was a land shrouded in myth, said to be hidden behind a veil, accessible only through ancient rituals and forgotten paths. Eleanor ran a finger along a winding river marked "The River Whisper," its course leading to an uncharted region labelled simply "The Shadowwood." Her heart thrummed with a mixture of trepidation and exhilaration. Tonight, she would begin her journey into Eldoria.
