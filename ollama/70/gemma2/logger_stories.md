The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  Sunlight filtered through the towering firs, casting dancing shadows on the forest floor where Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood swung his axe with practiced ease. Each swing echoed through the silent woods, a metronome marking the rhythm of his life. The rhythmic thud of wood meeting steel was the soundtrack to his existence, a symphony of solitude conducted in the emerald embrace of the Pacific Northwest. 

Bartâ€™s calloused hands gripped the axe handle like an old friend, their familiar weight comforting against the backdrop of the vast, ancient forest that stretched before him. He'd been logging these woods since he was a boy, learning the secrets of the trees from his father and grandfather before him.  The legacy of Blackwood loggers, etched in the rings of each felled giant, ran deep within him. But lately, something had shifted in the air, a tension as thick as the morning mist that clung to the towering pines. The whispers on the wind spoke of change, of men with suits and promises, who sought to claim what Bart considered his birthright: the forest.
