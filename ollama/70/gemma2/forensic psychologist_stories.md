The stale air hung heavy in Dr. Evelyn Albright’s office, thick with the scent of burnt coffee and nervous energy. The single fluorescent bulb above her desk cast a sickly yellow light over the worn leather armchair facing her. Outside, rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the tempest brewing within Evelyn herself. 

She stared at the file on her desk, its cover starkly labelled: "Subject - Johnathan Thorne."  Johnathan Thorne. The name sent a shiver down her spine. He was a notorious serial killer, dubbed "The Weaver" by the press for his meticulous, almost artistic, method of disposing of his victims. Now, after years in solitary confinement, he had finally agreed to speak with her.

Evelyn, renowned for her ability to delve into the darkest corners of the human psyche, was tasked with evaluating Thorne's mental state and determining if he was fit to stand trial again. This case wasn’t just a job; it was a personal challenge, a labyrinth she felt compelled to unravel. A chance to confront the darkness that lurked within her own mind, mirrored in the eyes of a monster.  

The rain pounded harder, the sound an insistent drumbeat against the silence. Evelyn inhaled deeply, steeling herself for what lay ahead. It was time to enter Thorne’s world, a place where sanity and madness danced a macabre waltz.
