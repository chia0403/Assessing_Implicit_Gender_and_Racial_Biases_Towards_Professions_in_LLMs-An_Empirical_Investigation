The wind howled through the jagged peaks of the Cinderstone Mountains, whipping snow into frenzied dances around Seraphina Thorne's boots. She pulled her woolen cloak tighter, its crimson lining a splash of warmth against the biting chill. The moon, a sliver of silver against the charcoal sky, cast long, skeletal shadows from the ancient pines that clung precariously to the mountainside. 

Seraphina tightened her grip on the hilt of her sword, its polished steel reflecting the faint moonlight. She was alone, perched at the edge of Raven's Roost – a treacherous cliff face overlooking the desolate Valley of Echoes. Her post, as a guard of the Watchtower, demanded vigilance against any threat from the encroaching darkness that lingered beyond the mountain pass. Tonight, however, felt different. A disquiet gnawed at her, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that warned of unseen danger lurking in the swirling snow. 


Her gaze swept across the valley, searching for any flicker of movement, any anomaly in the desolate landscape. The silence was absolute, broken only by the mournful sigh of the wind and the crunch of her boots on the frozen ground. Seraphina knew this silence could be as deceptive as a predator’s stillness before the pounce.  Her heart hammered against her ribs, a drumbeat echoing the growing unease in her soul. This night, she sensed, would not be like any other.
