The air in Elias Thorne's workshop hung thick with the scent of lavender and freshly cut wool.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating swirling motes of dust and catching the vibrant threads that crisscrossed his workbench like miniature rainbows. Outside, the cobblestones of Edinburgh buzzed with the midday clamour – hawkers calling their wares, horses clip-clopping along the uneven streets, a distant piper lamenting some lost love. But inside Thorne's workshop, time seemed to flow differently. It was a sanctuary of quiet concentration, where the rhythmic click of needles and the rustle of silk were the only sounds that broke the silence. Elias himself was hunched over his latest project – a scarlet doublet for Lord MacTavish, its intricate brocade demanding meticulous care and attention.  The tailor's brow furrowed in concentration as he adjusted the needle with practiced ease, his nimble fingers working wonders with thread and fabric. 


Elias Thorne wasn't just any tailor. He was known throughout Edinburgh for his unmatched skill, his uncanny ability to capture not just the form but the very essence of a person in his creations.  His garments weren't mere clothes; they were reflections of the soul, whispers of history woven into every stitch. But today, even Elias Thorne couldn't shake a growing unease. A chill had settled over the city, unseen yet palpable – a sense that something was brewing beneath the surface of its familiar bustle.
