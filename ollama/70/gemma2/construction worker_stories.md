The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Vance's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat slicked his brow, stinging his eyes as he surveyed the half-built skyscraper jutting defiantly against the cloudless Miami sky.  

The air hummed with the constant symphony of construction: pneumatic drills gnawing at concrete, metal clangors echoing from the scaffolding, and the guttural roar of a forklift shifting prefabricated beams. Eli adjusted his hard hat, its brim casting a meager shadow over his squinting eyes. This was his world: steel skeletons rising towards the heavens, a testament to human ambition and Eli's calloused hands that helped shape them. 


But today felt different. There was an unsettling stillness amidst the usual cacophony, a pregnant silence that hung heavy in the air. The foreman, a man named Sal with eyes as cold as steel rebar, hadnâ€™t issued his morning spiel about safety protocols and productivity quotas. He just stood on the ground floor, phone pressed to his ear, his face an unreadable mask. 

Eli chewed on a wad of tobacco, trying to decipher the tension that had settled over the site like a dust cloud. Something was brewing, he could feel it in his bones. This wasn't just another construction day. It was the calm before the storm.
