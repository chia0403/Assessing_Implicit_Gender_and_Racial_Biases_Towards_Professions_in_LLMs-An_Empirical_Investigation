The morning air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and stale coffee as Elara Juniper adjusted her blue scrubs. Another day in the fluorescent-lit purgatory that was Smile Bright Dental.  She surveyed the room: the usual mishmash of outdated furniture, faded motivational posters, and patients fidgeting nervously in their chairs, their anxieties palpable like the lingering smell of peppermint toothpaste. Elara sighed, a wave of fatigue washing over her. This wasn't how she envisioned her life at twenty-five. She dreamt of travelling, exploring ancient ruins, maybe even learning to speak fluent Italian.  Instead, she was scraping plaque from the teeth of people who were more interested in their phones than their oral hygiene.


But today was different. Today, a new patient had walked through the door - a tall man with eyes that seemed to hold secrets and a smile that could melt glaciers. He smelled faintly of rain and sandalwood, a stark contrast to the sterile environment surrounding them. 

This, Elara thought, might just be interesting.
