The cockpit hummed with a low thrum, a comforting vibration against Amelia Grace Sterling’s spine. Outside, the twilight sky bled into a bruised purple, canvassed with streaks of fiery orange from the setting sun. The vast expanse of the Pacific stretched before her, its surface a rippling mirror reflecting the dying embers of day. She adjusted the flight controls, the familiar heft reassuring in her calloused hands. 

Amelia was alone, as she always was. This wasn't by choice. After the accident – the one they never spoke about – Amelia found solace in the solitude of the sky. Up here, amongst the clouds and stars, there were no whispers, no pitying glances, just the wind singing through the wings and the endless blue horizon whispering promises of escape.

Amelia squared her shoulders, took a deep breath, and pushed the throttle forward. The engine roared to life, a primal cry against the encroaching darkness. It was time.
