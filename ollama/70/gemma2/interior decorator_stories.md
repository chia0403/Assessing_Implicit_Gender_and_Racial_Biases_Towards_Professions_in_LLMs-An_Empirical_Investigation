The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of fresh paint. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of the Victorian townhouse, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness. Amelia Thistlewood surveyed her canvas - a chaotic jumble of ripped velvet drapes, discarded swatches of floral wallpaper, and furniture draped like weary ghosts in white sheets. It was a scene only an interior decorator could find beautiful; a symphony of potential waiting to be orchestrated. 

Amelia ran a gloved hand over the chipped marble fireplace surround. This grand old house, perched precariously on the edge of a forgotten neighborhood, held stories within its crumbling walls. Stories she intended to bring back to life with bold colors, eclectic textures, and an infusion of modern elegance.  This wasn't just another project for Amelia Thistlewood; it was a rescue mission, a testament to her belief that every home deserved a second chance at glory.
