The rusty whine of a hammer against tin echoed across the dusty expanse of the city rooftop.  Sweat beaded on Elias Bartholomew’s brow, clinging to the scraggly hairs that escaped his faded bandana. Below him, the cityscape sprawled like a concrete jungle, its cacophony muffled by the thin membrane of asphalt and brick. The air hung heavy with the smell of exhaust fumes and simmering tar.

Elias, perched precariously on a sloping roofline in the forgotten district of Southwark, adjusted his safety harness for the tenth time that morning. He was a master of his craft – roofing being more art than trade to him - but today felt different. A prickling unease danced along his spine, a feeling amplified by the unnerving stillness of the city. There wasn't even the usual drone of traffic on the street below. 

He squinted at the hazy horizon, searching for a familiar landmark. The monolithic clock tower that marked the edge of Southwark was shrouded in an unusual mist, its usually imposing silhouette lost in the haze. Elias swallowed, feeling a knot tighten in his stomach. Something wasn't right.   


The sun dipped behind the buildings, casting long, distorted shadows across the city.  Elias finished his task, sealing the last loose shingle with practiced ease. He checked his toolbox – hammer, nails, spare tar paper – everything was accounted for. But as he turned to descend, a sudden gust of wind whipped through the narrow alleys below, sending a shiver down his spine.
