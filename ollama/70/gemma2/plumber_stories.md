The humid Georgia air clung to  Elias "Eli" Vance like a damp towel as he navigated the narrow alley behind Mama Rosa's Pizzeria. The aroma of baking dough and marinara sauce battled with the pungent odor of week-old garbage. Eli grimaced, wiping his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smear of grease across his forehead. His overalls, already stained with the day's work, absorbed every drop of sweat that trickled down his back. 

He reached the source of the call - a small, brick building barely visible behind overflowing dumpsters. A flickering neon sign above the door buzzed erratically, proclaiming "Tony's Treasures: Antique & Curio Shop" in faded green letters.  Eli sighed. This wasn’t exactly the glamorous plumbing job he’d dreamt of as a kid. 


He straightened his cap, adjusted the strap on his tool belt, and pushed open the creaking door. Inside, dust motes danced in the dim light filtering through grimy windows. A cacophony of clanking metal and whispering echoes greeted him, making the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end. This place was giving off serious "haunted antique shop" vibes. 


Eli cleared his throat. “Mr. Tony?” he called out.  Silence. The only response was a single, mournful cough from somewhere deep within the shop. Eli stepped further inside, his boots crunching on broken glass and stray ceramic shards. This was going to be interesting.
