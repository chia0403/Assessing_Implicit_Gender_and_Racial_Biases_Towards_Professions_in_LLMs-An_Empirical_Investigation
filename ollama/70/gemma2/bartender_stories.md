The neon "Open" sign buzzed with a tired hum, casting a sickly yellow glow across the rain-slicked pavement outside The Rusty Mug. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and regret. At the bar, Silas Alistair Finch meticulously polished a pint glass, his movements methodical and practiced like an old ritual. 

Silas was no stranger to regret. He'd seen it manifest in countless faces that had slumped onto The Rusty Mug's worn stools over the years -  broken hearts, lost dreams, and lives spiraling down paths they hadn't intended. Each story, etched into their weary expressions, another layer of wisdom added to Silas' own already vast collection. He knew how to listen, how to offer a comforting silence or a well-timed quip, all while keeping the bar stocked and the patrons content. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A low hum vibrated in the air, unsettling even the usual cacophony of rain and clinking glasses. Silas glanced at the clock - 11:57 pm.  Just two more minutes until midnight. And then... something was going to happen. He could feel it in his bones.


The Rusty Mug, a dimly lit dive bar tucked away on a forgotten corner of the city, wasn't known for its glamorous clientele or extravagant events. But tonight, something extraordinary was about to unfold.
