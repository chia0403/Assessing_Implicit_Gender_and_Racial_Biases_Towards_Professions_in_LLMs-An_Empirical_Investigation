The humid Georgia air hung thick as molasses, clinging to  Jasper Thaddeus "Jazz" Blackwood like a second skin. Beads of sweat traced paths through the dust on his forehead as he crouched beneath the flickering fluorescent lights of the dusty antique shop. The smell of mothballs and forgotten dreams filled his nostrils, a familiar aroma in this town where time seemed to move slower than molasses itself. Jazz ran a hand over the tangled mess of wires snaking out from the wall, muttering curses under his breath. This wasn't just another blown fuse – it was an electrical labyrinth built by someone who clearly didn't understand Ohm's Law or basic safety regulations. 

The owner, a woman with a face as wrinkled and worn as the antique furniture she sold, peered at him from behind a towering stack of porcelain dolls. "That there wiring's older than me," she rasped, her voice like dry leaves rustling in the wind. "If it ain't broke, don't fix it, that's what my daddy always said." 

Jazz sighed, knowing this was a situation where fixing it was less of a choice and more of a necessity.  He had a reputation in town – reliable, honest, and capable of coaxing life back into even the most archaic electrical systems.  


This antique shop, however, promised to be a particular challenge.
