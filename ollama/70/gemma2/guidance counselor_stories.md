The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Rosalind Finch's head like a chorus of anxious bees, their buzzing mirroring the chaotic thoughts swirling in her own mind. Her office, typically a sanctuary of soft cardigans and calming aromatherapy diffusers, felt suffocatingly small. The worn beige carpet seemed to absorb the silence between each frantic thump of her heart. 

Eleanor was a guidance counselor at Northgate High, a sprawling brick edifice nestled in the heart of suburban malaise. It was the kind of place where dreams went to die, replaced by standardized tests and college applications that felt more like prison sentences. Today, however, things were different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than usual even for a Friday afternoon on the precipice of summer break.  Something was about to happen, Eleanor could feel it in her bones, something that would shake the very foundations of Northgate High and change everything for everyone.
