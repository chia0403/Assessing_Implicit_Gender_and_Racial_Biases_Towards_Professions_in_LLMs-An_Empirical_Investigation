The smoky air hung heavy in The Blue Moon Saloon, thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap perfume, and unfulfilled dreams.  Moonlight sliced through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air as Esmeralda "Esme" Nightingale adjusted the microphone stand, her voice a quiet murmur against the din of the crowd. 

Her fingers traced the worn leather of her guitar case, a familiar comfort in this chaotic space. The Blue Moon was where she’d come every Friday night for the past year, honing her craft, hoping to catch the ear of someone – anyone – who could help her break free from this town and onto a bigger stage. Tonight felt different though. A subtle buzz crackled in the air, a collective anticipation that thrummed beneath the surface chatter.  Esme couldn't shake the feeling that tonight was her night.
