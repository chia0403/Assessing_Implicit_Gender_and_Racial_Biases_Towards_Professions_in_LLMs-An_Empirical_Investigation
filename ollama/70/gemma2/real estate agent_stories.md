The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Amy" Bellweather like a second skin as she navigated the cobblestone streets of Savannah's historic district. Spanish moss draped from ancient oaks, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering light of gas lamps lining the path. The scent of jasmine and salt air hung heavy in the twilight, a symphony of smells unique to this Southern jewel. 

Amy adjusted the strap of her satchel, its weight a familiar comfort against her hip. Inside lay the tools of her trade: contracts, brochures, a notepad scribbled with potential client details, and a tiny antique key she kept as a lucky charm. She was about to meet Mr. Bartholomew Hawthorne, a notoriously difficult man who owned one of Savannah's most prized Victorian mansions, rumored to be haunted by the ghost of its original owner. 


Mr. Hawthorne wanted to sell, but Amy knew he wouldn't be easy to convince. This wasn't just another house sale; it was a chance to prove herself in the competitive Savannah real estate market and secure her place among the city's elite agents. She squared her shoulders, took a deep breath of that heady Southern air, and prepared to face Mr. Hawthorne.
