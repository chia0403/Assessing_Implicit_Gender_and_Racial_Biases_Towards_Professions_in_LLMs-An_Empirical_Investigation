The hum of the antique clock on Mr. Hemmingsworth’s desk was the only sound breaking the sterile silence of his office.  It ticked with an almost accusatory rhythm, each click another hammer blow against Penelope Evelyn Bell's dwindling hope for a productive morning. Outside, London was already stirring, but within these mahogany-paneled walls, time seemed to have stalled.

Penelope, perched on her swivel chair like a vigilant sparrow, tapped impatiently at her typewriter. Mr. Hemmingsworth, her employer, had been in a rare fit of inspiration last night and bombarded Penelope with a mountain of urgent correspondence demanding immediate attention. She’d already typed out half a dozen letters filled with flowery prose about "unparalleled innovation" and "groundbreaking advancements," all penned for the new line of hair tonic that Mr. Hemmingsworth insisted would revolutionize the industry (despite the fact that it smelled suspiciously like lavender hand soap). 

The morning sun, filtering through the dusty blinds, painted stripes across the worn carpet. Penelope shifted in her seat, her gaze drifting to the framed portrait of Mr. Hemmingsworth that hung above the fireplace. It depicted him in his younger days, sporting a handlebar moustache and an air of confident self-assurance. Now, at seventy years old, he possessed a perpetual air of grumpy bewilderment, his eyes perpetually searching for some unseen source of frustration.  


"Perhaps," Penelope thought, "the tonic really does work.”
