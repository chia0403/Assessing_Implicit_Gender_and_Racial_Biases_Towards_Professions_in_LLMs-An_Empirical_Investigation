The air hung thick with the scent of iron and brine in Reginald "Reg" Blackwood's shop. Dawn hadn't yet pierced the grimy windows, but Reg was already elbow-deep in a side of beef, his hands calloused and sure as he cleaved through muscle and fat. The rhythmic thud of his cleaver against the steel block was the only sound besides the distant rumble of London waking up. 

Outside, the cobblestone streets of Whitechapel were shrouded in mist, the gas lamps struggling to fight back the encroaching darkness. Inside, Reg's shop, Blackwood's Fine Meats, was a haven of warmth and light, the flames in the hearth crackling merrily. Rows upon rows of hanging carcasses bathed in the warm glow, their blood-drained flesh gleaming like polished mahogany. 

Reg hummed a tuneless melody as he worked, his brow furrowed in concentration. He wasn't just any butcher; Reg was known for his craftsmanship, his cuts precise, his meats tenderized to perfection.  But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced across his skin, an unease that seemed to stem from the very marrow of the beef he held. It was a feeling he couldn't shake off, a sense that something – or someone – was watching him.
