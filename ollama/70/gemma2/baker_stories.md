The scent of caramelized sugar hung thick in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly ground nutmeg. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of "Honeycomb & Hearth," bathing the quaint bakery in a warm glow.  

Inside, Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick, her brow furrowed in concentration, kneaded dough with practiced hands. Flour dusted her apron like fresh snow, and a stray strand of fiery red hair escaped its braid to tickle her freckled nose.
