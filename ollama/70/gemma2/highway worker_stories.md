The asphalt beneath Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Jones's steel-toed boots was already shimmering with the heat of the Arizona sun, even before 7:00 AM. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling faintly of diesel and dust devils. Ellie squinted at the horizon where the desert met the sky, a hazy line indistinguishable until the first sliver of sunlight bled over it, turning the whole world into a shimmering mirage. Her toolbox sat beside her on the cracked asphalt, its contents familiar: wrench, hammer, screwdrivers, duct tape â€“ the tools of her trade, keeping the arteries of Arizona flowing.  She was responsible for this stretch of Highway 180, a ribbon that snaked through the heart of the state, connecting dusty towns and bustling cities. Today, it meant fixing a pothole the size of a small car, one that could swallow a tire whole and send a driver spinning into the unforgiving desert.  Ellie was a master of her domain, as comfortable with asphalt as a fish was in water. But today, there was something different in the air, a prickle on the back of her neck that told her this wasn't just another day mending broken roads.
