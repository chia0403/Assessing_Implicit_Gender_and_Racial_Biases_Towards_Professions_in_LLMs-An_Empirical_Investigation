The fluorescent lights hummed above Beatrice Juniper’s head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the rows of file cabinets that lined the walls of her office. Papers spilled from every surface: invoices, receipts, W-2s forming colorful, chaotic piles. Outside, the March wind whipped through the skeletal branches of the oak trees lining Main Street in Harmony Creek, Iowa, bringing with it the scent of thawing earth and a hint of approaching spring. But inside Beatrice’s “Accounts & Apples” office, winter lingered, its chill compounded by the anxiety that filled the air. 

Beatrice herself, a woman whose auburn hair was perpetually escaping her bun, fought to maintain composure as she reviewed Mr. Henderson's tax forms for the tenth time. His deductions seemed off, his claimed dependents a bit suspicious.  He insisted he was “just trying to save some money,” but Beatrice’s years of experience told her there was more to this story than met the eye. 


Harmony Creek wasn’t exactly known for its high-stakes financial crimes, but Beatrice had learned long ago that even in small towns, people could surprise you.
