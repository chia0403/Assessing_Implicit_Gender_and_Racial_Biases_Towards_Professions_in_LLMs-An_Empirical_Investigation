The bell above the door tinkled its melancholic tune as Amelia Everly adjusted her lavender-scented hand lotion, the scent barely masking the sterile odor clinging to the room.  She hated this part - the awkward silence after the client left, the echo of their fading anxieties hanging heavy in the air. 

Her little massage therapy studio, "Serenity Now," was tucked away on a side street in Elmwood, a neighborhood where ambition and neglect battled for dominance. Brick facades crumbled alongside meticulously tended gardens, and the aroma of fresh-baked bread often mingled with the exhaust fumes of passing cars. Amelia loved its contradictions, the way it mirrored her own life - striving for peace amidst the constant chaos.  

Today's client had been Mr. Henderson, a stoic man with hands that bore witness to years of toil. He’d left after his deep tissue massage, shoulders visibly relaxed, with only a curt "Thank you" and a faint hint of a smile. Now, Amelia stood alone, her fingers still tingling from the pressure points she'd worked on. The quiet hum of the fluorescent light overhead was the only sound besides her own heartbeat, a steady drum against the backdrop of Elmwood’s muted symphony.  


Amelia took a deep breath, trying to center herself. It wouldn't be long before the next client arrived, bringing with them their stories and anxieties. She was ready.
