The morning mist clung to the sprawling grounds of Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary like a ghost, muffling the usual chorus of barks, meows, and clucks.  A lone rooster crowed from its perch in the coop, sounding mournful rather than celebratory. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, her red hair pulled back in a messy braid, sighed as she surveyed the scene from the porch of the caretaker's cottage. 

The sanctuary was usually buzzing with activity by this hour. Volunteers would be arriving, eager to muck stalls and feed the animals under Amelia's watchful eye. But today felt different. An oppressive silence hung in the air, broken only by the rustle of leaves and the distant thud of hooves on gravel.  A chill snaked down Amelia's spine, sending a shiver through her woolen cardigan. Something wasn't right.


The sanctuary was nestled amidst towering pines in rural Maine, its rambling fences housing everything from rescued farm animals to exotic birds. It had been Amelia's sanctuary for as long as she could remember, a place where wounded souls – both animal and human – found solace.  But today, the peace that usually permeated Whispering Pines felt fragile, threatened by an unseen force.
