The fluorescent hum of the 'Bargain Bin Bazaar' buzzed in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's ears like a discontented hive. She tapped her finger against the chipped plastic counter, its surface slick with sticky residue from countless sugary drinks and melting ice cream cones. The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stale air. Outside, the August heat pressed down on the ramshackle strip mall like a heavy blanket, making the air thick and humid. Inside, Amelia longed for the cool rush of the walk-in freezer, but duty called. A bell tinkled as the door swung open, announcing another customer into the dim sanctuary of the Bargain Bin Bazaar. 


Amelia forced a smile, her gaze settling on a young woman pushing a cart overflowing with discounted snacks and faded, mismatched clothing.  "Welcome to the Bazaar," Amelia chirped, her voice betraying none of the weariness that clung to her like the scent of stale popcorn. "How can I help you?"
