The late afternoon sun slanted through the windows of The Willow Tree Rehabilitation Centre, casting long shadows across the cluttered waiting room.  Rosemary "Rosie" Larkspur adjusted her glasses, pushing them up the bridge of her nose as she glanced at the clock for the tenth time in five minutes. 3:58 pm. Where was Amelia? Rosie had been looking forward to this session all week.

Amelia wasn't a typical patient; she was a vibrant, spirited eight-year-old girl who loved nothing more than dancing and swinging on her monkey bars.  But after a nasty fall from her bike last month, Amelia found herself struggling with mobility and confidence.  Rosie had been working tirelessly with Amelia, trying to rebuild her strength and help her reclaim her joy in movement.

The Willow Tree itself was an old Victorian house, nestled on a leafy street lined with towering elm trees. The air hummed with the gentle chatter of recovering patients and the reassuring murmur of Rosie's colleague, Dr. Davies, who tended to his patients in the next room. Despite the building's age,  it exuded a warmth and sense of hope that calmed even the most anxious visitor. 


Rosie sighed, her gaze returning to the worn-out teddy bear sitting forlornly on the arm of the velvet armchair. It belonged to Amelia, and Rosie hoped that its familiar presence would help ease her young patient's anxieties.  Perhaps she could use this session to introduce a new game, something playful and engaging that would remind Amelia of the sheer joy in moving her body.
