The stale scent of disinfectant clung to Archibald Bartholomew "Archie" Finklebottom like a second skin. It was an aroma he knew intimately, a familiar companion on his solitary nightly rounds through the grand halls of the Blackwood Manor Museum.  

Blackwood Manor itself was a brooding Victorian mansion perched precariously atop a windswept cliff overlooking the churning grey sea. Built in the late 1800s by a wealthy shipping magnate, it now housed a collection of antique furniture, faded tapestries, and forgotten relics â€“ each whispering tales of grandeur past.  

Archie shuffled down the echoing hallway, his worn slippers making soft thuds against the polished floorboards. Moonlight filtered through the dusty stained-glass windows, casting long shadows that danced with his every movement. He hummed a mournful tune under his breath, a melody as old and melancholic as the manor itself. Tonight, like every night, he felt a strange connection to the building, its secrets whispering to him in the stillness.
