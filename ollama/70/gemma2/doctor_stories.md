The flickering neon sign outside cast an anemic pink glow across Dr. Amelia Beaumont’s tired face.  Rain lashed against the windows of her small practice, blurring the streetlights into hazy halos. It was 2:37 am, long past closing time, and Amelia was alone in the dimly lit office, surrounded by half-empty coffee cups and the faint scent of disinfectant. The rhythmic hum of the ancient air conditioner provided a melancholy soundtrack to her solitary vigil.

She was always working, pouring herself into her patients in this forgotten corner of New Orleans. It wasn’t glamorous; it wasn’t well-compensated. But it was hers.

She reached for her stethoscope, its worn leather cool against her palm, ready to face whatever came through that door next.
