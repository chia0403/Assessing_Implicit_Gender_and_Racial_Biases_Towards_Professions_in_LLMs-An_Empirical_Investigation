The sun beat down on Elian Thorne's back, the heat radiating from the rough granite beneath his calloused hands. Dust motes danced in the shafts of light piercing the shadowed interior of the quarry. The air hung heavy with the scent of sweat, sandstone, and something else – a metallic tang that lingered like a memory. 

Elian wasn't just any stone cutter. He was known throughout the region as "The Whisperer," a moniker earned through his uncanny ability to coax intricate designs from even the most stubborn rock. But lately, the whispers surrounding him had taken on a darker tone. There were rumors of ancient curses and forgotten rituals woven into the very fabric of the quarry he called home.

He dismissed them, of course. Superstitions whispered by men who feared what they couldn't understand. Yet, as he worked that day, a strange unease settled upon him. The hammer felt heavier in his hand, the chisel slipped more than usual, and every crack and fissure seemed to pulse with an unseen energy.

He was nearing the heart of the quarry, preparing to carve a new monument for Lord Ashford's growing collection, when he noticed it – a glint of obsidian deep within the stone. It wasn't natural. It felt…wrong. He pried at it with his chisel, unearthing a shard that pulsed with an ominous light.


As Elian held the obsidian in his hand, a tremor shook the earth, and the whispers in his head grew louder, darker. The quarry was no longer just a source of livelihood; it was a gateway to something ancient and malevolent. And he, the Whisperer, had unwittingly opened the door.
