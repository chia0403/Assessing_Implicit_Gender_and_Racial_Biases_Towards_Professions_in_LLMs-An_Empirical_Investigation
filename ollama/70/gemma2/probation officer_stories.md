The stale smell of cheap coffee clung to Elias Vance's trench coat like a second skin. He sat hunched in his beat-up Ford Taurus, its engine humming a tired lullaby, parked across the street from Mrs. Fitzwilliam's bakery. The aroma of fresh bread and sugar wafted through the cracked window, a cruel reminder of the life Vance had chosen – one spent navigating the underbelly of society instead of indulging in its sweeter comforts. 

Elias Vance, Senior Probation Officer for District 3, was not a man easily swayed by temptation. He’d seen enough shattered lives, enough broken dreams, to know that sweetness rarely lasted.  He was here on a visit with Michael Thorne, a young man under his supervision, charged with petty theft and reckless endangerment. Today's meeting: a routine check-in at the bakery where Michael worked, supposedly rehabilitating himself through honest labor.

But Vance knew better than to trust appearances. There were shadows lurking beneath the surface of every smile, a darkness waiting to be unleashed. And he had a feeling this visit was going to be anything but ordinary.  


The sun was just beginning to dip below the horizon, casting long shadows across the quaint cobblestone streets of Maplewood.  A chill settled in the air, bringing with it the promise of an autumn storm. Vance stepped out of his car, the engine’s hum fading into silence. His breath plumed white in the cool air as he adjusted his collar and walked towards the bakery, a knot of apprehension tightening in his gut.
