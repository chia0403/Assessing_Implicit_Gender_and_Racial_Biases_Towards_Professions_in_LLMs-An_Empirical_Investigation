The aroma of stale coffee and nervous anticipation hung thick in the air as Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the classroom. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stagnant air, each one a tiny spotlight on the faces staring back at her. Thirty-five pairs of eyes, young and weary, some filled with boredom, others with trepidation, all waiting for her to begin.

Amelia, known affectionately as Ms. Hawthorne by her students, took a deep breath and clutched the worn copy of "Hamlet" in her hand, its yellowed pages whispering tales of revenge and madness. This was her kingdom, this classroom nestled on the top floor of Elmwood High School, a sprawling brick building that seemed to sag under the weight of forgotten dreams and teenage angst. Here, amongst the chipped paint and creaky floorboards, Amelia sought to ignite something within these young minds, a spark of curiosity, a thirst for knowledge, perhaps even a flicker of Shakespearean passion. 


But today,  a palpable tension filled the air, a storm brewing beneath the surface of their teenage apathy. A feeling that something was different, something was about to change, hung heavy in the silence. Amelia, however, remained undeterred.  She raised her voice, its familiar cadence breaking the stillness. "Good morning, class," she began, her smile faltering slightly as she met those unsettling gazes. "Today, we begin Act Three."
