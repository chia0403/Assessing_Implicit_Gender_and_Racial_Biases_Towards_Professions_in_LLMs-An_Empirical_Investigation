The rhythmic whir of the blender filled Amelia Everly’s small kitchen, punctuated by the occasional clink of ice against glass. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting warm stripes across the counter where Amelia prepped her latest concoction: a vibrant green smoothie designed to boost energy and focus. Outside, the bustling streets of Seattle hummed with life - taxis honking, coffee shops spilling out patrons, the distant rumble of the ferry dock. But inside Amelia’s little haven, time seemed to slow. This was her sanctuary, where she could whip up nutritious meals, offer advice on healthy eating habits, and help people find balance in a world that often felt tilted precariously off-center.  Today, though, even Amelia’s carefully curated calm felt strained. 


The doorbell chimed, breaking the peaceful rhythm, and Amelia knew her quiet morning was over.  A new client awaited, ready to embark on their own journey towards wellness, a journey that Amelia hoped, with all her heart, would lead them closer to happiness.
