The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bear" McTavish's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he squinted at the horizon, watching the dust devils dance across the parched Nevada landscape. His Caterpillar D9R rumbled and growled beneath him, its steel teeth tearing into the earth with the same relentless fury as the desert sun. Bear adjusted his mirrored shades and let out a long sigh. Another day, another swathe of land carved open for progress, swallowed by the insatiable maw of the American West. 

He was alone out here, miles from civilization, surrounded only by scrub brush and the ghosts of boomtowns long gone. The silence was broken only by the roar of his engine and the occasional cawing of a raven circling overhead. It was a lonely existence, but Bear wouldn't have it any other way. He thrived on solitude, finding solace in the rhythmic hum of machinery and the tangible satisfaction of shaping the land with his own two hands.
