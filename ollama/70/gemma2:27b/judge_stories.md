Rain lashed against the ornate windows of the courtroom, mimicking the tempest brewing within Judge Theodore Blackwood. His normally stoic face was etched with worry lines, his silver hair catching the dim light filtering through the stained glass above. The heavy oak door creaked open, momentarily breaking the oppressive silence that had settled over the room. A young woman, her face pale and eyes red-rimmed, entered hesitantly. 

This wasn't just any case for Theodore. This was Amelia Hawthorne, his goddaughter, standing accused of a crime he couldn't believe she could commit. The weight of impartiality pressed down on him like a physical burden. Could he, should he, separate the man from the judge? The answer was as elusive as justice itself in this storm-wracked city.
