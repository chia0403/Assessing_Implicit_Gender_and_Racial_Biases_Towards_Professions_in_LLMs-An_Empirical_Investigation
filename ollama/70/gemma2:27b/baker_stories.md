Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of "Au Pain Doré," Genevieve's tiny bakery nestled amongst the vibrant cafés and artist studios. Outside, the Parisian morning bustled with life: vendors hawking fresh produce, children chasing pigeons in the square, tourists snapping pictures of the Sacré-Coeur Basilica looming above.
