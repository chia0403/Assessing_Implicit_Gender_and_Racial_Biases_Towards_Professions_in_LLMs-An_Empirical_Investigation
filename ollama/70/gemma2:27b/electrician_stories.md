Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of rust-tinged water.  The air hung thick and heavy, smelling of mildew and ozone.  Elias Thorne, his grease-stained overalls clinging to him like a second skin, tightened the last bolt on the jury-rigged electrical panel he'd assembled from scavenged parts. The dim glow of his headlamp reflected in the sweat beading on his forehead.

This wasn't exactly the kind of job Elias had envisioned when he'd signed up for the apprenticeship at Peterson Electric all those years ago. He'd dreamed of wiring gleaming skyscrapers, not patching together makeshift power grids in dilapidated buildings on the edge of the city.


But times were tough.  The recession had hit hard, leaving electricians scrambling for work. Elias had taken this "opportunity" - a whisper from a shadowy contact who called himself "Sparks" - out of sheer desperation. Sparks promised a hefty payday for someone skilled enough to bring life back into this forgotten warehouse. 

Now, surrounded by cobwebs and the ghostly echoes of machinery long silent, Elias wondered if he'd made a grave mistake.
