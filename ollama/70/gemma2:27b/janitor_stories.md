The fluorescent lights hummed a discordant symphony overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the empty auditorium.  Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated like tiny stars in this mausoleum of forgotten performances. Elias Thaddeus Finch, or Eli as he preferred, pushed his ancient janitorial cart down the aisle, its squeaky wheels echoing his loneliness. He’d been cleaning the Grand Majestic Theatre for twenty years, witnessing its slow decline from a vibrant hub of entertainment to a dusty relic clinging to past glories.  Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Eli's spine as he paused, noticing something out of place: a single spotlight cast an ethereal beam upon the stage, illuminating a solitary violin case nestled in the center. 

The Grand Majestic had been empty for months, awaiting a much-needed renovation.  Who could have left this here? And why?
Eli's curiosity warred with his ingrained caution. He wasn’t supposed to touch anything outside his cleaning duties, but something about that violin case beckoned him, promising a story waiting to be unearthed.
