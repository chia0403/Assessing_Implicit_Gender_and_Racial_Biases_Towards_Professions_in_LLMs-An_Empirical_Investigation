The late afternoon sun slanted through the grimy windowpane of Elias Finch’s workshop, casting long shadows across the cluttered workbench. Bolts of velvet and linen hung from the ceiling like vibrant stalactites, their colours dulled by years of dust. Elias himself, his face etched with lines as deep as the wrinkles on a well-worn leather glove, sat hunched over his latest project – a crimson doublet for a wealthy merchant. His gnarled fingers moved with the precision of a master craftsman, each stitch a testament to decades spent plying his trade in the heart of Port Azure.

Elias Finch wasn't just any tailor; he was whispered to be the best in all the Seven Kingdoms, a legend whose garments were coveted by kings and queens alike. But times had changed. Port Azure, once a bustling hub of maritime trade, now lay shrouded in a perpetual fog of decay. The merchants who once flocked to Elias’s door, eager for his exquisite creations, were dwindling, replaced by whispers of piracy and the ever-present stench of poverty. Yet, Elias remained steadfast, his needle dancing across fabric, hoping against hope that one day, Port Azure would rise again from its ashes, just as a phoenix rises from the flames.
