The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and coconut oil in "Shear Paradise", Eloise Beaumont's cozy salon nestled on a quiet side street in Charleston's historic district. Sunlight streamed through the arched windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the afternoon glow. Eloise, her fiery red curls piled atop her head in a loose bun, was meticulously trimming the split ends of Mrs. Delacroix's snow-white bob, humming along to Ella Fitzgerald crooning softly from the vintage jukebox tucked into the corner.

The rhythmic snip of her shears was abruptly interrupted by the insistent jangling of the salon doorbell. Eloise glanced up, expecting one of her regulars, but instead found herself facing a flustered young woman with wide, emerald green eyes and hair the color of spun moonlight. The stranger clutched a crumpled flyer in her hand, her knuckles white with tension.
