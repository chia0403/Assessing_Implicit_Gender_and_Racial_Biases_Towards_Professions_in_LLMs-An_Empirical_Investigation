The humid Florida air clung to Evangeline "Evie" Cortez like a second skin as she surveyed her sunrise yoga class. Palm trees swayed gently in the background, their fronds casting dancing shadows across the white sand beach. The turquoise waters of the Gulf of Mexico glittered invitingly just beyond the row of toned bodies stretching and breathing deeply in unison. Evie inhaled the salty air, savoring the peaceful moment before the symphony of grunts, groans, and "Namaste"s began.

This was her sanctuary â€“ a world away from the chaos of her life back in Miami. Here, amidst the gentle rhythm of waves and the chirping of unseen birds, she could shed the burdens of responsibility and simply be Evie: passionate instructor, dedicated yogi, and seeker of inner peace.
