The iron gates groaned like an arthritic giant as Thaddeus Blackwood heaved them open, the chill autumn wind whipping through the courtyard of Blackhaven Asylum. Moonlight cast long, skeletal shadows from the gnarled branches of the ancient oaks that ringed the crumbling edifice. The air hung heavy with the cloying sweetness of decaying leaves and something else, a faint metallic tang that Thaddeus had come to associate with madness.

He adjusted his bearskin hat, pulling it further down over his ears against the biting wind, and scanned the perimeter with practiced eyes. The asylum walls, built from black volcanic stone centuries ago, seemed to loom ever higher in the fading light, their jagged peaks silhouetted against the bruised sky. Thaddeus shivered, not entirely from the cold. Blackhaven held a certain...unease. A palpable dread that clung to its stones like moss.

Tonight, however, was no ordinary night. The full moon hung heavy and crimson, casting an eerie glow over the asylum grounds, amplifying the sense of foreboding. Thaddeus knew what the whispers amongst the guards meant: a blood moon. A night when the inmates were said to be most restless, most prone to violence. He tightened his grip on his halberd, its iron head glinting ominously in the moonlight, and steeled himself for whatever horrors the night might bring.
