Evangeline Thistlewick, her fingers hovering over a stack of meticulously alphabetized files, stole another glance at the heavy mahogany door. It had been nearly an hour since Mr. Blackwood had stormed out, muttering something about "incompetence" and "ruined negotiations".

She loved this office â€“ its rich history palpable in every mahogany bookcase, every leather-bound tome lining the walls. It was a world away from her cramped apartment overlooking a noisy alleyway.
