Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Urgent Care, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign into an anemic smear. Emilia Cartwright, her blonde braid escaping its elastic and snaking down her back, sighed as she surveyed the empty waiting room. Another Friday night, another graveyard shift. The rhythmic tick of the ancient clock above the receptionist's desk was the only sound besides the insistent drumming of the rain.

It allowed her time to catch up on charting, review medical journals, or simply lose herself in the swirling patterns of the raindrops racing down the glass. Tonight, however, a strange restlessness gnawed at her. The air felt heavy, pregnant with an unspoken anticipation that prickled her skin.

Just then, the door burst open, admitting a gust of wind and a figure shrouded in shadows. Emilia straightened in her chair, her gaze drawn to the newcomer.
