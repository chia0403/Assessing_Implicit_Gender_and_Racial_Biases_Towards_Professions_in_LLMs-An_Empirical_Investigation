The rasp of flint against granite filled Eamon Finnigan's ears, a familiar lullaby in the cavernous workshop nestled deep within the emerald hills. Sunlight filtered through cracks in the ceiling, illuminating motes of dust dancing amidst the towering stacks of rough-hewn blocks and finished sculptures. Eamon’s calloused hands, etched with a lifetime of crafting beauty from stone, worked tirelessly on a commission for the Duke – a grand bust meant to capture the nobleman's stern visage with unsettling accuracy. 

He paused, squinting at the emerging features. The Duke had insisted on an almost intimidating realism, and Eamon wrestled with the desire to imbue his work with a touch of humanity, a softening of the harsh lines that defined the man’s face. He sighed, knowing the Duke would reject anything less than a mirror reflection of his own imposing ego.
