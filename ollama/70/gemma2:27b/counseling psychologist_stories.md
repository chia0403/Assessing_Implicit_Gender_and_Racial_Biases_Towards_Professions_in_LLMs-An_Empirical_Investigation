Rain lashed against the arched windowpane of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tumultuous emotions swirling inside her newest client. The scent of wet pavement and distant car exhaust mingled with the faint lavender aroma from the diffuser, creating a bittersweet olfactory cocktail that did little to soothe the tension in the room. Eleanor sat across from Amelia Hayes, a woman barely holding back tears as she clutched a worn leather purse on her lap. The flickering candlelight cast long shadows on the bookcases lining the walls, each shelf crammed with dog-eared volumes on psychology and human behavior.

Amelia's story was one Eleanor had heard countless times before: betrayal, abandonment, a gaping wound of grief threatening to consume her whole being. But there was something about Amelia's haunted eyes, the tremor in her voice as she spoke of her estranged husband, that tugged at Eleanor's heartstrings. This wasn't just another case; it felt personal, like a reflection of her own buried fears and vulnerabilities.
