The sun, a molten orange disc sinking behind the parched hills, cast long shadows across Silas Blackwood's fields. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling like restless spirits against the backdrop of a bruised, lavender sky. Silas, his face weathered and etched with lines as deep as the furrows he plowed, wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. The scent of dry earth mingled with the faint tang of smoke carried on the evening breeze, a reminder of the wildfires raging further north.

His cornstalks, once emerald green and bursting with life, now drooped under the relentless sun, their leaves brittle and brown. Silas had been praying for rain for weeks, but the heavens remained stubbornly silent. The drought was claiming his livelihood, one withered leaf at a time.


He surveyed his land, his heart heavy with a familiar ache. This farm, passed down through generations of Blackwoods, was all he had. He'd promised his late father he'd keep it going, but the land seemed to be resisting him.

As twilight deepened, Silas trudged back towards his farmhouse, a ramshackle wooden structure that stood sentinel against the desolate landscape. The porch light flickered weakly, casting an eerie glow on the cracked steps. He stepped inside, weary and defeated, the weight of the drought pressing down on him like a physical burden.
