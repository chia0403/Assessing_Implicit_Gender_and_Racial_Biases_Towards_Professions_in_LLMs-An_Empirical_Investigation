Rain hammered against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, each drop a tiny fist pounding on the ancient glass. Eleanor Cavendish, her silver hair neatly pinned back from her wrinkled face, peered through the gloom, watching the wind whip leaves into frenzied dances along the cobblestone street. The library, usually bustling with patrons seeking refuge from the mundane world within its dusty shelves, was eerily silent today. A lone candle flickered on a mahogany table, casting long, dancing shadows across the worn Persian rug. Eleanor sighed, pushing aside a stack of overdue notices and reaching for her favorite volume – a leather-bound first edition of "Wuthering Heights."

Tonight, she craved the familiar comfort of Heathcliff's brooding presence, the wildness of the Yorkshire moors mirroring the storm raging outside. But as she lifted the book, a faint scratching sound caught her attention. It came from deep within the library's labyrinthine depths, near the restricted archives where ancient tomes whispered forgotten secrets. Eleanor hesitated, her heart quickening. No one ever ventured into those shadowed halls except for her – and certainly not on a night like this.
