The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and desperation. It clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's apron like a second skin, a pungent reminder of another grueling Friday night shift at "Big Bob's Burgers." The neon sign outside buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow on the cracked asphalt parking lot. Inside, chaos reigned: shrieking children, impatient families, and couples arguing over ketchup packets â€“ all orchestrated by Big Bob himself, a portly man with a booming voice and a permanent grease stain on his apron. Amelia sighed, wiping down a sticky table for the tenth time that hour.  This job was supposed to be temporary, a stepping stone to her dream of opening a bakery. But three years later, she was still slinging burgers and dreaming of buttercream frosting.
