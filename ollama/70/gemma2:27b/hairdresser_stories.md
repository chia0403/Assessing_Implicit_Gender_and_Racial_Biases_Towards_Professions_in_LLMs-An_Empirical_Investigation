The humid air hung thick in the salon, smelling of burnt hair and cheap lavender perfume. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpane, illuminating motes of dust dancing over Eloise Cartwright's worn-out workstation. Outside, the cicadas buzzed relentlessly, their song mirroring the anxious thrumming in Eloise's chest. Today was the day. The day she'd finally unveil her masterpiece: a gravity-defying updo for Mrs. Beaumont, the town matriarch and notoriously difficult client.

Eloise glanced nervously at the clock ticking above the mirror. 10:55 AM. Mrs. Beaumont was due any minute. Her fingers trembled as she adjusted the delicate pearl combs she'd painstakingly chosen for the style. Would it be enough? Would this intricate braid, adorned with shimmering orchids, finally earn her the respect and recognition she craved in this tiny, judgmental town?
