The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Estates, painting the meticulously trimmed hedges in hues of gold and amber.  Sweat beaded on Elias Thorne's brow as he wrestled with a stubborn rose bush, its thorny branches snagging at his work gloves.

Oakhaven was Elias' bread and butter, a sprawling community where every lawn looked like a putting green and hydrangeas bloomed in perfect, pastel spheres. It wasn't exactly exciting work, but it paid the bills and allowed Elias the freedom to pursue his true passion: cultivating rare orchids. He dreamt of opening his own nursery one day, filled with exotic blooms from across the globe. For now, though, he had a dozen rose bushes to tame before the sun dipped below the horizon.  

As Elias wrestled the last thorny branch into submission, a glint of metal caught his eye beneath the bush. Curious, he brushed aside the leaves and uncovered a silver locket nestled amongst the roots. It was intricately engraved with floral patterns, and a tiny ruby glowed like a blood droplet in its center. A shiver ran down Elias' spine as he picked it up. He had a feeling this locket wasn't just lost jewelry; it held a secret waiting to be unearthed.
