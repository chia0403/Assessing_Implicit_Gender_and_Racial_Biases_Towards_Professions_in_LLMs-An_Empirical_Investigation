Rain lashed against the windows of "Renew Physical Therapy," blurring the neon "Open" sign into an indistinct smear of color. Inside, Amelia Cartwright sighed, her breath fogging the already-steamy glass as she surveyed the empty waiting room. It was Tuesday, usually their busiest day, but a relentless downpour seemed to have kept everyone indoors.

Amelia ran a hand through her damp auburn curls, feeling the familiar ache in her own shoulders. Years of bending, lifting, and coaxing bodies back to strength had taken their toll. But she wouldn't trade it for anything. Seeing the flicker of hope in a patient's eyes when they managed that first tentative step, the joy of reclaiming mobility - those were rewards worth enduring any ache.

Just as Amelia was about to pull out her phone and catch up on some neglected paperwork, the bell above the door chimed, announcing a visitor. A man, bundled in a dripping raincoat, stepped inside, his face obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat.
