Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Beatrice Winthrop’s office, blurring the already gloomy autumn afternoon into an impressionistic watercolour. The smell of damp earth and fallen leaves seeped in through the cracked windowpane, mingling with the stale scent of institutional coffee and teenage angst that permanently permeated the guidance counsellor's domain. Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of silver hair behind her ear.

Her desk, piled high with college applications, scholarship forms, and pleas for help disguised as timetable requests, felt like a monument to adolescent indecision. Today, however, she was bracing herself for something far more daunting than the usual run-of-the-mill teenage drama. A new student was arriving – rumour had it he’d been expelled from his previous school under mysterious circumstances. His name was Ethan Blackwood, and Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that this encounter wouldn't be a simple case of course selection and pep talks.
