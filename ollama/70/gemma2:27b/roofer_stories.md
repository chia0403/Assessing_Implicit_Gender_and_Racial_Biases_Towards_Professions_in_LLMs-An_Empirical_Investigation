The August sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning the sweat under his bandana into a scalding river.  He shifted his weight on the slanted shingles, gritting his teeth against the ache in his lower back. Below him, the manicured lawns of Oakhaven stretched out like a green carpet, dotted with houses that looked impossibly pristine from this height. Silas scoffed. He knew better than anyone that beneath those gleaming facades lurked cracked foundations, leaky pipes, and a whole host of other hidden maladies.

He glanced at the ornate Victorian mansion he was currently repairing. Mrs. Davenport, its wealthy owner, had called him in to fix a few "minor leaks." But Silas suspected it was more than just water seeping through the aging slate roof. He'd noticed odd cracks running along the chimney and a faint, unsettling smell of damp earth emanating from beneath the eaves. Something wasn't right, but what?
