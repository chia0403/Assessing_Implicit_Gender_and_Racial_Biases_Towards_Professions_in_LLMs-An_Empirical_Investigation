Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane, blurring the neon glow of "Dr. Elias Thorne's Chiropractic Clinic" into an impressionistic smear of red and green. Inside, Elias Thorne straightened his tie, a sigh escaping him as he watched the deluge outside. The late afternoon storm had chased away the last few patients, leaving him with nothing but the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner and the faint smell of liniment lingering in the air.

Elias loved helping people. He relished the feeling of relief that washed over a patient's face as he realigned their spine, easing years of pain with a practiced twist and crack. But lately, something felt off. His once bustling clinic was eerily quiet, his appointments dwindling. Elias couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to it than just the usual seasonal slowdown.

He glanced at the newspaper lying open on his desk, its headline screaming about a mysterious new ailment plaguing the city – a strange paralysis that seemed to strike without warning. Could this be connected to his dwindling clientele? A shiver ran down Elias's spine.  He had always prided himself on understanding the body's mechanics, but this… this was something entirely different.

Driven by a mix of curiosity and apprehension, Elias picked up his phone, dialing the number for the city health department. This strange illness, whatever it was, needed investigating. He felt a responsibility to his community, to figure out what was happening and how he could help.
