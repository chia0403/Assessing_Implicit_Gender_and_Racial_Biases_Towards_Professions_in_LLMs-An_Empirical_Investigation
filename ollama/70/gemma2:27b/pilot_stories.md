The rusty wind chimes hanging from Captain Evangeline "Eva" Thorne's porch clanged discordantly against the howling gale.  They were her grandmother’s, salvaged from the wreckage of their old farmhouse after a particularly vicious cyclone swept through the Arizona desert twenty years ago. Eva ran a hand over the chipped paint and cracked wood, feeling the ghost of her grandmother’s touch lingering there.

Her gaze shifted towards the horizon, where the setting sun bled fiery orange into bruised purple clouds.  Beyond the dusty expanse lay the weathered landing strip she'd painstakingly carved out of the barren earth years ago. Tonight, it awaited a visitor - one Eva hadn't seen in far too long. 


The air thrummed with anticipation, mixed with a sharp tang of unease. This meeting was more than just catching up with an old friend; it held the potential to change everything for Eva and the struggling community she called home.
