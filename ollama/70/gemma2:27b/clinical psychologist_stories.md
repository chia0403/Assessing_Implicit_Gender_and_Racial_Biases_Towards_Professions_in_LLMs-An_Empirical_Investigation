The rain lashed against Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office window, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. It was always the same after a session with Daniel. The weight of his despair, the tangled threads of his trauma, clung to her like damp moss. Outside, the city lights blurred into an impressionistic painting, but in here, everything felt sharp, defined by the edges of Daniel's pain. 

Her small office, tucked away on the third floor of a converted Victorian townhouse, was usually a haven. The scent of lavender from the diffuser battled with the metallic tang of Eleanor’s anxiety. Bookshelves lined the walls, crammed with weighty tomes on human behavior and psychology. A worn leather armchair faced her desk, inviting vulnerability and confession.

But today, even the calming presence of Buddha's serene gaze from its perch above the fireplace couldn't soothe the unease in Eleanor's chest. Daniel’s case was proving to be more than a simple bout of depression. There were whispers of something darker, something she couldn't quite grasp, lurking beneath the surface.
