Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the kennels, each drop a tiny explosion echoing through the cavernous space. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth sighed, tucking her auburn braid behind her ear as she wrestled open the heavy door to the food storage room. The smell of wet dog and disinfectant hung thick in the air, punctuated by the occasional mournful howl from one of the anxious residents. 

Ellie's haven, Hopewell Animal Sanctuary, was a bustling refuge on the edge of a sleepy coastal town, nestled between rolling green hills and the crashing waves of the North Sea.  Abandoned, lost, and neglected creatures found their way here - scruffy terriers with soulful eyes, regal Siamese cats with haughty expressions, even a grumpy old goat named Gertie who had a penchant for headbutting unsuspecting volunteers. 

Today, however, Ellie felt a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. The sanctuary was at capacity, resources were stretched thin, and the latest arrivals - a litter of shivering puppies found huddled in an abandoned shed - needed immediate attention.  As she scooped kibble into overflowing bowls, she couldn't shake the feeling that something else was wrong, something lurking beneath the surface of this familiar routine. A chill, unrelated to the storm raging outside, crept down her spine.
