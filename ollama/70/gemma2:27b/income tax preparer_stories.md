Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor "Ellie" Finch's cramped office, mimicking the drumming anxiety in her chest. The flickering fluorescent light above cast long, skeletal shadows across the mountains of paperwork piled on her desk. It was April 14th, and Ellie, a seasoned income tax preparer with a reputation for untangling even the most convoluted financial knots, was facing her busiest day yet.

Her office, tucked away in a dingy strip mall on the outskirts of Willow Creek, wasn't exactly conducive to Zen. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. A queue snaked out the door, each face etched with a mixture of hope and trepidation as they clutched folders overflowing with receipts, W-2s, and the occasional frantic scribble on a napkin. Ellie sighed, her fingers hovering over a half-eaten bagel. Another year, another tax season crucible.
