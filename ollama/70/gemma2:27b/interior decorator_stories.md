The incessant hammering from next door vibrated through Eloise Beaumont's perfectly manicured fingernails. She sighed, her shoulders slumping beneath the weight of silk charmeuse draped across them. Her client, Mrs. Van Derlyn, wouldn't be pleased with this interruption to their meticulously planned schedule for the afternoon. Eloise glanced at the antique grandfather clock ticking away in the corner of the opulent living room â€“ 2:47 PM. Time enough to make a polite inquiry, she decided.

Eloise was known throughout Greenwich Village for her impeccable taste and ability to transform drab spaces into havens of exquisite elegance. Her apartment, nestled above a bustling bakery on Bleecker Street, was a testament to her own design philosophy: a harmonious blend of vintage charm and modern sophistication. Today, however, it felt like the tranquility she cultivated within these walls was under siege.

She smoothed down the folds of her crimson silk dress, picked up a silver tray laden with delicate macarons, and headed towards the hallway. The hammering seemed to intensify as she neared the door separating her apartment from the one next door, where a new tenant had recently moved in.
