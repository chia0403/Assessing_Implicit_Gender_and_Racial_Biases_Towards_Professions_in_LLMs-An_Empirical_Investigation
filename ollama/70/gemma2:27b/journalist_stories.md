The neon glow of "The Blue Flamingo" sign cast an unsettling green hue across Amelia Rose Hawthorne's rain-slicked trench coat. Rain lashed down in sheets, blurring the already murky streetlights of New Orleans’ French Quarter. A symphony of jazz and drunken laughter spilled from the bar, a jarring contrast to the chilling scene playing out inside Amelia's head.

Just hours ago, she'd received an anonymous tip: a lead on the infamous "Voodoo Queen" case – a string of ritualistic murders plaguing the city for months. The tipster claimed to know the identity of the killer, but insisted on meeting in person, here, at this grimy dive bar known more for its questionable clientele than its cocktails.


Amelia hesitated. This was risky. Dangerously so. But the Voodoo Queen case had become an obsession, a labyrinthine puzzle she couldn't let go of. The victims, seemingly chosen at random, were found with strange symbols etched into their skin, whispers of voodoo curses swirling around each gruesome discovery.

Taking a deep breath, Amelia pushed open the heavy wooden door, the scent of stale beer and cheap perfume assaulting her senses. She was stepping into the unknown, ready to face whatever lay within The Blue Flamingo's murky depths.
