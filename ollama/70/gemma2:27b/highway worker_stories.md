The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he leaned against his shovel, wiping sweat from his brow with a grimy rag. The asphalt shimmered in the heat haze, making the endless ribbon of Highway 93 seem to ripple like a mirage. Eli squinted towards the distant horizon where the jagged peaks of the Superstition Mountains pierced the sky, their purple shadows stretching long across the barren landscape.

Eli was a man built for this unforgiving environment â€“ tall and lean with sun-weathered skin and calloused hands. He'd spent most of his life on these roads, patching potholes, repaving lanes, and battling dust devils that whipped up without warning. It wasn't glamorous work, but it paid the bills and gave him a sense of purpose, knowing he was keeping this artery of commerce flowing smoothly across the desert. 


Today, however, something felt different. A nagging unease prickled at the back of Eli's neck as he scanned the deserted highway. The usual symphony of cicadas and wind seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling silence. Even the vultures circling overhead seemed to be watching him with an unnerving intensity.
