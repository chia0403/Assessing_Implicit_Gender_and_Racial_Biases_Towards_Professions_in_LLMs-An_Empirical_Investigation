The air hung thick with salt and seaweed, the scent clinging to Evelyn Blackwood's worn canvas jacket like a stubborn memory.  She crouched low on the jagged rocks, framing the scene through her lens: the sun, a fiery orb sinking into the churning grey Atlantic, casting long shadows across the windswept beach. This was her sanctuary, this wild stretch of Cornish coastline where the elements raged and the land itself seemed to breathe with an ancient power. Evelyn came here seeking solace, inspiration, and the perfect shot - one that captured not just the beauty, but the raw, untamed soul of the sea.

Today, however, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickling at the back of her neck, as if unseen eyes watched her from the churning waves.  Evelyn dismissed it as nerves; she was always on edge when shooting near sunset, racing against the fading light. But as she adjusted the aperture and focused on the horizon, where the sky bled into the water in a bruise of purple and orange, she couldn't shake the feeling that something extraordinary was about to unfold.
