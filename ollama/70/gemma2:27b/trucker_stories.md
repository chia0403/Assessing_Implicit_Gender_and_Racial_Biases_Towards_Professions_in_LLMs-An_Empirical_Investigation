The rusty diner sign creaked in the wind, its neon tubes flickering like dying embers. "Jolene's Eats," it declared in chipped paint, promising greasy spoons and lukewarm coffee - exactly what Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins needed after 16 hours on the road. Bart shifted his rig, a hulking Peterbilt christened "The Iron Duchess," into park, the air brakes sighing with relief.

The late summer sun beat down on the asphalt lot, baking the smell of diesel and dust into the air. A lone tumbleweed rolled past, a ghostly reminder of the desolate beauty surrounding him. Bart was somewhere in the heart of Nevada, miles from anything resembling civilization. The GPS had promised a rest stop, but Jolene's Eats was all he found: a solitary beacon of humanity on this endless ribbon of highway.
