The whir of the KitchenAid mixer battled with the thump-thump-thump of Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's heart as she piped delicate buttercream roses onto the pristine white canvas of a three-tiered wedding cake. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of her tiny bakery, "Amelia's Sweet Delights," illuminating swirls of sugar dust and the rainbow of fondant colors stacked neatly on her counter. Outside, the bustling city of Charleston hummed with life, but inside Amelia's world contracted to the delicate task at hand. 

This was no ordinary wedding cake; this was a chance for Amelia to prove herself. The bride, Amelia's childhood best friend Lily, had entrusted her with creating the centerpiece of the most important day of her life.  Every petal, every pearl-like sugar bead, held the weight of Amelia's hopes and dreams.
