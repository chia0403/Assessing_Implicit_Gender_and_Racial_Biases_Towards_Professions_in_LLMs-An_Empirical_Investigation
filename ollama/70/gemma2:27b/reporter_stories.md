The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Clover" cast an unsettling green hue across Amelia Cartwright's face as she clutched her notepad tighter. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane behind her, mirroring the storm brewing inside.

The clientele, a motley crew of weary souls seeking solace at the bottom of a glass, paid Amelia little heed as she slid onto a stool at the bar.
