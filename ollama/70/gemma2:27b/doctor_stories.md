The humid air hung thick in the makeshift clinic, a converted shipping container precariously perched on the edge of a dusty refugee camp. Dr. Elias Amin adjusted his glasses, the lenses fogging momentarily from the heat. Outside, children shrieked and played amidst piles of discarded tires and plastic sheeting, their laughter incongruous with the air of desolation that permeated the camp. Elias sighed, tracing the worn rim of the rusty examination table with his finger. He hadn't intended to be here, in this forgotten corner of the world.  He was a cardiothoracic surgeon, renowned for his steady hand and innovative techniques. But the war had changed everything. The call for volunteers echoed in his soul, drowning out the whispers of comfort and familiarity. Now, armed with rudimentary supplies and an overflowing compassion, he tended to wounds both physical and emotional. 

Today's patient was a young girl named Amina, her eyes wide with fear as she clutched a ragged doll. Her cough, sharp and insistent, spoke of something deeper than the common cold that ravaged the camp. Elias steeled himself, knowing the limitations of his resources. He could only hope to offer some solace amidst the storm.
