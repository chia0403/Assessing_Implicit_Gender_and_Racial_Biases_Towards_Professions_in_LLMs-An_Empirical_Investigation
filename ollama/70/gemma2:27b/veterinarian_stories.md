Rain lashed against the windows of "Critter Comfort," blurring the neon sign that blinked cheerfully despite the tempest outside.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and anxiety. Dr. Amelia Brighton chewed on her lower lip, anxiously pacing the length of the exam room. A calico cat named Clementine lay whimpering on the stainless steel table, her tiny body trembling. 

Amelia had been a veterinarian for ten years, but she'd never encountered a case quite like this. Clementine's owner, a frantic young woman named Sarah, had brought her in just before closing, claiming the cat had suddenly become lethargic and withdrawn. Amelia had run preliminary tests, but nothing conclusive had emerged.  The mystery gnawed at her.

With the storm raging on outside, mirroring the turmoil within her, Amelia knew she couldn't rest until she figured out what was wrong with Clementine.
