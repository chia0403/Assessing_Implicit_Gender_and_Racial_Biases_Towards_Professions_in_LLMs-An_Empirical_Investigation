The bell shrieked, its shrill cry echoing through the cavernous hallways of Northwood High like a wounded bird. Elias Finch winced, massaging his temples. Another Monday morning, another onslaught of teenage angst and half-hearted attempts at understanding quadratic equations.  His classroom, bathed in the pale morning light filtering through dusty windows, felt more like a battlefield than a place of learning. Papers littered desks, discarded water bottles lay forgotten amongst textbooks, and the lingering scent of stale pizza hung heavy in the air. 

Elias sighed, pushing himself away from his desk piled high with ungraded essays. He yearned for the quiet solitude of his cluttered apartment, surrounded by stacks of worn paperbacks and the comforting aroma of freshly brewed coffee. But duty called. Thirty pairs of eyes, glazed with varying degrees of boredom and defiance, awaited him. 

Today's lesson: the Pythagorean Theorem. Elias hoped against hope that it wouldn't devolve into another chaotic debate about the merits of Tik Tok versus Instagram.
