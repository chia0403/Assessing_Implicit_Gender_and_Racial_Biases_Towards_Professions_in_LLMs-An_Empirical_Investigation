The air in "Nails by Natalia" hung thick with the scent of acetone and lavender polish. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, illuminating the rainbow spectrum of bottles lining Natalia Petrova's workbench. Outside, the relentless summer sun beat down on the faded brick facade of her salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in Brooklyn.  A ceiling fan whirred overhead, doing little to combat the humid heat that clung to Natalia like a second skin.

She sighed, leaning back in her ergonomically-designed chair (a splurge she'd justified as an investment in her aching back), and surveyed the empty salon. It was Monday afternoon – traditionally the slowest day – but even for a Monday, things were quieter than usual.  Natalia missed the chatter, the clinking of nail files against acrylics, the gentle hum of conversation punctuated by bursts of laughter.

Suddenly, the jingling bell above the door announced a customer. Natalia straightened up, plastering on her trademark welcoming smile. "Welcome to Nails by Natalia! How can I help you today?" she chirped, hoping this client wouldn't be another one wanting the latest TikTok trend that required three different glitters and miniature rhinestones glued onto each nail.

The woman who entered was unlike any Natalia had seen before. Dressed in a flowing black gown with silver embroidery, her long, ebony hair cascaded down her back like a silken waterfall.  Her eyes, as dark and deep as the night sky, met Natalia's with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine. "I need," she said, her voice a low, melodious whisper, "a transformation."

Natalia knew this was going to be anything but a normal Monday afternoon.
