The humid air clung to Seraphina "Sera" Beaumont like a second skin as she wrestled with the rusted gate latch. The Victorian mansion loomed above her, its paint peeling like sunburnt flesh, overgrown ivy creeping up the walls like grasping fingers. It was a beautiful corpse, whispering stories of forgotten grandeur and echoing with the ghosts of laughter long silenced. Sera, however, wasn't interested in the whispers or the ghosts; she was interested in potential buyers.

This house, perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, had been sitting vacant for years, a testament to the turbulent past of its former owner, a reclusive artist who vanished one stormy night, leaving behind nothing but unfinished canvases and whispered rumours. 


Sera took a deep breath, steeling herself against the eerie stillness that blanketed the property. Today was her chance to breathe life back into this forgotten jewel, to find someone who could see past the decay and imagine the possibilities hidden within its crumbling walls.

Today, she hoped, was the day the whispers would turn into cheers.
