Rain lashed against the ambulance window, blurring the neon glow of the city into an impressionistic smear of red and yellow. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Chen wrestled with the IV line, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her patient, a gaunt man clutching his chest, wheezed heavily, each breath a ragged gasp. Amy's practiced hands worked quickly, securing the needle and threading the tube, all while murmuring soothing words she barely registered herself.

The sirens wailed a mournful song, cutting through the drumming of rain on the roof. They were approaching St. Jude's, a behemoth of brick and steel perched atop a hill overlooking the city. Amy glanced at her partner, Marco, whose face was grim beneath his thick eyebrows. He met her gaze for a fleeting moment, a silent acknowledgment of the gravity of their situation.

This wasn't just another chest pain call. This man, barely clinging to life, had a story etched into every line on his weathered face, a story Amy desperately wanted to hear, but one that was slipping away with each shallow breath.
