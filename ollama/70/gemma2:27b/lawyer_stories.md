The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling purple glow across Amelia Beaumont's face as she stared out the rain-streaked window. The air inside her cramped office hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Papers overflowed from her desk, threatening to engulf the worn leather chair she perched on.

Outside, the downpour mirrored the storm raging within Amelia. She was drowning in a caseload that would have made Hercules sweat, facing eviction from this very office space, and grappling with the nagging feeling that she'd taken a wrong turn somewhere along her ambitious legal journey.  It wasn't supposed to be like this. The prestigious law firm she'd clawed her way into straight out of Yale had imploded in a spectacular scandal involving embezzlement and forged documents. Amelia, unscathed but disillusioned, had hung out her shingle, hoping for the idealistic practice she’d once envisioned.

But reality was proving far grittier.

Tonight, however, promised a glimmer of hope. A knock on the door brought her back to the present. Her heart thumped with anticipation as she straightened her rumpled blouse and called out, "Come in."

Standing hesitantly in the doorway was a woman Amelia hadn't seen before – young, with eyes wide and worried, clutching a manila envelope like a lifeline. This, Amelia thought, could be it. The case that would turn everything around.
