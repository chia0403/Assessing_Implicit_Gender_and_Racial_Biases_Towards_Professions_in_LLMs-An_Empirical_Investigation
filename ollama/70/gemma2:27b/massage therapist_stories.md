Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Serenity Now," the steady drumming echoing Amelia Rose Hawthorne's pounding headache. The usually soothing aroma of lavender and chamomile was overwhelmed by the cloying scent of damp wool from her perpetually damp coat. A Friday night rush had left her weary, both physically and mentally, despite the calming nature of her work. Outside, the storm raged on, mimicking the turmoil brewing within Amelia.

She stared at the flickering neon sign across the street, its vibrant green promising "Cold Beer & Hot Wings."  Amelia craved neither but found herself inexplicably drawn to the warmth and bustle emanating from the dimly lit establishment. Perhaps a hot cup of tea and a change of scenery would soothe her frazzled nerves. As she debated whether to brave the downpour, the bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of a new client.

Sighing, Amelia straightened her linen tunic and plastered on a smile. Tonight was going to be a long one.
