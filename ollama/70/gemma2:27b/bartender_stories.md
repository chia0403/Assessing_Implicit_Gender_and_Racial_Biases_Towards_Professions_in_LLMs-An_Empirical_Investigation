The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow across Elias Finnigan's tired face. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the already faded cityscape beyond. Inside "The Crooked Quill," the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the melancholy murmur of late-night drinkers. Elias, his apron stained with a constellation of spilled drinks and regret, wiped down the counter with a sigh. The usual crowd was sparse tonight â€“ a weary businessman nursing a double scotch in the corner, a pair of college students giggling over cheap beer, and a lone woman staring forlornly into her empty glass.

Elias knew their stories, could read them like pages from an open book. He'd been tending bar at "The Crooked Quill" for ten years, long enough to become intimately familiar with the weight of human sorrow, the fleeting moments of joy, and the relentless cycle of hope and despair that played out nightly within these four walls.
