The air in the cramped repair shop hung thick with the scent of ozone and solder.  Dim fluorescent lights flickered above rusted workbenches littered with disassembled radios, their guts spilling out like spilled entrails. Outside, the humid Georgia night pulsed with cicadas and distant thunder. 

Elara Mae Davenport ran a calloused thumb over a cracked vacuum tube, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her silver braid, usually coiled neatly atop her head, had escaped its confines and cascaded down her back, catching on a stray wire.  She swore under her breath, tugging the errant strand free. 

Tonight was supposed to be a quiet one - just Elara and her trusty soldering iron coaxing life back into an antique Philco. But the insistent buzz of the shop's landline phone shattered the stillness. Elara sighed, wiping her greasy hands on a stained rag before answering.  The voice on the other end, breathless and frantic, spoke of strange signals, ghostly whispers, and a radio that wouldn’t be silenced.

Elara knew then that tonight wouldn’t be quiet after all.
