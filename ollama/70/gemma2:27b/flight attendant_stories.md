The incessant hum of the Boeing 747 filled Eleanor Ainsworth's ears, a familiar lullaby that lulled most passengers into a state of blissful ignorance. But Eleanor wasn't one for blissful ignorance. Thirty thousand feet above the Atlantic Ocean, somewhere between Dublin and New York City, she felt the prickle of unease that had become her unwelcome companion on long-haul flights.  

The turbulence was nothing out of the ordinary, yet it rattled the cabin with an unnerving intensity. Eleanor gripped the galley counter, steadying herself as a tray of untouched coffee cups clattered to the floor. She glanced at the faces around her â€“ tired eyes glazed over by movies, children squirming in their seats, couples huddled together, oblivious to the subtle shift in atmosphere. But Eleanor couldn't ignore it. Something felt wrong. Deeply, unsettlingly wrong.
