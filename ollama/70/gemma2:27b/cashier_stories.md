The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the aisles of "Bargain Bites," where Amelia Cartwright diligently scanned cans of discounted beans and off-brand cereal.  Her fingers danced across the barcode reader with practiced ease, her mind miles away in a sun-drenched meadow filled with wildflowers and the drowsy buzz of bumblebees. This was Amelia's escape: a haven constructed from daydreams woven between scanning expired yogurt and reminding grumpy customers that coupons expired two weeks ago. 

Today, however, the usual rhythm of Bargain Bites was disrupted by an unexpected visitor.  A tall, gaunt man with eyes the color of faded denim shuffled up to her register, his thin frame seeming to absorb the dim light around him. He clutched a single, wilted rose in his bony hand. Amelia felt a prickle of curiosity as she waited for him to speak.
