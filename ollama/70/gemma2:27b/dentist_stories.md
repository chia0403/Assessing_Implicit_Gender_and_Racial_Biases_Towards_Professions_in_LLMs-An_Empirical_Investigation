Rain lashed against the frosted glass of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood's office window, blurring the lights of the sleepy seaside town into an Impressionist painting. Ellie sighed, her breath fogging the already cloudy pane. Another Thursday night in Seahaven, and business was slower than a snail in molasses.

Her practice, nestled above Mrs. Peabody's charming but decidedly dusty bookstore, usually hummed with the comforting whir of drills and the occasional anxious squeak from a patient. Tonight, however, the silence was broken only by the rhythmic tick of her grandfather clock and the mournful groan of the old building settling beneath her feet.

Ellie rubbed her tired eyes, her gaze lingering on a chipped porcelain tooth she'd salvaged from an antique shop months ago. It sat perched on her desk, a silent reminder of the delicate balance between art and science that defined her profession. But tonight, Ellie felt more like an artist whose canvas had gone blank than a skilled practitioner mending smiles. 

Just as she was about to call it a night, the bell above the bookstore door chimed, announcing a visitor brave enough to venture out in the storm.
