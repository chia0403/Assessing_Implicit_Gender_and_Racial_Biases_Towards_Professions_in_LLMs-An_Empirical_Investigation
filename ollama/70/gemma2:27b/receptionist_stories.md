The flickering fluorescent lights of the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby cast an anemic glow on Eloise Evangeline Hawthorne's face as she straightened a stack of brochures with the precision of a surgeon.  Outside, the Parisian night hummed with its usual chaotic symphony: car horns blaring, vendors hawking their wares in melodious singsong, and the distant thrumming of accordion music from a nearby cafe. But inside the Grand Blackwood, a strange stillness held sway. It was past midnight, and even the ghosts of guests past seemed to have retreated to their spectral rooms for the night. 

Eloise sighed, her fingers tracing the embossed lettering on a "Visit the Eiffel Tower" pamphlet. This wasn't how she'd envisioned her Parisian adventure. She'd dreamt of strolling along cobbled streets, sipping café au lait in sun-drenched squares, and maybe even catching a glimpse of a beret-clad artist sketching by the Seine. Instead, she was stuck behind this mahogany desk, fielding calls from confused tourists who couldn't find their rooms and placating irate guests whose room service orders were mysteriously delayed.  

Tonight felt particularly desolate. The only sound besides her own sigh was the rhythmic tick of the grandfather clock in the corner, each chime a mocking reminder of the precious hours slipping away. Eloise yearned for something – anything – to break the monotony.
