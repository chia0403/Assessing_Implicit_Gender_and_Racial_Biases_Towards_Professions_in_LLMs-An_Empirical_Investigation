The scent of crayons and glue hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's soul. Today, however, it did little to quell the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. Outside, the late September sun cast long shadows across the playground, painting the familiar sandbox and swings with an eerie twilight hue. Inside Room 203, twenty-five five-year-olds buzzed with pre-Halloween excitement, their faces painted with glitter glue and anticipation.

Eleanor dismissed them as childish imaginings at first, but a creeping unease refused to be silenced.
