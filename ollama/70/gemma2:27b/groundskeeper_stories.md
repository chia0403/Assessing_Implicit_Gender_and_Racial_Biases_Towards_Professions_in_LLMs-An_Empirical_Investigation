The morning mist clung to the ancient oaks like spectral shrouds, obscuring the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor in an ethereal haze. Elias Thornbury, his weathered hands gripping a steaming mug of tea, surveyed the scene with a critical eye. The dew-kissed roses needed tending, the azalea bushes were beginning to droop under the weight of their blooms, and a mischievous squirrel had already pilfered half a dozen acorns from the carefully curated display beneath the grand willow tree.

Elias, a man who knew every twist of ivy and the precise moment each flower bud would unfurl, sighed. Blackwood Manor was his sanctuary, his canvas upon which he painted with living green and vibrant blooms. For thirty years, he had coaxed life from the stubborn earth, sculpted hedges into intricate shapes, and whispered secrets to the wind that rustled through the leaves. He knew every inch of this place better than he knew himself, and yet today, a strange unease gnawed at him. The silence felt too heavy, the mist too still. Something was amiss.
