The sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's shoulders as he surveyed his spread. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling up rusty red particles that stung his eyes. The once-lush meadows were now brittle and brown, cracked like ancient pottery. Even the hardy Texas Longhorns, usually stoic and resilient, seemed listless in the oppressive heat.

Eli ran a calloused hand over his weathered face, worry etched deep into the lines around his blue eyes. Three years of drought had ravaged Blackwood Ranch, pushing it to the brink. The creek that snaked through the property was reduced to a trickle, the waterholes drying up faster than he could replenish them. He'd already sold off half his herd, a painful decision that left him feeling hollow.

But Eli Blackwood wasnâ€™t a man to give up easily. Generations of Blackwoods had weathered storms on this land, and he wouldn't be the one to break the chain.  He squinted towards the horizon, where a sliver of cloud promised rain. Maybe, just maybe, this drought was finally coming to an end. He tightened his grip on the reins of his chestnut mare, Hope, her name a cruel irony in these desperate times. "Come on, girl," he murmured, urging her forward.  "We need to find that spring before it dries up too."
