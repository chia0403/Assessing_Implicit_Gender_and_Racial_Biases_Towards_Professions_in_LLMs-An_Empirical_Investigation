The rain hammered against the attic window like a thousand tiny fists, each blow echoing through Elara Beaumont's cramped workspace.  She sat hunched over her ancient typewriter, its keys clicking rhythmically against the worn-out ribbon as she wrestled with the stubborn final chapter of her gothic novel. Outside, the wind howled through the gnarled branches of the ancient oak tree that dominated the overgrown garden, casting grotesque shadows on the peeling wallpaper. 

Elara sighed, running a hand through her tangled auburn hair.  Inspiration, once so abundant, had dried up like the well in the forgotten corner of her grandmother's estate. She glanced at the overflowing ashtray beside her, its contents mirroring the ash-grey despair settling in her chest. Perhaps a walk would clear her head. Or maybe another cup of lukewarm tea.


She rose, her joints protesting with a symphony of pops and creaks. The attic room, cluttered with stacks of dusty manuscripts and overflowing bookshelves, felt oppressive in the dim light filtering through the grimy windowpane. A sudden gust rattled the windowpanes, sending a shiver down Elara's spine. It was time for a change of scenery.
