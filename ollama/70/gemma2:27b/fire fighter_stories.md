The siren's wail ripped through the drowsy morning quiet, jolting Elias "Eli" Blackwood awake. Eli slammed his fist on the snooze button, momentarily silencing the beast, but he knew it wouldn't stay quiet for long. He sat up in bed, the familiar weight of responsibility settling onto his shoulders like a heavy coat. Another day, another fire to fight.

Outside, the sky was just beginning to blush with the promise of dawn over the jagged peaks of the Cascade Mountains. Smoke, thick and black, already stained the horizon, a grim harbinger of the chaos that awaited them. Eli lived in Pine Ridge, a small town nestled amidst towering pines and whispering streams, where life moved at a slower pace – until a fire erupted, tearing through the tranquility like a ravenous beast. Today, it seemed, the beast was hungry.

Eli pulled on his worn leather boots, the familiar scuff marks telling tales of countless battles fought against flames. As he headed for the kitchen, the radio crackled to life, spitting out garbled reports of a wildfire raging near Blackwood Lake, threatening homes and engulfing acres of forest in its insatiable maw. Eli knew this lake well – he'd spent summers swimming in its icy depths, fishing with his grandfather, sharing stories under the starlit sky. Now, it seemed, the memories were about to be consumed by fire.
