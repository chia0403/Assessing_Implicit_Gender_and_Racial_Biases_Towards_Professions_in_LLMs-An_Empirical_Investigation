The insistent buzz of the air purifier filled Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s small office with a white noise hum that usually soothed her frayed nerves. Today, however, it grated on her like fingernails scraping down a chalkboard.  Sunlight streamed through the window, highlighting the dust motes dancing in its rays and making the worn floral pattern on her chair seem even more faded. 

Outside, the normally bustling street of downtown Charleston was eerily quiet. A strange stillness had settled over the city since dawn, punctuated only by the occasional distant siren wail. Amelia glanced nervously at the clock. It was already 10:30 AM and Dr. Lewis, her boss, hadn't shown up. He'd promised to be in early today for a consultation with a new patient – an important one, he'd said cryptically.

Amelia tapped her fingers on the chipped countertop, anxiety gnawing at her stomach. The strange silence, coupled with Dr. Lewis’s cryptic words, had stirred a disquiet she couldn't shake.
