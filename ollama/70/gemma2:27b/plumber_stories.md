The stench of mildew hung heavy in the air, clinging to Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's overalls like a bad memory. He squinted through the dim basement light, his headlamp casting grotesque shadows on the exposed brick walls and rusting pipes snaking across the ceiling. Teddy grimaced, already regretting taking this call. The address: 13 Blackmoor Lane, was nestled deep in the old part of town, where Victorian houses hunched under weeping willows, their windows like vacant eyes staring out into the fog-choked streets.

He'd been warned about Blackmoor Lane - whispers of strange noises at night, flickering lights, and the unsettling feeling that someone, or something, was always watching. But Teddy, a man who prided himself on his pragmatism, scoffed at such superstitions. Plumbing problems were plumbing problems, regardless of spooky rumors.

Now, standing in the dank basement with water bubbling ominously from a cracked pipe, he wasn't so sure. A chill snaked down his spine, and for a fleeting moment, he could have sworn he heard a low, guttural growl echoing through the house above.
