Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain poured down on the small town of Ravenswood like a dirty blanket, shrouding its streets and alleys in a damp, gray mist. Inside his cramped but cozy plumbing shop on Main Street, Jasper "Jazz" Thompson wiped the sweat from his brow as he surveyed the morning's appointments. It was going to be a long day.

Jazz, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-40s with a thick beard and a warm smile, had spent years perfecting the art of fixing leaky faucets and unclogging stubborn drains. His shop, Thompson's Pipes, was the go-to destination for all things plumbing-related in Ravenswood. As he checked his schedule for the day, Jazz couldn't help but feel a sense of familiarity with the rhythms of small-town life.

The phone on his desk jolted him out of his reverie, shrill and insistent. "Thompson's Pipes, this is Jazz," he answered, his voice calm and reassuring. He listened for a moment, his expression growing more serious by the second.

"What do we got?" he asked finally, his tone turning professional. The dispatcher on the other end of the line gave him a brief rundown on the situation – a burst pipe in the historic mansion on Elm Street, with water gushing through the walls and threatening to ruin the priceless antiques inside.

Jazz nodded, already mentally preparing himself for the challenge ahead. "Alright, I'm on it," he said, before ending the call and grabbing his trusty toolbox. Little did he know that this was just the beginning of a day that would test his skills as a plumber – and push him to confront some secrets from Ravenswood's troubled past.
