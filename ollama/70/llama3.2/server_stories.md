As the sun set over the bustling streets of Tokyo's Shibuya ward, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded intersection of Harajuku and Meiji-dori, Emiko Nakahara wiped down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time that evening at her family's small izakaya. The smell of sake and sizzling yakitori wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of conversation and clinking glasses from the rowdy groups of patrons.
