Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Emilia "Mia" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment building, her worn denim jacket clinging to her like a second skin. The neon lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the concrete. Mia took a deep breath, the damp air filling her lungs as she made her way down the walkway to her trusty old van, Bertha.

As an electrician with her own small business, "Mia's Wiring Co.", she was no stranger to Seattle's rain-soaked streets and the occasional power outage that came with it. But tonight felt different – a sense of restlessness had been building in Mia for weeks, ever since she'd received a mysterious letter from an old flame, Dr. Ethan Patel.

The two had met during her college days at the University of Washington, bonding over their shared love of science and music. Ethan was smart and charming, but also guarded, with a reputation among his peers as being quietly intense and brilliant. After graduation, he'd gone on to earn his medical degree and start practicing medicine in Seattle. Mia had assumed he'd left the city for good, pursuing a lucrative career elsewhere.

But now, seven years later, Ethan's letter arrived at her doorstep, inviting her to meet him at an old warehouse on the waterfront. The cryptic message had only mentioned that it was time they "talked business" – but Mia couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just a casual catch-up.
