Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving on Wednesdays, but for Emilia "Mia" Rodriguez, the gloomy weather was just another reminder that she had a deadline to meet. As a investigative reporter for the Emerald City Chronicle, Mia spent most of her days digging through dusty files and interviewing sources in the city's underbelly.

Mia stood outside the crumbling apartment building on 15th Avenue, her eyes fixed on the faded neon sign that creaked in the wind. The building had been a Seattle staple for decades, but it had seen better days. The Chronicle had recently received a tip about a local non-profit organization operating out of the complex, and Mia's editor had tasked her with getting to the bottom of the story.

As she waited for her source to arrive, Mia checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time. She was supposed to meet Juan Hernandez at 2 PM sharp, but so far, there was no sign of him. The phone in her pocket buzzed with a text from an unknown number: "Trust no one."
