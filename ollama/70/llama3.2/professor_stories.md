Here's a potential story opening:

The dimly lit streets of Edinburgh were always at their most unforgiving at dawn, when the fog rolled in off the Firth of Forth like a damp shroud. It was a time of day that Dr. Emilia Sophia Patel avoided, but it was also a time that had brought her to this particular doorstep.
