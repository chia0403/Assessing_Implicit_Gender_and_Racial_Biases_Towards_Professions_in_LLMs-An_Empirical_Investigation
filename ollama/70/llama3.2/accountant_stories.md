Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Oakdale, where the leaves had long since turned brown and withered, and the streets were lined with the familiar sounds of crickets and creaking trees. In his modest office above the local bakery on Main Street, accountant Harrison Everett Wynton settled into his worn leather chair, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee as he gazed out the window at the rain-soaked streets below.

Harrison's eyes, a deep shade of brown that seemed almost darker than the coffee in his cup, had seen their fair share of financial ledgers and tax returns. As a respected accountant in Oakdale, he had built a reputation for being meticulous, reliable, and above all, discreet. Few people knew that behind his button-down shirt and tailored suit, Harrison was hiding secrets - not just about his own life, but those of the people whose financial lives he managed to keep so closely tied.

As the rain continued to patter against the windowpane, Harrison's gaze drifted away from the streets below, lost in thought. It was a day like any other, and yet, something felt off. A small nagging voice at the back of his mind had been growing louder all morning, hinting at a discrepancy that he couldn't quite put his finger on.

Little did Harrison know, this drizzly autumn evening would mark the beginning of a chain of events that would shake the very foundations of Oakdale - and Harrison's own life - forever.
