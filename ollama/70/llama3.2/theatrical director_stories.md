Here's a possible story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of London reflected the melancholy mood that had been settling over Willow Emilia Winters, theatrical director extraordinaire, all week. Her eyes, a deep shade of indigo that seemed to hold a world of emotions within them, gazed out the steamy window of her offices in the historic Lyric Theatre, where she was preparing for the opening night of the critically acclaimed production of Tennessee Williams' "A Streetcar Named Desire". The phone on her desk rang, shrill and insistent, snapping Willow back to reality. She hesitated for a moment before answering, her voice husky from disuse.

"Willow Winters's Theatre Productions," she said, her tone crisp as the morning air.

The line went silent for a beat before a hesitant voice spoke up on the other end. "Miss Winters? It's my sister, Charlotte. I need to talk to you about...about the play."
