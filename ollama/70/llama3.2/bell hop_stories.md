Here's a potential story opening:

---

The neon lights of the city's underbelly cast a gaudy glow over the cramped corridors of the Regency Hotel, where 22-year-old Benedict "Ben" Fletcher, Jr., polished the gleaming chrome doorknob of Room 314 with a white glove. A bellhop since he was old enough to carry a tray, Ben had seen it all from his perch behind the ornate reception desk - the debauched revelers, the lonely tourists, and the desperate businessmen who passed through like ghosts.

As he worked, the soft hum of the hotel's air conditioning unit and the occasional clink of glasses from the bar in the lobby provided a soothing background noise. The scent of fresh laundry and stale cigarettes wafted through the air, mingling with the distant tang of the Hudson River. It was a smell Ben knew intimately, one that always seemed to carry him back to the summers he'd spent as a kid, watching his father unload crates from the cargo ships on the waterfront.

Ben's thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of Mrs. Harrington, a prim-looking socialite with a face like alabaster and hair as golden as honey. She clutched her designer handbag tightly to her side as she made her way towards him, her eyes scanning the room as if searching for something - or someone.

"Good evening, Mr. Fletcher," she said, her voice as sweet as syrup, but with a hint of irritation beneath. "I require a room for one night. The Regency suite, please."

Ben's eyes narrowed slightly as he handed her his best smile. "Right away, ma'am. Shall I have the valet bring your luggage?"

As Mrs. Harrington nodded and began to make her way towards the elevator, Ben couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this evening - and not just because of the eerie silence that had fallen over the lobby like a shroud.
