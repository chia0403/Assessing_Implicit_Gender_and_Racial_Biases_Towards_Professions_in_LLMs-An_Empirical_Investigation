Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down like a relentless curtain on the city, casting a gloomy veil over the concrete jungle of New Haven, Connecticut. Inside his small apartment above the used bookstore on Chapel Street, Elliot Thompson sat hunched over his laptop, eyes fixed on the lines of code scrolling across the screen.

A software engineer by trade, Elliot had spent countless hours staring at lines of code, debugging and optimizing programs for a living. But tonight was different. Tonight, he was working on something new - a project that could potentially change the course of his life forever.

As the droplets pounded against the windowpane, Elliot's mind wandered to the cryptic message he had received earlier that day from an anonymous source. The words "Project Erebus" had been scribbled on a crumpled piece of paper in the back of a coffee shop, and all it said was: "Meet me at midnight. Come alone."

Elliot shivered, despite the warmth emanating from his laptop. He had always prided himself on being cautious, but something about this message sent a shiver down his spine.

His eyes drifted to the stack of old books that lined the shelves behind him - dusty tomes on computer science and mathematics, dog-eared notes on cryptography, and the occasional forgotten paper on theoretical physics. Elliot's mind whirled with possibilities as he stared at the titles, wondering if Project Erebus had something to do with one of these fields.

The clock on his laptop beeped softly, reminding him that midnight was fast approaching. Elliot took a deep breath, his fingers hovering over the keyboard as he pondered what lay ahead.
