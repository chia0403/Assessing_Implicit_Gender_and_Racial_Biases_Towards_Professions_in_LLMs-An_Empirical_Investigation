Here's a potential story opening:

Detective Ethan Alexander "Hank" Thompson stood at the edge of the rain-soaked rooftop, gazing out over the darkening cityscape of Ashwood, Oregon. The misty veil of the Willamette Valley hung heavy in the air, shrouding the streets and alleys below in a damp, grey haze.

It was 9:45 PM on a Wednesday evening, and the only sound was the distant hum of the highway and the occasional hoot of an owl. Hank's eyes, narrowed against the wind, scanned the rooftops, searching for any sign of movement or disturbance. The precinct's radio crackled to life, but all he heard was static.

Just another night in Ashwood, where the rain never seemed to wash away the secrets and lies that lurked in every shadow. Hank had been a cop for over a decade, and he knew better than to believe that the darkness was ever truly washed clean.

As he stood there, his mind wandered back to the case that had brought him here tonight: the murder of 25-year-old Lily Martin, a talented young artist whose body had been found in an alleyway just a block away from this very rooftop. The killer had left no signs of forced entry or struggle, just a single message scrawled on the wall in crimson ink: "You'll never find me."

Hank's gut told him that this was more than just a random act of violence. There was something personal at play here, something that spoke to the darkest corners of Ashwood's soul.

And now, with every passing minute, Hank felt the weight of that case bearing down on him like a physical force. He knew he needed to find Lily's killer before they struck again, but as he gazed out into the darkness, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was staring straight into the face of evil itself.
