Here's a story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling animal shelter where 25-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson worked as an animal caretaker. Lexi had always been passionate about animals, and after completing her degree in veterinary technology, she landed a job at the shelter, where she spent her days caring for dogs, cats, and everything in between.

The shelter was a cozy facility nestled in the heart of town, surrounded by tall oak trees and a lush green lawn. The building itself was old, with peeling paint and worn wooden floors, but it had a charming character that made Lexi feel right at home. As she locked up the shelter at the end of her shift, Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the stress of the day melt away. She loved her job, but it could be emotionally draining, especially when dealing with animals that were in dire need of care.

As she walked back to her small apartment above the shelter's office, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had been noticing strange occurrences around the shelter lately - equipment malfunctioning, food and supplies going missing, and an eerie sense of unease among the staff. It wasn't until now, as she was walking down the sidewalk, that Lexi realized why: a cryptic message scrawled on the whiteboard outside the shelter's main office caught her eye.

"Meet me at midnight," it read. "Come alone."

Lexi's heart skipped a beat as she wondered who could have written the message and what they wanted with her. Little did she know, this mysterious encounter would set off a chain of events that would change her life forever.
