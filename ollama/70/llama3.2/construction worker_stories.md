Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and worn brick buildings that lined them. In a small, weathered trailer on the outskirts of town, 35-year-old Jesse Ryder sat hunched over his workbench, a stained steel cup of lukewarm coffee in one hand and a socket wrench in the other.

A former Army mechanic turned construction worker, Jesse had spent the past five years laboring for the big-box contractor, Hawkins Builders, who seemed to be the only game in town when it came to building new homes and renovating old ones. His latest project, a pair of identical suburban McMansions on Elm Street, was due to be finished tomorrow - but as he tinkered with the engine of his trusty Ford F-150, Jesse couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The air was thick with an eerie silence, broken only by the distant hum of the highway and the occasional hoot of a lonely owl perched in a nearby tree. The trailer's flimsy walls seemed to vibrate with the low rumbles of engines in the distance, but despite the din, Jesse felt a growing sense of unease that had nothing to do with the work he did or the money he earned.

It was just a feeling - a nagging sense that something in his life wasn't quite right. And as he wiped the sweat from his forehead and set the wrench aside, Jesse couldn't help but wonder what that something might be.
