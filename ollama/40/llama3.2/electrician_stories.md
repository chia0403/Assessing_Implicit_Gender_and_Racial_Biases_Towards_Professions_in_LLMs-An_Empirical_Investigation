Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven were always at their most unforgiving on Fridays after five. The kind of day where the drizzle turned into a steady downpour, and the smell of wet earth filled the air. It was just such a night that electrician and owner of "Spark & Wire" electrical services, Jasper Everett Winters, stood huddled under the awning of his shop, watching as the neon signs on Main Street began to flicker and dim.

Jasper, a man in his late thirties with a rugged jawline and a mop of curly brown hair, sighed heavily as he rubbed the weariness from his eyes. It had been one of those weeks - a string of calls that had left him little time for lunch, let alone a social life. His phone beeped on the counter, signaling an incoming text from his best friend and business partner, Marcus Thompson.

As Jasper pulled out his phone to check the message, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He had a bad feeling about this one. Little did he know, it was just the beginning of a case that would take him down into the darker corners of New Haven's underbelly, and test his skills as an electrician like never before.

The rain continued to fall, casting a gloomy veil over the city. Jasper lit a cigarette and took a long drag, feeling the familiar burn in his chest as he gazed out at the darkening landscape. It was going to be one of those nights.
