Here's a potential story opening and setting:

A 6:00 AM meeting at the law firm where she worked had awakened her to the drizzly morning, and now she was already running late.

Lexi quickened her pace, her eyes fixed on the gleaming glass façade of her office building, just a few blocks away from Pike Place Market. The sound of seagulls crying overhead mingled with the hum of traffic as she made her way through the crowded streets. It was going to be one of those days.

Lexi was a paralegal with a keen eye for detail and a knack for navigating the complex web of Seattle's legal system. With years of experience under her belt, she had earned the respect of her colleagues at Jenkins & Associates, one of the city's top law firms. But despite her impressive credentials, Lexi couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off – a nagging sense of unease that lingered in the back of her mind like an unspoken warning.

Little did she know, today would be the day when everything changed forever...
