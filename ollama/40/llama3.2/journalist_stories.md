The rain-soaked streets of Tokyo gleamed like polished onyx as Emiko Matsumoto stepped out of her office building, camera slung over her shoulder and notebook clutched in her hand. As a investigative journalist for the prestigious Tokyo Daily Times, Emiko had made a name for herself by sniffing out corruption and uncovering hidden truths.
