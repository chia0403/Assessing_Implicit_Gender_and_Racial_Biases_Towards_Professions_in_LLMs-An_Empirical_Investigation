Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy shadow over the worn concrete buildings that lined Elm Street. Inside the small office building at 345 Main St., a lone figure hunched over a cluttered desk, her eyes fixed on the rows of yellowed paperwork and dusty files that seemed to stretch on forever.

This was where Emily Mae Wilson spent most of her days - typing away on her old IBM Selectric, trying to keep up with the never-ending stream of memos and meeting requests that poured in from the executives who thought they knew better than she did. It was a job that required patience, dedication, and a healthy dose of skepticism.

At 32 years old, Emily had been the secretary at Harrison & Co. for five years, long enough to know all the quirks of the building's temperamental elevator, the best way to get a decent cup of coffee from the vending machine, and how to politely extricate herself from the awkward small talk that seemed to be an inevitable part of office life.

But as she worked through her morning routine, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The CEO's voice on the intercom sounded more sinister than usual, and the way the fluorescent lights overhead seemed to flicker with a malevolent energy made her skin crawl.

It was just another typical Monday morning at Harrison & Co., but for some reason, Emily felt like she was walking into a storm that would change everything.
