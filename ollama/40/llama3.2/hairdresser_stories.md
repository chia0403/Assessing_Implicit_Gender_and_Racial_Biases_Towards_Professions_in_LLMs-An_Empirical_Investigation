Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the small coastal town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint shops and cafes that lined its Main Street. The smell of saltwater and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of seagulls crying overhead.

In the heart of this charming town square stood "Tidal Waves," a bustling hair salon where 28-year-old Ava Elizabeth Waters worked her magic. A talented and fiercely independent hairstylist, Ava had built a loyal client base among the town's residents and visitors alike, who flocked to her for her expert cuts, vibrant colors, and warm, listening ear.

As she swept up the last of the day's hair clippings into a trash can, Ava gazed out the salon's large windows at the sea of people strolling along the beach. She felt a sense of contentment wash over her - this was her happy place, where she could escape the stresses of everyday life and lose herself in the art of transformation.

Little did Ava know, however, that tonight would bring more than just the usual evening rush of clients. Tonight, it would be the night that changed everything.
