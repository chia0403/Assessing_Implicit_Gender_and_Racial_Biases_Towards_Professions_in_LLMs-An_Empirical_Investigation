Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the sea, shrouding the narrow streets of Whitby in a damp, grey mist that clung to the stone walls like a damp cloth. In a small, cluttered studio above the seaside town's oldest bookstore, artist Emilia Fothergill stirred in her bed, tossing aside the tangled sheets and swinging her legs over the side of the rickety wooden frame.

The faint scent of turpentine and linseed oil wafted through the air, mingling with the salty tang of the sea that seeped into every corner of Emilia's life. As she stood up, the creaking of her joints echoed off the brick walls as she stretched, her long fingers flexing like a cat's as she arched her back.

Today was the day she'd been waiting for – the day she'd finally have a chance to finish the piece that had been haunting her imagination for months.
