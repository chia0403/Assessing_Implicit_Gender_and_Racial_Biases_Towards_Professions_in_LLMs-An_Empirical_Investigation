Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emily Rose Thompson, a successful dentist with a kind smile and a passion for restorative dentistry, stood at the edge of her office building, gazing out at the bustling streets of downtown Seattle. The sound of raindrops pattering against her umbrella provided a soothing background hum as she contemplated another long day ahead.

As she peered into the misty morning air, Emily's eyes lingered on the sleek glass façade of the adjacent office complex, where the prestigious Northwest Dental Institute had its headquarters. It was a fitting irony that one of the most respected dental institutions in the country should be located so close to her own modest practice, Thompson Dental Care.

With over a decade of experience under her belt, Emily had built a loyal patient base and earned a reputation for her gentle touch, creative solutions, and commitment to excellence. But despite her professional success, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing – a sense of purpose, perhaps, or a hint of excitement that came with exploring new horizons.

As she turned to head back into the rain-soaked streets, Emily's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of her phone buzzing in her pocket. A text from an unknown number read: "Meet me at the old coffee shop on 1st and Pike at 2 PM. Come alone."
