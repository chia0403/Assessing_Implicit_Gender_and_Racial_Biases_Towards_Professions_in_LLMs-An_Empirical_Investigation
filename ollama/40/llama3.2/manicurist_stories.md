Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set over the bustling streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded alleys and neon-lit billboards. In a small, unassuming salon tucked away on a side street, 25-year-old Emiko Nakahara was busy prepping for another night of pampering her clients.

Emiko, or "Miki" as she was known to her friends and regulars, had spent the past five years honing her craft as a skilled manicurist at Tokyo's prestigious Golden Touch salon. With a delicate touch and an eye for detail, Miki had built a loyal following among Tokyo's fashionistas and celebrities, who raved about her ability to transform even the most basic of nail art designs into works of art.

As she expertly applied a coat of rich berry polish to a client's short nails, Miki's mind began to wander to the strange letter she had received earlier that day. It was an unsigned note with no return address, but its cryptic message had sent a shiver down her spine: "Your past is about to catch up with you. Meet me at the old tea house on Omoide Yokocho at midnight if you want to know the truth."

Miki's heart skipped a beat as she carefully set aside the polish and turned back to face her client, trying to appear nonchalant despite the growing sense of unease that had settled in the pit of her stomach. Little did she know, this mysterious message was only the beginning of a journey that would take her down a path of secrets, lies, and unexpected revelations about her own past...
