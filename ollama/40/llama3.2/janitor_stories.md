Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the deserted corridors of Ravenswood High School, the once-thriving institution now a shadow of its former self. The year was 1985, and the Cold War era loomed large, casting a sense of unease over even the most mundane aspects of life.

In a corner of the school where the fluorescent lights seemed to hum in discordant harmony with each other, janitor Amos Everett Wystan trudged through the darkness, his worn-out sneakers making soft squeaks on the linoleum floor. A gruff but kind-hearted man in his late 40s, Amos had spent decades cleaning up after the students and faculty who had once populated these halls.

As he swept and mopped with a practiced efficiency, Amos's thoughts turned to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the school lately. Equipment would go missing or turn up broken, and some of the teachers reported hearing disembodied whispers in their classrooms at night. The students seemed particularly spooked, always whispering to each other about ghostly apparitions and cursed hallways.

Amos didn't put much stock in such rumors – he was a practical man, after all – but he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. And as he pushed open the creaky door to the school's boiler room, a chill ran down his spine that had nothing to do with the cold winter air outside.

The dimly lit room was musty and still, the only sound the gentle hum of machinery and Amos's own ragged breathing. As his eyes adjusted to the darkness, he noticed something peculiar – a piece of paper taped to the wall, its surface covered in cryptic symbols that seemed to shift and writhe like living things.

Amos's heart quickened as he reached for the tape, his fingers trembling with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. What was this message trying to tell him? And who – or what – had left it here, in the depths of the school where few people dared to tread?
