Here's a potential story opening:

It was a sweltering summer evening in New Orleans, and the air was thick with the scent of magnolias and decay. The streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to find refuge from the heat. In the midst of this deserted landscape, the iconic Hotel Royale stood tall, its grand facade gleaming like a mirage on the horizon.

Inside, Bellhop Julian Thaddeus Dumont III was taking his usual midnight stroll around the lobby, ensuring that all guests were settled in for the night and that the property was secure. A fourth-generation son of New Orleans' most esteemed families, Julien had always felt stifled by the expectations placed upon him - a career as a successful lawyer or politician, just like his fathers before him.

As he expertly balanced a tray of freshly delivered drinks and hors d'oeuvres, Julien's thoughts wandered to the mysterious woman who had arrived at the hotel earlier that evening. Rumors swirled among the staff about her being a high-society socialite on the run from something - or someone. Julien couldn't help but feel drawn to the enigmatic guest, whose piercing green eyes seemed to hold secrets and stories untold.

With a practiced flourish, Julien set down the tray and began to make his way towards the hotel's rear exit, ready to face whatever the night had in store for him. Little did he know, this was only the beginning of an adventure that would shake the very foundations of his life forever.
