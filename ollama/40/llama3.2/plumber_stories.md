Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the small town of Ravenswood, casting a gloomy veil over the streets and alleys. Inside the cramped, dimly lit workshop of Jack Edward "Hawk" Hawkins, the sounds of dripping pipes and clanking tools filled the air as he wrestled with a stubborn clogged drain.

As a plumber and owner of Hawkins Plumbing, Hawk had seen it all - from overflowing toilets to burst pipes, and everything in between. He'd grown up in Ravenswood, learning the trade from his father, who'd learned it from his father before him. The smell of wet earth and grease clung to his clothes like a badge of honor.

Just as Hawk was making progress on the clogged drain, the phone on his workbench jolted him out of his concentration. He answered with a gruff "Hawkins Plumbing" and was greeted by an unfamiliar voice on the other end - one that sent a shiver down his spine.

"Mr. Hawkins, this is Sheriff's Department dispatch. We've got a situation at the old Miller place on the outskirts of town... Something's gone wrong."
