Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the quiet suburban streets of Oakwood, Illinois, Emily J. Thompson sat at her desk, surrounded by stacks of tax returns, financial ledgers, and dusty tomes on tax law. The fluorescent lights above flickered, casting an eerie glow over the cluttered office space that had been her home away from home for years. Outside, the leaves rustled in the autumn breeze, signaling the end of another fiscal year, but inside, Emily's mind was already racing with the upcoming deadline: April 15th.

At 32, Emily was a seasoned income tax preparer, with a reputation for being meticulous and thorough. She had built her business from scratch, working out of this small office above the diner on Main Street, and had earned a loyal clientele of local small business owners, freelancers, and individuals alike who trusted her expertise to navigate the complex web of tax codes.

Despite the monotony of her daily routine, Emily found solace in the precision and logic of tax preparation. It was a world where numbers made sense, and the rules were clear-cut – unlike the messy world outside, where people's lives were often marked by uncertainty and chaos. As she poured herself a cup of lukewarm coffee from the thermos on her desk, Emily felt a familiar sense of calm wash over her, readying her for another day of crunching numbers and sorting out the financial lives of those around her.

Little did she know, however, that this particular April 15th would bring more than just routine tax season stress – it would be a day that would change everything.
