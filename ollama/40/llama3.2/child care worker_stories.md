In a cozy little bungalow on Elm Street, 28-year-old Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson was closing up the last of her day at the Bright Beginnings Childcare Center. She had spent the past eight years working with kids from infancy to five-year-olds, watching them grow from wobbly toddlers into curious and adventurous preschoolers.

Her cat, Luna, a sleek black feline with piercing green eyes, was waiting for her on the counter, where Lexi had left a bowl of fresh milk.

Just as Lexi was about to put the kettle on for tea, her phone rang, shrill and insistent. She hesitated for a moment before answering, wondering who could be calling at such a late hour. Little did she know that this call would change everything...
