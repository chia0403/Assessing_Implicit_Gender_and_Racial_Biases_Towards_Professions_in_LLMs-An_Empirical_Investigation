Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Portland, Oregon, and journalist Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood outside the crumbling Victorian mansion on Hawthorne Boulevard, her camera slung over her shoulder and her notebook at the ready. The once-grand house had been abandoned for years, its ornate ironwork gates creaking in the wind as if warning passersby to turn back.

Lexi, a 30-year-old investigative reporter with a keen mind and an even keener nose for scandal, had been tracking rumors of paranormal activity within the mansion's walls for months. Tonight, she was finally here, determined to get to the bottom of the whispers that had drawn her in like a moth to a flame.

As she pushed open the creaking front gate, Lexi felt a shiver run down her spine. Something about this place didn't feel right. The air seemed heavy with secrets, and she could almost smell the scent of decay wafting from within. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for what lay ahead.

And then, just as she was about to step inside, Lexi's phone buzzed in her pocket. A text message from an unknown number: "Don't go in there."
