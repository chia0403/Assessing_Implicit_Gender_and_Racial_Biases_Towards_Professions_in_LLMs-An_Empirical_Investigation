Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, casting a warm orange glow over the vast open lands. Jack Edward McCann, a rugged 45-year-old heavy equipment operator with a thick beard and weathered skin, climbed into his trusty Caterpillar 797F mining truck, affectionately nicknamed "Bertha." He had spent countless hours operating Bertha in these same deserts of Arizona, extracting coal from the depths of the Superstition Mountains. As he started the engine and began to back out of the dusty parking lot of the old mine, Jack's mind wandered back to his phone call with his estranged wife just that morning - she had left him a cryptic message saying she was coming home, after years of living in California.

The old mine loomed before him, its crumbling walls and rusting machinery a testament to better days. Bertha rumbled to life as Jack shifted into gear, the wheels crunching on the gravel as he made his way back into the darkness of the abandoned mine shafts. It was a place where Jack had found both solace and terror - a reminder that even in the harshest environments, there was always something waiting just beneath the surface.
