The fluorescent lights buzzed like angry wasps trapped in a steel cage, their pale glow illuminating dust motes swirling lazily in the stagnant air of the Grand Metropolitan Library.  A perpetual silence reigned inside, broken only by the faint rustling of pages from somewhere deep within the towering stacks. This was the domain of Arthur Finch, the humble janitor who kept this monument to knowledge, and indeed, human sanity, functioning during its weekly hibernation. 

Arthur's worn rubber boots echoed as he navigated the labyrinthine corridors, his mop handle a familiar extension of himself. He paused at the grand library entrance, gazing upon its towering columns adorned with intricate carvings, each symbol whispering tales of forgotten worlds and lost civilizations. He sighed; it wasn’t just dust and silence that were the hallmarks of this place; it was also a history he felt strangely connected to – one born from countless stories whispered between worn pages and rustling papers. Arthur Finch, the janitor, was but a humble witness to the grand saga of time unfolding within these walls.
