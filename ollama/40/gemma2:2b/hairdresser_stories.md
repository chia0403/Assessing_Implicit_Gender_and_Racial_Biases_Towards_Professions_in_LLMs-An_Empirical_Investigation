## Story Opening

The rhythmic snip-snap of the shears was like a heartbeat to Esmeralda "Esme" Bellatrix. It was her rhythm, her solace, her lifeblood. For twenty years, she'd wielded that silver blade with artistry and confidence in her cozy salon nestled on Sycamore Street, The Strand of Secrets.  The air was thick with the scent of lavender hairspray and rosemary shampoo, a comforting blend of familiar chaos.

Esme’s canvas was a kaleidoscope of colors and textures. Today’s challenge was Ms. Delancy, the silver-haired matriarch who insisted on keeping her mane "like a raven's wing," a task Esme knew would require more than a mere trim. It was Ms. Delancy’s birthday, and Esme had promised to bring her back from the brink of a disastrously dull do that she felt like a seasoned magician might conjure from thin air.
