The fluorescent hum of the server farm was the only music Ethan knew.  It wasn't just an echo through the sterile steel halls; it was his lullaby, the metronome to his pulse as he hacked away at lines of code on a keyboard that felt worn and familiar under his fingertips. "Ethan Blackwood," he mumbled, almost whispering the name aloud like a prayer, before returning his focus to the screen.  

His tiny apartment, nestled above a bustling Italian restaurant in San Francisco's Mission District, was a world away from the sprawling data centers and interconnected networks that Ethan knew and loved so intimately. The aroma of garlic bread lingered in the air despite Ethan's meticulous efforts to keep his lab pristine; the city's symphony played on outside his window: sirens blending with laughter from a nearby bar. Tonight, though, he needed silence.  The code was tangled, a knotted mess like the vines that strangled the ancient oak tree at the back of his building. He had to untangle it before tomorrow’s deadline – and maybe unravel something deeper.
