The scent of acetone and lavender hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Esmeralda “Esme” Thorne as she meticulously filed down Mrs. Peterson's brittle acrylic nails. The small salon was tucked away in a quiet corner of the bustling city, an oasis amidst concrete and chaos. Rain hammered against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of a nearby diner into streaks of purple and green. Esme closed her eyes for a moment, savoring the rhythmic rasp of her tools, then glanced at Mrs. Peterson's weathered hands, once so graceful, now adorned with chipped nail polish and years of work. 

"You know," Mrs. Peterson began, her voice raspy and dry like aged parchment, "every time I see your nails, I think of the woman who built this city – that strong, fearless spirit." Esme paused, her brow furrowing as she looked at the chipped lavender polish on Mrs. Peterson's thumb.  "But even the strongest souls need a little love," she murmured under her breath.
