Rain pattered against the grimy windowpanes of The Salty Siren, each drop like a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of the storm. Inside, the air was thick with cigarette smoke and the scent of stale ale - an intoxicating blend that masked any hint of the ocean breeze just outside. Behind the worn oak bar sat Amelia "Amy" Thorne, her hands calloused but deft as she expertly poured a jigger of amber whiskey into a glass. 

Amy had been slinging drinks at The Siren for nearly five years now, witnessing every kind of storm â€“ not just the weather one that raged outside these walls, but also the ones brewing inside her clientele. There was no escaping the raw emotions spilled on bartops; tales of unrequited love and betrayals whispered between sips of gin and tonic, anxieties voiced in a hushed tone over shots of rye. Amy had learned to listen with her heart as much as her ears. This lonely corner of the world felt more like home than anywhere else, a place where secrets found solace amidst the raindrops.
