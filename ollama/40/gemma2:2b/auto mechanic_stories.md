The air hung thick with grease and burnt oil as Elias "Elroy" Jackson wrestled with the sputtering engine of Mr. Henderson's vintage 1965 Mustang. The sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the cluttered garage that smelled faintly of gasoline and forgotten dreams. Elroy sighed, the rasping sound echoing through the cavernous space. Years of working on old engines had left their mark – wrinkles around his eyes, grease smudged under his fingernails, a faint tremor in his hands.  

Elroy's world was the symphony of metal clangs and hissing exhaust pipes, a world he felt most at home in. The hum of the garage’s lone fluorescent bulb provided an uneven light show over the engine, illuminating the intricate web of wires and hoses with fleeting bursts of illumination. Outside, the sleepy town of Harmony Creek seemed to sigh along with the Mustang's dying cough. 

But tonight, even the symphony faltered.  Something was wrong. The problem wasn't just a blown gasket or a faulty spark plug; it was something deeper, something that clung to Elroy like dust on a rusted engine block. He felt it in his gut, an unwelcome prickle of fear amidst the usual anxieties that came with fixing broken dreams.
