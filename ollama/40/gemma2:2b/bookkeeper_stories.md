The rain hammered against the windowpane, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the otherwise silent office.  Amelia Sterling, her glasses perched precariously on her nose, hunched over the ledger, its worn pages sighing with the weight of every transaction she processed. The aroma of old paper and stale coffee filled the air as the rain swirled outside, blurring the faint streetlights that illuminated the quaint corner shop. 

Across the room, a single ray of sunlight filtered through a dusty windowpane, illuminating a faded floral pattern on a worn-out armchair tucked under the desk. Amelia often found solace in these quiet moments, lost in the labyrinthine world of numbers and the comforting routine of her work – a life she'd built for herself after years spent battling against societal expectations.  She was content, in her own way, with the predictability and order of her routine. 

However, tonight, a different kind of tension throbbed beneath the surface. The ledger was missing an entry - a vital detail that had slipped into oblivion. A shiver went down Amelia's spine, the weight of the unknown feeling oppressive. As the rain intensified outside, it echoed the growing unease within her – a disquiet she knew could only be explained by one thing: something wasn't right.
