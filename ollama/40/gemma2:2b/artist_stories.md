## Setting:

The year is 1927, and the world shimmers with a newfound optimism after the Great War's ending. A vibrant jazz soundtrack fills the air as you walk down the cobbled streets of Montmartre, Paris.  Bright hues of bougainvillea spill over wrought-iron balconies, while children laugh, their tiny hands clutched tightly around brightly colored balloons. 

**Name:**  AÃ«llie Delacroix, known to all simply as "Elle". 

 **Story Opening:**

Elle's paintbrush danced across the canvas, leaving a trail of swirling strokes and bold color across her studio. Outside, the laughter of children echoed into the small attic space, but Elle found no joy in their innocent revelry. The world felt too bright, too hopeful.  Her gaze drifted to the unfinished masterpiece on her easel: a haunting portrait of a woman with hollow eyes.

She picked up a chipped brush, its bristles rough against her fingertips, and dipped it into a pool of cobalt blue paint, swirling it over and over until the hues bled into one another. "Too much," she muttered to herself, her voice swallowed by the cacophony of Parisian life outside. The woman in the painting seemed to stare back at her, an echo of her own struggle against the relentless tide of light, the very essence of joy that was making it so hard for her to find a single note of despair in all this beauty.  Her canvas held a secret: one she yearned to unlock but feared might shatter the fragile world she had built.

* Or will she retreat into her self-imposed solitude, losing herself in the labyrinth of her soul?
