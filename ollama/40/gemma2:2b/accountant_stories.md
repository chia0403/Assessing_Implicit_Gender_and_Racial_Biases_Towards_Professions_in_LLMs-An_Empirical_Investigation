The rhythmic clatter of keys on old IBM Model M keyboard was Amelia Croft's soundtrack.  Her cramped office in Chicago felt more like an escape pod than an accounting practice, thanks to the relentless drone of traffic outside and the symphony of fluorescent lights buzzing overhead. It was 10:37 pm on a Tuesday night, which meant she was already three hours past her typical deadline for tax season. Amelia's weary eyes scanned over another batch of invoices, each one a tiny paper brick in the towering wall of unpaid bills threatening to crumble her composure.  She rubbed her temples and sighed. 

Chicago's winters were harsh, but even the biting winds couldn't compare to the icy chill creeping into Amelia’s soul as she looked at the pile of overdue invoices. She was supposed to be a champion for financial stability, yet here she was, drowning in a sea of unorganized chaos, her heart echoing with the same desperation that plagued the struggling businesses on her client list.  The only thing that kept Amelia afloat was the familiar routine of balancing ledgers and calculating profits – her quiet rebellion against the chaotic world beyond. But tonight, as the night stretched further than she could bear, it felt like a fight lost before it began.
