The air in the salon hung thick with the perfume of hairspray and apprehension. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of "Glamora," a small but cozy shop nestled on a quiet side street in New Orleans.

Not just any storm, but one conjured by the weight of expectations and an avalanche of last-minute requests for a special event that had her feeling anything but glamorous.
