The late afternoon sun slanted through the stained glass windows of Hawthorne Elementary, painting the linoleum floor in hues of amber and rose. Inside, Dr. Eleanor Hayes adjusted her glasses and leaned back in her chair, the familiar scent of disinfectant and crayons swirling around her like an invisible embrace. She was used to this scene – a kaleidoscope of first-day jitters, whispered anxieties, and playground disputes - all meticulously catalogued in the silent depths of her mind. 

Dr. Hayes’ day began just as it did every week: sorting through the tangled web of reports, charting progress on individual student needs, and waiting for the inevitable outburst from Mrs. Peterson, the notoriously fiery kindergarten teacher who often accused Dr. Hayes of fostering “rebellious behavior” in her little charges. But today was different. Today, Eleanor’s attention was drawn not to a sea of faces but to one boy standing at the edge of the playground, his silhouette stark against the setting sun. His name, she knew from the file, was Ethan Miller.  He stood with an air of quiet melancholy that felt out of place in the vibrant chaos of her classroom. He looked as though he could disappear into the shadows.
