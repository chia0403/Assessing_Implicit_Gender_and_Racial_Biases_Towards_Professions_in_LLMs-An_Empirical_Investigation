Rain hammered on the rusted tin roof of Amelia "Amy" Crane's studio, each drop an echoing drumbeat against the muted symphony of wind howling outside.  Smoke curled from her chimney like wispy, melancholy ghosts. Amy stared out onto the deserted street, her camera's flash illuminating the worn brick buildings, their storefronts boarded up and faded with years of neglect. This was no ordinary city; this was Havenwood - a place where time seemed to have stopped breathing, leaving only dust and memories in its wake. 

Amy wasn't from Havenwood. She’d moved here after her grandmother passed away, drawn by the stories she'd been told about her life before the world shifted gears.  Her grandmother had left behind a trove of old photographs – faded snapshots of bustling streets, laughing children, and stoic faces framed against vibrant landscapes. Amy spent years studying them, piecing together their narrative as if she were a detective solving a centuries-old puzzle. 

But now, with the storm raging outside her studio door,  she found herself staring not at photographs, but at real places. Places that seemed to hold echoes of the lives that had been lived and lost in Havenwood. The silence was heavy, almost suffocating. It was as if the very air held its breath, waiting for a story to unfold.
