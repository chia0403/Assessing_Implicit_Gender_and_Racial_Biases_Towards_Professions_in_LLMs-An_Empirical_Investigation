The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel, each one shifting like phantoms in the dusty air.  "Good morning," rasped Theodore "Teddy" Hawthorne as he leaned against the worn oak desk, his oversized, floral-patterned coat spilling over him like a spilled inkwell.  The late December chill was biting, but Teddy didn't mind, for the warmth inside the hotel was a comforting furnace compared to the icy gusts that howled outside. His nimble fingers adjusted a misplaced collar on Mr. Fitzwilliamâ€™s suit jacket - another one of those rich men from upstate whose lives were so much more complicated than his own. 

Teddy took a drag from his cigarette, the smoke swirling before him like miniature whirlwinds. The Grand Majestic was a monument to forgotten glamour and faded charm, its opulent interior struggling against the creeping tide of modernity.  Outside, snow began to fall in earnest, shrouding the world in a silent blanket of white. It was the kind of day that whispered tales of long-gone loves and hidden fortunes.  Teddy, however, felt strangely adrift; his life was a series of repetitive motions - luggage check, coffee delivery, bell ringing - punctuated by fleeting moments of boredom and longing. He yearned for something more than this monotonous routine. Something beyond the velvet curtains and the endless stream of rich men who came and went like transient phantoms, their stories as fleeting as the dust motes dancing in the gaslight glow.
