The rain hammered down on Rusty's Transit van like someone was beating it with an oversized rubber mallet.  Inside, the only sound louder than the torrent outside was his ragged breaths as he wrestled with the stubborn faucet in Mrs. Henderson's kitchen. The air was thick with the scent of stale tea and mildew – a potent cocktail that clung to even the most freshly-cleaned surfaces in this house that had seen better days.  

His name was **Reginald "Rusty" Carter**, and despite his nickname, he was anything but rusty. At 38, his hands were calloused and strong, his brow furrowed with years of fixing stubborn clogs and unclogging even more stubborn emotions. He knew Mrs. Henderson's story - a life of hardship and regret, punctuated by the occasional burst of light in the form of her two adopted granddaughters. But even with their smiles as wide as a ten-foot ladder, he couldn’t shake off the feeling that this leaky faucet was just another obstacle on his already-challenging route through life's plumbing system.  
 

**Setting:**  The quaint and forgotten town of Oakhaven, nestled in the heart of Appalachian valleys. The year is 1987. The town boasts a population of around five hundred, a majority of whom are farmers with hands calloused by years of toil. The air is thick with humidity and the sounds of cicadas, crickets chirping their evening song under a sky painted in shades of bruised purple and grey.
