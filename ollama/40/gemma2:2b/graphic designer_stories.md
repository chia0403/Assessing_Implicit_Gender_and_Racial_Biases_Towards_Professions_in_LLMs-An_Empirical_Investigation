Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the Parisian skyline into a kaleidoscope of gray and silver. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Dubois hunched over her workstation, battling the onslaught of creative frustration.  A client's brief, demanding yet vague, was sprawled on the desk like a discarded canvas. The colours he wanted were "bold," but what did that even mean? 

The clock ticked relentlessly on the antique mantle clock, counting down to Amy's deadline. She took a deep breath and stared at her latest design – a series of posters promoting a new vintage clothing line, titled “Threads of Time.” Each image was meticulously crafted, each font chosen with care, yet it felt… off.  It lacked that crucial spark, the "wow" factor she craved. 

She glanced out at the storm, and for a fleeting moment, saw herself mirrored in the shimmering water droplets on the windowpane. It was like looking into her own reflection, but one layer of paint too thick, one shade darker than usual. A feeling crept through her: this wasn’t just about colour or design; it was about finding the essence of someone she'd never met before. It was about capturing a story, a soul.  Amy sighed, the frustration bubbling over. She knew exactly what she needed to do.
