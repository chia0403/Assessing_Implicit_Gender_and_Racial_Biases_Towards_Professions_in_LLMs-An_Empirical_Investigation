The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of pine needles from the towering pines surrounding Elwood's small apartment complex. A storm had been brewing for days, swirling in the distance like a bruise over the sky. Rain hammered against the flimsy metal roof of his workshop, the rhythm mimicking the anxious beat of Elwood's heart. He wasn't afraid of storms, not really. It was the flashes of lightning that sent chills crawling down his spine, each one like a silent promise of danger. 

Elwood adjusted the wrench he gripped, its familiar weight offering a semblance of control in this moment of mounting unease. His calloused fingers worked with practised ease, soldering wires together for the last time before a long weekend spent chasing ghosts of burnt circuits and faulty wiring. His toolbox was his only solace; filled with tools as well-worn as his memories. The faint glow of the streetlight outside painted his workshop in an unsettling amber light, making the shadows around him dance like phantom limbs. Tonight, the electric hum of the wires wouldn't fade away until he found the source of the persistent flicker that plagued the old building. 


Elwood was a man who felt at home with electricity;  it coursed through his veins as readily as blood. His father had been an electrician too, and Elwoodâ€™s love for the tangible power that flowed through wires was something passed down like a family heirloom. But tonight, the storm wasn't just bringing in the rain. Something else lurked in its darkness - a mystery that hummed with an electric anticipation, beckoning him to unravel it before the next bolt of lightning struck.
