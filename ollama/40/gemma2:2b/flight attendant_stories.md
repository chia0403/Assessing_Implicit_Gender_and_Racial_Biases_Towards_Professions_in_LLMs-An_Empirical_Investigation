## The Weight of Sky and Time

**Setting:**  A cramped, dimly lit galley on the tail section of an overnight transatlantic flight. 2 AM, Eastern Standard Time.  The cabin lights have dimmed to a soft blue glow, signaling the start of the slumber-inducing turbulence from hours ago. Outside, the vast canvas of night sky stretches beneath the moon's pale silver touch.

**Character:**  Amelia Rose "Amy" Lawson is a seasoned flight attendant with an air of quiet confidence that belies her 28 years. The worn leather of her apron feels familiar against her skin, comforting and grounding amidst the ever-shifting world of air travel. Tonight, she's exhausted from serving up endless cups of coffee and navigating unruly passengers during the turbulent journey across the Atlantic Ocean.

**Story Opening:**  Amy stared out the window at the blurry canvas of stars. The engine hummed a steady, rhythmic pulse, its own lullaby against the symphony of snoring passengers. She leaned back on her stool, fingers tracing the worn grooves of a travel mug she'd carried for years. A half-empty thermos of herbal tea sat in front of her. It was one of the few things that felt like normalcy, grounding her amidst the weight of sky and time. 

“Anything I can get you?” Her voice echoed against the metal walls as she addressed a slumbering man in a suit.  A faint smile touched her lips, but it held a weariness that was etched deep into every line on her face - lines that mirrored the vast expanse of the star-dusted sky beyond the window. 


What will Amy do?
