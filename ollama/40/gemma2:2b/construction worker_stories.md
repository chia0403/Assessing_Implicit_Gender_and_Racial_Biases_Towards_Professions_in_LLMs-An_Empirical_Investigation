The clang of the hammer echoed through the concrete canyons of downtown Chicago, a familiar symphony to **Caleb Thorne's** ears. The biting wind whipped around him, carrying with it the scent of exhaust fumes and distant sirens. Above him, steel skeletons rose like gothic spires, their future obscured by dust clouds and the ever-present haze of construction.  His worn leather work gloves, caked in gray grit, gripped the hammer tighter as he swung at a stubborn bolt on one of the new towers, each strike resonating with a quiet pride that only came with shaping raw materials into something tangible.

Caleb wasn't from this city. He'd moved here after the farm went bust and found himself working for "Honest Abe Construction,"  a company run by a man who spoke in hushed tones of dreams he thought would blossom into skyscrapers that touched the clouds. Caleb was just trying to find his own place, one brick at a time. 


**Setting:** Downtown Chicago, amidst the construction boom, with towering steel skeletons and a relentless wind whipping through the air.
**Main character:** Caleb Thorne, a strong-willed, solitary construction worker who finds solace in the rhythmic clang of his hammer.
