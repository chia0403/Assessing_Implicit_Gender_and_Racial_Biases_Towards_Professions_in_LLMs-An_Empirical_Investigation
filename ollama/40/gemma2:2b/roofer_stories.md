Rain hammered against the rickety tin roof above Finnigan "Finn" O'Reilly's head.  He stood on a ladder, his worn boots slick with rain, peering down at the crumbling facade of Mrs. Peabody's Victorian home. The wind howled like a tortured beast around the old structure, tearing at the peeling paint and threatening to rip off any remaining stability. 

"It’s gonna cost you somethin' to fix up this here house," Finn muttered under his breath, adjusting his worn cap.  He could almost see Mrs. Peabody's pinched face in his memory; she had been a fixture of his childhood, her home a comforting beacon of warmth and safety against the harsh edges of the world he knew. Now, years later, she was fading away, leaving behind the echoes of her kindness and a crumbling shell that threatened to collapse under its own weight.  

Finn's hands, rough from years of labor on the roof, tightened around his wrench as he began to work, the rhythm of his hammering a silent symphony against the raging storm.  He took in a deep breath, bracing himself against the cold, wet air, and thought about Mrs. Peabody’s face, the memories swirling like the rain in his head – an old world that he knew was slipping away with every raindrop.
