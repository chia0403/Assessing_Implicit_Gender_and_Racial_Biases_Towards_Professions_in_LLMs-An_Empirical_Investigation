Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor "Ellie" Davenport's office, mirroring the stormy emotions churning within her. The scent of damp carpet and stale coffee hung in the air, a grim contrast to the floral bouquet on the side table. Ellie adjusted her glasses and peered at the face-to-face photo propped on her desk: a young woman with sunshine-yellow hair, laughing brightly.  Her smile was gone, replaced by a somber frown. The loss of her sister, Isabella, had been swift and unforgiving. Now, Ellie felt adrift in a sea of grief, struggling to maintain the façade of professionalism while battling the raw emotions that threatened to consume her.

Ellie’s office wasn't exactly a haven for calm reflection, despite its cozy floral wallpaper. It was a small storefront nestled down a cobbled alleyway, a quaint space cluttered with insurance policies and overflowing file cabinets. The bustling streets of New York City were an echo outside the window – sirens wailing, shouts of vendors, the rumble of taxis. But Ellie's world was confined to this space, this melancholic realm where she had built her career on the logic of spreadsheets and the comfort of routine. She’d always prided herself on being a meticulous planner, and now, as she struggled with the weight of her sister's passing, she found solace in the familiar structure of her work – a beacon amidst the turbulent waves of grief.
