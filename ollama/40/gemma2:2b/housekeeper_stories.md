The air hung thick with the scent of dust and neglect, clinging to Amelia's worn clothes like cobwebs. The sprawling manor house, Blackwood Manor, was a monument to forgotten grandeur. Its once-gleaming marble floors were now marred by deep scratches and dustings that danced in the afternoon light filtering through grimy windows. A symphony of creaks echoed from the neglected wood beams above as Amelia swept across the grand entrance hall, her tired eyes tracing the faded tapestry depicting an epic scene of chivalry she'd seen countless times before.

She carried herself like a ghost, her own spirit dimmed by the weight of its silence. Now, as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the opulent furniture, Amelia felt a pang of loneliness pierce through her stoicism.
