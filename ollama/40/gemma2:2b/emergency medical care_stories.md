The late afternoon sun dipped behind the mountains, casting long shadows across the valley. A chill wind whipped through the narrow streets of Oakhaven, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and woodsmoke. Inside the cramped confines of Mercy's Station, Emergency Medical Service Unit 47, a cacophony of beeping monitors and frantic voices filled the air.  

Mercy Davis, a name she used to honor her mother, who had been an EMT herself, felt a familiar knot forming in her stomach. She was still adjusting to the constant hum of this chaotic life. Years on the road with EMS had taught her to navigate through storms, both natural and human-made. But there was always an underlying unease, a fear of what lurked around each corner, waiting to be unleashed.

Today's case was particularly grim. A young woman lay in the ambulance bay, her chest constricted by some unseen force.  Her face, barely visible under the harsh overhead lights, held a silent scream. Mercy knelt beside her, the cold metal of the equipment stark against her touch, as she fought to remain calm amidst the escalating tension. The air thrummed with a mix of fear and uncertainty, and Mercy knew that each passing minute was etching a deeper scar into this already-fragile life.
