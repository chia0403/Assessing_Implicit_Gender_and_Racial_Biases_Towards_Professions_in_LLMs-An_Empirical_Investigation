The sterile white walls of Dr. Eleanor Thorne's office hummed with an almost unnatural quiet. Outside, the city was bursting with life, horns blaring and sirens wailing in the distance, but here, within the confines of her practice, time seemed to have frozen. Even the rhythmic tick-tock of the old grandfather clock in the corner seemed to slow down, mirroring the stillness that gripped Eleanor's heart. The waiting room chairs, usually filled with nervous patients and their worried children, stood deserted. This hadn't been a slow day, but this was beyond unusual. 

Eleanor adjusted her glasses, squinting at the manila envelope she held in her hand. It bore no return address, only a single handwritten note scrawled on the front: "Meet me at the lighthouse, dusk." Inside, a single photograph lay nestled in a corner of the letter's folds: A lone figure standing against the backdrop of an ocean sunset, their back towards the camera. The setting sun cast long shadows over the face of the person in the photo – a faint outline of someone with piercing blue eyes and hair the color of wheat. But it was the smile that captured Eleanor’s attention; the flash of white teeth and lips in a silent, enigmatic grin.
