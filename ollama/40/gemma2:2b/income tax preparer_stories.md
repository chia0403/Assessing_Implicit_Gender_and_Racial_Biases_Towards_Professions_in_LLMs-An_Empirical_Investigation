The stale coffee scent clung to the air like an unwelcome ghost in Amelia's tiny apartment. It was 6:00 AM, which meant it was time for another night of spreadsheets and forms – another Tuesday morning in the endless abyss that was "tax season." She ran a weary hand through her already messy blonde hair, glancing over at the overflowing filing cabinet beside her desk.  Her name, Amelia Thorne, felt like an afterthought, a mundane label attached to yet another year of battling the complexities of the American tax code.

Amelia's small office in the back room of "Thorne & Co," wasn't exactly glamorous. Posters depicting the serenity of Mount Fuji and motivational quotes about financial freedom stared down at her as she meticulously checked balances against last year’s forms. But beneath the mundane facade, a spark remained – a stubborn ember fueled by years of watching families struggle to navigate this confusing world of deductions and credits. Tonight, however, that ember felt dimmer than usual.

The recent news about rising inflation and potential economic downturn hung like a heavy curtain over Amelia's usually optimistic outlook. As she began sifting through a pile of tax returns, each one another reminder of her responsibility to guide these individuals towards something resembling financial stability, she couldn't help but wonder if the ember would burn out completely this year.
