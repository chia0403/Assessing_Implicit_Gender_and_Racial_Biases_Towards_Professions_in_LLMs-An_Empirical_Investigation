The midday sun beat down on Harlan 'Hawk' Hawkins' weathered face, baking his hair as he tightened the last bolts on the guardrail. The rhythmic clang of tools against metal was an almost hypnotic soundtrack to the endless stretches of asphalt that stretched before him. Just beyond the steel barrier, the interstate snaked its way through the heartland, a concrete artery pulsing with the lives and stories it carried every day.

Hawk was one of many who labored on this behemoth of progress, their tools and hands weaving a tapestry of steel and tarmac across this unforgiving landscape. He’d been here five years now, and even after countless miles driven and jobs completed, the endless flatness of the plains never failed to leave him feeling tiny, adrift in an ocean of grey monotony. 

He looked down at his worn boots, scuffed and speckled with dirt from months of working the hard-worn earth. The air was heavy with diesel fumes and a hint of salt spray, remnants of the recent storm that had swept through the coastal regions north. He sighed, pushing back a stray strand of grey hair with the back of his hand, a weary smile gracing his lips as he felt the familiar sting of freedom in the crisp, clean air – freedom from the daily grind, freedom from the mundane.
