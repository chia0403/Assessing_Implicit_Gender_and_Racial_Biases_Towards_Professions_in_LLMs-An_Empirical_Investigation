The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and blood, a familiar aroma that clung to every corner of Silas Blackwood's humble shop. The light from the single window was dim, casting long shadows across the polished oak counters, where rows of gleaming knives gleamed like silver teeth. It was nearing dusk on Market Day in Oakhaven, the little town nestled deep within the valley's embrace. A chill wind whistled through the old wooden doors of Blackwood's Meats, bringing with it a hint of coming winter and a sense of anticipation for the lively bustle that awaited them. 

Silas Blackwood, his hands rough and calloused, was in the middle of a flurry of activity. He deftly carved a side of beef into perfect cuts, each one radiating an earthy aroma that spoke of life and sustenance.  His face, framed by a thick silver fringe, wore a tired but determined expression as he worked, the years etched into him like the grain on his trusty butcher's block.  This wasn't just about meat; it was about tradition, skill, and the quiet satisfaction of fulfilling the primal need for nourishment. 
 
But tonight, something felt different. A strange unease hung in the air, a prickling sensation at the back of Silas's neck that he couldn't quite place. The silence of the shop, usually filled with the rhythmic clattering of meat cleavers and the chatter of customers, was oppressive, a heavy blanket on his bustling trade.
