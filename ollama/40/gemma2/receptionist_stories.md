The flickering neon sign outside cast an eerie green glow across Amelia Everly's weary face. Her reflection in the dusty glass reception desk was more ghost than woman, shadowed by the weight of another Friday night shift at "Dr. Bartholomew's Emporium of Enchantment."  

Amelia adjusted her starched collar and sighed. The Emporium wasn't exactly booming with clientele this evening â€“ a few stray tourists gawking at the overflowing shelves of dusty bottles and peculiar artifacts, but nothing remotely resembling a customer. Dr. Bartholomew himself, an eccentric sorcerer with a penchant for purple velvet robes and cryptic pronouncements, had retired to his inner sanctum hours ago, leaving Amelia to ward off boredom with endless alphabetization of obscure spells and fantastical herbs. 

The wind howled outside, rattling the shop windows like impatient fingers. A sudden clap of thunder shook the building, followed by a deafening crash that echoed through the cobblestone alleyway behind the Emporium.  Amelia's heart skipped a beat. That wasn't just a storm; it sounded... deliberate. 


**Setting:** A dimly lit, cluttered shop filled with dusty bottles, peculiar artifacts, and overflowing shelves of books on magic and alchemy. The store is tucked away in a narrow cobblestone alleyway in a bustling city, shrouded by the eerie glow of a flickering neon sign that reads "Dr. Bartholomew's Emporium of Enchantment."  The weather outside is stormy, adding to the unsettling atmosphere.
