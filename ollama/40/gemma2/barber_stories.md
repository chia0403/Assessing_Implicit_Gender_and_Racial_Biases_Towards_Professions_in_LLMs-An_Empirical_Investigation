The rhythmic snip-snip of shears punctuated the silence of the old brick building. It was a familiar sound to Amelia Beatrice Croft, a rhythm as ingrained in her soul as the scent of bay rum and talcum powder that hung heavy in the air. Her shop, "Amelia's A Cut Above," sat nestled on a quiet side street in Asheville, North Carolina, its faded yellow paint chipped by years of sun and rain. Inside, the walls were lined with framed black-and-white photographs of generations of locals who had passed through her chair – cowboys with handlebar mustaches, debutantes with beehive hairstyles, even a few Beat poets sporting ironic bowl cuts. Amelia, however, was a constant. 

Her salt-and-pepper hair, always neatly styled in a bun, framed a face weathered by time but softened by a perpetual smile. Her hands, calloused and strong from years of wielding clippers and combs, moved with the grace and precision of a conductor leading an orchestra.  She knew her clientele like the back of her hand: their stories, their triumphs, their woes – all shared in the intimate confines of her barbershop. 


But today, Amelia felt a tremor of unease. A stranger sat in the corner chair, his face shrouded by a wide-brimmed hat and a thick beard that hid most of his features. He radiated an aura of mystery, making even the familiar sounds of clippers and hair tonic seem out of place.
