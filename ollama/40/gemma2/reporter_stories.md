The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Amy" Brighton like a second skin as she weaved through the bustling Saturday market in Savannah.  Sun-warmed peaches and freshly baked sweetgrass baskets filled the air with scents that mingled with the salty tang of the nearby ocean. Tourists, many sporting cameras slung around their necks, jostled against locals haggling over prices. Amy, however, was focused on a much different kind of story – one whispered in hushed tones, shrouded in secrecy and tinged with fear.

She adjusted the strap of her battered camera bag, its weight a familiar comfort against her hip, and approached a stall overflowing with antique jewelry. The vendor, a woman with eyes as sharp as her silver earrings, seemed to sense Amy’s interest before she spoke. 

"Looking for something special, dearie?" she rasped, her voice roughened by years of market chatter and sea wind.


Amy smiled, the practiced warmth concealing her steely determination. "Just browsing, ma'am," she said, her gaze lingering on a tarnished silver locket nestled amongst the trinkets.  "But I do love a good story." 

The woman’s smile faltered, replaced by a fleeting look of apprehension. 
 “Some stories,” she whispered, her voice barely audible above the market din, "are best left untold.”



Amy's reporter's instincts flared. This was it. The opening to a story that promised to unravel more than just a hidden past – it promised to expose secrets buried deep within Savannah's soul.
