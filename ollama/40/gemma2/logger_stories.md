The dawn mist clung to Elias Thorne's beard like a second skin as he surveyed the day's work ahead. The towering pines, frosted with morning dew, stretched towards the sky, their needles whispering secrets in the crisp air. Elias inhaled deeply, the scent of pine and damp earth filling his lungs â€“ a familiar comfort that grounded him amidst the ever-shifting wilderness. 

The sun was just beginning to paint the horizon in hues of orange and gold, casting long shadows across the logging site. The heavy metallic clang of chainsaws echoed through the forest, punctuated by the rhythmic grunt of men hauling logs. This was Elias's domain, a world he understood better than any city street or crowded tavern. 


This was Oregon in 1930, a time when the forests were vast and untamed, where life was hard but honest, and where men like Elias Thorne carved their livelihoods from the raw heart of the wilderness.
