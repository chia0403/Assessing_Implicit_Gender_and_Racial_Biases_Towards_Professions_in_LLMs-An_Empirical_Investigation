The air in "Diamonds & Dreams" was thick with the scent of lilies and desperation.  

Eleanor Beatrice Finch adjusted her scarlet lipstick, its bold hue mirroring the fiery ambition burning in her chest.  She surveyed the cluttered showroom floor, its plush carpets dulled by years of hurried footsteps and hushed bargains. The only sound besides the tinkling of a forgotten wind chime was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her acrylic nails against the glass counter.

Eleanor had been at Diamonds & Dreams for three years, peddling sparkling baubles to customers who dreamed of luxury and forever love.  She’d sold engagement rings, righting wrongs with anniversaries, celebrating births and even drowning sorrows in diamonds. But lately, sales were down. The sparkle was fading, both from the store's windows and Eleanor’s own heart.   Something had to change.

Today, a new shipment arrived. One that promised to shake things up – or break them entirely.  Eleanor hoped for the former, because right now, her future felt as fragile as a chipped diamond.
