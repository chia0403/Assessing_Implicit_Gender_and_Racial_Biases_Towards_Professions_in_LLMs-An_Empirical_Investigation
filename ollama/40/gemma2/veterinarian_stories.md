The pungent aroma of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that usually comforted Dr. Elara Anya Sharma. But today, the sterile tang only intensified her anxiety. The waiting room was unusually quiet, save for the rhythmic ticking of the antique clock on the wall – each tick another reminder of the impending storm.  

Elara ran a hand through her unruly dark curls, trying to quell the nervous flutter in her stomach. Her clinic, nestled amidst the vibrant chaos of New Delhi's bustling Chandni Chowk market, was usually a symphony of barks, meows, and frantic chirps. Yet, today, an unnerving silence hung over everything. Even the stray cats who usually scavenged for scraps outside seemed to have vanished, leaving behind an emptiness that mirrored Elara's own dread.  

The news had been relentless – reports of strange illnesses affecting animals, escalating from mild lethargy to severe tremors and seizures. No one knew what was causing it, and fear spread through the city like wildfire. The phone hadn’t stopped ringing all morning, each call a plea for help, a desperate hope that Elara could offer a solution. 


Elara took a deep breath, her reflection staring back from the dusty glass door – eyes filled with determination, a faint tremor betraying her inner turmoil. She couldn't let fear paralyze her. The animals depended on her, as they always had.  

It was time to face the storm.
