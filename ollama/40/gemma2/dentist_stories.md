The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the polished stainless steel instruments arranged with military precision on Dr. Amelia Brightwell's dental tray. Outside her window, the bustling city of Chicago pulsed with life, but inside her office, the air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and anticipation. A low groan from the chair in front of her brought Amelia back to the present. 

"Just a touch more, Mr. Davis," she said soothingly, adjusting the tiny mirror and peering into his open mouth. "You're doing great."  Mr. Davis, a portly man with worry lines etched deep around his eyes, sighed and nodded. He wasn't fond of dentists, but he couldn't afford to ignore the throbbing pain that had plagued him for weeks. 

Amelia knew the drill: extract the wisdom tooth, soothe the inevitable discomfort, send him home with a prescription for painkillers, and pray he wouldn’t call back with complications. But something about Mr. Davis – his hesitant smile, the tremor in his hands – made her want to do more than just treat his physical ailment. 


Maybe, she thought, there was more to this appointment than a simple extraction.
