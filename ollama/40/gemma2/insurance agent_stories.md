The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of salt and honeysuckle as Amelia Rosethorn adjusted her floral-print blouse. She hated the summer in this city; the heat clung to you like a damp towel, making even simple tasks feel monumental. Her office, tucked away on the second floor of a building overlooking the cobblestone streets of King Street, offered little respite. The air conditioning hummed with strained effort against the relentless Charleston sun.

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. She was supposed to be meeting with Mr. Archibald Grimshaw at two, a particularly wealthy retiree who had been on Amelia's client list for years. His requests were always simple: "Increase my coverage," "Lower my premiums," "Make sure I'm protected from the unimaginable." He never seemed to understand that there was no such thing as complete protection against life's curveballs.  

Her gaze drifted towards a framed photograph on her desk, a reminder of what truly mattered. Her husband, Liam, beamed back at her, his arm slung around their daughter, Lily. The picture had been taken just before Lily started kindergarten, capturing that fleeting moment of childhood innocence. It was a stark contrast to the weight of responsibilities Amelia carried, both professionally and personally. She needed this meeting with Mr. Grimshaw to go smoothly.  

Suddenly, the phone on her desk jangled, pulling Amelia back from her daydreams. A woman's voice, breathless and frantic, filled her ear. 


"Miss Rosethorn? It's Mrs. Eleanor Hayes...there's been an accident..."
