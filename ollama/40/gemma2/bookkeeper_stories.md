The flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across Agnes Pemberton's ledgers. Dust motes danced in the pale illumination, swirling like miniature galaxies around her quill as she painstakingly transferred figures from one column to another. The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and pipe tobacco, a familiar aroma in the cramped backroom office that served as both Agnes’ workspace and sanctuary. 

It was late, well past midnight, and the only sounds were the rhythmic scratching of her quill, the occasional sigh escaping her lips, and the distant rumble of London's slumbering heart beyond the shop window.  Agnes wasn’t a woman who enjoyed solitude, but tonight, with the weight of Mr. Bartholomew’s increasingly suspicious accounts pressing down on her, she craved it. 

The bookshop itself was quiet, its shelves overflowing with dusty tomes and forgotten histories. A lone oil lamp flickered near the front counter, casting an ethereal glow on the spines of countless stories waiting to be rediscovered. Agnes longed to delve into their pages, to escape for a while from the tedium of numbers and the nagging unease that had settled upon her like a shroud. But duty called, and tonight, duty meant unraveling the tangled web Mr. Bartholomew's finances had become.
