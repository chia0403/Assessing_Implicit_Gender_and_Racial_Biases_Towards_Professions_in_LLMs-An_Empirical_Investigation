The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thistlewoodâ€™s head, their sterile glow casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of the Guidance Office. A faint aroma of stale coffee and disinfectant hung in the air, mingling with the scent of nervous sweat emanating from the teenagers who shuffled through her door each day. Today was no different. The bell had just rung, releasing a fresh wave of anxious faces into Amelia's domain.  She sat behind her massive oak desk, its surface scarred by years of well-meaning doodles and desperate pleas for help. 

Amelia Thistlewood, with her perpetually tousled auburn hair and kind eyes that held the wisdom of countless adolescent struggles, was their last bastion of hope. She listened patiently to their woes, offering words of encouragement, practical advice, and sometimes just a warm smile when the weight of their problems felt too heavy to bear.  

Today, however, a new kind of anxiety pulsed through the air, thicker than usual. The news that had swept across the nation the previous evening - a looming economic crisis that threatened countless jobs - cast a pall over the usually boisterous high school hallways. 


Amelia adjusted her spectacles and glanced at the clock. She had ten minutes before her first appointment. Ten minutes to prepare herself for another day of navigating the emotional minefield that was adolescence, amplified tenfold by the anxieties swirling around them all.
