The sun, already blistering by 7 am, beat down on Bartholomew “Bart” Jackson’s back as he wielded his jackhammer.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, mirroring the churning in Bart's gut. The roar of the machine drowned out everything else: the buzzing of cicadas, the distant rumble of trucks on I-80, even the foreman’s shouted instructions. 

Bart squinted through the haze, his face a mosaic of sweat and grime.  The Nevada desert stretched before him, an endless expanse of shimmering heat and sunbaked earth. The highway, a ribbon of grey snaking across this desolate landscape, was their domain. His domain. A place where asphalt met sky, and men like Bart toiled under the unforgiving gaze of the sun.   


This wasn’t Bart's dream, not by any stretch of the imagination.  He had dreamt of becoming a writer, of crafting tales that would transport readers to worlds beyond this arid wasteland. But life, as it often did, had other plans. He'd found himself here, on this lonely highway, battling potholes and scorching temperatures instead of weaving words on a page. 


But today felt different.  There was an undercurrent of anticipation in the air, a tremor that ran deeper than the vibrations of his jackhammer. Something was coming. Bart could feel it in his bones. He just didn’t know what it was.
