The air in Elias Blackwood's workshop hung thick with dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams that slanted through the grime-coated windows. The scent of clay and sweat mingled with the sharp tang of sandstone, a familiar perfume to Elias after thirty years spent coaxing beauty from rough blocks of stone. His calloused fingers, gnarled like ancient roots, traced the contours of a half-finished angel, its delicate wings poised for flight. 

Elias's workshop was tucked away in a forgotten corner of Veridian City, a sprawling metropolis built upon layers of time and trade. The city pulsed with life, a cacophony of merchants hawking their wares, street musicians vying for attention, and the rumbling of carts navigating cobblestone streets. Yet, Elias found solace in his quiet sanctuary, where the rhythmic clang of his hammer against stone was the only music that mattered.  

But today, a restless energy thrummed beneath the familiar rhythm of work. A letter, delivered earlier by a messenger with anxious eyes, lay unopened on his workbench. It bore the crest of House Alderwood, an ancient and powerful noble family he had once served. The return address sent a shiver down Elias's spine â€“ a summons from Lord Alderwood himself.
