The rain hammered against the frosted windows of Dr. Eleanor Ashworth’s office, each drop a tiny fist pounding on the glass, mirroring the storm brewing within her own chest. She stared out at the blurry cityscape, a canvas of neon and shadow reflecting the turmoil in her own soul.  

Eleanor's office was tucked away on the third floor of a worn-down brick building in downtown Seattle. The building smelled faintly of damp wood and forgotten dreams. Her waiting room was sparsely furnished with two mismatched armchairs, their faded velvet upholstery whispering tales of countless anxieties confessed and hopes shared. A framed print of a tranquil beach scene hung askew above a rickety bookshelf overflowing with psychology textbooks, the ironic juxtaposition highlighting the dissonance between serenity and reality. 

Eleanor had always prided herself on being the calm in her patients’ storms, but lately, she felt like the storm itself was raging within her, threatening to engulf everything she held dear. A patient's recent confession had stirred up a painful past, one she thought she had finally buried, and now it threatened to consume her whole.
