The greasy spoon diner smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon sign advertising "Joe's Place" into a wavering, spectral beacon. Inside, huddled over a chipped mug of lukewarm tea, sat Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzwilliam, his worn wrench glinting under the fluorescent lights. He was a man whose life mirrored the diner: perpetually damp, greasy in places, and smelling faintly of despair. 

Bart had been plumbing pipes for twenty years, each one telling a story - a leaky faucet whispering tales of forgetfulness, a busted boiler shouting about neglect. But this wasn't just another day fixing leaks and unclogging drains. This call was different. It came from the old Victorian mansion at the edge of town, shrouded in whispers and local legends.  He knew the risks, but Bart also knew that ignoring a call like this would be far worse. 


The rain intensified, drumming a relentless rhythm on the diner's roof as Bart finished his tea, shoved down a stale donut, and steeled himself for whatever awaited him inside those haunted walls.
