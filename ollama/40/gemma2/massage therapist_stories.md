The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually soothed Amelia Willowbrook's soul. Today, however, it felt oppressive, mirroring the tightness coiled in her chest. The worn wooden floorboards creaked underfoot as she made her way to the treatment room, each step echoing her unease.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the sprawling garden of "Willow's Rest," Amelia's small massage therapy practice tucked away on a quiet lane in rural Vermont.  Stone walls bordered the manicured lawns, climbing hydrangeas bursting with vibrant blooms, and the gentle murmur of the nearby creek provided a peaceful backdrop - all usually conducive to tranquility. 

But today, there was an unsettling stillness in the air, a pregnant silence that vibrated with anticipation. Amelia pushed open the door to her designated treatment room, the familiar scent of warm towels and sandalwood oil doing little to ease her anxious heart.  Her patient, a Mr. Silas Blackwood, was already seated on the massage table, his shadowed features hidden behind a thick newspaper. 


Amelia took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. This wasn't just any appointment.  Mr. Blackwood had been requesting sessions for weeks, and each time he seemed more and more agitated, his words clipped and tense, hinting at a darkness she couldn't quite grasp. She needed to be calm, professional. To help him find some peace. 


But as she approached the table, a chilling sense of foreboding washed over her, leaving a cold knot in her stomach that refused to loosen its grip.
