The late summer air hung heavy with humidity in Savannah, Georgia. Cicadas hummed their incessant song, a counterpoint to the rhythmic slap of Amelia "Amy" Rose Thompson's heels against the cobblestone street. She smoothed her linen blazer and adjusted the brim of her straw hat, shielding her eyes from the sun glinting off the Spanish moss draped over ancient oaks.  

It was another scorcher, but Amy wouldn't have traded this city for anything. The charm, the history, the undeniable allure of the Lowcountry â€“ it all fueled her passion for real estate. Today's appointment, a Victorian mansion on Bull Street, promised to be particularly interesting. She could almost feel the ghosts of Savannah whispering in her ear as she approached the grand iron gates, each creak and groan hinting at secrets untold.
