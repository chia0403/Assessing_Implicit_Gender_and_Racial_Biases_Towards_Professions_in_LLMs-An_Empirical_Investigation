The sterile scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sickly sweet aroma of antiseptic wipes. Amelia Claire Peterson, her stethoscope slung around her neck like a familiar talisman, surveyed the crowded waiting room of Dr. Evans’ practice. A cacophony of coughs and sniffles filled the space, punctuated by the occasional frantic whisper from a worried parent. 

Amelia felt a pang of sympathy for them all – each person in this room carrying their own anxieties, their own stories of illness and fear. She was used to it, of course. This small-town clinic in rural Montana had become her second home, its worn furniture and faded posters a constant backdrop to the drama of human lives unfolding day after day. 

But today felt different. A simmering unease thrummed beneath the surface of the usual chaos. Maybe it was the way the sun seemed to cast long, ominous shadows across the room, or perhaps it was the whispered rumors circulating about a mysterious illness spreading through the nearby mining town. Whatever it was, Amelia couldn't shake off the feeling that something big was brewing.
