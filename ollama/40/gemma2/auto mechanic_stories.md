The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and gasoline, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of Wren Eleanor Hayes's wrench against metal. Grease smudged her brow like war paint, a badge of honor in this concrete jungle she called her workshop. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windows, illuminating the chaotic symphony of tools laid out on every surface: wrenches, sockets, screwdrivers, and an assortment of other implements designed to coax life from the groaning carcasses of discarded vehicles. 

Her "garage," more accurately a repurposed warehouse on the outskirts of New Orleans, hummed with activity. The air vibrated with the low growl of an engine undergoing surgery, punctuated by the hiss of escaping steam. Wren worked in a trance, her movements efficient and practiced, as she wrestled with a rusted fuel line on a 1970s Mustang. It was a piece of Americana, its faded paint job whispering tales of forgotten road trips and endless summer nights.  

Wren loved these machines. They were honest, straightforward creatures, their inner workings laid bare like open books. Unlike people, they didn't have the capacity to betray or disappoint.  They just needed a little TLC to keep them running. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on her skin, a feeling that this repair, this simple fuel line, was somehow more significant than it seemed.
