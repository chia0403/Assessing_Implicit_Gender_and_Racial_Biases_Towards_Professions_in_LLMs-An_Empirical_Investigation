The incessant whirring of the old Dictaphone was like a metronome keeping time with Eleanor Ophelia Beaumont's mounting frustration.  

It wasn't the machine itself – it was Mr. Worthington’s dictation. He always started his morning missives with an unnecessarily verbose preamble about the weather, as if his thoughts on the drizzle were of paramount importance to the successful execution of their company's real estate acquisitions. "A rather damp morning, Miss Beaumont," he’d rasp through the mouthpiece, "reminds one of the precarious nature of our endeavors…"

Eleanor tapped her manicured nails against her oak desk, her silver rings catching the light filtering through the dusty windowpanes of Mr. Worthington's office.  The room was a testament to his antiquated tastes: leather-bound tomes crammed onto shelves reaching towards the high ceiling, a grandfather clock ticking with solemn regularity, and a faded floral wallpaper that seemed to have absorbed all the sunshine in its lifetime. A faint scent of pipe tobacco lingered in the air, a testament to Mr. Worthington's habit of puffing away during his dictations, creating a smoky haze that Eleanor found particularly irritating. 

Outside, the city hummed with the energy of a new day. But within the confines of this dusty office, time seemed to stand still, punctuated only by the rhythmic clickety-clack of her typewriter and the incessant drone of Mr. Worthington's pronouncements on the unpredictable nature of life and real estate.
