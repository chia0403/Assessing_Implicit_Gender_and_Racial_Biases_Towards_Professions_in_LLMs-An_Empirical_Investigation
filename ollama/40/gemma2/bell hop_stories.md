The air in the lobby of the Grand Astor Hotel hung thick with the scent of lilies and stale cigar smoke.  A faint jazz melody drifted from the hidden speakeasy downstairs, mingling with the clinking of teacups and the hushed conversations of wealthy patrons. Bartholomew "Barty" Quillfeather, a scrawny young man with perpetually messy brown hair and eyes that seemed to absorb everything around him, weaved through the elegant crowd with practiced ease. A worn bellhop uniform clung to his lean frame, the brass buttons catching the dim light filtering through the ornate chandeliers.  

Barty had seen it all in his four years at the Grand Astor: clandestine meetings, whispered romances, extravagant parties that spilled into the early morning hours, and the occasional scandal that rocked the gilded cage of high society. But tonight felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up his spine, a sense that something was about to shift, like the air before a storm.  He couldn't explain it, but Barty knew this night would be unlike any other.
