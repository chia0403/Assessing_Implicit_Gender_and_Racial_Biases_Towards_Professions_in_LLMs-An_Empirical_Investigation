The sun, a molten orange eye peering over the rolling hills of Wiltshire, cast long shadows across Bartholomew Thistlewick's weathered face as he surveyed his land. A gentle breeze rustled through the barley fields, whispering promises of a bountiful harvest if only the heavens would cooperate. But Bartholomew knew better than to trust the whims of nature. Years on this unforgiving earth had taught him that the soil was a fickle mistress, rewarding generosity with abundance and punishing greed with barrenness. He tightened his grip on his well-worn walking stick, its hickory handle smooth from years of use, and turned towards the ramshackle farmhouse, its red brick facade faded by time and weather. 


Inside, the aroma of freshly brewed tea mingled with the earthy scent of hay, a comforting blend that Bartholomew had come to associate with home. His wife, Elspeth, hummed a tuneless melody as she kneaded dough for their midday bread, her movements practiced and efficient. The familiar scene, played out day after day, was a balm to Bartholomew's soul, anchoring him to the rhythm of life on his small patch of land.
