The humid air clung to Amelia "Ace" Vance like a second skin as she stepped out onto the tarmac, her combat boots sinking slightly into the dew-soaked grass. Dawn was breaking over the sprawling military base in Kandahar, Afghanistan, casting long shadows across rows of hulking transport aircraft and sleek fighter jets. A thin layer of smoke hung in the air, remnants of last night's cook fire mingling with the scent of diesel fuel and burnt toast from the nearby mess hall. 

Ace ran a hand through her short, choppy hair, letting out a long sigh as she adjusted the strap of her flight helmet. Today was different. This wasn't another routine supply run or reconnaissance mission. Today, Ace was leading a strike team against a heavily fortified Taliban stronghold deep in the mountains, a mission that felt heavier on her shoulders than any payload she’d ever carried. 


She glanced at her reflection in the dusty windshield of her F-16, catching her own determined gaze staring back. A single, jagged scar traced its way across her right cheekbone, a souvenir from a close call a year ago. It served as a constant reminder – a promise to herself and those she flew with – that every mission was a gamble, every flight a fight for survival.
