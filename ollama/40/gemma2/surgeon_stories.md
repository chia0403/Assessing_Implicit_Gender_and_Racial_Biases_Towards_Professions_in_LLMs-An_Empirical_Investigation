Her gloved hands moved with practiced precision, deftly suturing a torn artery in a young boy’s leg. Each stitch was a silent promise – a pledge to mend not just flesh, but also the shattered hope that mirrored in his wide, tear-filled eyes.

A place where life and death danced on a razor’s edge, where seconds stretched into eons and each decision carried the weight of eternity. It was a world she navigated with unwavering focus, her dedication to her craft a shield against the chaos that simmered beneath the surface.  


But tonight, Amelia sensed something different in the air. A prickle of unease, like a whisper on the wind, hinting at an impending storm.
