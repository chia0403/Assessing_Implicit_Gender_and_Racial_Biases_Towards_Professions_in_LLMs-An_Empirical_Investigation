The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting fractured rainbows across the rain-slicked sidewalk. Inside "The Rusty Mug," Amelia Rose Hawthorne wiped down the already spotless mahogany bar with a practiced hand, her movements as smooth and familiar as an old waltz. The scent of stale beer, damp wool coats, and simmering chili hung in the air, a comforting aroma she'd grown accustomed to over the years. 

Amelia was used to the symphony of sounds that filled the pub on a Friday night – the clatter of mugs, the boisterous laughter of regulars huddled around worn tables, the mournful strains of a blues song crooning from the corner jukebox.  But tonight felt different, a tension simmering beneath the usual chaos like a pot left on the back burner too long. 


The rain hammered against the windows, blurring the world outside into a hazy canvas of grey and green. Amelia glanced at the clock – almost midnight. She knew most of the regulars would be gone soon, leaving behind a handful of stragglers who lingered over their drinks like moths drawn to a dying flame.
