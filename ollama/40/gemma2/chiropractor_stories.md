The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Amelia "Amy" Thorne's waiting room. It was a haven of calm in the bustling Chicago suburb – pale blue walls, soft jazz drifting from concealed speakers, and the faint scent of lavender essential oil wafting from the diffuser. A ceramic teapot sat on a small table beside a bowl overflowing with plush, rainbow-colored throw pillows, offering a respite for anyone needing a moment to unwind before their appointment.

Dr. Thorne herself was bustling about, adjusting the display of locally sourced candles and straightening the stack of holistic health pamphlets on the side table. She loved her practice – "Thorne Alignment", a small haven dedicated to restoring balance in both body and mind.  But lately, a disquiet had settled over her like an unwelcome chill. It wasn't just the increasing number of patients complaining of stress-induced back pain or headaches; it was a feeling, a sense that something was amiss, a crack in the otherwise harmonious fabric of her life.
