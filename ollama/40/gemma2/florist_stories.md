The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that usually brought Emilia Rosepetal comfort. But today, it felt oppressive, like a shroud draped over her small flower shop, "Petal and Bloom." The morning sun struggled to pierce through the storm clouds gathering outside, casting long, ominous shadows across the rows of vibrant blooms.

Her reflection in the glass display case showed tired eyes beneath a tangle of auburn curls, mirroring the exhaustion she felt creeping into her bones. Business had been slow lately, even with the approaching Valentine's Day just a week away. The usual bustle of eager customers seeking romantic gestures seemed absent, replaced by an eerie silence that echoed through the shop like a whispered warning. 


As if to confirm her unease, a low rumble shook the building, followed by a flash of lightning that momentarily illuminated the dusty street outside. It was going to be one of those days.
