The morning mist hung heavy over Blackwood Manor, clinging to the ancient oaks like spectral shrouds. Dewdrops, fat and glistening, clung to the blades of emerald grass beneath Arthur Bartholomew Thistlewick’s boots as he traversed the manicured lawn. He tugged his woolen cap further down over his ears, the chill biting through his threadbare coat.

He knew every crack in the cobblestones, every bend in the rose trellis, every rustle of leaves that heralded a squirrel’s descent. For him, the sprawling estate held a quiet beauty, a comforting familiarity amidst the ever-shifting tides of life beyond its weathered walls.

Arthur couldn't shake a feeling that something was amiss, a prickling at the back of his neck that whispered of secrets hidden beneath the manor's grand facade.
