The scent of jasmine hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that seemed to cling to Dr. Amelia Brightwell like a second skin as she stepped into her office.  Sunlight streamed through the tall windows overlooking the bustling city street, casting squares of warm light onto the mismatched Persian rugs and plush velvet armchairs scattered around the room. It was a space designed to feel safe, comforting, a haven from the chaos that churned outside these walls. 

Amelia took a deep breath, inhaling the scent of lavender essential oil diffuser humming quietly in the corner. Today's schedule was packed: anxiety, grief, relationship troubles – the usual mix of human struggles. She adjusted her glasses, settling them comfortably on the bridge of her nose, and glanced at the first name on her list: "Sarah Thompson." A knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach. This wasn’t just another session; Sarah had been referred to Amelia by a colleague who'd spoken with hushed tones about a case that was both complex and deeply troubling.  


Amelia hoped she was up to the challenge.
