The fluorescent lights hummed above Eliza Bethany Cartwright's head like a swarm of irritable bees. Each buzz seemed to echo her own mounting frustration. 

It was Tuesday, which meant Mrs. Henderson would be in precisely at 3:17 p.m., demanding to speak to the manager about the price of bananas for the fourth time this month. Then there was young Timmy from down the street who always tried to pay with a handful of crumpled dollar bills and loose change, forcing Eliza into a meticulous, soul-crushing count.  

But right now, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and day-old donuts, the only soundtrack the dull thwack of the keyboard as Eliza scanned a bag of microwave popcorn. The setting sun cast long shadows across the linoleum floor of the "Everyday Value" grocery store, its chipped paint and faded signage whispering tales of countless forgotten transactions. 


Eliza sighed, her reflection staring back at her from the dusty glass of the refrigerated display case. She couldn't remember the last time she felt anything but a dull ache of weariness. It wasn't just the job; it was everything. The world outside seemed as chaotic and unyielding as the endless stream of customers filing through these doors, each with their own burdens to bear, their own stories unfolding behind tired eyes.
