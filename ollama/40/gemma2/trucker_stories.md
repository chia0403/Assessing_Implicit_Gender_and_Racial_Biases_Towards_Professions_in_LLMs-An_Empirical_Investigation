The diesel engine hummed beneath Delmar 'Diamond' Riley, a steady baritone counterpoint to the whine of wind whipping through the cracks in his cab window. Outside, the endless Kansas plains stretched before him like a sea of golden wheat, rippling under the pale glow of the rising sun. The thermometer on the dashboard read 48 degrees – not bad for October.  Diamond squinted at the horizon, searching for the familiar blue glint of Interstate 70 ahead. Another day, another haul. This time, it was a load of canned peaches destined for Chicago. Nothing glamorous, but reliable. And reliable was exactly what Diamond needed after last week's near-disaster in Texas – a story he wasn't quite ready to tell even the rusty dashboard figurines clinging precariously to his rearview mirror.  He reached for his thermos of lukewarm coffee, its cardboard cup already damp with condensation. It wouldn't be long now before the sunrise painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, turning the wheat fields into shimmering gold. Then the real work began.
