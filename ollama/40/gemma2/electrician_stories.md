The neon sign above "Sam's Diner" flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt. The downpour had started just as Silas Blackwood arrived, his calloused hands gripping the wrench in one and the worn handle of his tool bag in the other.  He was supposed to be off tonight, enjoying a rare night out with Sarah, but Mrs. Peterson's call about her flickering lights had been impossible to ignore. After all, what good was a love for vintage pinball machines if they couldn't be played under proper illumination?

Silas, his name a symphony of whispers in the wind on nights like this, tugged his thick wool coat tighter against the biting November air. The diner itself seemed to huddle in on itself, its faded red paint clinging desperately to the weathered wood. Steam curled from the cracked windowpanes, creating hazy, ghostly figures that danced in the neon's sickly light. He could smell burnt coffee and grease mingling with the dampness of the night, a familiar aroma that always reminded him of his childhood spent tinkering in his grandfather's dusty workshop. 


Silas pushed open the diner door, its jingle announcing his arrival in the almost silent space. A lone waitress, her nametag reading 'Brenda', looked up from wiping down a sticky counter. Her expression was weary, etched with the kind of exhaustion that comes from facing another rainy night alone.  He gave her a tired smile, "Mrs. Peterson?"
