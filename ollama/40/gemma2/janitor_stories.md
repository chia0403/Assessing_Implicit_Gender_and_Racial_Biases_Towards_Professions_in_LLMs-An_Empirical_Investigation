The fluorescent lights hummed their monotonous tune above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sterile glow on the linoleum floor she scrubbed with grim determination.  It was 2:00 am, the witching hour at the Grand Blackwood Hotel, and Amelia was alone save for the ghost of silence that clung to the opulent halls like cobwebs. The air hung thick with the perfume of forgotten elegance - a cloying mix of lilies and mothballs that whispered tales of lavish parties and heartbroken lovers long gone. Outside her window, a storm raged, rain lashing against the glass like angry fists. Inside, Amelia felt the familiar ache of loneliness settle in her chest, as comforting and unwelcome as the damp chill seeping through the drafty corridors. 


Amelia wasn't just any janitor. She was the guardian of Grand Blackwood's secrets, a silent observer to its fading glory. Her mop, bucket, and worn-out duster were her armor against the whispers that swirled around the old hotel - whispers of ghostly apparitions, hidden treasures, and a darkness lurking beneath its polished facade. 


Tonight, however, something felt different. The air crackled with an unfamiliar energy, and even the storm seemed to hold its breath in anticipation. A shiver ran down Amelia's spine, not from the cold, but from a premonition that the night was about to unfold in ways she could never have imagined.
