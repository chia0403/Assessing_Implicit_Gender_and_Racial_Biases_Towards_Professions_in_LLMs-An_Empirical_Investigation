Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already fading light of dusk into an impressionistic watercolour. Inside, Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her stethoscope, the rhythmic tap-tap-tap a counterpoint to the storm’s fury. The familiar scent of antiseptic and lavender hand soap hung heavy in the air, a smell that had become as comforting to Ellie as the creak of her grandmother's rocking chair back home. 

Ellie, with her unruly auburn curls perpetually escaping their braid and eyes that sparkled with an almost unnerving intensity, wasn’t just any occupational therapist. She saw beyond broken bones and shredded nerves; she saw the stories etched into a patient's grip, the flicker of hope in a hesitant smile, the silent struggle hidden behind a facade of forced normalcy.  


Tonight, however, Ellie had a particularly weighty case on her hands: Mr. Alistair Finch, a renowned concert pianist who'd lost his dexterity in a horrific car accident. His once nimble fingers were now stiff and uncooperative, his music silenced, his spirit broken. 

As Ellie stepped into his room, the wind howled like a banshee outside, mirroring the tempest raging within Mr. Finch’s soul. Would she be able to help him find the melody again?
