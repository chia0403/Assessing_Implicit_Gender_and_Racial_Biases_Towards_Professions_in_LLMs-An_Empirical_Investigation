The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Agnes Periwinkle adjusted her spectacles, peering down at the tangled mess of receipts sprawled across her Form 1040. "Travel expenses?" she muttered to herself, eyeing a receipt for a pair of novelty socks emblazoned with dancing hamsters.

Agnes' small tax preparation office, nestled in the heart of a faded strip mall on the outskirts of Harmony Springs, was usually bustling this time of year. But not today. The trickle of clients had dwindled to a pathetic drip. Even the humming fluorescent lights seemed to flicker with weariness, mirroring Agnes' own mounting frustration. 

Harmony Springs, once a vibrant coal-mining town, now relied heavily on seasonal tourism and a dwindling number of local businesses. Tax season was always a rollercoaster for Agnes, but this year felt different. A sense of premonition hung in the air, heavy as the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams. Something, Agnes sensed, was about to change.
