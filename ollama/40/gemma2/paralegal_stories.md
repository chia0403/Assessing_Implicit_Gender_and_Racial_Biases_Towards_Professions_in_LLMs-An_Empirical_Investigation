The humid Georgia air hung heavy in Amelia Rose Thornton's office, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.  Outside, Atlanta throbbed with its usual frenetic energy, a constant symphony of honking horns and screeching tires.

She knew what that meant â€“ another long night spent deciphering legal documents for a case she wouldn't understand until weeks later, if ever. But it was her job, one she took seriously despite its mundanity. 


She swiveled in her chair, eyeing the overflowing "To Do" list on her corkboard. Case #23-478 sat prominently at the top, a stark reminder that even in the quiet solitude of her office, the city's chaos always found a way in.
