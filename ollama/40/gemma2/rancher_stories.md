The sun beat down on Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Cartwright's neck as she surveyed her herd. A thousand head of Angus grazed across the sprawling Kansas plains, their black coats shimmering in the heat haze. Her boots crunched on the parched earth, kicking up dust devils that danced around her legs like miniature tornadoes. The air was thick with the scent of sagebrush and the low mooing of cattle.

Ellie squinted at the horizon, a line blurring between the endless sky and the rolling plains. It stretched as far as she could see, painted in hues of burnt orange and dusty rose.  A hawk circled overhead, its piercing cry echoing across the vast emptiness. Ellie sighed, a long, weary exhale that mirrored the dryness of the land. This was her life - hard, unforgiving, beautiful. The Cartwright Ranch had been in her family for generations, and she wouldn't trade it for anything in the world, even if the drought threatened to swallow them whole.
