The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of gleaming chrome instruments. The air was thick with the antiseptic tang of mouthwash and the faintest hint of something vaguely sweet - probably the cinnamon-flavored toothpaste Amelia 'Amy' Rosewater used to brush her own teeth every morning before work.

It wasn't glamorous, this life she led as a dental hygienist in Dr. Miller's bustling practice nestled on Maple Street. But Amy found a quiet satisfaction in it.  She saw a different side of people here, stripped bare of their social masks and forced to confront the vulnerability of their pearly whites. 

Today, however, something felt different. The usual morning buzz was muted, replaced by an air of tension that crackled beneath the surface like static electricity. A new patient file lay open on her tray, a name she'd never seen before: Silas Blackwood. Something about the sharp, angular lines of his photo and the haunted look in his eyes sent a shiver down Amy's spine. This was no ordinary cleaning appointment.
