Professor Amelia "Amy" Everhart adjusted her spectacles, peering down at the dusty manuscript in front of her. The scent of aged paper and leather filled her tiny office in the university's forgotten wing, a comforting aroma that had become synonymous with years of scholarly pursuit. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the already dim cityscape outside into an impressionist watercolour.

But as Amy traced the faded ink with her gloved finger, a gnawing doubt began to take root. Was she chasing a phantom, a mere legend whispered through time?
