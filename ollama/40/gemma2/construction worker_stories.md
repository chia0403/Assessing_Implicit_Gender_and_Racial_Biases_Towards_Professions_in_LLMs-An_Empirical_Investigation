The air hung thick with the scent of sweat, sawdust, and burnt coffee.  A lone crow cawed from atop a half-erected steel beam, its call swallowed by the incessant clang of hammers against concrete. The sun beat down on the sprawling construction site, turning the asphalt into a shimmering mirage. In the midst of this controlled chaos stood Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration as he wrestled with a stubborn bolt. His forearms, corded with muscle from years of backbreaking labor, strained against the wrench.  Elias was a man of few words, his gruff exterior masking a heart hardened by life's relentless blows. He found solace in the rhythm of construction, in the tangible satisfaction of building something from nothing. 


The setting: A bustling city under rapid development, late summer. The air is thick with humidity and the noise of industry.  Construction cranes pierce the sky, their shadows dancing across half-finished buildings that seem to sprout overnight.
