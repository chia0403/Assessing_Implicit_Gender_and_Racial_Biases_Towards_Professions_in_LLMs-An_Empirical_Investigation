The morning mist clung to Rosalind Emberly's wellies as she traversed the dew-laden cobblestone path towards the grand iron gates of Blackwood Manor. A symphony of bird calls echoed through the ancient oaks that lined the drive, their leaves trembling in the nascent breeze. Dawn was barely breaking, painting the sky in hues of lavender and rose, but Rosalind, her weathered face creased with a smile, was already at work. 

For twenty years, she had been the sole caretaker of Blackwood Manor's menagerie â€“ a collection of rescued and cherished creatures that ranged from the majestic to the mundane.  From orphaned owls to skittish hedgehogs, boisterous baboons to a rather cantankerous tortoise named Bartholomew, Rosalind knew them all by name, tending to their every need with a quiet competence born from years of dedicated love. 


Today, however, felt different. A prickling anticipation buzzed beneath Rosalind's calm exterior. This morning, a special delivery was expected - a mystery creature, shrouded in rumour and whispered legend. Rosalind couldn't wait to meet her newest charge.
