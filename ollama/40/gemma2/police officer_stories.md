Rain lashed against the windshield of Detective Isabelle "Izzy" Moreau's cruiser, blurring the neon signs of the Vieux-Port into an abstract kaleidoscope of color. The air was thick with the smell of salt and diesel, punctuated by the occasional burst of acrid smoke from someone's illicit cigarette. 

The cobblestone streets were slick and treacherous underfoot, reflecting the dim streetlights in a shimmering dance. The waterfront district of Quebec City throbbed with a nocturnal energy that always both fascinated and unsettled Izzy. It was a place where shadows danced longer than they should, and secrets whispered on the wind. Tonight, those whispers felt particularly ominous. 


Izzy pulled up to the cordoned-off area, the red and white police tape flapping in the wind like a morbid banner.  A lone officer stood guard, his face obscured by the brim of his hat as he stared down at something on the ground. Izzy knew, even before she got out of the car, that this wasn't just another drunk-and-disorderly call.
