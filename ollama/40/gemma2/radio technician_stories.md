The humid Georgia air hung thick around Silas Blackwood like a damp blanket as he knelt beside the sputtering CB radio.  Cicadas thrummed their incessant song in the tall pines flanking his ramshackle workshop on the edge of Savannah's outskirts. A rusted sign, barely legible through years of sun and salt spray, proclaimed "Blackwood Radio Repair - We Fix What Ya Broke!" 

Silas, a man whose weathered face mirrored the age of the equipment he cherished, squinted at the tangle of wires within the boxy radio. His calloused fingers, stained with grease and graphite, traced the path of a frayed connection. He muttered curses under his breath, not entirely aimed at the malfunctioning device. The oppressive heat was sapping his energy, and the impending hurricane – Hurricane Hazel, they called it, a name that sent shivers down his spine – promised only more misery.  

He needed to fix this radio. It belonged to Old Man Jenkins, a crusty fisherman who relied on the CB to stay in contact with his crew during storms. A storm like Hazel could be brutal, churning the calm waters of the Georgia coast into a maelstrom. Silas owed it to Jenkins, and to himself, to get that radio working before the wind howled its fury.
