The air in The Gilded Cage, a dimly lit speakeasy tucked away on Wall Street's seedier side, crackled with hushed conversations and the clinking of glasses.  Smoke hung thick as a shroud, obscuring the faces of men hunched over mahogany tables, their eyes darting between poker hands and the ticker tape scrolling across a dusty wall projector.

Here, amongst the whispers of fortunes won and lost, sat Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood, his tailored suit rumpled, tie loosened. His usually sharp blue eyes were glazed with fatigue, reflecting the flickering neon sign outside advertising "Gin & Gamblers." A half-empty glass of amber liquid sweated on the table before him.

The ticker tape announced another dip in the market, sending a ripple of discontent through the room. Teddy, however, barely noticed. His mind was elsewhere, consumed by the memory of his father's words: "Son, Wall Street is a jungle. Only the cunning and ruthless survive."


He needed a win. A big one.  His recent string of bad calls had left him teetering on the edge, facing not only professional ruin but the scornful judgement of his family name. The Blackwoods were legends in the financial world, their legacy built on shrewd investments and unwavering ambition. 

Teddy, though, seemed to have inherited none of that fire.
