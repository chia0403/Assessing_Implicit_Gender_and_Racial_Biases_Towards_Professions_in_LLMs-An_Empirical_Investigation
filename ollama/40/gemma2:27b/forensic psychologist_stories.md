Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Moreau's office, mimicking the tempest raging inside her. Papers, scattered like fallen leaves across her desk, documented the gruesome details of the case: the mutilated body found in the alleyway behind the burlesque club, the cryptic note clutched in the victim's hand. 

Evelyn traced the jagged lines of the note with a trembling finger. The killer had left a message, a taunting riddle woven into a tapestry of violence. It was her job to unravel it, to delve into the mind of the perpetrator and predict their next move.  

The flickering neon sign of the "Scarlet Siren" cast an unsettling glow onto the rain-slicked cobblestones outside. Evelyn knew this case wouldn't be easy. The victim, a charismatic performer known as Ruby Rouge, had a tangled past full of secrets.  Evelyn needed to untangle those threads, decipher the killer's motives, and ultimately stop them before another life was extinguished. 

But first, she needed coffee. Strong. Black. Enough to wake the dead. And maybe, just maybe, enough to face the darkness swirling within this case, and within her own soul.
