The flickering neon sign of "Sammy's Surplus" cast an sickly green glow across Penelope Amelia Cartwright's tired face.  Penelope hated this time of night. The shadows stretched long and thin in the alley behind the shop, making every rustle of wind sound like footsteps. But Sammy had insisted on this late-night meeting, claiming his best deals were made under the cover of darkness. 

Penelope adjusted her itchy polyester blazer and sighed. Tonight's pitch was for a shipment of "vintage" camping gear - mostly dented kerosene lamps and moth-eaten sleeping bags, she suspected. Sammy had a knack for finding junk and calling it treasure. Her job was to convince someone, anyone, to buy it.

The air hung thick with the scent of mildew and burnt rubber from nearby tires. Penelope peered into the dimly lit alleyway, trying to make out Sammy's figure. A sudden clang startled her, followed by a guttural bark. Penelope jumped, clutching her briefcase tighter. This wasn't exactly in the sales manual.
