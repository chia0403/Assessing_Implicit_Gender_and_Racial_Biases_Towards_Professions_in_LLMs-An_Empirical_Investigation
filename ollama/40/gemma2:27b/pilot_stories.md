Rain lashed against the cockpit window, obscuring the distant lights of Anchorage like fireflies swallowed by a storm cloud. Amelia "Ace" Hawthorne wrestled with the Cessna 172, fighting to keep it level as turbulence bucked her around. The engine sputtered, coughed, and then roared back to life, its familiar growl a reassuring counterpoint to the howling wind outside. Ace gripped the yoke tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather.

Below her, the Alaskan wilderness stretched out in an endless tapestry of dark green spruce and black, churning rivers. She was miles from civilization, her radio crackling with static, the only company the insistent drumming of rain. Ace had been flying for years, logging countless hours over treacherous mountain passes and icy tundras, but this storm felt different. It hummed with a primal energy, a sense of unseen forces at play.
