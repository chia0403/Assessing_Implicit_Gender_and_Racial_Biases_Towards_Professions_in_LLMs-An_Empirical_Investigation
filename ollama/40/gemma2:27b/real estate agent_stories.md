Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already fading twilight into an impressionist painting. Eleanor Vance, her auburn hair plastered to her forehead, gripped the steering wheel tighter. The GPS chirped insistently about a "right turn in 200 feet," but Eleanor knew better. The crumbling dirt road ahead was barely wide enough for one car, let alone the SUV she was driving.

She sighed, pushing down the rising tide of frustration. This wasn't exactly the glamorous world of multi-million dollar beachfront properties she had envisioned when she first got her real estate license. But then again, the dilapidated Victorian mansion perched precariously on the cliffside overlooking the churning sea wasn't exactly your average listing either.

Eleanor was in Blackwood Cove, a remote coastal town shrouded in whispers and tinged with an unsettling stillness.  The "Seahaven Estate," as the property was morbidly named, had been vacant for decades, its former glory now consumed by creeping vines and peeling paint. It promised breathtaking views and whispered of untold secrets, but Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. The silence felt oppressive, broken only by the relentless rain and the mournful cry of gulls circling overhead.
