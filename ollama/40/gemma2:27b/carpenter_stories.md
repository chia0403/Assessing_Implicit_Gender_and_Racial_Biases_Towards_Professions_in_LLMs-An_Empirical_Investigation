The scent of sawdust and linseed oil hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Thornewood. Sunlight, filtered through dusty panes in the attic workshop, illuminated swirling motes dancing around his workbench. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh hummed with life â€“ the clanging of trams, vendors hawking their wares, snippets of laughter carried on the brisk autumn wind.

But Elias was oblivious to the world beyond his wood and tools. He ran a calloused thumb along the smooth grain of an antique oak chest he was restoring, its intricate carvings whispering stories of forgotten times. This piece, more than any other, held him captive. The weight of history, etched into every curve and corner, resonated within him like a long-forgotten melody.
