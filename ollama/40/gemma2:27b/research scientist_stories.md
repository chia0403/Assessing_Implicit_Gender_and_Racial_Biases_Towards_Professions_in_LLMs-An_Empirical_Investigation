Rain lashed against the laboratory windowpanes, mimicking the drumming anxiety in Dr. Eleanor Vance's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an eerie glow on the rows of vials filled with shimmering, iridescent liquid. Each vial contained a potential cure, a beacon of hope in the face of the encroaching Crimson Plague. For years, Eleanor had poured her life into this research, driven by a burning desire to save humanity from the devastating disease that was slowly turning its victims into mindless husks.

But tonight felt different.  Tonight, after countless failed attempts and dead ends, Eleanor held something promising in her gloved hands - a vial labeled "Subject 42". The iridescent liquid within pulsed with an ethereal light, unlike anything she'd seen before. Her heart pounded as she carefully injected the solution into a test subject, a lab rat named Kepler, whose fur was already beginning to dull and lose its luster due to the early stages of the plague.
