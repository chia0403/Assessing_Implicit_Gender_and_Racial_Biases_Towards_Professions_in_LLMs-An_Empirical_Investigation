The Parisian sun dripped like honey onto the cobblestones of Rue de la Harpe, warming Elodie Beaumont's face as she adjusted her beret. Around her, the scent of freshly baked croissants mingled with the musky aroma of ancient stone. Elodie loved this time of day â€“ the quiet hum before the city awoke and swallowed them all whole.

Today was different. Today, she wasn't guiding the usual gaggle of wide-eyed tourists through Notre Dame or the Louvre. Today, her client was a solitary figure shrouded in mystery: a man who called himself Alistair Thorne, with eyes as grey as the Seine after a storm and a voice that rumbled like distant thunder. He had requested a private tour, not of the famed landmarks, but of the hidden corners, the forgotten alleyways, the whispers of Parisian history echoing beneath the polished veneer.

Elodie felt a shiver crawl down her spine. This wasn't the usual tourist fare, and Alistair Thorne was far from your average visitor. What secrets did he seek in the heart of this ancient city?
