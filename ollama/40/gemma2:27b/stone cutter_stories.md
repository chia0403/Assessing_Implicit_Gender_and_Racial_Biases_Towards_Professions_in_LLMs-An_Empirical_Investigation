The rasping whine of flint on granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, punctuated by the rhythmic thud of Bartholomew Quill's mallet. Dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight that pierced through the grimy windowpane, illuminating the sweat beaded on Bartholomew's forehead and the calloused ridges carved into his hands. 

His current project, a gargantuan angel for the cathedral spire, lay half-finished before him. Its wings were still rough hewn, the delicate feathers awaiting their intricate carving. But Bartholomew was distracted. He wasn’t thinking about angels or spires. His mind was filled with a swirling storm of doubt and anticipation.

The messenger had arrived that morning, bearing a sealed letter embossed with the royal crest. It promised an opportunity, a chance to leave his dusty workshop in Stonehaven and ply his trade in the opulent court of King Eldred himself. Bartholomew’s heart yearned for the challenge, for the chance to create something truly magnificent. Yet, fear gnawed at him: what if he wasn't good enough? What if he failed under the king's discerning eye?

He picked up a chisel, its handle worn smooth from years of use. The stone beneath his fingers felt familiar, comforting. This was his world – the smell of dust and granite, the clanging rhythm of tools, the slow, deliberate dance of creation. But could he leave it all behind for something unknown?
