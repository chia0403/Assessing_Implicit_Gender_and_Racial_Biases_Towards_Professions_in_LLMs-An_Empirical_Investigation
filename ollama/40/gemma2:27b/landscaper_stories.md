The morning mist clung to Amelia Blackwood's overalls like a damp embrace as she surveyed her latest project: the sprawling lawn of Blackwood Manor, an imposing Victorian mansion perched atop a windswept hill overlooking the rugged Cornish coastline. Salt spray tickled her nose and the cries of gulls mingled with the rhythmic clang of her trowel against stone as she meticulously laid a path of weathered granite through the tangled wildflower meadow. Amelia's calloused hands, stained green from countless hours spent coaxing life from the earth, moved with an instinctive grace honed over years of tending to nature's capricious whims. Today, however, the familiar serenity of her work was punctuated by a sense of unease, a prickling awareness that she was being watched.

Blackwood Manor, shrouded in whispers and local lore, had been vacant for decades. Its windows, dark and lifeless like empty sockets, stared down at Amelia with an unsettling intensity. The overgrown gardens, once renowned for their vibrant beauty, were now a tangle of thorns and forgotten blooms, hinting at past glories and whispered secrets.
