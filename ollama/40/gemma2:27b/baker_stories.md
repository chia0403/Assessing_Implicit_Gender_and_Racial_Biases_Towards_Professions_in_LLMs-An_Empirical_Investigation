The aroma of caramelized sugar and warm yeast hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eliza Rosewater's apron like a comforting second skin. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Lavender Lane were slick with morning rain, reflecting the pastel hues of the shop fronts. But inside "Eliza's Delights," a cozy haven of warmth emanated from the ancient brick oven, beckoning customers in with promises of freshly baked bread and delicate pastries. Eliza, her freckled nose dusted with flour and her auburn braid escaping its ribbon tie, hummed a cheerful tune as she expertly kneaded dough, her strong hands moving with the practiced grace of years spent shaping sweet dreams into edible realities. 


Today was market day, and Eliza was preparing for the influx of hungry customers who'd flock to her stall, eager for a taste of her legendary lavender scones and honey-glazed croissants. But as she glanced out the window at the gathering storm clouds, a flicker of unease touched her normally sunny disposition.  Something felt different today, an unsettling tension in the air that even the sweetest pastry couldn't dispel.
