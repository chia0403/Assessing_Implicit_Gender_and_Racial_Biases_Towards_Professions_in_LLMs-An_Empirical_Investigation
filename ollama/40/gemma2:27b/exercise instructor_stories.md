The humid Charleston air clung to Seraphina "Sera" Bellweather like a second skin as she surveyed her outdoor fitness class. Sunlight glinted off the Ashley River, painting the shimmering surface gold. Palmetto trees swayed gently in the breeze, their fronds casting dappled shadows on the cobblestone pathway where her clients were assembling.  

Sera inhaled deeply, the scent of magnolia blossoms mingling with the salty tang of the harbor. A smile spread across her face. Charleston was her haven, a place where history whispered through the streets and vibrant life pulsed beneath the surface. And today, she was going to share that energy with her students.
