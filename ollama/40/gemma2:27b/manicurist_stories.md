The flickering neon sign outside "Nails by Natalie" buzzed with an erratic energy, mirroring the thrumming anxiety in Natalie Odette Dubois' chest. It was 7:58pm – two minutes until closing – and the shop remained eerily empty. Usually, Thursdays were her busiest night, a flurry of working women needing pre-weekend pampering. But tonight, the silence stretched, thick and heavy like gel polish drying under a UV lamp.

Natalie glanced at the reflection staring back from the mirrored wall behind her station. Her usually vibrant red lipstick was smudged, betraying her gnawing unease. The scent of lavender cuticle oil mingled with the faint metallic tang of fear, creating an unsettling aroma unique to this disconcerting night.  Was it just a slow night, or was something else amiss?
