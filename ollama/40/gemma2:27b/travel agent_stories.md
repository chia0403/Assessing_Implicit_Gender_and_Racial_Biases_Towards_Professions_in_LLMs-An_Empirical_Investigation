The air conditioner wheezed its last breath, spewing forth lukewarm air into Amelia Thistlewick's already sweltering office. It was a Tuesday, but it felt like a Saturday afternoon in July - thick and sticky with anticipation. Outside, the bustling streets of Soho hummed with life, a stark contrast to the hushed desperation settling over Amelia's cubicle. 

Amelia, her auburn curls escaping their usual bun, tapped a manicured fingernail against her desk, staring at the email on her screen. It was from Mrs. Hawthorne, a repeat client known for her extravagant taste and even more extravagant budget. "Something unexpected has come up, dear Amelia," it read. "The Amalfi Coast is no longer appealing. I've decided on Bhutan instead." 

Amelia groaned inwardly. Bhutan? The Land of the Thunder Dragon was not exactly a walk in the park. It required meticulous planning, intricate visa applications, and an understanding of Buddhist culture that extended beyond ordering vegetarian Pad Thai.  She glanced at the overflowing inbox – honeymooners to Santorini, families to Disney World, a solo traveler yearning for Machu Picchu – each request demanding her immediate attention. Bhutan, however, felt like an entirely different beast.
