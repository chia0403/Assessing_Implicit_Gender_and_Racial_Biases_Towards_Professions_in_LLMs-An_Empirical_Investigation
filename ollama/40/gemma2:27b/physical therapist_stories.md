The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and desperation. Amelia Rose Thornton adjusted her glasses, pushing back a stray curl that threatened to fall into her eyes. The fluorescent lights above hummed their monotonous tune, casting a sterile glow on the cramped gymnasium at Hopewell Rehabilitation Center. Outside, a late autumn rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the storm brewing within Amelia.

Hopewell was supposed to be her fresh start, a chance to escape the cutthroat world of private practice and reconnect with her passion for healing. But lately, it felt more like a holding cell, trapping her in a cycle of repetitive exercises and unfulfilled potential. 


Today, however, promised to be different. Amelia was scheduled to meet her newest patient, a young man who had suffered a devastating spinal cord injury in a car accident. The reports were vague, mentioning limited mobility and a flicker of hope for regaining some sensation.

As Amelia approached the curtained-off section of the gym, her heart pounded with a mixture of anticipation and trepidation. This was more than just another patient; this was a chance to make a real difference, to defy the odds and restore a life shattered by tragedy.
