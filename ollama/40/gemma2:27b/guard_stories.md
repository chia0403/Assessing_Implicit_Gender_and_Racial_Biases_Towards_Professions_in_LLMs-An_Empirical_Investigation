Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. Elias Thorne, his face etched with weariness and worry, peered through the smeared glass. The jagged peaks of the Dragonbone Mountains loomed above the village of Grimhaven, shrouded in an ominous veil of mist and shadow.

Elias had been a guard for ten years, ever since he was barely a man. He knew every cobblestone path, every crooked roofline, and every weary face in Grimhaven. But tonight, something felt different. The wind carried whispers through the eaves â€“ tales of strange lights seen on the mountainside, of unsettling growls echoing in the night. The villagers, usually so hardy and resilient, huddled indoors with fear gnawing at their hearts. 


Elias shifted his weight, the cold steel of his sword hilt pressing against his thigh. He had a duty to protect Grimhaven, but tonight, he couldn't shake the feeling that something wicked was stirring in the mountains. Something ancient and hungry.
