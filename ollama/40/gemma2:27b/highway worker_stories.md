The sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's neck, turning the collar of his orange vest into a branding iron. Sweat trickled down his temples, stinging his eyes as he swung the jackhammer. The rhythmic clang echoed off the asphalt, blending with the symphony of honking horns and rumbling engines that was the soundtrack to Eli's life. He was repairing a section of Interstate 80 that had buckled under the relentless summer heat, a task seemingly as endless as the highway itself.

Dust billowed around him in thick clouds, coating everything in a fine layer of grime. His muscles screamed with protest, but he pushed on, driven by the knowledge that countless commuters were counting on him to get their precious asphalt artery flowing again. 


Eli glanced at the clock strapped to his wrist â€“ 10:32 am. Just a few more hours until lunch. He imagined himself sinking his teeth into a juicy burger and washing it down with an ice-cold lemonade, dreaming of the day he could trade this dusty roadside for something a little less...intense.
