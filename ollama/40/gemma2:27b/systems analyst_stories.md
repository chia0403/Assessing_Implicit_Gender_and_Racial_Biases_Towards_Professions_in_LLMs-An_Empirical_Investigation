Rain lashed against the panoramic window of Amelia Rose Cartwright's office, blurring the glittering skyline into an impressionistic painting of light and shadow.  The incessant drumming intensified her headache, already throbbing from hours spent staring at lines of code. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, hesitating before plunging back into the labyrinthine depths of the hospital's patient database.

Amelia was a systems analyst for St. Jude's Hospital, a sprawling complex dedicated to cutting-edge medical research and treatment.  Her job: to ensure the smooth functioning of the technological arteries that kept this behemoth alive. Tonight, however, those arteries felt clogged, her code stubbornly refusing to cooperate. She sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair from her forehead, frustration etching lines around her hazel eyes.

The blinking cursor on the screen mocked her with its unwavering persistence. Amelia knew she should call it a night, but a nagging sense of urgency kept her glued to her chair. Something felt off, a glitch in the matrix that whispered of a deeper problem lurking beneath the surface.
