The sun beat down on Jericho "Jerry" Callahan's weathered neck as he surveyed his land. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, kicking up red dirt that stung his eyes. The air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the promise of another brutal summer.  His ranch, the Broken Spur, had seen better days. Drought had gripped their corner of Wyoming for months, turning lush pastures into brittle scrubland. Jerry squinted at the skeletal remains of a cottonwood tree, its once-proud branches now reaching towards the unforgiving sky like pleading arms. 

He sighed, the sound lost in the relentless wind.  A lifetime on this land had taught him to read the subtle signs, the whispers of nature that foretold both bounty and hardship. This year, those whispers spoke of struggle. His cattle were losing weight, their ribs stark against their dusty hides. The creek that once flowed freely through his property was now a trickle, barely enough to sustain the thirsty wildlife.

Jerry knew he couldn't afford another season like this. He needed rain. Desperately.
