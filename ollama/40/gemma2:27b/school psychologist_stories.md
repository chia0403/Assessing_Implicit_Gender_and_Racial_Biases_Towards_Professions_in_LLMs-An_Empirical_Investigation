Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, mimicking the tempest brewing within her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn leather chairs and stacks of paperwork threatening to engulf her desk. Outside, the late October wind howled, whipping fallen leaves into frenzied dances across the asphalt playground.

Evelyn, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun that strained against stray wisps framing her freckled face, stared at the file before her.  "Ethan Pierce," it read in bold, black lettering. The accompanying photograph showed a boy barely old enough for middle school, his eyes downcast and guarded, a haunted look clinging to his youthful features.

She sighed, pushing away the file and rubbing tired circles into her temples. Ethan was just one of many troubled souls seeking refuge within the walls of Willow Creek Middle School.  Evelyn had dedicated her career to helping these children navigate the treacherous waters of adolescence, but lately, it felt like she was merely bailing out a sinking ship with a teaspoon.

Today, however, felt different. Ethan's case resonated with a chilling familiarity, stirring a dormant fear deep within her. There was something about his haunted eyes, the way he clutched his worn teddy bear even during daylight hours, that whispered of a darkness far deeper than teenage angst.
