Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the space. Amelia Thistlewick, her worn wellies squelching on the damp concrete floor, hummed softly as she shuffled between cages, her breath misting in the cool air.  The scent of hay mingled with the musky tang of animal fur, a comforting aroma that always calmed her frazzled nerves. Tonight, however, Amelia's usual serenity was tinged with worry. 

Her sanctuary, nestled on the outskirts of sleepy Ashton Hollow, housed an eclectic menagerie: rescued farm animals, abandoned pets, and even the occasional injured wild creature. But tonight, it was a new arrival that gnawed at her mind - a scrawny, shivering greyhound found cowering under a dripping bush. 

His ribs were visible beneath his matted fur, and his eyes held a haunted look Amelia couldn't decipher. She'd named him Ash, after the town where she'd found him, and tucked him into a warm corner of the barn with a bowl of water and a generous helping of kibble. But he wouldn't touch it, only trembling further as thunder rumbled in the distance.

Amelia paused by his cage, her heart heavy with concern. Ash needed more than food and shelter; he needed someone to understand his fear.  She crouched beside him, her voice soft and soothing. "It's alright, Ash," she murmured, gently stroking his bony head. "You're safe now."
