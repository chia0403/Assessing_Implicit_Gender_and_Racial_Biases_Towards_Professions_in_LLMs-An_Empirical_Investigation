Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street.  Acrid smoke from cheap cigarettes curled towards the cracked ceiling, mingling with the scent of stale beer and desperation that permeated The Blue Moon Diner. Eleanor Vance, a reporter for the struggling "City Chronicle," hunched over her lukewarm coffee, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across her face. She was fresh out of journalism school, hungry for a story, and drowning in unpaid student loans.

Eleanor had been chasing this lead for weeks - whispers of a clandestine gambling ring operating out of Chinatown, protected by someone with deep pockets and even deeper connections. The Blue Moon was her last hope, a greasy spoon known to be frequented by the city's underworld. Tonight, she felt like she was finally getting somewhere. 

A hulking figure with a scarred face and eyes that glittered like chips of obsidian slid onto the booth opposite Eleanor. His presence sent a shiver down her spine, but she forced herself to meet his gaze. He leaned in, his voice a gravelly rasp. "You lookin' for something?"
