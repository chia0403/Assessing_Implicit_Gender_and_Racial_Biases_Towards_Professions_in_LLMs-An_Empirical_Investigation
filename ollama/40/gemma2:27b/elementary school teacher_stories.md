The smell of chalk dust and overripe bananas hung heavy in Ms. Eloise Amelia Cartwright's third-grade classroom. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the air and turning the faded green chalkboard into a shimmering emerald. Eloise sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. It was 3:05 pm on a Friday – only five minutes until the chaotic symphony of dismissal would begin. She surveyed her students, their faces alight with the promise of freedom.

Little Timmy Johnson was already halfway out of his chair, bouncing on the balls of his feet like a popcorn kernel about to burst. Amelia Nguyen sat patiently at her desk, meticulously erasing her eraser marks with a determined frown. And then there was Leo Garcia, perched precariously on the edge of his seat, a mischievous glint in his eye as he whispered something unintelligible to his best friend, Daniel Ramirez.

Eloise knew this wasn't just any Friday; it was the last day before spring break. A week of unbridled freedom stretched before her students – a week filled with playgrounds, swimming pools, and late-night adventures fueled by sugary cereal. And while she was happy for them, a pang of longing twisted in Eloise's chest. Spring break always felt like an unwelcome reminder of her solitary life.
