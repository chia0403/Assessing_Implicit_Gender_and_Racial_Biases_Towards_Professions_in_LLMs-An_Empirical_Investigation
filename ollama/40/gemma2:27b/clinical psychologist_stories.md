The scent of jasmine tea hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint metallic tang emanating from Eleanor Finch's antique brass lamp. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her cozy office, creating a steady rhythm that mirrored the anxious beat of her patient's heart. Eleanor, whose silver hair was always perfectly coiffed and whose emerald green eyes held a depth of understanding rarely found outside novels, leaned forward in her plush armchair.

"Tell me about your dream, Amelia," she urged gently, her voice as soothing as the rain-washed world beyond the glass. "Every detail you can remember." 


Amelia nervously twisted a strand of auburn hair around her finger, her gaze darting across the room before settling on Eleanor's comforting face. "It was...dark," she stammered, her voice barely above a whisper. "And there was this feeling, like I was being watched..."

The scene: Eleanor Finch's psychology practice, nestled in a quiet, tree-lined neighborhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The office is dimly lit, with warm wood paneling and bookshelves overflowing with well-worn tomes on psychoanalysis and human behavior. A crackling fire casts dancing shadows across the Persian rug. Outside, a storm rages, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Amelia's mind.
