The mahogany bench creaked under Amelia Rosalind Cartwright's weight as she leaned forward, her gaze fixed on the defendant trembling before her. The courtroom, usually a space humming with hushed anticipation, was unnervingly silent. Sunlight streamed through the stained glass windows, painting dappled patterns across the worn oak floor, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. Outside, the city of Everbright thrummed with its usual Friday afternoon bustle, but within these walls, time seemed to have stopped. Amelia, known for her sharp intellect and unwavering sense of justice, felt a pang of unease she couldn't quite place. This case, involving a seemingly simple theft, had an unsettling undercurrent that tugged at her intuition.  

Something wasn't right.
