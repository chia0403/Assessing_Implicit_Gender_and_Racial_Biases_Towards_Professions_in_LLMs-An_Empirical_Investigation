The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, doing little to mask the acrid tang of anxiety that permeated Amelia Rose Hawthorne's small treatment room. Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on the quaint New England town of Havenwood, turning the usually charming brick sidewalks into shimmering mirages.  

Amelia kneaded her aching thumbs, glancing at the clock. Mrs. Eleanor Prescott was already fifteen minutes late. This wasn't unusual for the elderly widow; she often arrived flustered, muttering about misplaced keys or a lost cat named Mittens. Still, Amelia couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease. Something felt off. The usual gentle rustle of Mrs. Prescott's arrival - the jingling of her silver bangles and the soft thud of her walker - was absent. 

Amelia rose, smoothing down her crisp white tunic. Perhaps she should call to check if everything was alright. Just then, a sharp rapping on the windowpane startled her. Amelia turned, heart pounding, to see Mrs. Prescott's face pressed against the glass, eyes wide with terror.
