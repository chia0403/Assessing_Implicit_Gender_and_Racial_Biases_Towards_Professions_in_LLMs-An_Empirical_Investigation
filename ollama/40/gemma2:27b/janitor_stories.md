The fluorescent lights hummed above Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the linoleum floors of the Grand Blackwood Library. Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated like tiny stars against the backdrop of endless shelves crammed with ancient tomes. Bart pushed his battered cleaning cart down the silent aisle, the squeak of its wheels echoing through the cavernous space.

The library was closed for the night, a sanctuary only to Bart and the ghosts of countless whispered stories trapped within the brittle pages. He knew every corner, every creak of the floorboards, every secret passage hidden behind towering stacks of forgotten literature.  Tonight, though, something felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, thick as the dust he was diligently wiping away.

Bart paused, listening intently. The only sound was the rhythmic thump of his own heart. Then, a faint scraping noise from deep within the library's bowels sent a shiver down his spine.
