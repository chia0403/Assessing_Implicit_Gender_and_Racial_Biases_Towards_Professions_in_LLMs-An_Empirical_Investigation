Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the clinic, each drop a staccato beat in Amelia "Amy" Reyes' already frantic heart. The power had flickered out minutes ago, plunging the single room into an unnerving twilight. A kerosene lamp sputtered on the makeshift table, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the anxious faces huddled around her.

The storm had rolled in with terrifying speed, trapping Amy and a handful of villagers inside the dilapidated clinic perched precariously on the edge of the Rio Negro rainforest. The air hung thick and heavy, pregnant with the scent of damp earth and decaying vegetation, punctuated by the guttural croaks of unseen frogs. 


Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the flimsy walls and threatening to rip the clinic from its moorings.  Amy, despite her years of training as a physician's assistant, felt a surge of primal fear. She was alone, miles from any other medical help, responsible for the lives huddled around her: a young mother with a feverish child, an elderly man with a hacking cough, and a fisherman whose hand had been mangled by a rogue fishing hook. 

As another deafening clap of thunder echoed through the jungle, Amy steeled herself. She was all they had.
