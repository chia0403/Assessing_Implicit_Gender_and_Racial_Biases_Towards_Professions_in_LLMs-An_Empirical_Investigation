Rain lashed against the windows of the St. Sybil's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already grey cityscape outside. Eleanor Ainsworth, her salt-and-pepper braid escaping its bun, sighed as she surveyed the empty therapy room. The rhythmic clatter of the rain mirrored the dull ache in her chest - a constant companion since her own accident three years ago.  

Today was supposed to be different. Today, a new patient was arriving: Lucas Thorne, a young pianist who'd lost his right hand in a motorcycle accident. Eleanor had spent weeks poring over his file, picturing the frustration and despair he must be feeling. She wanted to help him find hope again, not just regain function, but rediscover the passion that music ignited within him.  

But as the minutes ticked by and Lucas hadn't arrived, doubt began to creep in. Was he having second thoughts? Had the news of his limitations overwhelmed him? Eleanor pushed those thoughts aside, reminding herself that every journey towards healing was unique, and patience was key. She straightened the music sheets on the piano, their notes a silent promise waiting to be awakened.
