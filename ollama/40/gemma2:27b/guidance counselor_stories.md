Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of Ms. Amelia Cartwright's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her.  High school hallways usually pulsed with the chaotic energy of adolescence, but today, an eerie silence hung heavy in the air. The news had spread like wildfire - Principal Thompson's sudden heart attack during morning assembly.

Amelia stared at the worn stack of college application essays on her desk, their hopeful words now jarring against the grim reality.  She was supposed to be helping these kids navigate the future, but how could she guide them when the present felt so uncertain? The bell for third period echoed through the empty hallway, a stark reminder of the responsibility weighing down on her shoulders.

Amelia took a deep breath, straightened her cardigan, and reached for the phone. She needed to speak to the vice-principal, needed to know what was happening, needed to find some semblance of order in this unexpected storm.
