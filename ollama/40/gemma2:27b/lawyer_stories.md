Rain lashed against the frosted glass of Amelia Cartwright's office window, blurring the already dim cityscape beyond. The rhythmic drumming mirrored the insistent throb behind her eyes, a testament to the late nights and early mornings she'd poured into this case. Papers littered her mahogany desk, each page bearing witness to the tangled web of deceit woven by her client’s estranged brother.

Amelia sighed, massaging her temples with weary fingers. Her practice, tucked away in a quiet corner of Boston’s historic Beacon Hill, usually dealt with less dramatic affairs: contract disputes, inheritance squabbles, the occasional prenuptial agreement. But the case of Thomas Beaumont, accused of embezzling millions from his own family firm, was proving to be unlike anything she'd ever handled.

The weight of her client's fate pressed down on her. He wasn’t some cold-hearted tycoon; he was a kind, quiet man whose loyalty had been grotesquely exploited by his own flesh and blood. Amelia believed in him, saw the pain etched on his face when he spoke of his brother's betrayal. But proving Thomas' innocence was proving to be an uphill battle against formidable evidence.

Tonight, she needed answers. Answers that lay hidden within the labyrinthine financial records of Beaumont Enterprises. And Amelia Cartwright, armed with her legal acumen and an unwavering determination to see justice served, was prepared to delve into the darkness.
