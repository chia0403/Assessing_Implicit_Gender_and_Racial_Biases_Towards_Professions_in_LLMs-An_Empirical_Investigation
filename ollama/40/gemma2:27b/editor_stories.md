Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Amelia Cartwright's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Stacks of manuscripts threatened to topple from her desk, each one a potential literary gem or, more likely, another soul-crushing rejection waiting to happen. As senior editor at Blackwood & Sons, a once-prestigious publishing house now clinging to relevance by its fingernails, Amelia was drowning in a sea of mediocre prose. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and desperation. Amelia rubbed her tired eyes, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across her face. She longed for a story that would ignite her passion, something raw and powerful that would remind her why she'd chosen this career path in the first place. But today, hope felt as distant as the sun hidden behind the perpetual grayness of London.
