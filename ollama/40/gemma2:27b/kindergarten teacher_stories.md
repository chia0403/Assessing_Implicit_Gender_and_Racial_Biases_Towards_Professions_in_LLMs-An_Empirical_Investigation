The air hung thick with the scent of crayons and peanut butter sandwiches.  Sunbeams sliced through the dusty windows of Mrs. Penelope Ainsworth's kindergarten classroom, illuminating swirls of glitter glue on construction paper masterpieces and the brightly colored alphabet rug where twenty-five five-year-olds were engaged in a raucous rendition of "The Wheels on the Bus." Penelope smiled, her heart swelling with affection for these tiny humans whose world was filled with wonder and boundless imagination. Yet, beneath the surface of this idyllic scene, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.

But over the past week, the occurrences had grown increasingly strange and unsettling. Whispered voices seemed to drift from empty corners, toys moved seemingly on their own, and once, Penelope swore she saw a shadow flit across the chalkboard when no one else was in the room.

Penelope wasn't prone to superstition. She was a woman of logic and reason, but these incidents were chipping away at her composure, leaving behind a chilling doubt. Was there something else sharing her classroom with her and her students?
