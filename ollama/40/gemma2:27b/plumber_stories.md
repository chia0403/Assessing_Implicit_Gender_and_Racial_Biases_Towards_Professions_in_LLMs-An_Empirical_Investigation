The stench of week-old cabbage and something faintly metallic hung heavy in the air, clinging to Thaddeus "Teddy" Bartholomew like a persistent ex-girlfriend. Teddy grimaced, pinching his nose with one gloved hand while his other wrestled with the stubborn drainpipe beneath Mrs. O’Malley’s sink.  Her cluttered kitchen, crammed with porcelain cats and crocheted doilies, felt more like a hoarder's paradise than a place of culinary delights.  

Outside, a summer thunderstorm raged, unleashing torrents of rain that hammered against the windowpanes and rattled the teacups precariously perched on the counter. Teddy longed for the day he could trade in his wrenches and plungers for a fishing rod and a quiet lake. But for now, there were leaky pipes to be fixed, clogged toilets to be unclogged, and irate housewives like Mrs. O’Malley to appease.
