The pungent aroma of lavender and rosemary hung thick in the air, battling for supremacy with the sharper scent of peroxide. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cobblestone streets of Montmartre, but inside "Chez Colette," time seemed to stand still.

She paused, her gaze catching on the reflection in the ornate gold mirror â€“ a woman with eyes the color of moss and a mane of fiery red curls pulled back in a loose braid.

A shiver ran down Colette's spine, not from the chill that sometimes crept into the old salon despite its crackling fireplace, but from an unsettling premonition. Something was different today. The air crackled with a strange energy, punctuated by the insistent chiming of the shop bell. A new customer had arrived.
