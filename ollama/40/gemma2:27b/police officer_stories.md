Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Detective Inspector Elias "Eli" Thorne's office, each drop a tiny hammer blow driving him further into despair. The flickering neon sign outside cast grotesque shadows across his cluttered desk, highlighting the half-eaten sandwich and lukewarm coffee that stood testament to another sleepless night.  

Outside, the streets of Grimsborough were awash in a sickly yellow glow. A city perpetually cloaked in a haze of smog and secrets, it was a place where hope went to die. Eli knew this better than most. Ten years on the force had stripped away any illusions he might have once harbored about justice.

Today's case - the brutal murder of a young woman found strangled in an alleyway behind the Rusty Nail tavern - felt like just another drop in Grimsborough's overflowing cup of misery.
