The wind whipped across Ezra Blackwood's face, carrying with it the scent of dry earth and impending rain.  His calloused hands gripped the weathered wood of his plow handle tighter as he urged the oxen forward. The furrows they carved into the parched land stretched out before him like dark, jagged scars. 

Ezra squinted at the sky, a canvas bruised purple and grey with brewing storm clouds.  He'd hoped to get another row in before the rain hit, but it looked like that wouldn't be happening. He sighed, knowing he'd have to leave his precious crop vulnerable for now. The land had been unforgiving this year; drought had ravaged the fields, leaving stunted stalks and withered leaves in its wake.

He glanced towards his ramshackle farmhouse nestled against a backdrop of rolling hills, smoke curling lazily from its chimney.  His wife, Eleanor, would be waiting inside with a steaming mug of chamomile tea and a worried frown etched on her face. He knew she'd implore him to rest, but Ezra couldn't bear the thought of leaving his fields unattended, even for a moment. This harvest was everything to them; their livelihood, their future, hanging precariously in the balance.
