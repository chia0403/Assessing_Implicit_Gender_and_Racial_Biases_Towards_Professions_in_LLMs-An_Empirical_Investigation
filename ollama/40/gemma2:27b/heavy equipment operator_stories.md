The rusted sun bled across the horizon, casting long shadows from the hulking Caterpillar 349 excavator that sat dormant in the pre-dawn gloom. Silas Bartholomew “Bart” Higgins ran a calloused hand over its chipped paint, a familiar ache blossoming in his shoulder where he’d taken a spill last month. The mine was silent save for the distant chirping of crickets and the rhythmic clanging of Bart tightening bolts on the behemoth's arm.  

He wasn’t much for mornings, but the early shift paid better. Besides, there was something about being the first one to crack the earth open, to reveal the hidden treasures beneath the surface, that felt primal, satisfying. Today, they were digging deeper than usual, chasing a vein of copper rumored to be richer than any they’d found before. Bart hoped it was true. He needed the extra money – his daughter Lily's college tuition wouldn't pay itself.
