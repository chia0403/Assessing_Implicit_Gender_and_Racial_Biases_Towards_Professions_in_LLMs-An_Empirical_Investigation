Rain lashed against the arched windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the storm raging inside her own chest. The worn leather armchair across from her sat empty, a testament to the last-minute cancellation that had left Evelyn with an unexpected chasm in her afternoon schedule. It was a rare occurrence; Evelyn prided herself on creating a safe and comforting space for her clients, one where they felt empowered to share their deepest vulnerabilities. 

But today, she felt anything but safe. The news from this morning – the sudden disappearance of her childhood friend, Amelia – had left her reeling. Amelia, with her infectious laugh and unwavering optimism, vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a cold trail of unanswered questions. As Evelyn stared out at the grey cityscape shrouded in mist, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.  

The weight of her own unresolved childhood trauma pressed down on her, threatening to shatter the carefully constructed facade of calm she presented to her clients. Could Amelia be in danger? What if she had fallen victim to the same darkness Evelyn had fought so hard to escape? The questions echoed unanswered in the hushed silence of her office, urging Evelyn to take action, to delve into the unknown and confront her own demons in the process.
