The Grand Blackwood Hotel shimmered under a midday sun, its brass fixtures glinting like captured fireflies.  From his perch behind the mahogany bellhop stand, Theodore "Teddy" Finnigan watched the ceaseless tide of arrivals and departures, each guest a story waiting to unfold. He adjusted his maroon vest and smoothed down the creases in his uniform trousers – every detail mattered in this gilded cage. 

A sleek limousine pulled up to the porte-cochere, disgorging a woman draped in furs that looked as expensive as Teddy's annual salary. Her ruby lipstick curled into a disdainful frown as she surveyed the lobby with eyes the color of glacial ice.  This was no ordinary guest; Teddy could feel it in his bones. Today, he wouldn't just be fetching suitcases and hailing cabs – today, he might just be stepping into a story of his own.
