Rain lashed against the windows of "Critter Care," the neon sign flickering anemically in the storm's fury. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright, her auburn hair escaping its braid, scrubbed furiously at a stubborn bloodstain on her worn green scrubs. A sigh escaped her lips, mingling with the scent of antiseptic and disinfectant that permeated the small veterinary clinic. It was nearly midnight, the last stragglers from the day's influx of furry (and feathered) patients long gone, except for one – a scrawny, whimpering tabby huddled in the corner of an examination room.

Amelia had named him Stormy, a fitting name considering his arrival during the worst downpour she'd seen in years. He was riddled with fleas and barely clinging to life, his ribs stark beneath matted fur. A pang of sympathy echoed in Amelia's chest. She knew this feeling all too well – the desperate fight for survival against overwhelming odds.
