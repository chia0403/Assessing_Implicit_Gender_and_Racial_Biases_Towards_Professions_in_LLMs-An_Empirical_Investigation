Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a miniature hammer blow against the warped glass. Eleanor Ainsworth huddled deeper into her threadbare armchair, the worn fabric offering scant comfort against the chill seeping in from the eaves.  The single bare bulb dangling overhead cast long, dancing shadows across the cluttered room: stacks of yellowed manuscripts threatening to topple, overflowing inkwells staining the rickety table, and a battered typewriter perched precariously on a stool. 

Eleanor, her silver hair escaping its bun like wispy smoke, stared at the blank page in front of her. The cursor blinked accusingly, mocking her writer's block. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  She needed to finish this novel, her magnum opus, but the words refused to come.  It was as if the muse had abandoned her, leaving her stranded in a desolate wasteland of creativity.
