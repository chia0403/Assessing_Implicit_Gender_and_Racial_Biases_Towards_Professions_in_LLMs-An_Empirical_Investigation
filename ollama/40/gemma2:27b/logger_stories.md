The rusty groan of ancient metal echoed through the dense Oregon forest as Elias Blackwood wrestled the lever of his aging winch. Sunlight, fractured by a thousand emerald leaves, dappled the ground where moss clung to fallen logs like vibrant green fur. Sweat stung Elias's eyes, blurring the towering Douglas firs that surrounded him.

He wasn't a man built for finesse. Broad-shouldered and weathered, with hands calloused from years of wielding axes and chainsaws, Elias embodied the rugged spirit of the Pacific Northwest. Today, however, he felt the weight of his fifty years pressing down on him. The forest, once a sanctuary, now whispered warnings he couldn't ignore - whispers of aching joints, creaking bones, and the relentless march of time. 

He tugged harder at the winch, bringing the massive log closer to the waiting truck bed. This one was for Mrs. Henderson's fireplace – she always insisted on seasoned Douglas fir, claiming it burned hotter and smelled sweeter than any other wood. Elias smiled wryly. He supposed he knew a thing or two about sweet smells himself, having spent most of his life enveloped by the intoxicating scent of cedar and pine.

But today, something else hung in the air – a faint metallic tang, unfamiliar and unsettling.  Elias paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with a gnarled hand. He sniffed the air again. It wasn't just him; even the wind seemed to carry the strange odor.
