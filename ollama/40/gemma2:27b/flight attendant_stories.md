The recycled air hummed a monotonous tune as Elara Vance adjusted her crimson scarf, its silk catching the flickering fluorescent light above. Outside the tiny window, a tapestry of clouds stretched endlessly across the indigo canvas of dusk.  Elara sighed, a small plume of condensation briefly clouding the glass. Another transatlantic flight, another sea of unfamiliar faces staring back at her from their cramped seats. She wasn't sure what was more tiring: the endless cycle of takeoffs and landings or the forced smiles plastered on her face for hours on end. 

But tonight felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Elara's spine, a feeling she couldn't quite place. It wasn't fear, not exactly. More like... anticipation.  A subtle shift in the air, perhaps? Or maybe it was just the lingering scent of jasmine tea from the passenger seated across the aisle, its aroma swirling and clinging to the stale air. Whatever it was, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that this flight wouldn't be ordinary.
