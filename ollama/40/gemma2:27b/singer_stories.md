The flickering neon sign outside "The Blue Moon Saloon" cast an ethereal glow on Eliza Marie Beaumont's face as she adjusted the microphone stand. It was a Tuesday night, which meant the usual smattering of regulars: Gus, the retired fisherman with a penchant for whiskey sours and sea shanties; Mrs. Henderson, who always requested Ella Fitzgerald; and young Danny, who dreamed of joining a rock band someday and hung on Eliza's every note.

Eliza took a deep breath, the scent of stale beer and fried peanuts mingling in the air. The worn stage beneath her feet felt familiar, like an old friend welcoming her home. This wasn't a glamorous venue; it was rough around the edges, a bit dusty, but it held a charm Eliza found nowhere else. Tonight, she was going to sing her heart out, pouring every ounce of emotion into the music, hoping it would reach someone in the dimly lit crowd and remind them they weren't alone.
