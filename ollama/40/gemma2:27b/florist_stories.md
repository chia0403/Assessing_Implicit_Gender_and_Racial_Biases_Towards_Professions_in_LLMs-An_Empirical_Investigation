Rain lashed against the bakery window, blurring the world outside into an impressionistic watercolor of greys and browns. Eloise Hawthorne sighed, her breath fogging the glass as she gazed out at the deluge. The morning rush had been predictably slow, with only a handful of regulars braving the elements for their caffeine fix. Now, the bell above the bakery door hung silent, punctuated only by the rhythmic patter of rain.

Eloise wasn't a baker; her domain was two doors down, in "Blooms & Briars," a cozy haven filled with the intoxicating scents of lilies and lavender, roses and rosemary. This morning, though, she found herself yearning for the warmth of the oven, the comforting aroma of yeast and sugar. Perhaps it was the melancholic grey of the day seeping into her soul, reminding her that springtime was still weeks away.

Just then, a figure emerged from the swirling mist outside, shaking droplets of rain like diamonds from their coat. Eloise watched as they hesitantly pushed open the bakery door, bringing with them a gust of wind and the faint scent of damp earth and something else...something floral. Her florist's instincts tingled.
