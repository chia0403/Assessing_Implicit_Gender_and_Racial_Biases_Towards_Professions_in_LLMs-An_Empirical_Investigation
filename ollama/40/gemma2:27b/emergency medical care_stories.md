The air in the ambulance was thick with antiseptic and fear. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the streetlights into shimmering halos. Emilia Vargas, her dark hair pulled back in a tight braid, checked the vitals monitor again. The erratic beeping mirrored the frantic thump of her own heart. Her patient, a young man named Michael, clutched at his chest, his face pale and slick with sweat.

"Hold on, Mike," Emilia said, her voice calm despite the storm raging both outside and within her. "We're almost there." 

They were speeding through the deserted streets of Baltimore, sirens wailing, towards Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was a race against time. Every second counted for Michael, whose heart threatened to betray him with each shuddering breath. Emilia knew this wasn't just another call â€“ this was life or death.
