Rain lashed against the nursery window, mimicking the relentless drumming in Amelia Cartwright's chest.  It wasn't the storm that bothered her; she was used to the capricious nature of the English weather. It was the emptiness echoing through the brightly coloured room.

Amelia usually thrived amidst the joyous chaos of toddlers. Sticky fingerprints on her clothes were badges of honour, ear-splitting shrieks were music to her ears, and tantrums were just another opportunity for a cuddle and a calming song. But today, the nursery felt eerily quiet. All ten children were absent, victims of a nasty stomach bug that had swept through their families like wildfire.

She glanced at the clock. 10:32 am. Time crawled by with agonizing slowness. Amelia wished she could join the other staff who had been lucky enough to snag sick days, but someone had to hold down the fort. She'd already tidied, sorted toys, and planned elaborate activities for tomorrow, all while battling a growing sense of unease. 


What if something happened? What if...
