The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil and burnt rubber. Grease stained the concrete floor of Silas Jasper Blackwood III's garage, forming a map of his life's work. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. Silas, his calloused hands black with grime, leaned over the engine of a cherry-red '67 Mustang, the growl of its idling motor a familiar symphony to his ears. 

He wiped his brow with the back of his grease-stained hand, a tired sigh escaping his lips. It wasn't just the heat that was getting to him today; it was the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease gnawed at him, as persistent as the insistent chirping of crickets outside.  He glanced up at the clock on the wall: 3:17 pm. Just another Tuesday afternoon in Harmony Creek, a sleepy town where time seemed to move at half its normal speed. Or so it usually did. Today felt different.
