The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, stinging Amelia Winthrop's nostrils as she pushed open the door to her clientâ€™s apartment. Sunlight streamed through dusty windows onto faded floral wallpaper, illuminating a cluttered kitchen where a pot bubbled ominously on the stove. Mrs. Odette Dubois, a wisp of a woman with silver hair and worried eyes, stood frozen by the counter, clutching a cookbook in one hand and a wooden spoon in the other.

Amelia, her clipboard tucked under one arm and her signature smile already softening into concern, approached cautiously. "Mrs. Dubois," she began, her voice gentle, "everything alright?"


The setting is Mrs. Dubois' cluttered apartment kitchen in an older building, likely with dated decor and a sense of neglect. This contrast highlights Amelia's professionalism and the challenges she faces as a dietician trying to help someone struggling with their health and lifestyle.
