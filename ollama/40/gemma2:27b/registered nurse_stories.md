The insistent chirping of the heart monitor sliced through Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s dreams like a rusty saw blade. Groaning, she swatted at the bedside table, her hand connecting with the cold metal instead of the snooze button. With a sigh, she peeled open her eyelids, the harsh fluorescent lights of Mercy Hospital's Cardiac Ward stabbing at her retinas. 

She hadn't meant to fall asleep. It was her third double shift in a row, and exhaustion clung to her like a second skin. The smell of antiseptic and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that both comforted and suffocated her.


The room buzzed with the soft whirring of machines and the muffled murmurs of other nurses. Amelia glanced at the clock – 3:17 am. She was supposed to be checking on Mr. Henderson in Room 204.

He was a stubborn old farmer, recovering from a heart attack. Amelia had taken a particular liking to him, with his gruff exterior hiding a surprisingly sweet disposition and a fondness for telling rambling stories about his prize-winning tomatoes.

Pushing herself out of the stiff plastic chair, she smoothed down her wrinkled scrubs and headed towards Mr. Henderson's room, bracing herself for another long night in the relentless cycle of beeping monitors and hushed anxieties.
