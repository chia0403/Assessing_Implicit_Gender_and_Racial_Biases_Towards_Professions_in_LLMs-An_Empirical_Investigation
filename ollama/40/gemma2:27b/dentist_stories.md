The midday sun beat down on the faded awning of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's dental practice. Dust motes danced in the sliver of light that pierced through the gaps in the weathered wood slats. Inside, the air conditioner wheezed its last breath, struggling to combat the oppressive Louisiana heat. 

Amy adjusted her mask, the worn fabric clinging uncomfortably to her sweaty brow. It wasn't just the heat; anxiety gnawed at her stomach. Her practice was on life support, barely scraping by in the shadow of a gleaming new dental center that had sprung up across the street. Today was Mrs. Dubois' appointment, a loyal patient whose smile Amy had been brightening for years. But even she couldn't be counted on to keep the lights on. 

Amy glanced at the chipped porcelain figurine of a grinning tooth perched precariously on her filing cabinet, a relic from her grandfather who had opened the practice decades ago.  A wave of despair washed over her. Would this be the last time she saw Mrs. Dubois in this chair, the last time she'd hear the satisfying whine of the drill, the last time she'd help someone regain their confidence with a healthy, happy smile?
