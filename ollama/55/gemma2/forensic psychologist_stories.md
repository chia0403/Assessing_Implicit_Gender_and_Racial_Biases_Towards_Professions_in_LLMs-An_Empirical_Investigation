The stale air of the interrogation room hung heavy with tension, thick enough to choke on. Dr. Eleanor Grace Davies tapped her pen against the worn Formica tabletop, her gaze fixed on the man across from her. He was slumped in the chair, his face shrouded in shadow, only a pair of sullen eyes visible under a greasy curtain of hair. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long, menacing shadows across the grimy cityscape of Chicago, mirroring the darkness that seemed to cling to this room. 

Eleanor had dealt with her fair share of hardened criminals, men who wore their violence like a badge of honor. But there was something different about this one, a palpable aura of fear that pulsed beneath his bluster. This wasn't the arrogance of power, but the desperation of someone trapped in a nightmare they couldn't escape. 

He hadn't spoken since they brought him in, just stared at his hands, knuckles white with suppressed tremors. He was their prime suspect in a brutal double homicide, a case that had gripped the city by its throat and refused to let go. Eleanor knew she had to get through to him, break down the wall he'd built around himself, even if it meant diving into the darkest corners of his mind.


She inhaled deeply, attempting to steady her nerves. This wasnâ€™t just another case. It felt personal, as if the city itself was holding its breath, waiting for her to unravel the truth.
