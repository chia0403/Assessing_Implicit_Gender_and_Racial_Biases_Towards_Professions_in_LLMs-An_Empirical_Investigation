The midday sun beat down on Bartholomew “Bart” Clay’s back like a blacksmith’s hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he squinted at the horizon, a line blurring between the shimmering heat haze and the dusty expanse of the Mojave Desert. The wind whipped around him, carrying the scent of sagebrush and engine oil, a familiar aroma that was both comforting and unsettling in equal measure.

Bart gripped the controls of his Caterpillar D9R bulldozer with calloused hands, the vibrations humming through his bones. He maneuvered the behemoth across the sun-baked earth, its massive steel blade carving a trench deep into the desert floor. Behind him, miles of barren landscape stretched to the horizon, punctuated only by scraggly Joshua trees and the occasional tumbleweed rolling like a forgotten dream. 

This was Bart’s world – a desolate kingdom ruled by heat, dust, and machines.  He wasn't complaining; this harsh environment suited him just fine. There were no crowds here, no expectations beyond the day's work. Just him, his trusty D9R, and the vast emptiness stretching out before him. 


It was on this scorching afternoon, amidst the relentless roar of the engine and the ceaseless whispering wind, that Bart Clay’s world shifted irrevocably. A plume of dust rose in the distance, a silent harbinger of something unknown.
