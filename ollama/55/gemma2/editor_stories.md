The air in Eleanor Beatrice Thorne's office always smelled faintly of old paper and stale coffee. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes that danced like miniature galaxies above the overflowing bookshelves lining her walls. Outside, the bustling New York City streets pulsed with life – taxis honking, sirens wailing, a cacophony of urban energy. But inside Eleanor’s sanctuary, time seemed to move at its own languid pace. 

She perched on the edge of her worn leather chair, her fingers tracing the spine of a well-loved copy of “Wuthering Heights,”  a faint frown creasing her brow as she reread the manuscript in front of her. It was the third submission that day – each one promising a fresh voice, a groundbreaking narrative, but ultimately falling short. The words felt flat, the characters lacking depth. 

Eleanor sighed, the sound lost amidst the rustle of turning pages. She longed for something more, something to ignite her passion, to remind her why she'd chosen this path – a career spent sifting through mountains of prose, searching for the hidden gems waiting to be unearthed.  Perhaps today wouldn’t be that day.
