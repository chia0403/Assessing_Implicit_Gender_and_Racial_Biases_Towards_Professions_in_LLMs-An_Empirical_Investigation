The smell of stale coffee and regret hung heavy in the air of Amelia Beatrice Finch's cubicle. Numbers swam before her eyes, each one a tiny accusation whispering about missed deadlines and looming financial crises. She squinted at the spreadsheet, trying to decipher the tangled web of receipts and invoices for Finnegan & Son’s Plumbing Supply, a family business that seemed to be hemorrhaging cash faster than a burst pipe in winter. Amelia wasn't sure if she was more worried about saving the company or her sanity. 

Amelia sat alone in the dimly lit office, the fluorescent lights buzzing like a swarm of disgruntled bees above her head. Outside, the sun dripped through the grimy windowpane, casting long shadows across the cluttered desk piled high with unpaid bills and forgotten coffee mugs.  A lone, potted cactus stood defiantly in the corner, its prickly needles mirroring Amelia’s own mood. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of her keyboard as she desperately tried to wrangle the unruly finances into some semblance of order. 


This wasn't how Amelia had envisioned her life. She'd dreamt of grand adventures, exotic locales, and thrilling mysteries – not endless rows of numbers and invoices for leaky faucets and toilet plungers. But here she was, trapped in this beige purgatory, a prisoner of her own meticulous nature and a family friend’s plea for help.  

It was time to find out what secrets those numbers were hiding – and maybe, just maybe, save the day (and herself) in the process.
