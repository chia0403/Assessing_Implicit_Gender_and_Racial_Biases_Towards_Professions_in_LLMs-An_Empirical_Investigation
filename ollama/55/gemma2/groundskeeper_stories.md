The air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and honeysuckle, a fragrance that usually brought Elias Blackwood peace.  But today, it seemed to amplify the hum of unease buzzing beneath his skin. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Hawthorne Manor, stretching like grasping fingers towards him as he knelt by the ancient oak tree. Its leaves, normally vibrant emerald green, were tinged with a sickly yellow at the edges, and its branches sagged with an unnatural heaviness. 

Elias ran a calloused hand over the rough bark, feeling for any unusual warmth or tremors. Nothing. He'd been tending to Hawthorne Manor’s sprawling grounds for twenty years, ever since his grandfather had passed away, leaving him the family legacy. During those two decades, he'd seen seasons change, witnessed weddings and funerals, even felt the tremor of an earthquake once. But this… this felt different. A creeping chill settled over him, whispering secrets in the rustling leaves. 


He straightened up, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow. The manor itself loomed above him, a gothic behemoth silhouetted against the dying light. Its windows were dark, like empty eyes staring back at him. 

Elias Blackwood, groundskeeper and keeper of Hawthorne Manor's secrets, wasn't sure what he was facing today. But he knew it was something he couldn't ignore.
