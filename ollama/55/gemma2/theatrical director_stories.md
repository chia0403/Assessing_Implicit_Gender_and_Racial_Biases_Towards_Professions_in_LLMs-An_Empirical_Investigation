The scent of stale beer and regret hung heavy in the air of The Red Curtain, its once vibrant red velvet now faded to a dusty rose. Eleanor Beatrice Beaumont, better known as Bea, surveyed the scene with the weary resignation of someone who had seen too many opening nights go south.  She ran a hand through her wind-tangled auburn hair, pulling at a loose strand that seemed determined to mimic the frayed edges of the theater's faded grandeur. 

The stage was bare except for a single spotlight illuminating an empty chair, like a theatrical throne waiting for its forgotten king. Behind it, the wings were cluttered with half-assembled props and discarded costumes, testament to the frantic, last-minute scramble that had characterized rehearsals for "A Midsummer Night's Dream."  But Bea wasn't concerned about the mess. This opening night was already lost before the curtain even rose. 


The setting: A crumbling, historic theater on the outskirts of a forgotten coastal town. Its once bustling energy has long since faded, replaced by a sense of melancholy and regret. The year is 1987, and the air hums with the bittersweet nostalgia of an era on the verge of change.
