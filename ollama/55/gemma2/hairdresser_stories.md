The bell above the door to "Snip & Style" tinkled merrily as Amelia Rose Worthington tucked another stray curl behind her ear. Outside, the Parisian air was thick with the scent of fresh croissants and impending rain.  Amelia glanced at the clock – 9:05 am, just five minutes past opening time. She straightened a scattering of hairspray on the counter, then picked up her phone. No calls yet. Just another Tuesday morning in the charming but quiet corner of Montmartre where she'd built her little salon over the past ten years.  


Amelia sighed, taking in the cozy scene: worn leather armchairs arranged around an antique vanity mirror, shelves lined with bottles of vibrant hair dye and fragrant styling products, and a window overlooking a cobblestone street teeming with artists setting up their easels. Her usual clientele – a mix of local artists, writers, and the occasional tourist looking for a touch of Parisian chic – were typically slow to arrive on Tuesdays. 


But today felt different. A nervous energy buzzed in Amelia's chest, making her tap her foot impatiently against the floor. It wasn’t just the anticipation of the first customer; it was something more, a feeling that this day could be anything but ordinary.
