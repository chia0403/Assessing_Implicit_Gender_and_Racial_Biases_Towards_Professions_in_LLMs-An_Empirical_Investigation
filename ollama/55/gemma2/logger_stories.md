The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Elias Thornewood. He inhaled deeply, savoring the earthy aroma as he surveyed his domain: a sprawling swathe of ancient redwoods, their towering trunks like sentinels guarding secrets whispered through centuries. Sunlight dappled the forest floor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness before the day’s work began. 

Elias, a man forged by the harsh realities of the Pacific Northwest, ran a calloused hand over the rough bark of a giant redwood, feeling its age and resilience beneath his fingertips. His worn leather jacket hung loosely on his lean frame, the sleeves rolled up to reveal forearms etched with lines that spoke of years spent wrestling with nature’s raw power. A faint scar traced its way across his cheekbone, a memento from a past encounter with a fallen giant.  

The sun climbed higher in the sky, painting the forest canopy in hues of gold and emerald. The symphony of birdsong began to crescendo, a prelude to the familiar roar that signaled the start of another day in the life of a logger. Elias Thornewood, master of the saw and the woods, was ready.
