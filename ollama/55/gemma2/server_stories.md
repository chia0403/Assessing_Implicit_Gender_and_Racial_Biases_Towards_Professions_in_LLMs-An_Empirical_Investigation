The rhythmic clang of silverware against ceramic plates was the soundtrack to Elara Josephine Moon's life. It wasn't an unpleasant sound, not exactly. It held a certain kind of comforting predictability, like the sunrise over the greasy diner windows. 

Elara worked at "The Starlight Diner," a beacon of greasy goodness in the neon-lit heart of Duskhaven City. The diner was a haven for truckers on long hauls, weary construction workers, and locals who craved the familiar comfort of overcooked fries and lukewarm coffee. 

It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills. And besides, Elara had a knack for remembering regulars' orders, her smile as bright as the neon sign outside that read "Eat Here, Live Longer." Tonight, though, something felt different. The air crackled with an unsettling energy, and even the usual hum of conversation seemed to vibrate with a hidden tension.  


Elara smoothed down her checkered uniform apron and braced herself for the shift. She had a feeling this was going to be one night she wouldn't soon forget.
