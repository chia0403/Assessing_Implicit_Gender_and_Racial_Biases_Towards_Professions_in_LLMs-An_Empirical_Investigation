The sun beat down on Seamus "Mac" McAlister's neck like an anvil. Sweat stung his eyes as he maneuvered another coil of shingles across the rickety wooden platform, each step protesting with groans and creaks beneath him. The old Victorian house loomed above him, a sprawling beast of faded grandeur, its intricate roofline a labyrinth of valleys and peaks. Mac wiped his brow with a grimy sleeve, squinting at the horizon where wisps of clouds gathered like hesitant mourners against the cerulean sky.  

The air buzzed with the hum of cicadas and the distant rumble of thunder, a prelude to the inevitable afternoon storm that rolled in every day around this time. Mac knew he needed to finish the last section of the roof before the heavens opened, but a knot of anxiety tightened in his gut. This wasn't just any old job; it was Mrs. Delacroix's house, and her grandson, Timmy, had been diagnosed with leukemia.  Mac felt an immense responsibility, not just to complete the repair before the storm, but to give Timmy a roof over his head while he fought for his life. 


The setting is a quiet suburban town in the Northeastern United States, late summer.
