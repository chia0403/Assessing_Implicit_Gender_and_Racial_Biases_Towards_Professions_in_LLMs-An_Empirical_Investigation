The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of gleaming metal instruments laid out on the tray before her. She smoothed down the collar of her crisp white uniform, adjusting the stethoscope dangling around her neck.  

Amelia inhaled sharply, the familiar sterile scent of disinfectant and peppermint toothpaste filling her nostrils. It was a scent sheâ€™d come to associate with calm, with order, with the quiet satisfaction of a job well done. But today, the usual sense of peace felt strained, replaced by an unsettling prickle of anticipation. 


**Setting:**  

A bustling suburban dental practice in a small town outside of Boston, Massachusetts. It's late afternoon on a Tuesday, and the air is thick with the quiet hum of activity as the last few patients are seen. The waiting room, normally a sea of colorful magazines and anxious chatter, is deserted, save for a lone potted fern drooping listlessly in the corner.  The scent of freshly brewed coffee lingers from an unattended thermos on the reception desk.
