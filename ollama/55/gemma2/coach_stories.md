The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to cling to Amelia “Amy” Rose Hawthorne like a damp shirt. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the early hour, trickling down into the collar of her faded practice tee.  She wiped it away with the back of her hand, squinting at the blurry figures practicing drills in the nascent dawn light. Her high school football team, the Riverton Rams, were already pushing themselves, a symphony of grunts and thuds echoing across the dew-soaked field. Amy watched them with a critical eye, her mind whirring as she plotted their next moves – not just for the upcoming season, but for these boys' futures, both on and off the field. 


This wasn't just a job for Amy; it was her passion, her purpose.  She had poured everything she had into coaching them, molding them into more than just athletes. This team, with their raw talent and unbridled enthusiasm, felt like family to her. And she wouldn't let anything – not the pressure from parents, the skepticism of the school board, or even the crushing weight of expectation – stand in the way of them reaching their full potential.
