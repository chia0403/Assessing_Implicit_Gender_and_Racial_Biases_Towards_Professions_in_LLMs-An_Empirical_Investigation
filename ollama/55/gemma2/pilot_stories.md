The crimson sun bled across the horizon, casting long shadows over the rusted landing strip. A biting desert wind whipped Amelia "Ace" Thorne's hair around her face as she prepped the engine of her salvaged Skyraider. The Mojave Desert stretched out before her, a vast expanse of ochre sand dunes and scrub brush, swallowing the last vestiges of twilight. This forgotten corner of Nevada was Ace's home, a desolate haven where she could disappear from the ghosts of her past. 

Her calloused fingers tightened around the grip of the ancient joystick. The Skyraider, patched together with scavenged parts and hope, hummed to life, its growl echoing across the silence. It wasn't much, but it was hers. A symbol of freedom in a world that had tried to cage her.

Tonight's mission: track down a whispered rumour, a whisper of ancient secrets hidden deep within the desert canyons. A whisper promising something more than just survival.
