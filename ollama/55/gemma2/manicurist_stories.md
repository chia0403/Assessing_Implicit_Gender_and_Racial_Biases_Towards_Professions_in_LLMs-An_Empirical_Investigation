The air in "Nails & Nonsense" was thick with the scent of acetone and lavender. Neon pink lights cast a cheery glow on rows of glistening bottles, each filled with a rainbow of enamel promising transformation. The clinking of metal against glass punctuated the rhythmic buzzing of the electric nail files.  This was Esmeralda “Esme” Luna’s sanctuary, her manicurist haven amidst the cacophony of the bustling city.

Esme expertly filed a client’s nails, her movements precise and practiced, a symphony of feminine power in miniature. Her eyes, however, were not focused on the task at hand. Instead, they drifted towards the shop’s front window, catching glimpses of the stormy sky swirling outside.  A sense of unease, as unpredictable as the weather, began to simmer within her. 


This wasn't just another Tuesday afternoon. A feeling, heavy and insistent, told Esme that something was about to change, something big, something... strange.
