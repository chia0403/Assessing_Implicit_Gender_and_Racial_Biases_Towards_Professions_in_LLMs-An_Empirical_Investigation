The siren's wail sliced through the humid Georgia night, a mournful cry against the backdrop of cicada song. Rain slicked the asphalt, turning the world into an impressionist painting of blurred lights and neon streaks. Inside Ambulance 17, Elena "Ellie" Ramirez gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white as bone. Beside her, paramedic Ben Carter checked their equipment, his face etched with fatigue – another double shift under their belt.  

They were responding to a possible cardiac arrest at the Peach Pit, a notorious dive bar on the outskirts of Savannah. Ellie had a bad feeling about this one. The call came through garbled, the dispatcher's voice strained with urgency, the victim described only as "a regular." Ellie knew that could mean anyone, from the kindly old bartender who poured them their free coffee to the biker gang regulars who argued over pool. 

The Peach Pit loomed ahead, a dilapidated brick building illuminated by flickering neon signs promising cheap beer and live music. As they pulled up, the rain intensified, drumming a frantic rhythm on the ambulance's roof. A young woman in a ripped t-shirt emerged from the shadows, her face streaked with tears and rain. 


"He's inside," she said, voice trembling. "He just... he just collapsed."  

Ellie exchanged a look with Ben. They both knew what that meant – they had seconds to spare. This was their job, their purpose – to be the last line of defense against the darkness. And tonight, someone needed them.
