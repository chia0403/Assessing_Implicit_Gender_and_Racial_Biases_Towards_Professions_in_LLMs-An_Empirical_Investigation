Rain lashed against Eleanor "Ellie" Beatrice Hawthorne's office window, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic watercolor of neon streaks and shimmering puddles.  The incessant drumming echoed the frantic rhythm in Ellie's chest. It was 5:45 PM, the witching hour for insurance agents - the time when desperation clawed at clients like the storm outside. Tonight, she was facing down a particularly ferocious beast: Mr. Bartholomew "Bart" Grimshaw, notorious for his theatrics and penchant for suing everyone from squirrels to the weather.  

Ellie sat hunched over her desk, reviewing Bart's claims file for the tenth time. The man wanted to sue the company for emotional distress after a rogue frisbee landed on his prized petunias during a park picnic. It was absurd, but Ellie knew better than to underestimate Bart. He had a way of twisting logic into knots and convincing juries that he was perpetually wronged.  

Ellie took a deep breath, smoothing down her crimson blouse â€“ her "fight fire with fire" uniform for dealing with the likes of Mr. Grimshaw. She wasn't going to let him win this time. The only thing more daunting than facing Bart was the thought of her boss, Ms. Henrietta Finch, finding out she hadn't settled yet.
