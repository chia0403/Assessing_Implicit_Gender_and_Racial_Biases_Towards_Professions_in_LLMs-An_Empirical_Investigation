The fluorescent hum of the pharmacy lights cast a sickly yellow pallor over Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Finch's workspace. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and lavender hand sanitizer, a scent that usually soothed her, but tonight felt oppressive. It was closing time, and the shelves lined with bottles promising relief from aches and anxieties seemed to mock her own turmoil.  

The bell above the door chimed, breaking the silence. Amy looked up, expecting a last-minute customer, but it was just Mrs. Henderson, the elderly woman who lived across the street, bringing back a forgotten bottle of cough syrup. 


"Oh, dear," Mrs. Henderson sighed, her voice raspy, "I've been feeling under the weather all day. This flu is going around like wildfire."

Amy forced a smile. "We can get you something stronger if you're not feeling any better tomorrow, Mrs. Henderson. Maybe some vitamin C and ginger tea too?"

Mrs. Henderson shook her head, her eyes cloudy with worry. "It's more than just the flu this time, Amy. It feels... different."  Her gaze lingered on Amy, a strange intensity in her usually gentle eyes. "I don't know what's happening to me, dear. I justâ€¦ feel like something terrible is coming."

Amy swallowed nervously, dismissing Mrs. Henderson's words as the ramblings of an aging mind. The pharmacy was quiet again, the hum of the lights a constant companion to her unease. She knew she should focus on closing up, but Mrs. Henderson's last words echoed in her head, a dark premonition clinging to them like the scent of lavender.
