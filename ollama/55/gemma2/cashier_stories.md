The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Beaumont's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of brightly coloured cereal boxes. It was 7:32 AM, the witching hour at the Sparkle Mart, that desolate stretch of suburban purgatory where sleep-deprived parents and bleary-eyed teenagers met for their daily dose of caffeine and sugary snacks. Amy sighed, her gaze drifting to the clock on the wall. Another four hours before the rush began.  

The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and day-old pastries. The only other sound besides the hum of the lights was the rhythmic click-clack of a cleaning cart being wheeled down aisle three by Mr. Henderson, a man who seemed perpetually stuck in an existential loop of dusting shelves and muttering about the decline of Western civilisation.  

Amy leaned against the counter, idly drumming her fingers on the chipped laminate. Her reflection stared back at her - dark circles under tired eyes, hair pulled back in a messy ponytail, a nametag pinned precariously to her faded blue apron. Just another Tuesday morning in paradise.
