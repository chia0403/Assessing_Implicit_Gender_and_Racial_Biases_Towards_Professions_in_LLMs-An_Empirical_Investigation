The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Finch's head like a swarm of agitated bees. Her cubicle, nestled in a sea of beige desks at Finch & Sons Tax Services, was a haven of organized chaos. Receipts overflowed from file folders, calculator screens glowed with numbers that spun faster than her overworked mind could process, and the smell of stale coffee hung heavy in the air. Outside the window, February in Duluth was a blizzard of white, but Amy's world revolved around the swirling vortex of tax season.

It started innocently enough, filling out forms for family and friends. Then came the word-of-mouth referrals, then the flyers at the local grocery store. Soon, Amy found herself drowning in W-2s, 1099s, and the ever-dreaded Schedule C forms. Her once beloved hobby had morphed into a full-fledged business, one she desperately needed to make work if she wanted to keep her head above water after her divorce last year.  

Today was particularly brutal. The phone line buzzed incessantly with frantic clients, demanding extensions, questioning deductions, and lamenting the complexities of the tax code. Amy sipped her lukewarm coffee, willing herself to stay focused on the return in front of her: a single, elderly woman struggling to make ends meet, who had entrusted Amy with her financial well-being for the year. 


Amy knew every dollar mattered, and she wouldn't let this client down.  She just wished she could afford a decent cup of coffee amidst the chaos.
