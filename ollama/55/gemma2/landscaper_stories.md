The August sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's neck as he wrestled another overgrown oak into submission. Sweat stung his eyes, but he couldn't afford to wipe it away; not with Mrs. Peabody's prized petunias demanding his attention just a few feet away. He grimaced, the scent of freshly cut grass and rotting leaves filling his nostrils. This wasn't exactly what he envisioned when he'd dreamt of "working outside." 

Bart was a landscaper, employed by Willow Creek Landscaping, a middling company that seemed to specialize in battling nature rather than cultivating it. His current assignment: the sprawling Victorian mansion of Mrs. Eleanor Peabody, a woman who, according to local rumour, held her petunias in higher regard than her own children. The manicured lawn surrounding the mansion was a battlefield of overgrown weeds, wayward roses, and rogue branches that clawed at the sky like desperate fingers. 


This wasn't just another job for Bart; it felt personal. He had a history with Mrs. Peabody, one that involved a disastrous attempt at a birthday card in his awkward adolescence and a lifetime of avoiding eye contact whenever their paths crossed. He hoped that by taming her unruly garden, he could somehow earn her grudging approval, or at least avoid further social catastrophe. But as the oak groaned under his effort, Bart couldn't help but feel like this battle was already lost.
