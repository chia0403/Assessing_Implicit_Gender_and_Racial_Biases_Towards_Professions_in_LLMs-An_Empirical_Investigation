The scent of lavender hand sanitizer clung to Dr. Amelia Beaumont's skin like a ghost of her morning commute. Her tiny office, nestled on the second floor of a creaky Victorian building in downtown Seattle, felt stuffy and airless despite the open window letting in the crisp autumn breeze.  

Amelia sat at her desk, reviewing notes on her next patient, a 28-year-old woman named Lena struggling with agoraphobia. The rain pattered against the glass panes, mirroring the anxiety that gnawed at Amelia's own chest. She hadn't been able to shake off the weight of yesterday's session â€“ a particularly harrowing story from Mr. Jones, a war veteran battling PTSD.

Lena was due in any minute. 

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to center herself. The rain might be drumming a relentless rhythm against the window, but inside her office, she had to create a sanctuary of calm. She needed to be the steady anchor for Lena's storm.
