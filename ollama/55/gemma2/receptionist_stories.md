The fluorescent lights hummed above Evelyn Beatrice Thornton's head like a swarm of agitated bees.  She adjusted her cardigan, the thin wool offering little comfort against the perpetual chill of the office. Outside, the city was waking up, its symphony of horns and sirens filtering through the dusty windows of Thorne & Co., a small, midtown law firm that seemed to operate on a different time zone altogether. Evelyn, perched behind her desk like a sentinel in a warzone of unfiled paperwork, watched the day unfold with the detachment of someone who had seen it all before – which, given her fifteen years at the firm, she pretty much had.  

The morning’s quiet hum was shattered by the shrill ring of the phone, jarring Evelyn from her observation post. With a practiced flick of her wrist, she snagged the receiver, her voice already adopting its professional, if slightly weary, timbre. "Thorne & Co., Evelyn speaking."
