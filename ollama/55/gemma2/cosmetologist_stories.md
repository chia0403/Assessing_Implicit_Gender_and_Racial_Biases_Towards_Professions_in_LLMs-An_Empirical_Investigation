The air in "Blushing Belles" was thick with the sweet scent of vanilla and bergamot, a symphony orchestrated by Amelia Lavender-Rose, Master Cosmetologist and owner of the quaint little salon tucked away on Maple Street. Sunlight streamed through the frosted glass windows, casting dancing patterns on the worn wooden floors.  Amelia hummed along to Patsy Cline's melancholic melody emanating from the vintage record player, her nimble fingers expertly weaving a braid into the auburn mane of Mrs. Henderson, a regular who swore by Amelia’s touch for taming her unruly curls. 

The bell above the door chimed, breaking the serene rhythm of the afternoon.  Amelia paused, her brow furrowing slightly as she caught the scent of something unfamiliar – a sharp, metallic tang that didn't belong in the sanctuary of her salon. This wasn’t vanilla and bergamot.  This was something… else entirely.
