The sun, a malevolent eye burning through the haze of dust devils, beat down on Bartholomew "Bear" Callahan's weathered face. Sweat stung his eyes as he squinted at the horizon, where the endless expanse of Texas plains stretched out before him, baked and cracked by weeks without rain. The silence was oppressive, broken only by the occasional rasping caw of a crow circling overhead.
