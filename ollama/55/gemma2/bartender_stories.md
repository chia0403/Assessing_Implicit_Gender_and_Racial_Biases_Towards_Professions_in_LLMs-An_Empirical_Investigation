The stale scent of beer and regret hung thick in the air of The Rusty Tap, mingling with the faint aroma of bleach from Fiona "Fin" MacAllister's latest attempt at scrubbing away the sins of the weekend. A lone jukebox crooned a mournful ballad about lost love, its melody swallowed by the clatter of glasses being rinsed and the muffled hum of conversation from the handful of stragglers still clinging to their Friday night buzz.

Fin wiped down the sticky counter with practiced ease, her emerald eyes scanning the room. The Tap was usually buzzing at this hour, a chaotic symphony of laughter, drunken arguments, and clinking glasses. But tonight, it felt like a graveyard of abandoned dreams, each empty stool a silent testament to the weight of Monday morning looming just around the corner.  

Outside, the first tendrils of dawn were starting to creep across the sky, painting the horizon in hues of pale orange and bruised purple. The city was still asleep, but within The Rusty Tap, Fin MacAllister knew that tomorrow's troubles were already brewing.
