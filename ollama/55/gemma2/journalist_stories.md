The flickering neon sign outside the "Rusty Bucket" cast an anemic glow on Elias Thorne's rain-slicked trench coat. Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof, creating a frantic rhythm that mirrored the churning in his gut. Elias inhaled deeply, trying to mask the metallic tang of fear with the stale scent of cheap beer and regret. This dive bar, nestled deep in the industrial heart of New Orleans, was hardly where he'd envisioned spending a Friday night, but desperation had a way of rewriting itineraries. 

He pushed open the creaky door, a blast of hot, humid air washing over him like a wave.  Inside, shadows danced to the mournful wail of blues music emanating from a corner stage. The regulars, faces obscured by cigarette smoke and weary indifference, barely glanced at him as he slid onto a stool at the bar. This was his last hope: finding Isabelle Dubois, a local artist who vanished without a trace three weeks ago, leaving behind only cryptic emails hinting at something sinister lurking beneath the city's vibrant facade. 


Elias Thorne wasn’t your typical investigative journalist –  he preferred dusty archives and old paper trails to the cutthroat world of online sensationalism. But Isabelle’s case had burrowed under his skin, whispering a truth he couldn’t ignore. He just needed to find her before whatever darkness she'd stumbled upon swallowed her whole.
