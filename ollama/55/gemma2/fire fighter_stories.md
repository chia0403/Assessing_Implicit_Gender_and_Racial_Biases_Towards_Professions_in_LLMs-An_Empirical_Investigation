The acrid scent of smoke stung Amelia "Amy" Hayes' nostrils even before she turned onto Elm Street. A jagged orange glow bled through the gaps in the boarded-up windows of the old Victorian house at the end of the block, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the manicured lawns.  

Amy gripped the steering wheel tighter, her heart hammering against her ribs. She wasn't new to fires; she'd been a firefighter with Station 12 for six years now, but there was always something unsettling about an inferno tearing through a home. It felt personal, invasive. Like watching a living being succumb to flames.  

The siren wailed, cutting through the eerie stillness of the late summer night. As they pulled up, Amy could see the flames leaping hungrily towards the roof, their orange tongues licking at the dry shingles. The air crackled with heat and the distant shouts of her crew echoed in her ears. She took a deep breath, steeling herself against the wave of fear that threatened to engulf her. This wasn't the time for hesitation. It was time to fight. 


The setting is a small suburban town on a summer night. The fire takes place in an old Victorian house on Elm Street, known for its beautiful architecture and long history within the community.
