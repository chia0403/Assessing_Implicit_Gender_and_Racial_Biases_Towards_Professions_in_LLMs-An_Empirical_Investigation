The air in Amelia Harper's cubicle hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Papers, each one a fragile vessel containing someone's hopes and fears, spilled over her desk like overflowing tributaries. A fluorescent light hummed above, casting a sickly yellow pallor on the scene, amplifying the fatigue etching itself onto Amelia's face. The clock ticked mercilessly towards 6pm, the supposed end of another day in the legal trenches at Henderson & Thorne. But for Amelia, it felt more like the beginning of another battle.

Her phone buzzed, shattering the tense silence. It was Mr. Thorne himself, his voice a gravelly baritone booming through the receiver. "Harper, I need that motion filed by morning. No excuses." 

Amelia swallowed, her throat dry.  "Yes, sir," she whispered, already feeling the familiar surge of anxiety coil in her stomach.


This wasn't just another case. This was Mrs. Peterson, a single mother fighting for custody of her child against an affluent ex-husband with a team of lawyers at his disposal. And Amelia, a paralegal armed with nothing but tenacity and a mountain of paperwork, was her only hope.
