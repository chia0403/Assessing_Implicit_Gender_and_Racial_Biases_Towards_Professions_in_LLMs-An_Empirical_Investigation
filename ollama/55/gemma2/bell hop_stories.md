He moved with practiced grace, a maestro conducting the intricate symphony of arrival and departure that defined the Excelsior. But tonight, something was different. A chill prickled Arthur's skin, a sense of anticipation that had nothing to do with another shipment of orchids from Paris or a particularly fussy duchess demanding extra pillows.
