The acrid tang of burnt oil and gasoline hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Reyes as she bent over the sputtering engine.  Her hands, stained with grease and calluses honed by years of wrenching, worked deftly amidst a tangle of metal and wire.  Sweat beaded on her forehead, tracing paths through the grime already caked there. 

The garage, "Reyes' Repair", was a cramped space squeezed between a laundromat and a dusty pawn shop in the heart of Albuquerque. Sunlight slanted through grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air.  A faded sign hanging crookedly from the ceiling boasted "Honest work, fair prices." A claim Amy took pride in upholding, even if her customers often arrived with stories that tested the limits of both honesty and fairness.

This particular engine belonged to a beat-up '72 Ford Maverick, its cherry red paint long since faded to a dusty rose, the body panels marred by dents and rust. Its owner, a wiry man named Hank with weary eyes and a missing front tooth, leaned against the workbench, watching Amy work with a mixture of hope and trepidation. He'd been down on his luck lately, relying on this old Maverick to haul his meager belongings from one day job to the next.  

"Think you can fix it, Amy?" Hank asked, his voice rough as gravel.

Amy straightened up, wiping her hands on a greasy rag. "I reckon so," she said, meeting Hank's gaze with a reassuring smile. "Just gotta find out what's got this old girl sputtering."
