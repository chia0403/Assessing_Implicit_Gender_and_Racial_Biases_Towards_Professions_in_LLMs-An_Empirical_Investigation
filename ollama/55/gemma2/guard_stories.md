The rusted iron gate groaned like an arthritic beast as Silas Blackwood heaved it open. The air hung heavy with the cloying scent of jasmine and the musky aroma of unwashed bodies. This was Duskhaven, the most lawless city in the Azure Coast, where shadows danced longer than hope and whispers carried on the wind spoke of forgotten gods and darker secrets. 

Silas, his worn leather tunic flapping against his lean frame, surveyed the scene with practiced eyes. Street urchins darted through the throngs of weary merchants, their nimble fingers searching for an unguarded purse or a dropped coin. A group of burly men with faces etched in violence guffawed over tankards overflowing with questionable ale, while a lone woman shrouded in silk wept silently by a crumbling fountain. The city pulsed with a chaotic rhythm, a symphony of desperation and fleeting moments of joy. 

Silas, City Guard Sergeant Blackwood, was the only note of order in this cacophony. He adjusted the heavy sword strapped to his hip, its worn leather hilt comforting against his calloused palm. His duty: to maintain a semblance of peace within these crumbling walls, a task that felt increasingly futile with every passing day. 


Duskhaven awaited him, and so did another night on the razor's edge.
