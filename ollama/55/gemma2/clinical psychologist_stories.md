The flickering neon sign outside "Inner Sanctum," Dr. Amelia Grace Harper's practice, cast a sickly green hue across her face as she reviewed patient files. A chill wind whipped through the gaps in the weathered wooden frame of the building, sending a shiver down her spine despite the worn wool cardigan hugging her against the November cold. 

Amelia sat nestled behind her cluttered desk, a battlefield of well-thumbed self-help books, half-empty mugs, and scattered scribbles on yellow notepads. Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mimicking the incessant drumming in her chest. Tonight was different. Tonight, she wasn't just facing another stack of anxieties and traumas; tonight, she was staring down a darkness that threatened to swallow her whole.  


The setting: A small coastal town in Maine, shrouded in perpetual twilight during November. The building: An aging Victorian house, once grand but now weathered and faded, with peeling paint and flickering gas lamps struggling against the encroaching gloom.
