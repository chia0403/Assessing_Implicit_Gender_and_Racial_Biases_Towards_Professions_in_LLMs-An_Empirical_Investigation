The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Elias Thorne as he knelt beside the sputtering light fixture. Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the dilapidated barn, each drop echoing like a tiny hammer blow against his skull. 

Elias, his calloused fingers nimble despite the downpour, traced the tangled wires with practiced ease.  The old farmhouse had seen better days, and its electrical system was barely holding on, like a frayed rope struggling to bear the weight of a storm. Elias wasn't just an electrician; he was a magician, coaxing life back into these forgotten circuits, mending the threads that kept darkness at bay. 

He lived for moments like these -  the quiet hum of electricity returning, the sudden burst of light chasing away shadows. It was a symphony of sparks and clicks, a language only he truly understood. But this time, there was something different about the resistance in the wires, a subtle hum that sent a shiver down his spine. This wasn't just another faulty connection. 


**Setting:** A remote, rain-soaked farmhouse on the edge of a vast, windswept plain in rural Montana.

**Main Character:** Elias Thorne, an electrician with weathered hands and a keen understanding of electricity. He possesses a quiet intensity, driven by a deep sense of purpose in his work.
