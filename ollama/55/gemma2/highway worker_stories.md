The desert sun beat down on Elias Theodore Johnson's neck, turning his already tanned skin to leather. Sweat stung his eyes as he squinted at the shimmering heat waves rising from the asphalt. The Nevada highway stretched before him like a cracked ribbon, baking under the relentless glare.  

Elias was a patchman, responsible for keeping this lonely stretch of road safe and passable. He wasn't a glamorous job, far from it, but it offered solitude â€“ something Elias craved after years spent tangled in the frenetic energy of Las Vegas. Out here, surrounded by nothing but sagebrush and sky, he found a strange kind of peace.

Today, though, even the silence seemed strained. A low rumble vibrated through the ground, growing louder with each passing minute.  Elias glanced up at the distant road, watching a plume of black smoke rise like a phantom against the blue. His stomach clenched. Whatever it was, it was heading straight for him.
