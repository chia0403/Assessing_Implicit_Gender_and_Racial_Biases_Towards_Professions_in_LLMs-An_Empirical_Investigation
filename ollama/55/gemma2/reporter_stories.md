The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and simmering asphalt. The late afternoon sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne's neck as she scribbled furiously in her notepad, barely noticing the sweat trickling down her spine.  

Amy, a sharp-eyed reporter for the small-town weekly, "The Gopher Gazette," was perched precariously on a wobbly stool outside the Grand Magnolia Diner. The diner, with its faded pastel paint and worn checkered floors, was the heart of Harmony Springs, Georgia, a town where gossip flowed as freely as sweet tea. And right now, Amy needed that gossip.  

Harmony Springs had been shaken to its core by the sudden disappearance of Mayor Reginald "Reg" Thompson. He'd vanished without a trace two days ago, leaving behind only a half-eaten plate of pecan pie and a town buzzing with speculation. The Sheriff was baffled, the townsfolk were whispering, and Amy knew this story could be bigger than sheâ€™d ever imagined.
