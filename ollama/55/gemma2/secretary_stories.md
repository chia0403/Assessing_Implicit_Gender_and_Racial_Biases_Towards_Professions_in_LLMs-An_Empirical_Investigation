The rhythmic click-clack of Elsie Beatrice Pemberton's fingers against the antique typewriter filled the silence of Mr. Hemmingsworth's office like a metronome counting down to another dreary afternoon. Sunlight, filtered through the dust-laden windows, cast long shadows across the worn Persian rug and illuminated motes dancing in the stale air.  

Elsie sat perched on the edge of her high-backed chair, her sensible shoes tapping impatiently against the linoleum floor. She had been waiting for Mr. Hemmingsworth to emerge from his meeting with potential investors for what felt like an eternity.  The tension in the room was thick enough to spread on toast.  

Outside, London hummed with the vibrancy of a city at midday â€“ laughter echoing from cafes, the clatter of trams rumbling down the street, children's voices calling out in playful abandon. But within these four walls, time seemed to have stalled, held captive by Mr. Hemmingsworth's indecision and Elsie's growing frustration.
