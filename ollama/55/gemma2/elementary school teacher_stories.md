## The Yellow Crayon Mystery

**Setting:** Sunnyside Elementary, a bustling brick building nestled in a quiet suburban neighborhood. Fall leaves painted vibrant hues on the manicured lawn, and the scent of pumpkin spice lingered in the crisp air. 

**Main Character:** Ms. Amelia Rose Hawthorne, a fourth-grade teacher with a heart as warm as her sunflower-yellow cardigan. She prided herself on creating a classroom where imagination thrived, but lately, something felt off.  


Amelia adjusted her spectacles, peering down at the half-drawn picture in front of her. A lopsided sun glared out from behind a blurry mountain range, its rays represented by uneven strokes of...a yellow crayon that was suspiciously short. Not just any yellow crayon – it was the exact same shade as Ms. Hawthorne’s favorite cardigan.  Her heart skipped a beat. This wasn't the first time this week she'd found missing crayons, and every one had been a unique color, used in peculiar ways. 


A shiver ran down her spine. Was it just an overactive imagination fueled by too much Halloween candy, or was there something more to these disappearing crayons?  Amelia knew, deep down, that the mystery of the yellow crayon was just the beginning.
