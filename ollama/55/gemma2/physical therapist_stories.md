The stale smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Grace Blackwood's scrubs like a second skin. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on Phoenix General Hospital, turning the world outside into a shimmering mirage. Inside, however, the room remained cool and sterile, lit by the fluorescent hum of overhead lights that cast a sickly yellow glow over the treatment table. 

Amelia stretched her neck, trying to loosen the tension that always seemed to build up in those long days. She glanced at her schedule: Mr. Hernandez, fractured hip; Mrs. Miller, recovering from knee surgery; and then young Tommy, whose cerebral palsy limited his mobility. Each patient a story, each challenge a puzzle to solve. 

As she prepped the table for Mr. Hernandez, Amelia couldn't help but feel a familiar pang of frustration. Phoenix was overflowing with patients, each one battling their own demons. The hospital felt like a constant uphill battle, and sometimes Amelia wondered if she was making a difference at all.
