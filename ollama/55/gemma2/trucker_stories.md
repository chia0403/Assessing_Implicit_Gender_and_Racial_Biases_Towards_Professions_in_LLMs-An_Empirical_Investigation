The diner coffee was lukewarm at best, but it did the trick in clearing the cobwebs from Silas “Stone” Montgomery’s mind after twelve hours behind the wheel. Outside, dawn bled across the Kansas plains, painting the flat expanse in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple. The greasy spoon hummed with the usual pre-dawn chorus: clinking silverware, sizzling bacon, and the murmur of truckers swapping tired stories. 

Stone, a six-foot-four mountain of a man with a weathered face framed by thick salt-and-pepper hair, sat hunched over his mug, chewing on a toothpick. His eyes, the color of faded denim, scanned the faces around him, searching for something familiar in the sea of trucker hats and tired smiles. He wasn't looking for company; he preferred the solitude of the road. But sometimes, even a grizzled veteran like Stone needed to remind himself that he wasn't alone out here. 


This particular stretch of Highway 70 was always quiet, passing through towns barely clinging to existence and landscapes that stretched endlessly in every direction.  Stone felt a familiar pang of loneliness as he remembered his late wife, Clara, and how she used to fill these silent stretches with stories and laughter. He took another sip of coffee, the bitter liquid warming him from the inside out. It was time to get back on the road. Time to deliver his load of wheat to Chicago, and maybe, just maybe, find a little piece of solace in the rhythm of the engine and the endless horizon.
