The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and desperation in The Rusty Bucket.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon glow of the sign outside that promised "Live Music & Cheap Drinks." Detective Amelia 'Amy' Sinclair pushed through the heavy door, its rusted hinges groaning like a tired beast, and stepped into the murky world within. 

A cacophony of drunken laughter, off-key singing, and spilled beer assaulted her ears. The room was dimly lit, save for the flickering stage spotlight illuminating a skinny man with greasy hair wailing into a microphone. Amy scanned the room, her eyes settling on a figure hunched in a corner booth â€“ a hulking man with a shaved head and a scowl that could curdle milk. This was Tommy 'The Hammer' Harrington, known to frequent The Rusty Bucket after hours and notorious for his volatile temper. 

Amy had been called here by the owner, a nervous, sweaty man named Benny who claimed Harrington had threatened him after closing time. It wasn't unusual for Amy to find herself in seedy bars like this, dealing with petty disputes or chasing shadows of crime. But something about The Hammer and Benny's frantic call sent a prickle of unease down her spine. This could be more than just another night at the office.
