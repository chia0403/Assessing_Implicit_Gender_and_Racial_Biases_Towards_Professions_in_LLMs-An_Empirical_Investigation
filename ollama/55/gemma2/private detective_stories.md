Rain lashed against the grimy window of Bartholomew 'Bart' Blackwood's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. Bart himself was a blur too, hunched over his desk littered with half-empty coffee cups and crumpled cigarette packs, wrestling with a particularly stubborn crossword puzzle. He squinted at the clue: "Five-letter word for 'liar,' often found in a detective's arsenal." 

The answer, of course, was 'deceive'.  Bart sighed, stubbing out his cigarette and taking another swig of lukewarm coffee.  He wasn't particularly good at crosswords, but he knew liars like the back of his calloused hand. And that, more than anything else, made him a damn good private detective.

His office was a testament to this: a cramped, dimly lit space above a Chinese takeout joint in the seedier part of downtown Chicago. Walls were adorned with framed photographs of past cases - some triumphant, some tragic - and posters advertising everything from cheap whiskey to missing cats. The air hung thick with the smell of stale cigarettes, cheap cologne, and desperation.

Just as Bart was about to give up on the crossword and try his luck at a nap, the phone rang. He snatched it up, a weary sigh escaping his lips. "Blackwood Investigations," he rasped, his voice gravelly from years of smoking and late nights. 


"You've got a client waiting for you, Bart," a gruff voice said from the other end. It was Sal, the owner of the takeout joint below, and Bart's unofficial contact in the underworld.  

Bart narrowed his eyes. "A client? What time is it?"

"It's 3:00 AM, kid. You think I keep track of hours like a civilized man?"


Blackwood sighed, knowing that he wouldn't be getting any sleep tonight. He threw down the crossword puzzle and pulled on his worn leather jacket. It was time to face whatever trouble had found its way to his doorstep.
