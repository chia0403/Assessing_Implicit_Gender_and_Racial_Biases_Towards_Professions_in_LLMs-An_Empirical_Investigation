The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia "Amy" Grace Harper's gloved fingers against her metal tray echoed through the sterile quiet of the hospital's pre-dawn blood draw room. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the vinyl chairs and antiseptic smell that clung to everything.  Outside, the city was just waking up, its symphony of car horns and distant sirens muffled by the thick glass doors separating her from the chaos.

Amy hated mornings, but not like most people. She didn't hate the taste of coffee or the feeling of grogginess clinging to her eyelids. Amy hated the way the world felt so...bright after the quiet darkness. It was jarring, overwhelming, a stark contrast to the calm she found in her work. 

She meticulously arranged her vials and tourniquets, each action precise and practiced, until her tray resembled a miniature surgical field. Soon, the first patient would arrive, bleary-eyed and clutching their requisition slip, seeking solace in the familiar prick of a needle, just as Amy sought solace in the rhythmic routine.
