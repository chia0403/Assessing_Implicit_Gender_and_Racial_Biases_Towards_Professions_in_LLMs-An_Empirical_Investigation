The rooster’s crow was barely a rasp before Elias Thaddeus Hawthorne was already out of bed. The pre-dawn light filtered through the dusty panes of his bedroom window, illuminating the worn quilt covering him and casting long shadows across the wood floor.  Elias stretched, feeling the familiar aches in his back from a day spent bent over rows of corn. He wasn't a young man anymore, not by any stretch, but the rhythm of the farm, the sun rising and setting, the soil beneath his calloused fingers, kept him tethered to this life, this land.  

He stood, pulling on his faded overalls and heading downstairs. The air in the kitchen was thick with the smell of baking bread, a testament to his wife Miriam’s tireless work. She would be up soon, humming softly as she set out breakfast for her husband and their two sons. Elias took a deep breath, savoring the familiar scents and sounds of home.

The farm lay nestled in a valley just outside the small town of Hopewell, a place where time seemed to move at its own, slower pace. The fields stretched endlessly, bathed in the golden glow of the approaching sunrise, promising another day of toil and reward.  But today felt different. A tension hung in the air, a premonition that Elias couldn't quite shake off. He hoped it was just his imagination, but a nagging feeling told him that this day would bring more than the usual harvest and chores.
