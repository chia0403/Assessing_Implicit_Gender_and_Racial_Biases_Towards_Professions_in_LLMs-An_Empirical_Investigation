Professor Amelia Thistlewick squinted at the storm brewing outside her office window. Rain lashed against the glass, mimicking the frantic drumming of her own fingers on the worn oak desk. The air crackled with static electricity, making the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. It was a night for staying indoors, curled up with a good book and a steaming mug of tea. Instead, Amelia found herself wrestling with an article due tomorrow morning, its deadline looming like a menacing storm cloud. 

The setting: The University of Blackwood, a historic institution nestled deep in the Scottish Highlands. Its imposing Gothic architecture, shrouded in mist and driven by centuries-old secrets, mirrored the turbulent emotions swirling within Amelia's chest. She worked in the Department of Folklore and Myth, where she specialized in ancient Celtic tales and their uncanny echoes in modern life. 


The rain intensified, a symphony of howling wind and torrential downpour.  Amelia glanced at the clock. Midnight was fast approaching, blurring the lines between reality and the fantastical stories she dedicated her life to unraveling.
