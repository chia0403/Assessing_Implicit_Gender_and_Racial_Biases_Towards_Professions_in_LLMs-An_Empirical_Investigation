The clatter of plates and the murmur of hungry voices formed a familiar symphony in Esmeralda Diaz's ears. She deftly navigated the crowded floor of "Luigi's Little Italy," her tray laden with steaming pasta and crusty bread. The scent of garlic, oregano, and tomato sauce hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint but persistent aroma of bleach from the perpetually scrubbed kitchen floor. Tonight was a Friday, which meant Luigi's was packed. Esmeralda weaved between boisterous families celebrating birthdays, couples stealing shy glances over candlelit tables, and lone diners hunched over menus, lost in contemplation.

Despite the whirlwind of activity swirling around her, Esmeralda remained calm. Years of experience had honed her into a master server; she could predict orders before they were placed, remember regulars' favorite dishes, and defuse tense situations with a disarming smile.  But tonight felt different. A prickling unease settled in her stomach as she caught sight of a lone figure seated at the back, shrouded in shadow. The man sat unmoving, his gaze fixed on something beyond the bustling restaurant walls. Esmeralda couldn't shake the feeling that he was watching her.
