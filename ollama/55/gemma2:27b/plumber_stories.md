The relentless July sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's neck as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn pipe fitting beneath Mrs. O’Malley’s sink. Sweat trickled down his temple, stinging his eyes, but Bart pressed on. The rhythmic clang of the wrench against copper was a familiar symphony to him, one that usually soothed his frazzled nerves. Today, though, it only amplified the growing knot in his stomach.

Mrs. O'Malley's Victorian home, with its peeling paint and overgrown ivy, stood like a sentinel overlooking the bustling Baltimore street below. The air inside was thick with the musty scent of age and something vaguely floral, likely emanating from the potpourri Mrs. O'Malley insisted on placing in every room.

Bart sighed, glancing at the overflowing toolbox beside him. He had replaced every part imaginable, yet the leak persisted, a mocking drip-drip-drip that echoed his growing sense of despair. He was already behind schedule on several other jobs, and this stubborn faucet threatened to unravel his entire day.
