Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already bleak cityscape beyond. Inside, Amelia Harding, her auburn braid escaping its tie and falling across her shoulder, navigated the bustling therapy ward with practiced ease. The air hummed with the rhythmic whirring of exercise bikes, the soft clink of weights, and the determined grunts of patients pushing their limits.

Amelia, a seasoned occupational therapist known for her empathy and unwavering optimism, paused at Room 215. A wave of apprehension washed over her. Today was Michael's first day back in therapy after a devastating motorcycle accident had left him with severe nerve damage in his right leg. His future, once filled with dreams of becoming a professional musician, now hung precariously in the balance.

Taking a deep breath, Amelia entered the room, determined to help Michael reclaim not just his physical strength, but also the hope that seemed to have vanished along with his ability to play the guitar.
