Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Beatrice "Bea" Albright's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Stacks of W-2s and 1099s threatened to topple over, each form representing another anxious soul desperate for Bea to untangle their financial knots. April 15th loomed like a guillotine blade, and Bea, with her perpetually smudged glasses and caffeine-fueled determination, was the only one standing between her clients and the IRS's wrath.

Her office, nestled above a dusty bookstore on Elm Street, smelled faintly of old paperbacks and burnt coffee. Sunlight rarely pierced through the grime-coated windows, casting the room in a perpetual twilight. Yet, despite the dreary setting, Bea found solace in the rhythmic clatter of her keyboard and the quiet satisfaction of bringing order to financial chaos.

But this year was different. A mysterious envelope, addressed in elegant script, had arrived on Bea's doorstep the previous week. Inside lay a single sheet of paper: "They are watching," it read, followed by a string of seemingly random numbers.  Bea dismissed it as a prank at first, but a gnawing unease settled in her gut. Who were "they"? And what did those cryptic numbers mean? 

As the rain intensified outside, Bea knew she couldn't ignore this unsettling message. It was time to dig deeper, even if it meant venturing into territory far beyond her usual balance sheets and tax deductions.
