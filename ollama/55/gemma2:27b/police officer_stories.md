Rain lashed against Detective Isabella "Izzy" Rossi's trench coat as she surveyed the scene. The neon glow of the 'Lucky Dragon' casino sign flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows on the slick asphalt. A chalk outline shimmered under the harsh glare of the floodlights â€“ a grim reminder of the young woman found sprawled there just before dawn. Izzy sighed, the weight of another unsolved murder pressing down on her. This wasn't the first body to turn up in Chinatown this month, and the fear was palpable in the humid night air. 

She tucked a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear, her gaze sharp as she scanned the alleyway.  A discarded mahjong tile lay near the victim's hand, its intricate red dragon design mocking the tragedy that unfolded here. Izzy knew this case wouldn't be easy. Chinatown was a labyrinth of secrets and loyalties, where whispers travelled faster than bullets. She had a feeling this murder was just the tip of a very dangerous iceberg.
