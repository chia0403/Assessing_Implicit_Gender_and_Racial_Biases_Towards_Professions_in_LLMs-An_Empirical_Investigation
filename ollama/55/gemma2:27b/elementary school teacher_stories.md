The scent of chalk dust and stale crayons hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Mrs. Eloise Cartwright's third-grade classroom, illuminating a chaotic scene of half-finished art projects, scattered building blocks, and students buzzing like overexcited bees. Eloise sighed, her hand instinctively smoothing down the flyaway strands of her auburn hair as she surveyed the aftermath of their "Build Your Own Dream Castle" activity.

Her classroom, nestled in the heart of Willow Creek Elementary, was a haven of mismatched furniture, colorful posters depicting far-off lands and historical figures, and shelves overflowing with well-loved books. But today, even the cheerful clutter seemed to amplify the unsettling knot of anxiety twisting in Eloise's stomach. Something wasn't right. It started subtly – a whispered rumour in the hallway, a hesitant glance from a colleague – but now it felt like a storm cloud gathering over her head. 

Eloise knew she couldn't ignore it any longer. She had to find out what was going on, even if it meant facing her deepest fears.
