The acrid smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mixing unpleasantly with the metallic tang of blood. Evelyn Thorne, her brow slick with sweat despite the frigid air conditioning, pressed harder on the gauze covering the young man’s gaping wound. His breaths came in ragged gasps, each one a painful wheeze. 

Evelyn was used to chaos, used to working under pressure. As a physician's assistant in the ER of St. Jude’s Hospital, she thrived on adrenaline and urgency. But tonight felt different. The city had been plunged into darkness hours ago after a massive power outage, leaving St. Jude's running on backup generators, flickering lights casting long, unsettling shadows.

The young man groaned again, his eyes fluttering open for a fleeting moment before rolling back shut. Evelyn knew she needed to stabilize him quickly. The storm raging outside was only getting worse, and with every gust of wind that shook the hospital windows, her anxiety grew. They were running low on supplies, communication lines were down, and the other staff members were stretched thin.

She glanced at the clock ticking ominously above the doorway – 2:17 am. Evelyn had a sinking feeling this night was far from over.
