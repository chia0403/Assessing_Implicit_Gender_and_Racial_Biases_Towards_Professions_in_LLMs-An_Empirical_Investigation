The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a perfume Elias Thorne knew better than his own reflection. Dawn was just beginning to paint the eastern sky with streaks of lavender and rose as he trudged across the sprawling lawns of Blackwood Manor. Dew clung to the emerald blades, shimmering like scattered jewels. Elias, with his calloused hands and sun-weathered face, belonged to this landscape as much as the ancient oak trees that stood sentinel at its edges. He knew every twist and turn of the manicured pathways, every hidden nook where wildflowers dared to bloom.

Today, however, a disquiet hummed beneath the familiar peace. A strange stillness permeated the air, broken only by the distant cawing of crows. Even the usually boisterous sparrows seemed absent. And then there was the matter of the Manor itself. The grand windows, normally aglow with warm lamplight at this hour, were dark and lifeless.
