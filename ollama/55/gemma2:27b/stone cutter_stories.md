The midday sun beat down on Elias Thorne's stooped shoulders as he chipped away at the rough granite block. Dust swirled around his weathered boots, catching the golden light and turning it into a shimmering haze. The air was thick with the smell of sweat, stone dust, and the faint tang of salt from the nearby harbor.

Elias lived in the small, ramshackle village of Stonemantle, nestled against the cliffs on the windswept coast of Aethelgard. For generations, his family had carved their living out of the unforgiving rock that jutted from the earth like gnarled fingers. The quarry was a symphony of clanging hammers and rasping chisels, punctuated by the occasional gruff shout or exasperated sigh. It was a harsh but honest life, one Elias knew intimately. 

Today, he was working on a commission for the lord of Stonemantle Keep – a simple gargoyle to adorn the parapet.  But Elias's mind wasn't entirely focused on the task at hand. Lately, whispers had been traveling through the village like the sea wind – whispers of strange lights in the night sky and unsettling dreams that left villagers waking in cold sweats. Elias, ever the pragmatist, dismissed them as superstition. Yet, a nagging unease gnawed at him, something he couldn't quite explain.
