Rain lashed against the dusty windows of "Bargain Bites," blurring the flickering neon sign outside into a smear of pink and turquoise. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee and hot dogs rotating listlessly on a greasy spit. Eloise Cartwright sighed, her chin resting wearily on her hand as she stared out at the deserted parking lot. 

It was past midnight, and Eloise was alone in the store, save for Mr. Henderson, the ancient security guard who snored softly in his chair by the door. The silence was broken only by the rhythmic drip-drip from a leaky pipe somewhere in the back and the occasional whine of the fluorescent lights overhead. Eloise wished she could join Mr. Henderson in slumber, but her shift didn't end for another hour.

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, startling her awake. A figure emerged from the gloom, their face obscured by a hooded sweatshirt. Eloise straightened up, forcing a smile. "Welcome to Bargain Bites," she said, her voice betraying a hint of trepidation. "Can I help you find anything?"
