The insistent chirping of her antique desk phone yanked Elara Beaumont from her daydream about escaping to a Tuscan vineyard.  She sighed, smoothing down her sky-blue cardigan before picking up the receiver. "Good morning, Obsidian & Thorne, how may I direct your call?"

The air in the reception area was thick with the scent of old leather and mahogany polish. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above the plush crimson carpet.  Elara’s gaze swept across the imposing lobby: a grand chandelier sparkled overhead, casting intricate shadows on the marble floor; framed portraits of stern-faced men in powdered wigs stared down from the walls; and a roaring fire crackled merrily in the hearth, despite it being the middle of July. 

Obsidian & Thorne was an old-money law firm, steeped in tradition and whispers of shady dealings. Elara, fresh out of community college with dreams far grander than answering phones and scheduling appointments, had landed the receptionist position more by accident than design. But something about the firm's air of mystery intrigued her, and she couldn't help but feel a thrill every time a client walked through the heavy oak doors. 


Today, however, Elara felt the familiar pang of discontent settle in her stomach.  Another day, another endless stream of calls, appointments, and invoices. Perhaps a Tuscan vineyard wasn’t so unrealistic after all…
