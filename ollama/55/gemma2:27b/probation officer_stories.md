Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Evelyn "Evie" Thorne's office, blurring the already drab cityscape outside. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the stacks of files piled precariously on her desk. Evie sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. It was 6:30 pm, long past quitting time, but she was buried in paperwork, trying to catch up after a particularly grueling week dealing with parole violations and court appearances.

As a probation officer for the notoriously tough District 12, Evie's days were rarely easy. She walked a tightrope between enforcing the law and offering guidance to her clients, many of whom were struggling with addiction, poverty, and a history of trauma. Today's case was proving particularly challenging: a young man named Marco Rodriguez, recently released after serving time for petty theft. Marco was talented but troubled, constantly flirting with the edge of recidivism. Evie had seen potential in him, but she also knew how easily he could fall back into old habits. 


The phone on her desk buzzed, startling her. It was a call from Marco's mother, her voice frantic and tearful. "Evie," she pleaded, "Marco's gone missing. He hasn't come home. I'm scared something bad has happened."

A chill ran down Evie's spine. This wasn't just another missed curfew. Something felt deeply wrong.  She knew Marco wouldn't deliberately break contact with his mother, especially not after she'd worked so hard to support him through his probation.

Grabbing her raincoat, Evie steeled herself for a long night. She had a feeling this was just the beginning of a case that would test everything she believed in.
