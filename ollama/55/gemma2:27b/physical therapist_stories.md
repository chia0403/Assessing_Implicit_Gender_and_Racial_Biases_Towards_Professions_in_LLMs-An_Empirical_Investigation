Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her. The sterile white walls seemed to close in, amplifying the dull ache throbbing behind her left eye.  She stared out at the grey cityscape, the neon signs reflecting in the puddles below like fractured rainbows.

Her phone buzzed on her desk, the insistent chirping a stark contrast to the rhythmic drumming of the rain. It was another reminder – a meeting with her superiors about "streamlining" the clinic's services. Amy knew what that meant: budget cuts, potential layoffs, and further pressure to see more patients in less time.

She sighed, running a hand through her already tousled auburn hair. Being a physical therapist wasn't just a job for Amy; it was a calling. She thrived on helping people regain their mobility, their independence, witnessing the spark of hope rekindle in their eyes.  But lately, the system felt like it was actively working against her passion, turning healing into a hurried assembly line.

A knock at the door startled her. It was Elena, a young woman with vibrant green eyes and a smile that could light up a room – even a dreary one like this. "Ready for our session, Dr. Cartwright?" she asked, her voice tinged with both excitement and apprehension.


Amy forced a smile, trying to mask the worry gnawing at her insides.  "Absolutely, Elena," she said, rising from her chair. "Let's get started."
