The insistent buzz of the fluorescent lights above mirrored the thrumming anxiety in Dr. Elara Vance's chest. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the interrogation room, blurring the already bleak cityscape outside. It felt fittingly oppressive for the case she was about to face – a suspected serial arsonist whose chilling modus operandi had left three buildings reduced to smoldering rubble and an entire city on edge.

Elara traced the worn grooves on her mahogany desk, willing herself to remain calm. She'd dealt with countless criminals in her years as a forensic psychologist for the Seattle Police Department, but something about this case gnawed at her. The arsonist’s meticulous planning, the seemingly random targets, and the cryptic symbols left scrawled at each crime scene hinted at a mind far more complex – and potentially dangerous – than any she'd encountered before.
