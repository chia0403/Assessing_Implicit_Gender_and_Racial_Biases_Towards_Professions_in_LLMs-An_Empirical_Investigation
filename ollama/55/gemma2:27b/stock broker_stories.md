The aroma of burnt coffee hung heavy in Theodore "Theo" Alistair Blackwood III's office, a stark contrast to the crisp scent of money Theo usually preferred. It was 5:47 am, a time when most humans were still lost in the fog of sleep, but for Theo, it was just another Tuesday.

His mahogany desk, polished to a gleam that could rival the moon, was littered with charts and graphs, each line telling a story of risk and reward. Outside his floor-to-ceiling windows, the New York City skyline began to stir awake, skyscrapers stretching towards the pale pre-dawn sky like steel giants yearning for the sun.  

Theo's phone buzzed, the insistent vibration jarring him from his calculations. It was Alistair Blackwood Jr., his father and the founder of Blackwood Investments, a name synonymous with power and wealth in Wall Street circles. "Theo," the gruff voice boomed through the speaker, "have you got eyes on that lithium deal? We need to move before the market wakes up."

Theo glanced at the clock, a knot forming in his stomach. This was it. The deal that could make or break Blackwood Investments, and by extension, Theo's future.  He took a deep breath, the scent of burnt coffee suddenly nauseating, and reached for his mouse. Today, the city that never sleeps would witness Theo Blackwood rise.
