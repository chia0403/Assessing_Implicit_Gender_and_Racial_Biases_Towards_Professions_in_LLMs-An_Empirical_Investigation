The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda Delacroix like agitated wasps, casting a sickly yellow glow over the linoleum floor and the rows of plastic chairs in the waiting room. The scent of disinfectant mingled with the faint tang of fear, creating a familiar olfactory cocktail that Esmeralda had come to associate with her job as a phlebotomist at St. Jude's General Hospital.

Esmeralda sighed, adjusting the stethoscope draped around her neck. It was a Wednesday afternoon, and the waiting room was unusually empty. Usually, it buzzed with anxious patients clutching crumpled lab requisition forms and nervously tapping their feet. Today, however, only one figure occupied a seat â€“ a gaunt man with hollow eyes and hands that trembled slightly as he gripped a worn paperback. Esmeralda recognized him from previous visits. His name was Mr. Finch, and he always arrived for his blood work with the same haunted expression, like someone who carried a secret too heavy to bear.
