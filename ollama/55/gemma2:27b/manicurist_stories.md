The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and blooming jasmine, a heady perfume unique to Lavender & Lace Nail Salon. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating swirls of dust motes dancing above rows of gleaming polish bottles. Eloise Marie Dubois, her nimble fingers stained a delicate shade of rose quartz, hummed along to the soft jazz playing on the salon's speakers. Her client, Mrs. Henderson, a kindly woman with silver hair piled high atop her head like spun sugar, sighed contentedly as Eloise buffed her nails to a glossy sheen. Outside, the vibrant pulse of New Orleans throbbed â€“ street musicians crooning soulful melodies, the clatter of horse-drawn carriages on cobblestones, and the distant, rhythmic beat of a brass band.  But inside Lavender & Lace, time seemed to slow down. It was a haven, a place where worries dissolved under Eloise's gentle touch and the world outside faded into a soft blur. 

Yet today, a disquiet lingered beneath Eloise's usual calm. A sense of unease prickled at the back of her neck, a feeling amplified by the insistent ringing of the salon's antique telephone. She excused herself from Mrs. Henderson, who smiled understandingly, and picked up the receiver. The voice on the other end was unfamiliar, low and gravelly, sending a shiver down Eloise's spine. "Eloise Dubois?" it rasped, "There are things you need to know."
