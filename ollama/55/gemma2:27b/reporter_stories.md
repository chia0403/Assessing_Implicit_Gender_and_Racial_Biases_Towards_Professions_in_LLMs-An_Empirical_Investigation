The rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, mimicking the insistent thrumming in Eloise Moreau's chest. The flickering neon sign outside, proclaiming "Chez Gigi: Best Beignets This Side of the Mississippi," cast an oily sheen across her cluttered desk. Crumpled takeout containers jostled for space with stacks of dog-eared notebooks and half-written articles. Eloise chewed on the end of her pen, her gaze fixed on the grainy photograph spread out before her. A young woman, barely twenty, stared back with haunted eyes. Camille Dubois had been missing for three weeks, vanished without a trace from the heart of New Orleans' vibrant French Quarter. The police called it a runaway case, but Eloise knew better. Camille wasn't the type to disappear, not without leaving a single clue.

Eloise, a tenacious reporter for the struggling *Crescent City Chronicle*, had taken Camille's disappearance as her own personal crusade.  She felt a kinship with the missing girl, both drawn to the city's alluring underbelly and its secrets whispered in smoky backrooms and moonlit alleys.  Tonight, Eloise was meeting her contact, a shadowy figure known only as "Le Chat," who promised information about Camille's last known whereabouts. The rendezvous point was a dimly lit jazz club on Frenchmen Street, a place where music pulsed through the very walls and secrets hung thick in the air. 

Eloise grabbed her worn trench coat, the scent of stale coffee clinging to its fabric, and stepped out into the deluge.  She had a feeling tonight would be the night she finally got closer to the truth about Camille Dubois.
