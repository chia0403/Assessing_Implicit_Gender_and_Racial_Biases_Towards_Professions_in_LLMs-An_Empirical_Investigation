Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon signs of downtown Chicago into streaks of pink and blue.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Chen gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather. The siren's wail cut through the storm, a desperate plea for passage through the gridlocked traffic.

A call had come in just minutes ago: a multi-vehicle accident on Lake Shore Drive. Amy knew it would be bad; they always were in this weather. Her partner, Mark, sat beside her, his face grim as he reviewed the scant information they had â€“ multiple victims, potential entrapment. 


Amy's heart pounded against her ribs. Years of experience hadn't dulled the adrenaline rush that came with every emergency call. She thrived on it, on the urgency, the chance to make a difference in the face of chaos. But tonight, something felt different, heavier. A premonition, perhaps, whispered by the howling wind outside.
