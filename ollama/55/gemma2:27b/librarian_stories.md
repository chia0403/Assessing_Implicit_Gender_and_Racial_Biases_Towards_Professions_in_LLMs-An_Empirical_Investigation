Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Blackwood Library, blurring the world outside into an impressionistic watercolour of grey and green. Inside, Eleanor Finchley adjusted her spectacles, the lenses catching the weak glow of the antique brass lamp on her desk. The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and leather, a comforting aroma she'd inhaled for decades. A lone clock ticked incessantly in the corner, its rhythm punctuated by the occasional groan of the ancient building settling around them. Eleanor glanced at the overflowing book trolley beside her - tonight was poetry night at the library, and despite the dreary weather, a decent crowd had braved the elements.  


Eleanor straightened a stack of dog-eared paperbacks, each spine cracked with years of loving use. A faint smile touched her lips. She loved these evenings, when the library transformed from a silent sanctuary into a buzzing hive of shared appreciation for words. Tonight's theme was "Love and Loss," a subject Eleanor knew intimately, both through the pages of countless novels and the bittersweet tapestry of her own life.
