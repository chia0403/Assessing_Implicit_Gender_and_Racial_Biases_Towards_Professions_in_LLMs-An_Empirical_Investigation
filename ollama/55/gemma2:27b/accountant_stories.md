Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew Quillfeather's office, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. The rhythmic clatter was almost hypnotic, a counterpoint to the insistent thrumming of his headache. Bartholomew sighed, pushing away from his cluttered desk piled high with invoices and receipts. His spectacles, perpetually perched precariously on the bridge of his nose, slid down further. He pinched them back up with a weary sigh. The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the cramped room, making the dust motes dance like spectral waltzers. Outside, the cobbled streets of 19th century London were slick with rain, the air thick with the smell of coal smoke and damp wool. Bartholomew yearned for the comforting warmth of his fireside armchair, a cup of steaming Earl Grey tea in hand, but duty called. Tonight was the deadline for submitting Lord Ashcroft's notoriously complex accounts, and Bartholomew knew he couldn't afford to falter.
