The insistent clang of the trolley bell cut through the humid air, echoing off the ornate plasterwork of the Grand Astoria Hotel lobby. Elias Bartholomew "Eli" Finch grimaced, adjusting his grip on the handle as he wrestled the overloaded cart around a gaggle of giggling socialites. Their silk dresses swished like whispered secrets against their ankles, and their perfume hung thick in the air, battling for dominance with the scent of lilies from the massive vase near the reception desk.

Eli longed to be anywhere but here, navigating this sea of polished marble and forced smiles. He dreamed of dusty libraries, quiet corners filled with the smell of old paper, and stories whispered by the turning pages. But instead, he was stuck hauling luggage for entitled tourists who treated him like a glorified doormat.

Today, however, something felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, punctuated by hushed whispers among the staff. Even Mrs. Hathaway, the perpetually stern head housekeeper, seemed unusually agitated, her lips pressed into a thin line as she surveyed the bustling lobby. Eli knew something was brewing, something beyond the usual arrival of wealthy patrons and their mountains of impractical baggage.
