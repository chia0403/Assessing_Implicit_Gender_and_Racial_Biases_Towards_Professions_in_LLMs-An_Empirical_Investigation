The air hung heavy with cigarette smoke and the cloying sweetness of spilled beer.  Neon lights flickered erratically above the stage, casting long, distorted shadows across the cramped dive bar.  Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont adjusted the microphone stand, her fingers nervously tracing the worn leather. 

This wasn't the smoky, upscale jazz club she'd dreamt of playing in as a child, but it was a gig, and Ellie needed gigs. Bills piled up faster than melodies these days, and the landlord wasn't known for his patience. The bar, aptly named "The Rusty Trumpet," reeked of desperation and faded glory â€“ much like Ellie herself felt lately.

Tonight, she'd chosen songs that tugged at the heartstrings: bluesy ballads about lost love and gritty anthems about fighting for your dreams.  Maybe they wouldn't fill her pockets with gold, but perhaps they could touch someone in this sea of weary faces. Maybe tonight, Ellie Beaumont would find her voice again.
