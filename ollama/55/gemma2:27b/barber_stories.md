The rusted blade scraped against the chipped porcelain sink, sending a spray of soapy water onto Elias Bartholomew's already damp apron. He sighed, the sound lost in the clatter of the streetcar outside his shop window. The early morning sun, weak and watery through the London fog, cast long shadows across the worn leather chairs lining the wall. Elias ran a hand over his thinning hair, the familiar ache settling in his lower back. Another day, another dozen faces, another endless cycle of snipping and shaving.

He longed for something more. Something beyond the predictable rhythms of clippers buzzing and hot towels steaming. He yearned for adventure, for stories beyond those whispered by weary dockworkers and gossiping housewives. But here he was, Elias Bartholomew, barber extraordinaire, forever tethered to his small shop on Drury Lane.
