The humid Florida air clung to Elias Blackwood like a second skin as he surveyed his latest project – a sprawling estate in Boca Raton with more bougainvillea than sense. Palm trees, already impossibly tall, stretched towards the cloudless sky, casting long shadows across the manicured lawn. A chorus of cicadas filled the silence, their relentless chirping a soundtrack to Elias's frustration.

He wasn't sure why Mrs. Van Derlyn insisted on having her hibiscus bushes trimmed into perfect cones – it felt unnatural, like forcing a wild animal into a cage. Still, a job was a job, and Elias needed the money. He ran his calloused hand over the rough bark of a nearby ficus tree, its leaves rustling in the warm breeze.

This wasn't what Elias had envisioned for himself. Back in Vermont, he'd dreamed of designing sprawling gardens filled with native plants, not these manicured monstrosities favored by Boca Raton's elite. But life had a way of derailing even the best-laid plans.

As Elias reached for his pruning shears, a glint of metal caught his eye – half buried beneath a cluster of vibrant bougainvillea blooms lay a small, silver locket. Curiosity piqued, he knelt down and gently brushed away the dirt, revealing an ornate design etched into its surface.
