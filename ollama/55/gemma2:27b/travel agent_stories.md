Rain lashed against the dusty storefront window, blurring the faded "Wanderlust Travel" sign above it. Inside, Evangeline "Evie" Dubois sighed, drumming her fingers on the chipped countertop. The rhythmic clatter was the only sound besides the insistent drumming of the rain and the occasional groan from the ancient air conditioner struggling to fight the humid July heat. 

Evie's office was a far cry from the exotic locales she sold. Cracked linoleum floors, mismatched furniture salvaged from yard sales, and travel posters peeling at the edges barely hinted at the vibrant destinations she longed to visit herself. But today, even the allure of turquoise waters and snow-capped mountains couldn't pierce the fog of disappointment settling over her. Her phone hadn't rung all morning, not a single booking inquiry. It was becoming increasingly clear that her dream of running a successful travel agency was slipping away like grains of sand through her fingers.

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, startling Evie from her reverie. A figure stepped inside, momentarily silhouetted against the rain-streaked window.  Evie straightened up, a flicker of hope rekindling in her eyes. Maybe this was it, the client who would turn her luck around.
