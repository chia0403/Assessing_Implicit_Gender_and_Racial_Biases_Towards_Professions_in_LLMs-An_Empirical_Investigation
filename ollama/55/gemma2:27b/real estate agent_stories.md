The acrid scent of chlorine hung heavy in the air, mixing unpleasantly with the cloying sweetness of overripe mangoes from the street vendor next door. Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz winced as she adjusted her sunglasses, squinting at the turquoise monstrosity before her. The pool, more accurately described as a glorified kiddie pool, was the centerpiece of this "luxury condo," a term Esme used loosely. 

The building itself loomed over the narrow street, a concrete behemoth painted in peeling shades of beige and salmon pink. Palm trees, stunted and sickly from the constant exhaust fumes, struggled for life in terracotta pots along the walkway. This wasn't exactly the beachfront paradise Esme had envisioned selling when she'd decided to become a real estate agent in Miami Beach.  But hey, desperate times called for desperate measures, and this month's mortgage payment was looming.
