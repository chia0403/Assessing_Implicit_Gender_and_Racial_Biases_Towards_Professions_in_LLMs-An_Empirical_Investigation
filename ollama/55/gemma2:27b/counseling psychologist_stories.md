Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office, mimicking the storm raging inside her patient, a young man named Liam whose shoulders shook with silent sobs.  Eleanor’s small, book-lined office on the third floor of an old Victorian building overlooking a rain-slicked alleyway felt suffocatingly close. The scent of sandalwood incense, usually calming, seemed to amplify the tension in the air. Eleanor leaned forward, her gaze soft and steady, "Liam, it's okay to let it out." 

She knew Liam’s story was a tragic one. A promising musician whose dreams had been shattered by a devastating accident that left him physically scarred and emotionally crippled. Today, he had finally broken down, the dam of his grief overflowing after months of bottled-up pain. Eleanor, with her years of experience guiding others through their darkest moments, braced herself for the torrent of emotions about to be unleashed.
