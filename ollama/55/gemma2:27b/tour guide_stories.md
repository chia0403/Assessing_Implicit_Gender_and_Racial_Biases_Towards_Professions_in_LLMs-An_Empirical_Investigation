The midday Cairo sun beat down on Esmeralda al-Amin's already sweat-dampened linen shirt. Tourists huddled under the meager shade offered by the Sphinx, their faces contorted in a mixture of awe and discomfort. 

"And as you can see," Esmeralda gestured towards the monument's weathered face, her voice amplified by a handheld speaker, "the Sphinx has been guarding the Pyramids for millennia..." Her words trailed off as she noticed the glazed-over expressions of her group. This was the third tour today, and even her usually enthusiastic spiel about ancient Egypt felt stale under the relentless heat.  

Today, Esmeralda longed for the cool embrace of the Cairo Museum, surrounded by pharaohs' treasures instead of tourists' complaints. But bills needed paying, and guiding tours was the only way to afford her dream: opening a small caf√© overlooking the Nile, serving cardamom coffee and baklava to weary travelers.
