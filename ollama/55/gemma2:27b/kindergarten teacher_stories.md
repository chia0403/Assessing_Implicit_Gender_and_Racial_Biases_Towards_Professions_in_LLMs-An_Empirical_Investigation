Crayon drawings adorned every surface, miniature tables were strewn with half-finished puzzles and building blocks, and the air buzzed with the excited hum of children engaged in their morning activities. But beneath the cheerful facade, Amelia felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach.
