Grease clung to Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's fingers like stubborn barnacles. The midday sun beat down on the corrugated metal roof of her garage, "Diaz Auto," turning the already stifling air into a sauna.  The scent of motor oil and burnt rubber hung heavy, punctuated by the insistent clang of Esmeâ€™s wrench against a rusted bolt. She was wrestling with a vintage Mustang, its cherry red paint faded to the hue of dried blood, a testament to years spent neglected in a dusty barn. 

Esme wasn't one for fancy cars. Give her a dented pickup truck with a sputtering engine any day. But this Mustang, with its sleek lines and whispered promises of speed, held a certain allure. It was a challenge, a puzzle begging to be solved.  And Esme loved nothing more than cracking the code of a broken machine.
