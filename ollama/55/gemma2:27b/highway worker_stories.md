The asphalt shimmered under the unforgiving July sun, radiating heat waves that danced in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's peripheral vision. He squinted, adjusting his battered Stetson hat further down over his brow. Around him, the endless ribbon of Interstate 80 stretched eastwards towards the distant, hazy mountains, a constant reminder of the monotonous task ahead: filling a yawning pothole with steaming asphalt mix.

Bart wasn't one for complaints. He'd spent twenty years laying down roads across this vast country, each mile a testament to his calloused hands and unwavering work ethic. But today, the heat was relentless, even for a seasoned highway worker like him. Sweat stung his eyes, soaking through his worn cotton t-shirt.  He sighed, hefting the heavy shovel and plunging it into the steaming black asphalt mix, ready for another grueling hour under the scorching Nevada sun.
