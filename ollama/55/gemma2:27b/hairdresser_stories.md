The insistent chirp of her alarm dragged Celeste Marie Beaumont from a dream filled with cascading auburn curls and rebellious frizz. She slapped at the snooze button, a groan escaping her lips. 6:00 AM. The ungodly hour when the scent of burnt coffee battled the lingering aroma of last night's lavender shampoo in her tiny apartment above "Curl Up & Dye," the hair salon she'd poured her heart and soul into building.

Sunlight, already streaming through the gaps in her flimsy curtains, illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, a gentle reminder that even dreams couldn't escape the mundane realities of running a business. Today was a Saturday, usually their busiest day, and Celeste had a packed schedule: Mrs. Goldberg's weekly perm, Mr. Sanchez's desperately needed trim (rumor had it he hadn't seen scissors since his last divorce), and then the bridal party for the Henderson wedding. 

Celeste sighed. She loved making people feel beautiful, transforming them with a flick of her wrist and the right shade of dye. But sometimes, the weight of expectations, bills, and perpetually tangled hairbrushes felt heavier than any head full of unruly curls she'd ever encountered.
