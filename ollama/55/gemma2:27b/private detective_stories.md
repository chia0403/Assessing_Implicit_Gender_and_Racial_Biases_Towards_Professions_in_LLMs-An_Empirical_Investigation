Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. Inside his cramped office, Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood tapped a greasy cigarette against the overflowing ashtray on his desk. The air hung heavy with stale smoke and desperation â€“ a scent Teddy knew intimately.

A worn map of Chicago lay spread across the chipped surface, its creases marking years of hard-boiled cases.  A half-empty bottle of rye whiskey sat beside it, promising oblivion but offering only a temporary reprieve from the gnawing emptiness in Teddy's gut. The door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a woman cloaked in shadow.
