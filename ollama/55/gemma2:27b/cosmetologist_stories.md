The air hung thick with the smell of coconut oil and burnt hairspray.  A disco ball cast fractured rainbows across the cramped salon floor, reflecting off the chrome of styling chairs and the chipped porcelain sink. Eleanor "Ellie" Moreau sighed, her reflection in the dusty mirror distorted by the swirling lights.

It was a Tuesday afternoon, the slowest time of week at "Shear Brilliance," Ellie's family-owned salon nestled on a forgotten corner of Canal Street in New Orleans. The humidity clung to her like a second skin, making her carefully styled curls frizz despite the industrial-strength hairspray she'd used. 

Ellie stared at the lone customer perched in her chair, an elderly woman with a helmet of silver hair and eyes that seemed permanently surprised.  Mrs. Dubois was a regular, requesting the same rinse-and-set every week for the past decade. Ellie didn't mind; Mrs. Dubois always brought homemade beignets, which were far more appealing than the usual clientele of college girls demanding "mermaid hair" or men desperate for a quick trim before their Tinder dates.


But today, something felt different. A low thrumming vibrated through the floorboards, barely audible above the whirring hairdryer. Ellie glanced at Mrs. Dubois, who seemed unfazed, her gaze fixed on a faded copy of "People" magazine.

Then, a sudden clang echoed from the back room, followed by a muffled curse. Ellie's heart leaped into her throat. Something wasn't right.
