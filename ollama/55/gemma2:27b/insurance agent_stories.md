Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street.  A symphony of car horns and distant sirens played out beneath Bartholomew Quincy "Bart" Fitzwilliam's heavy sigh. It was nights like this that Bart questioned his career choice. Sure, selling insurance wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills.

The flickering fluorescent light above cast long shadows in his cramped office cubicle. Stacks of paperwork teetered precariously on his desk, threatening to engulf him entirely. His phone, a battered relic from the early 2000s, buzzed incessantly with unanswered calls, each one representing another potential client Bart had failed to convince.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation.

Bart rubbed his weary eyes, gazing out at the relentless downpour. He longed for a change, an escape from this mundane existence. He dreamed of adventure, of something beyond spreadsheets and actuarial tables. Little did he know that fate had a peculiar way of answering dreams, even those whispered in the dead of night.  

Tonight, his life was about to take an unexpected turn.
