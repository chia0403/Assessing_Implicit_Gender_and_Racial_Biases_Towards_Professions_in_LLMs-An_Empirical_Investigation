The air in Grimbly's Meats hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy aroma of curing salt. Sunlight, filtered through greasy window panes, painted stripes across the sawdust-covered floor. Bartholomew "Bart" Grimshaw, his apron stained crimson like a battlefield map, hefted a side of beef onto the butcher block with a grunt. The rhythmic thud of cleaver on bone echoed in the otherwise silent shop, punctuated by the occasional squeak of rusty hinges. Outside, the cobbled streets of Oakhaven bustled with the midday rush, but inside Bart's world, time seemed to slow, measured only by the methodical dissection of flesh and bone. 

Bart wasn't a man given to idle chatter or flowery sentiments. He possessed a stoicism honed through years of solitude and the grim reality of his trade. Yet, today, a flicker of unease danced in his steely grey eyes. The delivery this morning had beenâ€¦odd. A crate, unmarked and smelling faintly of sulfur, delivered by a hooded figure who vanished into the alley before Bart could utter a word. Inside lay a singular, impossibly large pig's head, its tusks curled like wicked scimitars, and its vacant eyes staring accusingly up at the ceiling.
