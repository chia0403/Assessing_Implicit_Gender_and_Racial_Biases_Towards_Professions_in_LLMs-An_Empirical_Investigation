Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's ER, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor Ainsworth.  Her hands, normally steady as she threaded IV lines and administered medication, trembled slightly as she reviewed Mr. Henderson's chart for the tenth time. He was crashing, his vitals plummeting faster than the rain outside.  Eleanor felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in her stomach. This wasn't just another shift at St. Jude's, the city's perpetually understaffed and overwhelmed hospital. This was personal.

Mr. Henderson was more than a patient to Eleanor â€“ he was her neighbor, the gruff but kind old man who always shared his prize-winning tomatoes from his rooftop garden.  She couldn't bear the thought of losing him, not like this, not when she felt powerless to stop it. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unsettling pallor on everything in the cramped cubicle. The smell of disinfectant mingled with the metallic tang of fear, a pungent cocktail that Eleanor knew all too well.  She had dedicated her life to saving others, but tonight, doubt gnawed at her.
