The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the grimy linoleum floor. Elias Finch squinted against the glare as he pushed his ancient mop across the sticky residue left by spilled cola and forgotten fries.  

He worked the graveyard shift at the Starlight Diner, a greasy spoon clinging to life in the shadow of a towering skyscraper. The diner had seen better days; its red vinyl booths were cracked and faded, the chrome counters dull with age. But Elias knew every inch of it, every creak of the floorboards, every wobble in the jukebox.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A chill crept through the diner despite the humid summer air, raising goosebumps on Elias's arms. The usual symphony of crickets and distant traffic was replaced by an eerie silence. Even the neon sign outside flickered uncertainly, casting long, distorted shadows across the asphalt. 


Elias paused, his mop suspended mid-air. He glanced at the clock ticking away above the counter.

2:17 AM.

He shrugged it off as fatigue. Graveyard shifts had a way of messing with your senses. Still, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
