Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's rural clinic, blurring the already fading light of dusk into an impressionistic watercolour. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the old tin roof and sending shivers down Eleanorâ€™s spine. She sighed, her breath fogging the glass as she peered out at the storm-wracked landscape.  

Her small veterinary practice, nestled on the edge of sleepy Blackwood Creek, was usually bustling with activity. But tonight, it was eerily quiet. The phone hadn't rung once since lunchtime, and the only sound besides the wind was the rhythmic ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner. Eleanor missed the familiar symphony of barks, meows, and chirps that normally filled the air.

A sudden, jarring clang from the back yard startled her. Eleanor grabbed a flashlight and cautiously pushed open the door, the storm's fury immediately engulfing her. The rain stung her face like icy needles, and she squinted into the darkness.  There, huddled beneath the shelter of the old oak tree, was a large dog, shivering and whimpering.
