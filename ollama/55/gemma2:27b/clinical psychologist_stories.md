Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the torrent of emotions swirling inside her chest. The clock on the wall ticked with cruel indifference, each second dragging her further into the abyss of doubt and despair. Her once-organized desk was now a battlefield of crumpled patient files and half-empty coffee mugs, reflecting the chaos that had become her life. Eleanor, usually a beacon of calm and reason for her patients, felt adrift in a sea of uncertainty.

The quaint Victorian building she called her practice housed the quiet desperation of countless souls. The peeling paint and creaky floorboards whispered tales of forgotten dreams and hidden traumas.  But today, even the familiar comfort of these walls couldn't quell the storm raging within Eleanor. She had just received news that would forever alter the course of her career â€“ a formal complaint filed against her by a former patient, accusing her of malpractice.
