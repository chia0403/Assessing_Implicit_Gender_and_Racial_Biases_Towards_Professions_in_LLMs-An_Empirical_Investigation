The air in the opulent lobby buzzed with hushed whispers and the clinking of champagne flutes. Amelia Beaumont, Chief Concierge of The Grand Aurelian, navigated the sea of silk gowns and tailored suits with practiced grace. Her crisp black uniform, accented by a shimmering gold brooch shaped like an aurelian flower, spoke volumes about her position - she was the gatekeeper to the desires and whims of the hotel's most discerning clientele. Tonight, however, Amelia felt a discordant note in the symphony of luxury.

No, this unease stemmed from a cryptic message she’d received that morning, delivered by a gaunt courier with eyes like polished obsidian: "The peacock will shed its feathers at midnight." 

The Grand Aurelian was known for its elaborate avian-themed décor, a shimmering tribute to the city's history as a haven for migratory birds. But what did it mean? A prank? An obscure threat? Amelia's mind raced with possibilities as she surveyed the ballroom, awash in golden light and dotted with exotic floral arrangements. The clock on the far wall ticked relentlessly towards midnight.
