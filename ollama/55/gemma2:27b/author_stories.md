Rain lashed against the attic windows, each gust a miniature explosion against the warped glass. Agatha Penhaligon shivered, pulling her shawl tighter around her thin shoulders. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through a crack in the boarded-up windowpane, illuminating the chaotic jumble of old trunks, forgotten toys, and stacks of yellowed manuscripts that filled the attic space. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wood and mildew, punctuated by the faint, sweet aroma of lavender emanating from Agatha's shawl. 

Agatha sighed, her breath fogging in the chilly air. For months she'd been wrestling with writer's block, her once-fertile imagination now as barren as the overgrown garden outside.  She had retreated to this dusty attic, hoping the solitude and melancholic atmosphere would spark a flicker of inspiration.
