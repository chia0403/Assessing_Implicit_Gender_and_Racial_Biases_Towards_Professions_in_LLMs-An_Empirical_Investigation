The scent of lilies, sharp and sweet, hung heavy in the air of "Flora & Fauna", Amelia Roseweather's haven of blooms and greenery.  Sunlight streamed through the shop window, illuminating dust motes dancing above displays overflowing with vibrant hydrangeas, delicate orchids, and sunflowers bursting with sunshine. Outside, cobblestone streets bustled with the morning rush; vendors hawked their wares, pigeons squabbled over breadcrumbs, and carriages clattered past, leaving behind a faint aroma of horse manure. Amelia, her auburn braids escaping from their intricate twist, hummed a cheerful tune as she carefully arranged crimson roses into a heart-shaped bouquet for a lovestruck customer.

But beneath the surface of her floral paradise, Amelia felt a growing unease. Strange deliveries had been arriving at the shop â€“ unmarked crates containing exotic blooms unlike any she'd seen before: orchids with iridescent petals, lilies that pulsed with an inner light, and vines that seemed to writhe with a life of their own.  And then there were the whispered rumours spreading through the market - tales of forgotten magic stirring in the city, of ancient powers returning after centuries of slumber.
