Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Smiles for Miles", blurring the already fading neon sign into an impressionistic smear. Amelia Rose Carmichael sighed, her reflection staring back from the stainless steel countertop â€“ tired eyes rimmed with red, a stray curl escaping her meticulously styled bun. The Tuesday afternoon slump had hit hard, and the relentless drumming on the glass only amplified her weariness.

Cleaning, polishing, flossing - the endless cycle was starting to wear on her soul. Amelia loved helping people maintain their oral health, but lately, she couldn't shake this nagging feeling that there was something more out there for her, something beyond the sterile confines of "Smiles for Miles".
