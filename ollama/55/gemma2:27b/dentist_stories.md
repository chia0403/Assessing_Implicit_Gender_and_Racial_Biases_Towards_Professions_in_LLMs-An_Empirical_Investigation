Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's Victorian dental practice, blurring the intricate depictions of grinning molars and gleaming canines into abstract splashes of color. The wind howled down Elm Street, rattling the old oak tree outside her window and sending shivers through Evelyn's thin cotton blouse. It was a night made for curling up with a good book and a steaming cup of tea, not for drilling teeth.

Evelyn sighed, pushing away the image of a crackling fireplace and returning her attention to the x-ray flickering on the screen in front of her. The molars of her 8 o'clock appointment, young Mr. Alistair Finch, were a mess - cavities rampant, fillings crumbling like ancient ruins.  She tapped her pen against the countertop, contemplating the best course of action. This wasn't just routine decay; there was something unusual about the pattern, something...almost deliberate.

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing Alistair Finch's arrival. Evelyn straightened up, a professional smile forming on her lips as she turned to greet him.  But as Alistair stepped into the waiting room, casting a nervous glance around the dimly lit space, Evelyn couldn't help but notice something odd about his demeanor. He seemedâ€¦afraid.
