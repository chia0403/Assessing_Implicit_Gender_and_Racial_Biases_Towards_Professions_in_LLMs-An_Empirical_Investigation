Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, mirroring the tempest brewing within her.  The aroma of lavender oil, usually so calming, did little to soothe her frayed nerves. Her practice, nestled in the quaint coastal town of Seahaven, was struggling. Bills piled up on her desk like forgotten driftwood, and the once-bustling waiting room now echoed with an unnerving silence. 

Evelyn stared out at the grey, churning sea, its ceaseless roar a stark reminder of the relentless tide of anxiety threatening to engulf her. She'd poured her heart and soul into building this practice, leaving behind the sterile predictability of a big-city clinic for the promise of community and connection. But Seahaven, with its aging population and pervasive skepticism towards "alternative medicine," had proven a tougher nut to crack than she'd anticipated.
