Rain lashed against the frosted glass windowpanes of "Tranquility Touch," obscuring the twinkling lights strung across the old oak tree in Eleanor Winthrop's backyard. The warm scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, battling the chill that seeped through the cracks in the antique doorframe. Eleanor, her hands calloused but gentle, kneaded a knot in the shoulder of Mrs. Henderson, whose sigh echoed the mournful howl of the wind outside.

Eleanor wasn't just any massage therapist. She possessed an uncanny ability to sense not only physical tension but also the emotional knots that bound her clients.  Today, however, even Eleanor felt a peculiar disquiet, a prickling awareness that something was amiss beyond the blustering storm raging around them.
