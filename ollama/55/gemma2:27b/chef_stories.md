The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and woodsmoke, a familiar comfort to Elias Thorne, head chef of The Rusty Kettle. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh were slick with rain, reflecting the dim glow of gaslights like fractured jewels. Inside the restaurant, however, warmth emanated from the roaring hearth in the corner, its flames dancing merrily as Elias meticulously chopped shallots. 

His kitchen was a symphony of clanging pots, sizzling pans, and muffled shouts - the usual controlled chaos that came with running one of the city's most beloved gastropubs. But tonight, something felt different. An unsettling tension thrummed beneath the surface, a discordant note in the familiar melody. It began with the delivery of an unusual package earlier that afternoon â€“ a plain wooden crate addressed simply to "Elias Thorne."  Now it sat on a prep table, its contents shrouded in mystery and emitting a faint, herbal scent that both intrigued and unnerved him.
