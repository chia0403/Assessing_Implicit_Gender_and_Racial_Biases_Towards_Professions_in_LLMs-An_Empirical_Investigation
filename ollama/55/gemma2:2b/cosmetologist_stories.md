The bell above the door chimed with a dull thud, breaking the silence of Amelia's salon like a startled bird's wings.  Amelia, or "Amy" as her clients insisted on calling her, glanced up from her latest concoction - an iridescent purple hair dye she was still experimenting with – and saw Mrs. Peterson entering. The woman had been coming to Amy for years, always meticulously combing through the salon's glossy floor-to-ceiling display of beauty products before settling into her usual chair by the window. 

The salon was bathed in a warm golden light filtering through the sheer curtains that lined the windows. A cascade of silk cushions adorned with floral patterns lay scattered about the waiting area, and the air itself felt like a haven – a world away from the hustle and bustle of the city outside. Amy's little corner of New Orleans felt particularly safe. 

The aroma of jasmine and rosewater wafted in from the backroom where she was working her magic on Mrs. Peterson’s hair - a stark contrast to the harsh fumes of gasoline that clung to the air just a few blocks away in the bustling French Quarter.  Amy took a deep breath, savouring the sweet scent before turning back to her client's reflection.
