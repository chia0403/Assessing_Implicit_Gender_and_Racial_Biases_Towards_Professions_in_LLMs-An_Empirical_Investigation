The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thorne's head like restless cicadas as she surveyed the sprawling high school courtyard.  She had always found solace in the chaos – the clashing uniforms, the awkward laughter echoing off lockers, the frenetic energy of students navigating their way through adolescence. But today, even the usual symphony felt discordant. The air hung thick with an oppressive silence, punctuated only by the panicked drumming of a teenager's fingers against his desk. 

Amelia, or Mrs. Thorne as she was known to most teenagers, adjusted her spectacles and took a deep breath.  The name on the door said “Mr. Jones” – but Amelia had been dealing with more than just usual teenage angst for years now. As the school counselor at Westview High, she'd seen it all: love letters written in code that held secrets worse than any Shakespearean tragedy, whispered rumors of a budding scandal involving two star athletes, and anxieties so deep they threatened to drown entire classrooms. 

She pushed open the door, her smile as reassuring as the worn wooden desk inside. “Mr. Jones,” she called softly, "what's going on?"  The boy's gaze lifted, startled by her sudden appearance. He clutched a crumpled piece of paper in his hands, and Amelia felt a familiar pang of empathy for this young soul struggling against the storm.
