Rain pattered against the glass roof of Mrs. Elara Thorne's classroom like tiny fists on a drumhead. Outside, the world was grey, mirroring the mood in her little corner of it. It had been five weeks since Mr. Finnigan, her beloved colleague and best friend, had left for his new job across town – a job that promised "more responsibility" and "better pay," as he'd said with a sad shake of his head before packing up their shared classroom materials.  Five weeks since the laughter and familiar chaos of her classroom had been replaced by a heavy silence. 

Mrs. Thorne was meticulously arranging a rainbow of wooden blocks, each one bearing an alphabet letter on its side. They were meant to be a centerpiece for "Letterland," her grand plan to revive the playful spirit in her class after Mr. Finnigan's departure.  She couldn't help but notice the small, hand-drawn picture tucked behind one block - a single heart with a teardrop drawn in crimson ink. It was from little Lily, whose voice had been silenced by a recent family trauma. A reminder that this "Letterland" project wasn’t just about learning the alphabet; it was about rediscovering joy amidst a sea of sorrow.
