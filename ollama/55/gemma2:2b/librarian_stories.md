## The Whispering Stacks

**Setting:**  The Grand Blackwood Library, a sprawling Victorian edifice in the heart of London, England. Built by generations of wealthy benefactors, it’s now home to an unruly collection of over 10 million volumes and countless whispers carried on the drafts from forgotten centuries.

**Character:** Amelia Hawthorne, a woman with eyes that held the deep green of unpolished emeralds and a silver tongue as sharp as the antique tools she used for cataloging. She'd been librarian at Blackwood for fifteen years, but each day felt like an adventure in its own right, a treasure hunt through dusty volumes and forgotten histories. 

**Opening:** Amelia adjusted her spectacles, their brass rims gleaming faintly under the library’s dim gaslights. The worn pages of “The History of British Folklore” lay open on her desk, yet another story she knew by heart - but one that was always waiting to be unfolded anew. Her eyes fell upon a single word underlined in crimson: "Shadow." 

This wasn't just any shadow from the faded illustrations; it felt heavy, palpable, as if someone had written it with fear itself. A shiver ran down Amelia’s spine. The Blackwood Library held secrets, whispered from its very stones and echoed within each dusty volume.  And this time, she was sure she would find something truly remarkable, perhaps even...unpleasant.
