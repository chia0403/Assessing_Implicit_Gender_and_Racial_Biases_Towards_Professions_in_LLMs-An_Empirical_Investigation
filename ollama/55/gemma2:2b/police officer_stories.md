The neon sign above **Inspector Alistair Thorne's** weathered office cast an oily sheen over the rain-soaked asphalt as he stared at the flickering news feed on his desk lamp. "City Hall Riot - Suspect Escapes," it blared in bold letters.  A low whistle escaped his lips, a sound that was both tired and weary in this city of constant chaos. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and fear. It had been a long shift already – 4:00 AM when he'd woken up for his routine patrol, and it felt like it was only just beginning, even as the sun climbed higher in the sky.

His precinct, nestled into the bowels of a towering concrete structure that seemed to be perpetually under construction, housed some of the city's most volatile cases. It wasn’t just the city itself; it was an internal storm brewing within Inspector Thorne himself. The riot at City Hall – a spectacle of anger and frustration, fueled by years of simmering discontent – had shaken him to his core. For years, he’d dedicated himself to this city, its streets like an intricate web he navigated with his badge and his weary heart. But tonight, the web felt more tangled, the threads too frayed for comfort. 

The door creaked open as a nervous rookie, barely out of training school, entered. "Thorne, sir," he said, holding up a crumpled report. "Another one." The words hung in the air like dust motes dancing on moonlight.
