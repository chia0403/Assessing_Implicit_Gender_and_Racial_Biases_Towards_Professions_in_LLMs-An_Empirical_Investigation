## The Red Room

The air in "The Red Room" was thick with the scent of disinfectant and the rhythmic hum of a vintage blood pressure monitor.  A faint, sickly sweet smell lingered - the perfume of fear. 34-year-old Amelia Thorne adjusted her mask and took a deep breath. It was Friday night, and that meant more than just the usual influx of worried faces and panicked shouts.  This was Dr. Hawthorne's "special occasion," where he held what was essentially an underground blood drive for his patients. An unconventional practice that usually drew only the most desperate souls; those who couldn’t afford standard treatment, or whose ailments were so severe they defied conventional methods.

The room itself wasn't much to look at – worn linoleum floors, a single lamp casting harsh shadows on the collection of medical instruments arranged like soldiers in a forgotten war.  But Amelia knew the red room held more than just blood and needles. It held the secrets of men and women caught in a battle they couldn’t win, their fear whispered down through the silent air.  Tonight, she had her hands full; a young woman with swollen knuckles clutching a worn locket and a story too painful to hear. The red room was not only a place of blood donation; it was a witness to human suffering.
