The air hung thick with sawdust and the promise of rain. Rain that would soak into the wood beneath Elias Thorne's calloused hands. Elias was a man forged in the fires of his craft; he lived and breathed the scent of cedar and pine, knew the quiet creak of oak better than the rhythm of his own heartbeat. His workshop, nestled amongst towering redwoods on the edge of Redwood Creek, was his sanctuary.  

He wasn't just a carpenter; Elias was a craftsman. Every piece that left his workshop carried more than just wood; it carried stories carved by years of sweat and toil, dreams held in the grain of aging oak. The storm clouds gathered over Redwood Creek, their shadows stretching long across the valley floor. They were angry, whispering secrets on the wind as they churned the air thick with a tangible anticipation of rain.  

Tonight, Elias was working on a commission; an ornate wooden chest for a young widower whose wife had passed away recently. His fingers moved with practiced grace, smoothing over the last rough edges before he'd stain the wood and begin the intricate carving, each stroke echoing her memory.
