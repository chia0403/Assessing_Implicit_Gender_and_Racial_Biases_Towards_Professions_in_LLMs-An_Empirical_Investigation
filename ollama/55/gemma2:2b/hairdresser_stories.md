## The Scent of Old Roses

**Opening:** 

A gentle rustle from behind the frosted glass door marked the start of another Tuesday morning at "Lavender & Lace."  Inside, the air hung thick with hairspray and dreams – the scent of yesterday's rosewater shampoo lingering in the air alongside a faint undercurrent of citrusy toner.  

**Main Character:** 

Emilia Thornwood, a woman whose life was as meticulously organized as her clients' meticulously coiffed hairstyles. At thirty-five years old, she had built "Lavender & Lace" from scratch - a dream fueled by countless hours spent learning the intricate art of hairstyling and a firm belief that women deserved more than just a good haircut.  Her salon wasn’t just about styling; it was an oasis of tranquility where each client felt seen and understood.

**Setting:** 

The tiny shop in the heart of Oakhaven, a quaint town nestled within rolling hills of Kentucky, was its own character – a Victorian-era facade with faded floral wallpaper and delicate, hand-painted birds on its walls. Outside, autumn leaves began to paint the world in reds and golds, while inside, Emilia's focus remained firmly on her clients as she prepped for another day in the whirlwind of beauty.
