Rain lashed against the storefront windows of "Homestead Realty," blurring the once-vibrant floral displays on Elm Street into abstract splashes of colour. Inside, Amelia Hawthorne, her trademark auburn braids practically hidden beneath a woolen cap pulled low over her face, sighed deeply. The heavy scent of rain and old pine filled the air, as it always did in this quaint corner of Boston.  Amelia's usually optimistic heart felt heavy. Another failed showing. 

The phone rang, shattering the monotony of silence, pulling Amelia from her thoughts like a splash of cold water. It was Mrs. Davis, the elderly widow next door whose house had been on the market for longer than she cared to remember. "It's just not working, Amelia," Mrs. Davis' voice, thin and shaky on the other end of the line, broke through Amelia's self-recriminations. “The last few listings fell through faster than leaves in a fall wind.” 

Amelia took a sip from her lukewarm coffee, its bitter taste mirroring her growing unease. This wasn’t just about one house; this was about more than a sale. It was about the spirit of Homestead Realty - the very heart and soul Amelia had poured into for years, even when it seemed impossible to keep afloat in a city as unforgiving as Boston.
