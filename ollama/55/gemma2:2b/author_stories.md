The salt-laced wind whipped Amelia Hawthorne's auburn hair across her face as she stood on the rickety wooden pier overlooking the vast, churning Atlantic Ocean.  Her worn canvas bag lay open at her feet, spilling a jumbled mess of manuscript pages and crumpled coffee cups. It was here, in this desolate stretch of Maine coastline, that Amelia found solace, inspiration, or just plain old chaos. The setting sun painted the sky in hues of fiery orange and bruised purple, casting long, melancholic shadows across the crashing waves. 

Amelia wasn't sure what she was writing anymore. Her newest novel had stalled, a frustrating jumble of half-formed characters and plot threads that felt as adrift as her own thoughts. She'd poured years into crafting this story about an aging lighthouse keeper grappling with his fading memories and the unquiet ghost of his past.  But now, the words refused to flow, leaving Amelia feeling like a ship without sails, tossed helplessly on the stormy sea of creative block. 

As she pulled her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself, a lone gull screeched overhead, its cry echoing against the crashing waves. The solitude was both comforting and isolating.  Amelia knew she couldn't escape the gnawing emptiness within, not while the story refused to take shape. Tonight, though, she wouldn't wallow in self-pity. She had a fire inside, an ember of hope that needed feeding. It simply required a spark.
