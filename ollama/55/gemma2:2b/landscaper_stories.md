Rain hammered against Thomas Hawthorne's worn baseball cap as he stared at the mud-splattered canvas bag slung over his shoulder. He shifted from foot to foot, frustration bubbling beneath his usual cheerful demeanor.  For twenty years in this town, he’d seen seasons turn like a kaleidoscope of colors, but nothing had ever been quite so unforgiving as this summer's relentless downpour. The vibrant orange and yellow hues of the fall flowers he carefully cultivated were being swallowed by the damp earth, their petals wilting like forgotten dreams. His eyes drifted to the overflowing gutters nearby, a silent monument to the stubborn resistance of nature’s whims. 

Thomas Hawthorne wasn't just your average landscaper.  He was the guardian of this quiet suburban haven, its beating heart with every rose bush he pruned and meticulously-designed lawn he maintained. But even the sturdy oak tree he considered his own personal oracle couldn't stand against the relentless assault of the storm. 
   
The air hung heavy with the scent of wet earth and lingering wood smoke from the neighboring fireplace – a smell that usually offered solace, but tonight felt suffocating.  He tightened his grip on the bag, its contents feeling as uncooperative as the rain itself: the delicate ceramic bird figurines he’d spent hours restoring for Mrs. Peterson's annual Christmas display. 
    
Suddenly, a flash of lightning illuminated the sky, casting the world in an eerie white glow. A sharp crack echoed through the air, and Thomas felt a strange shiver run down his spine. The rain stopped.
