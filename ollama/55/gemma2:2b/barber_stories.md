## Setting: A faded grandeur in San Francisco's Richmond District

**Character:**  Elias "El" Thorne - a man whose hands have seen more than just hair. His years spent running The Razor's Edge barbershop are etched onto his face like the lines of an old leather book, each telling a story. 

The bell above the door jangled, announcing another customer into The Razor's Edge. It was a Wednesday morning in San Francisco, and El was already battling a symphony of buzzing clippers, whispers of gossip about the latest city council hearings, and the subtle scent of hairspray clinging to the air like an afterthought. His eyes, usually a warm amber under his faded brown brows, were shadowed with worry. 

**Story Opening:**

"El?" Mrs. Reyes called out from behind a curtain of mahogany-stained wood that acted as both partition and history. "You see them again, don't you? With their shiny cars and even shinier promises?" The line of her voice held the weight of generations of whispers in this place: secrets about missing daughters and forgotten dreams; echoes of love lost to the city itself. El sighed, his gaze sweeping over the worn leather seats and chipped mirrors that reflected a time when San Francisco whispered stories on the wind, not through digital screens and late-night calls. 

**End opening.**
