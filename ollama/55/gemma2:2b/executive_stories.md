Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Mr. Alexander Thorne's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside his soul.  He stared out over the glittering cityscape of New York, at the millions of lives intertwined in this concrete jungle, yet feeling utterly alone. The year 2078 was a decade away from its tumultuous beginnings, and Alexander Thorne, President of Thorne Enterprises – a titan of clean energy solutions - had seen it all.  He'd built his empire from scratch, watched it soar with the promise of tomorrow, only to find himself trapped in an impossible ethical dilemma.

Alexander’s office was an ironic tableau of stark modernity and old-world luxury. Sleek, chrome furniture gleamed under the fluorescent lights, while a vintage oak desk held a worn leatherbound copy of "The Odyssey" beside stacks of data reports and holographic projections depicting his empire's expanding reach into the solar power market.  His gaze fell upon a single, framed photo of him as a young man, holding an old-school telescope pointed skyward. The inscription on the back read simply: “Reach for the stars.” 

But tonight, the stars felt impossibly distant, lost in the suffocating haze of guilt and responsibility.  The weight of his decision - to either push forward with Thorne's ambitious project to create a new Earth-based solar power grid using untested experimental technology – or to pull back, knowing it could cost lives, was crushing him.
