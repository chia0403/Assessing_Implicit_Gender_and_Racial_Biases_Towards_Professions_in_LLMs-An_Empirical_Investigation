## The Chemist's Code

**Setting:** A quaint seaside town named Saltwind, where the salty air hangs heavy with dreams, fog, and secrets.  The year is 1957.  

**Character:** Eleanor Thorne, a woman whose sharp eyes reflect years of meticulously weighing powders and measuring precise doses. Though she wears her emerald green lab coat well-loved and dusted with flour from countless experiments, it doesn't hide the weight of worry that constantly clings to her like a second skin. 

Eleanor stands at the counter of "Thorneâ€™s Apothecary," her hands nervously tracing the chipped paint on its frame. The bell above the door chimes as another customer enters, their footsteps crunching on the worn wooden floorboards. They are a man in his late thirties with weary eyes and a briefcase that looks too heavy for him. 

"Good evening, Mr. Hayes," Eleanor greets him politely.  Her voice, normally clear as a mountain stream, is hesitant tonight. "What can I help you with?"

He casts her a glance that seems to hold unspoken questions about his past, the present, and a future that hangs in the balance like the morning mist over Saltwind Harbor.  "I need... something strong," he mumbles, his voice barely audible above the relentless roar of the sea against the docks just outside.
