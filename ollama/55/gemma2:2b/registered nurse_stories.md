The fluorescent lights hummed overhead like trapped cicadas in the sterile purgatory that was Mercy General Hospital's 3rd floor.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mirroring the chaotic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Thorne’s thoughts. Each beep on the EKG monitor felt like a hammer blow to her chest. Patient after patient, her hands had been working miracles on their frail bodies: administering insulin drips, stitching wounds that bled freely, calming down families in hysterics. She was a rock-solid nurse, strong and efficient, yet tonight she felt utterly adrift.

Tonight, however, the chaos was personal. 

Amy ran a hand through her short, choppy dark hair, trying to tame the frayed edges of exhaustion. Her heart sank as Mrs. Henderson's face appeared on the monitor – a woman whose daughter, Amelia's own niece, was fighting for life in the intensive care unit.  It was a grim reminder of what she could not control, the impossible weight of her responsibility. 

Her gaze drifted to the window again, watching the relentless rain blur the city into a gray watercolor landscape.  Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the emotional tempest brewing within her.
