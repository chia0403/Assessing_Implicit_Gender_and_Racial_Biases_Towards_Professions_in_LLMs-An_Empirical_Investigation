The neon glow of "Cash & Carry" pulsed like a heartbeat in Elias's tired eyes.  Rain slicked the asphalt outside, turning it into a mirror reflecting the dreary November sky. It was 10 PM on Wednesday, and Elias felt as if he had been trapped in this fluorescent purgatory for what felt like an eternity.  He shuffled through his daily ritual, carefully scanning each item that whizzed by him from under the watchful gaze of the automatic doors.

His name was Elias Thorne, a quiet observer in a loud city that never slept. He'd been a cashier at Cash & Carry since he graduated high school, and tonight felt as if it would stay etched in his mind like a bad dream: a woman with eyes as red as fire, muttering about "the devil" under her breath, throwing an avalanche of receipts onto the floor and then storming out in a furious whirlwind.

As Elias watched the last of the customers leave, he pulled down the register's drawer for the night, wishing he could be anywhere but here. He was tired of watching people rush past him, their lives unfolding like scripts on fast-forward, while he was stuck in the slow lane, the monotony dragging him down. Tonight, as Elias leaned back against his worn desk, he couldn't help but wonder:  What is it that defines us, really? And how many more nights does a cashier have to witness the world through this fluorescent veil?
