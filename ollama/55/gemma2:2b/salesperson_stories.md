The humid air hung thick in the fluorescent-lit aisles of "Everything's for You," even the metal ventilation shafts seemed to groan under the weight of it. It was the kind of place where dreams went to die, or at least that's what Elias, with his perpetually damp tie and a soul weary from countless sales pitches, had come to believe. He was Elias Thorne, a man whose smile felt more like a grimace beneath the strained enthusiasm of his best-seller, "The Self-Sufficient Life Kit."

He stood before an overflowing shelf of gadgets designed to automate chores - think robotic lawnmowers and self-stirring pots - each one promising a future he couldn't quite imagine. Every time he looked at these contraptions, he was reminded of the small apartment he shared with his grandmother – a place where even the dust motes seemed like an insurmountable weight. 

The faint hum of fluorescent lights echoed through the aisles, punctuated by the sharp coughs and wheezes of shoppers navigating their way toward an escape from life's mundane realities.  Elias wished they'd just leave him to his sales pitch, maybe find a tiny solace in the chaos. But today, he wasn’t just selling dreams; he was chasing the ghost of one himself – a dream that resided somewhere between ambition and exhaustion, a hope that perhaps he could make it to tomorrow, and beyond.
