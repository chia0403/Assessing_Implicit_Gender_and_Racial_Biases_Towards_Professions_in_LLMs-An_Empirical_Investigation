Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Charlie's van, a relentless percussion echoing across the deserted industrial park. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of pine resin, turpentine, and a lingering ghost of last week's spilled beer. The flickering light from his headlamp revealed intricate scaffolding in the corner, its metal frame groaning under the weight of Charlie's own tired body. 

His name was Charles "Charlie" Sterling. He was a roofer by trade, a solitary craftsman who found solace and frustration in the rhythmic clang and scrape of nails against shingles, hammering out solutions for his clients as he climbed.  Even at the peak of his life, at the age of thirty-five with a wife and two young kids to support, there was something lonely about the quiet solitude of his work, a vast emptiness that only the roar of rain could fill momentarily.  This evening though, Charlieâ€™s usual solace seemed to be failing him. 

The storm had kicked up earlier than expected, turning yesterday's pleasant summer evening into a torrent of wind and thunder. He sighed, pulling a worn plaid blanket from his toolbox - a small comfort in the unforgiving night. It was just a few more hours, he reminded himself, a few more shingles to replace before the rain eased up, and then back home for another round of the ever-present family chaos that was life with kids.
