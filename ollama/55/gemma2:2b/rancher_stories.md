Ethan, known to some as "Hawkeye" for his keen eye and even keener judgment, was running his family's cattle ranch - an aging behemoth stretching across miles of rolling plains and jagged mountains.  He rode out onto the ridge, wind whipping through his weathered beard, the chill seeping into his bones like liquid ice.
