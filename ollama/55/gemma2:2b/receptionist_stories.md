The whirring of fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like agitated bees, their pale, sterile glow illuminating Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's weary face. It was 3:02 PM on another Tuesday, and her afternoon shift at Zenith Technologies had been punctuated by the same dull symphony of keyboard clicks, phone calls with irate clients, and the ever-looming specter of a mountain of unprocessed paperwork.  

The sleek, modern offices of Zenith were an anomaly against the gritty, almost forgotten corner of town where Amy worked. The stark white walls seemed to scream "ambition" as she polished her worn name tag on the front desk - a constant reminder of the high-flying world she was meant to serve but felt increasingly distant from. She dreamt of escaping the confines of these glass-walled towers, but reality demanded she greet the next bewildered customer with a smile that could possibly mask her growing disillusionment.
