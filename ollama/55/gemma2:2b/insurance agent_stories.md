Rain lashed against the window of Arthur Blackwood's office, mimicking the erratic rhythm of his pulse.  He adjusted the collar of his worn tweed suit, the aroma of stale coffee clinging to the air like a phantom limb. Outside, the world was blurring into a kaleidoscope of grey and green, reflecting the storm brewing inside him. 

Arthur Blackwood wasn’t built for storms. He was an insurance agent, a weaver of promises and policies, the quiet man behind the seemingly mundane life insurance forms he dealt with every day.  He found solace in the spreadsheets, in the familiar faces of his clientele, and the sense of order that his meticulous routines brought. But tonight, the weight of a new case had crashed down on him like a rogue wave, leaving him adrift and unsure how to navigate its treacherous waters. 

The storm outside mirrored the turmoil within Arthur's soul: the disappearance of Mrs. Hawthorne, a widow who he’d met last week, her face etched with quiet desperation. Her insurance claim was for more than just a missing life; it was about protecting a legacy, a carefully woven tapestry she feared was unraveling.  The case felt different, larger than life itself. Arthur knew it. 
 
**Setting:** Arthur Blackwood's office is a cozy den of organized chaos. Antique grandfather clocks chime in the background while stacks of legal documents and file folders line every inch of available surface. A worn-out map of the city hangs on the wall, highlighting his usual routes for client visits, each path marked with faded ink and years of shared experiences.
