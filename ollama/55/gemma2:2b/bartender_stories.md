The rain was a steady curtain against the windowpane, each drop like a hesitant heartbeat against the glass.  Inside "Three Wishes," the usual buzz of conversation had been replaced by the lonely thrum of the old jukebox and the rhythmic clinking of glasses as Eloise, with her shoulder-length dark hair cascading down her back and emerald eyes that held more than just whiskey, polished another glass. 

Eloise was a woman born under a full moon in a storm, she'd always say, and her demeanor reflected it: a brooding intensity that belied the soft smile that occasionally touched her lips as she saw a familiar face walk into the bar.  Tonight, however, there was something different about Eloise’s usual calm demeanor. Her eyes were trained on the man who entered, his silhouette shrouded in a heavy coat against the fading light.  His presence felt like a storm brewing in the corner of the room, an unspoken question hanging between them as he approached the bar. 

Eloise's heart skipped a beat. She knew him, even if only from memory – a shadow from a past she wished to forget. His name was Caleb Westfall, and Eloise’s heart remembered him like a childhood rhyme sung in a hushed tone.
