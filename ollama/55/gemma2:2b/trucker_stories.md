Rain hammered against the cab of his rig, each drop echoing like tiny drums on the warped steel of the trailer.  Inside, Jebediah "Jeb" Hawthorne wiped away condensation from the cracked windshield with a grimy rag. The air hung heavy and damp, thick with the scent of diesel fuel and cheap motel coffee. Outside, the world was a blurry canvas of grey streaks and flashes of neon as lightning danced across the otherwise monochrome sky. 

Jeb's engine rumbled in response to the ceaseless downpour, each cycle a rhythmic counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain. This run from Memphis to Los Angeles had been brutal, punctuated by endless stretches of asphalt under skies so dreary they seemed to suck the light out of everything. The only solace came in the form of stale coffee and the occasional roadside diner where the waitress was as friendly as a dusty old truck stop barstool. 

He'd passed through Oklahoma just hours ago, his thoughts spiraling down a familiar rabbit hole of missed calls, unresolved problems, and fleeting memories of promises that had gone unkept.  Jeb sighed, pushing his worn leather cap further back on his head. This journey felt like one long farewell to everything he knew and loved â€“ or at least, what was left after the years of hardship and heartbreak. 


**Setting:** A deserted highway in the heartland of America, under a storm-ridden sky that promises both hope and despair.
