The fluorescent hum of the office lights felt like static electricity buzzing against Amelia's skull. The aroma of stale coffee mingled with the ever-present scent of ink and paper – a peculiar combination that was as familiar to her as breathing.  Her name, Amelia Rose "Amy" Thorne, was almost an afterthought now, just another entry in the endless stream of tax returns that flowed through the cavernous space she called home for three years.

Amy, with her quiet demeanor and steady hand, was a beacon of normalcy in the chaotic storm of financial lives she helped navigate.  She’d learned to read the language of tax forms as though it were an ancient scroll - understanding the unspoken hopes, fears, and anxieties hidden within each individual's messy paperwork. 

Today, however, something felt different. A wave of unease washed over Amy as she watched a young man in his early twenties pace back and forth, clutching a worn-out briefcase like a lifeline. His eyes darted nervously around the room before finally landing on her desk with an unmistakable desperation.  His story was about to begin.
