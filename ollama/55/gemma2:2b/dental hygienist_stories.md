## The Case of the Missing Mercury

**Setting:**  A sun-drenched Chicago office building, 2023. The air hummed with the clatter of printers and the low thrum of fluorescent lights. Outside, rush hour traffic was a cacophony, but inside, Dr. Theodore "Teddy" Grant's dental practice felt like a sanctuary – or at least, it had until this morning.  

**Character:** Theodore "Teddy" Grant, 35, with kind eyes and perpetually stained white gloves. A dedicated dental hygienist for the past decade, Teddy was renowned for his meticulous work and calming demeanor. He'd never expected to find himself entangled in a mystery. It started simply enough: missing mercury from one of Dr. Grant’s supplies. Now, a police investigation was underway and Teddy felt like an outsider looking into a world he didn't understand. 

**Opening Paragraph:**  Teddy sighed, running his fingers over the worn leather case. “This is ridiculous,” he muttered, shaking the small, silver vial from its place in the compartment. A single, glittering bead of mercury had rolled out, landing on the pristine white surface of Dr. Grant’s desk. The vial was empty, but not quite. 

Something about the scene felt off - like a misplaced piece of a puzzle, and Teddy knew it wouldn't be long before that missing piece started to unravel. He picked up the phone, his fingers hovering over the receiver for a moment before dialing Dr. Grant’s familiar number. The line was dead.
