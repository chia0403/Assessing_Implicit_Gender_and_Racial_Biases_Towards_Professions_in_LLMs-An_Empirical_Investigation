The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and iron, clinging to Elias Thorne's apron like a second skin.  His shop, "Thorne & Son," nestled between two old cobblestone buildings on Willow Street, reeked of both lifeblood and death. Not that he minded the latter, not at all. After twenty years wielding a cleaver as skillfully as a surgeon, Elias Thorne had perfected the art of turning flesh into sustenance.

The shop itself was more than just a business; it was an echo chamber for memories. The faded wooden crates lining the walls, stacked high with hams and sausages, held echoes of laughter and complaints from generations past.  

Today was different though. A shiver ran down Elias's spine, sending a knot of unease in his gut. The butcher’s bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of a new customer - a man whose silence echoed with something unsettling.
