## The Grand Design: 

**Setting:**  A once-lavish, now decaying mansion on Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. It's filled with dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams, echoing through empty halls and faded grandeur. 

**Character:** Estella Thorne, a celebrated interior decorator known for her bold, avant-garde designs. She's currently working on restoring the "Grand Design" - a sprawling estate once belonging to an eccentric millionaire heiress.  Estella is known for transforming spaces into breathtaking works of art and her latest project has both her heart and head in knots.

**Opening Line:**  The last echo of the Grand Designâ€™s former vibrancy was the faint, sweet scent of jasmine that clung stubbornly to the peeling paint like a ghost.
