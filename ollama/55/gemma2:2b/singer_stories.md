The smoky air hung thick with anticipation as Aurelia "Aure" Blackwood took center stage.  A single spotlight illuminated her from beneath a cascade of auburn hair cascading down her back. The roar of the crowd was deafening, yet it wasn't the music itself that stirred Aure’s soul. It was the image reflected back at her in the mirrored panel behind the microphone stand: a face young and bright, but with eyes hardened by years spent fighting for every note and every dream. 

Aure lived in a world of soaring melodies and raw emotion – but tonight, her song wasn't just about the music. It was about survival. This city, this stage, this moment—they were all testaments to her resilience. She had grown up on the streets, singing for scraps and battling apathy as her only audience. Now, years later, she stood before a thousand faces, each one a potential lifeline in the storm that was her life. The city lights glittered off her silver pendant - a gift from her grandmother, inscribed with a single word: "Believe."
