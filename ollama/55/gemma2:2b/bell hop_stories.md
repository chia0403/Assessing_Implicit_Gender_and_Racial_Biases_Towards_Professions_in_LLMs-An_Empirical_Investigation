The humid air hung thick and heavy over the Grand Majestic Hotel, clinging to Elara Delacroix like a damp shroud. She surveyed her small world – the plush velvet carpets of room 317, the echoing grandeur of the lobby, the polished mahogany desk where Mr. Fitzwilliam ran his business affairs - all dwarfed by the oppressive weight of the summer storm raging outside. The rain pounded against the windows, a relentless rhythm against which Elara's own heartbeat beat a frantic counter-melody. 

At twenty-two, Elara was young for a bell hop in this city; she had the restless energy of a whirlwind, constantly searching for a story to write in her worn leather notebook. This job, serving as one of the many faces that smiled upon the Grand Majestic's endless guests – an ephemeral existence within the vast labyrinth of the hotel - offered her anonymity and the thrill of fleeting encounters. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A strange energy pulsed under the surface of the usual chaos; a low hum of anticipation that Elara couldn't quite decipher. The air crackled with unspoken tension as she waited for Mr. Fitzwilliam to return from his routine tour of guest floors.  The old man was notoriously meticulous about his daily routines, yet tonight he seemed almost... agitated. 


His arrival brought an urgency that made Elara shift uneasily. His eyes were focused, and his movements, normally smooth and measured, lacked their usual grace. "Elara," he began, voice low and urgent, "I need you."
