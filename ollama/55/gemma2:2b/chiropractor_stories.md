## The Crack in the Colosseum

**Setting:**  The year is 1943, a sweltering summer in Rome. The air hums with tension as Allied forces fight for their freedom against the Axis in the heart of World War II. While bombs fall on the distant battleships and tanks rumble through the cobblestone streets, Dr. Alessandro "Allie" De Angelis tries to find some semblance of peace amongst his patients at his clinic on a quiet corner of Via Giulia. 

**Opening:** Allie's hands hovered over the spine of Mrs. Esposito, her weathered face etched with years of worry and pain. She clutched a worn rosary, beads whispering in a language only time could understand. Her grandson, Marco, was supposed to leave for France soon, but every morning, he came with his grandmother's back screaming in protest. "You just need to find that spark, Allie," Mrs. Esposito whispered, her voice hoarse from years of shouting in the crowded cafes.  

"But Mrs. Esposito..." Allie began, feeling a familiar weight on his chest, the heavy burden of responsibility and the ever-present fear of failure. He was only a chiropractor after all, a mere human trying to navigate this chaos while holding onto what little comfort he could find in his work.

And then came the silence. A silence so profound it felt like a physical blow. Mrs. Esposito had gone still. Her eyes were wide with an unyielding fear that Allie had never seen before, and in that moment, Allie knew there was something far beyond the cracked spine of a weary woman.
