Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia "Amy" Thorne's apartment, mirroring the tumultuous thoughts churning inside her. The city lights painted streaks across the waterlogged street below, their brilliance swallowed by the thick, grey curtain of rain. She stared at the crumpled newspaper clipping on her desk, a half-eaten sandwich next to it, and sighed. It was another dead end. 

The investigation had hit a brick wall. For weeks, Amy had been piecing together the disturbing details of the disappearance of  Professor Evelyn Ashworth - a renowned astrophysicist known for her groundbreaking work on black holes.  Amy's small-town paper, The Beacon, had always been relegated to the periphery, dealing with local issues like petty council meetings and dog thefts. But when Professor Ashworth vanished without a trace, leaving behind only an empty lab and a cryptic note mentioning "the echoes of infinity", Amy knew she couldn't ignore it. 

She was a journalist on a mission to bring the truth to light, even if that meant diving into the depths of a mystery as vast and incomprehensible as black holes themselves. The clock ticked, each second echoing the urgency of her situation.  The answer lay somewhere in this city's underbelly, shrouded in secrets and fueled by unanswered questions.
