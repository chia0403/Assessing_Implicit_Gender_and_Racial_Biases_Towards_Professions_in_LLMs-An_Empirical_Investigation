The grit under his worn boots clung to Theodore “Teddy” Jackson like the dust on his goggles.  It was another stifling summer morning in Phoenix, Arizona, the air thick enough to cut with a blade and hot enough to melt asphalt itself. Teddy was hunched over the controls of his behemoth, a 30-ton Cat bulldozer named "Doris." The engine thrummed like an angry beehive behind him, vibrating the metal chassis beneath his hands, and Teddy let out a weary sigh. He'd been on this dusty, sunbaked site for hours, clearing the remnants of last week's storm that had ripped through the desert, leaving trails of destruction in its wake. 

The setting: a sprawling construction site just outside of Phoenix where they were building a colossal new community center.  It wasn’t exactly paradise—more like a crucible of concrete and steel, sweat and dust, noise and grime. But for Teddy, it was his world. A place where he felt like the king of this terrain, wielding Doris like a warrior's sword, moving mountains with his mighty machine. 

He wasn't always sure why he gravitated to these heavy-duty jobs. Maybe it was the way he could feel the power coursing through him as he drove her across the landscape, leaving trails of change in his wake. Or maybe it was just a comfort, a familiar rhythm, the steady pulse of the machine matching the steady beat of his own heart.  
 
Whatever the reason, Teddy knew this was where he belonged—in the realm of heavy machinery and unrelenting sun, wielding an iron will and Doris as his ally against the unforgiving desert landscape.
