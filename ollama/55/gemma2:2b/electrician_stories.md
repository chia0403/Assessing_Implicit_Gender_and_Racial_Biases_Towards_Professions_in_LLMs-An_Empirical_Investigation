The air hung thick with the smell of damp earth and ozone, a familiar comfort for a man whose life was built around electricity. Outside, the tiny town of Harmony Creek clung to the edge of the storm-ravaged mountain range like a stubborn sapling on a windswept hillside. A dozen flickering streetlights painted streaks of orange across the rain-slicked pavement as Sparky checked his tools one last time.

This small town held secrets whispered by the wind through the aging trees - mysteries woven into the very fabric of its existence. The old man had believed they lay buried deep within the storm-battered history of Harmony Creek; he'd entrusted Sparky with finding them, and today, with his tools in hand and a surge of determination coursing through his veins, he was ready to begin.
