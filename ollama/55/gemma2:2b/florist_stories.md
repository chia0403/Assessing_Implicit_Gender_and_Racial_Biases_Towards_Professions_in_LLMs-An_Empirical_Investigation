The morning mist clung to Willow Creek like a lover's embrace, obscuring the sunrise in swirling gray. Inside "Bloom & Branch", Amelia Hawthorne, her floral-patterned apron dusted with petals, surveyed her shop.  Morning calls for vibrant hues and fresh beginnings – a theme she'd taken quite literally today. A local festival was happening that day, and Amelia had a whole week’s worth of custom orders to tackle.

The air inside the shop buzzed with life. The faint scent of lilies and roses mingled with the earthy aroma of cut grass from last night’s deliveries. It was a scene she'd grown accustomed to, year after year, yet it never failed to fill her with a peculiar warmth. 

As Amelia started setting up bouquets for the "Flower Power" theme they were going for, she noticed something out of place. A single crimson rose, its petals perfectly formed, lay on her workbench, untouched. Its stem was askew, and a faint scent of citrus hung around it. It felt like a secret waiting to be unveiled.  Amelia's heart skipped a beat. This wasn’t just any rose, not even one from her supplier's new collection.
