Here's a story opening:

Detective Emily Alexandra Thompson stepped out of her car and onto the cracked asphalt of Main Street, the small town's central hub. The sun was setting over the quaint shops and diners, casting a warm orange glow over the scene before her. A sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach as she gazed up at the old Victorian house that stood like a sentinel on the hill above town.

It was 8:45 PM on a chilly autumn evening, and the streets were quiet, save for the distant hum of a lone police cruiser patrolling the outskirts of town. Emily had been called to the scene just after 9:00 PM, responding to a 911 call from the house's occupant, 75-year-old Henry Lee. The dispatcher had reported a possible homicide, and Emily's gut was already racing with worst-case scenarios.

As she took in her surroundings, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that this case would be different from all the others she'd worked on before. There was something about Henry Lee's phone call that seemed...off. He had been frantic, his voice trembling as he reported a scream for help coming from inside the house. But when Emily arrived, she found no signs of forced entry or struggle. The front door was open, and the interior lights were still on.

"What do I find?" Emily muttered to herself, her eyes scanning the darkening landscape. She took a deep breath, shouldering her backpack and grabbing her notebook and pen. It was time to get to work.
