As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the small town of Willow Creek, Oregon, 32-year-old Caleb Jenson stepped out of his worn wooden shop, the scent of freshly cut cedar and sawdust lingering in the evening air. The soft glow of string lights strung along the town's main street cast a warm ambiance over the quaint streets, where the sounds of children's laughter and the distant rumble of the Willamette River created a soothing melody.

Caleb, with his rugged hands and weathered face, was a carpenter through and through. He had spent years honing his craft under the guidance of his father, who had taught him everything from framing to finish work. Over the years, Caleb's reputation as one of Willow Creek's finest craftsmen had grown, and his shop, "Jenson's Woodworks," had become a staple in the community.

Tonight, however, was different. Tonight, Caleb felt a sense of unease settle in the pit of his stomach, like a small crack in a well-made wall. It started with a mysterious phone call earlier that day from an unknown number, its voice low and menacing, whispering a single phrase: "You're not who you think you are." The words had sent a shiver down Caleb's spine, leaving him wondering if it was just the product of a tired mind or something more sinister.
