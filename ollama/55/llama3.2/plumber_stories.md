Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the small town of Willow Creek like a relentless curse, drumming against the pavement and overflowing the storm drains that had been clogged by years of neglect. It was a smell that Evan Thompson knew all too well - the acrid tang of stagnant water and decay.

As a plumber, Evan had seen it all - from burst pipes to backed-up septic systems, he'd fixed them all in his years of serving the tight-knit community. But tonight felt different. Tonight, something felt off.

Evan stood outside the local hardware store, the neon sign flickering like a heartbeat above the parking lot. The owner, Joe, had called him at midnight with a plea for help - the town's water main was threatening to burst, and Joe didn't know how much longer he could keep it from happening.

The streets were empty and dimly lit, save for the solitary streetlamp that cast long shadows across the wet pavement. Evan pulled his truck into the alley behind the hardware store, the wheels squeaking as they hit the oil-soaked ground. He was about to get out when a gust of wind whipped through the alley, sending trash flying and rattling loose cans.

"What's going on, Joe?" Evan called out over the din, his voice carrying above the howling wind.

Joe emerged from the store, a worried look etched across his face. "Evan, I don't know what to do," he said, his words lost in the storm. "The main is failing. We need it fixed tonight."

Evan nodded grimly and headed into the alley, already mentally preparing himself for the long night ahead.
