Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

It was a drizzly Wednesday evening in late spring, and the grandeur of the Golden Sunset Hotel's lobby seemed to fade into the shadows as the rain pattered against the glass doors. Amidst the faded opulence, 25-year-old Elijah Thomas Winters moved with purpose, his bright blue uniform a stark contrast to the dullness of the evening. A bell hop at one of Manhattan's most storied hotels, Elijah had seen it all - from VIPs' tantrums to lost luggage, and everything in between.

As he navigated the lobby on his way to collect a jacket left by a departing guest, Elijah's gaze drifted out into the rain-soaked streets. The neon lights of Times Square twinkled like fireflies in the distance, a beacon of excitement that seemed worlds away from the musty, old-world charm of the hotel. Elijah had grown up just outside of Harlem, surrounded by the vibrant sounds and smells of the city, but as he made his way through the winding corridors of the Golden Sunset, he couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to life than serving drinks and collecting coats.

And yet, for now, Elijah's fate was tied to this venerable hotel, where generations of travelers had come and gone, each leaving behind their own stories and secrets. Little did he know, tonight would be no ordinary night - one that would change everything.
