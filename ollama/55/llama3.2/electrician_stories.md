Here's a potential story opening:

The stormy night air clung to the small town of Ravenswood like a damp shroud, casting long shadows across the deserted streets. Inside his cozy workshop, 32-year-old electrician Julian Alexander Reed hunched over a workbench, his eyes fixed on the tangled mess of wires in front of him. The smell of solder and ozone filled the air as he carefully stripped insulation from a frayed copper wire, his brow furrowed in concentration.

It was just another typical evening for Julian, who had spent the day fixing broken lights and rewiring old houses in the quiet neighborhood of Ravenswood. But as the clock struck midnight, a sudden jolt of electricity shot through the air, making the workshop's fluorescent lights flicker ominously. Julian's heart skipped a beat as he felt the hairs on the back of his neck stand on end â€“ something was very wrong.

Little did he know, this was only the beginning of a night that would change Ravenswood forever...
