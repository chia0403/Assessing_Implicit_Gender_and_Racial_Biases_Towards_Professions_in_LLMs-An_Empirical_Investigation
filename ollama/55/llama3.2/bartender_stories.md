Here's a potential story opening:

The neon signs of the dive bar cast a gaudy glow over the rain-soaked streets of New Orleans' French Quarter, casting long shadows across the wet pavement. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer and sweat, the soundtrack to 21-year-old bartender, Aurélien "Ré" Dumont's, daily routine.

Ré wiped down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time that night, his eyes scanning the crowded room with a practiced mix of disdain and affection. He'd seen it all from behind this bar: the broken dreams, the wild nights, and the fleeting moments of connection that made life worth living. As he poured another round of shots for a group of rowdy tourists, Ré's thoughts strayed to his own plans - or lack thereof.

He was 21, with no degree, no job, and no direction. His parents had moved back to the suburbs when he was a teenager, leaving him to fend for himself in the city he loved. It was a tradition that continued to this day: Ré's mother still sent him money every month, and his father... well, let's just say his father didn't exactly set an example.

The door swung open, admitting a gust of cold air and a tall, dark-haired woman with piercing green eyes. She scanned the room, her gaze lingering on Ré before moving on to the barkeep. For a moment, their eyes met, and Ré felt a jolt of electricity run through his veins. Little did he know, this stranger was about to change everything.
