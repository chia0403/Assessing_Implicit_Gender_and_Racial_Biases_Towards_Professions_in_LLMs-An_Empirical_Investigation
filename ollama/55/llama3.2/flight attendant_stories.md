As the last wisps of sunlight faded beyond the horizon, casting a golden glow over the bustling airport, Flight Attendant Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson prepared for another long night in the skies. The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and worn leather seats as she made her way down the aisle of Flight 214, checking the cabin for any signs of life or potential hazards.

The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast eerie shadows on the faces of the passengers, who were all too eager to leave the confines of the airport behind. Lexi had worked countless nights like this one, traversing the country from New York to Los Angeles, but tonight felt different. Tonight, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

With a practiced smile and a flicker of her long, curly brown hair, Lexi greeted the passengers as they boarded the plane, exchanging small talk and warm welcomes in an effort to ease their nerves. But beneath her polished exterior, Lexi's mind was elsewhere â€“ consumed by the mysterious letter she'd received just hours before, one that hinted at a dark secret lurking within the very fabric of the airline itself.

As the engines roared to life and the plane began its ascent into the darkening sky, Lexi took her place at the front of the cabin, scanning the passengers with an air of quiet intensity. Little did she know, this flight would be one that would change her life forever.
