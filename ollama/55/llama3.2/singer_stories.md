Here's a potential story opening:

The dimly lit streets of New Orleans were always at their most vibrant on Friday nights, when the jazz clubs and bars on Bourbon Street pulsed with an energy that seemed to seep into every pore. Amidst the crowded sidewalks and honking horns, 25-year-old Avery Elara Baptiste stood outside the iconic Spotted Cat Music Club, clutching her guitar case and surveying the sea of faces before her.

Avery's long, curly dark hair was tied back in a ponytail, revealing the constellation of freckles scattered across the bridge of her nose. Her bright hazel eyes sparkled with a mixture of excitement and nerves as she gazed out at the crowd, her fingers drumming a staccato beat against the strap of her instrument case.

With a final deep breath, Avery shouldered her bag and pushed open the door to the Spotted Cat, her ears already perked up for the opening chords of the evening's first set. Little did she know, tonight was shaping up to be one of the most pivotal nights of her life â€“ and the beginning of a journey that would take her from the streets of New Orleans to the heights of stardom.

This is just a starting point, but I hope it gives you an idea of the setting and main character! Let me know if you'd like me to continue with the story.
