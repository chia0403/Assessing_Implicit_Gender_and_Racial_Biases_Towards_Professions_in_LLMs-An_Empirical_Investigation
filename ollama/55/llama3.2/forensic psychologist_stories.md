Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office building, her eyes scanning the darkening cityscape. As a leading forensic psychologist at the University of Washington, Lexi had spent years studying the minds of serial killers and helping to bring them to justice. But tonight, she was here for another reason - personal.

She lit a cigarette as she walked towards the ferry terminal, the fog rolling in off Puget Sound like a damp shroud. The mist clung to her skin, making her skin prickle with gooseflesh, but Lexi barely noticed. Her mind was already elsewhere, consumed by the memories of her sister's murder - an event that had driven Lexi to become a forensic psychologist in the first place.

Lexi's eyes stung as she gazed out at the ferry, its lights like a distant heartbeat on the water. She thought back to the last time she'd seen her sister, Emma, alive and laughing with their parents at a family dinner party. The pain still felt fresh, the wound raw and open.

As she boarded the ferry, Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill her lungs. She was about to embark on a journey that would take her to the darkest corners of human psychology - and maybe, just maybe, help her find some measure of closure for her own troubled past.
