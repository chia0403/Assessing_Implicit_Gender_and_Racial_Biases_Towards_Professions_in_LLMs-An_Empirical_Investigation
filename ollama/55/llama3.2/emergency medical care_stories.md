**Setting:** The small coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, nestled between rugged cliffs and rocky shores, was bathed in a warm golden light as the sun began to set on another long day. The air was alive with the sound of seagulls crying overhead and the faint scent of saltwater carried on the breeze.

**Main Character:** Aurora "Rory" Blackwood, a 25-year-old Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) with a sharp mind and a quick wit, stood outside the Ravenswood General Hospital's helipad, her eyes fixed intently on the horizon as she sipped a lukewarm coffee from a battered thermos.

Tonight was supposed to be a quiet night, with only a few minor scrapes and bruises to attend to. But as she scanned the horizon, her trained instincts began to pick up on something – a faint flutter in the distance, a hint of chaos that didn't feel like just another ordinary night in Ravenswood...
