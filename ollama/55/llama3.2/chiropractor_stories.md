Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Alex" Thompson adjusted her glasses as she gazed out the large window of her office, watching the sun rise over the small town of Willow Creek. The gentle mist that clung to the streets below seemed to whisper secrets to the sleepy residents, who were just starting to stir from their cozy beds.

As a chiropractor and owner of Thompson Chiropractic, Alex had spent years building a reputation for herself as one of the most compassionate and skilled practitioners in town. Her office, nestled on Main Street, was a haven for those seeking relief from back pain, neck tension, and other musculoskeletal ailments. The soothing sounds of jazz music and the soft hum of gentle stretching exercises filled the air, creating an atmosphere that was both calming and rejuvenating.

But despite her success in Willow Creek, Alex couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. A sense of restlessness had been growing inside her for weeks, like a tickle at the base of her spine. She had tried to brush it off as mere exhaustion, but deep down, she knew that there was more to it.

As she took a moment to collect her thoughts, Alex's eyes wandered to a small note on her desk, scribbled in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at the old oak tree tonight. -J." Who was J, and what did they want with her? The question lingered in the air like an unspoken challenge, as Alex prepared to face whatever lay ahead.

The sun continued its ascent, casting a warm glow over Willow Creek, but for Alex, the day had already begun with a sense of foreboding.
