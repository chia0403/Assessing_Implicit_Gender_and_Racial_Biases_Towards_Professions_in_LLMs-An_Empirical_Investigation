Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Red Oak, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and weathered buildings. In a worn denim shirt and faded jeans, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins trudged through the dirt and debris of the construction site, his boots scuffling against the gravel.

As one of the lead workers on the project, Hawk had spent countless hours overseeing the transformation of the old, abandoned mill into a trendy new boutique hotel. The smell of freshly poured concrete and the hum of power tools filled the air, a constant reminder that this town was finally starting to come alive again.

Hawk's eyes narrowed as he surveyed the site, his mind already turning to the problems he'd need to tackle in the morning. A few days ago, a sudden downpour had flooded the construction yard, threatening to ruin weeks of hard work. The team had scrambled to clean up and salvage what they could, but Hawk couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

As he reached the edge of the site, Hawk spotted his coworker, Maria, huddled over a stack of blueprints, her brow furrowed in concentration. "Hey, Mags," he called out, clapping her on the shoulder. "What's got you so hooked up?"

Maria looked up, her dark eyes flashing with intensity. "I think I've found something, Hawk. Something big."

Hawk's curiosity was piqued. What could Maria have discovered? He leaned in closer, his voice low as he asked, "What is it?"
