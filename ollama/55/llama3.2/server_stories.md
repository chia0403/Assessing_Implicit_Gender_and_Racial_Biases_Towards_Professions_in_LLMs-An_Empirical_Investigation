Here's a potential story opening:

The neon lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement as Emily Mayfield trudged through the rain-soaked streets, her bright yellow apron a stark contrast to the drizzly gloom outside. She had just finished her shift at Bistro Bliss, a trendy restaurant in the heart of downtown that catered to the city's elite, and was looking forward to unwinding with a cold beer and a good book.

As she walked, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The restaurant had been quiet all night, and the only customer besides her boss, Marcel, had been a solitary businessman who'd ordered a solo plate of pasta and left without so much as a smile. It was as if he'd been waiting for someone - or something.

Emily pushed open the door to her apartment building, a nondescript high-rise in the financial district, and began to make her way up to the third floor. She had just changed into sweatpants and a faded t-shirt when her phone buzzed with an incoming text from Marcel. "Meet me at the restaurant at 10am tomorrow," it read.

Emily's heart skipped a beat as she wondered what could possibly require her attention after a quiet night like last night. Little did she know, her ordinary life was about to take an extraordinary turn.
