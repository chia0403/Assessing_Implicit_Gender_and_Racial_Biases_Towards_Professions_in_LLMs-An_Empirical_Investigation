Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the bustling city of New Orleans, casting a warm orange glow over the French Quarter, Aurora "Rory" LaFleur gazed out the window of her office, lost in thought. With her blonde hair tied back in a neat ponytail and a smudge of mascara on her left cheek from a long day of negotiating deals, Rory was a force to be reckoned with in the real estate world. She had spent years building her reputation as one of the top agents in the city, known for her sharp instincts and razor-sharp wit.

Rory's office, tucked away on a quiet street just a block from Bourbon Street, was a cozy sanctuary filled with the scent of fresh coffee and the hum of lively conversation. But as she stood at the window, Rory's mind was elsewhere - on the small, rundown bungalow that had been on her mind for weeks.

The 1920s gem had caught her eye at an open house just last weekend, and despite its quirky charm, Rory couldn't shake the feeling that it held secrets. The previous owner, a reclusive elderly woman named Madame Dupre, had left behind a mysterious key hidden in the kitchen sink, along with a cryptic note that read: "For the one who sees beyond the walls."

Rory's curiosity was piqued. She had always been drawn to the unknown, and this house seemed like it might just be the puzzle she'd been searching for. With a deep breath, she set her mind on making an offer - but little did she know that this house would change her life forever.
