Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, casting a golden glow over the dusty terrain as Kaitlyn "Kae" Thompson made her way back to her trusty Caterpillar 821F excavator, affectionately nicknamed "Bertha." A heavy equipment operator with years of experience under her belt, Kae had spent the day working on the construction site for the new highway that would soon connect Phoenix to Tucson. The rhythmic rumble of Bertha's engine and the smell of gasoline and diesel fuel filled the air as Kae climbed into the cab, her calloused hands settling onto the worn leather seat.

As she pulled up to the parking area, Kae noticed a sleek black SUV pulling into the lot, its tinted windows reflecting the fading light. A figure emerged from the vehicle, dressed in a crisp white shirt and khaki pants, with a hint of an air of confidence that made Kae's gut tighten ever so slightly. The stranger's eyes locked onto hers, and for a moment, they just stared at each other, the only sound being the distant hum of Bertha's engine.

Kae's instincts told her to be wary, but something about the stranger's gaze - a mix of curiosity and determination that seemed almost... familiar - made her pause. Who was this guy, and what did he want with her and Bertha? As the stranger approached, Kae couldn't help but wonder if she was about to get pulled into a job that would shake things up in more ways than one.

(Note: I've given Kaitlyn "Kae" Thompson as a heavy equipment operator. Feel free to modify or change this as per your requirements.)
