Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the San Francisco Bay, shrouding the streets of Alamo Square in a damp, gray mist. It was a chilly autumn evening, the kind that made you want to curl up with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the world outside. But for Jack "Jax" Thompson, plumber extraordinaire, there was no escape from the pipes that seemed to plague every household on the square.

As he trudged through the misty streets, his worn toolbox slung over his shoulder, Jax couldn't help but feel like he was stuck in a never-ending cycle of clogged drains and leaky faucets. He'd been a plumber for nigh on 20 years, and it seemed like no matter how many pipes he fixed, there were always more to replace.

Jax's phone buzzed with an incoming text from his best friend, Mike, the owner of the local hardware store. "Hey, man, I got a job at the big new high-rise downtown. Thought you might be interested in coming on over and checking out some pipes."

Jax groaned inwardly as he contemplated the prospect of working late into the night to fix whatever pipes were causing trouble at Mike's latest client. But something about the text had piqued his interest, and he found himself making a mental note to swing by the hardware store and see what Mike needed.

As he turned onto Laguna Street, Jax noticed a strange glow emanating from the alleyway beside the square. The light was flickering and seemed out of place among the dark, cramped spaces between the buildings. A shiver ran down his spine as he wondered what could be causing such an unusual phenomenon in this usually quiet corner of the city.

Little did Jax know, this mysterious glow would set him on a course that would take him into the very heart of San Francisco's hidden underbelly â€“ and lead him to uncover secrets that had been hidden for decades.
