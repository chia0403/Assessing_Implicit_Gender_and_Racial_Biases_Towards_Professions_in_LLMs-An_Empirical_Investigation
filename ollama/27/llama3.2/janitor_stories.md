Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast a pale glow over the worn linoleum floor of St. Michael's Catholic Church, where Emilio "Milo" Morales had spent countless hours pushing a rusty broom and sweeping up crumbs from the Sunday morning gatherings. It was a small, unassuming job, but one that gave Milo a sense of order in his chaotic life.

As he pushed his cart through the empty pews, the silence was a welcome respite from the constant chatter and laughter that filled the sanctuary on Sundays. The air was heavy with the scent of old wood and stale incense, a familiar aroma that brought a pang of nostalgia to Milo's chest. He had been working at St. Michael's for over five years, ever since he'd lost his job at the local factory and needed a steady paycheck.

Milo's eyes wandered to the stained glass windows, their colors muted by the grime that coated the panes. The church was a work in progress, just like him. He had grown up in this neighborhood, attending Mass as a kid with his abuela and now felt a strange sense of ownership over this place. Maybe it was the late-night vigils or the whispered prayers from the confessional booth, but something about St. Michael's made Milo feel seen.

As he reached the back of the church, the bell tower creaked to life, its mournful chime echoing through the deserted halls. Milo felt a shiver run down his spine; tonight was different, he could sense it. Tonight, something would change.
