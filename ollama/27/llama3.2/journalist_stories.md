Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished steel as Kaida Maeve Blackwood stepped out of her small apartment and into the grey morning air. She took a deep breath, feeling the chill of the Pacific Northwest settle into her lungs, and gazed out at the city she knew like the back of her hand.

As a journalist for the Seattle Daily News, Kaida had seen it all - from the bright lights of Pike Place Market to the dark alleys of Capitol Hill. But today, something felt off. Maybe it was the eerie silence that seemed to hang over the city like a shroud, or maybe it was the sense of unease that had been growing in her stomach since she'd received that cryptic phone call the night before.

Whatever it was, Kaida knew she had to get to work. She headed out into the rain, her eyes scanning the crowded sidewalks as she made her way to the newsroom. The Daily News was a small but scrappy operation, and Kaida was its top reporter - known for her tenacity and her knack for sniffing out stories that others missed.

As she pushed open the door to the newsroom, a warm burst of fluorescent light enveloped her, and the hum of computer keyboards filled the air. Kaida smiled wryly to herself as she spotted her editor, Mark Thompson, already sipping coffee at his desk. "Morning, kid," he said, without looking up. "We've got a developing story out of the waterfront district. Looks like something's gone down."

Kaida's ears perked up - this could be the break she needed to make a name for herself in the competitive world of Seattle journalism. She dropped her bag on the floor and slid into the empty chair beside Mark, her mind already racing with possibilities.

But as she began to scan the breaking news wires, one word kept popping up: "Missing."
