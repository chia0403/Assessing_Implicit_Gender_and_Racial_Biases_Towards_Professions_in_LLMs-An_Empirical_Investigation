The misty dawn crept over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, shrouding its quaint streets and weathered buildings in a damp, gray veil.

A master carpenter with hands that had shaped countless wooden wonders, Asher was already up and about, the scent of freshly cut wood and coffee fueling his morning routine.
