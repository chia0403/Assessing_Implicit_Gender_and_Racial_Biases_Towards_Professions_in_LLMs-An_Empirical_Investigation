Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment in the coastal town of Crescent Bay, breathing in the salty air as she gazed out at the ocean. The sun was just starting to rise over the waves, casting a warm golden light over the bustling pier where Lexi's clients were already gathered for their morning sessions. As an occupational therapist with a specialty in sensory integration and adaptive equipment, Lexi had spent years building a reputation as one of the most innovative and compassionate therapists on the West Coast.

The sound of seagulls filled the air as Lexi made her way down to the pier, her bright pink hair tied back in a ponytail behind her. She was just about to start her first session of the day when she noticed a young woman sitting by herself at the edge of the pier, staring out at the water with a look of quiet desperation on her face.

Lexi's eyes narrowed as she made her way over to the stranger, wondering what had brought this new client to Crescent Bay. She slid into the chair beside the woman and introduced herself, trying to put the stranger at ease. "Hi there," Lexi said gently. "I'm Dr. Thompson, your occupational therapist for today's session. Can I get you started with a cup of coffee or something?"
