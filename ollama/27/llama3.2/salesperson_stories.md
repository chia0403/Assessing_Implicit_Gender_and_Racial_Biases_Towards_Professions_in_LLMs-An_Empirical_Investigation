Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the bustling streets of Tokyo's Shinjuku district, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and neon-lit billboards that lined the sidewalks. Amidst the hustle and bustle, 28-year-old Kenji Nakahara stood outside his small office building, sipping on a cup of steaming hot coffee as he gazed out at the crowded streets.

As a top salesperson for the Japanese division of a multinational electronics company, Kenji was used to being in high demand. He had built a reputation for himself as a shrewd and charismatic negotiator, able to talk his way into securing lucrative deals with even the toughest clients. But despite his success on the job, Kenji couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing. He felt restless, like there was more to life than the endless cycle of sales calls and high-pressure negotiations.

As he checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time that evening, a sudden burst of rain swept through the streets, sending pedestrians scrambling for cover. Kenji watched wistfully as the raindrops danced on the pavement, feeling a pang of longing for something more - anything more - than the monotony of his sales routine.

Little did he know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would take him to the farthest reaches of Japan and back again, forcing him to confront his own demons and question everything he thought he knew about himself.
