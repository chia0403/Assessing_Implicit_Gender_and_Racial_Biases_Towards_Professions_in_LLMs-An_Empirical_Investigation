Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven City were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this, when the storm clouds hung low over the skyscrapers like an iron fist. In the heart of the city, where the darkness seemed to swallow everything whole, Kaidën Rylan stood watch as a guard at the imposing New Haven Towers.

Kaidën's eyes scanned the wet pavement, his gaze lingering on the shadows that danced across the buildings like living things. A veteran of the tower's security team, he had seen it all - from street fights to gangland shootouts - and yet, tonight felt different. Tonight, the air seemed heavy with an undercurrent of menace, as if something was waiting just out of sight, watching and waiting.

As a guard at the New Haven Towers, Kaidën took pride in his work. He had been trained to respond to even the smallest disturbance, and he knew every inch of the tower's labyrinthine corridors and security systems by heart. But tonight, as he stood vigilant on the 23rd floor, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The phone on his comms wrist flickered to life, shrill in the silence. "Night watch," a voice crackled through the speaker, "you have an incoming transmission."

Kaidën's hand instinctively went to his gun, his heart rate ticking up a notch as he replied, "This is Night Watch. Who's this?"

A pause, then a low, gravelly voice spoke up, sending a shiver down Kaidën's spine: "It's a message from the outside. And it can't wait any longer."
