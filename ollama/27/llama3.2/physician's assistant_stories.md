Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Ava Elizabeth Thompson stepped out of her small apartment in the rain-soaked streets of Seattle, the grey sky mirroring the melancholy that had been weighing on her since she'd returned to her hometown three months prior. As a physician's assistant specializing in primary care, she'd spent years honing her skills in the bustling city, but after a painful divorce and a grueling stint in the ER during a pandemic, Ava found herself back in the small town of Oakdale, Washington, where her mother had passed away just a week before.

The main character's full name is Dr. Ava Elizabeth Thompson.
