Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the docks, shrouding the narrow streets of Bristol's old town in a damp, gray mist. It was a chill autumn morning, the kind that made you want to wrap your scarf tighter around your neck and hurry home with a hot cup of tea in hand. But for Emilia "Mia" Fletcher, the fog held little appeal.

As she stepped out of her small flat above the butcher's shop on Lower Maudlin Street, the smell of fresh meat and salt wafted up to greet her, mingling with the sea air. Mia took a deep breath, feeling the familiar tug of her life as a butcher's apprentice. She had learned the art of cutting and trimming from her father, God rest his soul, who had taken over the family business after his own father passed away when he was just a boy.

Now, at twenty-five, Mia was taking on more responsibility herself, helping to keep the shop running smoothly as she prepared for the day's deliveries. The fog swirled around her ankles as she locked up the flat and made her way down into the shop, the sound of the city stirring outside growing louder with every step.

Inside, the smell of blood and sawdust mingled with the scent of yesterday's fish pies and fresh bread. Mia smiled to herself as she switched on the lights, the warm glow illuminating the rows of gleaming cuts of meat that lined the shelves like a colorful mosaic. It was going to be a good day.
