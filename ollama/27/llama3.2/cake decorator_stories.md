Inside one of these establishments, a small bakery called "Miel et Cacao," Aurora Fournier wiped away the sweat from her forehead as she surveyed her latest creation: a delicate sugar flower arrangement on top of a towering croquembouche.

Aurora, or Rory as she liked to be called, was a renowned cake decorator with a passion for creating edible works of art that rivaled those of the great masters. Her bakery, Miel et Cacao, had become a favorite among the city's elite, who came from all over to taste her innovative flavors and intricate designs.
