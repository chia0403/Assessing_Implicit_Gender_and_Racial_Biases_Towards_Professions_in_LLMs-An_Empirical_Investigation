Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Elliot Thompson, a renowned professor of medieval history at the prestigious University of Ashwood, stood at the edge of his office window, gazing out at the mist-shrouded streets of 14th-century London. The year was 1355, and the Black Death had been ravaging Europe for nearly four years, leaving behind a trail of death and destruction in its wake.

As he sipped his lukewarm tea, Professor Thompson's mind wandered to his latest research project: a study on the role of monastic orders during the plague. His eyes scanned the pages of dusty tomes scattered across his desk, filled with the works of medieval historians and theologians. The scratching of his pen against the parchment was the only sound breaking the silence of the evening.

The dim glow of candles casting flickering shadows on the walls seemed to echo the melancholy that had been settling over the professor's heart lately. It wasn't just the weight of his research or the pressure to publish in a field already saturated with scholars that troubled him, but something more personal. A sense of disconnection from the world around him, as if he was observing life through the lens of a dusty old book.

The door creaked open, and his assistant, Alice, entered with a tray bearing a steaming cup of coffee and a stack of letters. "Professor Thompson, your visitors have arrived," she said, her voice like music in the quiet evening air.

Professor Thompson's gaze snapped back to the present, his eyes narrowing slightly as he set aside his tea cup. He straightened his shoulders and took a deep breath, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead â€“ both within and outside the walls of his office.
