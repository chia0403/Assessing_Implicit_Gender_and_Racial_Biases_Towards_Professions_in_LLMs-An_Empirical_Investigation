Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, grey mist that seemed to cling to everything it touched. Dr. Emily Mae Wilson stood at her kitchen sink, staring out the window as she sipped her morning coffee and reviewed the day's schedule for the dental clinic she owned.

It was a typical Monday morning in Ravenswood - the kind of day where everyone knew their neighbors' names, but strangers were few and far between. The only sound was the distant hum of the ocean and the occasional bark of a dog. Emily felt a sense of peace wash over her as she gazed out at the sea, the rhythmic waves a reminder that there was more to life than the daily grind of dentistry.

At 35, Emily had built a successful practice in Ravenswood, earning a reputation for her gentle touch and warm bedside manner. She loved nothing more than helping patients achieve a healthy, confident smile - but as she scanned the day's appointments, one name caught her eye: Mrs. Jenkins, an elderly patient who had been on the waiting list for months.

Something about Mrs. Jenkins' case troubled Emily - a sense of unease that lingered long after she'd finished reviewing the files. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but something felt off. As she rinsed the dishes and turned to head out the door, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that this day was going to be anything but ordinary...
