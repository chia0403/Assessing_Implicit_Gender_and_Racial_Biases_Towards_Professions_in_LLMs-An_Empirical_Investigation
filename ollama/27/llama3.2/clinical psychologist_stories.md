Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Evelyn "Evie" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment and into the crisp autumn air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the bustling streets of downtown Seattle. As a clinical psychologist with a specialty in trauma and anxiety disorders, Evie was no stranger to the stresses of city life, but there was something about this particular morning that felt off.

The sun was shining, casting a golden glow over the crowded sidewalks and towering skyscrapers, but the usual sounds of car horns and chatter seemed muted today. Instead, Evie detected a faint hum of unease, like the quiet before a storm. She couldn't quite put her finger on it, but she knew that feeling all too well – it was one that had become an old companion in recent months.

Evie's mind began to wander back to her latest patient, a young woman named Sarah who had been struggling with nightmares and flashbacks since returning from deployment as a soldier in the military. Evie had been working with Sarah for weeks, trying to help her process the trauma she'd experienced during her time overseas, but the girl's progress had slowed significantly in recent days.

Feeling a twinge of concern, Evie checked her watch – 7:45 AM. She had a busy day ahead of her at the clinic, with several new patients and appointments to attend. As she made her way down the stairs and into the bright morning light, Evie couldn't shake the feeling that today was going to be different in some way, that whatever unease was lurking on the horizon would soon reveal itself.

And then, just as she was about to step onto the crowded bus that would take her to work, Evie saw him – a man standing on the sidewalk, his eyes locked intently on hers, a look of quiet intensity etched across his face.
