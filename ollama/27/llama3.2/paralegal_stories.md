Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Haven glistened like polished glass as Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment building, a haze of cigarette smoke trailing behind her like a bad omen. She took a deep breath, the cool mist filling her lungs, and began the short walk to the coffee shop where she worked as a paralegal at the law firm of Smith & Associates.

Lexi's boots splashed in the puddles, echoing off the towering skyscrapers that seemed to close in around her. She quickened her pace, anxious to escape the gloom outside and into the warm, golden light of the coffee shop's interior. As she pushed open the door, a bell above it rang out, announcing her arrival.

The coffee shop was bustling with activity - lawyers and clients rushing to grab a caffeine fix before their day began, or to meet with prospective clients who were looking for someone like Lexi: a smart, capable paralegal with a talent for organizing paperwork and a keen eye for detail. Lexi slid into a booth near the back, where she was waiting on her regular morning coffee, and began to sort through the stack of files and papers that had accumulated overnight.

Just as she was about to start reviewing her tasks for the day, Lexi's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her boss, Mr. Smith himself: "Lexi, we've got a new case coming in today. Client is anxious to meet with you ASAP."
