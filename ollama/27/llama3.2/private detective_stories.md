Here's a story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving at midnight. The city's neon lights reflected off the wet pavement like a mirage, casting an otherworldly glow over the rain-drenched alleys and side streets. It was in this very hour that I, August "Augie" Thompson, private detective, found myself drawn into the dark underbelly of the Emerald City.

I stood outside my office, a cramped but cozy space above a rundown diner on Pike Street, watching as the neon sign above the door flickered to life like a firefly. The words "Thompson Investigations" were etched in bold letters across the windowpane, a beacon for those who needed help finding themselves lost in the shadows of Seattle.

The rain drummed against my fedora, which was pulled low over one eye, casting a shadow over my face as I surveyed the night. My phone buzzed to life, shrill and insistent, cutting through the din of the city like a slap to the wrist. I sighed, knowing that this call was going to be a long one.

"Augie Thompson," I said, answering with a weary drawl, "what can I do for you tonight?"

The voice on the other end was low and husky, with an edge of desperation that made my gut twist into knots. "Augie, it's Sophie Patel. My sister is missing. The police aren't taking me seriously."

My mind kicked into high gear as I listened to Sophie's words, already spinning scenarios through my head like a detective on autopilot. Missing persons cases were always tricky, but when the stakes involved family and desperation, that made them downright deadly.

I lit a cigarette, feeling the nicotine coursing through my veins like a promise of answers. It was going to be a long night.

"Tell me everything," I said, exhaling a plume of smoke into the rain-soaked air.

Sophie's voice trembled on the other end of the line, "My sister, Leela...she was supposed to meet me at the coffee shop last night. She never showed up. The police just told us she must have gone out and gotten lost in the city."

I nodded, even though I knew Sophie couldn't see me. "Okay, let's start with what we know. When did you first notice Leela was missing?"

Sophie hesitated before answering, her words barely audible over the rain.

My gut told me this case was going to be a lot more complicated than it seemed...
