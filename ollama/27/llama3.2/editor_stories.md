Here's a story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished steel as Emma Elizabeth MacKenzie stepped out of her small flat on Regent Street, gazing up at the grey stone façade of the University of Edinburgh's main library. The wind whipped through her curly brown hair, carrying the scent of damp earth and old books. It was a familiar smell that filled her with comfort and inspiration.

As an editor for the university's publications office, Emma had spent countless hours within those hallowed halls, pouring over manuscripts and guiding students through the process of publishing their research. But tonight, she had come to the library for more than just work. She had received a mysterious letter from an unknown sender, inviting her to review a manuscript that promised to be the most challenging – and potentially life-changing – project of her career.

The letter, written in elegant script on expensive paper, hinted at a long-forgotten literary movement that had been thought lost forever, hidden away in dusty archives and forgotten texts. Emma's curiosity was piqued, and she couldn't shake the feeling that this manuscript might hold secrets about her own past – secrets she had never suspected existed.

With a deep breath, Emma pushed open the heavy wooden door and stepped into the warmth of the library, leaving the rain-soaked streets behind. Little did she know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take her to the very edges of her world – and beyond.
