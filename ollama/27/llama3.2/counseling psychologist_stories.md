Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Portland gleamed like polished onyx as Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office building and into the chilly evening air. She had just finished a particularly grueling session with a client, a young woman named Sarah who was struggling to come to terms with a traumatic event from her past. Lexi's empathetic nature and years of training as a counseling psychologist had helped Sarah take a tentative step forward, but the road ahead would be long and arduous.

As she gazed up at the city skyline, Lexi felt a sense of disconnection wash over her. It was as if the weight of her work – listening to people's deepest fears and insecurities, trying to help them find their way in a chaotic world – had finally caught up with her. She had always been driven by a desire to make a difference, to leave the world a better place than she found it. But lately, the toll of her job seemed to be taking its own toll on her.

Lexi took a deep breath and began the short walk to her car, parked in a lot just a block away from her office. The neon lights of the city's bars and restaurants reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted streets. It was a night like any other in Portland – grey, rainy, and melancholy – but Lexi felt like she was standing on the edge of something, waiting for the waters to rise.
