Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Manhattan reflected off the wet pavement like a dark mirror, casting a somber glow over the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. Inside the cozy office of Smith & Co., accounting firm, Emily Anne Thompson sat hunched over her desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty ledgers and forgotten dreams.

As an accountant with over a decade of experience, Emily had seen it all - from the thrill of closing a big deal to the agony of watching a client's finances spiral out of control. But on this particular drizzly Monday morning, Emily's mind was preoccupied with something far more pressing: the mysterious audit notice that had arrived in the mail just as she was sipping her coffee.

The letter, with its stark red ink and official-looking stamp, seemed to taunt her from across the desk, daring her to unravel the tangled web of financial records that lay before her. Little did Emily know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would take her down a rabbit hole of deceit, corruption, and secrets hidden in plain sight.

How's that?
