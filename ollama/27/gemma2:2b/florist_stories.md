The air hung thick with honeysuckle and the promise of rain in the late summer afternoon. The sky was bruised purple, mirroring the fading color of the poppies lining Amelia Evermore's storefront window.  Her shop, "Evermore Blooms," was nestled into the heart of Willow Creek village, surrounded by cozy cottages and a cobbled square where children chased pigeons. 

Amelia Evermore was not your average florist. Her hands weren't simply skilled in weaving petals together; they possessed an artistry that defied logic, turning simple stems and buds into miniature works of natural art. She had an uncanny ability to coax life from dried flowers, creating intricate bouquets that whispered forgotten tales with every bloom.  But lately, even Amelia's magic couldn't overcome the creeping sense of foreboding that settled on her like a shroud. 


As the first raindrops began to splatter against the windowpane, Amelia sighed, tucking a strand of auburn hair behind her ear and looking out at the grey sky. Something was changing. Something ominous.  The flowers were wilting, their usual vibrant hues fading into a muted grayscale, mirroring the growing sense of unease within her heart.
