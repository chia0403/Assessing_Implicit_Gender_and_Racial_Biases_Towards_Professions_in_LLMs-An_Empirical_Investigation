The salt air whipped Amelia's hair around her face as she surveyed the sprawling beach scene before her. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and pink. Her small town clinic, nestled on the edge of the boardwalk, hummed with the quiet energy of healing hands and soothing whispers. This was Serenity Springs Chiro, a haven for those seeking relief from the relentless grind of modern life. A name that Amelia held dear to her heart, but one she hadn't quite mastered in its full potential. 

Amelia "Amy" Thompson, licensed chiropractor and owner, stood bathed in the golden glow of dusk. Her eyes scanned the bustling beach scene: families laughing on the sand, teenagers playing volleyball, couples sharing stolen glances under the starlit sky.  But it was the lone figure huddled on the weathered boardwalk bench that drew her attention. 

He was a man in his late forties, dressed in an oversized windbreaker and a fedora pulled low over his eyes. The way he hunched forward, head down, shoulders slumped, spoke of unseen turmoil and years of suppressed pain. He looked like someone who'd been carrying the world on his weary back for far too long, and Amy knew she couldn't just walk past him.
