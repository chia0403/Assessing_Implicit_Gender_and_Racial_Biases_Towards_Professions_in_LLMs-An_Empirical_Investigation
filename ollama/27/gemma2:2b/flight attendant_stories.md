The salty air stung Amelia's nostrils as she leaned precariously against the starboard wing of the Boeing 747, its shadow engulfing her like a protective beast. The Hawaiian sun, already scorching even at dawn, beat down on the tarmac, mirroring the heat building in Amelia’s chest. Her name tag read “Amelia ‘Amy' Carter," and beneath it, a small, worn photo of a grinning woman with eyes that held the same sky blue as the island she now stood on, seemed to whisper "Welcome Home."  But home felt like an ocean away. 

The flight from San Francisco to Honolulu was normally a routine hop across the Pacific, but today, Amy’s world had tilted on its axis. Her grandmother, who'd taught her to dream in the clouds and carry them through the air with every step she took, had passed just three days prior, leaving behind not only a gaping hole in Amy’s heart but also a suitcase brimming with memories.  

This wasn’t just another flight; it was a pilgrimage, a promise whispered by the wind: to find her own wings.
