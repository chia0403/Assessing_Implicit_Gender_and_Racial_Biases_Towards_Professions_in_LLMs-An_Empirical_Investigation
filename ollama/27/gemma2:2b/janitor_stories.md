The smell of stale coffee lingered in the air, clinging to every corner of the sprawling, gothic library like an unwelcome ghost. The only source of light came from the faint yellow glow emanating from the old gas lamps that dotted the grand halls and illuminated rows upon rows of dusty tomes. Even in this dim world of parchment and inkwells, where time seemed to flow at a glacial pace, there was a certain magic, an unseen spark that crackled between the pages and danced on the edges of whispers heard only by those who dared listen.

This was Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's domain.  He was not a man of words, yet he understood the silent language of the library better than any scholar or librarian. For years, Bart had been the unseen guardian, the anonymous whisperer in the echoing halls of this forgotten kingdom of knowledge. He wiped away the dust motes that danced with each gust of wind through the ancient arched doorway, and for Bart, the quiet rustle was almost as comforting as a song sung by a thousand angels. 

Today, however, a new energy buzzed around him.  It started when he noticed the strange light dancing on his broom at dusk, casting fleeting shadows across the floor. The light pulsed with an erratic rhythm that seemed to beckon him closer. He couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.
