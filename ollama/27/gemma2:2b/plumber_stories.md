The aroma of stale coffee mingled with the metallic tang of rust clung to the worn air ducts in Mr. Edgar "Digger" Diggs' workshop. Outside, the drizzle lashed against the grimy windows, each drop echoing like tiny drums on the tin roof. The sky was bruised purple and black, mirroring the state of his mood. Three days without a call. Three days without even a single, flickering hope. 

Edgar "Digger" Diggs wasn't your typical plumber. He didn't wear a pristine uniform or smile as he walked into a customer’s home, ready to “fix” their leaky faucet with the grace of a surgeon. No, Digger was a man of dirt and grease; his hands calloused from years spent wrestling with pipes, bending metal, and chasing elusive leaks. He spoke in grunts and shrugs, his voice a gravelly baritone that rumbled like an old engine. But underneath it all lay a quiet, unwavering determination. His family's legacy had been built on fixing things, one leaky faucet at a time. 

Now, with the drizzle starting to turn into a torrent, Digger sat hunched over a pile of greasy pipe fittings in his workshop, each one a testament to his frustration. The storm outside was mirroring the tempest within him. It wasn't just about the lack of work; it was about losing that familiar rhythm, that constant hum of activity that had defined his existence for decades.
