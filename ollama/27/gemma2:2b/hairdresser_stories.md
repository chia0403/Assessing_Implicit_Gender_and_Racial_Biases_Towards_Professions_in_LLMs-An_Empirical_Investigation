The air in "Shear Bliss" was thick with the smell of hairspray and dreams.  A kaleidoscope of colours swirled from the vibrant dyes in every corner – fuchsia explosions on one wall, sunflower yellow next to it, then a serene blue serenity on another. But amidst this sensory overload, Amelia “Amy” Thorne stood in her haven, her hands gliding through a client’s thick, unruly hair like she was navigating a sea of silk. 

Her salon wasn't just a place for haircuts; it was an island of calm and creativity, tucked away in the heart of bustling Downtown City. The constant bustle outside – honking cabs, screeching trams, hurried footsteps - faded into a distant hum as Amy’s nimble fingers worked, coaxing order from chaos. This wasn’t just her job, it was her lifeblood. 


Amy had inherited this haven from her grandmother, a woman whispered to be possessed of an uncanny ability to blend art and hair.  Every strand in the salon carried echoes of her legacy – each snip, each colour, each style woven into the fabric of time, a testament to a lineage that stretched back generations.
