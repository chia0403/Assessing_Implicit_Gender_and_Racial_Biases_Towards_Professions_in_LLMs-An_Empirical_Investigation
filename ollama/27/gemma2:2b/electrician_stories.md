The flickering fluorescent lights of the abandoned warehouse hummed a discordant symphony to Marcus "Mac" O'Connell.  Dust motes danced in the harsh beams, swirling like phantoms against the peeling paint on the concrete walls. Mac hunched over his toolbox, a tangle of wires and tools reflecting his own fatigue. His calloused hands tightened around an inch-thick bolt, and for a moment, he felt the weight of years – not just the physical strain of hauling boxes and bending metal, but the burdens of a past that refused to let go. 

He was a man defined by sparks and circuits, a craftsman who found solace in the hum and crackle of electricity. It wasn't glamorous work; it was often dirty, dangerous, and filled with men as rough and rugged as the old buildings he fixed up. Yet, for Mac, it offered a rhythm that resonated deep within him – an echo of something vital and primal.  

This warehouse in the forgotten corner of the city held secrets – stories told by creaking floorboards and stained glass windows, whispers carried on the wind from long-gone workers who left their mark. The air hung thick with the ghosts of a time when dreams were forged under these very beams, before the city swallowed them whole. Now, Mac was here to unravel those threads, piece by piece, trying to understand what remained of the lives lost in this forgotten space.
