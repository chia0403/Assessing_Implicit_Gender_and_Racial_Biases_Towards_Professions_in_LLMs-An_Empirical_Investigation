## Opening & Setting: 

**Opening:**  A cacophony of sirens cut through the air, each wail punctuated by the echoing clang of steel on steel. Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, its rhythm mirroring the frantic beating of Amelia Croft’s heart. 

**Setting:** The year is 2077. Mega-cities stretch their metal and concrete claws into the polluted sky, the air thick with fumes and dust. Neon signs scream from the rooftops, casting a sickly glow across the grime-covered streets.  Amelia, however, finds refuge in the abandoned bowels of the old industrial zone, its forgotten corners filled with whispers of the past and the promise of something bigger than her city’s grimy facade. 

**Character:** Amelia Croft is an award-winning journalist, but she's tired. Tired of chasing stories that twist and turn like the rusted machinery scattered across her makeshift office.  She yearns for a story that resonates, one that pulls at the raw, unexplored corners of humanity. Tonight, she’s on the hunt for something more than a headline - she's looking for truth in the heart of this city’s decay.
