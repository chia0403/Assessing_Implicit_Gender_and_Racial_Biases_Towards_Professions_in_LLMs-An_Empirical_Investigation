## Setting: 

The humid Louisiana air hung thick as molasses, clinging to Edgar "Mac" MacAllister like a damp towel.  He adjusted his starched collar, beads of sweat already forming on his forehead as he surveyed the ramshackle two-story building. This wasn't exactly an ideal office – more akin to a dusty attic than an insurance agency. The chipped paint was peeling, revealing glimpses of the raw wood beneath. A broken awning overhead offered scant protection from the relentless sun. 

Mac himself wasn’t much for fancy; he had his ways, sure, but never indulged in the frills of "success."  He just knew business – and his family's insurance legacy – was his lifeblood. He ran "Mac's Bayou Claims," a moniker passed down through generations. Now, though, it felt more like holding onto a tattered dream than a tangible reality.


## Main character:

**Edgar "Mac" MacAllister:**  Not your typical slick-talking agent.  He’s weathered by the Louisiana humidity and salt spray of the bayou. A scar above his left eye tells tales of days spent dodging angry storm surges, while his calloused hands tell stories of fixing broken fences and helping locals navigate their insurance nightmares.  He's got a gruff demeanor that hides a surprising empathy for those who find themselves struggling with life’s unexpected twists.
