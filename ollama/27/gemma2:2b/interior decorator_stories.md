The aroma of jasmine and citrus clung to the air like a second skin, a scent that Amelia "Amy" Thorne knew by heart.  It was woven into the fabric of her world – an eclectic mix of vintage patterns, vibrant florals, and soft, lived-in textures – all brought together to craft spaces that whispered comfort and beauty. Her latest project was a testament to this: a grand Victorian manor perched on the edge of a sleepy coastal town in Cornwall.  The house, once a grand showcase of its time, now lay shrouded in dust and neglect, yearning for the touch of life.

Amy's heart thumped with the familiar anticipation that came before stepping into a blank canvas. The floorboards groaned under her boots as she pushed open the heavy oak door, sunlight filtering through dusty panes like a shy sunrise. A faint creak, like a tired sigh, announced the house’s age and longing.  It was a story waiting to be told.
