The air hung thick and sweet with the scent of meat –  a heady mix of iron, smoke, and freshly cut grass. It was the kind of smell that clung to you like a second skin, an aroma both comforting and strangely unsettling to anyone who wasn't bound to the trade like Elias Cutter was. His shop, "Cutter's Country Cuts," stood on the edge of Willow Creek, a bustling town nestled amongst rolling farmland and whispering pines.  The years had etched their marks on his face – deep-set blue eyes framed by silvering brows, and lips permanently pressed in a weary frown that seemed to reflect the endless cycle of slaughtering and slicing life's bounty.

Elias was no stranger to the symphony of death that played out each day at his shop. The rhythmic clang of the cleaver on bone, the soft gurgle of blood rushing from a freshly slaughtered ox, all blended into a strangely calming soundtrack. It was a world he knew intimately, one where the weight of responsibility sat heavy on his shoulders like the mantle of the butcher's knife itself.
