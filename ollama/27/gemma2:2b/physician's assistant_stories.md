The humid air hung thick as tar over the bustling city, clinging to Amelia Reyes like a second skin. It was the kind of day that made even seasoned New Yorkers look longingly for a breeze, and her tiny apartment, nestled between a boisterous vegan bakery and a repair shop whose exhaust fumes never seemed to dissipate, was no respite. A symphony of rumbling buses, screeching brakes, and the endless chatter of the city filled every corner. 

Amelia pulled out her worn leather journal from under the stack of unread novels on her bedside table. It was routine, she knew, but still a comfort in this chaotic world. Each day, after navigating the labyrinthine corridors of Mercy General Hospital and wrestling with paperwork that seemed to multiply overnight, she found solace in writing down observations, fleeting thoughts, even random haiku inspired by the city's cacophony. She flipped to the last page, her pen hovering over a blank line as if caught between two worlds, when she glimpsed it: a small, almost invisible scratch on the corner of her journal's cover - the same shape as a crescent moon.  A shiver ran down her spine.  What did it mean? 

Her thoughts were interrupted by the incessant ringing of her phone, jolting Amelia from her quiet introspection. It was Dr. Chen, her supervisor at the hospital. He needed to see her. The urgency in his voice, even through the static on the phone, sent a prickle of unease down her spine.
