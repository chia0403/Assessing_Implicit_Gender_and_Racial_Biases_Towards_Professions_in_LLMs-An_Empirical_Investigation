## Setting:

The city breathes in a thick layer of smog, its sky perpetually bruised by industrial grey. Rain slicks the cobblestones like black oil, reflecting neon signs that scream promises of escape and comfort. The air hums with an electric undercurrent, a tension palpable even to those who've lived here their whole lives. This is New Amsterdam, a city where every roof has a story, and each one whispers secrets in the wind.

## Character: 

**Reuben "Rusty" Sterling** isn't your average roofer.  His calloused hands have built lives on buildings that scrape the sky, but his soul yearns for something more than the endless expanse of concrete and steel. He dreams of a quiet cottage in the woods, away from the incessant clamor of the city, where he could mend weathered fences and listen to the songbirds sing instead of the siren-song of despair echoing off the factory walls.

**Opening:** 

The late afternoon light turned the air thick with heat as Rusty swung precariously on the rusted ladder, his toolbox clattering like a rogue heartbeat against his worn leather apron. He scanned the building opposite him, its chipped brick facade mirroring the weary state of his own soul. This was another one - a dingy apartment block overlooking a bustling street choked by traffic and ambition. 

He closed his eyes for a moment, letting the rhythmic scrape of his tools echo in the silence between the roars of honking cars. He pictured it: a small cottage, surrounded by rolling hills. The kind you'd find tucked away on a postcard, where the air smelled of pine and earth, not exhaust fumes and concrete dust. 

Rusty sighed, his gaze fixated on a stray pigeon perched precariously on the edge of a rooftop. "Another day," he muttered under his breath, his voice rough like gravel. "Just another day."
