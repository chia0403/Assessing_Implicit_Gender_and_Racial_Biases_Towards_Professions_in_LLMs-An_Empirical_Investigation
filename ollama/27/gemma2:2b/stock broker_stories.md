The air in Richard “Richie” Winthrop’s office hung thick with the scent of old money and stale ambition.  The floor-to-ceiling windows looked out onto the glassy expanse of Wall Street, where shimmering skyscrapers scraped the cloudless blue sky. Inside, Richie's meticulously manicured office resembled a controlled chaos: sleek leather chairs sat amongst stacks of reports in a near perfect symmetry, while a massive antique mahogany desk gleamed under harsh fluorescent lights.  He tapped his fingers impatiently on the polished surface, waiting for his next big play to unfold.

Outside, the city hummed with frenetic energy; a relentless dance of ambition and desperation played out between the gleaming titans of finance and the hopeful young guns eager to climb the corporate ladder. But Richie saw it all differently: he felt like a detached observer in his own reality, a king surveying his kingdom from behind heavy velvet curtains.  His phone buzzed on the desk – another high-profile client wanted to discuss options, but Richie knew there was something more at play today, a feeling of urgency that rippled through him like an undertow.
