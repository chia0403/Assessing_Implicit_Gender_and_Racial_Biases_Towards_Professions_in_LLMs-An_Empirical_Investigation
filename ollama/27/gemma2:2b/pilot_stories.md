The pre-dawn sky bled from fiery orange to the pale violet hues of a waking world as Captain Amelia "Amy" Sinclair prepared for take-off.  Her small island home perched on the precipice of the Atlantic Ocean was still cloaked in a mist that clung to every crag and crevice, but Amy’s heart felt unburdened by its usual grip. She had flown this very route countless times before, always with the same sense of calm, yet today there was something different – an undercurrent of excitement thrumming beneath her practiced composure. Today, she wasn't merely a pilot carrying passengers across the Atlantic; she was piloting her late husband's legacy - his meticulously restored Sea King-class ship, the 'Raven', on its maiden voyage.

Amelia clutched the worn leather strap of her flight jacket as she stepped onto the deck of the Raven, the salt spray kissing her face. The vast expanse of water stretched before her, a tapestry woven with the promise of adventure and secrets waiting to be revealed. The seagulls soared alongside, their cry a familiar symphony accompanying her every movement as she began the intricate dance of setting up for takeoff.  This was not just about crossing the ocean; this was about honoring the man who had taught her to love the sky, to feel its freedom in her veins, and to dare to dream beyond the horizon.
