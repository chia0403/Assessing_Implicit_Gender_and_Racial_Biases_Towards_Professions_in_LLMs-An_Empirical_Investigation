The whine of static filled the airwaves like a thousand angry bees, only punctuated by the rhythmic clicking of Earl "Echo" Peterson's tool kit as he tightened a bolt on his portable transmitter. A lone figure silhouetted against the dying glow of the setting sun sat perched atop the weather vane on the old radio tower, its rusted steel frame groaning in protest under the weight of Echo's weary body. The air was thick with the smell of ozone and salt from the endless tide, and a low, mournful cry echoed across the empty expanse – the sound of the distant city fading beneath the encroaching ocean.

Echo, a man weathered and worn like the old tower itself, held his breath as he tuned in to the frequency that crackled on the airwaves: 140.9. His eyes scanned the digital display, each click of the dial bringing him closer to the signal. A faint, hopeful whisper of sound emerged from the static, a single note, melancholic and lonely. It was a song, an old melody he hadn't heard in years – his grandmother's lullaby sung on a forgotten radio. 

This was it. The moment he’d been waiting for since the storm hit, severing the last connection to civilization. He felt the salt spray sting his face and knew that the storm had delivered more than just rain and wind – it had brought whispers of hope.
