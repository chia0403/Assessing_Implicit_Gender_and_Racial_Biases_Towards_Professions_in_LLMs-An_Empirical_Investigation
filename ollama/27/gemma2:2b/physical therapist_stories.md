The scent of antiseptic and damp linen hung thick in the air, mingling with the tired cries of patients attempting to walk again.  Evelyn "Evy" Thorne, PT, leaned against the wall of the rehabilitation gym, her gaze fixed on the door.  Her usual stoic face was etched with worry lines that hinted at the weight she carried - the weight of a thousand unspoken anxieties and unsent apologies. 

Today, Evelyn's carefully constructed routine of controlled chaos had been shattered by a single letter. A stark, unyielding piece of paper delivered like a punch to her gut. The handwriting on it was meticulous, almost too perfect for someone with such an unconventional life: "Evelyn," the message read, each word heavy with expectation and tinged with something colder than ice. “I need you. Please come.”

The setting was a small-town rehabilitation center in the heart of rural Montana, where time seemed to move in molasses compared to the dizzying pace of the big city. Evelyn, once a rising star in physical therapy, had found herself drawn back to this humble sanctuary after years away. The quiet whispers of "Old Evy" and the worn wood floors held her memories like ghosts, each one tugging at the edges of her present reality.
