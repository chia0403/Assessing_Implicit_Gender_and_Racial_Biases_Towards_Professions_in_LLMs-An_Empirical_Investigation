The air hung thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth as Elias Thorne, his weathered face creased in thought, surveyed the forest floor. Sunlight filtered through the ancient trees, casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe like phantoms on the moss-covered ground. The old growth pines, giants who had seen centuries pass, stood sentinel against the encroaching darkness of evening. A symphony of chirps and croaks echoed from the dense undergrowth as nightbirds began their nightly flight. 

Elias was a third-generation logger, his name echoing through the generations like a weathered ballad. His grandfather, Jacob Thorne, had taught him how to read the language of trees – how to identify each species by its bark, how to discern the health of a fallen limb from miles away, and how to coax life out of a stubborn log with just a touch of his axe. Now, Elias, the woodsman’s son, was carrying on that legacy, though the forest felt different today, darker than usual. A weight of foreboding settled upon him like a dense fog. 

The silence broken only by the crunch of his boots underfoot, he pushed forward, the worn leather strap of his axe digging into his hand, its familiar weight grounding him in the heart of the woods. He needed answers, and the forest had a way of whispering them to those who knew how to listen.
