The aroma of lilac shampoo, lavender conditioner, and freshly cut hair hung in the air like a sweet symphony.  Amelia "Amy" Evergreen adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses as she leaned back against her mahogany-colored chair, watching the storm rage outside. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her salon, “Evergreen Elegance,” casting the room in an ever-shifting palette of greys and greens. 

The roar of thunder occasionally punctuated by the insistent patter of rain was a familiar backdrop to Amy's life. She had grown up just down the street from this small town of Briarwood, where every house boasted ivy-laden walls and oak trees that whispered secrets in the wind. It wasn’t exactly a bustling metropolis, but it held a quiet charm that Amy treasured.  Her clientele – a mix of gossiping housewives, nervous brides, and self-absorbed teenagers – flocked to her salon like moths to a flame. 

Tonight was no different. A young woman with wide, worried eyes sat across from Amy, nervously fiddling with a strand of hair pulled tightly back in a ponytail.  Amy had a knack for calming anxious nerves before she even started snipping away at the woman's thick auburn curls. It felt like an old routine, yet tonight, there was something different about the woman’s apprehension, something that seemed to pulse beneath her surface.
