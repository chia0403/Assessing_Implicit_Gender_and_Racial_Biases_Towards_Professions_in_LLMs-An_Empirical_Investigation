The rhythmic clang of his hammer echoed against the granite cliffs, a constant soundtrack to Elara’s life. She was known as "Stonehand" amongst the townsfolk, for her weathered hands held more skill than any man, and yet, the same calluses on her fingertips hinted at a heart too fragile for such brutal work. Elara worked tirelessly in the ancient quarry just outside Aella's Hollow – a crumbling monument to forgotten grandeur now home to only a few stone cutters like herself. Dust settled thick as a fog across the weathered surfaces of the massive granite blocks, and Elara worked with a practiced precision, carving intricate designs into their surface before transporting them away for use in Aella’s Hollow's grand new cathedral. 

The setting sun painted the sky in hues of burnt orange and violet, casting long shadows on the jagged edges of the quarry as Elara leaned back against her weathered workbench, a small cup of herbal tea warming her hands.  She sighed, gazing upon the vast emptiness of the landscape – just another day spent carving away at stone's silent secrets.
