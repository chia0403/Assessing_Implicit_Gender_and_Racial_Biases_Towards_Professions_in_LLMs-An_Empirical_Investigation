Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Emily Grace's head.  It was another Friday afternoon at Willow Creek High, and the familiar symphony of teenage angst was playing on loop. As she sat behind her desk in the staff room, surrounded by the aroma of stale coffee and forgotten lunch trays, Emily felt a tug of anxiety, not unlike that of the pre-test jitters she knew so well from decades spent working with anxious teens. 

Emily was no stranger to the challenges of adolescence; she had dedicated her career to understanding the minds of teenagers struggling in their own unique ways. But today, something felt different. The usual whirlwind of presentations, referrals, and student-teacher meetings seemed particularly heavy, leaving Emily feeling drained.  Her eyes darted across a sea of crumpled reports and handwritten notes - each one a silent testament to the countless anxieties that plagued these kids. 

It was her first year at Willow Creek High, and she couldn't shake off a feeling that this school held a specific kind of darkness, a hidden undercurrent of unspoken turmoil. The air felt thick with unspoken tension, like a storm gathering on the horizon waiting to break free in a crescendo of despair.
