The late afternoon sun bled over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple as Eleanor "Elle" Thorne surveyed the dilapidated Victorian mansion from her rented Ford Focus.  Her crisp white blouse was incongruously out of place against the dusty grime coating the weathered façade. This wasn't Elle’s usual domain - high-rises and modern condos were where the real estate game truly played. Today, however, she found herself on the precipice of something... wilder. 

The sprawling mansion, known locally as Blackwood Manor, sat on a windswept hill overlooking a treacherous stretch of coast. It was infamous for its tragic history, whispers of hidden tunnels and abandoned laboratories swirling in the town’s air. The local paper called it "a relic of a bygone era," but Elle saw potential. Not just in selling this sprawling monument to past grandeur, but in uncovering its secrets. 

Elle adjusted her sunglasses, a wry smile playing on her lips as she clicked on the GPS app. "Alright Blackwood," she muttered, "let's see what you've got."  The air hung thick with salt and a strange, unsettling energy that seemed to hum beneath the surface of this forgotten place.  Today, Elle would not only sell a house; she was going to uncover a story.
