The scent of linseed oil and sawdust clung to Elara's worn leather apron like a second skin. It was a familiar smell, one that had filled her days for the past ten years since she joined the small architectural drafting firm, "Aetherworks."  The workshop, nestled in a quiet corner of the bustling city, hummed with the soft whirring of the computer printers and the measured clicks of mechanical pencils. Outside, the morning light poured through dusty windows, painting the worn wooden floorboards in an ethereal glow. Today was no different than any other - until it wasn't.

Elara stared out at the swirling grey sky over the construction site across the street. It felt strangely heavy that day, like a lead weight pressing against her chest.  The site was where she had grown up, once a sprawling playground before the city began to swallow it whole. Now, it was a concrete jungle of rising structures, each one promising progress and prosperity, but leaving behind only an echoing silence in its wake. Elara felt strangely detached from this world now; her days were spent translating blueprints into reality for the architects who built these giants, but she longed to build something more than walls and facades - a story that held within it a touch of life's magic, like the way sunlight refracted through water to paint rainbows on the surface.  But how? 

Elara glanced down at her sketchpad. A simple design: a single tree, its branches reaching out towards the sky, its roots spreading deep into the earth. She wondered if she could find a place for that in this bustling city of steel and glass. Or maybe, it was meant to stay hidden, a secret whisper in the wind, a silent echo of something lost.
