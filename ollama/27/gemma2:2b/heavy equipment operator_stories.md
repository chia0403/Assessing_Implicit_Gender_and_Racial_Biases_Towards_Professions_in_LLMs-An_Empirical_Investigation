The sun beat down on Jericho Cross’ weathered face like a hammer against a tin roof. His thick, calloused hands clutched the steering wheel of his monstrous earth-mover, affectionately nicknamed "Iron Jaw." The air hung thick and gritty, the smell of diesel fuel and freshly-tilled soil permeating everything as he prepared to start his shift at the sprawling construction site on the outskirts of Elyria, Ohio. 

Jericho was a man carved by sweat and steel, every inch of him bearing witness to years spent battling wind and weather, dirt and dust, in the brutal symphony of building something new from the ground up. His heavy equipment had become an extension of himself; his rough hands danced on the controls, each rumble and groan of "Iron Jaw" a familiar lullaby. Elyria was his canvas, and the construction site his ever-expanding masterpiece. He’d built bridges, dug trenches, leveled hills - all under the watchful eye of the setting sun and the silent ghosts of countless laborers who'd paved the way before him. 


But today felt different. A strange unease clung to Jericho like a storm cloud, threatening to burst over his stoic exterior. The silence felt heavier than usual as he surveyed the vast emptiness of the construction site, each machine a sentinel standing guard in the midday heat. Something was amiss. It wasn't just the unsettling quiet or the unusual way the wind seemed to whisper secrets through the scaffolding; it was the feeling that something was about to crack, and break under the immense pressure building behind the facade of progress.
