The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Silas Blackwood's sunflower field, turning the golden stalks into elongated, menacing fingers. The air hung thick with heat and the sweet perfume of pollen, a fragrance that clung to his calloused hands and the straw-colored hair that streaked from his face like threads of wheat. Silas, his weathered face creased in thought, gazed out over his family legacy - his father's orchard, now mostly gone, replaced by rows of sunflowers that stretched for miles across the flat plain. 

It was a stubborn thing this farm. A stubborn sun, a stubborn soil, and a stubborn silence that hung like fog over the valley. Silas had inherited every last bit of it, every scar on his land and in his soul. But he yearned to break it, to plant something different, something that would breathe life into the monotonous rhythm of his days. He just didn't know what. 

The silence was punctuated by the distant cawing of crows, circling overhead as if to weigh down the sky with their heavy presence.  Tonight, Silas would travel back into the old orchard, a place where memories lingered thicker than the dust on the ground. His father had told him stories about this land: tales of hardship and hope, whispered in the wind that rustled through the trees now skeletal and bare.
