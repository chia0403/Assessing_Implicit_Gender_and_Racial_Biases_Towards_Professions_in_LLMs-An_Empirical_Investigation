Rain lashed against the tiny windowpanes of Harold "Harry" Henderson's office, each drop like a hammer blow on the worn tin roof.  He squinted at the flickering fluorescent light above his cluttered desk, barely catching sight of the scattered receipts and year-end reports before them. He hadn't left his tax prep sanctuary for nearly two years now - even the occasional call from his sister about needing some "fresh air" had been met with a polite but firm refusal. Harry loved routine: each client's story unfolding like a meticulously organized puzzle, each deduction like a tiny gear turning in an intricate machine that somehow delivered his yearly reward of quiet and solitude. 

This year, though, the familiar rhythm was missing its usual heartbeat.  The clients were coming slower than usual, and the whispers of a recession had settled over the town with a heavy gloom, chilling Harry's usually optimistic disposition. The air hung thick with unspoken anxieties as he sorted through the forms before him, each one a tiny map to another person's financial journey - a journey that, for some, was leading them down a dangerous path.  He wondered what would become of them, and if he could even help guide them through it all.
