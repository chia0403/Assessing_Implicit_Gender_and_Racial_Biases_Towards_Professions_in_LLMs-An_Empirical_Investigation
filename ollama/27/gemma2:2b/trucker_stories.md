## The Last Light of Dusk

The asphalt stretched out before him like a ribbon of black oil shimmering under the fading sun.  Dust devils danced along the highway, swirling lazily in the dying light, mirroring the internal turmoil brewing within **Dalton Stonebridge** himself. Each mile marker felt heavier than the last, each passing town blurring together into a monotonous symphony of chrome and diesel. He was hauling another load of steel beams, destined for some nameless factory miles away, but he couldn't shake off the feeling that this journey held more meaning than just a paycheck.

Dalton wasn't like the other truckers who found solace in their routines.  He wasn't built for the steady beat of the engine, the predictable rhythms of the open road. Dalton felt the rhythm of his soul in every shift of the gears, every hum of the diesel. The highway was a canvas for him, and each turn, each stop, each fleeting conversation with another traveler on the road a brushstroke in his ever-evolving masterpiece - an artwork he could never quite decipher himself. 

He gripped the steering wheel tighter, the worn leather warm against his calloused hands. It felt as if the setting sun itself was bleeding down onto him, a somber red mirroring the anxieties churning within him.  Somewhere beyond the horizon, Dalton knew, lay the edge of something bigger - a truth he could feel but couldn't quite grasp, like a melody humming in the back of his mind, waiting to be played.
