Rain hammered against the windowpane, mirroring the relentless thrumming in Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne's chest.  The fluorescent lights hummed above her, casting a sterile pallor over the rows of chairs crammed into the waiting room. The pungent aroma of disinfectant and something vaguely floral - an unfortunate mix of bleach and hand cream – hung heavy in the air. Ellie adjusted her scrubs, their once pristine white now speckled with the grime of countless patient encounters. 

Ellie was no stranger to needles, not after years spent flitting from one hospital to another, drawing blood like a meticulous painter using fine brushes on a canvas of human suffering. But tonight, there was something different in the air – a distinct tension that had nothing to do with the usual anxieties of a busy Tuesday.  The waiting room door creaked open, and a figure stepped out into the dim light, his silhouette obscured by the downpour outside. 

"Ellie," he said, his voice deep and gravelly like an old recording player on repeat. "Come in."
