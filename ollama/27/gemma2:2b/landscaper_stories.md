The early morning mist clung to the city like a forgotten dream, its tendrils crawling up the metal legs of the rusted fire escape where Thomas "Tommy" McArthur perched.  He inhaled deeply, the air thick with dampness and the scent of pine needles from the last batch of evergreen he'd just finished trimming.  At twenty-five, Tommy was a man of few words and even fewer smiles, but his calloused hands told a story: years spent sweating under the unforgiving sun, carving beauty out of concrete jungle and coaxing life from soil choked by neglect.

Tommy knew every inch of this rundown section of Elmwood - the faded murals on forgotten buildings, the gossiping squirrels in the old oak tree, even the chipped paint of Mrs. O’Malley's house where the last remaining rose bush bloomed defiantly against its brick facade.  For Tommy, it wasn't just a job; it was his sanctuary, a place where the concrete and steel could somehow breathe with life, where weeds were not just unwelcome guests but tiny soldiers fighting for their right to exist. 

Today, though, something felt different. There was an edge to the morning air, a prickle of anticipation that Tommy couldn't quite name.  It wasn't his usual worry about Mrs. O’Malley’s grumpy neighbor or the ever-present threat of leaky pipes from the aging apartment building next door.  This was bigger. More… urgent.
