The rain hammered against the glass windows of "Snip & Style," blurring the neon glow of the city's skyline into an angry smear of blues and greens. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of peppermint oil and damp wool.  Evelyn Thorne, known to some as "Ev" and to others only as "The Clipper," ran a hand through her messy auburn hair as she surveyed the chaos. 

It was Wednesday night, prime-time for haircuts and gossip, and the chair beside her wasn't even half full. A few stray strands of blonde bobbed up from beneath a chipped ceramic coffee cup left on the floor. The clientele had been scarce tonight - a quiet Tuesday in an otherwise bustling city. Evelyn sighed. It was no fault of hers that she lived above the shop, and thus had to face a rather dramatic weather pattern every single week.
 
Evelyn leaned against the worn counter, her gaze drifting towards the open newspaper on a dusty shelf, its headlines barely legible under a layer of rain-soaked grime.  She ran a comb through a stray strand of auburn hair. A customer was bound to walk in any minute, she thought. It had to be a matter of time before someone with enough grit to brave this downpour decided to take the plunge and get their hair done.
