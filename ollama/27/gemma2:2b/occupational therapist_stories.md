Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the chaotic storm brewing inside Amelia's heart. Outside, the coastal town of Oceanside huddled under grey clouds, its usual serenity replaced by an unsettling gloom.  Inside her cramped office in the Seahaven Clinic, Amelia was wrestling with something far more insidious than the relentless weather: the case of 10-year-old Ben.

Amelia knew all too well that a child’s life could be shattered with just one wrong turn, and she'd been thrust into that very reality when she had met Ben -  an energetic boy who loved building sandcastles and chasing butterflies, but whose body now held a heavy secret: his recent fall from the swing set at the local park had left him paralyzed. 

The sight of Ben’s limp arm, frozen in a moment of pure, unintended disaster, had been like a punch to the gut.  Now, after weeks of therapy and countless sessions, Amelia felt a creeping sense of helplessness growing inside her.  Could she truly help this child regain his lost freedom? Would he ever be able to run and play again?  The storm raged on, both within Amelia's soul and outside, mirroring her own growing despair.
