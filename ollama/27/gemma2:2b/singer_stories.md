The air in the back room of "The Rusty Nail" hummed with a low, electric tension that only grew as Amelia's voice soared through the smoke-filled haze.  It wasn't the usual gritty bluesy drawl of the bar crowd; it was pure, unadulterated popstar energy - notes shimmering like spilled champagne in the dim lights. The stage seemed to shrink, each chord and note an echo of her heart on a million different levels at once. 

Her name, Amelia "Amy" Thorne, wasn't exactly household name yet.  But for years she'd honed her voice in dingy dive bars and forgotten clubs, dreaming bigger than the smoke-filled corners of her hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania.  Tonight, though, was a leap onto another stage altogether - The Grand Slam Showcase in New York City. 

As Amy finished her final note, a hush fell over the room. Even the bartender, a grizzled man named Earl with eyes that held more stories than the cracked mahogany bar top, seemed to hold his breath.  The lights above flickered back on, and a single spotlight landed directly on Amy’s face. She looked down at her hands, clutching a guitar strap that felt almost like an extension of herself, before meeting the expectant gaze of the audience.
