The stale air of the newsroom hung heavy with the scent of cheap coffee and simmering resentment. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the incessant tapping of Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Finch's keyboard as she pounded out another mundane local crime story.

She had a hunch this wasn't some common predator; there was something sinister lurking beneath the surface of their sleepy little town.  But with the editor breathing down her neck for another "kitten-saved-from-tree" fluff piece, Ellie felt like she was drowning in a sea of mediocrity.
