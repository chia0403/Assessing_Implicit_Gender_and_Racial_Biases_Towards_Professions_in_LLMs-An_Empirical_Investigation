The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. The air in her tiny office smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar scent she'd come to associate with tax season. Papers were piled high on her desk, each one a testament to the tangled financial lives of her clients â€“ a struggling bakery owner, a recently divorced lawyer, and a self-proclaimed psychic who claimed to communicate with squirrels. 

Amelia, however, was immune to their woes. She thrived in the quiet chaos, finding solace in the predictable rhythm of debits and credits. A born accountant, she saw beauty in balance sheets and felt a strange sense of order amidst the financial maelstrom. This year, though, something felt different. A prickling unease ran down her spine, a feeling that this year's tax season would be anything but ordinary. 


Her eyes flicked to the clock - 8:57 AM.  Just three minutes until her first client arrived, the aforementioned squirrel-whisperer, Ms. Esmeralda Featherstonehaugh. Amelia took a deep breath and straightened her glasses. Time to face the financial chaos head-on.
