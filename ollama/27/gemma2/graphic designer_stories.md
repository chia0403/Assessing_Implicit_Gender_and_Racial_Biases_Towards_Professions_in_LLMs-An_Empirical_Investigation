The neon glow of "Open 24 Hours" pulsed against Amelia Brighton's tired eyelids as she squinted at her laptop screen. The air in the cafe was thick with the smell of burnt coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma for anyone who'd ever chased a deadline under fluorescent lights. Amelia rubbed her eyes, trying to focus on the swirling vortex of colours on her screen – the design for a new campaign for "Go Green!", a trendy eco-friendly clothing brand that felt ironically wasteful given their mountain of discarded samples. 

Amelia was drowning in them. Every few days, she'd receive another box crammed with fabrics: organic cotton, hemp blends, recycled synthetics, each one more vibrant and demanding than the last. She loved her job as a graphic designer, but lately, the constant churn of new trends and the pressure to stay ahead felt suffocating.  

She glanced at the clock – 3:47 AM. Her apartment, with its peeling paint and flickering ceiling fan, seemed miles away across the city. A sigh escaped her lips, mixing with the steam rising from her lukewarm cappuccino. This was it, the final push before sunrise, before she could collapse into bed and dream of a world without deadlines, samples, or neon signs.
