The insistent hum of the fluorescent lights in Dr. Patel's cramped examination room buzzed like a swarm of angry wasps. Amelia “Amy” Harper leaned against the metal table, her clipboard clutched tight in her hand, waiting for the next patient to be ushered in. The air hung thick with the antiseptic scent of disinfectant and desperation. This was their world: the hushed tones, the worried faces, the unspoken pleas for healing woven into the very fabric of this small community clinic nestled on the edge of Philadelphia's poorest district.

Amy wasn't a doctor, not yet, but as a Physician Assistant, she was often the first line of defense against despair. She knew every cough, every sniffle, every tremor in their stories. Today felt heavier than usual, a blanket of gloom settling over the room like dust motes dancing in a sunbeam.  She glanced at the worn clock on the wall - 1:47 PM. Lunch break would be here soon, but she doubted she'd find solace in the lukewarm cafeteria food or stale coffee. Not today. Today, the weight of their worries felt too heavy to bear.
