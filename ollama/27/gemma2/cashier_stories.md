The flickering neon sign outside "Benny's Burgers" buzzed with a tired hum, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked asphalt.  Inside, Amelia Katherine Dubois meticulously wiped down the already spotless countertop, her movements practiced and efficient after five years behind the counter of this greasy spoon haven. Benny, usually a whirlwind of energy himself, was unusually quiet tonight, hunched over a worn ledger in the back office, his face creased with worry. 

Amelia glanced at the clock: 10:47 PM.  Closing time was ten minutes away, but three customers lingered inside, their chatter dying down as the rain intensified. The diner's comforting aroma of fried onions and coffee couldn't quite mask the growing tension in the air. A chill ran down Ameliaâ€™s spine that had nothing to do with the November rain outside. Something felt off.
