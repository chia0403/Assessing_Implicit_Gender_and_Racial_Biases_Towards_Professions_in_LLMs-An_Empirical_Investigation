Rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s office window, blurring the city lights into shimmering streaks of color. The rhythmic drumming mirrored the nervous tapping of her latest patient, Ethan Carter, who sat hunched in his chair, avoiding eye contact.  

Dr. Hawthorne, a seasoned counseling psychologist with a penchant for floral cardigans and calming scents, settled back in her leather armchair, observing him through half-lidded eyes. Her office was a haven of soft blues and greens, designed to foster tranquility – a stark contrast to the storm raging outside and the turmoil swirling within Ethan. The air hung heavy with unspoken anxieties, punctuated only by the hiss of the humidifier and the occasional crackle of the fireplace.

Ethan fidgeted with his watch, then finally met her gaze, his eyes clouded with worry. “I don’t even know where to begin,” he mumbled, his voice barely a whisper against the backdrop of the tempest. 


“There’s no right or wrong way to start, Ethan,” Dr. Hawthorne replied softly, her voice warm and reassuring. "Just tell me what's on your mind."
