The air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary in Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood's shop. It was a familiar fragrance, one that clung to his worn leather apron and the coarse hairs on his neck like a second skin. Sunlight, weak and watery through the grimy windowpanes, painted dust motes dancing in the air above the glistening steel counters. A symphony of chopping, thumping, and the hiss of sharpening blades filled the small space, punctuated by the occasional gruff bellow from Bart as he guided his cleaver through a plump leg of lamb.  

The shop itself was a relic of a bygone era, nestled in a forgotten corner of Old Town where cobblestone streets snaked between weather-beaten brick buildings. The "Blackwood Butcher," the faded sign above creaked slightly in the breeze, its once vibrant blue paint now peeling like sunburned skin. Inside, time seemed to flow differently. It was a world governed by tradition and the rhythm of the day - dawn brought the first deliveries, midday saw the rush of housewives and cooks, and evening offered a quiet hum as Bart meticulously cleaned his tools, ready for another day's cycle.  


Bart himself was a man forged from the very essence of this timeless place. He had weathered hands, calloused from years of wielding knives and hefting carcasses, eyes that crinkled at the corners when he smiled, and a voice that rumbled like distant thunder. He was known throughout Old Town for his quality cuts, honest prices, and gruff demeanor - a man who spoke little but let his work speak volumes.
