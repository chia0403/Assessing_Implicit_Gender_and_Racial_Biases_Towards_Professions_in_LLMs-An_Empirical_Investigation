The insistent chirping of his phone woke Elias Thorne from his dream, a surreal blend of Parisian pastries and Himalayan prayer flags. He swatted at it blindly, silencing the unwelcome intrusion before remembering where he was – sprawled on a worn leather sofa in his sun-drenched office overlooking the bustling New Orleans French Quarter. 

His travel agency, "Wanderlust & Whimsy," was anything but bustling. Elias, though brimming with passion for his profession, had yet to see his dream take flight. The quaint shop, tucked away on a cobblestone street lined with vibrant art galleries and bohemian boutiques, remained largely vacant, save for the occasional curious tourist peeking through the window at the antique globes and faded travel posters adorning its walls.  

Elias sighed, pushing himself up from the sofa and stretching his stiff limbs. He glanced at the clock - 7:00 am, a whole hour before the office officially opened. It was Tuesday, meaning another day of fielding calls from jaded couples seeking last-minute beach getaways and anxious families trying to navigate complex international itineraries. Elias yearned for something more – a chance to curate truly unique experiences, to help people discover hidden gems and forge unforgettable memories. He just needed the right client.  


The chime above the door announced his first visitor of the day, breaking Elias's reverie. It was an elderly woman, her face etched with lines that spoke of countless adventures, carrying a worn leather suitcase and a twinkle in her eye.
