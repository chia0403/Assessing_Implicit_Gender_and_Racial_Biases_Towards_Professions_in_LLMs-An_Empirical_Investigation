The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, competing with the faint hum of rain drumming on the awning outside. Inside "Haven Holistic", Amelia Thistlewood kneaded her fingers into the tight knot in Mrs. Peterson’s shoulders, the rhythmic movements echoing the steady patter of water.  Mrs. Peterson, a retired librarian with a penchant for floral print dresses and a perpetually furrowed brow, sighed contentedly as tension eased from her neck.

Amelia, her own auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, glanced at the clock: 5:47 pm. Just enough time to finish Mrs. Peterson’s session before the last client of the day walked in. The Haven was tucked away on a quiet side street in Asheville, North Carolina, nestled between an antique store and a cozy bookstore. It wasn't much, but it was Amelia's haven – a sanctuary where she could help others find solace in touch.
