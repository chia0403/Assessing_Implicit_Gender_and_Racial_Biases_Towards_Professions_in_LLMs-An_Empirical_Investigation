The dew-kissed grass clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick's boots like tiny emerald spiders as he began his morning rounds.  The air was crisp with the scent of pine and damp earth, tinged with the faintest hint of honeysuckle from Mrs. Periwinkle's unruly garden. He surveyed his domain: Oakhaven Manor, a sprawling Victorian mansion nestled in the heart of the Cotswolds. Its ivy-covered walls whispered tales of forgotten grandeur, its mullioned windows like watchful eyes gazing out over the rolling green hills. 

Bartholomew, however, saw no ghosts or secrets lurking within the manor's shadow. He saw only the intricate ballet of nature unfolding beneath his care â€“ the flitting of bluebells in the breeze, the silent climb of morning glories on their trellis, the symphony of birdsong that filled every corner of the sprawling grounds. It was a world he understood intimately, a world where he felt truly at peace. 


But today, something felt different.  The usual serenity was pierced by a low murmur emanating from the manor itself, a murmur Bartholomew couldn't quite place. He paused, listening intently, his trowel forgotten in the damp earth. It seemed to come from the locked conservatory, usually hushed and silent during these early hours. A shiver, unrelated to the morning chill, crawled down his spine.
