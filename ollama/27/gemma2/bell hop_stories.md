The air hung thick with the scent of stale perfume and forgotten dreams in the Grandview Hotel. Dust motes danced in the shaft of sunlight piercing through the cracked windowpane, illuminating Amelia "Millie" Rose's weary face.  She smoothed down her crisp white uniform jacket, feeling the weight of the brass name tag pinned to its lapel â€“ 'A. Rose, Bellhop'. Millie squinted at the telegram clutched in her sweaty hand, the words blurring before her eyes: 'Come home immediately. Father ill.' It was a plea she couldn't ignore, but leaving this crumbling monument to faded glamour felt like abandoning a part of herself.  She took a deep breath, steeling her resolve. Millie would return after fulfilling her duty, but for now, the Grandview held her captive, its echoing hallways whispering secrets and anxieties that mirrored her own. 


The Grandview Hotel itself was a relic of a bygone era, a sprawling Victorian behemoth perched precariously on a hill overlooking the bustling port city of Havenfall. Once a haven for artists and socialites, it now housed a motley crew: weary travelers, faded stars clinging to their last flicker of fame, and locals seeking solace in its forgotten grandeur.  Its ornate ballroom lay silent, dust-covered chandeliers casting long shadows on the decaying parquet floor, while the once vibrant dining hall was now a ghostly echo of lavish meals past.
