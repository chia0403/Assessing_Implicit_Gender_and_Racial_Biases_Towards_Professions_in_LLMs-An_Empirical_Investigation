The humid air hung heavy in Antoinette "Toni" Beaumont's salon, thick with the mingled scents of lavender shampoo and freshly-baked bread wafting from the bakery next door.  Light poured through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting warm squares on the plush red carpets. Toni surveyed her domain â€“ rows of gleaming white chairs, shelves stocked with rainbow-hued hair products, and a wall lined with framed certificates proclaiming her mastery of everything from balayage to braiding. It was Saturday morning, the busiest time at "Toni's Touch," and already clients were filtering in, eager for their weekly dose of pampering.  

But Toni wasn't focused on the usual symphony of blow dryers and chattering voices. Her gaze drifted towards the back door, where a stray wisp of smoke curled into the air, accompanied by the muffled thumping of a heavy object being dragged across the pavement. A shiver ran down her spine. Something was wrong.  


This wasn't just another regular Saturday morning at Toni's Touch.
