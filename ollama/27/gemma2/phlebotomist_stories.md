The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Nightingale's head like anxious bees, casting a sterile glow over the cramped waiting room.  She tapped her pen against a clipboard, the rhythmic click echoing in the near-silence punctuated only by the occasional cough or sniffle. It was always quieter on Tuesdays, which meant she had more time to daydream while the vein-hunters of General Hospital navigated their way through a sea of impatient patients. 

Elara wasn't hunting veins; she was harvesting them. Harvesting stories whispered in the rustling of gauze and the prickling of needles, stories spun from fear and anticipation, hope and resignation. Each drop of blood held a narrative, a symphony of life unfolding in its crimson current. She knew her job was mundane to most, but Elara found beauty in the ordinary, magic in the mundane. Today, she had a feeling this Tuesday would be particularly interesting.
