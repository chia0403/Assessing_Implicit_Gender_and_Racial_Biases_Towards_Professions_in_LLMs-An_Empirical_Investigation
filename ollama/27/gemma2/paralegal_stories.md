Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Amelia Grace Bennett's tiny apartment, blurring the already dreary cityscape outside. The rhythmic drumming was almost soothing, a counterpoint to the insistent buzzing of her phone. 

She glanced at the screen:  "Mr. Thornton - Urgent." A shiver ran down her spine. Mr. Thornton, a renowned defense attorney known for his aggressive tactics and even more aggressive clientele, rarely called before noon. And certainly never with an "urgent" request. Amelia was just settling into her third cup of lukewarm coffee, trying to decipher the labyrinthine legal jargon in the latest deposition she had to prepare. 

Amelia, a paralegal at Thornton & Associates, felt the weight of the phone pressing against her ear as she answered, "Amelia Bennett speaking."  Her apartment, a converted attic space in an aging building in Brooklyn's less glamorous sector, hummed with anticipation. The storm outside mirrored the brewing storm within. She had a feeling this call was about to upend her carefully curated routine and plunge her into another one of Mr. Thorntonâ€™s high-stakes legal battles.
