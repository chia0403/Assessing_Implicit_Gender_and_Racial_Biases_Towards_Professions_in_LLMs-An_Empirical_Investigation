The flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's cluttered writing desk, painting her manuscripts in shifting pools of orange light. Outside, London was alive with the muffled roar of traffic and the distant shouts of hawkers, but inside her cramped garret flat, silence reigned.

The deadline for her latest novel loomed like a ravenous beast, and her muse had apparently flown south for the winter. Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.

In one corner, a battered typewriter sat silent, its keys yearning for the tap-tap-tap of inspiration.
