The smell of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic whirring of an exercise bike and the muffled sobs coming from Room 3. Amelia "Amy" Rosewater sighed, pushing her stethoscope up her scrubs-covered chest. Another Monday morning at Sunshine Rehabilitation Center, another parade of broken bodies and bruised spirits.  

Sunshine wasn't your typical rehab facility – it specialized in trauma recovery, a world Amy had fallen into almost by accident after her own near-fatal car crash five years ago. Back then, the sterile white walls and whirring machines had felt like a prison, but now, they were a comforting haven where she helped others rebuild their lives, piece by broken piece.

Today's challenge was Mrs. Eleanor Hayes, a vibrant woman in her late sixties who had recently lost her husband to cancer and subsequently fallen down the stairs, fracturing her hip. Amy suspected grief played a larger role in Mrs. Hayes' reluctance to participate in therapy than the physical pain itself. As she knocked gently on Room 3’s door, Amy hoped today would be different. Maybe, just maybe, she could help Mrs. Hayes find a glimmer of sunshine again.
