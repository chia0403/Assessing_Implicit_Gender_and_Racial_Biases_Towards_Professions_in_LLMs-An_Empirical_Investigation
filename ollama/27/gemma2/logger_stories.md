The mist hung low over the Douglas firs, their towering trunks shrouded in an ethereal veil. Sunlight, weak and watery, struggled to pierce the dense canopy above. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and pine needles, a familiar perfume to Elias Blackwood, his weathered hands gripping the worn leather handle of his axe. 

Elias, calloused and sun-kissed, squinted at the horizon through the swirling mist. He could just make out the faint outline of Mount Rainier, its snow-capped peak piercing the grey expanse like a frozen beacon. Another day in the Gifford Pinchot National Forest, another day battling the ancient giants that defined his world. 


He hefted his axe onto his shoulder, the familiar weight comforting against his broad back. It was time to work. Time to wrestle with the forest, to leave his mark on the emerald tapestry before winter's grip tightened its hold.
