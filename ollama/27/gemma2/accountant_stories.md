The fluorescent lights of PricewaterhouseCooper's Chicago office hummed with the same monotonous drone as Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's thoughts. Spreadsheets swam before her eyes, each cell containing another digit in the endless equation of corporate profit.  

Eleanor, or Ellie as she was known by anyone who dared to call her anything other than "Ms. Hawthorne," felt a deep yearning for something more.  The sterile beige walls and the pungent scent of stale coffee did little to inspire. She longed for vibrant colors, the scent of fresh earth, and the sound of laughter echoing through open spaces, not confined to hushed cubicles. 

But Eleanor was trapped. Trapped by societal expectations, by her parents' dreams woven into her own DNA, by the seemingly inescapable weight of responsibility that came with a name like Beatrice Hawthorne. Tonight, however, felt different. A persistent itch beneath her skin, an unspoken promise in the air, whispered of change on the horizon. 


**Setting:** A high-rise office building in downtown Chicago, specifically the Chicago branch of PricewaterhouseCooper accounting firm. The year is 2023.
