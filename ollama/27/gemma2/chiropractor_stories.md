The scent of eucalyptus and peppermint hung heavy in the air, a soothing counterpoint to the persistent crackle of Dr. Amelia Blythe's adjusting table. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of her small practice, "Blythe Spine & Wellness," illuminating motes dancing in the warm air. Outside, the bustling heart of Asheville, North Carolina, hummed with Saturday morning activity, but inside, a quiet calm prevailed. 

Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose bun and her faded blue scrubs tucked into her trusty steel-toed clogs, listened patiently as Mr. Henderson, a retired schoolteacher with a perpetually pained back, recounted his latest bout of sciatica. His words were punctuated by the rhythmic creaking of the old Victorian house that housed her practice, a comforting backdrop to Amelia's work.  


The setting sun cast long shadows across the waiting room, turning the worn leather armchairs into pools of gold and amber. A stray ray illuminated a framed picture on the wall – Amelia, smiling broadly in her white coat, beside her grandfather, Dr. Robert Blythe, the renowned chiropractor who had instilled in her a passion for helping people find relief through natural means. The weight of his legacy, and her own responsibility to uphold it, settled comfortably on Amelia’s shoulders as she prepared to guide Mr. Henderson through another round of adjustments.
