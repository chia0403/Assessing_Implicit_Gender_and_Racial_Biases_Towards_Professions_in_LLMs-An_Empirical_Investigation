The scent of crayons, hand sanitizer, and stale Cheerios hung thick in the air of the Sunshine Daycare Center's pre-K classroom. A rainbow mural adorned one wall, perpetually smudged with tiny fingers. The clock ticked loudly, a metronome marking the ever-ticking seconds until 3:00 PM when the floodgates would open and a gaggle of rambunctious four and five-year-olds would erupt from their carefully constructed play worlds to reclaim their parents.  

Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne meticulously rearranged blocks into a haphazard tower, her brow furrowed in concentration. The name "Beatrice" was a tongue twister even for its owner, often shortened to Bea by the children who adored her gentle demeanor and penchant for silly songs about dinosaurs and vegetables. Today, however, Amelia's usual sunny disposition seemed clouded. A knot of worry tightened in her stomach as she glanced at the clock again.  

Her phone buzzed in her pocket, vibrating against her hip. It was a text from Mrs. Peterson, whose five-year-old son, Liam, had been particularly withdrawn lately. The message simply read: "Liam hasn't been himself lately. Could you keep an eye on him today?" 


Amelia sighed. She knew something was amiss with Liam. He barely spoke, his once bright eyes dulled, and his laughter seemed to have vanished entirely.  What could be weighing so heavily on the usually effervescent little boy? As the first whispers of "Mommy" and "Daddy" drifted from the hallway, Amelia's heart sank. She knew she needed answers. And quickly.
