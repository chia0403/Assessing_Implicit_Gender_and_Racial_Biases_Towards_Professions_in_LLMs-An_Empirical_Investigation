The aroma of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of cinnamon from Amelia Grace Thorne's homemade granola bars. She sighed, pulling a charcoal-black slice from the toaster and tossing it into the bin.  Another casualty in her ongoing battle against kitchen appliances that seemed determined to thwart her every attempt at a healthy breakfast.

Amelia’s office, nestled above a bustling bakery in Brooklyn's charming Carroll Gardens neighborhood, was bathed in the warm glow of morning sunlight streaming through its large windows. Outside, the rhythmic clatter of coffee cups and chatter from the street below painted a vibrant backdrop for Amelia's quiet morning ritual. She adjusted her spectacles, ran a hand through her unruly auburn curls, and took a bite of one of her granola bars – thankfully unscathed by toaster-induced disaster. 

Today was a particularly busy day at "Nourish & Thrive," her dietician practice dedicated to helping people build healthy relationships with food. Amelia loved her work; she thrived on the challenge of guiding clients towards balanced lifestyles, celebrating small victories and witnessing their transformations. But today, a particular case weighed heavily on her mind: the enigmatic Mrs. Eleanor Dubois, who had requested a consultation after weeks of struggling with debilitating fatigue. 


Amelia glanced at the calendar, marking down Mrs. Dubois' appointment. A wave of curiosity washed over her. She couldn’t shake the feeling that this wasn't just another case; there was something about Mrs. Dubois that hinted at a deeper story, waiting to be uncovered beneath the surface.
