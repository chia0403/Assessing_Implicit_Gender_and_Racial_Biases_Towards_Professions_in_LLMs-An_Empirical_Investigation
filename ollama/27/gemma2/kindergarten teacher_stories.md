The scent of crayons and disinfectant hung thick in the air, a comforting blend familiar to Miss Amelia Beatrice Harper. Outside, autumn leaves swirled in a flurry of burnt orange and crimson, tapping impatiently against the windows of her brightly colored kindergarten classroom at Maplewood Elementary. Inside, chaos reigned. 

Amelia surveyed the scene with a practiced eye â€“ a tower of blocks teetering precariously, a half-eaten apple core abandoned on a table covered in glitter glue, and tiny voices buzzing like a hive of excited bees. It was show-and-tell day, and six-year-old imaginations were running wild. Today's topic: "Something that makes you happy." 


Amelia smiled, feeling the familiar warmth bloom in her chest. Despite the occasional tantrum, the overwhelming mess, and the relentless questions about why the sky is blue, this was where she belonged. This room, with its mismatched chairs and hand-painted murals of friendly dinosaurs, was her haven, and these rambunctious, curious children were her joy.
