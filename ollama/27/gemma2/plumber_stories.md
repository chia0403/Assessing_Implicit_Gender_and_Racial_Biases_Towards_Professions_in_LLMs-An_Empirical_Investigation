The stench hit Felix Bartholomew "Fixit" Finch before he even turned the corner onto Maple Street. It wasn't the usual, almost comforting aroma of sewage that often permeated his world as a plumber. This was something else, something sour and sickly sweet. 

He squinted through the afternoon haze, the August sun beating down on his sweat-stained brow. Maple Street, usually bustling with retirees gossiping on their porch swings and kids chasing squirrels in the manicured lawns, was eerily quiet. A single, wavering plume of black smoke rose from the Victorian house at number 13, its white paint peeling like sunburnt skin. A sign taped to the front door read "Out of Order - Please do not enter."

Fixit sighed. This wasn't good. He pulled his worn baseball cap lower over his eyes, adjusting the strap on his tool belt with a practiced hand. Whatever was brewing at number 13, it wasn't going to fix itself. And Fixit Bartholomew "Fixit" Finch didn't shy away from a challenge, especially one that smelled like something rotten in Denmark.
