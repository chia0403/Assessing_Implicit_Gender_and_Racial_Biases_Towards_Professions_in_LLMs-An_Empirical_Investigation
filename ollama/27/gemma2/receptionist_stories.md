The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda Bellweather's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees, their buzzing a constant soundtrack to the monotony of her day.  She tapped away at the keyboard, the click-clack echoing in the sterile silence of Dr. Finchley's office. 

The waiting room was deserted, save for a lone potted fern drooping sadly in the corner and a stack of dog-eared magazines that hadn't seen fresh ink since the dawn of the internet. The walls were adorned with framed diplomas and certificates, each one a testament to Dr. Finchley's expertise in...well, Esmeralda wasn't entirely sure what he specialized in. All she knew was that he treated anxieties, phobias, and the occasional existential dread.  

Esmeralda longed for something more stimulating than filing insurance claims and scheduling appointments. A life beyond the confines of this beige-walled purgatory, where the only excitement came from the occasional stray cat sneaking through the unlocked back door. But for now, she was content to be a silent sentinel, a guardian of Dr. Finchley's sanity, one appointment at a time.
