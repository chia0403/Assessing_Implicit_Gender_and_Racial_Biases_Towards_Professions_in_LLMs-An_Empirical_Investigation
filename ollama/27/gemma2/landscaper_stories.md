The morning mist clung to Amelia Thistlewick's gardening boots like a shy child clinging to its mother's skirt.  Sunlight was just beginning to pierce through the thick blanket of fog that hung over Willow Creek, casting an ethereal glow on the dew-laden grass and rose bushes in her care. A symphony of birdsong filled the air, punctuated by the occasional clang of Amelia's tools as she pruned a particularly unruly hydrangea bush. 

Willow Creek was a quaint village nestled in the rolling hills of Vermont, where time seemed to move at a slower pace, measured by the blooming of lilac bushes and the falling of crimson leaves.  Amelia Thistlewick, known affectionately as "Thistle" by most villagers, had been tending their gardens for over twenty years, her knowledge of flora rivaled only by her love for the community she called home. 


Today, however, something felt different.  A nervous fluttering in her stomach couldn't be dismissed as early morning jitters. This wasn't just any day - it was the day Mrs. Henderson, the village's most formidable resident and notorious gardening critic, was hosting a tea party for the annual Willow Creek Garden Club competition.
