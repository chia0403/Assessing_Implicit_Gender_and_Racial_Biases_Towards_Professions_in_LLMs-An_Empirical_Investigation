The acrid smell of jet fuel lingered in Amelia Claire Beaumont's nostrils even after she'd stepped out of the cockpit and onto the tarmac.  Her leather flight jacket snapped shut against the biting wind whipping across the runway at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas. A neon-streaked, glittering skyline pulsed in the distance, a stark contrast to the dusty expanse of the Nevada desert stretching behind her. 

Amelia adjusted her aviator sunglasses, shielding her eyes from the glare of the setting sun painting the sky in fiery hues. The air crackled with the energy of a city never asleep, but Amelia felt strangely detached.  She was used to the solitude of the sky, the quiet hum of engines and the vast emptiness that surrounded her during flight. The frenetic pulse of Las Vegas always left her feeling like an alien observer.

Tonight, though, she couldn't afford to be detached. This wasn't just another routine cargo run. Tonight, Amelia carried a secret - a small, unmarked package tucked away in the belly of her Cessna Citation, its contents more valuable than gold. And she was racing against time, the clock ticking down on an intricate and dangerous plan that could change everything.
