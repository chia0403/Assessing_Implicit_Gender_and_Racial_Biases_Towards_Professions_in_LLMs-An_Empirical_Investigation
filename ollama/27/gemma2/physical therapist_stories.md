The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne like a damp towel as she stepped out of her car.  Palm trees swayed lazily in the breeze, their fronds rustling against each other like whispered secrets. The scent of salt and sunscreen hung heavy, mingling with the faint smell of grilling burgers from the beachside restaurant across the street. Amy tugged at her scrubs, feeling a bead of sweat trickle down her temple. 

She was used to the heat in Savannah, but this particular July day felt particularly oppressive.  The clinic she worked at, "Coastal Rehab," was tucked away on a quiet side street, its faded blue paint and peeling welcome sign hinting at better days. Inside, the air conditioning provided a blessed reprieve from the stifling heat, but Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. 


It wasn't just the weather; there was an unease in the usually calm office. The receptionist, normally bubbly and full of gossip, sat with her shoulders hunched, a worried frown etched on her face. And when Amy greeted Dr. Lee, he seemed distracted, his usual cheerful demeanor replaced by a grim silence. 

Amy knew something was wrong. She just didn't know what.  And as she started her day, treating patients recovering from everything from knee surgery to broken ankles, that sense of foreboding only intensified. It felt like the tide was turning, bringing with it a storm she couldn't yet see on the horizon.
