The air in Genevieve Eloise Dubois' workshop hung thick with the scent of lavender sachet and fine linen. Sunbeams, fractured by the rainbow hues of silk hanging from the ceiling, danced across the cluttered worktable. A half-finished bodice lay on display, its intricate lace appliqu√© mirroring the delicate network of veins in Genevieve's own hand as she delicately stitched. 

Genevieve was a woman woven from her craft. Every crease in her forehead spoke of late nights spent hunched over patterns, every calloused fingertip a testament to years spent coaxing fabrics into life. Her workshop, tucked away on a cobblestone street nestled between the grand avenues and bustling markets of Paris, was her sanctuary - a haven where dreams were sewn and stories whispered through needle and thread. 


But today, even the soft murmur of Parisian life couldn't drown out the tremor in Genevieve's heart. The news had spread like wildfire through the city -  a royal ball was to be held at the Palace of Versailles, an event shrouded in secrecy and anticipation. And with it came a singular opportunity: the chance for Genevieve to showcase her talent on the grandest stage imaginable.
