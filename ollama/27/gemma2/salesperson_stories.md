The humid Atlanta air clung to Amelia "Amy" Grace Hawthorne like a second skin as she stepped out of her beat-up Ford Focus.  Sweat prickled at the nape of her neck despite the fact that she'd already splashed on a healthy dose of antiperspirant. She adjusted the strap of her canvas tote bag, the one with the faded image of a martini glass and the inscription "Sip Happens." It held more than just her lunch - today was a big day for Amy. This sales pitch at Suncoast Properties, a luxury condo complex perched precariously on the edge of the city's skyline, could be her ticket out of her cramped apartment and into something... nicer.  

The glass towers of Suncoast glittered under the relentless July sun, a shimmering mirage against the azure sky. Amy took a deep breath, trying to quell the flutter in her chest. This wasn’t just any sales pitch – it was for a penthouse suite with a panoramic view of the city, a balcony big enough for a yoga session, and amenities that would make a king jealous. It was a dream, both for her potential client and for Amy herself.  She had to nail this one.
