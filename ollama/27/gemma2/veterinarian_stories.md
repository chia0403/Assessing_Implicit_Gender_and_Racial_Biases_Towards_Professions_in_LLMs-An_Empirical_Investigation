The early morning mist clung to the rolling hills surrounding Maple Creek, obscuring the familiar patchwork of farmland that lay beyond Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's cozy clinic. Inside, the air hummed with the quiet anticipation of a busy day. Ellie, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun and her scrubs smelling faintly of disinfectant and hay, double-checked the schedule on her whiteboard: two routine puppy checkups, a grumpy old sheepdog named Gus for his annual examination, and then…the mystery case. A frantic call the previous evening from a local farmer had left Ellie with more questions than answers – a flock of chickens behaving strangely, refusing to lay eggs, and exhibiting what the farmer described as "a peculiar twitching."

Ellie sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. This was going to be an interesting day.
