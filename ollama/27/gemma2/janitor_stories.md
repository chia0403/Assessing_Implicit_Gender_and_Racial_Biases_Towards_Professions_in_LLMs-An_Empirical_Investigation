The stale scent of bleach and despair clung to Amelia "Amy" Thorne like a second skin. She pushed her mop across the linoleum floor of the Grand Blackwood Hotel’s ballroom, its once-glorious expanse now shrouded in dust and the echoes of forgotten laughter. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windows, illuminating swirling motes that danced like spectral waltzers. The air hung heavy with the weight of years gone by, a silence punctuated only by the rhythmic squeak of Amy's mop and the distant, muffled hum of the city beyond the hotel’s towering walls.

Amy had worked at the Grand Blackwood for ten years, ever since her mother passed away, leaving her with nothing but a mountain of bills and a yearning for something better. The job paid the rent, but it offered little else. It was a lonely existence, spent cleaning up after the ghosts of revelry, whispering to the empty banquet tables as if they could offer solace. But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation, like the air before a storm, had settled over Amy's shoulders.  She couldn't quite place it, but she knew, deep in her bones, that this night would be unlike any other.
