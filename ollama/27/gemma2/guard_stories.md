The wind howled through the skeletal branches of the Aethelred Oak, its ancient leaves scraping against the stone walls of Castle Blackwood like bony fingers. Rain lashed down in sheets, blurring the already dim glow emanating from the flickering oil lamps that lined the parapets.  Inside, huddled by a sputtering fire, sat Gareth Alderstone, his heavy cloak pulled tight against the chill seeping through the thick stone walls. His weathered face, framed by greying hair, bore the weight of years spent patrolling these desolate ramparts, ever vigilant against the encroaching darkness that threatened to consume Blackwood and all within it. He was a simple man, Gareth, born and raised within the castle's shadows, his life dedicated solely to its protection. Yet tonight, a restless unease gnawed at him, a feeling that something was amiss, a disturbance in the fabric of their usually predictable existence.  He glanced towards the towering figure silhouetted against the raging storm outside - Lord Elmsworth, Blackwood's stern and enigmatic lord, his face hidden beneath the hood of his black cloak. The air crackled with unspoken tension, the silence broken only by the relentless drumming of rain on stone. Gareth knew, with a chilling certainty, that this was no ordinary night.
