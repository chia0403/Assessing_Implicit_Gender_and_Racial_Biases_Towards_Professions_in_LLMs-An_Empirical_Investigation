The air in "Nails of Distinction" always smelled like lavender and dreams.  Eleanor Vivienne Beauregard, known affectionately to her clientele as Ellie B, worked diligently on Mrs. Kensington's nails. It was Wednesday afternoon, a notoriously busy time at the salon nestled in the heart of Greenwich Village. 

Rain lashed against the large, arched windows, blurring the vibrant street scene into streaks of color. Inside, a symphony of manicured chatter filled the air – gossip exchanged over crimson lipsticks and shimmering polishes. Ellie B, however, was immune to the cacophony.  With practiced precision, she applied a thin coat of pearly white lacquer, listening intently as Mrs. Kensington bemoaned her son's latest dating misadventures. 

The rhythmic tapping of brushes against nails provided a calming counterpoint to the city's frenetic energy. Ellie B found solace in this routine – the familiar scent of polish remover, the clinking of tiny silver tools, and the soft murmur of stories shared between strangers under her watchful eye.  This was her sanctuary, a space where dreams were polished, anxieties filed away, and secrets whispered over perfectly manicured tips. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Ellie B's spine, a feeling that couldn't be explained by the insistent drizzle outside or Mrs. Kensington's overly dramatic tale of woe.
