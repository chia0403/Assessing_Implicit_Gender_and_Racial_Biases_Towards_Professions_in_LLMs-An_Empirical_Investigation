The midday sun beat down on Elias Montgomery's neck, turning his sweat-dampened collar into a soggy band around his skin. He wiped at it with the back of his hand, leaving streaks across his dirt-caked face. A steady hum vibrated through him, a symphony of diesel engines and the whirring blades of the asphalt paver as they laid down a new layer on Highway 61.  Elias squinted at the shimmering heat rising from the freshly laid tarmac, a mirage dancing in his vision. This stretch of highway snaked its way through the heart of Oklahoma, a ribbon of black asphalt cutting through fields of golden wheat that stretched to the horizon, seemingly endless under the unforgiving summer sky. It was monotonous work, but Elias found a strange solace in it – the rhythmic clang of tools, the steady progress of the machines, the feeling of contributing to something larger than himself. He was just one small cog in the vast machinery that kept America moving. 


Today, however, the monotony was broken by the arrival of a mysterious stranger who had pulled off the road onto the soft shoulder, his beat-up pickup truck kicking up dust devils as it came to a stop. Elias watched him from across the construction site, curiosity prickling at the back of his neck.  This wasn't the usual sight – lost tourists or curious onlookers were rare in this desolate stretch of highway.
