The greasy air hung thick in Zeke 'Greasemonkey' McTavish’s garage like a second skin. The scent mingled with engine oil, burnt rubber, and the faint sweetness of his grandma's apple pie cooling on the windowsill – an unlikely but comforting combination. Outside, the Montana sky was bruised purple and orange, the remnants of a fierce summer storm just passing. Zeke wiped his brow, leaving streaks across his already grime-covered face. He squinted at the engine before him, a battered Ford F-150 with more rust than paint. 

The truck belonged to Maggie O'Malley, the fiery owner of the local diner, and it had coughed its last breath two hours ago, stranding her on the dusty highway outside town. Zeke knew she was counting on that truck for her deliveries, and he hated letting anyone down. He took a deep breath, steeling himself. This engine wasn't just about fixing a broken machine; it was about keeping Maggie's livelihood – and her temper – intact. 


He grabbed his toolkit and got to work.
