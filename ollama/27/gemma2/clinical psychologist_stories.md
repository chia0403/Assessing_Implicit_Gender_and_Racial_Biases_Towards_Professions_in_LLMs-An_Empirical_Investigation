The aroma of jasmine tea hung heavy in Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne's office, a subtle attempt to soothe the anxieties that always seemed to cling to her patients like cobwebs. The late afternoon sun slanted through the stained-glass window, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the worn Persian rug beneath Amelia’s feet. Outside, the city of Seattle thrummed with its usual symphony of honking horns and distant sirens, a constant backdrop to the quiet chaos within her walls.  

Amelia sat perched on the edge of her desk, hands clasped in front of her, her gaze fixed on the man across from her. His name was Daniel, and he was young – barely out of his twenties – with haunted eyes that betrayed a weariness beyond his years. He fidgeted nervously, twisting a silver ring around his finger, as if it were his only lifeline to normalcy.  He was the third patient that afternoon, each one bearing the weight of unseen burdens, their stories woven into the fabric of the city’s tapestry – a city where dreams soared and shattered in equal measure. 


Amelia took a deep breath, willing herself to be present, to offer Daniel the safe space he so desperately needed. "Tell me," she began, her voice gentle yet firm, "what brings you here today?"
