The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the instruments laid out on the tray.  Lavender disinfectant clung to the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang that always lingered in Dr. Feldman's office. Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her mask, the familiar weight settling comfortably around her ears. She glanced at the clock - 7:58 AM. Another Tuesday morning had begun, and Amy was ready.  Ready for the chatter of nervous patients, the scrape of scalers against enamel, the satisfying clinking of instruments as she packed them away. Ready for the quiet predictability of her routine, a routine that was suddenly about to be disrupted.

The bustling dental office was nestled in the heart of Maplewood, a sleepy suburb where most residents knew their neighbors and gossip traveled faster than a flu shot. Amy had worked here for five years, becoming something of a local fixture herself. Her patients trusted her gentle touch, her calming demeanor, and her uncanny ability to distract even the most anxious with witty banter about the latest reality TV drama.  


But today was different. Today, Dr. Feldman wouldn't be seeing his usual clientele. He was attending a prestigious dental conference in Chicago, leaving Amy to manage the office solo. A knot of unease tightened in Amy’s stomach. She hadn’t dealt with patients alone before, not since she started working here fresh out of hygiene school.  What if something went wrong? What if a patient needed more than just a routine cleaning? 


A sharp rap on the door broke her thoughts. It was Mrs. Peterson, Amy's first appointment of the day, smiling brightly with her usual enthusiasm for brushing away plaque. 

"Good morning, Amy!" Mrs. Peterson chirped. "Ready to make my teeth sparkle?"  Amy forced a smile back, trying to ignore the anxious fluttering in her chest. This was just another Tuesday, after all. She could handle it. Right?
