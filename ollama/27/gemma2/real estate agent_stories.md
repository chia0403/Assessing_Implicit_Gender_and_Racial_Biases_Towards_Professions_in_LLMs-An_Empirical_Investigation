The humid Florida air clung to Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Carter like a damp towel as she squinted at the overgrown lawn of the dilapidated Victorian on Coral Gables Drive. Palm fronds swayed languidly in the breeze, casting dancing shadows across the peeling paint and chipped porch railing. A "For Sale" sign, faded and lopsided, leaned precariously against the cracked foundation. This wasn't exactly the kind of property Amy usually dealt with - sleek condos overlooking Biscayne Bay were more her speed. 

But this one was different. It was a fixer-upper, steeped in stories whispered by the overgrown garden and the mournful creak of the rusted swing set on the back porch.  It held a certain allure, a promise of something hidden beneath layers of neglect waiting to be unearthed. And Amy, despite her preference for modern minimalism, couldn't help but feel drawn to its melancholic beauty.
