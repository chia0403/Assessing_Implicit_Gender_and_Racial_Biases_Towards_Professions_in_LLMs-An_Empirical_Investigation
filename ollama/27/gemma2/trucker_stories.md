The greasy spoon diner buzzed with the tired energy of early morning truckers.  Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating swirling motes of cigarette smoke and coffee steam. A grimy Formica counter groaned under the weight of overflowing sugar dispensers and chipped mugs. At a corner booth, Amelia "Amy" Rose Thornton hunched over a lukewarm cup of black coffee, her calloused fingers tracing the worn leather of her trucker hat. The aroma of bacon and day-old fryer oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of diesel that clung to Amy's threadbare overalls. Outside, a chorus of rumbling engines punctuated the quiet chirping of birds â€“ a symphony of the open road beckoning.  Amy knew it was time to hit the highway, another eighteen wheels humming down a lonely stretch of asphalt, another load delivered, another town crossed off the map. 


This time, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine, whispering that this haul might be more than just another stop on a familiar route.  She took a long gulp of her coffee, trying to shake off the feeling. She'd been driving for twenty years, hauling everything from furniture to frozen chickens, and she wasn't about to let some nameless premonition slow her down.
