The scent of lilies and lavender clung to Eloise Amelia Beaumont like a second skin, a subtle but unmistakable reminder of her profession. She inhaled deeply as she stepped into the dusty, cavernous hall, sunlight filtering through grimy windows onto faded floral wallpaper peeling at the edges. The mansion, once a testament to grandeur, now sagged under years of neglect, its silence broken only by the creak of floorboards beneath Eloise's polished leather boots. 

It was far from the sleek, minimalist spaces she usually inhabited, but this sprawling Victorian belonged to Mrs. Hawthorne, a woman with stories etched into her weathered face and a twinkle in her faded blue eyes that reminded Eloise of a long-forgotten magic.  Eloise had been summoned to breathe life back into the house, not just cosmetically, but spiritually. To resurrect its lost soul, piece by antique piece, color by vibrant hue. This wouldn't be about aesthetics alone; this was a restoration of memories. 


This is the start of Eloise Amelia Beaumontâ€™s newest challenge: saving not just a house, but a woman's history.
