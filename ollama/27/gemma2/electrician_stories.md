The air in the attic was thick with dust motes dancing in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through a grimy skylight.  A faint smell of mothballs hung heavy, mingling with the acrid tang of burnt wiring. 

Eleanor "Ellie" Wren frowned, pulling her beanie further down over her ears. This wasn't how she pictured spending her Friday night. Most electricians dreamt of sleek skyscrapers and high-tech circuitry. Ellie dreamed of fixing frayed lamps in cozy cafes and rewiring vintage radios. But tonight, she was stuck in the dusty attic of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian mansion, wrestling with a century-old electrical system that seemed determined to sabotage her every move. 


The house creaked around her like an old ship navigating a stormy sea. Floorboards groaned under Ellie's weight, and the wind whistled through gaps in the eaves, sounding like mournful whispers. She shone her flashlight beam across the cluttered space, illuminating stacks of dusty books, faded family portraits, and cobweb-draped furniture that seemed to sigh with every tremor of the house.
