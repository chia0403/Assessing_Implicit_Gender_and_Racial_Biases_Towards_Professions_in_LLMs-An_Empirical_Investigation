The Arizona sun beat down on Elias Javier Rodriguez’s back like a blacksmith’s hammer. Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn steel beam. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh glare reflecting off the unfinished concrete skeleton of what would soon be Phoenix's newest skyscraper. 

Elias, a wiry man built more for speed than strength, grunted as he levered the beam into place, his muscles screaming in protest. He wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, leaving a streak of grime across his tanned skin. The air was thick with the scent of burnt metal and diesel fuel, a familiar aroma that permeated every corner of this chaotic construction site.  


This wasn't just another job for Elias; it was a chance to rebuild his life after the accident that had left him sidelined for months. Every clang of metal, every whirring drill, was a victory against the fear and uncertainty that had gripped him in the aftermath.
