The polished brass gleamed under the dim lights of the lobby, reflecting the anxieties etched on the face of Eloise Beaumont, head concierge of The Grand Meridian Hotel. A flurry of guests swirled around her, each with their own urgent whispers and requests. 

The Grand Meridian was a monument to opulence, its history whispered in the weight of antique chandeliers, the hushed rustle of silk curtains, and the faint scent of aged leather that clung to the worn velvet armchairs in the lobby. Built on the edge of the glittering city, its grand fa√ßade overlooked the bustling harbor, promising a vista of shimmering water and distant lights. 

But tonight, Eloise felt the usual magic of the place begin to fade. A chill had settled over The Grand Meridian, one that went beyond the crisp autumn air seeping through the ornate doorways. It was a palpable unease, a feeling that something unseen and unwelcome lurked beneath the surface of this opulent world she knew so well.  


Eloise straightened her crisp black uniform, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. She had faced countless demanding guests and unexpected emergencies during her time here, but this night felt different. A storm was brewing, both outside and within the walls of The Grand Meridian, and Eloise knew she would be caught right in its path.
