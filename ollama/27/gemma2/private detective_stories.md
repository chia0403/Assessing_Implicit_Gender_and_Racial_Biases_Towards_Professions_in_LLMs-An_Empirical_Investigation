The rain hammered against the grimy windows of Rex "Red" Callahan's office, each drop like a tiny fist pounding on his already frayed nerves. The air was thick with the smell of stale coffee, cheap cigarettes, and regret â€“ a scent that had become as familiar to Red as his own skin. His office, located in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, was less a beacon of hope for the downtrodden and more a testament to their desperation.

Red sat slumped behind his desk, staring at a photograph depicting a beautiful woman with auburn hair cascading down her back like a waterfall. Her emerald green eyes seemed to pierce through the years, pleading for answers even in death.  This was Claire Delacroix, socialite and philanthropist, found lifeless in her opulent mansion just two days ago. The police ruled it a suicide, but something about the case gnawed at Red, a discordant note in the symphony of grief. He could sense there was more to this story than met the eye, a darkness lurking beneath the gilded surface of New Orleans high society.


And he was determined to unearth it.
