Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" karaoke bar across the street. The flickering red and blue lights painted grotesque shadows on Amelia Cartwright's tired face. Papers spilled across her cramped desk, illuminated by a single, overworked lamp. Legal jargon swam before her eyes: "habeas corpus," "voir dire," "mens rea." It was 11:37 pm, and Amelia was knee-deep in the case files for Mr. Chen, a small shopkeeper facing deportation for a misunderstanding with his immigration paperwork. 

Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples. She loved being a paralegal, the thrill of uncovering crucial details, building a case brick by legal brick. But sometimes, the weight of injustice felt crushing. Amelia's boss, the notoriously gruff Mr. Henderson, had piled this case on her desk two days ago with a curt "make it happen." He hadn't seemed to notice the exhaustion etched into her face or the fact that she hadn't slept properly in 48 hours.
