Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the neon glow of the liquor store across the street flickered intermittently, casting an eerie green light that danced across the peeling paint on her desk. It was another Wednesday night in South Central LA, and Eleanor was already drowning in a sea of paperwork.

She stared at the file open before her: "Javier Rodriguez, 21, charged with petty theft." The photo attached showed a young man with haunted eyes and a defiant jawline â€“ someone who'd seen too much for his age. Javier was just one of her thirty-odd cases, each story woven into the tapestry of poverty, addiction, and broken promises that defined this neighborhood. Tonight, Eleanor felt the weight of it all pressing down on her, threatening to suffocate her with its despair.
