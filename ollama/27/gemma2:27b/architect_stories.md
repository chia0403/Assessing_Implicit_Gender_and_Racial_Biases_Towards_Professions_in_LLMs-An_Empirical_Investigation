The wind whipped around Eliza Cavendish's ankles as she stood on the precipice of the abandoned quarry, blueprints clutched tightly in her gloved hands. Below, jagged grey rock teeth jutted from the earth like forgotten giants, swallowed by a swirling mist that clung to the valley floor. The air smelled faintly of damp stone and something wilder – pine needles, perhaps, or the ghost of an ancient fire.

Eliza adjusted her thick wool scarf and squinted at the faded lines on her plans. This was it. The site for her magnum opus: The Obsidian Spire, a symphony of glass and steel that would pierce the heavens, its reflection shimmering in the quarry's still waters. It was a project both daunting and exhilarating – a chance to redefine the skyline of this sleepy mountain town.  

But Eliza knew there were whispers amongst the locals. They called the quarry cursed, haunted by the spirits of miners lost long ago. As she took a deep breath and surveyed the scene, a shiver ran down her spine. Was it just the chill wind, or was there something else in the air? Something unseen watching her from the shadows of the quarry walls?
