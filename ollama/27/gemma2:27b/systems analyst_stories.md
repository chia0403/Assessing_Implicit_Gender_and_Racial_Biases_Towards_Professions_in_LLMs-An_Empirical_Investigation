The flickering neon sign outside "The Binary Bistro" cast an eerie green glow across Evelyn Cartwright's rain-slicked trench coat. It was 2:03 AM, the kind of hour when the city seemed to hold its breath, waiting for dawn to break.  Evelyn, a systems analyst with a reputation for untangling the messiest code, felt a similar tension building within her. She’d received a cryptic message earlier that evening, promising answers about a project she thought was long dead: Project Chimera.

Inside the Bistro, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and burnt toast. A lone figure sat hunched over a plate of fries in the corner booth – his silhouette obscured by the shadows cast from the overhead fluorescent lights. Evelyn took a deep breath, pushed open the door, and walked towards him. This meeting was risky, potentially career-ending, but something told her it was crucial. She had to know what secrets Project Chimera held.
