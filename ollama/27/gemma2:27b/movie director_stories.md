The humid air hung heavy in the New Orleans alleyway, thick with the scent of jasmine and stale beignets. Above, wrought iron balconies groaned under the weight of bougainvillea, casting dappled shadows on the cracked cobblestones.  Edgar Bartholomew Finch IV, a man who wore fedoras like armor against the world's relentless mediocrity, adjusted his spectacles and squinted at the scene before him.

It was supposed to be a magical realism tableau vivant, capturing the ethereal essence of New Orleans after dark. Instead, it looked like a rejected Cirque du Soleil act had wandered into a dumpster fire.  

"Alright, darlings!" Edgar's voice boomed across the alleyway, sharp and precise like a well-honed blade. "Let's try this again. Remember, we're channeling the spirit of Marie Laveau, not your drunken Uncle Ernie after one too many Hurricanes."
