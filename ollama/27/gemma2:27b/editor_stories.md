The insistent chirp of Elara Thorne's antique desk phone pierced through the quiet hum of her Brooklyn brownstone apartment. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight slanting through the windowpanes, illuminating the stacks of manuscripts piled precariously on her writing desk. Elara sighed, setting down her red pen and reaching for the receiver. "Thorne Literary, Elara speaking," she said, her voice weary but professional.

She braced herself for another frantic author, desperate for feedback or plagued by writer's block. But this time, the voice on the other end was different â€“ deep, measured, with a hint of an accent she couldn't place. "Ms. Thorne? This is Alistair Davenport," the man said. "I believe you have something that belongs to me."

Elara's pulse quickened. What could a Mr. Davenport possibly want from her? She was known for her sharp eye and ruthless editing, but not for harboring lost treasures.  "What are you referring to, Mr. Davenport?" she asked cautiously, her curiosity piqued.
