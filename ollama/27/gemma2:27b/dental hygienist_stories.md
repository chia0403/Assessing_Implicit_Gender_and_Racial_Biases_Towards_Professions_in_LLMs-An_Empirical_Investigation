The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Montgomery's head, their sterile glow reflecting off the gleaming stainless steel instruments laid out on her tray. The faint scent of mint toothpaste mingled with antiseptic lingered in the air, a familiar comfort in the otherwise unnerving quiet of Dr. Chen's office. Eloise gripped the scaler, its cool metal reassuring against her palm. Today was shaping up to be one of those days where every patient seemed to have a story – or at least a toothache – that needed telling.

Her first appointment, Mrs. Henderson, was already settled in the dental chair, nervously chewing on her lip and avoiding Eloise's gaze. Eloise knew the routine: gentle probing, reassuring words, and hopefully, a healthy smile by the end of it all. But something about Mrs. Henderson's trembling hands and darting eyes suggested this appointment might be anything but ordinary.

Eloise took a deep breath, plastered on her best "everything will be fine" smile, and said, "Good morning, Mrs. Henderson. I'm Eloise, and I'll be taking care of you today."
