The air in Mama Rosa's kitchen hung thick with the scent of simmering tomatoes and oregano, a familiar comfort to Emilia Rossi. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing above the worn wooden table where Emilia kneaded dough for her famous focaccia. Outside, the narrow cobblestone streets of San Gimignano buzzed with the chatter of tourists and the clatter of Vespa scooters.

Emilia hummed along to an old Italian song crackling from the radio perched precariously on a shelf, her hands moving rhythmically as she worked the dough into a smooth, elastic ball. She was Mama Rosa's granddaughter, inheriting not only the family trattoria but also the generations-old recipes that had made it a beloved fixture in the Tuscan town.
