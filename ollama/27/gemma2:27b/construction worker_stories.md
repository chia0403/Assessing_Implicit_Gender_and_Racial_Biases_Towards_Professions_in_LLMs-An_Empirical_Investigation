The humid Florida air clung to Elias "Eli" Delgado like a second skin as he wrestled with a stubborn length of rebar. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes, but Eli didn't dare wipe it away. One hand had to stay firmly gripped on the metal rod, guiding it into place within the concrete formwork that would soon become the foundation for a luxury beachfront condo. The relentless drone of cicadas filled the air, punctuated by the clattering symphony of construction: the whine of power tools, the thudding of hammers, and the guttural roar of the cement mixer.

The sun beat down mercilessly on Eli's broad shoulders, turning his already tanned skin a deeper shade of bronze. The Miami skyline shimmered in the distance, a jagged silhouette against the cerulean sky. A stark contrast to the gritty construction site where Eli toiled, it represented the life he was building for himself, brick by agonizing brick.
