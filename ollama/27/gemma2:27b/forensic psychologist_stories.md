The air in Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Finch's office was thick with the scent of jasmine tea and old books – a combination as comforting to her as a warm blanket on a winter night.  Sunlight streamed through the arched window overlooking the cobblestone courtyard of the historic psychiatric hospital, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. 

Evelyn sighed, leaning back in her antique leather chair. The file on her desk held the details of her latest case: a string of seemingly random arson attacks plaguing the city.  The fire marshal was baffled, unable to find any clear motive or connection between the victims. That's where Evelyn came in – her expertise lay in understanding the twisted minds of criminals, in peeling back the layers of psyche to uncover the hidden triggers and motivations driving them towards unspeakable acts.

This case felt different though, a chill snaking down her spine as she reread the reports.  There was an unsettling pattern emerging, one that whispered of something more sinister than mere opportunism or thrill-seeking.
