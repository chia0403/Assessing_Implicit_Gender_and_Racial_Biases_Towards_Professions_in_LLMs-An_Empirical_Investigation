The humid New Orleans air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and beignets. Cicadas buzzed their incessant rhythm against the backdrop of distant jazz spilling from a nearby club. Amelia "Amy" Dupree squinted at the reflection in her salon window, smoothing down a stray curl escaping her elaborate French braid. Her salon, 'Chez Amy,' nestled on a quiet side street just off Bourbon Street, was bathed in the warm glow of the setting sun.  The scent of lavender shampoo mingled with the sweet perfume of magnolia blossoms drifting through the open door, creating a unique aroma that was as much a part of Chez Amy's charm as Amy herself. Today, however, the usual buzz of happy chatter and snipping scissors was replaced by an unsettling silence. A single flickering candle cast long shadows on the dusty bottles lining the shelves, and Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.
