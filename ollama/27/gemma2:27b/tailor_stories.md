The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the cluttered workshop, illuminating bolts of velvet in sapphire and ruby red, spools of thread glinting like captured starlight, and half-finished garments draped over mannequins with vacant stares. The air hung heavy with the scent of beeswax, lavender sachets, and a faint undercurrent of pipe tobacco â€“ the ever-present aroma of Elias Thorne, master tailor.

Elias, his silver hair pulled back in a tight bun, hunched over a length of emerald silk, his nimble fingers tracing the intricate pattern he was about to stitch. His brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously measured and pinned, the sharp glint of the needle reflecting in his tired but piercing blue eyes. Outside, the cobbled streets of Victorian London echoed with the clatter of carriages and the shouts of street vendors, a world away from the quiet sanctuary Elias had created within the worn wooden walls of his shop.  

But tonight, the usual rhythm of his work was broken by a persistent rapping at the door, a sound that cut through the silence like a shard of glass.
