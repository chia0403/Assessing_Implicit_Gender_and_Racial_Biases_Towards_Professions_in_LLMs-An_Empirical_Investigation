Rain lashed against the windows of Evergreen Physical Therapy, blurring the already muted autumn colors outside. The rhythmic drumming was almost hypnotic, a counterpoint to the steady beep of the ultrasound machine in Eliza Bennett’s hand. Her brow furrowed in concentration as she guided the wand over Mrs. Henderson’s inflamed shoulder, searching for the source of the nagging pain that had plagued the elderly woman for months.

Eliza loved her work. There was something deeply satisfying about helping people regain their mobility, to witness the flicker of hope return to their eyes when they took their first tentative steps after an injury, or lifted a weight they thought was beyond them. 


But today, Eliza couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. Mrs. Henderson was quieter than usual, her gaze flitting nervously around the room instead of focusing on Eliza’s soothing voice and gentle touch. The air crackled with unspoken tension, making Eliza acutely aware of the ticking clock on the wall.  

She needed to figure out what was bothering her patient before she could truly help her heal.
