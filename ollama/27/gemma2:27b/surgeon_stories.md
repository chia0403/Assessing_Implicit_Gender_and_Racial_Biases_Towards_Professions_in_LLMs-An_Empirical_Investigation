Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Vance.  She scrubbed her hands raw, the scent of antiseptic doing little to quell the acrid taste of fear that had lodged in her throat. Tonight was unlike any other. Tonight, she wasn't operating on a ruptured spleen or a broken femur. Tonight, she held the fate of a child – a girl barely five years old with a rare congenital heart defect – in her hands. 

The OR lights hummed overhead, casting an eerie glow on the stainless steel instruments laid out before her. Eleanor took a deep breath, reminding herself of all the hours spent studying anatomy, mastering complex surgical techniques. She could do this. She had to. Little Anya was counting on her.
