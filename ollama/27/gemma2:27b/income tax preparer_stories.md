Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Arthur's Accountants," blurring the neon OPEN sign into an indecipherable smear.  Inside, Eleanor Fitzwilliam sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation â€“ the familiar aroma of tax season. 

Eleanor wasn't born to be an accountant. She dreamt of writing novels set in faraway lands, not poring over spreadsheets filled with deductions and interest rates. But life had a way of steering you onto unexpected paths. And here she was, a self-proclaimed "number whisperer," helping her fellow denizens of this sleepy coastal town navigate the treacherous waters of the IRS. 

Today, however, felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Eleanor's spine as a cloaked figure stepped into the office, their face obscured by the shadows of their wide-brimmed hat.  The figure deposited a manila envelope on her desk with a thud and uttered only two words: "Help me."
