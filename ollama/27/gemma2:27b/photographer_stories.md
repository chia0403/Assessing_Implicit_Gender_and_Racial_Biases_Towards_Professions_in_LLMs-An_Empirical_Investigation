The air hung heavy with salt and the scent of drying seaweed as Elias Finch adjusted his tripod, the metal legs sinking slightly into the warm sand. Dawn was just breaking over the jagged cliffs of Cornwall, casting long shadows that stretched towards him like grasping fingers. The sky was ablaze with fiery oranges and bruised purples, reflecting in the rippling surface of the ocean below. 

Elias inhaled deeply, the cool air filling his lungs. He loved this time of day, the quiet stillness before the world awoke, when the only sound was the relentless crashing of waves against the shore. Today, he was hoping to capture the ethereal beauty of the sunrise reflected in a secluded cove he'd discovered on one of his many coastal explorations. It was a place untouched by human hands, a secret sanctuary he intended to immortalize through his lens.
