The humid air clung to Elara Rosalind Cartwright like a damp shawl as she wrestled with a rogue buttercream rose. It refused to bloom properly, drooping tragically towards the base of the three-tiered wedding cake.  Outside, New Orleans buzzed with life - jazz melodies drifted from unseen balconies, cicadas chirped their insistent song, and the scent of beignets mingled with the cloying sweetness of magnolia blossoms. But Elara, trapped in her tiny, sugar-dusted kitchen, felt a growing sense of despair.

This was supposed to be her masterpiece, a towering confection to celebrate the union of Amelia DuBois and Jean-Luc Moreau. Instead, it resembled a lopsided snowdrift with a single sad bloom clinging precariously to its side.  

She needed inspiration, something to jolt her out of this creative slump. Elara glanced at the clock - 2:37 PM. Just three hours until the cake was due at the DuBois mansion on Esplanade Avenue. Time was slipping through her fingers faster than sugar crystals melting in hot tea.
