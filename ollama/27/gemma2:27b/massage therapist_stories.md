Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the "Willow & Wisteria Wellness Center," blurring the quaint cobblestone street outside into an impressionist painting of gray and green. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lavender and chamomile, a calming contrast to the storm raging just beyond the frosted glass.

Eloise Hawthorne, her hands still warm from kneading away the knots in Mr. Henderson's shoulders, sighed contentedly.  She loved this part of her job, the quiet satisfaction of easing someone's aches and pains, of bringing them a moment of respite from the world's relentless grind. Eloise believed wholeheartedly in the power of touch, its ability to heal not just muscles but souls.

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease settled in her stomach as she tidied the massage room. It wasn't Mr. Henderson, who always left with a grateful smile and a promise to return.  No, it was a feeling that emanated from beyond the walls of the wellness center, a disquietude humming through the very air she breathed. Eloise glanced nervously at the clock â€“ 6:15 pm.  She should be locking up soon, but something compelled her to linger.
