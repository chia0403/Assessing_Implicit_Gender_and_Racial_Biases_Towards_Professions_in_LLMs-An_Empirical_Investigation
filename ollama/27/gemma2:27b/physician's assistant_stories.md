She sat perched on the edge of a rickety wooden stool, exhaustion gnawing at her bones. Despite the oppressive heat and humidity that clung to the air like a second skin, she shivered. The clinic, nestled deep within the Honduran rainforest, was barely more than a shack cobbled together from salvaged wood and metal sheets.

Tonight, Emilia Rosario, physician's assistant extraordinaire, would have to rely on every ounce of her skill and ingenuity to save this child's life.
