Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Salty Siren, a dive bar nestled in the shadow of the colossal shipping cranes that loomed over Port Azure.  Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the stale scent of spilled beer. Fiona Alistair, her trench coat dripping onto the worn linoleum floor, hunched over a chipped mug, the lukewarm coffee doing little to chase away the chill seeping into her bones.

Fiona wasn't supposed to be here. This story was meant for someone else, someone with a stomach stronger than hers, someone who didn't flinch at the whispers that followed her like shadows in this city. But Liam, the senior reporter and Fiona's mentor, had been hospitalized with pneumonia, leaving Fiona to pick up the slack.

Her assignment: infiltrate the underground dockworker network rumored to be involved in smuggling illegal artifacts out of Port Azure. It wasnâ€™t just any artifact they were talking about; whispers spoke of a relic stolen from the lost city of El Dorado, rumored to possess untold power. Fiona knew this story could make her career, but it also had the potential to get her killed.  

She glanced around at the hardened faces staring back at her through the haze. Sailors with missing fingers and eyes dulled by years at sea. Men with scars etched into their skin like roadmaps of past battles.  Fiona felt a familiar knot tighten in her stomach. This was dangerous territory, and she wasn't sure she belonged here.
