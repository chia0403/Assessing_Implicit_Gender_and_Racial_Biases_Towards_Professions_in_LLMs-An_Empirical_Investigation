The air hung thick with humidity, the scent of salt water and stale cigarettes clinging to the faded grandeur of The Seacrest Hotel.  Palm trees swayed listlessly outside, their fronds casting elongated shadows across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot. Inside, Theodore "Teddy" Beaumont wrestled with a mountain of luggage, his threadbare uniform straining against the weight. 

A bead of sweat trickled down Teddy's temple, stinging his eye. He blinked it away, grumbling under his breath about the audacity of some guests to bring enough belongings for a month-long expedition when they were only staying for a weekend.  He hefted another suitcase, its leather cracked and worn, and trudged towards the ornate elevator, its brass cage tarnished with age.

The Seacrest had seen better days. Once a playground for the rich and famous, it was now a faded relic, its faded glamour barely visible beneath the dust and neglect. Teddy, with his perpetually tired eyes and calloused hands, was a testament to the hotel's decline, a bell hop clinging onto a fading dream.
