Eleanor, the only vet for miles, found herself wrestling with case after case, each dog's rasping cough and fevered brow echoing the growing worry in her own heart.

Today, a new patient awaited her – one that promised to be both challenging and intriguing: a majestic wolfhound, its silver fur as pale as the storm clouds gathering outside. Eleanor straightened her posture, steeling herself for the unknown. This wasn't just another case of canine flu; this was something else entirely.  Something she couldn't quite put her finger on… but something that felt undeniably significant.
