The bell above the door chimed with a tired jingle as Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins adjusted his spectacles and peered at the newcomer. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Bart's Barber Shop, blurring the neon sign that flickered "Open" in defiance of the storm. The man who stepped inside was drenched to the bone, water dripping from his fedora onto the worn checkered floor. He looked like trouble â€“ a weary kind of trouble with eyes as grey and stormy as the day outside. Bart sighed, setting down his razor. Another late night haircut. It wasn't unusual for folks in Oakhaven to seek refuge in his shop, a comforting haven of leather chairs, the scent of bay rum, and the steady hum of clippers. 

Bart gestured towards the nearest chair with a calloused hand. "Sit yourself down, son," he said, his voice gravelly from years of calling out names and engaging in idle chatter.  "Let's see what we can do about that mop." The man hesitated for a moment before slumping onto the seat, his shoulders heavy with an unseen weight.

Bart knew better than to pry. He had learned long ago that sometimes silence was the best barbering tool.

As he draped a crisp white towel over the stranger's shoulders, Bart couldn't help but wonder about the story hidden behind those tired eyes. What brought him to Oakhaven on this dreary night? What secrets lurked beneath the surface of his rain-soaked coat?
