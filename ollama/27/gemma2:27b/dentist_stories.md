Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's dental practice, blurring the neon glow of the 'Smiling Faces Dentistry' sign hanging above the door. The quaint Victorian building nestled on Elm Street had seen better days, much like Ellie herself. Exhaustion tugged at her eyelids, and a persistent ache throbbed behind her left temple.

It was a Wednesday, which meant late hours for walk-ins. Ellie sighed, picking up the phone to reschedule Mr. Henderson's 7pm appointment due to his sudden flu. The storm had knocked out power in several blocks, and she doubted he'd be venturing out anytime soon.

Ellie glanced at the clock â€“ 6:15 pm. Three patients remained: a chatty teenager getting braces adjusted, a middle-aged woman with a chipped molar, and... something unfamiliar scribbled in hurried handwriting on her schedule card. 

"Dr. Blackwood," Ellie muttered, squinting at the name. "Haven't seen that one before." A shiver ran down her spine. Something about Dr. Blackwood felt... off. But dismissing it as pre-storm jitters, she reached for her instruments, bracing herself for another long night.
