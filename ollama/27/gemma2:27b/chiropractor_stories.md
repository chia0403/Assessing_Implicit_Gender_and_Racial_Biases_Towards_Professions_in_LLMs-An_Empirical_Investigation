Rain lashed against the warped glass pane of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's office window, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The scent of disinfectant and lavender oil couldn't mask the underlying tension that permeated the small waiting room. Ellie glanced at the clock – 5:47 PM. Only three minutes until closing time.

Her practice, nestled on a quiet side street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina, was usually buzzing with patients. Today, however, had been eerily slow. The silence felt heavy, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional groan from Ellie's aging wooden chair.

She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. A feeling of unease gnawed at her. It wasn’t just the lack of patients today; it was something else, an intangible sense of foreboding that she couldn't shake. 


What happens next?
