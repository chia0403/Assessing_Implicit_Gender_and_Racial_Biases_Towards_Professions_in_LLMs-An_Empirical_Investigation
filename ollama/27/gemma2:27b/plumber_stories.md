Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Arthur Bartholomew Quill's plumbing van like a thousand tiny hammers. The rhythmic drumming, usually calming, grated on Arthur's nerves today. He gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white, as he navigated the slick streets of Oakhaven. A perpetual drizzle had hung over the town for days, turning everything into a sodden mess and sending his call volume skyrocketing.

Oakhaven wasn't exactly known for its bustling nightlife or glamorous attractions; it was a sleepy coastal town where everyone knew everyone else's business, and the biggest excitement revolved around the annual clam chowder contest. But Arthur loved it. The salty air, the creaky wooden houses lining cobbled streets, the friendly faces â€“ it all felt like home. 

Today, however, even the familiar comfort of Oakhaven couldn't soothe his frayed nerves. He was late for a call at Mrs. Hawthorne's, a notoriously demanding customer known for her withering glares and penchant for complaining about "shoddy workmanship" (even though Arthur had never once received a complaint).
