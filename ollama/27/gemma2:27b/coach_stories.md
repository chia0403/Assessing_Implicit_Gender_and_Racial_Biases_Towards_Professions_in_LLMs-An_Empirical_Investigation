The scent of stale sweat and chlorine hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's workout clothes like a second skin. The fluorescent lights of the community center pool flickered overhead, casting an unsettling strobe effect on the rippling water. Ellie perched on the edge of the diving platform, her legs dangling over the turquoise abyss, and surveyed the scene before her.

The Wednesday night swim team practice was in full swing. A cacophony of splashing, shouts, and the rhythmic clang of the starting block filled the air. Teenagers, their faces flushed with exertion, churned through the water, their strokes varying from elegant to downright chaotic. Ellie sighed, a deep, weary sound that mingled with the pool's humid breath. Coaching was more than just a job for her; it was her lifeblood. But lately, the joy had been slowly draining away, replaced by a persistent ache in her heart and a gnawing sense of unease.
