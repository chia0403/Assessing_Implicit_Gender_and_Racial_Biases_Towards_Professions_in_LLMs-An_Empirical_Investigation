The rusted wrought iron gates groaned open like an arthritic hand, revealing a crumbling Victorian mansion that seemed to sag under the weight of its own history.  Eleanor Ainsworth, her sensible heels crunching on the gravel driveway, tightened her grip on the leather folder containing the property details.

Sunlight filtered through the overgrown magnolia trees, casting dappled shadows on the peeling paint and boarded-up windows.  The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and decaying leaves, a stark contrast to the lavender perfume Eleanor wore, a deliberate attempt at projecting confidence in the face of this derelict behemoth. 


This was no ordinary listing for Eleanor. This house, shrouded in local legend and whispers of a tragic past, was her chance to prove herself. To show the jaded partners at Ainsworth & Blackwood that she wasn't just another trust-fund baby with a fancy degree and even fancier connections. She could actually sell anything, even this crumbling monument to forgotten grandeur.
