Rain lashed against the windowpane, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside Eleanor Vance's chest. Her small office, perched on the third floor of a Victorian townhouse overlooking a windswept London square, felt suffocating.  The comforting scent of lavender oil, usually a calming presence, seemed to mock her current state of unease. A crumpled tissue lay forgotten on the mahogany desk, a testament to her earlier outburst of frustration.

Eleanor, with her auburn curls escaping their neat bun and worry lines etched around her hazel eyes, stared at the clock ticking relentlessly towards five o'clock.  It was then she was due to meet Michael Ashton, a new client who'd requested an evening session. 

He'd been vague on the phone, simply stating he needed someone to "make sense of things."  Eleanor prided herself on her ability to connect with people, to delve into their darkest corners and help them find a glimmer of hope. But something about Michael's hesitant voice and veiled words had unsettled her.  As the sky outside darkened, Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that this evening wouldn't be like any other.
