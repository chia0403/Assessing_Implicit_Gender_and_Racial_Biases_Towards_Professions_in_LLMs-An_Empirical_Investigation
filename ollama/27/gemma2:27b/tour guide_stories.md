The midday sun beat down on Emilia Beatrice Cartwright's freckled nose as she gestured towards the crumbling Roman aqueduct. "This magnificent structure," she announced to her small group of tourists, her voice ringing clear despite the heat, "was built nearly two thousand years ago and carried fresh water for miles into the heart of ancient Pompeii."

Emilia loved sharing the history of this place. The ruins whispered stories of everyday life frozen in time - a baker's oven still containing charred loaves, a merchant's shop with jars of olives and spices overturned, children's toys scattered on the dusty ground.  But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran up her spine as she scanned the faces of her group. They seemed unusually quiet, their gazes fixed on the aqueduct with an unnerving intensity. Emilia shrugged it off, attributing it to the oppressive heat. 

Still, as she led them deeper into Pompeii, the feeling persisted, growing stronger with every step. The air hung heavy and silent, broken only by the distant cawing of crows and the crunch of their sandals on the volcanic ash.  The shadows seemed to lengthen unnaturally, and Emilia swore she saw figures flitting at the edges of her vision - wisps of smoke curling into human shapes, then vanishing as quickly as they appeared. 

Today, Emilia realized with a growing sense of dread, Pompeii wasn't just whispering its stories. It was screaming them.
