The insistent buzz of Eliza Thorne's phone dragged her from a dream where fonts danced on emerald vines and Pantone colors bled into the sunset. Groaning, she slapped at the nightstand until the noise subsided. 5:32 AM glared back at her from the screen. "Ugh," Eliza muttered, burying herself deeper under the duvet.

She lived in a converted loft overlooking the vibrant chaos of Brooklyn's Williamsburg. Exposed brick walls, adorned with Eliza's own quirky graphic prints, framed a space both minimalist and cluttered, reflecting the duality of her personality: meticulous yet fueled by bursts of creative mayhem. Her desk, usually a battlefield of crumpled sketches and paint-splattered coffee mugs, was surprisingly pristine this morning, testament to a late-night design frenzy for a new client's indie comic book cover.

A pang of anxiety shot through Eliza.  The deadline loomed like a hungry monster, and she hadn't quite nailed the crucial panel showcasing the protagonist's transformation. The image in her head was vivid – raw power tinged with melancholy – but translating it onto the screen remained elusive.


Eliza reluctantly threw off the covers, knowing procrastination wouldn't tame the beast of deadlines. The city outside was still slumbering, its skyscrapers veiled in a pre-dawn mist. But within Eliza's loft, the day had already begun, fueled by caffeine and the relentless pursuit of visual perfection.
