The rusted gate creaked like an arthritic knee as Elias Thorne pushed it open, the sound echoing through the stillness of dawn. The air was crisp, tinged with the scent of dew-kissed roses and decaying leaves. Elias, his weathered face framed by a shock of greying hair, surveyed the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor with a practiced eye.

Ivy clung stubbornly to the crumbling stone walls, while overgrown hedges threatened to engulf the ancient fountain at its centre. A lone oak tree, twisted and gnarled like an arthritic hand, cast long shadows across the neglected rose garden, its petals scattered like crimson tears on the damp grass.

Blackwood Manor had once been a place of grandeur, but now it stood shrouded in silence, a fading monument to forgotten dreams. Elias, the sole caretaker for as long as he could remember, felt an inexplicable connection to this decaying edifice. Its secrets whispered to him through the rustling leaves and the mournful howl of the wind that swept across the desolate moorland beyond.
