The midday sun beat down on Elias Hawthorne's back as he chipped away at the stubborn granite block. Dust motes danced in the air, swirling with the heat rising from the dusty yard. The rhythmic clang of his chisel against stone was the only sound breaking the stillness of the Tuscan countryside. Around him, other stone cutters worked diligently, their faces grim with concentration under the unforgiving sun.

Elias paused, wiping the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. He squinted at the block, tracing the outline of the cherub he was carving. It would be the centerpiece for a wealthy merchant's fountain, a testament to Elias' skill and patience. Yet, despite the demanding work, a restless yearning gnawed at him. He dreamed of something more than chipping away at stone, shaping it into someone else's vision.

He longed to create his own art, to breathe life into the cold, unyielding rock with stories whispered only by his heart. But such dreams seemed frivolous in this world where survival depended on fulfilling commissions and appeasing demanding patrons.
