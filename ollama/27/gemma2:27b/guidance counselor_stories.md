The stale air in Ms. Elara Winthrop's office hung thick with the scent of yesterday's desperation. Posters plastered on the walls – "Follow Your Dreams!" "Choose Your Path!", "You Can Be Anything!" – mocked her current state of mind. It was 3:17 pm on a Tuesday, and Elara felt about as hopeful as a wilted dandelion. She stared out the window at the sprawling lawn of Westbridge High, watching students scatter like pigeons after the final bell.  

Elara wasn't meant for this. Guiding teenagers through the labyrinth of college applications, standardized tests, and existential crises had seemed noble enough when she first accepted the position. But lately, it felt like her own dreams were fading into the background noise of teenage angst. 


Today was no different. Her calendar overflowed with appointments: a sobbing sophomore grappling with a failed math test, an overachiever paralyzed by the fear of choosing the "wrong" college, and a senior who seemed utterly convinced he'd invented time travel. Elara sighed.  Maybe she needed a vacation, or perhaps a complete career change. Anything to escape this cycle of teenage turmoil. 

Suddenly, a sharp knock startled her from her reverie. A tall figure loomed in the doorway, casting a long shadow across the cluttered office floor. Elara recognized him immediately – Aiden Blackwood, the school's resident enigma. He rarely spoke, preferring to disappear into the library stacks with his nose perpetually buried in a book.  What could he possibly want from her?
