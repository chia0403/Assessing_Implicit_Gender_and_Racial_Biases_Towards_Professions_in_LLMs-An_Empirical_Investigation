Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the city lights into an impressionistic smear. Dr. Eleanor Vance, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun, stared out at the storm from her fifth-floor office. The sterile white walls and minimalist décor did little to soften the oppressive atmosphere. Even the potted fern in the corner seemed to droop under the weight of the dreary weather.

Eleanor had just finished a particularly draining session with a young woman battling severe anxiety. The case was complex, riddled with childhood trauma and self-doubt, leaving Eleanor feeling emotionally drained despite her years of experience. She longed for a hot cup of tea and the comforting silence of her apartment, but another appointment loomed – a late evening consultation with a new client, someone shrouded in mystery.

The only information Eleanor had was a name: Mr. Silas Blackwood. He'd requested anonymity, refused to divulge any details about his issues over the phone, and insisted on meeting after dark. A shiver ran down Eleanor's spine. Something about this request felt off, unsettlingly enigmatic. Yet, curiosity warred with caution, piquing her interest in the shadowy figure behind the name.
