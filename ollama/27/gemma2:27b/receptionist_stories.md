The incessant chirping of the antique clock perched above the mahogany reception desk was starting to grate on Elara Rosalind Finch's nerves. 

It wasn't the sound itself that bothered her - she rather liked its quirky trill - but the fact that it meant Mr. Bellingham, the owner of this dusty old bookstore, "Bellingham & Sons: Purveyors of Literary Treasures," was due back any minute. Elara always felt a wave of anxiety wash over her when his shadow loomed in the doorway. 

He had a habit of scrutinizing everything - her posture, the way she arranged the worn leather-bound books on display, even the angle of the brass pen holder on her desk. Today, the pressure felt particularly acute.  She'd just rearranged the entire "Rare First Editions" shelf according to Mr. Bellingham's latest (and notoriously convoluted) alphabetical system.

Elara took a deep breath and smoothed down her starched white blouse. Outside the arched window overlooking cobbled Baker Street, the rain hammered down, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Today was the day she planned to hand in her notice.
