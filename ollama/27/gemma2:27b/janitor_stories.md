The fluorescent lights hummed a relentless dirge as Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew mopped the linoleum floor of the Grand Blackwood Opera House. His shadow stretched long and thin in the empty auditorium, swallowed by the velvet darkness of the balconies above. Dust motes danced in the pale light that filtered through the grimy windows, each one a miniature ballerina pirouetting on stage. 

Teddy wasn't much for opera, but he appreciated the grandeur of the old theatre. Its history whispered from every gilded carving, every faded tapestry, every chipped marble step. He imagined the thunderous applause, the soaring voices, the hushed anticipation that once filled these hallowed halls. Now, it was just him and the ghosts, his mop squeaking a lonely rhythm across the polished floor.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A shiver ran down Teddy's spine as he rounded a corner backstage. The air hung heavy with a cloying sweetness, like overripe fruit.  He caught a glimpse of movement in the shadows â€“ a flicker of white, gone before he could focus.
