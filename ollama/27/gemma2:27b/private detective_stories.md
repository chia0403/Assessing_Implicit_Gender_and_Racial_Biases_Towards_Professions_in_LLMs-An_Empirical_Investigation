Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair "Al" Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" bar across the street. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and damp cigarette butts â€“ the usual aroma of Al's world. He sat hunched over his desk, a half-eaten bowl of instant noodles congealing beside a stack of files that threatened to topple over. A single bare bulb cast harsh shadows across his face, highlighting the lines etched deep by years spent chasing shadows and secrets in the labyrinthine alleys of New Orleans. 

The phone buzzed, jarring Al from his contemplation. He snatched it up, the receiver cold against his ear. "Finch Investigations," he growled, his voice rough as gravel.  "What can I do for you?"
