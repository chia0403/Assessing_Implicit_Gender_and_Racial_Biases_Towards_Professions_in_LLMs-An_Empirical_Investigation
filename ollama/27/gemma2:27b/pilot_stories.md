The frigid Alaskan air stung Amelia "Ace" Cartwright's face as she wrestled the Cessna 185 into position on the icy runway.  Snow swirled around her, obscuring the distant peaks of the Chugach Mountains in a ghostly veil. Ace squinted through the windshield, her breath fogging the glass momentarily. This wasn't your average Alaskan landing strip - it was carved out of frozen tundra, barely visible from the air until you were practically on top of it.

Ace adjusted the throttle and flaps, feeling the familiar hum of the engine vibrate beneath her.  Delivering supplies to these remote research stations was a risky business, but she wouldn't trade it for anything. There was something exhilarating about navigating through treacherous mountain passes, battling icy winds, and touching down on makeshift runways that seemed to defy gravity. 

Today's cargo: vital scientific equipment for the team studying glacial meltwater in Denali National Park. The researchers were counting on her to get it there before the next blizzard rolled in.  Ace tapped the radio microphone. "Denali Station, this is Cartwright. I'm approaching the runway." A crackle of static followed by a gruff voice replied, "Cartwright, we see you. Be careful out there - wind's picking up."

Ace swallowed, feeling a knot tighten in her stomach. This was just the beginning. The real test lay ahead - a perilous descent through a narrow canyon choked with swirling snow.
