The scent of almond oil and hairspray hung thick in the air, a familiar and comforting perfume to Elodie Beaumont. Sunlight streamed through the large front window of "Elodie's Enchantments", casting warm squares onto the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the bustling heart of New Orleans throbbed with its usual symphony of jazz music, rumbling streetcars, and chattering tourists.  

Elodie hummed along to Irma Thomas crooning on the radio as she carefully sectioned Mrs. Delacroix's fiery red hair, preparing for a dramatic transformation. Today was all about embracing the silver that had been stubbornly creeping in, turning it into a crown of shimmering highlights. Mrs. Delacroix was nervous, but Elodie could see the glimmer of excitement in her eyes â€“ the promise of reinvention and a fresh start.
