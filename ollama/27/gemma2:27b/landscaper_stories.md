The late afternoon sun beat down on Elias Finnigan's neck as he wrestled with a stubborn rose bush. Its thorns, thick and sharp like tiny obsidian needles, snagged at his worn cotton gloves. Sweat stung his eyes, but Elias persisted, tugging and twisting until the bush finally surrendered, its roots coming free from the parched earth with a satisfying rip.

Elias surveyed his work: a riot of color spilling across Mrs. Peabody's front yard. Lavender hydrangeas brushed against blushing pink peonies, while fiery orange marigolds danced in the breeze. He took pride in coaxing beauty from the earth, turning neglected patches into vibrant havens. Today, however, Elias’s heart wasn't in it.

His gaze drifted towards the weathered Victorian house looming at the end of the street. The windows were dark, reflecting the setting sun like empty eyes. That was where she lived – Eloise Davenport, a recluse whispered about by the townsfolk. Some said she was cursed, others that she held dangerous secrets. Elias, a pragmatist at heart, dismissed those rumors as mere gossip. Yet, something about the house, its overgrown ivy and crumbling stone facade, tugged at him with an unsettling curiosity.  

He wiped the sweat from his brow, the setting sun casting long shadows across the lawn. Today was just another day in Willow Creek, a town where secrets bloomed alongside the azaleas. But Elias felt a shift in the air, a premonition that this ordinary Tuesday would soon become anything but.
