The fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Thaddeus Finch, their pale glow reflecting off his meticulously clean drafting table. Sheets of vellum paper, crisp and white, lay scattered across its surface like fallen snow.  Elias ran a calloused fingertip along the precise lines of a half-finished blueprint for a Victorian-style conservatory, the graphite smudging slightly. Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof of Finch & Sons Drafting, sending waves of heat through the dusty workshop.

Elias sighed, pushing back his thick-rimmed spectacles and wiping sweat from his brow with a frayed handkerchief. He longed for the cool breeze promised by the approaching evening, but knew he wouldn't leave until every line was perfect, every dimension calculated to within a hair's breadth. That was the Finch way, after all â€“ precision, quality, unwavering attention to detail.

Today, however, his mind strayed from the conservatory's elegant curves and delicate latticework. A letter lay unopened on the corner of his table, its creamy envelope sealed with crimson wax bearing the crest of a distant relative he barely knew. The words "Urgent Matter" scrawled across it in spidery handwriting tugged at him like an invisible thread. He knew he should open it, but a flicker of apprehension kept him rooted to his chair.
