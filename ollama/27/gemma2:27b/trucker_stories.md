The greasy spoon diner hummed with the low thrum of conversation and the sizzle of bacon on the griddle. Outside, Interstate 80 stretched endlessly across the Nevada desert, shimmering under the merciless midday sun. Silas "Steady" Jackson sat hunched over a steaming mug of coffee, his weathered face illuminated by the flickering neon sign that declared "Joe's Eats - Best Grub This Side of Reno." His calloused hands, scarred from years of hauling freight and wrestling with stubborn tarp buckles, gripped the chipped ceramic handle.

Silas wasn't a man for idle chatter. He preferred the company of his trusty Peterbilt, nicknamed "Ol' Bessie," and the endless ribbon of asphalt that stretched before him like a promise. But today, something felt different. A restlessness gnawed at him, fueled by a cryptic message scrawled on a faded napkin he'd found tucked under his windshield wiper. It simply read: "Sunset Pass. Midnight. Be there."
