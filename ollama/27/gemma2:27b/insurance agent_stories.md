Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, distorted shadows across the worn carpet, further amplifying the sense of claustrophobia. Bart chewed on his thumbnail, nervously eyeing the stack of overdue claims on his desk. Each file represented a family struggling to rebuild after a disaster, a life disrupted by unforeseen tragedy. And Bart, despite his best efforts, was drowning in paperwork. 

He had always envisioned himself as a knight in shining armor, protecting people from financial ruin with meticulously crafted insurance policies. But the reality of being an agent for "SureThing Insurance" felt more like navigating a labyrinth of bureaucratic red tape and facing down unreasonable demands from disgruntled customers. The phone on his desk buzzed incessantly, each call another reminder of his ever-growing backlog. Bart sighed, bracing himself for the onslaught.

He picked up the receiver, plastering on his practiced "can-do" smile. "Bart Higgins speaking, how can I help you?" he chirped, hoping against hope that this call wouldn't be another nail in the coffin of his already dwindling optimism.
