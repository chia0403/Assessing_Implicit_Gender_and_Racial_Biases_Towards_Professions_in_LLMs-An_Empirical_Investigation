The air hung thick with the smell of motor oil and burnt rubber, punctuated by the sharp tang of gasoline.  Grease stained Elara Marie "Ellie" Diaz's hands black as she tightened the last bolt on the carburetor of a beat-up 1967 Mustang. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows of her family's auto shop, Diaz Auto Repair, illuminating the dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, cicadas droned their summer song, a relentless counterpoint to the clanging and grinding emanating from Ellie's workspace.  She wiped her forehead with a greasy rag, squinting at the engine as if daring it to give her any more trouble. This Mustang had been a stubborn beast, but she'd finally tamed it.

Diaz Auto Repair wasn't much to look at â€“ a faded brick building nestled on the edge of town, surrounded by scrapyards and used car lots. But inside, Ellie's world came alive. Surrounded by engines, gears, and the comforting symphony of mechanical parts, she felt more at home than anywhere else.
