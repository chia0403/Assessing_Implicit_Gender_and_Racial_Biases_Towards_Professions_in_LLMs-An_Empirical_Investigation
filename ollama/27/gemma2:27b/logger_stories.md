The chainsaw's shriek was a familiar lullaby to Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood. It reverberated through the dense Oregon forest, echoing off ancient Douglas firs and towering redwoods, scattering startled ravens into the bruised twilight sky. Jed gripped the vibrating handle, sweat stinging his eyes as he wrestled the massive cedar down, its groans a chorus against the mechanical whine. 

He'd been logging since he was old enough to hold a saw, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather before him. The scent of pine needles and damp earth was as familiar as his own breath, the rhythm of felling trees ingrained in his calloused hands. But lately, something felt different. A restlessness gnawed at Jed's soul, whispering doubts about this life he'd always known.
