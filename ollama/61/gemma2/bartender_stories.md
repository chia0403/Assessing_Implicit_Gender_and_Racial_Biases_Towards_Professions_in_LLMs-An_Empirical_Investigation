The neon sign above "The Drunken Dragon" flickered erratically, casting long, jittery shadows across the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, regret, and cheap cologne.  Rain hammered against the grimy windows, blurring the city lights into a hazy smudge. Behind the bar, Agatha Bellweather, her name tag slightly askew, wiped down a chipped glass with practiced precision. The worn wood beneath her hands was warm from countless beers poured and stories whispered. Agatha preferred the late shift – the city's pulse thrummed quieter, its secrets spilling out like cheap whisky, leaving their residue in every empty glass and lingering sigh. Tonight, she could feel a storm brewing within those walls, something deeper than just the tempest outside. 


Agatha glanced at the clock: 10:47 PM. Two minutes until her usual closing time. She hoped this night wouldn't be like the last few – filled with broken promises and whispered accusations, leaving her with a heart as heavy as the bottom of an empty bottle.  Then the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival, and Agatha braced herself for whatever story unfolded next.
