The air in the Grand Blackwood Library was thick with the scent of aged paper and vanilla polish. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick, perched on a ladder between shelves groaning under the weight of leather-bound volumes, sighed contentedly.  She loved this time of day, the quiet hum of the library settling into its afternoon lull before the after-school rush. A symphony of rustling pages and gentle whispers usually filled the air, but today, an unsettling silence had fallen upon the hallowed halls. 

Eleanor carefully extracted a first edition Shakespeare from its shelf, her fingers trailing over its worn spine.  Something felt amiss. The usual comforting presence of knowledge and history seemed muted, replaced by a palpable tension that prickled at her skin. A shiver ran down her spine, sending goosebumps erupting across her arms despite the warmth of the sunbeam on her face.
