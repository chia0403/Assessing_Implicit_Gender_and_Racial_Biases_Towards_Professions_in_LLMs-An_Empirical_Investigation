The air hung thick with humidity and the smell of stale coffee in Ms. Eleanor Vance's tiny office. It was barely past 7:00 AM, but the fluorescent lights already buzzed like angry wasps, casting an unflattering yellow pallor on everything. Outside, the dawn bled through the grime-coated windows, revealing a city that slept with its eyes half-open - still teetering between the last vestiges of night and the full glare of another day.  Eleanor, her hair pulled back in a tight bun and her sensible shoes tapping impatiently against the linoleum floor, was already on her second cup, staring at the pile of files threatening to overflow from her desk. Her gaze lingered on one file in particular: "Johnson, Marcus," it read in bold black letters, accompanied by a mugshot that promised more trouble than a rainy day.  Marcus Johnson. Another case waiting for Eleanor's steady hand and firm resolve to navigate the treacherous currents of probation.
