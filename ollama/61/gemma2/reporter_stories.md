The acrid scent of burnt rubber and exhaust hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elena Ramirez's trench coat like a shroud.  She gripped her notepad tighter, its flimsy pages rustling in the biting wind that whipped across the deserted city street. The neon signs above the shuttered businesses flickered erratically, casting long, distorted shadows that danced with the swaying flames engulfing the abandoned car at the center of the scene.
