The humid Atlanta air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain.  Officer Amelia "Amy" Hayes adjusted her cap, shielding her eyes from the glare reflecting off the grimy windows of the dilapidated motel. A faded neon sign buzzed erratically above the entrance, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cracked asphalt parking lot. 

Amy took a deep breath, the stale cigarette smoke and lingering scent of cheap perfume assaulting her nostrils. This wasn't exactly the glamorous side of law enforcement she'd envisioned when she joined the force. But it was Atlanta, where even the shadows whispered secrets, and sometimes, those secrets ended up bloody.  


She gripped her badge tighter, a small comfort in this sea of uncertainty. Her call had been vague: "Disturbance, possible domestic." Nothing specific, just another night shift tending to the city's underbelly. But something about the way the dispatcher had said it, laced with a hint of weariness and fear, made Amy's pulse quicken. This wasn't going to be your average Tuesday night.
