The scent of linseed oil hung thick in the air, mingling with the dust motes dancing in the shaft of sunlight piercing through the loft window. Eloise Amelia Cartwright adjusted her beret, the crimson fabric matching the fiery hues bleeding across the canvas before her. Her easel stood sentinel in the center of the room, a towering testament to her ambition and isolation.
