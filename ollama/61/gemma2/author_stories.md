The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across Eleanor Rosalind Vance's cluttered desk.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes of her attic room, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the glass. The wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the eaves of the old Victorian house and sending shivers down Eleanor's spine. 

Outside, London was drowning in a deluge, but inside, Eleanorâ€™s world was one of swirling words and fantastical creatures. She hunched over her worn typewriter, her fingers flying across the keys as she brought to life a world of dragons and sorcerers, of brave knights and cunning villains.  Her latest novel, "The Shadow Crown," was due in six weeks, and Eleanor was desperate to finish it.

The rain was relentless as Eleanor stepped out into the darkened street. The lamplight cast an eerie glow on the cobblestones, making the puddles shimmer like pools of liquid mercury. Each footstep sent a splash of water up onto her worn boots, soaking her already damp socks.  She pulled her shawl tighter around herself and trudged onward, her mind adrift in a sea of unanswered questions.
