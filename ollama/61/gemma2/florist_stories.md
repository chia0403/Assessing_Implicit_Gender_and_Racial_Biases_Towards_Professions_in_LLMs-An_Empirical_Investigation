The bell above the shop door tinkled its welcome as Amelia Clementine Everly straightened a vase of sunflowers, their golden faces tilted towards the weak winter sun slanting through the dusty shop window.  A chill wind rattled the panes, stirring the scent of pine and cinnamon that hung heavy in the air, mingling with the fresh earthiness of lilies and roses.  Amelia's own breath puffed out in small white clouds as she surveyed her domain - "Everly Blooms," a quaint haven tucked away on a cobbled side street in the heart of Edinburgh. Its faded Victorian brick facade was adorned with climbing ivy that clung tenaciously to the walls, much like Amelia herself, her spirit refusing to wilt even amidst the city's relentless chill.

Today was particularly bleak. Not just for the weather, but for business too. The festive cheer of Christmas had long since passed, leaving behind a lingering emptiness in its wake.  Amelia sighed, tracing her fingers over the velvet petals of a ruby red rose.  It was a lonely day for a florist, she mused, when all that bloomed were memories.
