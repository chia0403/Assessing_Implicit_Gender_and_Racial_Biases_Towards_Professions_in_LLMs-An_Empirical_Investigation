The humid Florida air clung to Elias Thorne like a damp shroud as he climbed the rickety ladder leading to the porch roof. Sweat beaded on his forehead, dripping down into his eyes, blurring the dilapidated Victorian house before him. A symphony of cicadas buzzed in the overgrown hedges, their incessant droning punctuated by the distant rumble of thunder – a familiar soundtrack to Elias's summer evenings. This one, however, had an edge of unease to it. The air crackled with a tension that went beyond the impending storm, and the house itself seemed to sag under a weight of untold secrets.  

Elias, his calloused hands gripping the worn wood, squinted at the fuse box – its metal casing dented and scarred, like an old warrior bearing the marks of countless battles. It was clearly ancient, cobbled together from spare parts and duct tape. This wasn't just a routine repair job; this was a glimpse into a forgotten past, and Elias had a feeling it wouldn't be pretty.
