The bell above the door chimed its familiar melody as Elias Thorne surveyed his shop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper and worn leather chairs arranged in neat rows.  Elias ran a hand over his own neatly trimmed beard, his reflection staring back from the polished chrome of the antique barber mirror. It was just past eight on a Wednesday morning, and already the air hummed with the anticipatory energy that always accompanied the start of another day at Thorne’s Barber Shop. 


His small shop, tucked away on a quiet side street in the bustling heart of downtown Maple Creek, had been his father's before him, its walls whispering stories of generations of men who had sat in those very chairs, sharing their secrets, anxieties, and triumphs with Elias and his father. The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that had become as synonymous with Thorne’s as Elias himself. 


A shadow fell across the linoleum floor, and Elias looked up to see Mrs. Peterson, her eyes crinkled at the corners with a familiar smile, holding two steaming mugs of coffee.  
“Morning, Elias,” she chirped, placing the mugs on the counter. “Heard you had a late night catching up on paperwork.”


Elias chuckled, accepting his mug gratefully. "You heard wrong, Mrs. Peterson. Just another restless night." He took a sip, savoring the warmth that spread through him. "But coffee always fixes that." 
  He glanced at the street outside, where the first few customers were beginning to gather, their faces etched with anticipation for a fresh start. It was going to be a busy day.


“Just another day in Thorne’s,” he murmured, his eyes twinkling with a mixture of weariness and contentment. He took another sip of coffee, savoring the moment before the familiar symphony of clippers and razors filled the air once more.
