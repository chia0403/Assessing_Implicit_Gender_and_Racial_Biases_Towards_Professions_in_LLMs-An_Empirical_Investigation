The air hung heavy with the scent of hay and disinfectant as Dr. Eleanor Willow adjusted her stethoscope. Her small veterinary clinic, nestled amidst rolling green hills in rural Vermont, was quiet for once. Usually, by this time on a Tuesday morning, a steady stream of furry patients would be arriving – anxious kittens, whimpering puppies, and everything in between. But today, the silence was almost deafening.  Eleanor sighed, idly scratching the chin of Patches, her ginger tabby who had claimed the exam room as his personal throne. 

It wasn’t that she disliked the quiet; she relished moments where she could catch up on paperwork or simply enjoy a cup of chamomile tea without interruption. But the stillness felt unsettling, like an unexpected pause in a familiar melody. A nagging worry, one she couldn't quite articulate, gnawed at her. 


The lull was broken by the rhythmic whirring of a tractor engine approaching from down the lane. Eleanor glanced out the window, a sliver of hope flickering within her. Maybe this unusual quietness was about to end with a flurry of furry faces and anxious owners.  She straightened her scrub jacket, smoothed her auburn hair, and prepared herself for whatever – or whoever – might be waiting on the other side of that weathered oak door.
