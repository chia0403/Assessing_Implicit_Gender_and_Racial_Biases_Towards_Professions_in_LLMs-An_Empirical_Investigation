The neon glow of the "Open 24/7" sign painted streaks across Eleanor Vance's tired face. Her reflection in the dusty coffee shop window was blurry, obscured by the thick fog rolling in off the river.  She rubbed her eyes, trying to clear the sleep that clung stubbornly to them. Another all-nighter, fueled by caffeine and sheer stubbornness. 

Eleanor, a software developer for a rapidly growing gaming company called "Pixel Forge," had been wrestling with a particularly nasty bug for the past three days. A labyrinthine tangle of code in their new VR experience, "Echoes of Eternity," had refused to cooperate.  The deadline loomed, threatening to crush her and everyone else on the project under its weight. 

Outside, the fog swirled around the dilapidated building, a symphony of whispers against the glass. The only other sounds were the rhythmic tapping of Eleanor's fingers on her keyboard and the distant hum of traffic. Her apartment was just down the street, but she couldn't face the bleak emptiness waiting for her there. Not yet.  

Not until this bug, this insidious monster of code, finally lay defeated at her feet.
