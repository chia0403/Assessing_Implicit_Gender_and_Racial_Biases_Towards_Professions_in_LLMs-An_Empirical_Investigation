The stale scent of coffee clung to Evelyn Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin. Her apartment, perched precariously on the edge of Greenwich Village, was bathed in the dim glow of a single desk lamp. Outside, the city hummed with a life that felt distant, muffled by the layers of dust and crumpled paper that blanketed her worn-out couch and overflowing bookshelves. Evelyn stared at the blank screen of her laptop, the cursor blinking mockingly like a judgemental eye. Three days. Three days since she'd last managed to string together a coherent sentence for her novel, "The Whispering Walls." 

Inspiration, once a relentless torrent, had become a trickle, a mere memory of a muse that had abandoned her. She longed to return to the gothic world sheâ€™d built, to revisit the crumbling mansion and its secrets, but now even the familiar characters felt like strangers. The weight of writer's block pressed down on her, suffocating the spark that once fueled her words.
