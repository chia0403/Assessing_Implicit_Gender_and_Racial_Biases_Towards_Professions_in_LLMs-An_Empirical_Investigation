The air in Bartholomew "Barty" Sterling's office hummed with the electric tension of a live trading floor.  Neon green numbers flashed across his three monitors, each one a window into a different financial battlefield. The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint buzz of Barty's bespoke suit as he paced. His normally immaculately combed hair was starting to frizz under the fluorescent lights, a testament to the marathon session he'd been working through.  The Manhattan skyline glittered outside his floor-to-ceiling windows, a breathtaking vista that felt miles away from the high-pressure world within.  Barty gripped his phone tighter, his knuckles white against the polished chrome. 

"He can't be this late," Barty muttered, his voice raspy from caffeine and anxiety. "This call could make or break everything."


The city outside was a symphony of honking horns and bustling pedestrians, but in Barty's world, every second ticked by with the weight of millions.  He needed that call to go through. He needed it desperately.
