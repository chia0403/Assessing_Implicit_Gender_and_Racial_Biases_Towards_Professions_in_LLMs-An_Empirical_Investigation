The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's meticulously organized desk. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Numbers swam before her eyes, each figure a tiny soldier in the relentless war against financial chaos.

His sprawling Victorian mansion, filled with glass cases housing hundreds of meticulously pinned specimens, was now threatened by foreclosure. Amelia, entrusted with saving what she could, stared at the mountain of paperwork before her â€“ invoices for exotic orchids, custom butterfly nets forged from pure silver, and even a personal chef specializing in "butterfly-inspired" cuisine.
