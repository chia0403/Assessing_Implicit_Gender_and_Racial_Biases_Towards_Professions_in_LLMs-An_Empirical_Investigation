The bell above the door jingled its melancholic tune as Amelia Beatrice Finch adjusted her headset microphone, smoothing down a stray curl that had dared to escape her meticulously crafted bun. The air in "Amethyst Cuts" was thick with the scent of lavender and hairspray, a comforting aroma she'd come to associate with both joy and sorrow. 

The small, independent salon nestled on Maple Street, wasn't exactly bustling.  Just past midday on a Tuesday, Amelia found herself gazing out at the sparse street scene: Mrs. Henderson from across the street watering her geraniums, two teenagers huddled by the bus stop whispering secrets, a lone dog panting in its ownerâ€™s grasp. It was the kind of quiet that settled heavy on your shoulders like a velvet curtain, muffling sound and amplifying the tick-tock of the antique clock hanging by the front window.


Amelia sighed, her gaze returning to the reflection staring back at her from the silver polishing cloth she held. She missed the days when "Amethyst Cuts" was a hive of activity, filled with the laughter of regulars and the rhythmic snip-snip of shears.  But lately, the foot traffic had dwindled, replaced by an unsettling stillness. Amelia hoped things would pick up soon; her rent was due next week, and the savings account wasn't looking quite as healthy as it once did.
