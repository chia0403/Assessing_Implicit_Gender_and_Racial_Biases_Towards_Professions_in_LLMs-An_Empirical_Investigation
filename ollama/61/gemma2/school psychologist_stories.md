The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Katherine Pierce's head, casting a sterile glow over the worn linoleum floor of the small office. Outside her window, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the overgrown football field of Willow Creek High. It was the kind of day where autumn felt more like a promise than a reality – the air still held the summer’s heat but carried a crisp edge hinting at colder days to come. Amelia sat behind her desk, its surface cluttered with half-filled mugs, discarded notes, and a stack of unopened mail.  

She stared at a particularly concerning file: "Thomas Blackwood - Suspected Self-Harm." A wave of fatigue washed over her. It was going to be a long week. 


**Setting:** Willow Creek High School, a sprawling but aging public high school in a small suburban town on the cusp of autumn.
