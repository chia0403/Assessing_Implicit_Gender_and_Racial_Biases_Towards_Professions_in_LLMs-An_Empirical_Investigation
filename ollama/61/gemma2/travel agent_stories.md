The aroma of jasmine tea mingled with the scent of old parchment and leather-bound novels in Amelia Rose Thorne's tiny office. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air like fairy dust. Outside, the bustling city of Barcelona roared to life, its energy a stark contrast to the serene haven Amelia had carved out for herself amidst the chaos. She surveyed her domain with quiet pride: maps pinned haphazardly on corkboards, stacks of travel brochures piled high, and a vintage globe resting regally in the corner, its faded colours whispering tales of distant lands. 

Amelia, a woman whose spirit echoed the vibrant hues of a hand-painted Moroccan tile, thrived on weaving dreams into reality. Her job wasn't just booking flights and hotels; it was crafting bespoke adventures, tailoring journeys to each client's unique desires. Today, however, she faced her most peculiar request yet - a call from a man claiming his dream was to disappear.
