The fluorescent lights hummed above Miss Amelia Thistlewick's head, their pale glow casting everything in the classroom into an uninspiring yellow.  Crayons littered the floor, a casualty of the afternoon art project – paper plate sunflowers that were more abstract expressionism than botanical accuracy. The remnants of snacks stuck to desks and the lingering scent of glue mingled with the stale air, making Amelia's nose wrinkle.

She glanced at the clock – 3:15. Only fifteen minutes until freedom. Fifteen minutes before she could escape the cacophony of seven-year-olds who were currently engaged in a heated debate about the proper pronunciation of "dinosaur." A familiar weariness settled over her, but it was a tiredness that came with love, not disdain. This classroom, despite its chaos and constant demands, felt like hers. It was a small world she'd built, brick by tiny brick, filled with curious minds and boundless energy. 


It wasn't always easy, being Miss Amelia Thistlewick, third grade teacher at Maplewood Elementary. But then again, what ever truly easy about shaping young minds?
