The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and chimney smoke as Eleanor Persephone Finch adjusted her crisp linen blouse.

Her tour group, a motley crew of retirees, honeymooners, and solo travelers, buzzed with anticipation.

She knew every nook and cranny of this enchanting labyrinth, and today, she would weave its magic for her eager audience.
