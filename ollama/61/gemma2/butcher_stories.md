The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood's shop was thick with the scent of iron and rosemary. It wasn't an unpleasant smell, not to him at least. It was the familiar perfume of hard work, of life given and taken, of transformation. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the rows of glistening carcasses hanging from the hooks, their pale flesh catching the light like polished bone.  

Bart stood behind the counter, his weathered hands carefully slicing a thick slab of pork belly. His apron was stained with years of blood and fat, a testament to his dedication to his craft. He moved with practiced efficiency, humming a tuneless melody under his breath as he worked. The shop itself was a relic of another time - wood-panelled walls lined with antique tools, the floor perpetually sticky with a mixture of sawdust and spilled marrow.  

Outside, the cobblestone street of Hogsmeade hummed with activity. Children chased each other past the butcher's window, their laughter echoing through the narrow lanes. The air was alive with the sounds of bartering and gossip, the scent of baking bread mingling with Bart's own aromatic shop. But inside, it was a sanctuary - a world unto itself, governed by the rhythm of the cleaver and the murmur of whispered prayers for a good cut.  

This was Bartholomew Blackwood's domain, his kingdom of meat and bone, where he ruled with a firm hand and a kind heart.  At least, that's how it had always been... until today.
