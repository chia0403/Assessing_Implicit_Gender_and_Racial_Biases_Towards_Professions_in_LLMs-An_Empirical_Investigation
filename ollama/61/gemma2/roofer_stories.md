The Arizona sun beat down on Elias “Eli” Calderon's neck, making his brow sweat even before he reached for the hammer. He squinted at the sprawling ranch house before him, its terracotta tiles shimmering in the heat like a mirage. Eli ran a hand over his salt-and-pepper beard, feeling the sting of grit embedded from the previous day’s job.  This was going to be another scorcher, but Eli knew better than to complain. This wasn't just any job; this was Mrs. Delacroix's roof. 

Mrs. Delacroix, a sharp-tongued widow who could out-bluff a rattlesnake, had been demanding repairs for months. Her threats of calling the "Roofing Review" - a local blog with an unforgiving readership - had finally spurred Eli into action. Now, perched precariously on the edge of the roof, he surveyed the damage: cracked tiles, exposed mortar, and a gaping hole where a wayward tumbleweed had taken its toll.  Eli sighed. This wasn't just another job; it was a battle against time, the elements, and Mrs. Delacroix herself.
