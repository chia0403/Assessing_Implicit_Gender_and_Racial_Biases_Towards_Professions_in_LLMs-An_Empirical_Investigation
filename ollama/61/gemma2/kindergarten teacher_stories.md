The bell above the door chimed its cheerful little tune as Amelia Rose Butterfield walked into her classroom.  Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating a kaleidoscope of handmade creations: rainbow fish glued to cardboard, construction paper suns with wobbly rays, and tiny clay pots overflowing with plastic flowers. 

Amelia’s classroom at Sunny Meadow Kindergarten was a haven of chaos and creativity. Crayons dotted every surface, glitter sparkled in the air, and the faint scent of glue lingered like a sweet perfume. It was always a whirlwind, but Amelia wouldn't trade it for anything.  She loved watching her little students bloom, learning, laughing, and exploring their world with wide-eyed wonder.


This particular morning, however, something felt different. A knot of unease twisted in Amelia’s stomach as she glanced at the empty cubbies along one wall. Six pairs of tiny shoes were missing. Where were her six new kindergarteners?  Had they been misplaced, forgotten, or worse?  

Amelia's heart pounded in her chest. She took a deep breath and tried to quell the growing anxiety. It was probably nothing, just a simple mix-up. But as she surveyed the room, her unease only intensified.  It felt strangely quiet, devoid of the usual buzz of excited chatter. Something was wrong. 


The morning sunshine seemed to dim, casting long shadows across the floorboards as Amelia cautiously made her way to the empty corner where her six missing students should be.
