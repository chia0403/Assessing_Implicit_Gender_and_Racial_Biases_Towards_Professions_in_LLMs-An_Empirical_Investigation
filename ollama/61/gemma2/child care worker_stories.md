The sticky sweet smell of grape juice hung in the air, mingling with the faint scent of crayon wax and desperation.  Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Thorne surveyed the scene before her: four-year-olds were engaged in an epic battle over a red plastic truck, their tiny faces contorted with fierce determination. A toddler gnawed on a teething ring, his eyes glazed over with sugar-induced bliss. And a lanky preteen named Kevin slouched in the corner, headphones clamped firmly over his ears, seemingly oblivious to the chaos around him.

Amy sighed, pushing her auburn braid behind her ear. This was typical Tuesday afternoon at "Sunshine Daycare," a cramped brick building nestled between a bustling laundromat and a perpetually greasy burger joint on the edge of town.  It wasn't glamorous, but it was hers. Sheâ€™d poured her heart into creating a safe, nurturing space for these kids, each one with their own stories, anxieties, and dreams. 

And today, just like every day, Amy would be there to catch them when they fell, celebrate their victories, and remind them that even amidst the sticky fingers and tantrums, sunshine could always be found.
