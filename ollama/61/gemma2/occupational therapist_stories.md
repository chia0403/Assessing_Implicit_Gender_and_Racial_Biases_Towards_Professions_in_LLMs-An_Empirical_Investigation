The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lemon hand sanitizer that Eleanor Rose Finch perpetually spritzed around herself. Sunlight, filtered through gauzy white curtains, cast stripes across the linoleum floor of the therapy room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the silent space. 

Eleanor, a woman whose perpetually neat bun seemed to defy the chaos inherent in her profession, sat perched on the edge of a sturdy, beige chair. Before her lay a jigsaw puzzle – a chaotic jumble of vibrant pieces depicting a sun-drenched beach scene.  She’d chosen it carefully for Mr. Hayes, a man struggling to regain motor function after a stroke that had robbed him of his independence. But today, as Eleanor waited patiently for him to enter the room, she felt a familiar pang of uncertainty gnawing at her. Would he be receptive? Would he even try?  

Outside the window, the city hummed with its usual cacophony – a stark contrast to the hushed quiet within the therapy room, a microcosm of hope and frustration that Eleanor knew intimately.
