The rusted gears of Bastion Gate groaned like an arthritic dragon as Sergeant Alistair Thorne heaved himself onto the platform. Dawn bled across the horizon, painting the sky in bruised purples and angry oranges, mirroring the storm brewing within him. He squinted at the desolate landscape beyond the gate. A sea of cracked earth stretched before them, scarred by years of relentless sun and unforgiving sand. Twisted skeletons of trees clawed at the leaden sky, their branches brittle reminders of a forgotten world where life once thrived.

Alistair adjusted his breastplate, its metal cold against his clammy skin. The weight of responsibility pressed down on him like the thick, humid air. He was the last line of defense for Havenhold, a ramshackle city clinging to existence amidst this wasteland. His post, Bastion Gate, was more than just a checkpoint; it was a symbol of hope in a world consumed by despair. 


Each day brought whispers of raiders, monstrous creatures, and desperate scavengers seeking refuge within Havenhold's crumbling walls. Today, the wind carried an unfamiliar chill, prickling Alistair's skin with unease. He gripped his halberd tighter, its familiar weight grounding him amidst the rising tide of apprehension.  He wasn't just guarding a city; he was guarding a dream. And dreams were fragile things, easily shattered by the harsh realities of this desolate world.
