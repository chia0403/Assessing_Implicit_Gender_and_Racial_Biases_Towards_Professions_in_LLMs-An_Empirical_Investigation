The humid air hung heavy in Seville, clinging to Esmeralda “Esme” Sánchez like a second skin. She wiped her brow with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of sweat against the vibrant blue of her apron.  Her small salon, "La Peluquería de Esme," was tucked away on a narrow cobbled street, barely visible behind overflowing flower boxes and the ever-present buzz of cicadas.

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of hairspray and jasmine. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, illuminating the worn wooden floor and the rows of brightly coloured bottles lining the shelves. Esme hummed a flamenco tune as she expertly snipped away at Mrs. Rodriguez's unruly curls, her nimble fingers moving with practiced grace.  

Esme was more than just a hair cutter; she was a confidante, a therapist, and sometimes even a life coach for the women who flocked to her salon. They came not only for fresh cuts and vibrant colours but also for Esme's warm smile, sharp wit, and uncanny ability to listen without judgment.  Today, however, something felt different. The usual chatter was subdued, replaced by an air of anxious anticipation. Even Mrs. Rodriguez seemed distracted, her eyes darting nervously towards the door. 

Just as Esme finished trimming Mrs. Rodriguez's bangs, a woman stepped into the salon. She was tall and elegant, with a face that could launch a thousand ships. But it was her eyes, dark and intense, that held Esme captive. There was a story hidden behind them, a story she felt compelled to unravel.
