Rain hammered against the glass facade of Anya Petrova's office, each drop a tiny explosion against the sleek surface. The city outside was a blur of grey and yellow, headlights slashing through the downpour like angry wasps. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and the frustration that had become a constant companion for Anya.
