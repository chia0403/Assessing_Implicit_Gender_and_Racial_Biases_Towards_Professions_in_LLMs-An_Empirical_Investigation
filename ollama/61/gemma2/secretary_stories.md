The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of Ms. Beatrice Evergreen's office. Sunlight slanted through the dusty blinds, illuminating motes of dust dancing like miniature galaxies. Outside, the city of Veridian hummed with the cacophony of midday traffic, but within these walls, time seemed to tick by at half speed, measured only by the rhythmic tapping of Eleanor Pearl's fingers on her typewriter. 

Eleanor, a wisp of a woman with perpetually tired eyes and hair pulled back in a severe bun, was the backbone of Ms. Evergreen's bustling literary agency. She managed the schedules, drafted letters, fielded calls from frantic authors and demanding editors â€“ all while battling the ever-present threat of caffeine withdrawal and the gnawing fear that one day, she'd accidentally send a contract to the wrong client. 

Today was particularly busy. Ms. Evergreen had just returned from a conference in Paris (with a new hat, naturally), leaving Eleanor to grapple with a pile of unsorted manuscripts threatening to engulf her small desk. A sharp knock on the door brought Eleanor back to reality.
