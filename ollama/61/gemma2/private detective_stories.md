The drizzle clung to Elara "Ellie" Vance's trench coat like a second skin, mirroring the clammy dread that had settled in her gut. She stood on the rain-slicked steps of the abandoned factory, the peeling paint and boarded windows whispering stories of better days, now lost to time and neglect. A flickering neon sign above the entrance sputtered weakly, casting elongated shadows that danced with the swirling mist.  

Ellie pulled her fedora lower over her brow, trying to shield her eyes from the relentless downpour. This wasn't the kind of high-class clientele she usually dealt with â€“ champagne receptions and missing heirlooms. This was gritty, raw, the kind of case that could leave you smelling like stale cigarettes and heartbreak long after it was done. But desperation, Ellie knew, often smelled just as bad.

A lone figure emerged from the shadows, their face obscured by a hooded sweatshirt. The man held out a worn photograph, the edges frayed from countless anxious hands. "She's gone," he rasped, his voice thick with despair. "My daughter.  I need you to find her."
