The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Beatrice "Bea" Penelope Harmon's tiny office. Sunlight, fractured by dust motes dancing in the single beam slicing through the grimy window, illuminated rows of overflowing filing cabinets and half-eaten tuna sandwiches on paper plates.  A tattered calendar, its days crossed out with a frantic hand, clung precariously to the wall, reminding Bea that April 15th was looming like a tax-collecting monster.

Bea herself sat hunched over her desk, calculator clutched in one hand and a pair of reading glasses perched on the bridge of her nose. Her brow furrowed as she wrestled with a particularly convoluted Form 1040, muttering under her breath about deductions for "emotional support puppies" and "the joys of cryptocurrency."  

This was Bea's domain: the tax season battlefield, where numbers reigned supreme and sanity often went to die. She was an accountant by trade, but some whispered she was a warrior, a crusader against IRS tyranny, fighting tooth and nail for every last dollar for her clients. This year, however, even Bea felt the pressure mounting. The world seemed on edge, and the air crackled with a sense of impending doom, as if even the tax forms themselves were holding their breath, waiting for something to break.
