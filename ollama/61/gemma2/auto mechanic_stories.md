The grease under Amelia "Amy" Rose's fingernails had practically become a second skin. Years spent hunched over engines, wrestling with rusted bolts and deciphering arcane symbols etched on worn-out parts, had transformed her into an oracle of automotive knowledge. Her domain wasn't some sterile garage in the suburbs, but rather a ramshackle workshop tucked away in the back alleys of New Orleans. The scent of engine oil mingled with the humid air, spiced by the occasional whiff of beignets from the nearby bakery, creating a uniquely pungent atmosphere.  

Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, a steady drumbeat accompanying Amy's methodical work on a vintage Cadillac. This was no ordinary fix; it belonged to Ms. Eloise Dubois, a woman whose stories held more twists and turns than any engine she'd ever encountered. And this time, Ms. Dubois swore her car wasn't simply ailing – it was possessed.  

Amy scoffed internally. Possessed cars were the province of late-night horror shows, not her reality. Yet, as she peered under the hood, a shiver ran down her spine. Something felt…off. The wiring seemed to hum with an unnatural energy, and the engine sputtered like a frightened beast. Maybe Ms. Dubois wasn't crazy after all.
