The morning mist clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's weathered boots as he surveyed Mrs. Davenport's prized rose bushes.  He'd known these blooms since he was a boy, watching them unfurl each spring from the porch of his childhood home across the street. Now, at 42, Bart was entrusted with their care, tasked by Mrs. Davenport herself to keep her garden blooming with the same vibrancy she'd nurtured for decades.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the meticulously manicured lawns of Willow Creek, a quaint suburban neighborhood nestled amongst rolling hills and whispering pines. The air held the scent of freshly cut grass, mingled with the sweet perfume of Mrs. Davenport's roses, a symphony of scents only Bart could truly appreciate.  He ran his calloused hand along the velvet petals of a crimson bloom, knowing each one was a tiny miracle waiting to unfold. But today, something wasn't right. A sickly yellow hue spread across the once vibrant leaves, and a faint tremor ran through the delicate stems. This wasn't just wilting; this was a fight for survival. 


Bart knew Mrs. Davenport depended on her roses. They were more than just flowers; they were memories woven into the fabric of her life. He wouldn't let them fade away without a fight.
