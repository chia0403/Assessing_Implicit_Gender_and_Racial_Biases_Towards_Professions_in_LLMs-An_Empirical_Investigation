The sun bled across the Nevada desert, painting the endless ribbons of asphalt in hues of bruised orange and fiery crimson. A lone tumbleweed skittered across the cracked earth, its journey mirroring the restless spirit of Elias “Ironhand” Blackwood. 

Elias, his calloused hands gripping the worn leather of the steering wheel, squinted at the horizon. His rig, a hulking Peterbilt affectionately nicknamed "The Iron Maiden," hummed like a contented beast beneath him.  He'd been hauling freight across this desolate landscape for over twenty years, and he knew every bump in the road, every lonely diner that served lukewarm coffee and greasy burgers. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced at the edge of his mind, whispering of unseen dangers lurking in the long shadows cast by the setting sun.  


He adjusted his trucker cap, pushing a stray strand of greying hair back from his forehead. It was just the desert playing tricks on him, he told himself. But as he pressed down on the accelerator, The Iron Maiden groaning in response, Elias couldn't shake the feeling that this long haul might be more than just another night under the stars.
