The morning mist clung to the rolling hills of Montana like a whispered secret, obscuring the distant peaks in a veil of gray. Dew sparkled on the long blades of prairie grass, each one trembling with the first breath of wind that stirred through the pasture.  Abigail "Abby" Rosethorn, her weathered face framed by a tangle of sun-bleached hair, stood at the top of the hill, squinting into the haze. The air was crisp and smelled faintly of sagebrush and damp earth. 

Abby's boots crunched on the gravel path as she made her way down to the barn, where the chorus of clucking hens and mooing cows greeted her like old friends. Her ranch, Rosethorn Ranch, had been in her family for generations, passed down from father to daughter like a precious heirloom.  She loved its vastness, its solitude, its raw beauty that spoke to something deep within her soul. But lately, a shadow had fallen over the land, a darkness that threatened to engulf everything she held dear.
