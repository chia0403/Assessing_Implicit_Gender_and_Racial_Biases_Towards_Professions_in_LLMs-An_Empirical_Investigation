The whine of the jackhammer was a familiar lullaby to Daniel Everett "Danny" Hayes. He’d grown accustomed to the vibrations humming through his boots, the dust coating his skin like a second layer, and the smell of damp earth and steel that clung to everything in this perpetually unfinished city.

Danny stood on the precipice of another skyscraper, overlooking a dizzying panorama of concrete canyons under a sky choked by smog. The air was thick with the symphony of construction - clanging metal, rumbling trucks, and shouted orders. But for Danny, it wasn’t just noise; it was a language he understood, a rhythm that marked his days. 


This particular project, "The Pinnacle," as they were calling it, was supposed to be Danny's ticket out. A prestigious address, a hefty paycheck, and maybe, just maybe, enough saved up to finally buy that little cottage by the lake he’d dreamt about for years.  But as Danny tightened his safety harness and gazed out at the endless expanse of steel beams stretching towards the clouds, a flicker of unease crept into his heart. 


There was something off about this building, something more than just the usual headaches and blisters that came with the job. He couldn't put his finger on it, but it felt like they were climbing higher than any building had a right to be. And somewhere, deep down, Danny thought maybe reaching for the sky wasn’t always a good idea.
