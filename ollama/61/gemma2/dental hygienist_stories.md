The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and peppermint as Amelia Pearl Thorne meticulously scraped plaque from Mr. Henderson's molars. Outside, the sun beat down on the sleepy town of Harmony Creek, casting long shadows that stretched across the quaint brick storefronts lining Main Street. Inside Harmony Creek Dental, however, it was a different world. The whirring of drills and the gentle hiss of suction tools filled the air, punctuated by Amelia's soft, reassuring voice as she chatted with Mr. Henderson about his recent fishing trip. 

Harmony Creek wasn't exactly buzzing with excitement, but for Amelia, it was home. She knew every customer by name, their dental history, and often their favourite flavour of toothpaste. The office felt like a comforting, familiar haven, even on days when patients complained about cavities or gum disease.  But today felt different. A nervous flutter danced in Amelia's stomach, making her grip the scaler a little tighter than usual. Mr. Henderson was leaving soon, and with his departure came the unsettling silence that always followed each appointment. 


It was then that she noticed it - a faint whiff of lavender mixed with something metallic, like old blood. It wasn't strong enough to pinpoint, but it lingered in the air, sending a chill down Amelia's spine. She glanced around, her gaze settling on the newly installed security system cameras. 


Was it just her imagination? Or was something amiss in Harmony Creek Dental?
