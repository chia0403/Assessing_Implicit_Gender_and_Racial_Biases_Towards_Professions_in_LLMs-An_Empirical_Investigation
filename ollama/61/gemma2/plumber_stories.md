The insistent drip-drip-drip echoed through the otherwise silent house like a metronome counting down to disaster. Amelia "Amy" Beatrice O'Malley, her toolbox slung over one shoulder, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye. The source of the problem – a leaky faucet in the master bathroom – was nothing new for her.  

But this wasn't just any leaky faucet. This belonged to Mrs. Eleanor Winthrop, the most notorious recluse on Maple Street. Mrs. Winthrop, known for her sharp tongue and even sharper garden shears, hadn’t let anyone into her home for years. Not since the unfortunate incident involving the missing cat and a very angry gardener. 

Amy shivered despite the warmth of the summer day. The house itself felt oppressive, shrouded in layers of dust and silence. Ivy crept up the walls like skeletal fingers, reaching for the dusty windows that stared back blankly. A faint scent of lavender hung heavy in the air, both comforting and unsettling.

This was going to be interesting.
