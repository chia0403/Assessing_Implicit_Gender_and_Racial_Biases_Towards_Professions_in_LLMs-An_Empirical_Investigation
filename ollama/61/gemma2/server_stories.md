The air hung thick with the scent of sizzling garlic and the murmur of half-hearted conversations. The checkered tablecloth beneath Eleanor Rosalind Beaumont’s hands vibrated slightly with each boisterous laugh from the table in the corner.  Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, expertly balanced a tray laden with steaming plates of pasta, her practiced smile never wavering despite the insistent throbbing in her lower back. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the bustling Italian restaurant, “Bella Luna,” bathing the worn wooden booths and red-checked floors in a warm, orange glow. Outside, the streets of Brooklyn buzzed with activity, the symphony of car horns and distant sirens a constant backdrop to Ellie’s evening. But inside, Bella Luna was a world unto itself, filled with the comforting aromas of home cooking and the bittersweet melody of human connection. Tonight, however,  something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, like an approaching storm cloud, prickled at Ellie's skin.
