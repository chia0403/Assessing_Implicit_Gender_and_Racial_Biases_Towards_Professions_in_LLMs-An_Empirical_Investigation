The asphalt shimmered under the relentless Arizona sun, radiating heat that danced off Brenda Mae Delacroix's weathered face.  She wiped the sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand, leaving a smear of grime across her forehead. Brenda Mae squinted at the endless ribbon of highway stretching before her, the only movement a blur of dust kicked up by the occasional passing truck. 

The Mojave Desert stretched around her like a vast, thirsty mouth, swallowing everything in its path. The air was thick with the smell of creosote and gasoline, a pungent reminder that civilization existed just beyond this desolate landscape. Brenda Mae's job was to keep that ribbon of asphalt flowing, patching cracks and potholes, a tireless guardian against the relentless assault of sun, sand, and steel.  

She adjusted her hard hat and took another swig from her lukewarm thermos, its metal cold against her palm. Today, like every day, was just another mile marker on the road to nowhere. Or so she thought.
