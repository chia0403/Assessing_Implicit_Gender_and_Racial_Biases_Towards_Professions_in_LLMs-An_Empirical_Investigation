Sunlight streamed through the leaves of the ancient oak that stood sentinel over Amelia Thistlewick’s farm, casting dappled patterns on the rows of sunflowers straining towards the sky. A gentle breeze rustled the cornstalks, whispering secrets to the plump pumpkins nestled at their base.

Amelia, her hands calloused and dirt-streaked from a morning spent weeding the zucchini patch, wiped the sweat from her brow with the back of her hand. She surveyed her land, a tapestry of vibrant greens and yellows punctuated by splashes of crimson and orange. It was a picture of bountiful harvest, yet a knot of unease tightened in Amelia’s stomach. The past few weeks had been unusually hot, the rain scarce. A shiver ran down her spine despite the summer heat. Something wasn’t right.

It was a place where life moved at a slower pace, governed by the rhythm of the seasons and the whisper of the wind. But lately, even the whispering wind seemed to carry an undercurrent of worry.
