The neon pulse of "Open 24/7" cast long, flickering shadows across Amelia Celeste’s desk. Her apartment, perched precariously above a bustling diner in downtown Chicago, felt more like a creative battleground than a sanctuary. Empty coffee mugs lined the windowsill, alongside crumpled sketches and discarded design concepts that resembled abstract expressionism more than marketing collateral.  

Amelia rubbed her bloodshot eyes, staring at the computer screen. The deadline loomed – 3:00 am and still no inspiration for the new campaign for "Taste Buds", a struggling artisanal pickle company. It was supposed to be simple: “Get pickled with Taste Buds!” But something wasn’t clicking.  

The rhythmic clatter of dishes from downstairs provided an unsettling soundtrack to her frustration. Amelia sighed, pushing away the laptop. Maybe a walk would help clear her head. At least the Chicago night was alive with possibility, even at this ungodly hour.
