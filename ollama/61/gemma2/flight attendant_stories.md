The Boeing 747 rumbled like a slumbering dragon, its engines sighing with exertion as it battled turbulence over the Atlantic. Inside, amongst the symphony of cabin chatter and clinking cutlery, Amelia Beatrice Croft expertly navigated the galley, her movements swift and practiced.  

Amelia, or Amy as most passengers knew her, had seen enough storms to know this one was nothing extraordinary. Years spent soaring above the clouds had taught her patience, resilience, and a deep understanding of human nature – the anxieties that manifested in fidgeting hands, nervous laughter, and furrowed brows when faced with even minor gusts. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the plush carpet, turning the first-class cabin into a dimly lit haven of calm.  Passengers sipped champagne, nibbled on canapés, and gazed out at the swirling tapestry of clouds below, unaware that a storm was brewing in a different part of the world – one that would soon irrevocably change Amelia's life.
