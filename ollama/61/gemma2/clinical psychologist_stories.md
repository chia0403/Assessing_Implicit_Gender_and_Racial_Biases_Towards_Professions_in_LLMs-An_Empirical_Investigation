The rain lashed against Dr. Eleanor Vance’s office window, mimicking the turmoil brewing within her own mind. Outside, Seattle was cloaked in a perpetual twilight, the sky a bruised purple canvas bleeding into the churning grey of the sea. Inside, the familiar scent of lavender and old books hung heavy in the air, a comforting anchor amidst the storm raging both outside and within. 

Eleanor, tall and lean with a cascade of unruly auburn hair perpetually escaping its confines, sat hunched over her desk, staring at the file before her: "Patient - Anonymous." It was an unusual request – complete anonymity for a client seeking therapy – but Eleanor had agreed, driven by a gnawing curiosity and a flicker of empathy she couldn't explain.  
 
She ran a hand through her hair, feeling the tension knotting in her shoulders. This wasn’t just another session; it was a puzzle box begging to be opened. Who was this anonymous patient, and what dark secret were they desperate to unearth?
