Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Spa like a thousand tiny fists pounding a weary heart. Inside, Amara "Amy" Nguyen meticulously prepped a client's table for her Swedish massage session, humming softly to herself as she adjusted the warm lavender pillow and smoothed down a crisp linen blanket. The scent of eucalyptus oil filled the air, a comforting contrast to the cacophony outside. 

It was a Friday evening, usually the busiest night in Amy's small, cozy spa nestled away in a bustling city neighborhood. But tonight, it felt eerily empty. Even the rhythmic clinking of the teacups on the countertop seemed off-kilter under the dim lights of the room. A sense of unease settled over her like damp cotton. 

The silence was broken only by the creak of floorboards and the distant sigh of the wind, amplified by the closed windows. Amy glanced at the clock - almost midnight. There was a distinct lack of typical "weekend rush" traffic in this part of town, which felt unusually quiet for even a Friday night. Just another strange quirk of the storm, she thought, trying to reassure herself. 

But something wasn't quite right.  A sense of wrongness lingered in the air, an unseen thread tugging at Amy's frayed nerves. It was just the kind of premonition that haunted her as a massage therapist - a feeling like she was standing on the precipice of something significant yet unseeable.
