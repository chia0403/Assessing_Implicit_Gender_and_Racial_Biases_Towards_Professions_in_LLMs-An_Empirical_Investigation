The rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Bell's clinic like a thousand tiny fists pounding on glass.  Amelia stared out, her reflection barely visible through the downpour. The only warmth in the room was emanating from the antique oil stove that powered the antiquated heating system – a relic from a time when doctors didn’t need to worry about the flu season and its inevitable wave of coughing patients. 

She adjusted her thick wool coat as she moved towards the waiting area, where a smattering of concerned faces huddled on mismatched chairs. A stray dog whined softly from behind a worn leather couch, its tail tucked between its legs like a forlorn metronome. Amelia sighed, her fingers tapping against the worn wood of the desk in front of her.  

"Good evening, folks," she chirped with forced cheerfulness. "You're all welcome." 
 
The setting was small, nestled on the edge of a quiet town surrounded by rolling hills and fields, its charm overshadowed only by the persistent rain that seemed to have seeped into the very bones of the place.  But today, Amelia knew this place would be more familiar than ever – each sniff, every cough, each whimper resonated with memories of a life she had built, one fur coat at a time.  And tonight, with another storm brewing on the horizon, Amelia found herself hoping that even amidst the chaos, some semblance of warmth and hope could still be found.
