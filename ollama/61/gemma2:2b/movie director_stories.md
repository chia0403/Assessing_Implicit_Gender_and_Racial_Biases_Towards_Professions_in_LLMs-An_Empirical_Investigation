## Opening

Rain lashed against the Parisian windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the Eiffel Tower into an abstract tapestry of colour. Inside, Amelia Dubois’s cluttered studio felt like a museum dedicated to dreams – half-finished scripts, stacks of film reels, and dusty props from forgotten stories coexisted with her ever-expanding collection of vintage film cameras. Amelia was at her desk, surrounded by scattered sketches for her latest project - a noir thriller about a struggling artist who finds love in the most unexpected place. A sigh escaped her lips as she ran a hand through her auburn hair, already battling fatigue and a gnawing sense of creative stagnation. She was on the cusp of something monumental, but the elusive spark that would ignite it seemed to have vanished into the Parisian haze. 

**Character:** Amelia Dubois

**Setting:** A cramped, cluttered apartment above a vintage bookstore in Montmartre, Paris. The air hung thick with the smell of coffee and old ink.  The windows offer stunning views of the Eiffel Tower, yet rain continues to fall incessantly outside.
