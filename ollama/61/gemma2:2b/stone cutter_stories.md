## The Whispering Stone

The rhythmic clang of hammer on granite filled the air, echoing off the cavernous walls of Eldara’s workshop.  Dust motes danced in the waning light that filtered through the dusty skylight, illuminating the worn faces of tools and the intricate patterns etched into a block of basalt. 
It was here, in this dimly lit haven tucked away in the heart of the ancient city of Ascendon, that Elara spent his days.  For decades he had toiled as a stone cutter, shaping the raw earth into exquisite carvings. Each piece held a story within its rough-hewn contours – tales of battles fought and lost, of love stories whispered through the ages. 

Elara's workshop smelled like aged wood, granite dust, and something faintly metallic – a scent he attributed to his grandfather’s secret blend of mineral oils used in smoothing his stonework.  As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across his workbench, Elara’s gaze fell on the newest piece of work - an intricately carved dragon's skull, its jaw agape as if it had screamed one last time before being silenced by the stone itself. 

The air grew thick with a strange hum, almost imperceptible at first, then growing louder and more insistent.  A chill crept across Elara’s spine. Something was amiss. Not just in the workshop, but in the very air he breathed.  It wasn't fear that gripped him, but something akin to anticipation, like the beginning of a story yet to be written. The silence before the storm.
