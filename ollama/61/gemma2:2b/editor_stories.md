Rain lashed against the arched window in Amelia Finch’s cramped Brooklyn office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart as she read through the manuscript for the seventh time. The title, “Echoes of Empire,” was a cruel reminder of the gilded cage that this job had become.  She was an editor at “Literary Lantern”, a once-promising but now floundering publication struggling to stay afloat. 

Amelia’s fingers flew across her keyboard, deleting words with a practiced ease honed by years of battling the vagaries of human emotion and flawed prose. The protagonist, Ethan Blackwood, was a young historian whose latest discovery - a hidden diary from a long-forgotten Mughal emperor – promised to unravel a century of historical secrets. Yet, every time Amelia read it, she found herself more frustrated than enthralled by the manuscript’s predictable melodrama, its characters as flat and lifeless as the worn leather armchair in her corner.

The air hung thick with damp paper and unspoken dreams as Amelia stared at the manuscript. It was a familiar feeling - one of creative stagnation coupled with mounting financial insecurity. A storm raged outside, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her. 


**Setting:**  A cramped, pre-war brick apartment building in Brooklyn, New York City. The building is old, its hallways damp and dark. The windows are large and arched, offering a view of the rain that pounds against them.
