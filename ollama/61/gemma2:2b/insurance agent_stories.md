The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and stale optimism in Arthur Finch's small, cluttered office. It was the kind of place you only found yourself in when you needed to be close enough to the existential angst to get your soul saved from the abyss through a carefully worded policy. A man named Arthur could only hope that his clients' misery had a better chance at insurance coverage than his own dreary outlook on life.  The clock ticked relentlessly, each second adding another nail to the coffin of what was left of his career daydreaming about a life less ordinary. 

Arthur Finch, though he’d been known in the past as “Finch” and then just "the guy", was an insurance agent.  He dealt with the everyday tragedies of human life – car accidents, accidental fires, broken hearts (and sometimes, the sudden loss of an entire dog). But today, he felt adrift. Arthur stared out the dusty window, watching a downpour wash away the last remnants of hope clinging to his once vibrant career.

**Setting:** A small, run-down office building on the outskirts of a bustling city.  Arthur's desk is overflowing with files and insurance brochures, some dating back decades, each holding the memories of broken dreams and forgotten tragedies.
