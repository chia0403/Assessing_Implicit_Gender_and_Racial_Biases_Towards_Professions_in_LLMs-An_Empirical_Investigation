The Arizona sun hammered down on Silas "Stonehand" McArthur's back as he shifted his weight in the cab of the 50-ton bulldozer.  Dust devils danced across the ochre plains, swirling around the behemoth's massive blades like tiny tornadoes. He squinted through the heat haze, his weathered face creased in a familiar frown. This was nothing new; this was how it always felt on the vast emptiness of the McArthur Ranch. But today, the usual silence felt oddly oppressive. The foreman, Jebediah "Jeb" Taylor, had been unusually quiet all morning, the worry lines etching deeper into his usually jovial face as he watched Silas work the last stretch of the irrigation ditch. 

**Setting:** The McArthur Ranch is a sprawling, family-owned farm located in central Arizona. It's known for its vast open plains and the endless desert landscape stretching for miles around. The ranch has seen generations of work and hardship, and the air hums with an ancient energy that feels both familiar and unsettling.

**Character:** Silas "Stonehand" McArthur is a seasoned heavy equipment operator who carries on the family tradition of maintaining the vast lands.  He's weathered, scarred from years in the saddle, but with calloused hands and eyes that hold both grit and a quiet wisdom honed by decades spent shaping the land.
