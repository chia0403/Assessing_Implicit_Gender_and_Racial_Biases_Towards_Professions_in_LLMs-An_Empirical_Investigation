The humid air hung thick as a wet blanket over Arcturus's workshop, clinging to his worn overalls and leaving sweat stinging his eyes.  His fingers danced deftly across the worn mahogany table, tracing delicate lines on a blueprint – lines that would eventually become reality, bridges spanning impossibly vast gaps in the earth. The blueprints were his only companions in this cavernous corner of the bustling city, far from the din and cacophony of street life. His name was Arcturus Thorne, and for him, drawing was not just work; it was a language to be spoken with gravity and precision.

Arcturus's workshop was an unexpected oasis amidst the concrete jungle.  His workspace boasted no fluorescent lights but instead relied on the comforting warmth of kerosene lamps and the gentle glow of oil-rubbed brass stencils.  The walls were lined with shelves stacked high with books – a testament to Arcturus's encyclopedic knowledge of bridges, his fingers constantly flipping through their pages to find answers hidden within archaic tomes. Even amidst this seemingly timeless haven, Arcturus felt the weight of time pressing against him like the ever-increasing deadlines on his table. He was a man of immense talent trapped in a world that didn't seem to understand his art, let alone appreciate it.  The only solace he found was in the rhythmic hum of steel against steel, the satisfying clink as he assembled his models – each bridge a small monument to his dreams and aspirations.
