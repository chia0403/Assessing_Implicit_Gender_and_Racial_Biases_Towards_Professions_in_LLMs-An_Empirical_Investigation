The late afternoon sun slanted through the shop window, casting the polished chrome of the hairdryer in an almost otherworldly glow.  Inside "The Mane Event," Amelia Thorne stood behind her station, surrounded by the familiar symphony of shears and hairdryers, a fragrant cloud of hairspray hanging in the air like wispy promises. 

Amelia was known as much for her perfectly executed bobs as she was for her infectious giggle - the kind that could charm even the grumpiest client into sharing their deepest secrets about their lives, all while leaving them looking fantastically refreshed.  The shop itself hummed with a quiet energy; soft jazz playing in the background and the rhythmic whir of styling tools filling the space.  Outside, the city lights pulsed like a heartbeat, beckoning Amelia to finish her last appointment before she closed up for the night, ready to slip into her cozy apartment where dreams of fresh pastries and a good movie awaited. 

But tonight, something felt different. Tonight, the usual comforting hum seemed muted, replaced by a strange, almost electric tension in the air.  Maybe it was the new client - Mrs. Henderson, who had been seen at every salon for decades, always with her signature black curls bouncing down her back and that unmistakable frown etched onto her face.
