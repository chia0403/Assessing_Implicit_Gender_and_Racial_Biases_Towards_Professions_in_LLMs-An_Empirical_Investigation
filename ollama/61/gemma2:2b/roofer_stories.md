The wind whipped off Lake Michigan, carrying with it the salty tang of storm clouds and the sharp edge of winter's coming.  Rain splattered on Elias Thorne's face as he climbed his ladder, muscles screaming in protest after hours spent hauling heavy shingles under unforgiving conditions.  His worn boots clung to the slick wood of the rickety scaffold, its creaking a constant soundtrack to the relentless symphony of nature. He was perched high above the sprawling Victorian mansion, the massive chimney of Mr. Blackwood's home puffing a plume of grey smoke into the sky – a testament to the dying embers of autumn's warmth. 

Elias wasn’t a man for fancy words or sentimentality, but he couldn’t help feeling a pang of bittersweet nostalgia as the last rays of daylight bled across his canvas.  He had grown up amidst these stormy skies, watched them paint the horizon in shades of grey and indigo for his entire life. This house – its faded grandeur and whispering tales of forgotten summers - held an undeniable power over him, even if he’d never admit it to anyone.
