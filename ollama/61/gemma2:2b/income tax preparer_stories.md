## The Taxman Cometh

Rain pattered against the warped glass of the office window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia "Amy" Winthrop's mind as she stared at the mountain range of paperwork on her desk.  It wasn’t just any mountain range – it was a jagged skyline of tax returns, each one a testament to the year's struggles and triumphs for the families who entrusted Amy to navigate their financial labyrinth.

The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sterile white glare that didn't quite capture the warm chaos of the room. This was the corner office in her small but beloved accounting firm – "Winthrop & Sons" –  where she spent her days as a tax preparer and confidante. 

Amy sighed, pushing back a stray strand of brown hair that had escaped its bun. It was January, usually a time for new beginnings, but this year, the air was thick with an unsettling weight. The economy felt fragile, like a finely-tuned machine on the brink of failure. And as she sifted through forms and receipts, the weight seemed to settle deeper within her. 

The tax season had officially begun, and every tick of the clock brought a new wave of clients – each one a reminder of the precariousness of their financial situations. It was time for the storm to break, for Amy's carefully-prepared umbrella to be tested by the relentless winds of the IRS.  And though she knew the challenges were daunting, there was something in her heart that refused to surrender - an unwavering belief that with careful planning and a little bit of human ingenuity, they could weather any storm.

It introduces the setting (her accounting firm) and provides some insight into her character – she's intelligent, resourceful, but also empathetic.
