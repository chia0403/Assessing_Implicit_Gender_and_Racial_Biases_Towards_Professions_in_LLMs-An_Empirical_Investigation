The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Edgar "Eagle" Callahan's head, casting sickly yellow beams on the linoleum floor of the Grand Majestic Hotel. It was an ironic name for the place, given its faded grandeur and air of disuse. The grand lobby, once bustling with guests in tuxedos and evening gowns, now stood silent except for the occasional creak of a neglected elevator or the rustle of a stray pigeon scavenging crumbs from a forgotten buffet table. Eagle knew this symphony of silence like the back of his hand – 20 years spent as janitor had instilled him with an uncanny familiarity with every floorboard groan and flickering lightbulb's sigh. 

Today, however, something felt different. A whisper of unease settled in Eagle’s gut as he pushed past a dusty velvet curtain that concealed a grand staircase, the faded gilt lettering barely visible beneath layers of dust. He had swept under this very stairwell countless times before, but today, the silence was heavy with an unseen presence.  A cold draft snaked through the air, sending goosebumps crawling across his skin. 

Eagle's hand instinctively went to the worn leather strap of his toolbox, a familiar comfort in an unnerving moment. The Grand Majestic held secrets, whispers of forgotten stories and long-dead dreams clinging to every corner. And Eagle, with his quiet strength and unwavering loyalty to the place, was the one who listened, the one who saw the ghosts dancing between reality and shadow.
