Rain hammered against the cracked asphalt of Elm Street like a thousand tiny fists, each punch resonating through Detective Liam Callahanâ€™s bones.  He hunched deeper into his trench coat, a flimsy shield against the wind and the pervasive chill that seemed to permeate even his thick-soled boots. The flickering streetlamp cast long, distorted shadows across the graffiti-tagged brick walls of the abandoned warehouse. It was a fitting backdrop for the case that had consumed him for weeks: a missing person, a local drug kingpin, and a trail leading to the heart of this city's underbelly. 

Liam had sworn an oath to protect his city, but lately it felt like protecting them all was too much of a burden.  He glanced at his reflection in the puddle left by the last burst of rain on the pavement - tired eyes framed by a stubborn five o'clock shadow. Another night, another dead end. He ran a hand through his dark hair, a gesture that felt foreign and unfamiliar. Tonight wasn't about the case; it was about finding a sliver of hope in the storm that was engulfing him.  This city had a way of swallowing your soul whole, especially when you were chasing shadows.
