The fluorescent lights hummed a tired symphony as Amelia "Millie" Cartwright scanned a customer's groceries, her forehead creasing with the effort. The air hung thick with the scent of stale popcorn and unfulfilled dreams – typical for the 2:00 am shift at the Corner Stop. Millie loved her job, even amidst the endless cycles of grumpy customers and late-night cravings. It was a routine that kept things predictable; like clockwork, the day would start at precisely 11:59 pm, with the chime of the bell above the door, followed by a barrage of orders. Tonight was no different. 

Millie's shift hadn't been particularly eventful until she saw him – or rather, felt him – in the reflection of the cashier's screen. A man stood just beyond the scanner area, shrouded in shadows, yet his silhouette burned brighter than the neon green light.  His posture was awkward, a rigid formality that seemed to clash with the haphazard arrangement of grocery bags on the counter. He held a single plastic bag – small, white, and almost translucent – like an offering at a silent shrine.  He didn't say a word. Just stared at her. Millie felt her pulse jump in her chest as she realized he had been watching her this entire shift, his eyes like two black pits in the dimly lit air. 

The bell over the door chimed again. Another customer. A man with a beer and a scowl. "Can I just get my usual?" he barked before Millie could even blink. Millie held back a sigh.  


**Setting:** 
* The Corner Stop - a run-down convenience store operating in an unassuming corner of a quiet suburb, perpetually buzzing with the humdrum life of late night dwellers.
