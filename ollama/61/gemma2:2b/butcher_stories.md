## The Smell of Smoke and Secrets

The air hung thick with the scent of smoke and sawdust. It clung to everything in this old family-run shop, **Wilbur Hawthorne's** Meat Market, as familiar as a lover’s touch. He ran a weathered hand over his wife Evelyn's portrait on the wall, its faded colors swirling into a blur of memories. The butcher block behind him was slick with blood and sweat – tonight's delivery, a pig to the local tavern for their weekly roast, had been...spirited, to say the least. 

Wilbur took solace in the routine. Every day felt like a well-oiled machine, each action precise and deliberate. From cleaving through a side of beef with his grandfather's worn cleaver to wrapping sausages with meticulous care, he was a master of his craft, his hands moving as graceful as the dancers in his wife’s old folk songs. But tonight, there was something else in the air, something that stirred a deep unease within him. 

A shadow lingered by the doorway, cast long and ominous in the dim light filtering through the grimy windows. A man stood outside, cloaked in a long black coat, his face obscured by the gloom. Even with his eyes shielded by the wide brim of his hat, Wilbur could see the glint of steel hidden beneath his gloved hand. 
 
"Mr. Hawthorne?" The voice was low and gravelly, like gravel rolling down a hill. "Time for a little...favor."
