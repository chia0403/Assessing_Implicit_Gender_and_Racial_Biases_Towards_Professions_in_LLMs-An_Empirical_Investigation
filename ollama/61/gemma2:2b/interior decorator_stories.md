## Setting: A Victorian Mansion in Charleston

The humid Carolina air clung to Amelia Hawthorne like a forgotten dream, its salty tang mingling with the scent of magnolia blossoms bursting from overflowing flower boxes lining the porch steps. This was Magnolia Manor, a sprawling, opulent Victorian mansion perched on the harborfront in Charleston. For decades, it had held onto its grandeur, but Amelia, fresh-faced and brimming with optimism, saw only potential for rebirth. Her task:  restore this architectural time capsule to the vibrancy of a bustling seaside life.

Amelia adjusted her floral print apron and wiped the sweat from her brow, taking in the vastness of the room she’d been assigned to for the day. The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the filtered sunlight that poured through the arched windows, illuminating faded velvet furniture adorned with grotesque, hand-carved angels. 

She smoothed down a stack of mismatched chairs and sighed. This was her chance at a true canvas; a symphony of color against the backdrop of a forgotten era. But even Amelia knew there were cracks in this grand facade. This wasn’t just about restoring walls and fabric – it was about breathing life back into the soul of this place, a soul that had faded with time.
