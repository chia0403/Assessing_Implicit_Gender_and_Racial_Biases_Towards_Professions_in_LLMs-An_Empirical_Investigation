The air hung thick with lavender and regret in the grand Gilded Age mansion of Lady Elara Sterling.  It was a scent that usually brought solace to Amelia "Amy" Thorne, but today it only amplified the gnawing feeling of inadequacy churning in her stomach.  She'd been a maid for Elara since she was thirteen, ever since the day Amy’s own father had passed on, leaving her and her younger sister to fend for themselves.  The house – with its sprawling halls, overflowing bookshelves, and exquisite silver cutlery - felt like a gilded cage compared to the simple life she yearned for.  

Today, the weight of Elara's impending divorce hung heavier than usual. The air crackled with unspoken tension, as though Lady Sterling herself were about to combust.  Amy knew this wasn’t just about money – it was about prestige, and the delicate fabric of the Sterling family name was being ripped apart by the seams. And Amy was at the center of it all, tasked with cleaning up the wreckage.
