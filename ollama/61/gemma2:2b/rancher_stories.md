The dust devils danced across the parched prairie like errant spirits, teasing the horizon where the sky met the endless swathe of ochre earth.  "That's just how it always is," Maeve Callahan muttered, running a calloused hand over her weathered face. The wind had picked up in the afternoon, whipping strands of silver hair around her stern, sun-bronzed features. Even after three decades on this land, she still felt it in her bones: the relentless beat of the land's pulse, the unspoken symphony of loss and resilience that echoed through every dry creek bed and weathered fencepost. 

Maeve was a lone wolf on these plains - one of many who had carved their existence from the earth, but none as stubborn or resolute as she. Her cattle grazed listlessly under the merciless glare of the sun, each hoofprint a silent testament to years of relentless toil and enduring grit. They were her legacy, her responsibility, and she clung to them with the fierceness of a lioness defending her cubs. 

The setting sun cast long, grotesque shadows across the valley, stretching the loneliness of Maeve's solitude into an almost palpable entity.  She was all too aware that even the stubborn earth felt the shift, a creeping sense of unease in the very air she breathed.
