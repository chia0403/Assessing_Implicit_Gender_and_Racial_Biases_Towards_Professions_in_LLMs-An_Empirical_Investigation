The air hung thick and heavy with pine needles and damp earth, clinging to Jebediah "Jeb" Hawthorne like a second skin as he trudged through the woods.  He was a man sculpted by the forest itself - lean, tanned from years under the sun, his hands calloused and strong. The smell of sawdust and wet wood always seemed to follow him, a comforting reminder of his lifeâ€™s work. Today, Jeb felt an unusual tension coiled in his gut, not from the climb up the treacherous incline of Mount Evergreen, but something far more unsettling - fear.  

The setting sun cast long shadows over the ancient trees, their massive trunks like giants reaching towards the sky, while a chill settled on the hillside, carrying whispers of approaching storm. Jeb pulled his worn leather jacket closer around him, feeling its meager protection against the creeping cold and unease. His logging crew had been missing for three days now, their last radio contact lost on the same day as the forest's silence fell upon them, broken only by the incessant groan of the ancient trees and the unsettling creak of his own steps on the forest path.
