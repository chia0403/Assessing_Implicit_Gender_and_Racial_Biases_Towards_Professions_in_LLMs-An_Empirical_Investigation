The desert stretched before Bartholomew "Big Bear" Hayes like an angry beast, its endless expanse punctuated only by the skeletal remains of ancient saguaros clinging to life in the unforgiving heat.  Bartholomew's truck, a battered '87 Peterbilt named Betsy, rumbled down Route 66, the same dusty highway that had swallowed countless others before her. The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and creosote as Big Bear navigated the twisting curves, his weathered face shadowed by the brim of his Stetson.  Heâ€™d crossed this desolate stretch a hundred times, each journey a tapestry of sunrise and sunset, endless miles punctuated by lonely diners and roadside bars. But tonight felt different, a gnawing unease clinging to him like an old dust storm.
