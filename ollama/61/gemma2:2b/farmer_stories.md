The wind whipped across Caleb Thorne's worn face, carrying with it the scent of rain and the sharp tang of his own worry. The sun was sinking fast over the horizon, casting long shadows that stretched like grasping fingers onto the weathered fields of Thorne Farms.  His calloused hands clenched around a chipped mug of coffee, steaming black liquid barely clinging to its form against the encroaching chill of the approaching night. 

He stood alone, surveying the parched land with a deep frown etching lines into his already aged face. For weeks now, the earth had stubbornly refused to yield its bounty, and the once-abundant crops were wilting under the merciless sun.  His heart pounded in rhythm with the stubborn throb of worry for his family's future, mirroring the erratic pulse of the dying wheat field just beyond the barn doors. The whispers started again - murmurs about drought, rumors of a failing season, and fear clinging to each word like dust on old straw. Caleb knew he was no match for nature's wrath this time, yet the farm held generations of his family's hopes â€“  and now it seemed as if all those hopes were drying up alongside the wheat. 

He took a deep breath, forcing back the despair that threatened to swallow him whole.  Tonight, he would go beyond the usual prayers and hope for a miracle. Tonight, he would seek answers from somewhere else, from an ancient tradition passed down through his own lineage. He wouldn't give up easily.
