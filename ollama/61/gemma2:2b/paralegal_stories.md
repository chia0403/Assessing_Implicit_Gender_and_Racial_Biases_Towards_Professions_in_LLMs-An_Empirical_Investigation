Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Croft’s cubicle, each drop exploding like tiny fireworks on the grimy glass. It was the kind of storm that brought an unwelcome sense of claustrophobia to even the most seasoned lawyer's office.  Amelia shifted uncomfortably in her chair, the worn fabric groaning beneath her weight. The smell of stale coffee and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar cocktail for anyone who spent their days battling the legal system.

It wasn’t exactly glamorous work, but at least it paid the bills and kept a roof over her head. 

Amelia knew that behind every legal document there was a story – often messy, tangled threads woven into something far more profound than the cold, hard facts she had to sort through.  She just wished she could unravel the complexities of those stories. But as she stared at the case file, all Amelia could think about were the raindrops pounding against the window like a thousand silent accusations, each one echoing her own unspoken fear: what if she never understood the true meaning behind any of these cases?
