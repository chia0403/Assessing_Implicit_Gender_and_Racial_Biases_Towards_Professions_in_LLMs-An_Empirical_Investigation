## The Setting:

The late afternoon sun filtered through the dusty skylights of Hawthorne & Co., casting long shadows on the worn mahogany desks lining the room. A stale scent of old paper and coffee clung to the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of rust from the vintage typewriter that sat sentinel by Mrs. Hawthorne's grand desk in the center of the office. 

The year was 1952, and the once bustling office building on Maple Street now held the hushed melancholy of a forgotten time. The clientele - men in crisp suits and women draped in expensive furs – had all but vanished, leaving only a handful of clerks to maintain the fading grandeur of the place.  

## The Character:

Her name was Eleanor Blackwood, and she was the secretary who kept the gears turning. At 25 years old, Eleanor's world was a symphony of typed letters, memos, and endless cups of black coffee - her only companions in this lonely world. She wore sensible shoes that went from boardroom to afternoon tea with the same ease, and her hair, normally pulled back tight in a bun, always seemed to defy gravity and escape its confines. 


**Opening Scene:**

Eleanor pushed open the heavy oak door of Mrs. Hawthorne's private study.  Dust motes danced in the soft beam of light filtering through the stained glass window. The air hung thick with silence, save for the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner – a silent witness to years gone by. Eleanor adjusted her glasses, taking a deep breath before carefully setting down the stack of letters on Mrs. Hawthorne's mahogany desk.  

"Ms. Blackwood," a soft voice announced from the shadows behind Mrs. Hawthorne's desk. "The Mr. Fitzwilliam is waiting." 


Eleanor straightened her shoulders, a feeling of dread creeping up her spine as she took in the familiar weight of Mrs. Hawthorne's gaze. A faint smile played on her lips, a knowing glint in her eyes, and Eleanor knew – the game was already being played.
