The salty air whipped Agnes' curls around her face as she stood on the pier. Below her, the waves crashed against the weathered wooden planks, each surge echoing the storm brewing inside her. The shop next door, "Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow," was bathed in the soft glow of sunset, its sign flickering like a dying firefly.  Agnes' own salon, tucked away in the heart of the seaside town, felt like a forgotten lighthouse in a sea of anonymity. 

Her name wasn't just Agnes; it was a whisper among the locals - a whisper she’d learned to appreciate and despise in equal measure. “Agnes,” they'd say, each word dripping with both familiarity and disapproval.  “Agnes” was her family legacy, her grandmother's secret recipe for hair-cutting magic, her mother’s gentle hand on a struggling client's shoulder during the hardest of times. But it was also Agnes' prison. 

Today, however, she found herself craving something other than the familiar scent of clipper oil and lavender shampoo that permeated her salon. She wanted a change, a shift in the tides of her life – just like she’d promised her clients after years of patiently cutting their hair into intricate patterns: “Agnes will give you a new style; she'll give you confidence.” 


**Setting:** A quaint seaside town nestled on the edge of a vast ocean.  The year is 1985, and memories linger in every creaky houseboat and faded nautical sign.
