The wind whipped across the desolate stretch of I-80, swirling dust devils around Jebediah "Jeb" Carter's worn pickup truck as he whistled along to a forgotten country song. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and fading lavender, mirroring the melancholy mood that settled over Jeb like the heavy air in his lungs. His calloused hands tightened around the steering wheel as he glanced at the half-empty can of beer cooling under the dashboard light.  He'd been on this stretch for three weeks now, working on the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching into the infinite blue horizon. 

It was a lonely life - miles from civilization, surrounded only by the rumble of trucks, the whine of machinery, and the echoing silence of his own thoughts. He yearned for the warmth of his family back in Kansas, for the scent of fresh-baked cookies his sister would make before his mom's boisterous Sunday dinners.  But there was something oddly comforting about the vast emptiness, a sense of freedom that he wouldn’t find anywhere else.  Jeb wasn't just a highway worker; he was a solitary custodian of this asphalt jungle, ensuring the flow of traffic and keeping order in the face of the endless journey. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he noticed a lone red car parked on the side of the road, its headlights flickering in the gathering darkness.  Jeb’s instincts, honed by years of hard labor and countless late nights under the unforgiving desert sky, screamed at him to be cautious.
