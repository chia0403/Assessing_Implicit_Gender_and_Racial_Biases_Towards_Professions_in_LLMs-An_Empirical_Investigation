Rain pattered against the corrugated roof of the community center like tiny fists punching at the metal.  Inside, sweat beaded on Amelia "Amy" Peterson's forehead as she directed her Zumba class through another round of the salsa routine. The air hung thick with the scent of citrus and the low thrum of music from the speaker system. But instead of the usual vibrant energy that pulsed through Amy's body, a dull ache throbbed behind her right eye.  It had been there all week, ever since she'd tripped on a loose tile during a morning jog. 

The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the room as the class – a motley crew of retirees, young mothers, and eager students – kept their routines going.  Amy noticed Mrs. Olsen, her usual jovial face now clouded with worry, clutching her cane close to her side.  "Slow down, dear," she said in her thick, Swedish accent, "your eyes look like they're about to pop out." 

It wasn't just the ache; it was a feeling of exhaustion that seemed to weigh down even her usual boundless enthusiasm. She forced a smile and winked at Mrs. Olsen.  "Just a bit tired, I guess," she said, hoping to reassure the woman before launching into a new series of steps. 

The setting was: Sunnyside Community Center in the heart of the bustling city of San Francisco. The building, a colorful relic from the 1950s with an outdoor courtyard adorned by blooming sunflowers, housed a vibrant collection of classes catering to every age group and interest. Amy's Zumba class, held on Tuesday evenings, was just one of many that filled the center's calendar year after year.
