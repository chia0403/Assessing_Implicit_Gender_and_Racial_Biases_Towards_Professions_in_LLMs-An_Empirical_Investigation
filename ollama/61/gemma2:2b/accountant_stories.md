## Opening Scene

The fluorescent lights hummed an anxious symphony above Amelia's head, mimicking the frantic beat of her own heart.  Her worn desk chair groaned under its weight as she sat hunched over the ledger, the smell of stale coffee and printer ink clinging to her like a shroud. Her fingers, calloused from years of endless spreadsheets, tapped out a staccato rhythm against the surface, each tap like a tiny hammer driving in despair. 

**Name:** Amelia Thorne
**Setting:** The cramped, beige-walled office of Thorne & Co., a small accounting firm nestled on a quiet side street in Portland, Oregon.  A thick layer of dust covered most furniture, and even the air seemed to hum with a sense of tired resignation. Outside, rain pattered against the windowpanes, a melancholic soundtrack to Amelia's mounting anxiety.


**What follows: **

* Will Amelia find the answers she seeks within the company's books? 
* Is there more to Thorne & Co.'s seemingly mundane existence than meets the eye? 
* Who is the mysterious new client bringing in a wave of unsettling energy, and what secrets are they hiding?
