The humid air hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Thorne like a damp sheet as she waited on the cracked pavement outside the dilapidated apartment building. A buzzing drone vibrated through her hands, mirroring the frantic pulse in her own head. The address was scribbled on a crumpled flyer: 17 Sycamore Lane - known locally as "The Whispering Walls," the site of the city's most notorious unsolved murders. 

Amy, ever the tenacious reporter, had dedicated years to chasing down forgotten truths and buried stories, but this case was different. This wasnâ€™t just another ghost story or a local conspiracy; it was a whispered legend passed down from generation to generation in the decaying neighborhood. The air itself seemed thick with unspoken secrets, a silence heavy enough to physically press against Amy's chest.  As she adjusted her microphone and pulled up her tattered notepad, the promise of a breaking story, however challenging it might be, pulsed like a beacon in the encroaching darkness.  


**Setting:** 
A decaying urban neighborhood in New Orleans with a history steeped in mystery and crime. The building's facade is aged and worn, with peeling paint and boarded-up windows.  Its surroundings are characterized by overgrown foliage, crumbling concrete sidewalks, and an eerie stillness that seems to hold its breath, waiting for something to happen.
