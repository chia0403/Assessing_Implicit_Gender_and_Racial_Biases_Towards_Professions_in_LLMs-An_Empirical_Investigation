The iron gates groaned open like a wounded beast, releasing a pungent wave of salt air and the smell of damp earth.  **Gideon Thorne**, a hulking man carved from granite and steel by years of guarding the keep at the edge of the Whisperwood forest, stood silently before them.  His face, normally set in a permanent scowl, softened slightly as he watched the battered carriage roll down the cobbled path towards the imposing stone archway that marked the entrance to the village of Aethelstone.

The weight of protecting the village was an anchor that dragged him down through each passing day.
