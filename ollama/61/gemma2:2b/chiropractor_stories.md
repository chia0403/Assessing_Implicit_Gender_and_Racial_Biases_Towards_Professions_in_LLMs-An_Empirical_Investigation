The scent of pine needles and old books clung to Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's small clinic in the heart of rural Vermont.  She ran her thumb along the spines of dusty medical texts, each one holding memories of countless back-pain sufferers treated through the years. The gentle clink of a chiropractic adjustment against a metal table was a familiar comfort to Evelyn. She'd come from a long line of chiropractors in this tight-knit community, and she loved her small world filled with rolling hills, friendly faces, and a shared understanding of the body’s intricate mechanisms.

But lately, a new kind of tension had settled over the clinic's usual serenity.  The influx of patients was relentless: farmers suffering from backaches caused by long days hauling heavy loads, high schoolers hunched over their phones with agonizing headaches, and elderly ladies who couldn't find the right posture for a peaceful sleep. 

Evelyn glanced at the clock; another late-night call had just ended, leaving her staring out the window at the moonlit sky. Tonight was no different - she could hear a quiet, steady wind rustling through the nearby pines, a sound that usually brought her peace, but tonight it felt tinged with unease. It seemed as though this town, normally so rooted in tradition and simplicity, was beginning to feel… restless.
