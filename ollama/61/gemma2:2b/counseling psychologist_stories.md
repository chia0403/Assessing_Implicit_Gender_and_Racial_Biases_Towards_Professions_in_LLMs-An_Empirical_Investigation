Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the frantic beat of Evelyn Thorne's heart as she watched the storm gather on the horizon.  Inside her cozy office in Carmel Heights, California, the scent of lavender and old books filled the air like a warm hug. Her clients had started flooding in after the last winter storms left the region drenched, their lives thrown into disarray by the relentless rain and devastating loss they'd endured.  Evelyn was a skilled counselor, a veteran who had navigated countless turbulent tides for her patients. Yet tonight, she felt a tremor of fear run through her like an unwelcome current.

**Evelyn Thorne**, her name whispered in quiet reverence by those entrusted to her care, was no stranger to the depths of human suffering. But tonight, something hung heavy on her mind. As she glanced at her reflection in the polished mahogany desk, she couldn't shake off a feeling that this storm – both within and without – would ultimately wash over them all. 


What will happen to Evelyn as she navigates these troubled waters?
