The year was 1937, a time when Paris shimmered under a perpetual twilight. Rain dripped from the wrought-iron balconies of the artist’s studio as if mirroring the melancholy that seemed to permeate every corner of the city. Inside, Camille Dubois, her face pale and drawn like an old photograph in the dim light, surveyed the canvases piled high against the wall. Each one, a testament to her despair.  The vibrant blues of the Parisian sky had dulled into shades of gray; the once-thriving colours of her imagination seemed washed out, leaving behind only an echoing emptiness. Her masterpiece, a sprawling canvas depicting the Seine ablaze with sunset, sat untouched, a monument to her artistic stagnation. 

Camille was a painter born and raised in this very city, her soul steeped in its history and beauty. However, the once-familiar streets now seemed shrouded in a veil of uncertainty. The allure of creation had waned, leaving behind only an anxious gnawing at her gut, a constant reminder that she couldn’t quite grasp hold of what she was meant to create, or if she was even destined to.
