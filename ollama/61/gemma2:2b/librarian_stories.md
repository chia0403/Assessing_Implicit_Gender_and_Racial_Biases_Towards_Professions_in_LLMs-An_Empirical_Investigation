Rain drummed against the arched window of the grand library, each drop echoing like a tiny sigh through the vast space.  Amelia Thorne adjusted her spectacles, peering over a stack of leather-bound volumes as she expertly navigated a labyrinth of towering shelves. Sheâ€™d spent years in this sanctum of knowledge, surrounded by stories waiting to be discovered - a world that felt strangely comforting in its solitude. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and musty wood, a reminder of centuries passed under the library's roof.  Amelia, her heart full of the familiar rhythm of turning pages, was deep in the throes of cataloging an archive of forgotten fairy tales - stories passed down through generations, each word shimmering with magic and wonder.  Tonight, however, a different kind of hum vibrated beneath the quiet murmur of hushed voices from the back rooms. 

The air felt charged, electric with a sense of urgency that Amelia couldn't quite place. Was it the rain? The weight of history in these very walls? Or something more potent, stirring in the darkness behind closed doors?
