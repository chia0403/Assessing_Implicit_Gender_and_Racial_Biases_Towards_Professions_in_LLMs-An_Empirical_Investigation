## Opening:

The air hung thick with the scent of mothballs and stale cigarette smoke in room 318.  Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Majestic Hotel, each drop drumming a silent rhythm against the metal shutters that framed the view outside. Inside, Bartholomew "Barty" Bellweather, his name practically worn away by years of service, carefully tucked the miniature floral bouquet under the doorstop of room 318. He'd been on duty here for five years now, and somehow, the humdrum life of a bellhop continued to be both familiar and thrillingly mysterious.

## Setting:

The Majestic Hotel, built in the roaring twenties with its Art Deco facade, stood as a monument to a bygone era. Now, its glamour had faded into a melancholic charm reminiscent of old Hollywood's golden age. Despite the grandeur of the hotel's once opulent lobby and grand ballroom, where champagne flowed freely and music filled the air, most of the other rooms were dusty relics inhabited by weary travelers with stories untold.  Barty himself felt like a character out of a play; his worn uniform stood in stark contrast to the gleaming silver that lined the hotel's corridors. He was, however, one of the few who still cherished a life lived amidst the whispers and secrets of the forgotten.

## Main Character:

Bartholomew Bellweather (known as Barty) - A man of quiet dignity with eyes like faded whiskey and a smile that had seen more than its share of sorrow and hope. He knew every creak in the hotel's aging bones, every secret tucked behind the worn velvet curtains of the grand ballroom.
