The aroma of burnt oil and gasoline hung thick in the air of "Rewind Automotive," a greasy testament to its lifeblood: a kaleidoscope of sputtering engines, worn brake pads, and the ever-present promise of mechanical resurrection. Inside, Elias Thorne, known affectionately as "Eli" by everyone who knew him, hunched over the engine of an ancient Mustang, his hands moving with the practiced grace of a surgeon wielding a scalpel. The year was 2047, and the city of Detroit, a steel skeleton against a backdrop of neon-infused skies, hummed with the quiet symphony of urban life.

Eli was in his element; surrounded by tools of his trade, he could lose himself in the intricate dance of metal, gears, and pistons.  His workshop, crammed into a former factory warehouse, felt like an oasis - a haven from the relentless pace of 21st-century living, where time seemed to slow down with every rattle and click. But tonight, something was different. A sense of unease hung in the air, a stark contrast to the familiar comfort he usually found within these walls.  A storm, brewing like an industrial nightmare, was poised on the horizon, and its thunderous roar echoed Eli's mounting anxiety.  The Mustang wouldn’t start; this wasn’t just another routine check-up. Something deeper felt amiss.
