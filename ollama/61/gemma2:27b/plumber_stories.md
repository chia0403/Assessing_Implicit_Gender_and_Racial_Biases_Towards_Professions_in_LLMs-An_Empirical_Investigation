The relentless drip, drip, drip of a leaky faucet echoed through Silas Tiberius Bartholomew's skull like a war drum. He tightened his brow, shoving his greasy wrench further into the bowels of the antique sink.  

Silas was no stranger to temperamental plumbing. For twenty years, he'd wrestled with balky pipes and defiant toilets in the labyrinthine Victorian homes of Oakhaven. His business card read simply "Silas Bartholomew - Plumbing Solutions," but in a town steeped in history like this, Silas felt less like a plumber and more like an archaeologist, excavating the secrets hidden within the aging bones of these houses.

Today's excavation site was a grand old dame on Maple Street, its peeling paint and overgrown ivy whispering tales of forgotten grandeur. The faucet, a brass behemoth with ornate carvings, seemed determined to defy Silas' every attempt at repair. It pulsed with an insistent rhythm, each drop adding another layer to the growing puddle on the floor, reflecting the dim light filtering through the stained-glass window.

The air was thick with the scent of mildew and lavender polish, a peculiar combination that only seemed to amplify the sense of unease creeping over Silas. He felt watched, not by the house itself, but by something unseen, lurking in the shadows of this forgotten bathroom.
