Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia Cartwright's office, blurring the already dismal view of the alley behind her building. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a fitting aroma for the cramped space she called home away from home. Stacks of dusty files threatened to topple over, vying for attention alongside overflowing ashtrays and precariously balanced stacks of law textbooks. Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun and dark circles etching themselves under her green eyes, chewed on the end of her pen, her gaze fixed on the crumpled eviction notice lying on her desk.

It wasn't her own eviction notice, thankfully. This one belonged to Mrs. Odette Dubois, a frail woman Amelia had been representing pro bono for weeks now. Mrs. Dubois was facing eviction from her family home - a charming Victorian nestled amidst the gentrifying sprawl of Brooklyn â€“  due to a shady developer claiming ownership based on forged documents.
