The bell above the door jingled merrily, announcing another soul seeking refuge from the midday sun. Alistair Finchley, proprietor of Finchley's Fine Cuts for over thirty years, glanced up from the newspaper he was perusing. His eyes, magnified by thick spectacles perched precariously on his nose, crinkled at the corners as a smile spread across his weathered face. 

His barbershop, nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, was a sanctuary of sorts â€“ a haven from the hustle and bustle of the outside world. The scent of bay rum and shaving cream hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee Alistair always kept on hand for his regulars.  Sunbeams streamed through the dusty windowpane, illuminating swirls of silver hair caught in the afternoon light. 

Alistair laid down his paper, folded it neatly, and rose from his worn barber chair, its leather creaking familiarly. He straightened his apron, dusted off his hands, and turned to greet his new customer with a warm "Welcome to Finchley's, sonny! What can I do for you today?"
