The air in the ambulance thrummed with a low, insistent hum – a symphony of sirens weaving through the urban cacophony. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the neon signs and streetlights into streaks of colour. Inside, Amelia Rose Callahan, her blonde ponytail escaping its confines under the pressure of her surgical cap, battled the sway of the vehicle as she checked the vitals of the man slumped on the stretcher. His face was pale, slick with sweat, his breathing shallow and ragged.

Amelia gripped the man's wrist, feeling for a pulse that throbbed weakly beneath her fingertips. This was it, the reason she hadn't slept in 36 hours, fuelled by adrenaline and lukewarm coffee: another life hanging in the balance.  The scene outside the ambulance window – a tangle of wet asphalt and shadowed buildings – faded away. All that mattered was the man before her, his chest rising and falling with agonizing slowness.

"We're almost there," Amelia murmured, her voice calm despite the anxiety gnawing at her insides. "Just hold on."
