Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy General Hospital, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Eleanor Ainsworth's heart. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the linoleum floor, already slick with spilled disinfectant and the ghosts of countless emergencies past. A pungent cocktail of antiseptic and fear hung heavy in the air. 

Eleanor tugged her stethoscope tighter around her neck, its cold metal a reassuring weight against her damp scrubs.  The tremor in her hand betrayed her unease. Tonight, the usually bustling ER felt eerily quiet, punctuated only by the occasional wail of sirens slicing through the storm. A new shift had just begun, and Eleanor, seasoned though she was, found herself bracing for whatever chaos the night might bring.
