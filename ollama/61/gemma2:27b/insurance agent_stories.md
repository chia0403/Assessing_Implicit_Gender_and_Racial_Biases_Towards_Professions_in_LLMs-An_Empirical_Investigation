Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Theodore "Ted" Finnegan's office, mimicking the incessant drumming in his chest.  His tiny cubicle, crammed between the overflowing filing cabinets and the perpetually-jammed coffee machine, felt more like a coffin than a workspace today. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a potent cocktail Ted had grown all too familiar with in his five years as an insurance agent for "Reliable Assurance" - anything but reliable, if you asked him. 

Outside, the neon signs of downtown Elmwood flickered through the rain-streaked glass.  Ted glanced at the clock - 5:47 pm. Just three more minutes until he could escape this dreary purgatory and drown his sorrows in a lukewarm beer at "The Rusty Tap".

Suddenly, a sharp rapping on his cubicle door jolted him back to reality.  His heart skipped a beat. Visitors were rare, especially after hours. He straightened his rumpled tie and muttered, "Come in."
