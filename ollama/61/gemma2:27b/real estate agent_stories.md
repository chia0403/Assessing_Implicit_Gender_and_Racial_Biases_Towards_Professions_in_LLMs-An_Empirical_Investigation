The humidity clung to Eleanor Winthrop like a second skin as she trudged up the overgrown path, each step crunching on fallen leaves and twigs. The Victorian mansion loomed before her, a behemoth of peeling paint and broken windows, its grandeur fading under a cloak of neglect.  Eleanor adjusted the strap of her satchel, sighing. This was not the kind of property she usually handled.

Nestled in the sleepy coastal town of Havenwood, Maine, Eleanor specialized in charming cottages and modern beach houses. But this sprawling estate, known locally as Blackwood Manor, had been sitting vacant for decades, a whispered legend amongst the townsfolk. Its history was murky, rife with rumours of hidden treasure, untimely deaths, and restless spirits. Yet, something about its melancholy beauty and forlorn silence tugged at Eleanor's curiosity.

She reached the rusted iron gates, their ornate design barely visible beneath years of rust. Pushing them open with a groan, she stepped onto the overgrown driveway, feeling a shiver crawl up her spine. This was more than just another listing; it felt like stepping into a forgotten world.
