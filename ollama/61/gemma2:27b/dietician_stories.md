Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia Blackwood's tiny office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Stacks of nutrition journals threatened to topple, interspersed with half-eaten protein bars and empty coffee mugs. Amelia rubbed a weary hand over her face, the fluorescent lights reflecting harshly in her hazel eyes.

She wasn't cut out for this corporate gig. Stuck in the dreary basement of "BodySculpt," a chain gym peddling unrealistic body image ideals, Amelia felt like a cog in a machine designed to churn profit, not promote genuine health. Her passion – helping people understand and nourish their bodies with real food – seemed miles away from the meal replacement shakes and protein-packed supplements that lined the shelves upstairs.
