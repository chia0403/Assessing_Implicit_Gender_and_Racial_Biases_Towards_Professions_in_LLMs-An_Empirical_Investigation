Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, blurring the already indistinct view of the concrete cityscape below. The rhythmic drumming echoed the tension throbbing in her temples. Another late night, another case file sprawled across her desk like a macabre puzzle. This one was particularly unsettling: a series of seemingly random assaults, each victim left with a cryptic symbol carved into their flesh â€“ a stylized serpent swallowing its own tail.

Evelyn, a woman whose sharp intellect was matched only by the intensity in her sapphire eyes, tapped her pen against the file, her brow furrowed. These weren't the typical crimes she dealt with; they lacked the clear motive and methodical planning that usually defined violent offenders. This felt different, almost ritualistic. A shiver ran down her spine. What kind of mind could conceive such a thing?
