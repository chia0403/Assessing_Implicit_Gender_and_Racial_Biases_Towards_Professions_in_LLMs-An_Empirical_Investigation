The humid Miami air hung thick, heavy with the scent of saltwater and sunscreen.  Isabelle "Izzy" Diaz adjusted her scarlet sundress, tugging at the hem to keep it from clinging uncomfortably in the oppressive heat. She wiped the sheen of sweat off her forehead with a tissue, glancing nervously at the imposing glass and steel structure before her. The Atlantis Tower, home to countless luxury condominiums and, more importantly, Mr. Antonio Diaz, CEO of AquaVita Properties. Izzy was on her game today â€“ she'd practiced her pitch until it flowed effortlessly, memorized every detail of the new beachfront development, and even donned a pair of killer heels that made her feel invincible (albeit slightly unsteady). Today was about proving herself. After months of struggling to break into the high-end real estate market, this meeting with Mr. Diaz could be Izzy's ticket to finally hitting it big.
