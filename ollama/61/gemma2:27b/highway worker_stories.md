The Arizona sun beat down on Jasper "Jazz" Callahan's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. He wiped the sweat from his brow with a grimy rag, leaving a streak of orange dirt across his forehead. The endless ribbon of asphalt stretched out before him, shimmering in the heat haze. A chorus of cicadas buzzed incessantly from the scrubby desert brush lining the highway.

Jazz squinted at the horizon, where the serrated peaks of the Superstition Mountains stood like sentinels against the impossibly blue sky. He loved the raw beauty of this place, the vast emptiness that felt strangely comforting. But today, even the majestic mountains couldn't soothe the unease gnawing at him. It had started a few days ago, a prickling sensation on the back of his neck, like someone was watching him.

He shook off the feeling, chalking it up to fatigue. He'd been working double shifts lately, patching potholes and fixing guardrails along this desolate stretch of highway 60. Still, as he bent down to tighten a bolt on the guardrail post, a sudden gust of wind sent a shiver down his spine. It carried with it the faintest scent, something acrid and unfamiliar, that lingered in the air long after the wind had died down.

Jazz straightened up, eyes scanning the deserted highway. Everything seemed normal: a lone pickup truck speeding in the distance, a tumbleweed rolling across the asphalt. But the feeling persisted, an unshakeable sense that he was not alone.
