Rain lashed against the greenhouse roof, mimicking the hammering in Silas Hawthorne's chest. The glass panes trembled, threatening to shatter under the relentless onslaught.  Silas, his weathered hands clutching a dented watering can, stared out at the storm swirling beyond the humid haven of orchids and ferns.

The ancient oak tree that stood sentinel by the greenhouse entrance swayed precariously, its gnarled branches clawing at the leaden sky. Silas knew he should be securing the loose netting that protected his prized dahlias from the elements, but fear kept him rooted to the spot. It wasn't just the storm; a prickling unease had settled over him since dawn, a sense of impending doom he couldn't shake.

The sprawling estate, Blackwood Manor, had been Silas's domain for thirty years. He knew every inch of its rolling hills, whispering woods and manicured gardens like the back of his hand. But today, even the familiar scent of damp earth and blooming roses couldn't soothe his nerves. Something was amiss.
