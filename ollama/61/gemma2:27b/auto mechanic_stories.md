The greasy afternoon sun slanted through the open bay doors of "Earl's Engine Emporium," painting stripes across the dusty concrete floor.  Cinders, the shop cat, lay sprawled on a workbench, his ginger fur blending into the rusting tools scattered around him.  

Elias Thorne tightened the last bolt on a '67 Mustang's carburetor with a grunt of satisfaction. Sweat beaded on his brow, clinging to the dark curls that escaped from under his grease-stained cap. Elias wasn't fancy; he preferred denim overalls and calloused hands to starched shirts and manicured nails.

Today was slow, just the usual oil changes and brake jobs. But Elias longed for a challenge, something complex that would test his skills and let him lose himself in the intricate dance of pistons, valves, and spark plugs.  Little did he know, fate was about to deliver precisely that, in the form of a dented cherry-red pickup truck pulling into his lot, its engine coughing like a chain smoker with a bad cold.
