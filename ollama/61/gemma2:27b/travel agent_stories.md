The air conditioner in Esme Delacroix's office wheezed like an old man struggling up a flight of stairs. It struggled valiantly against the relentless July heat that blanketed Savannah, Georgia, but ultimately failed to create anything resembling a cool breeze. Sweat beaded on Esme's brow as she stared at the flickering fluorescent light overhead, its buzz a constant reminder of her dwindling clientele.

Esme Delacroix, owner and operator of "Delacroix Destinations," wasn't built for failure. She'd inherited her grandmother's passion for travel – her childhood was filled with stories of faraway lands and exotic cultures – and had poured every ounce of herself into building her travel agency from the ground up. But in an age dominated by online booking sites, charm and personalized itineraries seemed to be losing their appeal.  

The bell above her door chimed, startling Esme out of her reverie. A gust of warm air swept in with a figure obscured by the sunlight streaming through the doorway. Maybe this was it, she thought, a glimmer of hope on a sweltering afternoon. Perhaps a chance encounter that could rewrite her destiny.
