The scent of crayons and Elmer's glue hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of apple juice that clung stubbornly to the worn carpet.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Ms. Eleanor Winthrop's kindergarten classroom, illuminating a battlefield of scattered blocks and half-finished finger paintings.  Eleanor, her chestnut hair escaping its usual bun, surveyed the scene with a weary smile. Kindergarten was chaos beautifully disguised, she often thought.

Eleanor, though exhausted from a week battling fevers and forgotten naptime routines, couldn't help but be charmed by their boundless energy.
