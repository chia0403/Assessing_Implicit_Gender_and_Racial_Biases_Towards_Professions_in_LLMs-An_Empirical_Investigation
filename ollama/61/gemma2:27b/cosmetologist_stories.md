The scent of jasmine and lavender hung thick in the air, a calming contrast to the frenetic energy buzzing within Amelia Rose Cartwright. Her salon, "Rose & Bloom," nestled on a charming cobblestone street in Charleston's historic district, was abuzz with pre-wedding jitters. It wasn't her own wedding, mind you. Amelia was renowned for her ability to transform brides into ethereal visions, and today was no exception.

Sunlight streamed through the arched windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing above a symphony of curling irons, blow dryers, and chattering voices. Amelia, with her fiery red hair piled atop her head in a messy bun, darted between stations, wielding brushes and bobby pins with the precision of a surgeon. Her emerald green eyes sparkled with both excitement and a touch of apprehension. This wasn't just any wedding; it was for Charlotte Beaumont, the daughter of Charleston's most influential socialite, and Amelia knew every eye in the city would be on her bride-to-be.
