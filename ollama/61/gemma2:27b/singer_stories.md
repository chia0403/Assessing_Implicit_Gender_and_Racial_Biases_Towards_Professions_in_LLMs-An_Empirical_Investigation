The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and diesel fumes, a uniquely Bangkokian perfume. Neon signs flickered to life as dusk settled over the city, painting the Chao Phraya River in shimmering streaks of pink and orange. On a rickety stage perched precariously above a noodle stall, a young woman named Siriwan "Siri" Sukhumvit adjusted her microphone. Sweat beaded on her brow despite the cool evening air. 

She wasn't supposed to be here. Not singing for tips among the throngs of tourists and locals haggling over pad thai and mango sticky rice. She was supposed to be in a recording studio, laying down tracks for her debut album. But life, as Siri knew all too well, rarely went according to plan.
