The rooster's crow sliced through Elara Blackwood's sleep like a rusty scythe. She groaned, pulling the threadbare quilt tighter around her shoulders. Dawn was breaking over the rolling hills of Thistlewood Valley, painting the sky in hues of rose and apricot. It was going to be another scorching day, she could feel it in her bones. 

Elara shuffled out of bed, her bare feet sinking into the cool earth floor of her farmhouse. Dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight peeking through the cracks in the boarded window. Outside, the symphony of a new day had already begun: bleating sheep, clucking hens, and the distant lowing of cows. Thistlewood Valley was waking up. 

Her weathered hands, calloused from years of tilling the land, reached for her simple cotton dress hanging on a nail by the door. Today was market day in Oakhaven, the nearest town, and Elara needed to sell her plump tomatoes and crisp lettuce before they wilted under the relentless summer sun.  But as she stepped outside, a strange unease settled over her. The air felt thicker than usual, charged with an unnatural stillness. And for the first time, Elara noticed something odd: a faint shimmer in the air above the wheat field, like heat haze but tinged with an ethereal blue.
