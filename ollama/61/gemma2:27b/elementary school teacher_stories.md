The bell's shrill cry echoed through the cavernous hallway of Elmwood Elementary, instantly silencing the symphony of pre-lunch chatter. Ms. Amelia Rosethorn sighed contentedly, pushing a stray curl back into her braid as twenty wide-eyed third graders scrambled towards their designated lunch lines.  

Amelia loved this moment â€“ the controlled chaos before the calm descended once more. It was like watching ducklings being herded towards a pond: all frantic flapping and excited quacks, but ultimately ending up where they needed to be. She surveyed her classroom, a cheerful explosion of alphabet charts, hand-painted murals, and student artwork plastered across every inch of wall space.  

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Amelia's spine as she glanced out the window towards the woods bordering the schoolyard. The leaves, usually ablaze with autumn hues, seemed unusually still, the branches heavy and drooping like mournful arms.
