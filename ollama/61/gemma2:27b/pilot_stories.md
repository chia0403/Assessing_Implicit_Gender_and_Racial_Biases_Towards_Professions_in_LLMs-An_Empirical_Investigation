The pre-dawn sky over Reykjavik was awash in bruised lavender and smoky grey, the faintest hint of emerald shimmering on the horizon.  Captain Elara Gunnarsd√≥ttir shivered despite the thick wool sweater she wore beneath her flight suit, pulling the collar tighter against the biting Icelandic wind. Her breath puffed out in white clouds as she surveyed the runway, its slick surface reflecting the weak light like a mirror.

Today's flight promised to be anything but routine.  Elara was piloting a small cargo plane laden with vital medical supplies destined for a remote research station on Greenland's ice sheet. A storm system was brewing over the North Atlantic, and navigating through it would test even her years of experience.
