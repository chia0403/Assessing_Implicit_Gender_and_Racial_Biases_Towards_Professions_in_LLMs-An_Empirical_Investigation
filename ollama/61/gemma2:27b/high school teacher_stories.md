Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's English classroom, blurring the autumnal colors outside into an impressionistic swirl. The rhythmic drumming was the only sound louder than the anxious rustling of papers and coughs coming from her students hunched over their desks. It was essay day - a daunting task for even the most seasoned writer, let alone teenagers grappling with Shakespearean sonnets and iambic pentameter.

Amy, however, found a strange calm in the storm. She loved this part â€“ the quiet hum of concentration, the occasional gasp of understanding, the way her students seemed to shrink into themselves as they wrestled with complex ideas. Today's topic was "The Nature of Ambition," inspired by Macbeth's relentless pursuit of power. Amy knew it was a heavy theme for 16-year-olds, but she also believed it held timeless relevance. After all, weren't they all on their own journeys of ambition, striving towards futures both bright and uncertain?
