Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thorne's cramped apartment, mirroring the storm brewing inside him.  The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" noodle bar across the street cast an unsettling green glow onto his cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of dog-eared notebooks and half-eaten instant ramen packets. Elias, a journalist with a nose for trouble and a penchant for whiskey, stared at the screen, the cursor blinking mockingly at him.  His latest expos√© - a scathing piece on the city's corrupt sanitation department - was due tomorrow, but his leads had dried up faster than the last drops of bourbon in his bottle.

The air hung thick with frustration and stale cigarette smoke. Elias ran a hand through his disheveled hair, the weight of his deadline pressing down on him like a leaden cloak. He needed something, anything, to break this case wide open.  He glanced at the worn photograph perched precariously on his desk lamp - a younger version of himself grinning alongside his late father, a renowned investigative journalist who instilled in Elias a fierce sense of justice. 

"What would Dad do?" he muttered, taking a swig from his lukewarm coffee. The answer seemed to echo through the room: "Follow the money."
