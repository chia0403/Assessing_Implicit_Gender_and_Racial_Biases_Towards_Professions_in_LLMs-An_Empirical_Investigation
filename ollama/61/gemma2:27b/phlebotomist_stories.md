The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Elara Blackwood's head as she surveyed her workstation: a pristine countertop gleaming with stainless steel, stocked with rows of neatly labelled vials, butterfly needles glinting under the harsh light. The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in the sterile world of St. Jude's Hospital. Elara, with her calm blue eyes and gentle smile, was a master of drawing blood, a skill she wielded with practiced precision.

But today felt different. A strange unease prickled at her skin, a sensation heightened by the unusually quiet morning shift. The usual symphony of beeping monitors and hurried footsteps seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling stillness that pressed against her ears. It was as if the hospital itself held its breath, waiting for something unknown.

A shadow fell across her workbench. Elara looked up to see Dr. Alistair Thorne, his face pale and drawn, his usually crisp white coat crumpled. He avoided her gaze as he placed a requisition form on the counter, the paper trembling slightly in his hand. 

"Elara," he began, his voice strained, "We have a new patient... an unusual one."
