The humid Florida air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont like a damp blanket as she navigated the winding paths of Serenity Springs Wildlife Sanctuary. Cypress trees groaned under the weight of Spanish moss, their ancient limbs casting long, skeletal shadows across the sun-dappled ground. A chorus of cicadas buzzed incessantly, their rhythmic chirping punctuated by the occasional screech of a hawk circling overhead. Ellie paused, listening intently as a soft whimper echoed from a nearby enclosure.

It was Maya, a three-legged bobcat rescued from a roadside petting zoo. Maya, with her emerald eyes and sleek, sand-colored fur, always seemed to sense when Ellie was near, greeting her with a rumbling purr despite her wary nature. Today, however, there was an edge of distress in her cry. Ellie's heart clenched. Something wasn't right.
