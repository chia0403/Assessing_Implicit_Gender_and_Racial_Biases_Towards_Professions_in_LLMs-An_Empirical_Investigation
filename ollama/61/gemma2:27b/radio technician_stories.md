Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the shed, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the cramped space. The air hung heavy with the scent of oil and ozone, mingling with the faint metallic tang of solder. Elias "Eli" Vandermeer squinted at the circuit board laid out on his workbench, its intricate pathways illuminated by the flickering fluorescent bulb overhead.

Eli was a man built for tinkering, his hands calloused and strong, each fingertip bearing the mark of countless repairs. His salt-and-pepper hair stuck out at odd angles beneath his grease-stained cap, and his brow furrowed in concentration as he traced a loose connection with a multimeter. Outside, the storm raged on, but within the sanctuary of his shed, Eli found solace in the hum of transistors and the satisfying click of a properly aligned circuit. 

He was deep in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, miles from the nearest town, where radio waves were as precious as gold dust. His customers relied on him to keep their radios singing, connecting them to the outside world, offering news, music, and a lifeline to loved ones far away.
