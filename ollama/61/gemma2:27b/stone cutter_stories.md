The midday sun beat down on Aeliana Thorne's shoulders, warming her through the thin linen tunic she wore. Dust motes danced in the harsh light filtering through the open doorway of her workshop, illuminating the rough-hewn walls and scattered chunks of granite littering the floor. The air hung heavy with the scent of stone dust and sweat, a familiar perfume Aeliana had come to associate with both comfort and toil. Today, she was wrestling with a particularly stubborn block of Carrara marble, its pristine white surface marred by the deep grooves her chisel had carved. 


Aeliana ran a calloused hand over the emerging form, tracing the delicate curve of a cherub's cheek. This commission, a baptismal font for the local cathedral, was proving more demanding than she anticipated. The fine detail required a level of precision and patience she hadn't needed for her previous work - sturdy tombstones and humble fireplaces. But Aeliana was determined to rise to the challenge. Her reputation as the finest stone cutter in the region rested on this delicate masterpiece.
