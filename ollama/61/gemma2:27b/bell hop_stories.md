The polished brass of the revolving door whirred like a disgruntled dragon as Theodore Bartholomew "Teddy" Finch wrestled with a steamer trunk the size of a small pony.  Sweat prickled on his forehead despite the cool air conditioning pumping through The Grand Blackwood Hotel's lobby. Teddy cursed under his breath, wishing for the hundredth time that he hadn't taken this bellhop gig. He wasn't built for hauling luggage; he was built for composing sonnets and dreaming of faraway lands.

But rent needed paying, and poetry didn't exactly fill a hungry stomach.  He maneuvered the trunk through the double doors leading into the cavernous lobby, its marble floor gleaming like a freshly-laid egg under the glittering chandeliers. A sea of well-heeled travelers buzzed around him, their voices a symphony of clipped accents and exotic languages. Teddy longed to be among them, not trudging behind with their burdensome belongings. He squinted at the destination scrawled on a tag attached to the trunk: Suite 1207.  Twelve floors up.

This was going to be a long night.
