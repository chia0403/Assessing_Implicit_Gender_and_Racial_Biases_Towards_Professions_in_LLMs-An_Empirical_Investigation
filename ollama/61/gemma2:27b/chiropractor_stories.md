The flickering neon sign outside Dr. Elias Finchâ€™s office buzzed with an unsettling fervor, casting a sickly green glow onto the rain-slicked asphalt. The air hung heavy with the scent of ozone and wet concrete, a distinctly urban aroma that Elias had come to associate with late nights and weary patients.

Inside, the waiting room was empty except for a lone potted fern struggling valiantly against the dim fluorescent light. Elias sighed, running a hand through his already tousled brown hair. It was past eight on a Friday night, and he'd been expecting a rush after the storm rolled in.

He hadn't anticipated an empty schedule, especially not in this part of town, where back pain and stiff necks were as commonplace as pigeons and discarded takeout containers.  Elias leaned against his desk, staring out at the shimmering cityscape blurred by the rain. A nagging feeling gnawed at him - a sense that something was amiss. The quiet was unsettling, almost unnatural for a Friday night in the heart of New Haven.
