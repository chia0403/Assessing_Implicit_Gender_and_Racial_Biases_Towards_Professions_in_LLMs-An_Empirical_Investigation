The flickering neon sign outside buzzed incessantly, casting an anemic pink glow over the greasy asphalt parking lot. Rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof, each drop a tiny hammer blow on Elara June Blackwood's already frayed nerves. Inside "Big Ed's Burgers and Shakes," the air hung thick with the aroma of frying onions, stale coffee, and desperation.  

Elara, a wisp of a girl with tired eyes framed by greasy bangs, balanced three overflowing trays precariously in her hands, navigating the crowded diner aisles. Her worn-out sneakers squeaked against the linoleum floor, a counterpoint to the relentless clatter of dishes and the drone of disgruntled customers complaining about lukewarm fries.  Tonight felt different though â€“ heavier somehow. Like a storm brewing not just outside, but within the very walls of Big Ed's.
