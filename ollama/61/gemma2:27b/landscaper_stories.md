The humid air hung heavy over Amelia "Amy" Rosepetal as she knelt amongst the vibrant lavender bushes, their heady perfume battling with the scent of freshly cut grass.  Sunlight dappled through the ancient oak's branches, casting dancing shadows on the meticulously manicured lawn of Blackwood Manor. It was a scene straight out of a fairytale, but Amy wasnâ€™t charmed.

Now, the sprawling estate was renowned for its exquisite gardens and Amy felt the weight of that legacy on her shoulders. But today, something was different. A shiver ran down her spine, a prickle of unease she couldn't shake off.  It wasn't the usual anxieties about pleasing Mrs. Blackwood, whose sharp eyes missed nothing. No, this was something deeper, something whispering in the rustle of leaves and the chirping of unseen birds.
