Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and fear, a pungent cocktail that always made Dr. Eleanor Vance's stomach clench. It was a stormy Tuesday night in Havenwood, a sleepy coastal town where secrets whispered on the salt-laced wind and shadows stretched long across the cobbled streets. Eleanor glanced at the clock - 10:32 pm.  She should be home by now, curled up with a book and a steaming mug of chamomile tea, but duty called.

A whimper pierced through the storm's roar. A small ginger kitten huddled in the corner, its eyes wide with terror. Eleanor knelt beside it, her touch gentle as she stroked its matted fur. The kitten meowed again, this time a desperate plea for comfort. Outside, the wind howled, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside Eleanor herself.  She knew this night wouldn't be ending anytime soon.
