The gavel lay heavy in Judge Alistair Finch’s hand, its polished mahogany reflecting the flickering gaslight above his bench. Dust motes danced in the golden halo, adding to the courtroom's already somber atmosphere. Rain lashed against the high windows of the Victorian courthouse, mirroring the storm brewing inside Alistair. He was a man accustomed to order, to the clear lines drawn between right and wrong, justice served with the measured clang of his gavel. 

But today's case, involving the theft of a seemingly worthless trinket from a renowned antiquities collector, had chipped away at those certainties. The evidence was circumstantial, pointing fingers but refusing to fully grasp. And then there was the defendant – a young woman with haunted eyes and a tremor in her hands that spoke of more than just guilt.  Alistair stared down at the worn surface of his bench, his heart heavy with doubt. Was justice truly blind, or did it sometimes choose to see only what it wanted?

The city of Ashbourne, steeped in history and shrouded in mist, seemed to reflect Alistair's inner turmoil. Its cobbled streets whispered tales of long-gone eras, its gothic architecture casting shadows that stretched like grasping fingers. Tonight, even the flickering gaslights seemed unable to pierce the gloom that settled over the judge's heart.
