The fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda Ramirez's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of Discount Depot.  It was 3:17 pm, prime time for grumpy retirees clutching coupons and harried mothers wrangling sugar-crazed toddlers. Esmeralda sighed, her nametag reflecting the harsh light like a beacon of boredom. She expertly scanned a can of beans, her movements practiced and efficient. Another Tuesday afternoon melting into oblivion behind the chipped laminate counter. 

But today was different. Today, a man walked in who looked like he'd stepped out of a faded photograph â€“ fedora perched at a jaunty angle, trench coat swishing dramatically with every step. Esmeralda watched him approach, his face obscured by the shadow of the brim. A shiver ran down her spine. Something about him felt...off.
