The Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Ramirez's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat trickled down his temples, stinging his eyes as he balanced precariously on the sloped asphalt shingles. The air hung heavy and still, thick with the smell of tar and dust. Below him, Phoenix sprawled out in a shimmer of heat haze, the distant hum of traffic barely penetrating the quiet concentration required to lay each shingle perfectly.

Eli wasn't bothered by the heat. He was used to it. Years spent under the relentless desert sun had toughened his skin and forged a resilience within him. This particular roof, however, presented a unique challenge. It belonged to an old Victorian mansion perched precariously on a hillside, its gingerbread trim rotting and its stained glass windows clouded with age. The roof itself was a patchwork of mismatched shingles, some cracked, others warped, all testament to decades of neglect.

Eli gripped his hammer tighter, the worn leather handle familiar in his calloused hand.  He knew this job wouldn't be easy, but he took pride in tackling the toughest roofs in Phoenix. There was something satisfying about restoring order to chaos, bringing beauty back to something forgotten. As Eli hoisted himself up another shingle, he couldn't help but wonder what secrets this old house held beneath its decaying facade.
