The air in "Nails by Natalia" hung thick with the scent of acetone and cinnamon polish. Natalia Petrova hummed along to the 80s pop blasting from her ancient boombox, carefully maneuvering a tiny rhinestone onto the nail of Mrs. Goldberg's pinky finger. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down mercilessly on the dusty strip mall parking lot.  

Mrs. Goldberg winced as Natalia's tweezers caught a sliver of skin. "Oh, dearie," she clucked, dabbing at the small prick with a tissue. "My old cuticles are more trouble than they're worth these days." 


Natalia flashed her warmest smile, the one that never failed to charm even the grumpiest client. "Don't you worry, Mrs. Goldberg. A little sparkle hides all sins," she said, winking and reaching for the holographic top coat. But Natalia wasn't thinking about glitter or cuticles. Her mind was racing, replaying a cryptic phone call from her sister in Russia â€“ a call that hinted at trouble brewing back home. Trouble that might require Natalia to leave everything behind and return to a place she swore she'd never see again.
