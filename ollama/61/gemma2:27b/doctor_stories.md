The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and woodsmoke, a peculiar blend unique to this remote outpost nestled in the foothills of the Himalayas.  Eliza, her stethoscope dangling from her neck like a worn talisman, stared out at the swirling grey mass engulfing the mountain peaks.

She knew they were running low on supplies â€“ painkillers, antibiotics, even bandages. And then there was little Kiran, his tiny chest racked with coughs that sounded like rusty hinges. His fever had spiked again, and Eliza feared pneumonia was setting in.

She glanced at the old kerosene lamp flickering uncertainly in the corner, casting elongated shadows that danced across the faces of her waiting patients. Each face held a story, a silent plea for relief.  Eliza took a deep breath, steeling herself for another long night. She was all they had.
