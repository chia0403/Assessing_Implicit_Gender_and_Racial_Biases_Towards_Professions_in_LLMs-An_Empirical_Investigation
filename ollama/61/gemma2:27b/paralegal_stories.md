Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. Eleanor Vance hunched over her desk, the flickering fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across her tired face. Stacks of case files teetered precariously around her, threatening to avalanche onto the worn linoleum floor. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation - a familiar aroma in the cramped, cluttered office of "Justice For All" Legal Services.

Eleanor was no stranger to long nights and overflowing inboxes. As senior paralegal for the firm, she was the glue that held everything together: drafting motions, tracking down witnesses, poring over mountains of evidence. Tonight, however, a knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. The case files before her weren't just any ordinary legal battles; they held the potential to expose a web of corruption reaching into the highest echelons of power.
