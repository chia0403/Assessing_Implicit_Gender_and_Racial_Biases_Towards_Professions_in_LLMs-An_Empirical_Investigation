The scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, momentarily masking the faint but persistent smell of stale coffee that permeated Elara Sinclair's world. Outside, rain lashed against the plate glass windows of Sinclair's Pharmacy, blurring the vibrant colours of the autumnal leaves swirling on Elm Street. Elara sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she double-checked the prescription for Mrs. Henderson's blood pressure medication.

It was a Wednesday afternoon, and the usual post-lunch lull had yet to arrive. The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new customer. Elara looked up from the counter, bracing herself for another inquiry about flu shots or a panicked parent searching for children's cough syrup. Instead, her eyes met those of a man she'd never seen before, a tall figure shrouded in the shadows of a heavy trench coat. He scanned the pharmacy with an intensity that sent a shiver down Elara's spine.  His gaze lingered on the row of locked cabinets behind her, and something about his presence felt unsettlingly out of place. 

Who was this man, and what did he want?  Elara’s pharmacist instincts told her to trust her gut. Something wasn’t right.
