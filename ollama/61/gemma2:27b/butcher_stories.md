The air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary in Bartholomew "Barty" Thorne's shop. Dawn light, barely peeking through the grime-coated windows, illuminated the sawdust-strewn floor where crimson puddles glistened like spilled rubies. Barty, his burly frame hunched over a slab of beef, wielded his cleaver with practiced precision, the rhythmic thudding echoing in the stillness. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Grimsborough Market were just beginning to stir, but within Barty's cramped domain, time seemed suspended, measured only by the steady pulse of his trade. 


This morning, however, a disquiet gnawed at Barty. The usual jovial bustle of market day felt distant, muffled by a growing unease that settled heavy in his gut. He glanced nervously at the clock above the door – half past five – and wondered why Old Man Withers hadn't yet arrived for his daily delivery of sausages. Withers was as punctual as the sunrise, his arrival heralding the start of Barty's workday. But today, there was only silence, a silence that felt unnaturally profound in the pre-dawn gloom.
