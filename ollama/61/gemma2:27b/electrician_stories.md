The air hung thick with humidity, heavy enough to make each breath feel like swallowing cotton wool.  Sweat beaded on Elias Thorne’s brow, tracing paths through the grime that clung stubbornly to his skin despite the bandana he wore. He squinted at the tangle of wires before him, their frayed ends whispering tales of neglect and forgotten maintenance. This old farmhouse, perched precariously on a hillside overlooking the sleepy town of Havenwood, was a symphony of creaks and groans, its bones weary with age.

Elias sighed, his calloused fingers tracing the brittle insulation. Fixing this ancient wiring system was like trying to untangle a kraken – frustrating, unpredictable, and potentially lethal. He’d been called in by Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne, a frail woman with eyes that held the wisdom of centuries. She'd insisted on fixing the flickering lights herself before finally admitting defeat and calling Elias, Havenwood’s only electrician for miles.

The setting sun cast long shadows through the dusty windows, painting the room in an eerie orange glow. Outside, cicadas buzzed their monotonous song, a chorus that underscored the silence within the house.  Elias tightened his grip on his toolbox, steeling himself for the battle ahead. This wouldn't be easy, but he was Elias Thorne, and he didn't back down from a challenge. Not when Mrs. Hawthorne’s flickering hope depended on it.
