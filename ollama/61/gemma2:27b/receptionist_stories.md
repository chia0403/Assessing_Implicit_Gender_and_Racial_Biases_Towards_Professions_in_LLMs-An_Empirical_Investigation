The flickering fluorescent light above Elsie Beatrice Cartwrightâ€™s head buzzed incessantly, mimicking the restless hum in her own chest. It was 3:47 pm on a Wednesday, and the waiting room of Dr. Alistair Finch's practice was eerily empty. Normally this time was a flurry of anxious coughs, rustling magazines, and hushed phone calls. Today, though, only Elsie and the dust motes dancing in the afternoon sun occupied the space. 

Elsie tapped her scarlet-painted nails on the polished oak desk, her gaze flitting between the antique clock ticking away on the wall and the door leading to Dr. Finch's office. His appointment schedule was usually packed, yet he'd been conspicuously absent for over an hour. Elsie knew better than to pry, but a gnawing unease began to twist in her stomach.  Dr. Finch wasn't just her employer; he was also her confidante, the only person who truly understood the weight of secrets she carried within her heart.
