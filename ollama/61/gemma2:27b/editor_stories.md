Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Inkwell, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the bookstore sign across the street. Eleanor Vance, senior editor at Blackwood Publishing, sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl behind her ear. Her office, nestled in the attic nook of a converted Victorian townhouse, was as cramped and cluttered as her mind. Stacks of manuscripts threatened to topple, their spines bearing titles like "The Alchemist's Apprentice" and "Whispers from the Void."

Eleanor rubbed tired eyes, the harsh fluorescent light doing little to alleviate the throbbing headache building behind them. Another rejection email sat open on her screen, this one for a historical romance novel that, while well-written, lacked the spark Blackwood was looking for. The pressure was mounting. Their latest bestseller had tanked, and Eleanor's boss was breathing down her neck for a hit.  

Suddenly, a sharp rapping at the door startled her. She hadn’t expected anyone, least of all in this weather. “Just a minute!” she called out, hastily shoving aside a pile of rejection slips before opening the door.
