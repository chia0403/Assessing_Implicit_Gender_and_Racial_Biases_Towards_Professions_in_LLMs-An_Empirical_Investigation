Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. Tourist groups milled about, their cameras and selfie sticks at the ready, as they made their way through the crowded thoroughfare. Amidst the chaos, Aurora "Rory" Thompson stood out - or rather, not stand out at all. As a seasoned tour guide with over a decade of experience leading visitors through the winding streets and temples of Petra, Rory had grown accustomed to blending into the background.

With her dark hair pulled back in a ponytail and a pair of worn-out sneakers on her feet, Rory moved effortlessly through the crowd, greeting tourists and answering questions about the history and significance of the site. She knew every nook and cranny of the city, from the intricate carvings on the facades to the hidden passageways that only the most dedicated visitors ever discovered.

As she led a group of rowdy college students through the bustling streets, Rory's mind began to wander. It had been three years since her best friend, Lyra, had gone missing during an expedition to Egypt, and the wound still hadn't fully healed. Rory had always been driven by a sense of curiosity and adventure, but lately, she'd found herself feeling restless - as if there was something just out of reach, waiting for her to discover it.

Little did Rory know, this trip to Petra would be about to take an unexpected turn...
