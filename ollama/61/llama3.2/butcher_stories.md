Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the sea, shrouding the small fishing village of Ravenswood in a damp, gray mist that clung to everything it touched. It was a chill autumn evening, the kind that made you want to wrap your scarf tighter around your neck and hurry home to a warm hearth and a hot meal.

In a small shop on the edge of the village, nestled between a bakery and a bookshop, Emilia Rose Thistlewaite, the village's respected butcher, was preparing for another long night. The sign above her door creaked in the wind, reading "Emilia Rose Thistlewaite, Meat and Poultry Specialist" in elegant script.

Inside the shop, the smell of fresh meat and baking bread wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of Emilia's quiet humming as she worked. She was a skilled butcher, known for her attention to detail and her ability to coax even the most reluctant cuts into something tender and delicious. But tonight, something felt off. The villagers had been whispering among themselves all week, their usual cheerful chatter replaced by hushed tones and nervous glances.

As Emilia wrapped a package of fresh salmon in brown paper and twine, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to change in Ravenswood, something that would put her skills as a butcher to the ultimate test.
