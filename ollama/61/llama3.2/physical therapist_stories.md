Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished marble as Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office, adjusting her worn leather jacket against the chill of the Pacific Northwest evening. The sound of raindrops pattering against her umbrella and the hum of the city's nightlife created a soothing background noise that usually helped Lexi unwind after a long day at work.

As a physical therapist specializing in orthopedic rehabilitation, Lexi had spent years honing her skills to help patients recover from injuries and illnesses. Her own path to becoming a physical therapist was far from conventional – she'd grown up with a passion for sports and dance, only to be sidelined by a debilitating knee injury that left her struggling to walk without pain.

Despite the setbacks, Lexi had refused to let her injury define her. Instead, she poured all her energy into studying, working hard to earn her degree in physical therapy, and eventually landing a job at a prestigious hospital in Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood. Her colleagues admired her tenacity, her ability to connect with patients on a deep level, and her unorthodox approach to treatment – which often involved incorporating elements of yoga, Pilates, and dance into her rehabilitation protocols.

Tonight, Lexi was headed home from work, her mind still reeling from the emotional rollercoaster that had been her last session with one of her patients, a young woman named Sarah who was struggling to cope with the aftermath of a traumatic accident. As she walked down the sidewalk, lost in thought, Lexi felt an inexplicable sense of unease settling over her – as if something was off, like the quiet evening air was hiding secrets that only she could hear.

And then, just as she turned onto her street, Lexi noticed it: a piece of paper taped to the window of her apartment building, with a single sentence scrawled in red ink: "They're watching you, Lexi."
