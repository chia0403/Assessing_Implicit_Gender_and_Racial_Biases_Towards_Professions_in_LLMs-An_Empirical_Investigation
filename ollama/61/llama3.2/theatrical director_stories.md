Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The curtains drew shut on another disappointing night at the prestigious Bellvue Theatre, where Emily Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson had just finished delivering her final speech to the disheveled cast and crew. The evening's production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire had tanked, with only a handful of patrons staying to applaud, despite Lexi's best efforts.

As she packed up her worn leather satchel, which was adorned with the faded logo of her favorite playwright, Tennessee Williams, Lexi gazed out at the drizzly night sky over the sleepy town of Bellvue, Indiana. The theatre's grand entrance, a relic from an era when Broadway had been the epicenter of American theatre, loomed before her like a crumbling monolith.

Lexi took a deep breath, letting the chill of the autumn air fill her lungs as she stepped out into the darkness. The parking lot was almost deserted, save for a lone figure huddled in the corner of a nearby diner, sipping on a cup of coffee and watching Lexi with an intensity that made her skin prickle.

"Lexi," the stranger called out, their voice low and smooth as they rose from their seat, "can I have a word?"

Lexi's instincts told her to be wary, but something about this mysterious figure piqued her curiosity. She walked over, her eyes locked on theirs, as she wondered what secrets the night might hold for her, and whether the troubles of Bellvue Theatre could be salvaged... or if they were merely just beginning.
