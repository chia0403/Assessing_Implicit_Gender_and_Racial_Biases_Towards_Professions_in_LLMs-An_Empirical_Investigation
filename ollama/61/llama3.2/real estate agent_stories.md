Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the tranquil waters of Lake Tahoe, casting a warm orange glow over the resort town of Squaw Valley, California, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson adjusted her blazer and surveyed the sprawling lot before her. A sleek, modern mansion sat atop a hill overlooking the lake, its manicured lawn and perfectly trimmed hedges a testament to the owners' impeccable taste. Lexi, a seasoned real estate agent with a sharp mind for numbers and a keen eye for design, had been tasked with listing this property - and she was determined to make it shine.

Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the crisp mountain air fill her lungs as she gazed out at the breathtaking vista. She loved this time of day, when the crowds of tourists were thinning out and the locals were getting ready for their evening routines. It was the perfect time to get a head start on her day and tackle the toughest listings first.

With a satisfied smile, Lexi pulled out her phone and dialed the number of her trusty assistant, Rachel. "Hey girl, it's Lexi," she said, her voice husky from years of shouting over construction sites and negotiating deals with clients. "I'm at 3454 Tahoe Way, getting the cameras set up for the listing shoot tomorrow. You good to meet me there at 9?"

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Rachel's cheerful voice chimed in. "Yeah, I've got the photos and vids all ready to go. Can't wait to see this place come alive!"

Lexi grinned, feeling a thrill of excitement. This was going to be her best listing yet - and she was ready to make it happen.
