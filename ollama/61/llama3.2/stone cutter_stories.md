Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon streets of Wadi Musa. The air was thick with the scent of frankincense and myrrh, carried on the gentle breeze that whispered through the narrow alleys.

In a small workshop nestled between two crumbling stone facades, Aziz ibn Khalid al-Masri carefully selected a piece of Alabaster from his stash of prized stones. His hands, worn from years of cutting and shaping, moved with precision as he examined each fragment for its unique qualities. As the master stone cutter of Wadi Musa's most esteemed workshops, Aziz was renowned for his artistry and attention to detail.

With a satisfied nod, Aziz set the Alabaster aside and began to mix a concoction of oils and spices on a wooden workbench. His apprentice, a young boy named Ammar, watched with wide eyes as his master prepared for the night's work. Tonight was a special occasion â€“ a grand commission from the Sultan himself had come through, demanding that Aziz create a stunning portal gate for the palace entrance. The pressure was on, but Aziz was undaunted.

Just then, a knock at the door interrupted the evening's tranquility. It was Ammar, looking worried and out of breath. "Aziz, I've got news from the souk," he said, his voice barely above a whisper. "The Sultan's men are searching for someone... someone who looks exactly like you."
