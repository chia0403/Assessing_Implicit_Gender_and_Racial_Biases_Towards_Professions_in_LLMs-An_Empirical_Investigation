Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain poured down on the streets of Edinburgh like a relentless curtain, casting a misty veil over the city's ancient stones. Inside the grand townhouse on Thistle Street, where the wealthy and influential Lord Harrington resided, the atmosphere was equally somber. In the cramped, dimly lit servants' quarters, housekeeper Emily Augusta MacDonald huddled by the fire, her fingers moving deftly as she scrubbed away at a stubborn stain on the hearth.

It was a cold, drizzly November evening in 1885, and Emily's mind was preoccupied with more than just the mess on the hearth. The previous night, she had received an anonymous letter in the dead of night, its contents hinting at secrets within the Harrington household that would shake the very foundations of the stately home. As she scrubbed and rinsed, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that her life was about to take a dramatic turn.

How's this for a starting point?
