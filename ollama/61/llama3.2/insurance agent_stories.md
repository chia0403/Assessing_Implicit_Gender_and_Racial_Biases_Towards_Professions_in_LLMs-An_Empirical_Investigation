Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as Agent Vivian "Vee" LaFleur stepped out of her office building, a haze of cigarette smoke clinging to her tailored navy blue suit. Her eyes, a piercing shade of indigo, scanned the crowded street below, her gaze lingering on the clusters of people huddled under awnings, seeking refuge from the torrential downpour.

Vee took a long drag on her cigarette, blowing out a stream of smoke as she gazed up at the imposing oak tree looming over the sidewalk. Its gnarled branches seemed to stretch out like skeletal fingers, beckoning passersby to come closer. She smiled wryly to herself – a habit honed from years of dealing with the worst of humanity's misfortunes.

As an insurance agent specializing in high-risk policyholders, Vee had seen her fair share of catastrophe and heartbreak. But it was on days like this, when the rain seemed to wash away all sense of order, that she felt most at home. The city was a living, breathing entity, its rhythms and secrets waiting to be unraveled by someone with a keen eye – and a willingness to take risks.

Vee slipped her cigarette pack back into her pocket, smoothing out the wrinkles on her tailored trousers as she surveyed the wet streets of the French Quarter. Tonight would be a long night, filled with meetings, phone calls, and the faint scent of despair that clung to every policyholder like a bad omen. But Vee was ready – for whatever came her way, she'd have a plan, a smile, and an unyielding determination to keep it all from falling apart.
