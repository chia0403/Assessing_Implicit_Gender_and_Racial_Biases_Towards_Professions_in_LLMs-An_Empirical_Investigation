The neon lights of the city's bustling downtown district cast a gaudy glow over the crowded streets of New Haven.

Lexi couldn't help but feel drawn to the stranger's air of quiet confidence, despite the faint scent of danger that clung to him like a shadow. Little did she know, this chance encounter would set off a chain of events that would upend her life forever...
