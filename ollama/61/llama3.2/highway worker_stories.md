The sun had just started to set on the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets and homes. The only sound was the distant hum of traffic on Highway 12, which wound its way through the heart of the town like a steel serpent.

As a highway worker with the state department of transportation, he spent most of his days maintaining the roads that crisscrossed the country, making sure they were safe for drivers like his friend and coworker, Jake.
