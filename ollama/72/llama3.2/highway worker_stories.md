Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Oakdale, casting a golden glow over the rows of worn asphalt that stretched out like a serpentine ribbon along Highway 12. Among the din of revving engines and crunching gravel, Amos Everett "Am" Thompson trudged towards his truck, his bright orange vest a beacon of warning to any passing motorists.

As a highway worker with the state department of transportation, Am had spent countless nights like this, tending to potholes, clearing debris from the shoulder, and ensuring that the main thoroughfare remained safe for the early morning commuters. It was a job that required patience, attention to detail, and a willingness to get his hands dirty – all traits that Am possessed in spades.

Am loaded up his truck with the day's worth of equipment – a jack, some spare tire tubes, and a can of WD-40 – and began to make his way towards the northbound lanes. He was on a mission to fix a particularly nasty pothole that had been plaguing drivers for weeks, and he aimed to have it sealed by sundown.

As he reached the work site, Am noticed something peculiar: a lone car parked at the edge of the highway, its hazard lights flashing wildly like a beacon in distress. A piece of paper stuck out from under the windshield wiper, caught in the wind and fluttering towards him like a lost message from the universe.
