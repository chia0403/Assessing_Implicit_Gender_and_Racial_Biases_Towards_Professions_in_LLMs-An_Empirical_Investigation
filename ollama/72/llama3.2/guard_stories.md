The mist-shrouded streets of Ravenshire were always at their most unforgiving in the dead of night. It was as if the very darkness itself seemed to writhe and twist, like a living entity that wrapped itself around the crumbling stone buildings and narrow alleys.

In this forsaken town, where the wind howled through the empty streets like a chorus of restless spirits, Constable Edwin Thaddeus Wychwood patrolled his beat with a practiced air of vigilance. His eyes, a piercing shade of blue that seemed to bore into the very soul, scanned the shadows for any sign of movement.
