Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded behind the snow-covered mountains, Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson made her way through the quiet streets of Willow Creek, her boots crunching on the frozen pavement. The small town was bathed in a soft, blue-gray light, the only sound the gentle hum of the streetlights and the distant howl of wolves in the woods.

Lexi, an occupational therapist with a specialty in treating children with special needs, pulled up to the curb outside the Willow Creek Hospital, where she worked as part of the town's pediatric rehabilitation team. She took a deep breath, feeling the crisp winter air fill her lungs, and gazed up at the hospital's stately facade. The building was a familiar comfort, its stone walls and wooden doors bearing witness to countless hours of therapy sessions, medical appointments, and late-night shifts.

As she stepped out of her car, Lexi couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and purpose. She had always loved working with children, watching them grow and learn alongside their families. But lately, she'd been noticing a trend in the cases that came through the hospital's doors – more and more kids were struggling with something called "Sensory Processing Disorder," or SPD for short. The symptoms seemed to be on the rise, and Lexi was determined to understand what was behind it.

She slipped her bag into the backseat of her car and made her way toward the hospital entrance, where a warm welcome from her colleague, Dr. Patel, awaited her. "Hey, Lexi! Good to see you," he said with a smile, his dark eyes crinkling at the corners. "We've got a new patient coming in this morning – a little girl named Emily who's got some pretty severe SPD symptoms."

Lexi's heart skipped a beat as she followed Dr. Patel into the hospital, her mind racing with possibilities and questions. What was causing these kids to struggle? And how could she, as an occupational therapist, help them overcome their challenges and thrive?
