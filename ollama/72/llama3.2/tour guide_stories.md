Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the intricately carved fa√ßade of the Treasury Building. Amongst the throngs of tourists gathered before him, Dr. Amr Rashad Hassan, a seasoned tour guide with a passion for sharing the history and secrets of this majestic site, stood out as a knowledgeable and charismatic leader.

A native Jordanian born and raised in the town of Wadi Musa, Dr. Hassan had spent his life studying the ancient civilizations that once flourished within Petra's imposing walls. He had led countless tours through the narrow canyon known as the Siq, beneath the towering monoliths of Al-Khazneh and Ad Deir, and into the heart of the Temple Mountain. But tonight was different - tonight, he sensed a restlessness in the air, a sense that something was about to change.

As Dr. Hassan stood before his group, a young woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair wandered away from the crowd, her gaze drawn to the Treasury Building as if it held some hidden secret. Little did she know, this was only the beginning of an adventure that would take her - and Dr. Hassan - on a journey through time, mystery, and danger.
