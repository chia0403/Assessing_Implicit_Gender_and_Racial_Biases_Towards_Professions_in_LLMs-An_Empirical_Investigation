Here's a potential story opening and setting for a mystery or thriller novel:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Detective Emilia Victoria Wellesley stepped out of the gloom of her office building and onto the sidewalk. The misty veil that shrouded the city seemed to cling to her skin, mirroring the unease that had been growing inside her since she received the cryptic phone call earlier that morning.

Emilia, a sharp-witted and fiercely independent lawyer, had always prided herself on being able to navigate even the most complex cases with ease. But this particular case had her stumped – a missing persons investigation that seemed to be shrouded in more questions than answers. The only clue was a cryptic message scrawled on a piece of paper found at the scene: "The truth lies in the shadows."

As she lit a cigarette, the acrid smoke mingling with the misty air, Emilia couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off about this case. And yet, it was precisely this sense of unease that drove her to take on the challenge – to unravel the tangled threads of this mystery and uncover the truth, no matter how sinister it might be.

The streets of Seattle seemed to stretch out before her like a dark canvas, waiting to be filled with the brushstrokes of justice. Emilia took a long drag on her cigarette, feeling the nicotine coursing through her veins as she set off into the unknown, ready to face whatever lay ahead.
