Here's a potential story opening:

The stormy night air clung to Dr. Emily Jane Thompson like a damp shroud as she stepped out of her small apartment and into the chill of the New Orleans streets. The flickering streetlights cast eerie shadows on the wet pavement, and the distant rumble of thunder echoed through the canals and cypress-lined streets. It was a night that seemed tailor-made for disaster - and tonight was shaping up to be no exception.

Emily, a seasoned ER doctor with years of experience under her belt, had just received a frantic call from the city's emergency dispatch center. A massive fire was tearing through the 9th Ward, threatening to engulf entire blocks of homes and businesses. The dispatcher's words still echoed in Emily's mind: "Multiple patients reported, possible fatalities...we need you on scene ASAP."

With her medical bag slung over her shoulder and a sense of foreboding growing in her chest, Emily made her way towards the hospital, knowing that this was going to be a long and bloody night.

The city's ER was already buzzing with activity as Emily arrived, the sound of sirens and panicked voices filling the air. She knew she had to move fast - every minute counted in a disaster scenario like this one. With a deep breath, she pushed open the swinging doors and stepped into the chaos within, ready to face whatever horrors lay ahead.
