Here's a story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a tiny bungalow on Elm Street, Jack Harrison Harris, 32, a ruggedly handsome roofer with a strong jawline and a mop of messy brown hair, was finishing up his last job of the day.

As he stepped back to admire his handiwork, a sense of satisfaction washed over him. He had replaced the leaky shingles on Mrs. Jenkins' roof just in time for her upcoming garden party, and now the house looked better than ever. Jack took a deep breath, feeling the cool evening air fill his lungs, and began to pack up his tools.

But as he worked, Jack's mind kept wandering back to the strange occurrences that had been happening around town lately. Tools gone missing from his own truck, mysterious noises in the night, and an eerie feeling that someone was watching him. He shook off the thoughts, telling himself it was just small-town paranoia, but a nagging sense of unease lingered.

As he walked back to his truck, Jack's eyes landed on a piece of paper taped to the windshield. A cryptic message scrawled in red ink read: "They're coming for you."
