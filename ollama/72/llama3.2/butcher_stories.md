Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Here, 32-year-old Emilia "Mia" Hampton spent her days crafting beautiful works of art from raw meat. As the owner and head butcher, Mia took pride in her work, carefully selecting each cut and trimming it with precision to bring out its natural flavors.

As she worked, the scent of freshly ground beef and cured sausages wafted through the shop, mingling with the faint tang of blood and the earthy smell of fresh herbs from the market.

Mia couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just a prank, and that something sinister lurked in the shadows of Ravenshire. Little did she know, her life was about to take a dramatic turn...
