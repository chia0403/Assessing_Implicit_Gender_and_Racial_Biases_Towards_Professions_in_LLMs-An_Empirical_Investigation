Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished leather as Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her apartment building, wrapping her scarf tightly around her neck to ward off the chill. She took a deep breath, feeling the damp air fill her lungs, and began her walk to the office of Jenkins & Associates, where she worked as a paralegal.

As she walked, Lexi's eyes scanned the streets, taking in the familiar sights of the city. The sounds of the city – car horns, chatter, and the wail of sirens in the distance – created a symphony that was both calming and overwhelming. She felt at home here, in this concrete jungle, where the rain seemed to wash away the world's troubles.

Lexi had always been drawn to the law, and after completing her paralegal studies at a local community college, she landed a job at Jenkins & Associates, one of Seattle's most respected law firms. Her boss, Mr. Jenkins, was a fair man who had taken Lexi under his wing, teaching her the ins and outs of the courtroom and introducing her to some of the city's most prominent lawyers.

But today was different. Today was the day that Lexi would face her toughest challenge yet – she had just been assigned to work with one of Jenkins & Associates' most high-profile clients, a wealthy businessman who was being sued for embezzlement. And as Lexi walked into the office building, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Little did she know, this case would change her life forever...
