Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of fog lifted off the cobblestone streets of 1895 Paris, Aurora Élise Dupont stretched her slender frame and yawned, revealing a scattering of freckles across her cheeks. With a flick of her raven-black hair, she made her way to the grand entrance of the Hôtel de la Paix, where the soft glow of candlelight beckoned like a warm hug.

Aurora Élise had worked as the concierge for nearly five years, and in that time, she'd developed an uncanny ability to read the desires of each guest who wandered through those doors. She knew which champagne was needed to soothe a heartbroken soul, which perfume to calm the nerves of a high-strung aristocrat, and which discreet conversation could keep a sensitive topic out of ears that shouldn't be listening.

Tonight was no different from any other – save for the whispered rumor of a mysterious ballerina, one who would stop at nothing to claim the spotlight on the city's most prestigious stage. As Aurora Élise prepared for another evening of hosting the Hôtel de la Paix's esteemed guests, she couldn't shake the feeling that something more was about to unfold beneath the City of Light's glittering facade.

The night air swirled with secrets and scandals, and Aurora Élise's keen ear was tuned to catch every whispered word – a skill that would soon prove invaluable in unraveling the tangled threads of an intrigue that would shake the very foundations of Paris' high society.
