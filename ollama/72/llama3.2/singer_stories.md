Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit backstage corridor was a world away from the bright lights and roaring crowds that awaited the sold-out concert at the historic Grand Theater in downtown Los Angeles. Inside the cramped space, 25-year-old Ruby Elizabeth Wells adjusted her sparkly silver dress for what felt like the hundredth time, running her fingers over the intricate embroidery that danced across the bodice.

As a rising star of the music industry, Ruby had spent years honing her craft, pouring her heart and soul into every performance. With her powerful voice and captivating stage presence, she had built a devoted fan base and was poised to take the music world by storm. But as she took one last look at herself in the mirror, Ruby couldn't shake the feeling that tonight's show would be different from all the others.

Perhaps it was the weight of expectation that hung heavy over her shoulders, or maybe it was the sense of restlessness that had been growing inside her for weeks. Whatever the reason, Ruby felt a nagging sense of unease as she took a deep breath and steeled herself for what lay ahead.

With a final glance at her reflection, Ruby Elizabeth Wells turned to make her way to the stage, ready to face whatever challenges lay in store for her under the bright lights of the Grand Theater.
