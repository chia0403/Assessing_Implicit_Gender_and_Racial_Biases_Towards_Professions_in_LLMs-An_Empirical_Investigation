Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the small coastal town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy streets and weathered buildings. The smell of saltwater and fish fries wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of seagulls crying overhead.

 Inside the cozy, family-owned restaurant, 'The Wharfside', the evening rush was in full swing. Server Emilia Mae Taylor expertly juggled multiple tables at once, her bright pink hair tied back in a neat ponytail as she delivered plate after plate of seafood favorites to grateful patrons.

As she navigated the crowded dining area, Emilia's eyes scanned the room with practiced efficiency, her mind focused on ensuring every customer left feeling like they'd just been treated to a little slice of heaven. With years of experience under her belt and a natural talent for making people feel at home, Emilia had become an institution in Ravenswood - the go-to server for special occasions and everyday meals alike.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Emilia's thoughts were elsewhere.
