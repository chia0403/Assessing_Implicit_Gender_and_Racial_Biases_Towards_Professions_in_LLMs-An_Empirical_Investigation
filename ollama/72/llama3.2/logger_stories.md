Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The misty dawn crept over the small town of Ravenswood, Oregon, shrouding its residents in an eerie silence. The only sound was the soft creaking of the old trees and the distant rumble of the Columbia River. In the heart of this tranquil community, Jack Austin McAllister, a rugged logger with arms like oak and eyes that seemed to hold a thousand stories, stirred from his slumber.

Jack had spent his entire life in Ravenswood, where his family had built their logging business from scratch. He was a third-generation logger, just as his great-grandfather had been before him. Jack's days were filled with the thrill of discovery and the satisfaction of harvesting timber from the ancient forests that surrounded the town. As he rose from his bed, Jack's gaze fell upon the worn photograph on his nightstand - a picture of himself as a young boy, standing proudly beside his grandfather in front of their family's old logging camp.

As he began to get dressed for another day in the woods, Jack couldn't shake off the feeling that something was amiss. A sense of unease had settled in the pit of his stomach since his last trip into the forest, where he'd stumbled upon an eerie, unexplained symbol carved into the trunk of a giant fir tree. The mark seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy, and Jack couldn't help but wonder what it might mean.

The air outside was crisp and cold as Jack stepped out onto the porch, taking in the breathtaking view of the forest stretching before him like a green canvas. He took a deep breath, feeling the dampness fill his lungs, and knew that today would be just another day in the woods, but little did he know, this day would change everything.

How's that? I can make adjustments or continue the story if you'd like!
