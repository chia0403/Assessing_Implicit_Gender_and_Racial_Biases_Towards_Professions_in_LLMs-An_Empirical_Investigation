Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the lake, gazing out at the mist-shrouded waters as the first light of dawn began to creep over the trees. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. It was a typical autumn morning in the small town of Willow Creek, where Lexi had returned after a decade away to take up a position at the local university's counseling psychology department.

Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the familiar mix of emotions that always arose when she returned to this place. There was a sense of closure, a feeling that she'd finally found her way back home after years of wandering. But there was also a tinge of sadness, a reminder of what she'd left behind: the memories of her past life, the relationships she'd broken off, and the dreams she'd put on hold.

As she gazed out at the lake, Lexi's mind began to wander back to the case that had brought her back to Willow Creek in the first place. A young woman named Sarah, who'd been referred to Lexi's department for therapy after a near-fatal car accident. The accident had left Sarah with severe PTSD and a deep-seated fear of the road, an experience that Lexi was determined to help her work through.

But as she stood there on this misty morning, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease lingered at the edges of her mind, like a whisper from the past. She knew it would have to wait â€“ for now, she had patients to see and therapy sessions to conduct. But as she turned to head back towards her office, Lexi couldn't help but feel that this was just the beginning of something much bigger.
