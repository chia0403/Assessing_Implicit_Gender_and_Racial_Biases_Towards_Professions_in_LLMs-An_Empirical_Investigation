Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving on Wednesdays. As if the gloom itself was conspiring against the city's inhabitants, draining what little joy from the day. But for Emily Jane Wilson, salesperson extraordinaire at the prestigious marketing firm, Wilson & Co., Wednesday was just another day in the trenches.

Emily's high heels clicked on the polished marble floor of the office building as she made her way to the conference room for her morning meeting with potential clients from a major tech startup. She had spent hours prepping for this pitch, perfecting her presentation and rehearsing her sales lines until they felt like second nature. But as she glanced out the window at the rain-lashed streets below, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that this deal was going to be a tough sell.

As she took her seat at the conference table, Emily's gaze met those of her colleagues, all of whom seemed just as battle-hardened and determined as she was. There was Jack, the firm's resident tech expert; Rachel, the marketing guru with a gift for crafting compelling narratives; and Tom, the CEO himself, who had a reputation for being both ruthless and brilliant in his pursuit of success.

Together, they formed a formidable team, each one bringing their unique skills to the table as they prepared to face off against the competition for this lucrative contract. But as Emily began her pitch, she couldn't help but wonder: would their hard work be enough to convince the clients that Wilson & Co. was the right choice for them?
