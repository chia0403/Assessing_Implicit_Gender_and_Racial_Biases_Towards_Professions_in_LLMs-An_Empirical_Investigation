Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the playground, watching as a group of rowdy fifth-graders took a break from their lunchtime recess to engage in an impromptu game of tag. The sun was shining down on the worn asphalt, casting long shadows across the swings and slide. The sound of children's laughter and shouts filled the air, a cacophony that Lexi had grown accustomed to over her years as a school psychologist at Oakwood Elementary.

As she surveyed the scene, Lexi's mind wandered to the upcoming meeting with the principal, Mrs. Jenkins. There was something brewing in the district office, something that had Lexi's antennae twitching with concern. The whispers of staff members and parents alike hinted at changes on the horizon, but no one seemed willing to discuss specifics.

Lexi took a deep breath, letting the scent of fresh-cut grass and sunshine wash over her. She loved this time of day, when the chaos of the school day had yet to settle in, and she could still find moments of peace amidst the pandemonium. But as she turned to head back into the building, her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her colleague, Dr. Patel.

"Lexi, you need to see this," the message read. "Meet me in my office after school."
