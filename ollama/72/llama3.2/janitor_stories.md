Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare over the dusty floors and worn linoleum of Oakwood High School's corridors. It was 3:45 PM on a typical Friday afternoon, with only the sound of murmuring students and clattering lockers breaking the monotony. Amidst this chaos, one figure moved with purpose, her eyes scanning the floor for dust bunnies and lost Cheerio crumbs.

Aurora "Rory" Wembly, a 17-year-old janitor at Oakwood High, pushed her cart through the hallways, her worn sneakers squeaking on the polished floors. She had been working here since her freshman year, and while some might see it as an unglamorous job, Rory found comfort in the rhythm of cleaning up after others - a chance to impose order on chaos.

As she made her way to the staff room for her final pre-summer break check-in, Rory's gaze wandered out into the parking lot. The late sunlight cast long shadows across the asphalt, and she spotted a sleek black sedan parked by the corner of the school entrance. A message scrawled on the windshield in hasty letters read: "MEET ME @ 4".

Rory raised an eyebrow, her curiosity piqued. Who could be meeting whom at this hour? And what did it have to do with her?
