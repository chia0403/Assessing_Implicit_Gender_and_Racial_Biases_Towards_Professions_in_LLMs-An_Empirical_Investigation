The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rosalind Prescott's head, casting a sterile glow over the mismatched furniture in her tiny office.  Papers cluttered every surface â€“ college applications, permission slips, half-finished lesson plans on navigating social media anxieties. The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and teenage desperation. 

Amelia leaned back in her creaky chair, watching the clock tick down the last fifteen minutes of her day. Another Tuesday at Northwood High School, another avalanche of emotional baggage deposited on her desk. She sighed, wishing she could escape the beige walls and fluorescent hum for a quiet evening with a good book and a glass of wine. 

Suddenly, the door swung open, interrupting her thoughts. A lanky boy with dark circles under his eyes and hair that resembled a bird's nest stood awkwardly in the doorway. He clutched a crumpled permission slip in one hand, his knuckles white with tension. 


"Ms. Prescott?" he mumbled, his voice barely audible over the distant drone of a classroom bell. "It's... about the psychology club."
