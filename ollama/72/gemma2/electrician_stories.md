The humid July air clung to Alistair Finch like a damp shroud as he stepped out of his beat-up Ford pickup.  Sweat beaded on his brow despite the worn baseball cap shading his eyes. The smell of ozone and freshly cut grass hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of metal that was always present in this part of town. 

Alistair squinted at the dilapidated Victorian mansion looming before him, its once-grand facade now marred by peeling paint and overgrown ivy. A swarm of cicadas buzzed incessantly from the oak trees lining the overgrown driveway. This wasn't Alistair's usual clientele â€“ he was more accustomed to fixing flickering lights in modest bungalows and wiring new extensions for suburban homes. But Mrs. Davenport, the elderly owner, had called with a peculiar request: something about "electrical whispers" and a "ghostly chill."

Alistair scoffed under his breath. Ghosts were for ghost hunters, not electricians. He was here to deal with faulty wiring, not figments of imagination. Still, curiosity gnawed at him. Perhaps Mrs. Davenport had simply misconstrued a loose connection as something supernatural. 


He pulled out his trusty toolkit and headed up the overgrown path, his boots crunching on gravel beneath his feet. The air seemed to grow colder as he approached the house, sending a shiver down his spine despite the oppressive heat.
