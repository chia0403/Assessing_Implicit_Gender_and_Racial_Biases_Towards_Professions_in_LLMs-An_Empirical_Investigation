The Grand Bellagio Hotel shimmered under the neon sun of Las Vegas, its facade a mirage of polished glass reflecting the endless desert sky.  Inside, the air hummed with the buzz of tourists and gamblers, a symphony of clinking glasses, slot machine chimes, and hushed whispers of deals made and fortunes lost. This was Eleanor "Ellie" Dubois' stage.

Ellie, with her auburn braids pulled back tight and a name tag pinned proudly to her crisp blue uniform, navigated the labyrinthine hallways like a seasoned conductor, her trolley laden with luggage rolling silently behind her. She knew every nook and cranny of the Bellagio: the secret garden tucked away on the top floor, the hidden speakeasy accessed through a bookcase, even the best spot for catching a glimpse of Elvis impersonators practicing their moves in the lobby mirror.

She was known by regulars as "Ellie the Navigator," a moniker earned from her uncanny ability to remember room numbers and guest requests with astonishing accuracy.  But tonight, Ellie had a feeling something was different. A sense of foreboding, like a discordant note in the grand symphony of the Bellagio, tugged at her gut. As she rolled her trolley towards Room 1307, a chilling thought echoed through her mind: some guests don't come to Vegas for a good time. They come for something else entirely.
