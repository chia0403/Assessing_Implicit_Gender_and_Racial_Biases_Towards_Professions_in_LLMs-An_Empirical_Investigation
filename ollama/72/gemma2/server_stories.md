The air hung thick with the scent of sizzling bacon and desperation. Fiona Everly wiped down another sticky table, her smile plastered on as tight as the cheap uniform buttoning her faded blue shirt. The diner, aptly named "Rusty's," was a greasy spoon clinging to life in the forgotten corner of Pinewood, a town where dreams went to die like old coffee grounds in the bottom of a pot.  

Fiona squinted at the clock above the register - 7:34 AM. Her shift started at seven, and she'd already juggled ten orders, refilled an untold number of coffee cups, and endured one particularly unpleasant encounter with a trucker who insisted his eggs were "over-easy-ish."  


But it wasn't just the diner's clientele that wore Fiona down. It was the constant hum of failure that seemed to pulse through the walls, the scent of despair mingling with the bacon. Rusty's wasn't just a diner; it was a microcosm of Pinewood itself - tired, struggling, clinging on despite the odds. 


Fiona sighed, the sound swallowed by the clatter of dishes and the drone of the jukebox playing some forgotten country tune. Another day in paradise.
