The air in Room 214 hung thick with the smell of burnt popcorn and teenage apathy.  It wasn't unusual for this to happen on Mondays - especially after Homecoming weekend. Elara Beatrice Vance surveyed her classroom with a practiced eye, her gaze sweeping past posters promoting recycling and Shakespearean sonnets, landing finally on the snoozing student slumped over his desk. He was clutching a crumpled paper bag that reeked of last night's festivities. 

Elara sighed, tapping her red pen against her clipboard. She loved teaching history, she truly did.  The stories, the personalities, the unraveling of past events â€“ it captivated her. But sometimes, especially in this particular classroom filled with hormonally-charged teenagers who seemed more interested in their phones than the Peloponnesian War, even Elara's passion felt like a flickering candle flame threatened by the draft.


The bell shrieked, jolting the sleeping student awake and sending a ripple of restless energy through the room.  Elara, however, remained unfazed. She had faced worse Mondays.
