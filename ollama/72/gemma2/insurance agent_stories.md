The rain hammered on the corrugated tin roof like a thousand tiny fists, each blow punctuated by a thunderclap that rattled the windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling's office.  He hunched over his desk, the flickering fluorescent light reflecting in the sheen of his receding hairline. Outside, the streets of Bayou Rouge were awash, the murky brown water lapping at the edges of the floodgates he’d just seen raised earlier that afternoon. 

Bart wasn't worried about the storm itself. He lived for these types of Louisiana downpours, the way they brought a hush to the boisterous life of his town and forced everyone, from the gumbo-slinging cooks at Mama Rose’s Kitchen to the crawfish-trapping fishermen, into a shared sense of weathering together. What worried him was what came after. 

The storm would pass, but then the calls would start. Claims. Desperation. Broken dreams wrapped in soggy drywall and waterlogged furniture. That's where Bart came in –  the calm amidst the chaos, the voice of reason when their world had gone topsy-turvy. He was a lifeline for people whose lives were suddenly upended by misfortune, an insurance agent who believed in more than just policy numbers and actuarial tables; he believed in people. 


He sighed, pushing aside the half-empty coffee mug that had grown cold. Another storm, another chance to prove it.
