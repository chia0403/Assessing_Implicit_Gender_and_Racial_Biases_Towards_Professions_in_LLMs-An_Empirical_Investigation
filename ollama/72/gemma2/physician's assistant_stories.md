The humid Florida air clung to Elara Rose Beaumont like a second skin as she walked through the bustling marketplace. Mangoes spilled from wicker baskets, their vibrant yellow skins glistening in the midday sun. The scent of roasting plantains mingled with the salty tang of the nearby ocean, creating a heady aroma that was both familiar and intoxicating. Elara navigated the throngs of tourists and locals with practiced ease, her eyes scanning for her patient's stall – a small, unassuming booth tucked between a purveyor of handcrafted jewelry and a woman selling brightly dyed scarves. 

Elara wasn't here to haggle for souvenirs or sample exotic fruits. As a physician’s assistant at the local clinic in this vibrant Caribbean village, she was called upon for ailments ranging from sunburn to severe infections. Her patient today was Mrs. Avila, a beloved elder known for her intricate woven baskets and her generous spirit. 


Today's consultation wouldn't be about rashes or splinters; it felt different. A tremor of worry vibrated beneath Elara’s calm facade.  Mrs. Avila had been complaining of persistent headaches and a fatigue that seemed to sap her very life force. The village elder, usually a beacon of energy, had become withdrawn, shrouded in an unsettling pallor.
