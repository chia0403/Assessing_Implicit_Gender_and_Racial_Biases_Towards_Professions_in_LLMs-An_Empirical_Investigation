The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of the open house. Sunlight, filtered through gauzy curtains, illuminated dust motes dancing in the otherwise empty living room. Amelia Beaumont, her blonde ponytail pulled back tight against the rising humidity, plastered on a smile as another couple shuffled through the property, their faces etched with the same weary indecision she’d seen countless times before. 

This wasn't the glamorous world of penthouse suites and waterfront mansions Amelia had envisioned when she first started in real estate five years ago. This was Elmwood Heights, a quiet suburb slowly losing its charm to creeping blight and shrinking budgets. The three-bedroom ranch house she was showcasing today was a prime example: peeling paint, a questionable carpet, and the lingering scent of damp basement.  

But Amelia knew every nook and cranny of this town. She knew the stories hidden behind boarded-up windows, the dreams clinging desperately to threadbare couches. And somewhere beneath the disillusionment, she still believed in the magic of finding the perfect place for someone, a home that could hold their hopes and anxieties, their laughter and tears. 


Amelia just hoped today's open house wouldn’t end like all the others - with empty promises and another disappointed homeowner.
