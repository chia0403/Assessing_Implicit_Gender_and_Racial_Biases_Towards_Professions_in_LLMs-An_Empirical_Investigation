The sterile white walls of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office seemed to amplify the silence in the room. The only sound was the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner, its pendulum swinging like a metronome keeping time with Evelyn's growing unease.  It was always quiet before her patients arrived, but this morning, the stillness felt heavier, more pregnant with unspoken anxieties. She took a deep breath, smoothing down the wrinkles on her crisp navy blouse, and tried to focus on the stack of case files waiting on her desk. 

Her practice, nestled in a quiet corner of Portland's historic district, was usually a haven for troubled souls seeking solace and understanding. But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unsettling tension, a subtle shift in the familiar energy that had always greeted her here.


Evelyn glanced at the window overlooking the cobblestone street. A solitary figure huddled under a tattered umbrella, their face obscured by the shadows cast by a passing delivery truck.  She frowned, sensing a connection between this stranger and the heavy silence that permeated her office.
