The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and simmering anxiety. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of Havenwood Rehabilitation Center, illuminating motes dancing in the silence.  Eleanor "Ellie" Amelia Blackwood, her clipboard clutched like a lifeline, smoothed down her wrinkled scrubs and took a deep breath. The rhythmic whirring of an oxygen machine was the only sound that broke the stillness of the long hallway.

Havenwood wasn't exactly bustling with life. It felt more like a forgotten corner of the world, tucked away in the rambling outskirts of Willow Creek, its once vibrant paint faded to a mournful grey. Ellie loved working here. She found solace in tending to the broken pieces – both physical and emotional – of those who called Havenwood home.

Today, her focus was on Mr. Arthur Peterson, a retired carpenter whose life had been irrevocably altered by a stroke six months prior. His room, decorated with faded photographs and dust-covered trophies from his woodworking days, echoed with the ghosts of his former vibrancy. 


Ellie knew that today's session would be crucial.  Mr. Peterson had been resisting therapy, clinging to the remnants of his past self like a life raft in a storm. Ellie hoped, against all odds, that she could convince him to let go and fight for the future. The fate of Mr. Peterson’s recovery, and perhaps even his spirit, rested on her shoulders.
