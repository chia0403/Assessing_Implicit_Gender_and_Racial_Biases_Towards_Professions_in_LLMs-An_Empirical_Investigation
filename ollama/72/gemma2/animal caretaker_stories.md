The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty paddock as Amelia “Amy” Thistlewood surveyed her charges. The air, thick with the scent of hay and manure, carried the bleating of sheep and the occasional whinny from the waiting horses. Amy adjusted her faded denim hat and sighed, a wave of exhaustion washing over her. It had been a long day already, starting before dawn with the milking of Bessie, the grumpy but reliable Jersey cow, followed by tending to the chicks huddled in their heated brooder. Now, with the sun dipping below the horizon, she still had to feed the pigs, mend the broken fence post in the chicken coop, and collect eggs before nightfall.

Amy's sanctuary, Thistlewood Farm, was a small haven nestled on the outskirts of Oakhaven, a sleepy town tucked away in the rolling hills of Vermont. It wasn’t much, but it was her lifeblood - a tapestry woven with the threads of responsibility, love for her animals, and a stubborn refusal to let go of a dream. 


It had been a dream passed down through generations of Thistlewoods, each owner leaving their mark on the land and its creatures. But lately, the weight of keeping the farm afloat had felt heavier than ever. The dwindling number of customers at the weekly farmers market, rising feed costs, and the ever-present threat of the encroaching development on the outskirts of town were chipping away at Amy's hope.
