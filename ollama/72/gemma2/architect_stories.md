The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Eleanor Amelia Brighton, her brow damp with perspiration despite the shade provided by the sprawling oak tree, squinted at the crumbling facade of the old theatre.  

Built in 1924, the Grand Majestic had once been a beacon of art and entertainment, its ornate facade shimmering under the golden glow of Atlanta’s gaslights. Now, it stood as a silent sentinel, boarded windows staring blankly into the bustling city that had grown around it. Eleanor ran a gloved hand over the rough brick, feeling the chill seep through her cotton gloves. 

She was here on a mission: to breathe life back into this decaying monument to a bygone era. Her firm, Brighton & Associates, had been chosen for the ambitious project, tasked with restoring the Grand Majestic to its former glory. It was a dream job for Eleanor, a chance to prove herself not just as an architect but as a champion of Atlanta’s history. 


But beneath the thrill of this opportunity lurked a shadow of doubt. The theatre held whispers of tragedy, tales of a forgotten actress and a fire that had ravaged the building decades ago.  Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that she was stepping into more than just an old building; she was entering a story waiting to be told.
