Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her patient.  The air hung heavy with unspoken tension, thick enough to choke on.  Eleanor’s office, usually a sanctuary of soft lighting and calming lavender scents, felt more like a pressure cooker tonight. 

Across from her sat Michael Thorne, a man sculpted by anxieties, his hands clenched so tightly his knuckles were white. He was a rising star in the tech world, hailed as a visionary, but behind the polished facade, Eleanor sensed a darkness gnawing at him. His eyes, usually bright and sharp, held a dull ache that whispered of sleepless nights and relentless fears. 

The city outside hummed with its usual cacophony – sirens wailing, horns blaring, laughter echoing – yet within these four walls, time seemed to stand still.  Eleanor took a deep breath, the scent of rain and lavender mingling in her nostrils, grounding her. The storm wouldn't subside until they faced it together. 


"Tell me what's bringing you here tonight, Michael," she said softly, her voice a beacon of calm in the tempestuous room.
