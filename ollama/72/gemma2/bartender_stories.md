The neon "Open" sign buzzed with a tired hum, casting a sickly green glow across the sticky mahogany bartop. Rain lashed against the windows of The Rusty Tankard, blurring the streetlights into shimmering halos. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Finch wiped down a glass, her movements practiced and precise after years behind the counter. The usual Thursday night crowd was sparse – a few weary businessmen nursing pints of ale, a lone woman hunched over a crossword puzzle, and a biker trio huddled in the corner, their conversation punctuated by the clinking of ice. Amy knew them all by name, their stories etched into the worn wood of the bar like faded tattoos.  She poured herself a shot of whiskey – her own brand of rebellion against the dreary night – and took a long pull, savoring the burn that warmed her chest. It wasn’t much, but it was enough to keep the chill at bay. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Amy glanced up, curiosity piqued. A man stood on the threshold, his silhouette framed against the storm-ravaged night. He was tall and broad-shouldered, his face obscured by the shadows of a wide-brimmed hat. 


This wasn’t The Rusty Tankard’s usual clientele. This was someone new, someone who carried secrets in his stride and stories in his eyes. And Amy Finch had a knack for hearing them all.
