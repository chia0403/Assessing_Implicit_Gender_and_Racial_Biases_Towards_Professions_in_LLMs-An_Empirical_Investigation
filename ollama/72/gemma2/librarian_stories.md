The air in the Grand Blackwood Library hung heavy with the scent of aged paper and dust motes danced in the golden rays filtering through stained-glass windows depicting fantastical creatures. Eleanor Penelope Thistlewick, Head Librarian for the past twenty years, adjusted her spectacles and surveyed her domain with a practiced eye. The shelves, towering like ancient sentinels, groaned under the weight of countless volumes, whispering tales both forgotten and yet to be discovered. 

Eleanor ran a gloved finger along the spine of a leather-bound first edition, its gilded lettering barely visible beneath years of wear. It was a Saturday morning, usually the quietest time in the library, but today felt different. A disquiet hummed beneath the usual peaceful stillness, like a discordant note in an otherwise harmonious melody. Eleanor couldn't quite place it, but something – or perhaps someone – had shifted the balance of her beloved sanctuary.
