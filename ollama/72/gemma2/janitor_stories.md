The rhythmic squeak of Elara Mae Hawthorne's mop echoed through the cavernous, abandoned music hall. Dust motes danced in the slivers of sunlight that pierced through grimy windows, illuminating swirling patterns on the faded velvet curtains. A grand piano, its once gleaming ebony finish dulled with time, loomed like a silent sentinel at the far end of the stage, its ivory keys yellowed and cracked. Elara, her worn denim overalls dusted with cobwebs, paused in her work, tilting her head to listen. The silence was broken only by the distant rumble of traffic outside, a faint reminder that the world still spun beyond these walls.  


It had been years since the last performance graced this stage, years since the laughter and applause had filled this space. Now, it belonged to Elara and the ghosts of forgotten melodies.
