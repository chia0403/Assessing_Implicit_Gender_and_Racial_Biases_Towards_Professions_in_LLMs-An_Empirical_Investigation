The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thorne's head, casting a sterile glow on the linoleum floor.  Outside her cramped office window, the late afternoon sun painted streaks of orange across the sprawling campus of Northwood High School. Inside, Amelia sat at her desk, the gentle clinking of her teacup against its saucer the only sound besides the distant murmur of teenagers navigating the hallways. 

Her latest referral lay on her desk: 16-year-old Daniel Hayes, suspected of cyberbullying and exhibiting signs of escalating anxiety. A knot of familiar unease tightened in Amelia's chest. She knew this scenario all too well - a tangled web of adolescent emotions woven with the threads of social media, fear, and isolation. Today was another day on the front lines of teenage angst, another opportunity to navigate the labyrinth of their minds and help them find their way back to the light. 


The air in her office felt thick with anticipation. The first bell for dismissal would ring soon, ushering in a new wave of anxieties, dreams, and vulnerabilities that Amelia was about to face head-on.
