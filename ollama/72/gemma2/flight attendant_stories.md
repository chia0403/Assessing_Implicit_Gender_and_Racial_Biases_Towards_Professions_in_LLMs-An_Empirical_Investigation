The air inside the Boeing 747 hummed with a low thrum, a constant reminder that Amelia Beatrice Winthrop was hurtling thousands of feet above the earth. Her smile felt plastered on as she served coffee to passengers in their cramped seats, the familiar script of safety instructions echoing in her mind like a broken record.  

Amelia preferred the quiet solitude of pre-flight preparations. Checking oxygen masks, ensuring emergency exits were clear, double-checking her meticulously color-coded trolley - these tasks brought a sense of order to a world that often felt chaotic. But now, with the cabin lights dimmed and the plane gliding through a sea of clouds, she was trapped in a dance of forced cheerfulness. The only solace came from the rhythmic thrum of the engines and the faint scent of jet fuel, a heady aroma that always reminded her of adventure. 

Tonight's flight was Tokyo to New York, a journey Amelia had made countless times before. Yet, something felt different this time. Perhaps it was the way the moon cast an ethereal glow through the tiny porthole windows, or the unusual silence from the passengers, as if they were all holding their breaths, waiting for something unknown to unfold. 


Amelia took a deep breath, reminding herself to focus on her duties. After all, she was Amelia Beatrice Winthrop, a seasoned flight attendant with a reputation for unflappability.  She had faced turbulence, crying babies, and demanding passengers â€“ surely a little unease in the air wasn't going to faze her.
