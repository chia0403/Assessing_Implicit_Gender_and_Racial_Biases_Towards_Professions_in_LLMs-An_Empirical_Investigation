The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of red vinyl chairs that lined the waiting area. The scent of antiseptic hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of stale coffee from the vending machine in the corner.

Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Another Tuesday morning at Mercy General Hospital. She glanced down at the tray strapped to her arm â€“ vials filled with blood samples, each one a tiny universe containing secrets about its owner's health. The prickle of needles against her skin was familiar, almost comforting.

Ellie was a phlebotomist, a master extractor of life's essence. Some found her job morbid, others clinical. But Ellie saw it as an art form, a delicate dance between needle and vein. She prided herself on her gentle touch, the way she could calm even the most anxious patient with a reassuring smile and a calming voice.  But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced down her spine, mirroring the sharp edge of the needles in her tray. 


The waiting area door hissed open, and a new patient entered. He was tall and lanky, dressed in a rumpled suit that seemed too big for his frame. His eyes darted nervously around the room, settling finally on Ellie. A shiver ran down her spine. There was something unsettling about him, a darkness lurking beneath his surface. 

Ellie took a deep breath, steeling herself. Another day, another patient. But this time, she had a feeling it wouldn't be an ordinary draw.
