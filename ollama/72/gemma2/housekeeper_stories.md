The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender polish and stale cigarette smoke in the cavernous Victorian mansion. Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, known affectionately by the family as Ellie, meticulously dusted the antique gramophone, its polished brass gleaming under the dim glow of the sun filtering through stained-glass windows.

The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient panes and making the house creak ominously. Ellie paused, listening to the symphony of the tempest, a familiar comfort in her otherwise silent life. This grand old house, with its secrets whispered through dusty portraits and faded tapestries, was her sanctuary.
