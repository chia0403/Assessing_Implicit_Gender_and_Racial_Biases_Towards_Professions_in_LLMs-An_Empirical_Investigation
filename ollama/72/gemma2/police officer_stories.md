The air hung thick with humidity, even at 7:00 AM, as Officer Amelia Rose Hawthorne stepped out of her cruiser. The late summer heat pressed down on New Orleans like an unwelcome blanket, shimmering off the slick asphalt of St. Charles Avenue. Spanish moss draped from ancient oak trees, their leaves rustling in a lazy breeze that offered little relief from the oppressive mugginess. 

Amelia squinted at the scene before her: a lone figure slumped against a wrought iron bench in front of the Jackson Square cafe, his head lolling at an unnatural angle. Her partner, a gruff veteran named Detective James "Jimmy" LeBlanc, was already on the scene, his tall frame casting a long shadow as he knelt beside the body. 


A bead of sweat trickled down Amelia's temple, mingling with the traces of her morning coffee. The city felt heavy today, pregnant with an unspoken tension that only intensified under the relentless sun. A chill snaked up her spine, despite the heat, a feeling she knew all too well - the unsettling premonition of another case gone wrong in this vibrant but deeply troubled city.
