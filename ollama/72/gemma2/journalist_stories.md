The flickering neon sign outside "Rosie's Diner" cast an oily rainbow across Elara Kensington's rain-slicked trench coat.  She inhaled deeply, the aroma of fried onions and burnt coffee a familiar comfort amidst the gritty symphony of the city: car horns blaring, sirens wailing, and the distant rumble of the metro.  

Elara pushed open the door, its chime announcing her arrival to the half-dozen patrons scattered across the worn vinyl booths. The diner felt timeless, frozen in a decade she could never pinpoint - maybe the 50s, maybe the 70s, but definitely before the city had devoured it whole. She pulled out her battered notebook and pen, ready for another night of unraveling stories buried beneath layers of grease and despair.  This time, her quarry was Mayor Thorne's alleged ties to a shadowy offshore bank account. A whisper in the wind, maybe, or a lead that could bring down the city's most powerful man. Elara Kensington wasn't afraid of whispers. She was built on them.
