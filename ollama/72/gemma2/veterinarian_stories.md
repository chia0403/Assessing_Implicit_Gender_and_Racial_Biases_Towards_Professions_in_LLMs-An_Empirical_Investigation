The rain lashed against Dr. Elara Vance's windows, each drop exploding on the glass like a miniature bomb.  Thunder grumbled in the distance, a low, guttural growl that mirrored the anxiety churning in her stomach. Her small animal clinic, nestled in a quaint, cobblestone-lined street in the heart of Edinburgh, was unusually quiet this evening. Usually, by eight o'clock, the waiting room would be bustling with worried pet owners and their furry companions. But tonight, only the rhythmic patter of rain filled the air.

Elara glanced at the clock on the wall – 8:15 pm. She had been expecting a call from Mrs. MacAllister about her beloved terrier, Winston, who was due for his post-surgery checkup. But the phone remained silent, its receiver cradled in its cradle like a forgotten promise.  

A shiver ran down Elara's spine. Something felt off. This wasn’t typical. 


Elara pushed aside the lingering unease and turned to attend to her overflowing paperwork. The clinic was always a whirlwind of activity, but tonight's stillness felt almost ominous. She hoped it was just a quiet night, nothing more. But as she stared out at the rain-soaked street, a flicker of doubt sparked in her mind, a whisper that something wasn't quite right.
