The humid August air hung heavy in Savannah, Georgia, thick with the scent of magnolia blossoms and simmering humidity. Eleanor Beatrice Beaumont, Esquire, pushed through the ornate iron gates of the historic courthouse, her crisp white linen suit already dampening against her skin. Sweat beaded on her brow, but she kept a stoic expression plastered across her face, her gaze fixed on the imposing Greek Revival façade before her. 

Savannah was a city steeped in history and secrets, where whispers of moss-draped tragedies echoed through its cobblestone streets. And Eleanor, a rising star in the legal world with a reputation for untangling even the most intricate webs of deceit, felt the weight of that history settle upon her shoulders like a shroud. Today, she was facing a case unlike any other: a murder trial shrouded in the city’s dark underbelly, where truth and justice were as elusive as a phantom waltz beneath the Spanish moss.
