The air in Amelia "Amy" Sinclair's office was thick with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows overlooking the Manhattan skyline, blurring the city into an impressionistic watercolor. The usually pristine mahogany desk was littered with crumpled papers and empty energy drink cans. A half-eaten bagel sat forlornly on a plate beside a cracked mug that still held a murky residue of once-hot coffee. 

Amy, CEO of Sinclair Innovations and youngest to hold the position in their sector, rubbed her temples, trying to quell the relentless throb behind her eyes. The pressure was immense; their latest project, a revolutionary AI assistant called "Athena," had been plagued by delays and bugs, jeopardizing not only the company's future but also Amy's carefully crafted reputation. 


The clock ticked past midnight, each click a hammer blow to Amy's already frayed nerves. She needed a solution, and fast.
