The scent of lilies choked the air in Flora Bellweather's shop, "Blooming Hearts." It wasn't an unpleasant smell, but after a decade of crafting floral arrangements, it could become as suffocating as a crowded subway car.  Flora ran a hand through her auburn curls, trying to ignore the cloying sweetness. Her bright yellow apron was stained with pollen and she had dirt under her fingernails, testament to her constant work amongst the blooming chaos.

Her shop was nestled on a quaint street in Greenwich Village, a world away from the concrete jungle of Manhattan that pressed against its edges. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating rows upon rows of vibrant blooms: sunflowers stood proud and bold, delicate orchids clung to their moss-covered poles, and roses blushed shyly in their vases. 

But today, even the flowers seemed subdued, mirroring Flora's mood. A wave of melancholy washed over her as she watched a young couple walk past, hand in hand, discussing wedding arrangements. It was always bittersweet - celebrating love while carrying the weight of her own unfulfilled longing.
