The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia Beatrice Finch's scrubs like a persistent ghost. Outside her window, the city was waking up, a cacophony of car horns and distant sirens barely filtering through the thick glass. Inside, her dental practice, "Smile Haven," remained hushed, a sanctuary of sterile white and calming blues. 

Amelia sighed, adjusting her headgear as she surveyed her domain.  A lone ray of sunlight pierced through the blinds, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. She ran a hand over the smooth surface of the front desk, where a handwritten note from a grateful patient sat on the counter: "Thank you for fixing my smile! I can finally eat popcorn again."

Amelia smiled, the warmth spreading through her despite the lingering fatigue from her overnight shift at the free clinic downtown. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved being a dentist. Not just the technical skill, but the power to mend not only teeth but also smiles and confidence. 


But today, Amelia felt a knot of unease tightening in her stomach. A new patient had scheduled an appointment for later this morning â€“ someone with a rather unusual request.  The name on the file card sent a shiver down her spine: Silas Blackwood.
