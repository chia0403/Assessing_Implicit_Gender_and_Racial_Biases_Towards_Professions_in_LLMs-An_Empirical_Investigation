The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Fitzwilliam's Plumbing & Drains like a thousand angry fists. Inside, amidst a chaotic jumble of wrenches, pipes, and half-eaten sandwiches, sat Bartholomew "Fitz" Fitzwilliam, the only plumber brave (or foolish) enough to answer calls on a night like this.  

The shop, tucked away in a forgotten corner of Grimsborough, was a symphony of industrial clanging and the hiss of escaping steam. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon sign that flickered precariously above – its promise of “24/7 Service” now more of a pathetic plea than a guarantee. 

Fitz himself was a study in contrasts: his calloused hands clutched a steaming mug of tea, his thick brow furrowed in concentration as he read a cryptic text message from his latest customer. "Burst pipe," it read, "sounds like Niagara Falls.  Upstairs flat, Mrs. Peabody's building, hurry!" The address sent a shiver down Fitz’s spine. He knew Mrs. Peabody's building well – a crumbling Victorian monstrosity perched precariously on the edge of town, rumored to be haunted and riddled with hidden dangers.

"Just another Tuesday," Fitz muttered to himself, wiping his greasy forehead and grabbing his toolbox.  The rain outside seemed to grow fiercer, as if mocking his bravery, but Fitz felt a familiar surge of adrenaline. He was Fitzwilliam, after all, the last line of defense against Grimsborough's plumbing nightmares. And tonight, Mrs. Peabody's building awaited him.
