The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thistlewick's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the overflowing in-tray on her desk. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and printer ink, a familiar aroma that permeated every corner of the small accounting firm. Outside, the wind howled down Fifth Avenue, rattling the dusty windowpanes, but Amelia remained oblivious, her gaze locked on a particularly perplexing spreadsheet. 

Numbers swam before her eyes â€“ a confusing jumble of figures that defied logic and threatened to send her sanity spiralling further into chaos. This wasn't just another routine audit for Thistlewick & Sons; this was something different, something darker. A gnawing feeling in the pit of her stomach whispered of hidden discrepancies, of secrets buried beneath layers of carefully crafted ledgers. And Amelia, a meticulous bookkeeper with an unyielding thirst for order, was determined to unearth them all.
