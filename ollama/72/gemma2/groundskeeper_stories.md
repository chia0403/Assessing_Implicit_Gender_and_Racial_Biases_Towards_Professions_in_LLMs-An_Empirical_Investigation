The sun beat down on Bartholomew Thistlewick’s back as he wrestled with the stubborn rose bush. Dewdrops clung stubbornly to the emerald fronds of ferns, making them shimmer in the pre-dawn light. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and honeysuckle, a fragrance that usually calmed Bartholomew, but today it did little to soothe his mounting frustration. 

Bartholomew, known affectionately as Bart by the few who ventured into the grounds of Blackwood Manor, was the sole caretaker of its sprawling gardens. He lived in a small cottage nestled between the ancient oak trees and the vegetable patch, a world away from the hushed grandeur of the manor itself. For decades, Bartholomew had tended to these lands with meticulous care, nurturing each bloom, pruning every branch, and whispering secrets to the rustling leaves. But lately, something felt different. A disquiet hung over the usually peaceful gardens, like a storm cloud threatening to burst. The once vibrant hues seemed muted, and even the buzzing of bees lacked their usual joyful melody.


Blackwood Manor, shrouded in whispers and local legends, loomed in the distance. Its stone façade was as imposing as it was beautiful, stained with time and etched with stories untold.  It stood silent now, its windows like vacant eyes staring out at Bartholomew's struggles. He couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was brewing within those walls, casting a shadow over his beloved gardens.
