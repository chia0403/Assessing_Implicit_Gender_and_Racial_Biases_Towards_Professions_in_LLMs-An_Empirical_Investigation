The aroma of caramelized sugar and warm yeast hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket against the chill creeping in through the gaps in Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's bakery windows. Outside, London was cloaked in the muted greys of November, rain slicking the cobblestones and sending shivers down the spines of passersby. But inside "Amelia's Ambrosia," warmth radiated from the crackling hearth, the bubbling ovens, and the soft glow of oil lamps hanging from the ceiling. 

Amelia herself was a flurry of activity, her flour-dusted apron flapping around her as she expertly kneaded dough for her signature sourdough bread. Her auburn hair, usually pulled back in a neat bun, escaped its confines, framing a face etched with years of laughter and long days spent perfecting her craft. A faint smile played on her lips as the rhythmic thudding of the dough echoed through the small bakery, a familiar lullaby that had soothed her soul since she was a child helping her grandmother in their own tiny kitchen.
