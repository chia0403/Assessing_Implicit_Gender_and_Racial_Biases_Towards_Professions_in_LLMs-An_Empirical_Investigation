The crisp air bit at Elias Thorneâ€™s cheeks, turning his breath to wisps that danced in the pre-dawn light. He pulled his woolen scarf tighter, wishing he'd worn gloves beneath his thick leather work ones. The Oregon rain, relentless as ever, drummed a steady rhythm on the canvas of his tarp shelter.  

Elias was alone, perched high above the valley floor on a mountainside carved from ancient Douglas firs. His world, for the past year, had been the towering pines and the echoing silence broken only by the rhythmic whine of his chainsaw. He'd come here seeking solitude after the city swallowed him whole, leaving behind nothing but hollow echoes of ambition and regret.

He wasn't sure how long he'd stay in this self-imposed exile, but for now, he was content to live by the rhythm of the forest, where the only company he kept were the whispering trees and the occasional raven circling overhead.  He gripped his chainsaw, its familiar weight a comfort in his calloused hand. Today, like every day, was a dance with the giants, a delicate balance between man and nature that he had to perform just right.
