The air in Amelia Grace Thornton's office hummed with the familiar whir of her vintage Smith Corona typewriter. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the Parisian skyline into an impressionistic watercolour. Outside, the Seine glistened under a bruised, twilight sky. Inside, however, Amelia’s world was bathed in the warm glow of her desk lamp, illuminating stacks of manuscripts and overflowing coffee cups. 

Amelia, with her unruly auburn curls escaping their bun and ink-stained fingers dancing across the keys, felt a surge of excitement. This manuscript – a gothic thriller by a debut author – held a unique darkness, a raw honesty that resonated deep within her. It was unlike anything she’d encountered before, a whispered secret waiting to be unleashed upon the world. 


As Amelia began sifting through the pages, a shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't just another story; it felt personal, almost prophetic.
