The rhythmic whirring of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Kensington's spinal decompression machine filled her small office in downtown Salem. Outside, the air hung heavy with the scent of autumn leaves and the promise of an early snowstorm. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already faded paint on the Victorian-era building. 

Amy glanced at the clock â€“ 4:58 pm. Just two minutes until closing time. Another day spent wrestling with aching backs, stiff necks, and the occasional misaligned pelvis. It wasn't glamorous, but it was honest work, helping people find relief from their physical burdens.  She hoped her next patient, Mr. Henderson, wouldn't be as grumpy as his last visit. The man seemed to have a permanent case of back pain and an even more permanent scowl.


As the chime on the door signaled its closing, Amy sighed and turned off the machine. Then, a sudden thump from the back office startled her.
