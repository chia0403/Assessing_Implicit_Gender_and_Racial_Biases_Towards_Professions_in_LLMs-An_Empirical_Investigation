The sun beat down on Jebediah "Jeb" Clayton's weathered face as he surveyed his land. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside him. The once vibrant green pastures of Clayton Ranch were now skeletal stalks of grass, withered and brittle under the relentless summer heat. Acrid smoke from a distant wildfire hung heavy in the air, casting an ominous orange glow over the horizon. 

Jeb knew this was more than just a bad season. This was a fight for survival, not just for his cattle, but for the legacy of Clayton Ranch, passed down through generations of his family. He ran a calloused hand across his forehead, feeling the grit of sweat and dust mingling together. It wouldn't be easy, but Jeb had weathered storms before. This one, however, felt different â€“ darker, more threatening.  


**Setting:**
Clayton Ranch, located in the dusty heart of the Arizona Territory during a severe drought and facing an encroaching wildfire.
