The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's head like a chorus of weary bees.  Her glasses perched precariously on her nose as she meticulously scrutinized a spreadsheet, each cell a tiny battlefield where numbers clashed and reconciled. The air in the office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation; the annual audit for Sterling & Sons Shipping Company was pushing everyone to their breaking points. Amelia herself felt a familiar prickle of anxiety crawling up her spine.  She wasn't known for being flamboyant, but even she could feel the pressure mounting. This year, the numbers were...off. 


Sterling & Sons, despite its charmingly old-fashioned name and seafaring heritage, was in trouble. The company had been losing money steadily for the past six months, and Amelia suspected something darker than simple mismanagement was at play. Her gut, which usually preferred to stick to analyzing profit margins rather than unraveling corporate conspiracies, was screaming at her that this audit was about to get very interesting. 

The setting: a cramped, cluttered accounting office in the bustling port city of Grimsborough, England. It's a place where nautical knots and ledger books collide, where the salty tang of the sea air mingles with the scent of old paper and stale coffee. The year is 1987, and the world outside is on the cusp of change, but here, within the four walls of this office, time seems to move at a slower pace, dictated by the relentless rhythm of the adding machine.
