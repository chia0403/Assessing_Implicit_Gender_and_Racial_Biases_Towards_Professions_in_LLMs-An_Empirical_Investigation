The iron clang of the gate echoed through the cobbled streets of Veridian Keep, bouncing off the towering white walls that encircled the city like a protective embrace. Elara Thorne, her crimson cloak flapping behind her like a startled bird, adjusted the weight of her halberd on her shoulder and squinted into the fading light. Dusk was settling over Veridian, casting long shadows that danced with the flickering lamplight spilling from the windows of bustling shops lining the main thoroughfare. 

Elara scanned the throngs of citizens going about their evening rituals – bakers hauling trays of warm bread, merchants hawking their wares, children chasing stray cats through the narrow alleys. But her eyes remained sharp, searching for anything out of place, anything that didn't belong in this tapestry of ordinary life. It was a duty she took seriously, one she'd been entrusted with since she was old enough to wield a dagger, trained by her father – the city’s Head Guard – to be vigilant, observant, and above all, unwavering.  Tonight, however, a prickle of unease ran down her spine. The air felt thick, almost charged, and the usual hum of Veridian seemed muffled, as if held beneath a blanket of unspoken tension.
