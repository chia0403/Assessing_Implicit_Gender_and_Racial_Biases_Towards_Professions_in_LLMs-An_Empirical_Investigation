The sun beat down on Silas “Hammer” Hawthorne’s neck like an angry blacksmith’s anvil. Sweat plastered his faded blue work shirt to his back, and each grunt as he wrestled another beam into place felt like a victory against the relentless heat of a July afternoon in Phoenix, Arizona. Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, swirling red gravel into miniature tornadoes that skirted the edges of the half-built apartment complex.  

Silas squinted at the foreman, a burly man named Big Bob with hands the size of ham hocks, who barked orders like a pack leader. “Hammer,” he bellowed, his voice lost in the clamor of hammers and saws, "Need those beams up on the east wing before lunchtime. Move it!"  


Silas gritted his teeth, wiping grime from his brow with the back of his calloused hand. Another day, another dollar. He wasn't complaining. A steady job was a blessing in this unforgiving desert city. But even the promise of his wife's homemade chili waiting at home couldn’t entirely mask the aching fatigue that settled deep in his bones.
