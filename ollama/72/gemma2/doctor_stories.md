Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, blurring the neon glow of the city outside into an impressionistic watercolor of reds and blues. Inside, Dr. Eleanor Grace Ashton, her brow creased with exhaustion, ran a gloved hand through her short, dark hair. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting harsh shadows across the faces of the patients in the crowded emergency room.

Her gaze lingered for a moment on the face of the man attached to it – young, barely out of his teens, with skin stretched tight over prominent cheekbones and eyes that held an unsettling stillness. Eleanor knew this battle was far from over. 


St. Jude's, nestled in the heart of Detroit's crumbling industrial district, wasn’t just a hospital; it was a fortress against the city's relentless tide of poverty and violence.  Here, amidst the constant hum of machines and the hushed whispers of worried families, Eleanor fought her own battles – not with scalpels and sutures, but with empathy and unwavering determination.
