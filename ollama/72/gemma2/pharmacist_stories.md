The pungent scent of menthol lingered in the air, a familiar perfume to Beatrice Amelia Hawthorne as she swept through the aisles of Hawthorne’s Apothecary. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating shelves crammed with jars of dried herbs, bottles filled with brightly colored tinctures, and stacks of leather-bound tomes on herbal remedies. A bell tinkled above the door as a young boy, no older than ten, scurried inside, his face creased with worry. 

Beatrice, her silver braid bouncing with each step, greeted him with a gentle smile. "Well hello there, Thomas. What brings you to Hawthorne's Apothecary today?" The boy hesitated, tugging at the hem of his tunic. Beatrice knelt down, meeting his gaze.  "Don't be shy, dear one. Tell me what troubles you."

Thomas swallowed hard. "My mother... she's got a terrible cough. Nothing seems to help. I thought maybe..." he glanced nervously at the shelves overflowing with remedies, "...maybe you could help?"


Beatrice’s smile widened. This was her haven – not just a shop, but a sanctuary for those seeking solace from ailments both physical and emotional. "Of course, Thomas," she said softly. "Let's see what we can do."
