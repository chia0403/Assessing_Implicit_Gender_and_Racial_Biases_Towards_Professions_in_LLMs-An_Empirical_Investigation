The pungent aroma of iron and spices hung heavy in the air, a symphony for Elias Blackwood's nostrils. He stood behind his counter, its worn wood polished smooth by years of calloused hands, meticulously trimming fat from a slab of pork belly. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of "Blackwood’s Butchery," casting long shadows across the tiled floor. The shop was cramped, filled with hooks laden with cuts of meat ranging from glistening sausages to slabs of prime rib, all bathed in a golden glow. Elias ran his thumb over the curve of a cleaver, its edge gleaming like a sliver of moonlight. He knew every inch of this place, every creak of the floorboards and every sigh of the old refrigerator humming at the back. 

This was his haven, his sanctuary – a world away from the cobbled streets of London, where shadows lurked and whispers travelled faster than rats. Here, amidst the familiar smells and sounds, Elias Blackwood could be himself: a butcher, a craftsman, a man who found solace in the quiet rhythm of cleaver against bone.
