The air hung thick with humidity, the kind that clung to you like a second skin even under the shade of the ancient oak where Elias Thorne took his break. Sweat beaded on his brow, tracing familiar paths through the dust caked on his cheeks. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a greasy streak across his already sun-kissed face. 

Elias had been landscaping estates in this sweltering corner of Georgia for as long as he could remember. His family had built their livelihood on the manicured lawns and vibrant flower beds that graced the sprawling mansions lining Savannah's outskirts.  He knew every inch of these gardens, from the delicate veins of the azalea blossoms to the stubborn roots of the ancient pecan trees. But lately, even the familiar comfort of his work felt stifling. A restlessness had begun to gnaw at him, a yearning for something more than meticulously trimmed hedges and perfectly spaced rose bushes.  

He took another swig of lukewarm water from his canteen, its plastic rattling against his hip. The silence was broken only by the hum of cicadas and the distant rumble of thunder, promising relief from the relentless heat. But Elias didn't think rain would be enough to wash away the growing discontent that threatened to drown him.
