The scent of linseed oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of turpentine and a faint whiff of jasmine from the potted plant perched precariously on Amelia Rose Hawthorneâ€™s cluttered easel. Sunlight streamed through the dusty attic window, casting long shadows across the floor strewn with paint tubes, brushes, and half-finished canvases.  Amelia, her brow furrowed in concentration, dabbed at a canvas depicting a swirling vortex of crimson and gold, trying to capture the ethereal glow she'd seen in an old photograph of Venice at sunset. A symphony of chirping birds sang outside, their melody battling with the rhythmic thrumming of traffic from the bustling city below. 

Amelia lived in a ramshackle Victorian house perched on a hill overlooking Edinburgh. The attic, her sanctuary, was a world away from the noise and chaos of the city streets. It was here, surrounded by her canvases and paints, that she found solace and expression, where reality faded and imagination took flight.
