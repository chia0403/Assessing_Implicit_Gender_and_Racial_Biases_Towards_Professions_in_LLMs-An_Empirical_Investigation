The air in Jasper's workshop hung thick with the scent of sawdust and whetstone. A fine layer of dust coated everything â€“ the worn wooden workbench, the half-finished marble sculpture, even the wisps of grey hair clinging to Jasper Caldwell's forehead. The only source of light was a single shaft piercing through the grime-coated windowpane, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness.  

Jasper sat hunched over his work, chiseling away at a block of jade. His calloused fingers moved with practiced ease, guided by a vision born not of sketches or blueprints, but from the stone itself. It whispered secrets to him, stories etched in its green depths, begging to be released. 

Outside, the bustling city of Veridian sprawled beneath a sky bruised purple and orange by the setting sun. But here, in his sanctuary tucked away in a forgotten alleyway, Jasper was untouched by the clamour and chaos. He existed only in the quiet companionship of stone, his chisel a weapon against the mundane, carving beauty from the unyielding earth.
