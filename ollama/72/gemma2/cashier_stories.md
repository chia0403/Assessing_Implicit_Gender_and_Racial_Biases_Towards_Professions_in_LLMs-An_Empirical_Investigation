The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Peterson's head like angry wasps, their buzzing mirroring the impatience gnawing at her insides. The afternoon rush was in full swing at the Discount Den, and her register, usually a placid pool of transactions, had become a churning whirlpool of coupons, crumpled bills, and demanding customers. 

Amelia tried to maintain a neutral expression as she scanned yet another pack of discount ramen noodles, but her shoulders ached with the monotony of it all. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and artificial perfume, punctuated by the occasional burst of static from the malfunctioning music system playing elevator muzak at an inappropriate volume.  


 Outside, the Florida sun beat down on the cracked asphalt parking lot, baking the red pickup trucks and dented sedans until they shimmered like mirages. It was a day that mirrored Amelia's mood â€“ hot, sticky, and drainingly predictable.
