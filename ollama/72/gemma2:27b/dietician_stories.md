Rain lashed against the windowpane of Beatrice Ainsworth's tiny office, blurring the already bleak cityscape outside.  The air inside was thick with the scent of chamomile tea and desperation. Beatrice sipped from her mug, trying to calm the churning in her stomach. Today was supposed to be a new beginning - her own private practice, finally free from the soul-crushing bureaucracy of the hospital. But so far, all she'd seen were empty chairs and dwindling bank statements.

She glanced at the clock. 3:45 pm. Her only appointment for the day, Mrs. Petrovich, was due in fifteen minutes. Beatrice sighed. She hoped this wouldn't be another case of someone looking for a miracle cure instead of facing their own unhealthy habits.  Still, she couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for the woman â€“ Beatrice knew firsthand how easy it was to fall into destructive patterns when life threw you curveballs.
