Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Beatrice "Bee" Clementine's office, each drop like a tiny hammer blow against the glass.  It was April 14th, and Bee's cramped cubicle on the third floor of the old Thompson Building felt like a pressure cooker. Stacks of W-2s, 1099s, and receipts teetered precariously on every surface, threatening to spill over into an avalanche of financial chaos.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation â€“ a potent cocktail that Bee had come to associate with tax season.

Bee, a woman whose wiry frame and sharp wit belied her unassuming appearance, was wrestling with a particularly thorny case.  Mr. Bartholomew Tibbs III, a self-proclaimed "entrepreneur" who seemed to operate in a world of dubious cryptocurrency investments and offshore accounts, had brought in a shoebox stuffed with receipts scrawled on cocktail napkins and grocery lists. Deciphering his financial labyrinth was proving to be an Olympian task.

Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Bee's soul. This tax season felt different.  There was a gnawing sense of unease, a premonition that something was about to shift, upending her carefully ordered world.
