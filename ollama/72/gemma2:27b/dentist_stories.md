The faint scent of clove oil hung in the air, battling with the sterile tang of disinfectant.  Dr. Elias Thorne, his brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously adjusted the angle of the dental mirror. The patient, a nervous young woman named Clara, flinched as the cold metal touched her tooth.

"Just hold still for a moment," Dr. Thorne soothed, his voice calm and reassuring despite the tremor running through his own hand. Outside his small office window in the historic district of Savannah, Georgia, the Spanish moss draped from ancient oak trees swayed gently in the humid breeze. The sounds of horse-drawn carriages and distant jazz music drifted in, a stark contrast to the quiet tension within the cramped space.

Dr. Thorne had been practicing dentistry for over twenty years, but Clara's case was proving particularly challenging. Her fear, palpable in the room, seemed to amplify the complexity of the procedure. He needed to fix her chipped molar quickly, efficiently, and most importantly, without scaring her further.
