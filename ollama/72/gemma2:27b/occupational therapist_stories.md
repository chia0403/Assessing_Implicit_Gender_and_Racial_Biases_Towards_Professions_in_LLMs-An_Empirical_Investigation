Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor Ainsworth. A tangle of worry gnawed at her as she surveyed the cluttered therapy room: stacks of brightly colored balance balls threatened to topple, resistance bands lay strewn across the floor like discarded snakes, and a half-finished jigsaw puzzle mocked her from a corner table.

Eleanor was no stranger to chaos – it came with the territory of being an occupational therapist at St. Jude's, a facility specializing in helping patients regain lost abilities after traumatic injuries. But today felt different. Today, she was facing her most challenging patient yet: Arthur Blackwood, a renowned architect who had suffered a devastating stroke that left him struggling to perform even the simplest tasks.

Arthur’s sharp intellect and frustrated determination were palpable, making Eleanor both eager to help and acutely aware of the immense pressure she faced. Could she, with all her knowledge and experience, guide this brilliant man back from the precipice of despair? The answer, like the storm raging outside, felt uncertain and far away.
