The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and bleach, a peculiar but comforting perfume unique to Salon Seraphina.  Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its golden rays. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, her fiery red hair piled atop her head in a messy bun, expertly wielded a pair of shears, carving layers into a client's thick, auburn mane. Outside, the bustling streets of New Orleans pulsed with life – jazz melodies spilled from open doorways, the scent of beignets wafted on the humid breeze, and the rhythmic clip-clop of horse-drawn carriages echoed on cobblestone streets. 

But inside Salon Seraphina, it was a haven of calm amidst the chaos. Ellie loved this space, her sanctuary where she transformed not just hair but also lives. Today, however, felt different. A prickling unease settled in Ellie's stomach, a discordant note against the usual symphony of snipping scissors and cheerful chatter. It started with a cryptic voicemail from her grandmother, hinting at a secret buried deep within their family history. Now, as she meticulously styled Mrs. Dubois’ hair for her granddaughter's wedding, Ellie couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous – and perhaps dangerous – was about to unfold.
