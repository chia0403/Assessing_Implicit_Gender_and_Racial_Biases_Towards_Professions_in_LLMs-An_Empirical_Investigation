The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the smell of pine needles and freshly cut grass. Cicadas buzzed their relentless summer song from the towering oak trees that lined the edge of the field. Beatrice "Bea" Holloway stood on the fifty-yard line, clipboard clutched in her hand, a scowl etching lines into her tanned face. Sweat beaded on her forehead despite the late afternoon sun already starting its descent.

This wasn't how Bea envisioned her coaching career starting. She dreamt of leading a powerhouse team to state championships, not wrangling a ragtag group of twelve-year-olds who seemed more interested in chasing butterflies than perfecting their tackling technique. 


The Bulldogs, as they were affectionately (though perhaps ironically) called, were the laughing stock of the youth league. Their record was a dismal 0-5, and morale was lower than Bea's chances of winning Coach of the Year. Todayâ€™s practice felt like a battle against apathy rather than athletic improvement.
