Rain lashed against the attic windowpanes, each drop a frantic drumbeat against the silence of Eleanor Finch's writing room. Dust motes danced in the pale shaft of sunlight that pierced through a crack in the boarded-up window, illuminating her cluttered desk - a chaotic battlefield of ink-stained manuscripts, half-empty coffee cups, and overflowing ashtrays.

Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempestuous emotions churning within her. Perhaps, Eleanor thought glumly, she needed inspiration from beyond the confines of her dusty attic refuge.
