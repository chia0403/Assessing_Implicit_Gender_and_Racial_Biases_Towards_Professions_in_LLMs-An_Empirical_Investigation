The air hung thick with humidity, a palpable weight pressing down on Eleanor "Ellie" Vance as she wrestled with a tangled mess of wires beneath an ancient radio console. The flickering neon sign of the Starlight Diner cast an ethereal green glow across the dusty workshop, illuminating Ellie's grease-stained fingers and the cobwebs clinging to the rafters above. 

Outside, the relentless drone of cicadas punctuated the silence of the deserted highway that snaked past her father's roadside diner. Ellie sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from her brow. This wasn't exactly what she had envisioned for herself after graduating top of her class in radio engineering. But ever since her father fell ill, she found herself trading intricate circuit designs for patching up the Starlight Diner's antiquated jukebox and troubleshooting the intermittent hum emanating from the neon sign.

Tonight, though, Ellie was grappling with a challenge far more intriguing: restoring an ancient, military-grade radio receiver salvaged from a World War II bomber wreck discovered in the nearby woods. The rusted metal casing held secrets whispered in forgotten frequencies, tantalizing Ellie with promises of hidden messages and lost histories.
