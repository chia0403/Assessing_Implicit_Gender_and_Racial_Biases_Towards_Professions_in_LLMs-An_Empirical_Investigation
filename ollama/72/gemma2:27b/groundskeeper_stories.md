The air hung thick with the sweet rot of fallen leaves and damp earth. A fine mist clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's beard as he surveyed the sprawling expanse of Whispering Pines Cemetery. The ancient oaks groaned under the weight of autumn, their skeletal branches casting long, twisted shadows across moss-covered headstones. 

Bart, with his weathered hands calloused from years of tending to this hallowed ground, felt a peculiar sense of peace amidst the stillness. He knew every twist and turn of the winding paths, recognized the names etched on each monument like old friends. The cemetery wasn't just a job for Bart; it was a sanctuary, a place where time seemed to whisper rather than shout.  

Today, however, a disquiet lingered in the air. A chill breeze rustled through the leaves, carrying with it an unsettling hum that Bart couldn't quite place. As he made his way towards the mausoleum at the crest of the hill, he noticed something unusual â€“ a single, perfect rose lying on the ground beside the granite crypt of the Blackwood family. The Blackwoods had been buried there for generations, their lineage stretching back to the founding of the town. A fresh flower amidst the decay seemed wildly out of place.
