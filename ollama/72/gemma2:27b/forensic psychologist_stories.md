The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across Dr. Evelyn Thorne's cluttered desk, highlighting stacks of case files teetering precariously amongst mugs stained with cold coffee and half-eaten granola bars. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of her cramped office at the San Francisco Police Department, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic smear of grey and yellow. The incessant drumming echoed Evelyn's own restless heart. 

A new case file lay open before her, its stark black and white photos depicting a gruesome scene: a young woman, barely out of her teens, slumped against a graffiti-covered brick wall, her lifeless eyes staring vacantly into the unforgiving night. "Jane Doe," the file read in bold, impersonal font. Another faceless victim demanding Evelyn's insight, her ability to delve into the darkest recesses of the human psyche and piece together the shattered puzzle of their final moments.

The phone on her desk buzzed, jarring her from her contemplation. It was Detective Ramirez, his gruff voice laced with urgency. "Doc," he rasped, "we need you down at the scene ASAP. This one's a real head-scratcher." Evelyn sighed, pushing back her chair and bracing herself for another descent into the abyss.
