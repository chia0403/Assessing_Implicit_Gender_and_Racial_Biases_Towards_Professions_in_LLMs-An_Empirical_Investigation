Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, mimicking the frantic beat of Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright's heart. The bell above the pharmacy door jingled, announcing a customer braving the deluge. Eleanor plastered on her best professional smile, willing herself to calm down.

The wind howled like a banshee, whipping waves against the cliffs that guarded their little harbour.  Inside Cartwright's Pharmacy, the air hung thick with the scent of lavender hand cream and dusty old remedies. 

Eleanor gripped the worn counter, her fingers tracing the faint etchings left by generations of pharmacists before her. This pharmacy was more than just a business; it was woven into the fabric of Oakhaven, a sanctuary for the sick and weary. But tonight, it felt like a prison.
