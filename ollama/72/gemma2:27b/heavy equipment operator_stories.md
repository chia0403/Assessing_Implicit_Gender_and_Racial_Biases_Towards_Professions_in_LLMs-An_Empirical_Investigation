The Nevada sun beat down on Silas "Mac" McAlister's neck, turning his already weathered skin a shade darker. He squinted through the dust swirling around him, watching the behemoth Caterpillar D11 bulldozer inch forward, its massive tracks churning up the parched earth. Mac gripped the controls with calloused hands, his brow furrowed in concentration.

He was carving out a new access road for the mine, a labyrinthine network of tunnels and shafts burrowed deep into the heart of the Nevada desert. The air hummed with the droning whine of the engine and the rhythmic clang of the dozer blade against rock. It was a symphony of industry Mac knew by heart, a soundtrack to his solitary existence in this unforgiving landscape.

The silence, broken only by the machine's growl, was both comforting and unsettling. He missed the banter of the crew he used to work with back east, the camaraderie born from shared hardship and sweat. But here, in the desolate beauty of Nevada, Mac found solace in the solitude, his thoughts as vast and endless as the desert sky above him. 

Today, though, something felt different. A prickling unease crawled up his spine. It wasn't the familiar heat or the ever-present dust. No, this was a deeper disquiet, a sense that he was being watched. He glanced around, but saw nothing but the relentless sun and the skeletal remains of Joshua trees dotting the horizon. Still, the feeling persisted.
