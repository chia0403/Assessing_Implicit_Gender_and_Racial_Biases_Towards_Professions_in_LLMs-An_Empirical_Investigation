Rain lashed against the windows of Elias Blackwood's cramped office cubicle, mimicking the storm brewing inside him. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar cocktail in the cutthroat world of tech sales. Elias adjusted his tie, the cheap polyester scratching at his neck, and stared at the reflection in his computer monitor. His tired eyes, framed by dark circles, looked back at him, mirroring the exhaustion that had become a constant companion.

His phone buzzed – another missed call from his manager, Mr. Davenport, no doubt wanting an update on his abysmal sales figures for the month. Elias couldn't blame him. After all, selling the latest line of "revolutionary" smart toasters seemed like a Herculean task when half the market hadn't figured out how to work their regular toaster ovens yet.  

Elias sighed. He needed a win, something – anything – to turn this tide before Davenport decided he was more trouble than he was worth.
