The wind clawed at Elara Thorne's cloak, biting through the thick wool as if it were spun from cobwebs.  Above her, the sky was bruised purple and orange, the remnants of a dying sunset struggling against the encroaching night. The obsidian walls of Castle Obsidian loomed behind her, stark and imposing against the fading light. Elara shifted her weight, the heavy longsword at her hip digging into her thigh. A shiver ran down her spine, not entirely from the cold.

Something felt off tonight.  The usual quiet hum of activity in the castle courtyard was replaced by an unnerving stillness. Even the crows, who usually squawked and jostled for scraps near the kitchens, were absent. Elara strained her ears, listening for any sign of trouble.

She'd been guarding the south gate for three years now, ever since she'd joined the King's Guard. Three years of endless patrols, monotonous drills, and the occasional drunken brawl in the tavern. It wasn't exactly the glorious life she'd envisioned when she'd left her small village, sword strapped to her back and fire in her eyes.

But tonight was different. Tonight, a prickle of unease crawled beneath her skin, whispering warnings that Elara couldn't ignore.
