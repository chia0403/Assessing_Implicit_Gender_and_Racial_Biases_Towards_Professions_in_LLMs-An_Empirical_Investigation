Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him.  The air hung thick with cigar smoke and disappointment, the scent blending unpleasantly with the faint aroma of stale coffee that clung to his worn desk chair. Outside, the neon sign of Benny's Bar flickered erratically, casting a sickly green hue across the rain-slicked street below. Teddy, a man whose face bore the map of a life lived in shadows and half-truths, stared glumly at the stack of rejected claims on his desk.  Another month, another pile of misery he couldn't alleviate. His job, selling hope disguised as insurance policies, felt increasingly like peddling lies to the desperate. 

Tonight, however, a different kind of desperation gnawed at him. It wasn't the familiar ache of seeing families lose everything, but something personal, something that threatened to unravel the precarious threads holding his own life together. A knock on the door broke through his reverie, and Teddy straightened, pushing the despair back into the recesses of his mind. He had a client to see, another story of hardship to hear, another chance, however slim, to make things right.  

"Come in," he rasped, his voice betraying the weariness etched onto his face.
