Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the precinct house, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street.  A low rumble of thunder punctuated the incessant drumming, making Detective Eloise "Ellie" Ramirez wince. She rubbed at her tired eyes, the harsh fluorescent lights doing little to alleviate the throbbing behind them. Three days straight on this case and it was starting to feel like a bad dream she couldn't wake up from.

The victim, a young woman named Maya Patel, had been found strangled in her own apartment. There were no signs of forced entry, no obvious motive. Just a chilling scene: Maya sprawled on the floor, her eyes wide and vacant, a single crimson rose clutched in her lifeless hand. Ellie stared at the photograph pinned to the corkboard above her desk â€“ Maya's bright smile seemed impossibly incongruous with the grim reality. 

Ellie sighed, pushing away from her desk and pacing across the worn linoleum floor. The case was like a tangled knot, with every lead unraveling into another dead end. She needed something, anything, to break through the suffocating stillness. The rhythmic tick of the clock on the wall echoed her mounting frustration. This city never slept, but tonight it felt as if even the shadows were holding their breath.
