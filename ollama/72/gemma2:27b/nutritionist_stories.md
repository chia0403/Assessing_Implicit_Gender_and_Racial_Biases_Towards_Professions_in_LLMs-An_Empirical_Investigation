Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her.  Her meticulously organized desk, usually a haven of colorful charts and calorie-counted meal plans, was now strewn with crumpled napkins and empty coffee cups. Across from her sat Mrs. Peabody, her plump face contorted in a grimace that suggested Amelia had just uttered a mortal insult.

"Kale chips?" Mrs. Peabody scoffed, pushing away the proffered bowl as if it contained poison. "Amelia, darling, I'm not some rabbit! I need real food, something with flavor, something..." she trailed off, her eyes scanning the room hungrily. 

The aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg wafted in from the bakery downstairs, a cruel reminder of Amelia's own dietary restrictions. She sighed, running a hand through her fiery red curls.  Her office, nestled in a charming but slightly rundown building on Elm Street, was supposed to be a sanctuary for healthy eating, a place where people could learn to love their bodies and nourish them with goodness.

But today, facing Mrs. Peabody's stubborn resistance and the insistent rumble of her own stomach, Amelia felt like she was failing miserably.
