Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the storm raging inside Eliza Beatrice Hawthorne. Her knuckles were bone-white as she gripped the railing outside Room 204. Beyond the door lay Mrs. O’Connell, her heart fluttering like a frantic sparrow trapped in its cage.

Eliza had known this day was coming, knew that Mrs. O'Connell’s frail body couldn’t hold on forever. But knowing and experiencing were two vastly different things. The pungent scent of disinfectant did little to mask the metallic tang of fear clinging to the air. Eliza closed her eyes, drawing a shaky breath. Her heart ached for the woman whose hand she had held countless times, who confided her worries and dreams with a trust that Eliza cherished.

Taking one last steadying breath, Eliza pushed open the door, steeling herself for what lay beyond.
