The air in "Nails by Nat" hung heavy with the sweet scent of acrylics and acetone, punctuated by the rhythmic rasping of emery boards. Natalia Ramirez, her fingers stained the faintest shade of rose pink from years of handling polish, expertly sculpted a client's nails into elegant almond shapes. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating swirling dust motes and casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the clatter of the El Train vibrated through the storefront, a constant reminder of Natalia's own restless energy, forever buzzing beneath her calm exterior.

But today, that energy was tinged with anxiety. Mrs. Goldstein, her regular Friday appointment, had yet to arrive. Natalia glanced at the clock - twenty minutes past their usual time. Something wasn't right.
