The air hung heavy with the scent of frying garlic and desperation. It was another Friday night at Luigi's, and Amelia "Amy" Esposito was already feeling the familiar prickle of anxiety behind her eyes. The red-checkered tablecloth felt like sandpaper against her palm as she straightened a wonky fork, the clatter echoing through the near-empty restaurant. 

Luigi's wasn't exactly glamorous. Tucked away on a side street in Little Italy, its faded brick facade and peeling neon sign hardly screamed "fine dining." But for Amy, it was a lifeline â€“ the only job she could find after dropping out of culinary school. It paid the bills (barely) and kept her close to her Nonna, who lived two blocks away and still believed Amy would one day own her own trattoria.  

Tonight, however, the usual Friday night rush felt miles away. Only three tables were occupied: a grumpy couple arguing over breadsticks, a lone businessman glued to his phone, and a group of college students giggling over pitchers of sangria. 


Amy sighed, wishing she could disappear into the steam rising from the pasta pot in the kitchen. Maybe tonight would be slow enough for her to sneak in some studying for her GED. A dream she'd been putting off, just like everything else.

But then the bell above the door chimed, and a figure stepped inside, interrupting Amy's thoughts and plunging Luigi's into a sudden hush. The newcomer was tall and strikingly handsome, with dark hair that curled slightly at his temples and eyes that seemed to hold a thousand untold stories. He wore a worn leather jacket over a simple black t-shirt, an air of mystery surrounding him like the faint scent of sandalwood that clung to his clothes.  

Amy felt her heart skip a beat. Maybe tonight wouldn't be so bad after all.
