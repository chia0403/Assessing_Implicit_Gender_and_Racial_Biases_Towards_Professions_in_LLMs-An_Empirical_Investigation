The rasp of flint against granite echoed through the cavernous workshop, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of Silas Tiberius Thorne's hammer. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the dusty skylights overhead, illuminating the raw beauty of the stone he worked.

Silas, a man carved from granite himself with calloused hands and shoulders as broad as the slabs he shaped, squinted at his work. He was carving a gargoyle for the new cathedral spire, its menacing visage slowly emerging from the rough block. Sweat beaded on his brow, reflecting the flickering flames of the forge in the corner. The heat mingled with the scent of stone dust and beeswax, creating an aroma unique to his craft.

His workshop, nestled deep within the heart of Oldtown, was a sanctuary from the bustling city beyond. Stone walls, heavy with the weight of centuries, enclosed a world of chisels, mallets, and half-finished sculptures. Outside, merchants hawked their wares and children chased pigeons in the cobblestone streets, but inside, it was just Silas and his stone, engaged in a silent conversation only they understood.
