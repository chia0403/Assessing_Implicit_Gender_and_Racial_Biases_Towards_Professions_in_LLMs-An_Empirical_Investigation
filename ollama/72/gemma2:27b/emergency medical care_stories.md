The siren wailed like a banshee caught in a hurricane, its mournful cry slicing through the humid New Orleans night. Sweat slicked Eleanor "Ellie" Moreau's palms as she gripped the steering wheel, her trusty ambulance, 'Ol Bess,' groaning beneath her as they weaved through the labyrinthine streets of the French Quarter.

The call had come in barely five minutes ago: a multiple car collision on Bourbon Street, casualties unknown. Ellie's pulse quickened. This was her element â€“ the chaos, the adrenaline, the desperate fight for life. She thrived in it, finding a strange calm amidst the storm. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced down her spine, a premonition she couldn't shake off. 


Bourbon Street shimmered under the sickly glow of neon signs, the usual raucous revelry replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated by distant screams and the wail of approaching sirens. Ellie slammed 'Ol Bess into park, the brakes squealing in protest, and leapt out into the pandemonium.
