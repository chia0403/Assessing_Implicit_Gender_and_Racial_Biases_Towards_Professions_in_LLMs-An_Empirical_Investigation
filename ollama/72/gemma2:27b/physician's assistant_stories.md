Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Urgent Care clinic, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an impressionistic smear of red and green. Inside, Amelia Cartwright tapped her pen impatiently against the intake form, the rhythmic clicking echoing in the near-empty waiting room. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the linoleum floor, amplifying the sense of desolation that had settled over her since she'd started her shift four hours ago.

Amelia wasn't exactly sure what she expected from a Wednesday night in rural Pine Ridge, Montana. But this...this gnawing emptiness was new. It felt like the quiet itself was pressing down on her, suffocating any spark of enthusiasm she usually had for helping people. 


Perhaps it was the dreary weather. Perhaps it was the lingering memory of Dr. Evans's curt dismissal earlier that day â€“ "Amelia, you need to learn to prioritize," he'd barked, his face tight with disapproval. Or maybe, just maybe, it was the unsettling dream she'd had the night before, a vivid nightmare filled with shadowy figures and whispered warnings.
