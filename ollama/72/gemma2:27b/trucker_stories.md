The sun beat down on Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's rig like a blacksmith's hammer. Dust devils danced in the distance, twisting and contorting against the shimmering backdrop of Nevada desert. The air inside the cab was thick with the scent of diesel and stale coffee, punctuated by the rhythmic hum of the engine. 

Esme gripped the steering wheel, her calloused hands navigating the endless ribbon of highway. Her weathered face, framed by a tangle of ebony curls escaping from her bandana, reflected years spent battling harsh landscapes and lonely nights. She squinted at the horizon, searching for any sign of life beyond the shimmering heat haze.  A lone hawk circled overhead, its piercing cry echoing the desolation that stretched before her.

Today's haul was a beast - a triple-axle flatbed stacked high with construction beams destined for a booming metropolis hundreds of miles away. Every mile she drove felt like a battle against the elements and the monotony of the road. Yet, Esme wouldn't have it any other way. The open highway was her sanctuary, a place where she could find solace in the rhythmic rumble of her engine and the vastness of the world around her.  

But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of her neck, an unsettling silence that seemed to amplify the hum of her tires. As she crested a desolate hill, Esme saw it â€“ a plume of smoke rising in the distance, twisting against the azure sky like a serpent's tongue.
