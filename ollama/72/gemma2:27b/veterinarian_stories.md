The air inside was thick with the smell of disinfectant and something vaguely metallic â€“ perhaps fear. Dr. Amelia Kensington sighed, rubbing her temples. It had been a long night already, filled with panicked owners and distressed animals. She hadn't even had time for a proper cup of tea. Now, as the storm raged outside, she braced herself for whatever walked through the door next.

Its quaint charm was somewhat lost on Amelia tonight, who longed for the warm glow of her fireplace and a good book. But duty called. She straightened her stethoscope, listening for the telltale squeak of the door as another weary soul sought her help.

This wasn't just any veterinary clinic. Nestled amongst jars of preserved specimens and antique medical instruments was a secret Amelia kept close: a connection to the animals, a whisper in her mind that allowed her to understand their unspoken needs. A gift, some might call it. A burden, she often felt.
