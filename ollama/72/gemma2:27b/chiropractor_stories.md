Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's practice, blurring the view of the quaint cobblestone street below.  The cozy waiting room smelled faintly of lavender and eucalyptus from the diffuser she kept humming in the corner. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, but inside, everything was calm. A fire crackled merrily in the stone fireplace, casting dancing shadows on the worn leather armchairs. Evelyn, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, sat at her desk reviewing patient files. 

She tapped her pen thoughtfully against a file labeled "Mr. Alistair Finch," his appointment looming in ten minutes. Mr. Finch was a new patient, complaining of persistent lower back pain and what he described as "a crick" in his neck that wouldn't budge. Evelyn sighed â€“ she had a feeling this one might be tricky.
