The rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Alistair Finch's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his skull.  His cramped space on the third floor above Mrs. O'Malley's bakery smelled perpetually of sugar and stale cigarettes, a fitting aroma for a man whose life was as messy as his desk. Empty coffee mugs littered the surface amongst piles of case files, each one whispering promises of forgotten dreams and unpaid bills. Alistair, a man weathered by years spent chasing shadows in the labyrinthine alleyways of Newhaven City, rubbed his bloodshot eyes and reached for another lukewarm cup from the overflowing pot. The neon glow from the "Finch Investigations" sign outside cast long, distorted shadows across the room, painting a grim portrait of his current predicament.

A knock on the door, sharp and insistent, startled him. He straightened his rumpled trench coat and mumbled, "Come in," bracing himself for whatever fresh hell awaited him.
