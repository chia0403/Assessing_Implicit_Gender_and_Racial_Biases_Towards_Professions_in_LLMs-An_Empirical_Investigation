The brass bell clanged against its mahogany stand with a dull thud that resonated through Theodore "Teddy" Alistair Finch's bones. It was always like this in the late afternoon at The Grand Blackwood - a symphony of clattering dishes from the kitchens below, the rhythmic thump of luggage being dragged across marble floors, and the insistent chime announcing yet another weary traveler arriving at their haven for the night. 

Teddy straightened his already impeccably pressed uniform – midnight blue with gleaming gold buttons – and forced a smile onto his face as Mrs. Cartwright, a woman whose purse seemed perpetually overflowing with Pomeranians and diamonds, approached the revolving door.  He knew her type: demanding, entitled, but ultimately generous with tips if treated well enough. Teddy was determined to make her stay at The Grand Blackwood as memorable as possible – after all, it wasn't every day you got to serve a guest rumored to have once dined with royalty. 


The opulent lobby of The Grand Blackwood shimmered under the soft glow of chandeliers that hung like glittering icicles from the vaulted ceiling.  Marble pillars, adorned with intricate carvings of mythical creatures, rose towards the ornate fresco depicting a celestial ballroom above. Teddy navigated this labyrinthine space with practiced ease, his polished shoes barely making a sound on the plush Persian rugs. The air was thick with the scent of lilies and expensive perfume, a heady mix that always left him feeling slightly dizzy.

He waited patiently for Mrs. Cartwright's entourage to disembark from their limousine, ready to whisk her luggage away to her penthouse suite overlooking the city. But as Teddy approached the car, a flicker of movement in the shadows across the street caught his eye. It was something fleeting, almost imperceptible – a figure disappearing into a darkened alleyway. Curiosity tugged at him, momentarily eclipsing the well-rehearsed smile he offered Mrs. Cartwright.
