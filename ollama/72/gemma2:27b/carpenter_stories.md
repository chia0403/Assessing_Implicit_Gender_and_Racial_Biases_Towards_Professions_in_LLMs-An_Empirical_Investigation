Sawdust danced in the afternoon sunbeams slanting through the open doorway of Alistair Finch's workshop. The air hung heavy with the scent of cedar and beeswax, punctuated by the rhythmic rasp of Alistair's plane against oak. He worked with focused intensity, his weathered hands moving with practiced grace as he sculpted a delicate curve into the edge of a rocking chair. 

The workshop itself was a testament to Alistair's craft: every beam, every plank, every tool meticulously placed and cared for. Sunlight illuminated the gleaming surfaces of finished furniture - a sturdy farmhouse table, a graceful writing desk, a child's toy chest painted with whimsical flowers. Outside, the bustling market square of Oakhaven hummed with life, but within these wooden walls, Alistair found solace in the quiet rhythm of creation.
