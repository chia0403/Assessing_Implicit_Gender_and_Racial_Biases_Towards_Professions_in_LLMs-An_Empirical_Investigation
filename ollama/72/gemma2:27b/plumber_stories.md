The greasy wrench slipped in Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's calloused hand, sending a shower of sparks flying from the ancient boiler he was wrestling with. The air hung thick with the smell of rust and burnt copper, punctuated by Bart's exasperated grunt. Outside, the relentless New York City summer heat beat down on the crumbling tenement building, turning the air inside the cramped boiler room into an oven. Beads of sweat trickled down Bart's forehead, stinging his eyes as he tried to force the stubborn valve open.

This wasn't how Bart envisioned spending his Tuesday afternoon. He'd pictured himself lounging in Central Park with a cold beer, maybe catching a street performer or two. Instead, here he was, elbow-deep in a metal beast older than his grandmother, battling for a lukewarm shower for Mrs. Goldberg on the third floor.
