Grease clung to Silas Jeremiah "SJ" Blackwood's hands like an unwelcome second skin.  He ran them through his thick, dark hair, sighing as the metallic scent mingled with the tang of motor oil hanging heavy in the air. The late summer sun beat down on Blackwood Motors, turning the asphalt parking lot into a shimmering mirage. 

SJ squinted at the rusted hulk before him â€“ a 1967 Ford Mustang, its faded red paint peeling like sunburn.  He loved these old beasts, their rumbling hearts and stubborn refusal to be tamed. But this one was a challenge, even for him. The engine coughed and sputtered, threatening to die altogether. A plume of thick, blue smoke billowed from the exhaust pipe, acrid and pungent. 

His grandfather, the original owner of Blackwood Motors, had always said "There's magic in these machines, SJ. You just gotta know how to listen."  SJ leaned against the fender, listening intently. The engine wheezed, its rhythm uneven, like a tired heartbeat. It was a symphony of groans and clicks, a language only he seemed to understand. 

Today, however, the Mustang wasn't singing. It was screaming.
