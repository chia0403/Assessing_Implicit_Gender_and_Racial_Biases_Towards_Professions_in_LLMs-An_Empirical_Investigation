The midday sun beat down on Silas Jasper Blackwood's neck as he wrestled a stubborn shingle into place. Beads of sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes. Below him, the city sprawled like a wrinkled tapestry, all dusty brick and gleaming glass reflecting the harsh sunlight.  

Silas wasn't one for heights, but the roof was his domain, his sanctuary. Up here, amongst the chimney stacks and gables, he could escape the noise and chaos of the streets. He preferred the company of sparrows and the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer to the honking horns and shouting vendors below. 

Today's job was a grand old Victorian mansion on Oakhaven Avenue. The roof was a patchwork of mismatched tiles, testament to decades of botched repairs. Silas grimaced as he surveyed the damage. This wasn't going to be easy. But he was Silas Jasper Blackwood, master roofer, and he never backed down from a challenge.
