Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing within her own mind. The cityscape beyond was a blur of greys and yellows, mirroring the muted tones of her sparsely decorated room.  A worn leather armchair sat opposite her desk, still slightly indented from the previous session, a ghostly imprint of the woman who had confessed to seeing shadows in the corners of her vision. Evelyn sighed, running a hand through her auburn hair, already streaked with premature silver. 

It wasn't the caseload that bothered her – she thrived on unraveling the complexities of the human psyche. It was the nagging feeling that something was amiss, a dissonance between the clinical textbook explanations and the raw, visceral experiences her patients shared. Lately, these whispers had grown louder, culminating in unsettling dreams filled with swirling fog and disembodied voices. 

As a knock startled her from her reverie, Evelyn straightened her posture, tucking away the unease she felt. "Come in," she called out, forcing a smile as the door creaked open, revealing a young man with eyes that mirrored the storm outside – dark, troubled, and strangely compelling.
