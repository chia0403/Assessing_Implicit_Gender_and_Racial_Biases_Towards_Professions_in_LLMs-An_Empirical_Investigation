The wind whipped across Silas Blackwood's weathered face, carrying with it the sharp scent of rain and the promise of a hard frost. He squinted at the sky, a bruised canvas streaked with purple and orange, as he surveyed his fields. Rows of cornstalks, heavy with ripening ears, swayed precariously in the wind. Beyond them, pumpkin vines sprawled across the earth like emerald serpents, their plump orange fruit shimmering beneath the fading light. Silas' calloused fingers tightened around the handle of his pitchfork.  He knew this storm was coming, and he wouldn't be able to save everything.

This year had been a good one. The rains had come at just the right time, the sun had been generous, and Silas' hard work was paying off in the form of a bountiful harvest. But now, as darkness descended and the first fat raindrops began to fall, he felt a familiar knot of anxiety tighten in his chest. Farming was a constant dance with nature, a gamble against the elements. And tonight, Silas Blackwood was about to play a hand that could make or break him.
