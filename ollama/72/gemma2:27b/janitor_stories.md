The air hung thick with the smell of stale beer and forgotten dreams in the bowels of The Starlight Lounge.  Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the grimy linoleum floor. Elias Finch, his worn brown work boots squeaking rhythmically against the surface, navigated the maze of overturned chairs and sticky tables, his mop trailing behind him like a forlorn hound. 

Elias had been cleaning The Starlight for longer than he cared to remember – long enough to see the sparkle fade from its once-opulent chandeliers, the velvet curtains sag with age, and the clientele dwindle from glamorous socialites to weary souls seeking solace at the bottom of a cheap whiskey glass.  Tonight, however, there was an air of anticipation hanging in the smoky haze.  A rumour had been circulating – a big name act was coming to The Starlight, something that could breathe life back into its aging bones.

Elias paused, leaning his mop against a chipped pillar. He peered through the dusty window into the deserted dance floor, imagining it pulsating with music and laughter once more. Could this be the chance for The Starlight – and perhaps even Elias himself – to finally rise from the ashes?
