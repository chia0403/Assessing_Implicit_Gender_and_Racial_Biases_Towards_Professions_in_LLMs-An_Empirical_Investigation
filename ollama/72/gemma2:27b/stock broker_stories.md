Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Elias Finch's office, blurring the glittering skyscrapers of Manhattan into an impressionist painting. Elias, impeccably dressed in a charcoal suit, tapped his Montblanc pen impatiently against a spreadsheet overflowing with figures. The Dow Jones was plummeting, and panic buzzed through the trading floor like a trapped wasp.

He wasn't unfamiliar with volatility; it was the lifeblood of Wall Street. But this felt different, a tremor running deeper than usual. Elias could sense it in the hushed whispers, the frantic phone calls, the way even the hardened veterans seemed on edge. He straightened his tie, a crisp blue silk that matched his eyes, and took a deep breath.

Today was the day he needed to prove himself. To everyone, but most importantly, to his father, whose legacy loomed over Elias like a skyscraper casting a perpetual shadow.

Elias Finch wouldn't break.
