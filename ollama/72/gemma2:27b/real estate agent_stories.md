The salty tang of the ocean breeze whipped Eleanor "Ellie" Brighton's auburn hair across her face as she surveyed the sprawling Victorian on Ocean Drive. Its once-grand facade was now peeling paint and overgrown wisteria, but Ellie could see through the neglect. She envisioned the wraparound porch filled with wicker furniture, the scent of honeysuckle wafting through open windows, families gathered around a crackling fireplace in the spacious living room. 

This wasn't just another listing for Ellie; it was a chance to breathe life back into a piece of history. The house had been abandoned for years, whispered about in hushed tones by locals as "the Widow's Folly" after its last owner, a woman named Eleanor Sinclair, had disappeared mysteriously decades ago.

Ellie straightened her blazer, adjusting the nametag that read "Brighton Realty" with a glint of determination in her emerald green eyes. She was determined to sell this house, not just for the commission, but because she believed it deserved a second chance.
