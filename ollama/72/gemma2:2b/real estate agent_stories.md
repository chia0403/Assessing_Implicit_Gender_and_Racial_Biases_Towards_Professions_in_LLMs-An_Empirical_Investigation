The late afternoon sun bled across Willow Creek, turning the meticulously manicured lawns into a mosaic of golden hues.  Amelia "Amy" Finch, her signature red lipstick clashing beautifully with her crisp white blouse and tailored charcoal trousers, stood at the edge of a sprawling Victorian mansion on Elmwood Drive. It was a place that whispered secrets of wealth and heartbreak, of grand ambitions and faded glory. 

The house itself was a stately beast, its ornate facade adorned with intricate carvings and gleaming copper gutters. Ivy crept up the stone walls, framing delicate ironwork balconies overlooking manicured gardens bursting with colour. The windows, heavy oak frames, reflected the dying light like a kaleidoscope of amber, orange, and crimson. But even the majestic architecture couldn't hide the decay beneath the surface – cracked plaster, peeling wallpaper, and a sense of abandonment that hung thick in the air, a tangible presence in Amy’s heart. 

This was Elmwood Manor, and today, it belonged to the infamous Blackwood family -  a legacy shrouded in rumors and whispers of illicit business dealings and a missing heir who vanished without a trace years ago.  Amy had been assigned to handle the estate's sale – not just a property, but a story waiting to be unravelled. And as she stared at the silent mansion, her mind began to race with possibilities.
