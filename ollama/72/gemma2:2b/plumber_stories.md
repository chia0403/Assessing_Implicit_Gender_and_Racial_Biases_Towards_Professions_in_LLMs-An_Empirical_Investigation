The rain hammered against Thomas "Tom"  Cullen's worn-out Ford F-150 like a thousand tiny fists, each one leaving a wet trail on the windshield as he drove through the storm. His toolbox, overflowing with copper pipes and wrenches, rattled in protest as his headlights sliced through the swirling grey of a city choked by the downpour. Tom had been at this job for twenty years, and even after all this time, it never failed to bring a smile to his weathered face – despite the soaked leather of his gloves and the chill biting into his bones. 

He reached for a coffee mug from his passenger seat, already damp from the relentless downpour. "Don't mind if I do," he muttered, taking a long swig as he rolled into the alley behind Mrs. Henderson's Victorian mansion. The building itself was a monument to faded grandeur, its paint peeling and ivy creeping up its once-proud façade. A symphony of dripping pipes and groaning creaks echoed from within. It had been years since Tom had tackled any real plumbing jobs in this part of town. The mansion belonged to the old Miss Henderson, a recluse who only came out for occasional visits and never dared leave her home without a handmaid by her side. 

But tonight, something felt different – almost…urgent. A frantic message from his daughter's boyfriend, Mark, had alerted him to a potential plumbing emergency at the mansion. "She needs a hero," Mark had said, his voice thick with worry. And Tom knew, without a word being spoken, that it was his duty to answer the call.
