Rain lashed against the garage windows, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the already tense atmosphere inside.  The air hung thick with the smell of burnt oil and cheap cologne - an unholy mix that was somehow comforting to Lucas “Luke” Carter, owner and sole operator of "Carter's Car Clinic." He hunched over his workbench, fiddling with a cracked spark plug from an old Ford Fiesta that had been brought in for its third (and possibly last) attempt at passing emissions.  

Luke didn't care much about the cars themselves anymore. The thrill was gone, replaced by a dull ache of routine and a gnawing sense of isolation that felt more permanent than the worn-out leather seats in his little garage. He’d seen it all: busted transmissions, stolen hubcaps, and families crying on their knees while they tried to figure out how to pay for repairs that felt like an impossible task. 

The storm raged outside, but inside Carter's Car Clinic, everything was still as the old man who had once owned it before Luke - quiet, predictable, and tinged with a stubborn refusal to acknowledge the changing world beyond the steel beams of his garage door.
