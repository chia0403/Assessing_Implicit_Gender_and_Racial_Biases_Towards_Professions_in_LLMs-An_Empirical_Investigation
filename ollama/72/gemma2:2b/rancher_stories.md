The wind whipped off the endless plains, carrying with it dust devils dancing across the horizon like restless spirits.  It was a day like any other on the vast ranch owned by Jeremiah "Jericho" Thornton, though today felt different. Jericho's calloused hands clenched around his worn leather reins as he looked out over the rolling hills of Wyoming. 

The cattle were restless too, their low moans echoing across the parched land in a symphony that was both comforting and unnerving. This wasn't just any heat wave; it felt like the earth itself was straining, simmering beneath the relentless sun. It had been weeks since the first signs of drought appeared – a slow crawl from normalcy to something far more precarious.

Jericho tightened his jaw, watching as his trusty mare, Buttercup, pawed at the ground with impatience. His grandfather's words echoed in his mind: "Son, you ain't got no choice. This land will either nourish or break you. It depends on your grit." 

He was just a man facing an ancient adversary – the relentless power of nature that demanded respect and offered only its fickle mercy. The thought sent a knot twisting in his stomach as he saw the crimson glow paint the sky, setting the barren landscape ablaze. This wasn't just another hot day; it felt like the beginning of something truly terrifying.
