The fluorescent lights hummed above Detective Elias "Eli" Thorne as he surveyed the desolate alleyway. Rain hammered down like angry fists, turning the cobblestones into a slippery, churning mess. The air itself hung thick with the smell of stale piss and desperation.  He’d been here before, countless times in his eight years on the force, but nothing ever quite prepared him for the gut-wrenching reality of this city's underbelly. 

The alley was tucked away between a dingy pawn shop and a dilapidated nightclub, both places that seemed to exist solely to suck in the lost souls of the forgotten parts of town. Tonight’s call had been a standard domestic disturbance. But as Eli had found out when he arrived, the “disturbance” wasn't exactly what it seemed. A small, battered woman with wide, haunted eyes was curled up on the rain-slicked ground next to a crumpled purse, sobbing uncontrollably.  She claimed she had been robbed and assaulted by two men in black hoodies, their faces hidden beneath masks that obscured even their own features. 

Eli’s gaze darted towards the boarded-up windows of the nearby club, its neon sign flickering erratically like a dying star. The club's name, "The Raven's Shadow," seemed to echo the darkness that clung to this city and the storm raging above them. He pulled out his battered notebook, the one he used to record every detail in his meticulous way, only to realize the notes were already filled with an unnerving familiarity – a pattern too disturbing to ignore.
