## The Flour & Flame of Avani

**Setting:**  A small, quiet town nestled in the rolling hills of Cornwall. Mist clings to the cobblestone streets, shrouding the quaint shops and homes in an ethereal veil as dawn breaks. The air carries the faint scent of salt from the nearby coastline, a stark contrast to the sweet aroma of baking bread wafting from Avani’s kitchen window.

**Main Character:**  Avani Sharma – her heart beat like the rhythm of an old wood-fired oven, each thrumming pulse a familiar song of warmth and hope. Her small bakery, "The Flour Mill," stood on the edge of town, its walls adorned with hand-painted murals depicting scenes of local life: fishermen hauling in nets, children playing by the sea, and flour-dusted women kneading dough in sunlit kitchens. 

Avani's hands moved like water flowing through a river - swift and precise, yet gentle enough to coax the delicate rise of her sourdough starter.  The air shimmered with the warmth of the oven as she pulled out a loaf, its crust golden brown and radiating an inviting aroma that promised comfort and warmth. She wasn’t just baking bread; she was weaving tales into each slice, a symphony of flavors echoing through generations past. 

But today, a shadow hung heavy over Avani's spirit. The usual quiet hum of town life was replaced by a nervous tension that felt like an unseen hand squeezing her heart.  Rumors whispered on the wind about a storm brewing on the horizon - not just rain and wind, but something more sinister.
