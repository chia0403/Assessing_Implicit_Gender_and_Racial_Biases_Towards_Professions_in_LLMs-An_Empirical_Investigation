The aroma of ginger and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, blending with the sweet tang of freshly squeezed orange juice. It was a typical morning at "Nourish & Thrive", a small but bustling health food store nestled between a vintage bookstore and a vibrant flower shop. This was where Amelia Grant's world began - not as a bustling city dietitian, but as the quiet whisper in the backroom, carefully measuring out organic powders and concocting the most potent smoothie blends. 

Amelia sighed, her forehead creased with the weight of yet another late-night meeting with an anxious client whose gluten-free pasta cravings had escalated to full-blown obsession. "It's not just about what you eat," she murmured, blending a vibrant green concoction that promised to combat inflammation. The clock ticked down on the next hour - her lunch break - and Amelia knew even the quiet sanctuary of the store wouldn't shield her from the looming chaos that was the weight-loss industry.
