The usual symphony of tuk-tuks and chatter from street vendors seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling silence that had Amelia wondering if she’d somehow stepped into a poorly constructed movie scene.

Her gaze was sharp and piercing, usually accompanied by a smile and a playful wink, but today it was devoid of its usual warmth.  Amelia took a deep breath before answering, "Oh? What is it?"
