The fluorescent lights hummed above Elias Thorne's head like an angry hive. Every clink of metal against tile echoed through the sterile hallways of Blackwood University's sprawling library. The air hung thick with the scent of old paper and forgotten dreams - not unlike Elias himself, he often thought. He was just a janitor, his life as ordered as the rows of dusty bookshelves surrounding him, but tonight, something felt different. 

Elias straightened up, dusting a chipped porcelain statue of Minerva from its perch atop a high-backed chair. Tonight, the usual silence of the library seemed to crackle with anticipation, an energy that he'd never quite experienced before. The air was cold, and a strange scent - like cinnamon and old rain - lingered in the shadows. It felt… dangerous. He shrugged, his worn coat feeling heavier than usual, as he began his routine sweep. 

His gaze fell upon the back corner of the library, where a lone window illuminated a dusty table laden with books. A single page from one of them lay open, its edges curled and slightly smudged. The inscription on it was almost indecipherable; it seemed to glow in the muted moonlight that spilled through the window. Elias's heart skipped a beat. This place, this library, had always been an unyielding bastion of knowledge and quiet contemplation. Tonight, however, a tremor of something... else… ran through him.

He slowly made his way towards the table, drawn like a moth to a forbidden flame. He was about to touch it when a gust of wind slammed the library doors shut behind him. A wave of cold air swept in with a whisper of something ancient and unknown, and Elias knew that his life, as he had always known it, would never be the same.
