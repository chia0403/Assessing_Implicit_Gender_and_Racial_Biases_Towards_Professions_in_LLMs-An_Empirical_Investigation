## The Setting:

A bustling metropolis, bathed in the neon glow of a thousand streetlights. Above, the sprawling city skyline casts long shadows across the rain-slicked cobblestones.  The air is thick with exhaust fumes and the scent of curry from the nearby food stalls. 

**Name:** Elias Blackwood

## Opening:

Elias Blackwood adjusted his tie for the hundredth time in the last hour, its fabric damp from the constant drizzle. He tugged at his collar nervously, the weight of the latest sales pitch settling heavy on his chest like a lead apron. His eyes darted back and forth between the flickering screens on the corner display units and the endless stream of pedestrians rushing past. 

His job was to sell dreams, not just washing machines.  As Elias's mentor had often reminded him, "You sell something more than appliances, you sell hope." Today, however, that hope felt as fragile as the flimsy plastic prototypes he held in his hands. The prospectors, those with eyes wide enough to see opportunity where he saw only doubt, were already swarming past. He needed something... something more.
