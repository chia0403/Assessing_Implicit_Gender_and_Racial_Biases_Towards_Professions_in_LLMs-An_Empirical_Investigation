The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of Dr. Amelia Sinclair's office, painting patterns of gold and amber on the framed photographs lining the walls.  Amelia shifted uncomfortably in her chair as she stared at them.  She wasn't supposed to be dwelling on this. Not like she was now, with the memory of a woman's trembling hand clinging to her own, fingers tracing a faded blue ribbon tied around a tiny wooden box, before the frail smile vanished and Amelia saw the tears welling up in her patient's eyes. 

The small practice on Elmwood Avenue felt more like a sanctuary than anything else, filled with the warmth of countless stories told and lives improved. It was here that she had found solace, a place to heal not just physical ailments but also those hidden beneath the surface – scars both emotional and tangible left by years of chronic pain.  Now, Amelia's own hand tightened around her mug of chamomile tea as the weight of another patient's sorrow settled onto her shoulders, heavy and unyielding. 

The air hung thick with the scent of lavender oil - her favorite scent, a reminder that healing was possible, even in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges. But today, Amelia felt a nagging sense of unease, a feeling that something was amiss – an unwelcome undertow pulling at the edges of her carefully crafted world.
