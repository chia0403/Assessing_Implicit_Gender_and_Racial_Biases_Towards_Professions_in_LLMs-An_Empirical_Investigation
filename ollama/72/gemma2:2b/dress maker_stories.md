## The Velvet Heart 

Rain hammered against the attic window, each drop exploding like tiny fireworks on the glass. Inside, the air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the meagre light from Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's single gas lamp. She was hunched over a worn velvet fabric, its rich crimson hues almost muted by years of neglect. The scent of lavender and cedarwood – relics of a forgotten era – clung to the air like a faded memory.  

Years ago, her grandmother had entrusted Amy with her legacy - an antique sewing machine, a collection of hand-stitched patterns from generations past, and a worn workshop tucked away in the heart of Victorian London. The city's grandeur was a constant hum just outside these old wooden walls – a symphony of clattering carriages and roaring fire escapes – but within this attic space, Amy felt the timeworn echoes of her grandmother's quiet passion for making beautiful things. 


  
This is where she found solace, in the rhythmic tapping of needles against velvet, the scent of freshly-cut fabric, and the whisper of tales woven into every seam. And tonight, as a storm raged outside, Amy was determined to complete something special: a dress for her latest client, Miss Charlotte Blackwood.  Miss Blackwood, with her delicate frame and a soul burdened by tragedy, had commissioned an ethereal gown – a symphony of silk and lace, whispered promises of hope. 


Amy's fingers traced the pattern on the worn fabric, her eyes catching the faint glimmer of emerald embroidery stitched into its surface: a symbol of life and renewal. As she began to sew, a sense of purpose swelled within her, driving away the encroaching storm and reminding Amy that even in the darkest corners of life, beauty could always be found.
