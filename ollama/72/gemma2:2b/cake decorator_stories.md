The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Maple Street as Amelia "Amy" Frost carefully dusted powdered sugar over a towering chocolate creation. A swirl of rich ganache dripped down the side, leaving a trail of cocoa on her white apron. Amy's tiny bakery, Sugar & Spice, was tucked away in a corner of the bustling town square. The aroma of vanilla, cinnamon and a hint of old-fashioned sugar hung thick in the air, mingling with the lively chatter of residents enjoying their afternoon coffee breaks.

Amy stared at her masterpiece – a five-tiered cake sculpted to look like a whimsical forest scene, complete with miniature squirrels perched on branches of chocolate bark. It was for the annual Maple Festival's grand opening.  Every year, she poured her heart and soul into creating an extravagant centerpiece, but this year, there was something different, a lingering feeling of melancholy that clung to Amy's fingertips as she finished the last touch of icing.

The festival, a long-held tradition in their little town, meant everything to Amy – it was her chance to connect with her family and share her love for baking with the community.  But this year, her mother, Beatrice, the baker who had taught her everything about flour and sugar, wouldn't be there to see it all unfold.
