The humid Atlanta air hung thick like a shroud, clinging to Dr. Amelia "Amy" Wright's trench coat even as she stepped into the dank alleyway behind the courthouse.  A chill snaked down her spine despite the stifling August heat. It wasn't just the city's oppressive humidity that made this night unnerving; it was the unsettling silence, a void where the usual cacophony of honking cars and distant sirens should have been. 

Amy adjusted her glasses, squinting into the gloom as she observed the scene before her: a single flickering streetlight cast grotesque shadows on the cracked concrete, illuminating scattered debris and the skeletal frame of a once pristine red Porsche.  This was no accident; this was calculated. The forensic psychologist's sharp gaze landed on a crumpled business card lying beside the car, its image of an elegant woman with piercing blue eyes barely visible beneath a layer of dust.

"Ms. Evelyn Sinclair," she muttered to herself, tracing the name with her finger. "The missing heiress."
