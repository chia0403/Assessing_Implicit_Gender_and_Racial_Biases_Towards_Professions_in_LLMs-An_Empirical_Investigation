The sterile scent of disinfectant clung to Evelyn "Eve" Thorne like a shroud as she adjusted her mask. The hum of fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the rows of reclining chairs that lined the walls of the Serenity Wellness Center. Eve's gloved hands felt clammy, not from the late summer heat creeping through the thin metal door leading to the exam room, but from years spent in this business; she had grown numb to the chill and prickle of blood. 

Eve was a phlebotomist, a skilled hand at drawing blood with precision and a practiced coolness that masked her growing unease.  She was in charge today - responsible for keeping the patients comfortable as they surrendered their life essence for testing, and ensuring their anxieties didn't rise to a full-blown panic attack. It was more than just taking blood; it was understanding the story etched into each vein, the tales of joy and sorrow, love and loss that whispered through the flow of crimson. Today's patients were all here with a reason -  some for routine checkups, some for testing, some for a simple blood sugar test. 

But Eve couldn't shake off a feeling – an inexplicable sense of foreboding that lingered in the air like a phantom breeze. It was as though something was off; she just wasn’t sure what. The air seemed to crackle with unseen energy. This place, usually so serene and calm, felt charged with a silent tension that prickled her skin.  And it all started with Mrs. Olsen - the woman who sat waiting for her blood test at the far end of the room. Her name tag read 'Mrs. Olsen,' but Eve noticed something peculiar about the woman's gaze – a strange intensity behind the tired eyes, and a look that seemed to linger on Eve’s face as if she was trying to decipher some hidden truth in the phlebotomist's very being.
