Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tumultuous storm brewing inside her own head. The flickering streetlight outside cast long, distorted shadows across the worn floral cushions of the waiting room chairs.  She felt a familiar pang of weariness as she watched another set of anxious eyes peer out from behind the thin veil of teenage confidence, hoping for reassurance, or maybe just an escape. 

Eleanor, with her signature lavender cardigan and ever-present stack of books on trauma and childhood development, was used to this – but not to being so thoroughly drained by it all. She'd always been drawn to the human struggle, the yearning for connection and understanding that pulsated through every broken soul she encountered.  Tonight, though, as a new storm raged outside and an unspoken tension hung heavy in the air, Eleanor felt the line between hope and despair blurring into something more unsettling. Tonight, her patient's pain wasn't just about navigating adolescence; it was echoing with a deeper darkness that felt almost personal to Eleanor herself.  

"Come in, Sarah," she called out, her voice barely audible over the downpour.  This time, even the familiar comfort of her waiting room couldn’t quell the storm within.
