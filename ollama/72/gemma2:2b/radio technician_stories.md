## Story Opening

The air hung thick with static, mirroring the unease gnawing at the gut of Theodore "Teddy" Finch.  His fingers danced over the dials on his vintage analog radio, each click and whir serving as a metronome for the mounting tension in the room. Outside, rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the relentless pounding of his heart.

He adjusted the volume, the faint crackle of voices from the crackling black-and-white broadcast filling his ears.  "This is KDFH...," the announcer's voice echoed, "We are receiving a strong signal... from..." A sudden silence filled the air before an ominous tremor cut through the static.

Teddy gripped the microphone, sweat prickling on his palms as he strained to make out the words. The crackling grew louder, punctuated by frantic garbled bursts of unintelligible sounds.  A chill ran down his spine.  This wasn't a normal signal. This was something...else.


**Setting:**

The story takes place in a ramshackle workshop nestled on the outskirts of a quiet coastal town called Oakhaven. The building is a mishmash of salvaged materials, with exposed wiring and dusty tools hanging haphazardly from rafters. A worn leather briefcase sits prominently on the workbench, its contents as mysterious as the static humming through the airwaves.  The workshop serves as Teddy's haven - a space where he could escape the mundane world and delve into his passion for radio technology, seeking out the whispers of the unseen.
