The air hung heavy with jasmine and rain as Elara Pettigrew stood before her window, staring out at the muted cityscape sprawling below. The grey sky seemed to mirror the exhaustion that settled upon her like a shroud.  Even the vibrant blooms in her shop, "Petals of Peace," couldn't quite lift her spirits. It was a week since she lost Mr. Jenkins, her dear mentor and source of wisdom for all things floral, his gentle soul having been taken by a sudden stroke. 

The storefront itself seemed smaller these days, its cheery window display devoid of the usual playful chaos of Elara's arrangements.  She ran a hand through her chestnut-colored hair, frustration gnawing at her insides like a hungry wolf. "How can I possibly put together another memorial for him?" she whispered, her voice echoing the melancholy of the storm outside.
