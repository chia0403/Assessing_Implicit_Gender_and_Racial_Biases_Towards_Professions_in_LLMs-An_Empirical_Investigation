The air in Mrs. Henderson's small living room was thick with the scent of cinnamon and fear.  It clung to the worn floral couch like a forgotten memory. Her eyes darted frantically across the stack of papers on the coffee table - each one holding the weight of her year-end expenses, taxes she had been avoiding for weeks. This wasn’t Mrs. Henderson's first rodeo, not by a long shot.  But this year, it felt like even the familiar chaos was amplifying the anxiety that thrummed beneath the surface. 

Sitting across from her was Amelia "Amy" Hayes, her usual tax preparation client. Amy, with her signature silver bob and sharp wit, usually brought a dose of calm to Mrs. Henderson's world – a world she rarely wanted to delve into.  Today, though, Amy’s usual cheer felt muted, like the sound of rain on tin roof.  Her eyes were wide, haunted by something unseen. 

"It started subtly," she began, her voice raspy. "But it's spreading like wildfire now." She paused, her gaze flickering towards a picture frame tucked behind an overflowing file folder. "I saw... things I shouldn't have seen."


**Setting:** A small, cluttered apartment in the heart of Pittsburgh’s vibrant Oakland neighborhood.
