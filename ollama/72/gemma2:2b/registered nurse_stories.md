## The Scent of Eucalyptus

**Opening:** A gentle breeze rustled through the rows of lavender plants lining the entrance to Mercy's Home for the Elderly.  The air smelled of sunshine and antiseptic – a comforting combination for Amelia Grace Thornton, RN. It was her third month at the home, and she still couldn't quite get used to the scent clinging to every corner like a faded memory. She loved caring for the patients here - their stories woven into the fabric of the old house itself. But there was something about the lingering aroma that felt bittersweet, a reminder of what was left unsaid, what was buried beneath years of laughter and tears.

**Setting:** Mercy's Home for the Elderly is nestled amidst rolling hills in rural Vermont. The home itself is a Victorian marvel with ivy creeping up its weathered brick walls and stained glass windows framing dusty memories of Christmases past.  Each floor is adorned with unique art, each piece a reminder of a life lived. Yet, despite the charm, the air held a somber weight that Amelia felt acutely. There was something about Mercy's Home – an unspoken story within the very bricks and mortar.
