Rain lashed against the workshop windows like furious hammers on ancient wood. Inside, dust motes danced in the pale beams of Isaac Thorne's lantern, their shadows stretching long fingers across the floorboards as the storm raged outside. The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and pine, a comforting familiarity that never quite matched the unsettling hum of thunder that seemed to resonate deep within his bones. 

Isaac had been at it for hours, whittling down a stubborn piece of oak he'd found in the back corner of Mrs. Hemlock's barn yesterday. The wood was old, marked with the scars of countless storms and years. Every day, he dreamt of crafting something special from this forgotten beauty - something to stand proud against time's relentless march. 

He ran his calloused fingers over the rough surface of the wood, a deep sigh escaping him. This particular piece felt different. It carried an undercurrent of sadness, like a whisper from long-gone storms and memories held in its fibers. It was as if the wood itself was weeping for something lost.  


**Setting:** A small, ramshackle workshop in a seaside village nestled amongst rolling hills. The air is thick with the smell of salt spray and damp earth. 

**Main Character:** Isaac Thorne, a carpenter known for his skill and quiet demeanor. He carries a heavy burden of loneliness in his heart and finds solace in the woods and weathered wood that remind him of life's enduring strength.
