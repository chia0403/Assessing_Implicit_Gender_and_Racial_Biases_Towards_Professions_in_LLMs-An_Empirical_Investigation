The rain hammered against the windowpanes of The Rusty Mug, each drop exploding into miniature explosions on the glass. Inside, the air hung thick with smoke from countless cigarettes and the scent of stale beer.  Rainwater dripped slowly from the rusted metal awning outside, echoing the slow drip of melancholy in the heart of bartender Elias Thorne. He was known by many as El – a name whispered in hushed tones for his uncanny ability to brew magic into even the dregs of forgotten dreams. Tonight, however, the usual symphony of chatter and clinking glasses seemed muted; the familiar buzz of regulars was replaced with an oppressive quiet that only served to amplify Elias's weariness.

Elias ran a calloused hand through his greying hair, his eyes glued to the swirling amber liquid in his hands as he poured another generous measure into a chipped glass. The customer, a man whose face was etched with worry lines deep enough to hold rivers of stress, sat slumped at the bar, his gaze fixed on the storm outside, mirroring Elias's internal storm. He hadn’t come here for a drink; he wasn't looking for solace.  He had come seeking an answer.
