##  The Whispering Woods

**Setting:** A remote, ancient forest in the heart of Alaska. Sunlight filters through the dense canopy of towering pines, casting dappled shadows across the moss-covered earth. The air hangs heavy with humidity and the scent of pine needles and damp soil. 

**Main character:** **Elias Thorne**, a weathered logger with hands calloused from years of wielding an axe and years of staring into the heart of a forest's secrets. His beard, streaked with grey, is as wild and untamed as the woods themselves, mirroring his gruff, taciturn nature. 

**Opening:**  A low groan echoed through the ancient trees, the sound like a mournful sigh carried on the wind. Elias paused, his boots silent on the gravel path leading to the stand. His eyes, usually hardened with a lifetime of toil and survival, were now focused on the source of the noise. A massive Douglas fir stood in defiance of time, its trunk twisted and gnarled, leaving a trail of broken branches and splintered wood. The groaning started again, a rhythmic rasp that seemed to whisper through Elias's very bones. 

"What’s going on out there?" he muttered, his voice as rough as the bark he worked with every day. He squared his shoulders, lifting the worn leather-bound axe strapped across his chest. "You old bastard," he grumbled, shaking a fist at the groaning wood, "you’ve got me wondering if you're trying to play tricks on me." 

He knew better than anyone the secrets these ancient woods held, their own silent language woven into the very soil beneath his boots. Tonight, however, the whispers felt different, laced with a fear he hadn't encountered in years. The forest was holding its breath, and Elias felt it too - a sense of something…other, lurking just beyond the veil of familiar shadows.
