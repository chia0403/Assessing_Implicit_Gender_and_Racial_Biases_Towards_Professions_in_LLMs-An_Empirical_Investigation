##  The Bookkeeper's Secret

**Setting:** A quaint seaside town nestled amongst rolling hills in Cornwall. The air smells perpetually salty, tinged with a hint of woodsmoke from a nearby pub. Sunlight dapples through the old, crooked windows of "Scrivener's End," a small but bustling bookshop run by Agnes Bellweather. 


**Character:**  Elsie Bellweather - known affectionately as Elsie "Digits" Bellweather amongst her colleagues for her impeccable attention to detail and meticulous record keeping. At forty years old, Elsie is a quiet woman who finds solace in the rhythmic tick-tock of clocks and the comforting weight of paper ledgers. But beneath her unassuming exterior lies a secret she guards fiercely:  a hidden talent for magic. 

**Opening:**

The worn leather cover of an ancient book lay open on Elsie’s desk, its yellowed pages whispering tales of forgotten times. The sea breeze outside tugged at the windowpane, rustling through the dusty tomes lining the shelves. Elsie traced a finger across a faded illustration of a fantastical creature with shimmering wings, her heart beating in a measured rhythm to the song of the waves crashing below.  She was good at her job, but tonight, as she delved deeper into the intricate workings of the ancient book, it felt like magic itself had been awakened within her –  a secret too dangerous, too powerful for the world outside this small bookstore to ever understand.
