The crisp air of the morning bit at Dr. Eleanor Blackwood's cheeks as she stepped out into the dew-laden meadow.  Sunlight filtered through the towering pines, casting dappled shadows across the field where her office sat nestled amidst rolling hills and vibrant wildflowers. The scent of pine needles mingled with the sweet aroma of freshly cut grass, a familiar comfort in the heart of rural Vermont. 

Eleanor had always known this place would be her home.  She’d grown up here, spent countless summers exploring its winding trails and patching up the scrapes and bruises of local critters. Now, as she stepped into her clinic – "Blackwood Animal Wellness" with its bright red door and cheerful sign depicting a happy dog - the familiar feeling came full circle. Today, however, was a day for much more than routine checkups and deworming sessions; it was the first day Eleanor would be meeting the new resident of Blackwood Farm: a majestic black stallion named Midnight who'd been rescued from a traveling circus and had arrived with his past shrouded in mystery.
