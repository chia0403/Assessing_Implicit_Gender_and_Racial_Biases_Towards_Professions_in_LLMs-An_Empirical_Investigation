He glanced at his worn-out work boots, their leather cracked and stained from months of constant use, and a familiar sense of weary resignation settled in his stomach.  Mr. Hawthorne’s family had promised him a good sum for the job and a chance to finally move out of the cramped trailer he shared with his sister back home. But so far, there was just endless rain, aching muscles, and a gnawing emptiness.
