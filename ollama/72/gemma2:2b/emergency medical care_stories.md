The neon lights of the city pulsed against the velvet sky like an oversized heart. Rain slicked the cracked asphalt, reflecting the holographic advertisements that glowed like fireflies in a storm. Every sound felt amplified in this concrete jungle – the screech of tires, the rumble of a distant siren, even the soft "thump" of Amelia's boots on the wet pavement. 

Amelia, known as "Amie" to those who truly knew her, had always thrived in chaos. As an EMT with the city's notoriously understaffed medical response unit, she moved through life at a frenetic pace, each minute a crucial rhythm. Tonight was no different.  She clutched her bag of essential equipment, its familiar weight a comfort in the darkness, as she pulled up to the alleyway entrance marked with an emergency call light. 

It wasn't just the adrenaline pumping through her veins - it was the weight of another life hanging precariously in the balance. This time, it was young Maya, who was bleeding from a gash on her arm and unconscious.  "Don’t worry," Amie whispered to herself, a silent promise to fight for the girl's life as she had promised countless times to do.
