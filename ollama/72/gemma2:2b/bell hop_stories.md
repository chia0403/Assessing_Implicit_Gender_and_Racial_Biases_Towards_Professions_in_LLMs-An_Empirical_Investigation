The air in the lobby was thick with cigar smoke and the ghosts of forgotten dreams.  Dust motes danced in the shafts of weak sunlight that pierced through the grime-coated windows, illuminating the worn velvet upholstery of the waiting chairs. A faint tune drifted from somewhere beneath the floorboards - a melancholy blues riff, perhaps? This was Edgar Thorne's domain. He stood behind the front desk, his crisp white uniform dusted with an impossible amount of dust, a silent sentinel watching as weary travelers stumbled into this forgotten corner of New York City. 

Edgar, a young man with eyes that held too much world-weariness for his years and a smile that hid a wellspring of unspoken stories, was the epitome of the fading grandeur of this once-magnificent hotel. The name "Grand Astoria" was etched in faded gold on a plaque above the door, a silent testament to its former glory days before the city swallowed it whole.
