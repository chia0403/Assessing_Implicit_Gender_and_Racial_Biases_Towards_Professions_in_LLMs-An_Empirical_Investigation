## The Whispering Willow

**Setting:** A quaint seaside cottage nestled amongst towering eucalyptus trees in coastal New Zealand. Rain pattered on the old windows, creating a soft, rhythmic melody. 

**Characters:**

* **Eleanor "Ellie" Campbell:** A young woman with fiery red hair, always sporting a mischievous smile and boundless energy. She's a child care worker, tasked with looking after the rambunctious bunch of children who call her "Aunty Ellie."


The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cluttered playroom, illuminating dust motes swirling in the air. The scent of vanilla and cinnamon hung heavy from a simmering pot on the stove, but Ellie couldn't resist the allure of a game of chase with the little ones. 

"Come on, you lot!" she exclaimed, her voice brimming with infectious enthusiasm. "Let's have a proper hide-and-seek adventure!"  The children, all bundled in brightly colored clothes and sporting wide grins, scampered around like playful sparks, their laughter echoing in the wooden cabin of the cottage. 

Suddenly, a hush fell over the room as Ellie caught sight of something peculiar: a single willow tree swaying slightly in the wind, its leaves whispering secrets only she could hear. A feeling of unease crept up her spine, an inexplicable tension that seemed to cling to the air like cobwebs. 


"What's that, you little devils?" Ellie asked, her voice tinged with both amusement and a hint of fear.  Her eyes darted towards the willow tree as if seeking a visual explanation for the whispering murmurs. It felt too quiet, too still. The children, oblivious to Ellie's sudden change in demeanor, ran off giggling, leaving Ellie standing alone amidst the fading sunlight. A strange, tingling feeling settled on her fingertips. 


**Opening Prompt:**

Ellie had never been a superstitious person. But tonight, she found herself drawn into a world of whispers and shadows, where the wind carried secrets too profound for anyone's understanding, even those who cared most about her little charges.  What would Ellie uncover in the heart of the whispering willow?
