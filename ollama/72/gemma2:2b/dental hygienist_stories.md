Rain lashed against the windowpanes of The Emerald Smile, blurring the streetlights into shimmering halos of light. Inside, Eleanor Thorne, known affectionately by patients as "Ellie," meticulously cleaned a patient's molar.  Her hands moved with practiced grace, their rhythmic scrubbing and swirling motions echoing the hypnotic rhythm of the rain outside. Ellie was an anomaly in this world – her own internal clock seemed to run on a different beat, one where every detail mattered: the exact temperature of the water used for rinsing, the precise angle of the gauze pad after each cleaning, the slow, deliberate way she would lay out her dental tools before she began. 

A faint aroma of cinnamon and vanilla lingered in the air, a signature scent Ellie had instilled in The Emerald Smile – a blend that both soothed and grounded her.  But tonight, the usual comfort of this familiar space felt tinged with unease. An unsettling tightness pulsed beneath Ellie's ribcage as she finished up with the cleaning, a feeling far beyond mere exhaustion or anticipation of an evening shift. It was the quiet before the storm, a premonition that whispered something was about to unravel.
