Rain slicked the cobblestones, blurring the gaslights into hazy halos of yellow. Each gust seemed to carry a whisper of melancholy, reflecting off the rain-streaked windows of the grand Victorian hotel. Inside, Elara "Ellie" Beaumont fidgeted nervously as she balanced a tray piled high with steaming cups of coffee and plates of freshly baked scones. The air was thick with the scent of cinnamon and old books; an aroma that normally brought Ellie comfort, but tonight it did little to soothe the knot in her stomach.  The once vibrant lobby now seemed hushed and desolate, the usual buzz of chatter replaced by a tense quiet. 
Ellie wasn't sure what had triggered this sudden shift in mood â€“ maybe the recent arrival of a new family for their annual Christmas stay at the Grand Blackwood; or perhaps it was just the relentless December chill that seeped into every inch of the hotel.  But tonight, there was a sense of dread settling upon Ellie, making each step on her worn wooden floor seem heavy and slow. 
The only thing that felt normal was the steady rhythm of pouring coffee, the faint melody of jazz music escaping from the dusty old gramophone in the corner, and the ever-present presence of Mrs. Blackwood's prized black cat, Midnight, who seemed to be watching her with feline disapproval.  Tonight, however, Ellie was determined to keep her fear at bay.  After all, she had always been a beacon of cheer for the guests, even when the world outside felt like a storm brewing on its own.
