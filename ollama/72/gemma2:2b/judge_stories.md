The crisp, white cuffs of Judge Amelia Beaumont's pristine judicial robes were damp with sweat. A bead of perspiration trickled down her temple as she stared at the ornate mahogany desk, its surface slick with the weight of countless past cases and future anxieties. The humid New Orleans air pressed in, carrying the pungent aroma of jasmine and freshly-baked beignets from the corner cafe where, just moments ago, a trial had concluded.  Amelia was alone in her chambers, the only sound the incessant ticking of the grandfather clock nestled against the wall, each beat echoing like a drumroll of impending doom. 

**The case: **A man named Gabriel Moreau stood accused of murdering his wife in a jealous rage. It was the kind of seemingly-straightforward crime that Amelia had been handling for years, but this one had gnawed at her ever since it came before her - something about the way Moreau's eyes seemed to hold a haunted flicker of regret or maybe fear.  The weight of the case pressed down on her, its gravity amplified by the history she saw etched in the worn wood of her desk and the ornate carvings of the judge's chair beneath her.
