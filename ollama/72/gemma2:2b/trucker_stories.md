The sun was bleeding out over the endless horizon, painting the sky in shades of bruised plum and dying ember as Clayton “Big Wheel” Miller adjusted his mirror one last time.  His beat-up Peterbilt, affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," rumbled its way down the dusty Route 66, a ribbon of concrete slicing through the vast expanse of the American Southwest. Big Wheel was hauling a load of recycled scrap metal from Phoenix to Albuquerque, a journey he’d made countless times in his years on the road. He was a man of routines, both literally and figuratively – each sunrise at dawn marked the start of another day, another mile marker on the highway of life. 

But today, something felt different.  A gnawing unease settled over him like a persistent dust storm. The usual symphony of engine rumble and wind's lonely song seemed amplified, each note tinged with an undercurrent of fear. Big Wheel tightened his grip on the steering wheel, his eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of trouble. He was used to the solitude of the open road, but this stillness felt ominous, like a storm brewing just outside the window.  The only sounds breaking the silence were the faint chatter of the radio and the low hum of Betsy's aging engine.
