The aroma of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air like a shroud as Dr. Amelia Cartwright, a seasoned school psychologist with more gray than white in her hair, sat at her desk.  The flickering fluorescent lights of Willow Creek Elementary cast long shadows across the cramped office, each one seemingly pregnant with a million unanswered questions about the children she was meant to help. 

It was the middle of May, and the air thrummed with the anxieties of summer approaching. Amelia's mind churned with the usual symphony of childhood struggles: the anxiety that clung like cobwebs to young Emilyâ€™s forehead after her recent fight with another girl; the silent sobs of Daniel, who seemed perpetually burdened by the weight of an unspoken secret; and the unfocused gaze of Michael, whose dreams seemed to be scattered on a thousand different pages.  Each one, a puzzle piece in a larger mosaic she had yet to understand fully. 

Tonight, though, was different. Tonight, the quiet hum of the office felt charged with something else - an edge that cut through the air like a sharpened pencil against paper. The storm outside mirrored the growing turmoil within Amelia's soul, as she watched the rain lash against the windowpane and wondered if these children were simply pawns in a larger game she had yet to comprehend.
