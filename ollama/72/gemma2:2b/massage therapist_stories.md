Rain hammered against the windows of "Serenity Massage," an insistent rhythm mirroring the anxieties churning within Elara Thorne's stomach. Outside, the Seattle skyline was cloaked in swirling grey, but inside, warm amber light bathed her work space â€“ a haven of soft textures and calming colours she meticulously curated.  She adjusted the lavender oil diffuser, letting its fragrant wave wash over the waiting area, where a woman named Amelia sat on a plush chair, fiddling with the strap of a worn handbag. 

Elara's mind wasn't at ease. She was known for her gentle touch and ability to soothe even the most deeply-entrenched tensions, yet this session felt different, heavier than usual. Amelia, a prominent lawyer in the city's legal elite, had been plagued by an unsettling weight ever since she inherited a family secret: a story that promised untold danger if unearthed. Elara was used to helping people escape stress and pain through her massage techniques; tonight, she felt like she was facing down something far more primal - a sense of dread that tugged at the edges of her own composure.
