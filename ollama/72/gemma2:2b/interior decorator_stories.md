## Opening:

The air hung thick with the scent of freshly-sprayed linen and citrusâ€”a curious blend that usually signified the start of another renovation project at the edge of the Grand Canyon National Park.  For Theodore "Teddy" Thorne, it was like perfume for the soul, a reminder of his quiet escape from the chaos of Los Angeles. Today, however, the scent did little to soothe the knot tightening in Teddy's chest as he surveyed the sprawling ranch-style house. 

The house belonged to Eleanor Blackwood, an eccentric widow whose family had built their fortune on mining diamonds in the heart of the Nevada desert. Teddy had been tasked with transforming the once-grand home into a modern haven for her youngest daughter, Avery, before she began college at UCLA. The challenge was twofold:  restore the historic charm while making the space feel vibrant and fresh for a young woman who preferred art galleries to old books and Instagram over dusty journals.

**Setting:**

The house nestled amidst sprawling red rock formations and whispering pines, overlooking the vast expanse of the Grand Canyon. The landscape held a stark beauty that echoed the raw emotions swirling within Teddy's mind - his desire to escape, to create something beautiful while simultaneously yearning for the familiar comforts of his life in LA.
