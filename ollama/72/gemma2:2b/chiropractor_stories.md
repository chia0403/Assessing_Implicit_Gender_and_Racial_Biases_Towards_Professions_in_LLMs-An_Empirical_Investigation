The rain hammered against the warped tin roof of Dr. Ethan Sterling's office, mimicking the relentless beat of his migraine.  Ethan grimaced, rubbing his temples as he adjusted a patient's spine with practiced ease. His tiny office in the heart of Millwood Village was a world away from the sleek sterile environments he’d worked in during his residency in Chicago. Yet, amidst the chipped paint and creaky floors, Ethan found solace in this familiar space, in the way he could literally move bodies back into alignment, even if only momentarily.

Ethan wasn't born with the gentle touch that seemed to soothe all ailments, it was a skill honed by years of practice and a genuine desire to help. His patients weren’t just people who sought relief from aches and pains; they were individuals struggling through life's daily battles – the tired mom after another round of soccer games, the overworked businessman seeking stress-free nights, the heartbroken single father trying to mend a shattered heart. 

He knew the power he held in his hands, but sometimes, even with years of experience, it felt like an impossible equation:  the weight of their anxieties, the burden of their expectations, and the relentless march of time all conspired to leave him feeling equally burdened and yet inexplicably hopeful. Tonight, however, Ethan wasn’t just treating a patient's body; he was facing his own internal battle against fatigue and the ever-present pressure of balancing his personal life with his demanding profession.
