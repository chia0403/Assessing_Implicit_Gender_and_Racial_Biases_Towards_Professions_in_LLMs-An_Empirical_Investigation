The city hummed beneath Amelia Thorne's feet like a restless giant, its steel veins pulsating with the rhythm of 200,000 lives.  Amelia stared up at the towering glass skyscrapers, their reflective surfaces blurring her vision as she walked through the maze of concrete and glass streets that made up Neo-Manhattan. Her fingers skimmed across the sleek surface of her tablet, pulling up blueprints for a new public housing development - an ambition born from years spent fighting against the city's callous disregard for its poorest citizens. 

Tonight, however, Amelia wasn't focused on blueprints. Tonight was about escape. She slipped into the small jazz bar tucked away on a forgotten side street, a place where the music washed over her like warm waves and the dim lights cast long shadows that danced to the rhythm of the melody. Here, in this haven of faded velvet and smoky air, Amelia found solace.  She had built her career on creating order from chaos; she'd spent years mastering the blueprint for a life worth living, but tonight, she needed something more...something unexpected, something free.
