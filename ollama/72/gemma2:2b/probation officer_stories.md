Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Ms. Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the torrent of emotions churning within her gut. She glanced at the photograph on her desk - a younger version of Michael "Mickey" O’Brien, his mischievous grin etched in time and memory. Ten years had passed since Mickey, the charming young artist she was entrusted to oversee during his probation for petty theft, had vanished. 

Evelyn's life in this small-town probation office was a tapestry woven with routine and quiet desperation. Every day was a battle against apathy and societal indifference. Yet, every case held a hidden thread of hope - a flicker of redemption amidst the ashes of broken lives. Until Mickey.  He wasn’t just a statistic; he was her lost muse, the artist who once filled her life with vibrant hues. 

The rain outside matched the tempest brewing in Evelyn's mind as she pulled out the worn-out file folder containing Mickey's case details: probation violation reports, letters from his mother pleading for him to "come home," and a single polaroid of him standing before a vibrant mural - a masterpiece she swore he would never finish.
