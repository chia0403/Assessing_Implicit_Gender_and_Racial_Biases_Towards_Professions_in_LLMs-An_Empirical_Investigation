Rain hammered against the attic window, its rhythmic percussion mimicking the frantic beating of Elara’s heart. Dust motes danced in the single ray of sunlight slicing through the grime-coated grimoire, illuminating the faded script etched into its aged cover. She traced the ornate symbols with her calloused fingertips, a wave of nausea rising as she read through the archaic text. This was it. The missing chapter, the one that promised to unlock the secrets to restoring her patients’ damaged minds and bodies.

Her sessions, held in a hidden workshop beneath the bustling streets of New Albion City, were as much about healing broken limbs as about mending shattered dreams.

The attic, an abandoned storage space tucked away behind Elara's ramshackle clinic, felt like another patient - fragile, burdened with secrets best left buried. The air hung thick with the scent of decaying wood and forgotten memories, a potent concoction that stirred unease in her gut. This wasn’t just about deciphering ancient texts; it was about unraveling the mysteries of her own past, and those of her patients, who she felt were inexplicably connected to this hidden corner of history.
