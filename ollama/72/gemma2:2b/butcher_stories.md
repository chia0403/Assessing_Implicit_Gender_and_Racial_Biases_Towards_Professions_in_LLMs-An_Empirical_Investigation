The scent of salt pork and aged leather hung thick in the air, clinging to Elias Thorne's worn apron like an unwelcome shadow. He wiped his forehead with the back of his hand, sweat prickling beneath his skin as he surveyed his domain: The Butcher's Block.  Its wooden frame, scarred from years of wielding blades and battling stubborn roasts, stood stoic against the morning light filtering through the grime-covered windows. Outside, a steady drizzle painted the cobblestones in shades of gray, mirroring the gloom settling upon Elias' spirit. He wasn't accustomed to this mood. Not after twenty years spent coaxing life from every carcass that crossed his threshold.

Elias Thorne, the son of an esteemed butcher, was no stranger to the demands of the trade. But today, even the familiar rhythm of meat preparation couldn't chase away the gnawing unease in his gut. It had started with a letter, a single sheet announcing the arrival of a new merchant at the edge of the market. A merchant who specialized in… what Elias now dared to call exotic meats. His words were hesitant, but he’d found himself drawn to the mystery, as if some unseen force was whispering his name. 

The rain intensified, drumming on the roof like the beat of a frantic heart.  Something was amiss. Something sinister. And it had started with the arrival of the merchant and the unsettling aroma of something… different, something wild and unknown. Elias knew he would have to face the truth sooner or later.  His gut whispered; his instincts screamed.
