## The Whispering Walls 

**Setting:** Maplewood High School - A sprawling, ivy-covered building with an air of quiet desperation clinging to it like morning fog. 

**Character:**  Eleanor Vance, her heart heavy and weary as she walked the halls, her usually bright smile replaced by a subtle furrow in her brow. She was more than just a guidance counselor at Maplewood; she was a ghost from its past, haunted by the unspoken tragedies of countless students who had crossed paths with her over the years. 

**Story Opening:**  The bell's shrill cry echoed through the hallway as Eleanor navigated the sea of teenage bodies, their faces mirroring an undercurrent of anxiety and angst. She stopped at the empty guidance counselor's office, its worn-out door seeming to whisper unspoken secrets in her ear. A faint scent of cinnamon lingered, hinting at a forgotten lunchbox and the lingering trace of a student who had poured his heart out years ago.  As she pulled open the door, Eleanor was greeted by an unsettling stillness. 

"Hello?" Eleanor's voice echoed through the room, bouncing off the worn linoleum floor and leaving behind a hollow silence. 


**Prompt:** What secrets does the old office hold? Why did the student leave his lunchbox here? And what kind of new tragedy awaits the guidance counselor at Maplewood High School?
