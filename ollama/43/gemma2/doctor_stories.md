The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and simmering fear in Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's operating room. A pale shaft of light sliced through the grime-streaked windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the stale air. Outside, the city of New Alexandria hummed with its usual frenetic energy – a symphony of screeching trams, barking vendors, and distant siren wails – but here, within the steel and glass confines of Mercy General Hospital's most dilapidated operating theatre, there was only the rhythmic hiss of the oxygen tank and the frantic thump of Ellie's own heart. 

The patient, a young man barely old enough to shave, lay still on the cold metal table, his chest heaving with shallow breaths. His name was Kai, and he was bleeding out from a wound so deep, so brutal, that even Ellie’s seasoned hands trembled slightly as she prepped her instruments. This wasn't just another gunshot victim; this was personal. 


This wasn’t just another surgery.
