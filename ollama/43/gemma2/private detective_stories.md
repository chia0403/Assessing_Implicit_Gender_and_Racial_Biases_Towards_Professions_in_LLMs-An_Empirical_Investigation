The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office, a rhythm as familiar to him as his own heartbeat. It was the kind of relentless downpour that made the city of New Albion feel claustrophobic, every inch soaked and shimmering under the dim glow of gas lamps.  

Bart sat hunched over a chipped mahogany desk, smoke curling from a half-smoked cigarette balanced precariously on the edge. His face, framed by a mess of prematurely grey hair, was etched with the weariness only years spent unraveling other people's tangled lives could bring. A crumpled photograph lay beside a cracked glass of whiskey – a young woman with eyes that held both fire and sadness. It was Amelia Thorne, Bart’s last case, and the one that had haunted him ever since her disappearance.  

The bell above his door chimed, jolting Bart from his reverie. A new client, seeking answers in the murky labyrinth of New Albion's underbelly. 


Bart hoped this one wouldn't be as heartbreaking as the last.
