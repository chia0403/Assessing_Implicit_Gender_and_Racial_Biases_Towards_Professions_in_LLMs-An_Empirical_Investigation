The sun beat down on Beatrice "Bea" Hartley's neck as she adjusted her hard hat. Sweat slicked her forehead, mingling with dust kicked up by the passing eighteen-wheelers. The roar of engines was a constant companion on Highway 17, slicing through the humid Georgia air like hot knives. Bea squinted at the horizon, the asphalt shimmering in the distance under the oppressive heat.  

She wiped her brow with the back of her gloved hand, leaving a trail of dirt across her face. Another scorcher of a day, just like the last twenty. This stretch of highway, snaking its way through the heart of rural Georgia, was notorious for its brutal summers. 


Bea took a swig from her water bottle, grimacing at the lukewarm liquid. She scanned the endless ribbon of blacktop, searching for any signs of trouble. Today's job: patching potholes, a tedious task made infinitely worse by the relentless sun and the deafening din of traffic.
