Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Dr. Amelia Rosalind Hayes' office, blurring the lights of the city below into an abstract watercolour painting.  The storm was a reflection, she thought, of the tempest brewing within her patient, Michael – or at least that's what his frantic phone call earlier had suggested. 

Michael had been her patient for three months, battling crippling anxiety and insomnia. He’d always been hesitant to talk about the specifics, shrouding his pain in vague phrases like "feeling lost" and "unable to cope."  But tonight, something was different. His voice crackled with urgency, a desperate plea hidden beneath a forced calm. 

Amelia took another sip of her lukewarm tea, the ginger trying desperately to quell the knot of worry twisting in her stomach. It was almost ten o'clock, well past her usual quitting time, but Michael’s distress echoed through her mind, demanding her attention. She flicked on the lamp beside her desk, casting warm shadows across the sparsely decorated room – a testament to her belief that clutter mirrored a cluttered mind. 


He was coming tonight.  And Amelia knew this wasn't just another therapy session.
