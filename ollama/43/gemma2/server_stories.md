The air hung thick with the scent of simmering garlic and oregano, punctuated by the sharp tang of bleach from the relentless cleaning cycle.  A symphony of clinking dishes and hushed conversations played out around Amelia “Amy” Rosewater as she weaved between tables at 'La Bella Notte', a charmingly kitschy Italian restaurant tucked away on a quiet street in Chicago's Little Italy. The red-and-white checkered tablecloths were worn thin from years of spilled wine and shared laughter, the walls adorned with framed photos of smiling locals enjoying plates piled high with spaghetti and meatballs.  

Amy, balancing a precarious stack of plates laden with steaming lasagna, felt the familiar buzz of energy that came with Friday night rush. She was a master of the art, gracefully dodging elbows and wayward napkins while delivering orders with a smile as warm as the bread baskets she carried. 


Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced at the back of her neck, like a whisper of unease carried on the scent of garlic and tomato sauce. She couldn't shake the feeling that tonight was going to be anything but ordinary.
