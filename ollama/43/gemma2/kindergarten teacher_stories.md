This was Ms. Amelia Evergreen's world: a whirlwind of glitter glue, misplaced dinosaurs, and tiny humans bursting with boundless energy. Her classroom, affectionately nicknamed "The Enchanted Forest" thanks to its hand-painted murals and whimsical decorations, was her sanctuary, a place where imagination ran wild and learning felt like an adventure.

She gently stroked the head of little Oliver Thompson, whose bottom lip trembled as he clutched his favorite stuffed bear, Mr. Snuggles.
