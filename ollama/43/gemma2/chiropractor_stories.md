The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Evelyn “Eve” Hayes’s office. Dust motes danced in the golden light filtering through the blinds, illuminating the rows of neatly stacked brochures promising pain relief and spinal alignment. The air held the faint scent of eucalyptus oil and liniment, a familiar comfort to Eve after years spent coaxing bodies back into harmony.

Outside, the city hummed with its usual frenetic energy, but inside her clinic, nestled on a quiet side street, there was a stillness that felt almost sacred.  It was here, amidst the soothing music and soft glow of the Himalayan salt lamp, that Eve found peace. Here, she wasn't just Dr. Hayes, the chiropractor with a reputation for miracle cures; she was a confidante, a healer, and sometimes, even a friend. 


This tranquility was shattered by the insistent buzzing of her office phone, pulling Eve from her quiet contemplation. She sighed, answering with a practiced smile in her voice. “Dr. Hayes’s office, how can I help you?”
