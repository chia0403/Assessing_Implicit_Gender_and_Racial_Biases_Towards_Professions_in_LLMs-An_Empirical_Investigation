The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine as Amelia Beatrice Sinclair stepped out onto the balcony. Dawn was just breaking over Mumbai, casting a soft, apricot glow across the sprawling cityscape below.  Amelia, her blonde hair pulled back in a loose braid, inhaled deeply, letting the symphony of car horns, chai vendors, and distant temple bells wash over her. She squinted at the unfinished steel skeleton that dominated her view, a colossal structure reaching for the sky – her masterpiece, The Zenith Tower. It was meant to be a beacon of modernity, a symbol of Mumbai's ever-evolving skyline.  But right now, it looked more like a jagged tooth in the cityscape, a testament to ambition and the constant struggle against chaos.

It had been three years, countless revisions, and more than a few sleepless nights since she first envisioned The Zenith Tower. It had become her obsession, consuming every waking thought.
