The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Grace Blackwood's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of "Bargain Buys," the discount store where she spent her days ringing up bargain-priced blenders and discounted dish towels. The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, the usual scent of a place frequented by those who couldn't afford anything better.

It was Friday afternoon, nearing closing time, and Amelia yearned for the sweet relief of being free from this purgatory of perpetual sales and sticky floors. She idly swiped a barcode, her gaze drifting to the clock that ticked relentlessly towards freedom. 


She imagined herself curled up on her worn couch, a good book in hand, the quiet only broken by the gentle hum of the fridge. A fantasy as vibrant as the plastic flowers adorning the cash register, but a fantasy nonetheless.
