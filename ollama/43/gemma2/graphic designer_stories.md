The stale scent of coffee hung heavy in Amelia Grace Carter's cramped apartment, mingling with the faint smell of burnt solder from her latest soldering project – a neon sign for her bedroom window advertising "Amelia's Awesome Art."  She winced at the irony. Her art was anything but awesome right now.  

Her screen glowed with a kaleidoscope of rejected designs: a logo that looked like it belonged on an alien space station, a website layout so cluttered it resembled a child's crayon drawing, and a flyer for a local band whose members seemed less interested in music than in staring intensely at the camera. 

Amelia slumped back in her worn-out chair, her headphones blasting indie rock to drown out the incessant chirping of her phone notifications – each one another reminder that she was struggling to make ends meet as a freelance graphic designer in the heart of bustling San Francisco. The city outside hummed with energy and opportunity, but right now, Amelia felt like she was drowning in the undertow.
