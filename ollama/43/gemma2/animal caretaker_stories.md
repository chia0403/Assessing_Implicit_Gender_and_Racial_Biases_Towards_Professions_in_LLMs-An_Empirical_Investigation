The scent of hay and damp earth clung to Elara Briarsong like a second skin.  She inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar aroma as she walked through the sprawling barn at Oakhaven Sanctuary. Sunlight streamed through cracks in the corrugated tin roof, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Rusted tools hung from makeshift hooks on the walls, and the rhythmic clucking of hens mingled with the mournful moo of a calf separated from its mother. 

Elara ran a hand over the smooth, warm flank of Clover, a gentle Jersey cow who had lost her calf just last week.  She understood Cloverâ€™s grief; Elara had felt it too, losing her own dog, Pip, to illness just a few months ago. 


Oakhaven was more than just a sanctuary for rescued animals - it was Elara's refuge. Here, surrounded by the comforting chaos of barking dogs, purring cats, and clucking chickens, she found solace from the harsh realities of the world outside its weathered gates. But today, something felt different. A chill hung in the air, even within the warmth of the barn.  A shadow seemed to have fallen over Oakhaven, a feeling Elara couldn't quite place but that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end.
