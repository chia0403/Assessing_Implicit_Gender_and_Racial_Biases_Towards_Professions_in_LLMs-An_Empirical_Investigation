The smell of old paper and brewing coffee clung to Eleanor Rose Blackwood like a second skin. Her tiny, book-lined apartment in Edinburgh's Grassmarket was her sanctuary, a haven from the swirling chaos of the city outside. Outside, the cobbled streets pulsed with life - tourists jostling past locals, buskers strumming their guitars, and the ever-present rumble of trams navigating the narrow lanes. But within Eleanor’s walls, time moved at a different pace, dictated by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers on the ancient typewriter that sat perched precariously on a rickety desk.

Eleanor was deep in the throes of writing her third novel, a gothic mystery set against the backdrop of Edinburgh's shadowy history. Her characters, both real and imagined, seemed to breathe life into every corner of her apartment. The scent of lavender from the dried potpourri she used to mask the lingering aroma of pipe tobacco, once favored by her late grandfather, now mingled with the earthy musk of old books. Outside her window, the setting sun cast long shadows across the rooftops, painting the city in hues of burnt orange and deep purple – a perfect reflection of the mood she was trying to capture in her story.
