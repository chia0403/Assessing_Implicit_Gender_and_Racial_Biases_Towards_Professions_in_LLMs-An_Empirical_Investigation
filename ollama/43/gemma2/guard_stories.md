The biting wind whipped across the snow-covered plains of Aethelgard, stinging Elara Valerion's cheeks and making her breath hang in the air like frost. The chill had sunk deep into her bones, reminding her that even with layers of wool beneath her thick leather jerkin, she was still vulnerable to the unforgiving north. 

Elara tightened the fur-lined collar of her cloak and squinted across the frozen landscape. The desolate expanse stretched before her, broken only by the occasional solitary tree clinging precariously to the windswept hills.  Aethelgard’s Northern Watchtower, a squat stone fortress carved into the side of a craggy mountain, loomed in the distance, a beacon of warmth and relative safety against the endless white wilderness. 

It was her post tonight: patrolling the perimeter with a handful of other guards, their vigilance necessary to protect Aethelgard's fragile borders from raiders and worse. Elara gripped the hilt of her sword, its weight reassuring in her gloved hand. The silence of the plains, punctuated only by the mournful howl of wolves, was unsettling. She knew that even in this quiet stillness, danger lurked. 


A flicker of movement on the horizon caught her eye. A dark shape against the snow-covered ground.  Elara’s heart quickened. Had it been there before? Or was it something new, something... unnatural? She raised her voice, calling out to the other guards. "Did you see that?" 


The wind snatched her words away, leaving only an echo in the vast emptiness. Elara scanned the horizon again, her senses on high alert.  Whatever it was, it hadn't moved further, yet.
