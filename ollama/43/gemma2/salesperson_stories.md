The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Sterling, their pale glow bouncing off the slick, mirrored surface of her desk. Outside, the Chicago sun beat down on the towering skyscrapers, casting long shadows that stretched across the bustling Michigan Avenue sidewalk below. But inside the office, it was a different story: air-conditioned stillness, punctuated only by the rhythmic click-clack of keyboards and the occasional muffled phone call. 

Amy leaned back in her chair, her posture mirroring the slump of her sales figures for the month.  The vibrant city outside pulsed with life, yet she felt trapped within the sterile confines of her cubicle, a cog in the vast machine of Apex Industries. Today was supposed to be different. Today was the day she'd finally turn things around.
