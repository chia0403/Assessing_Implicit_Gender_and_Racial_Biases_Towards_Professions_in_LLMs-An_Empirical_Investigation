The aroma of burnt toast clung to the air in the cramped kitchen, mingling with the faint scent of crayons and something vaguely resembling desperation. Amelia "Amy" Harper sighed, carefully peeling the charred edges off the slice she'd salvaged for herself. It wouldn't win any culinary awards, but it would have to do. Five-year-olds were notoriously finicky eaters, and this morning was proving particularly chaotic. 

She glanced out the window of the Sunshine Daycare Center, a cheery yellow house perched precariously on the outskirts of Willow Creek. The sprawling oak tree in the front yard, usually teeming with giggling children swinging from its low branches, stood silent and desolate. It was raining â€“ not just any rain, but a torrential downpour that hammered against the windows like tiny fists. 

Amy took a bite of her toast, grimacing at the bitterness.  The day promised to be long and arduous, a symphony of spilled juice, impromptu tantrums, and the constant hum of anxious energy that only came with being responsible for six rambunctious children on a rainy day. And if she was honest with herself, Amy wasn't quite sure how much longer she could keep up this charade of cheerful competence.
