The hum of the 747’s engines was a constant lullaby to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne. It vibrated through her bones, a comforting tremor that signaled another journey into the unknown.  She loved the sky, the way it swallowed you whole and left you suspended between worlds. As she adjusted the tiny safety blanket on seat 23B, her gaze drifted out the window. Below, a tapestry of clouds stretched endlessly, painted in shades of lavender and grey by the setting sun. It was breathtakingly beautiful, yet Amelia felt a prickle of unease. The air seemed thick with a strange energy, as if the very fabric of the sky was holding its breath.


Amelia wasn’t superstitious, not really, but there was something about this flight that felt different. Perhaps it was the way the passengers were unusually quiet, or the fact that even the usually boisterous children seemed subdued. She chalked it up to turbulence - a storm was brewing ahead, she knew.  It was a typical day for Amelia, just with an extra layer of anticipation hanging in the air. 


The Boeing 747 rumbled through the heavens, its destination: Reykjavik, Iceland.
