The air in Eleanor Evelyn Prescott's office hung thick with the scent of cinnamon and disappointment. Outside, the San Francisco fog swirled like a restless ghost, mirroring the turmoil brewing within her. She stared at the half-eaten kale salad on the table before her, its vibrant green leaves wilting under the dim light filtering through the window. Eleanor, renowned for her holistic approach to nutrition and fiercely dedicated to her clients' well-being, had failed. 

Her latest client, the vivacious social media influencer, Riley Kensington, was back at square one, struggling with her weight loss journey after a disastrous birthday party fueled by sugar-laden cupcakes and bottomless champagne.  The irony wasn't lost on Eleanor â€“ she, who preached the gospel of balanced meals and mindful eating, had seemingly fallen victim to the very demons she fought against. The weight of Riley's disappointment, coupled with her own self-doubt, felt like a leaden cloak settling over her shoulders.
