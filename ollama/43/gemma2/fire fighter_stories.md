The sirens wailed, a mournful symphony echoing through the steel canyons of Chicago.  Rain lashed against the windows of Firehouse 17, blurring the already hazy cityscape into an impressionist painting of grey and black. Inside, Lieutenant Amelia "Amy" Santiago shivered despite the furnace-like heat radiating from the antique radiators. A cup of lukewarm coffee sat untouched on her desk, its steam long since dissipated. Her eyes were glued to the flickering television screen, where a news report depicted plumes of smoke billowing into the bruised sky. 

A fire in the old grain elevator district – that meant trouble.  Amy knew those rickety structures like the back of her hand; labyrinthine interiors filled with dust and tinder-dry grain, prone to sudden collapses. And tonight, the wind was whipping up a nasty storm, adding another layer of danger. She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the inevitable call that would rip her from the mundane routine of paperwork and inspections. It was moments like these that reminded Amy why she'd joined the CFD –  the thrill of adrenaline, the camaraderie forged in the crucible of chaos, the unwavering commitment to saving lives.
