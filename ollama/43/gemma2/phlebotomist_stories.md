The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the blood-soaked bandages neatly stacked on the counter.  Amelia "Amy" Rose adjusted her turquoise scrub top, its cheerful color a stark contrast to the muted blues and grays of the clinic. A faint metallic tang hung in the air, a familiar scent that both grounded and unsettled her. It was 7:30 am, fifteen minutes before opening, and Amy was already prepping for another day as a phlebotomist at Lakeside Medical Center. She had a knack for drawing blood, a calm demeanor that soothed even the most anxious patients, and a genuine empathy that made her seem less like a healthcare worker and more like a confidante. But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an almost tangible tension, a quiet hum that vibrated through the linoleum floor and into Amy's bones.  She couldn’t shake the feeling that something was about to happen, something big, something…unexpected.
