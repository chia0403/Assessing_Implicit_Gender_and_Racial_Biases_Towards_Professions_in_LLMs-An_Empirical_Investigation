The air in Ethelbert “Et” Hawthorne’s office smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation. Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, cast long, striated shadows across his cluttered desk, highlighting the towering stacks of paperwork threatening to engulf him. Et, all 5'8" of him, hunched over a particularly thorny claim – a woman who insisted her prized goldfish had been abducted by aliens, leaving behind only an empty tank and a suspicious residue that smelled vaguely of burnt popcorn. He massaged his temples, the throbbing ache a familiar companion in this line of work.

Et wasn't sure what was worse - dealing with outlandish claims like the "alien goldfish" incident or the endless parade of grief-stricken widows, each with their own sob story about a deceased husband who apparently needed more life insurance than a small country.  It was all just...a lot. 

His office, located in a faded Victorian building on the corner of Elm and Sycamore, was a microcosm of his world – a place where reality blurred with the absurd, and hope often came at a price. The rain outside intensified, drumming a melancholic rhythm against the windowpanes. Et sighed, reached for another cup of lukewarm coffee, and braced himself for whatever absurdity the day would throw at him next.
