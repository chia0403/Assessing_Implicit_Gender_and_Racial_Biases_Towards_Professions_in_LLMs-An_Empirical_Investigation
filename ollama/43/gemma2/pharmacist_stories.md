The bell above the door tinkled its mournful tune as Amelia Beatrice Harper bustled in, her floral-print apron cinched tight against the crisp autumn air.  The scent of cinnamon and clove drifted from the simmering pot of cider on the back counter, mingling with the sterile aroma of antiseptic and cough syrup that permeated every corner of Harper's Apothecary. Outside, a biting wind whipped fallen leaves into miniature tornadoes across the dusty main street of Harmony Ridge, Montana. Amelia shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around her as she scanned the sparse interior. Two customers browsed the shelves stocked with everything from tinctures and salves to hand-stitched herbal pillows, their faces illuminated by the warm glow of Edison bulbs strung across the ceiling. 


Amelia sighed, leaning against the polished mahogany counter that had belonged to her grandfather before him.  Harmony Ridge, once a bustling town brimming with life, now felt as quiet and faded as the antique apothecary jars lining the shelves. Business was slow, and Amelia often wondered if she'd be better off packing it all in and moving back to the city where the opportunities were plentiful. But then she'd glance out the window at the snow-capped peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains framing the town, and a sense of peace would wash over her.  Maybe there was still magic to be found in this sleepy little place, even if it wasnâ€™t always easy to see.
