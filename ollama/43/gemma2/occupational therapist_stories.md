The humid air hung heavy in the treatment room, thick with the scent of antiseptic and lavender oil. Amelia "Amy" Hayes adjusted her glasses, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped from her braid. The late afternoon sun slanted through the window, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  

Amy surveyed the scene before her: an exercise ball with faded pink stripes, a stack of brightly colored blocks, and a whiteboard covered in scribbled progress notes. It wasn't much, but for the children who came here, this room was their world – a space where they learned to overcome their physical challenges and rediscover the joy of movement.

Today, she was meeting with Leo Ramirez, a six-year-old boy with cerebral palsy who had an infectious smile and a stubborn streak as wide as his grin. Amy knew it wouldn't be easy to get him motivated for today's exercises – he'd been particularly resistant to practicing his grip strength lately. But Amy believed in Leo's resilience, and she was determined to make their session both productive and playful.
