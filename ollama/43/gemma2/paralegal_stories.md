Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the small office, blurring the neon sign outside that read "Law Offices of Gregory & Smith" in garish pink and green. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Rose Parker, her brow furrowed in concentration, wrestled with a particularly dense legal document. The paper crinkled beneath her fingertips as she highlighted passages, muttering to herself about "unsubstantiated claims" and "irrelevant hearsay." 

The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly towards 6:00 PM, the unofficial end of Amy's workday. She desperately wanted to be curled up with a good book and a cup of chamomile tea, but Mr. Gregory had thrust this case upon her just hours ago, claiming it was "crucial" for their upcoming trial against a notorious real estate tycoon.  

Amy wasn't sure if she believed him. This firm, with its worn carpets and faded floral wallpaper, felt more like a refuge for forgotten cases than the battleground Mr. Gregory seemed to imagine.  She sighed, pushing back her auburn hair that had escaped its bun, and prepared for another hour of legal wrangling before escaping into the stormy night.
