The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of gleaming instruments. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and peppermint, a familiar comfort that usually eased her anxieties. But today, the usual calm felt distant, replaced by a gnawing unease. A new patient had arrived - Mr. Reginald Blackwood, known in town as 'Reggie the Reaper' for his ruthlessness in business dealings and rumored to have eyes colder than the stainless steel instruments she wielded. 

Amelia adjusted her blue scrubs, smoothing down the crisp fabric. The small dental practice nestled on Elm Street was a world away from Reggie Blackwood's opulent mansion overlooking the city, a stark reminder of the chasm separating their lives. As Mr. Blackwood walked in, his towering frame casting a shadow across the waiting room, Ameliaâ€™s pulse quickened.  The appointment wasn't just about cleaning teeth today; it felt like stepping onto precarious ground.
