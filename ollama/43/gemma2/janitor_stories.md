The humid Florida air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Quincy like a second skin as he wheeled his janitorial cart down the echoing hallway. The scent of stale coffee and forgotten dreams hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint whiff of chlorine from the abandoned swimming pool at the far end. This was The Grand Palms Hotel, once a beacon of luxury, now a decaying monument to faded glamour. 

Bart whistled a mournful tune as he polished the marble floor with practiced ease. He knew every crack and fissure in this aging edifice, every creaking step on the worn carpet, every forgotten corner where secrets whispered in the stillness. The hotel wasn't just his workplace; it was a silent witness to his own life story - a tapestry woven from the threads of missed opportunities and lingering regrets.
