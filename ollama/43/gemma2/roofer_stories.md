The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood’s back like a blacksmith’s hammer, each clang of metal against shingles echoing in the stillness of the morning. Sweat dripped into his eyes, blurring the view of the half-finished Victorian mansion perched precariously on the hill overlooking the town. Below, the sleepy streets of Oakhaven stirred with life – dogs barking, children giggling, Mrs. Henderson across the street already tending her petunias.  

Silas wiped his brow with a dusty rag, grimacing at the grit that scratched against his skin. He loved his job, loved the feeling of wind whipping through his hair as he balanced on the precarious peaks of roofs, loved the intricate dance of nailing shingles, each one a tiny piece in a grand puzzle. But today, even the familiar rhythm couldn't quite soothe the knot of unease tightening in his gut.  


The old woman who owned the house – Mrs. Elmsworth, they called her – had been acting strange lately. Eyes that used to twinkle with mischief now seemed clouded and distant. And the whispered rumors about a family curse swirling through Oakhaven had finally begun to seep into Silas’s dreams, leaving him restless and uncertain.
