The wail of the siren sliced through Amelia "Amy" Rosethorn's carefully curated playlist - the low thrumming of Radiohead morphing into a frantic crescendo as she slammed her foot on the accelerator. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the familiar streets of Willow Creek into an impressionistic painting of neon and grey.  

The dispatch call had been brief, clipped urgency in the voice: "Possible multi-vehicle accident, Main Street and Maple Avenue. One confirmed victim trapped." Amy could feel her heart quickening, a familiar rhythm that kicked in whenever she was hurtling towards someone's worst day. Tonight, it felt particularly insistent, like a drummer pounding on the inside of her ribcage. 

Willow Creek, nestled amongst rolling hills and farmland, usually enjoyed a peaceful tranquility. But tonight, something felt different, charged with a raw energy that crackled in the air.  As Amy navigated the slick streets, her eyes darted to the flashing red and blue lights ahead, their reflections dancing in the puddles that formed miniature mirrors on the asphalt. They were getting closer. She could almost taste the adrenaline already, sharp and metallic on her tongue.

She wasn't sure what she would find at the scene, but one thing was certain: she wouldn't leave until everyone who needed help had received it.
