The air in Elias Thorne's workshop hung thick with sawdust and the scent of cedarwood. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the golden light. It was late afternoon, casting long shadows across the workbench where Elias knelt, his calloused fingers carefully shaping a piece of mahogany. He hummed a low tune under his breath, the melody as familiar to him as the feel of the plane against wood. 

His workshop, nestled at the edge of Whisperwood, wasn't just a place of creation; it was a sanctuary.  Nestled amongst towering pines and whispering oaks, the old cabin had been his grandfatherâ€™s before him, passed down through generations like a cherished heirloom. Now, Elias spent his days here, crafting furniture that was more than just wood and nails - each piece held within it the echoes of stories whispered by the trees, the warmth of hearth fires long gone, and the quiet solace of a life lived in harmony with nature.


But today, something felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the usual calm, a disquiet that pricked at Elias's senses like a splinter. The woods, usually so peaceful, seemed to hold their breath, the wind rustling through the leaves with an uncharacteristic stillness.  And the shadows stretching from the workshop windows seemed to dance with an almost menacing energy.
