The scent of antiseptic and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, mingling with Amelia Juniper’s own brand of lavender aromatherapy oil. The California sun streamed through the high windows of her studio, illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden light. Outside, the San Francisco Bay glistened like a sapphire jewel, but inside, Amelia was focused on the task at hand: guiding Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter with a stubborn knee injury, through his rehabilitation exercises. 

Amelia adjusted the resistance band, her movements precise and practiced. She’d been a physical therapist for ten years now, finding deep satisfaction in helping people reclaim their mobility and independence. There was something magical about witnessing the slow, steady progress – the first tentative steps after a stroke, the gradual return of strength to a weakened limb, the reawakening of joy in movement.  


But today, Mr. Henderson’s usual gruff determination seemed absent. His face held a weariness that went beyond physical pain. Amelia sensed something was amiss.
