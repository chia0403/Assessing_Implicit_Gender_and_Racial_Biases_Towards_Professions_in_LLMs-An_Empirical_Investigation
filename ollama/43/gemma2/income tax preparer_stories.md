The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thistlewood's head, casting a sterile glow over the stacks of papers piled high on her desk. Outside, the January wind howled through the skeletal branches of bare trees, a symphony of winter’s discontent that clashed with the rhythmic tap-tap-tapping of her keyboard. The air in her small office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation – a familiar aroma come tax season. Amelia, an income tax preparer for over fifteen years, wasn't fazed by the chaos. She thrived on it, finding solace in the precision of numbers and the satisfaction of untangling financial messes. 

Her office, nestled in a nondescript strip mall on the outskirts of Scranton, Pennsylvania, was her sanctuary – a haven from the storms both literal and metaphorical that raged outside. Its beige walls were adorned with framed motivational posters (one featuring an image of a mountain climber reaching the summit, captioned "Overcome any obstacle!"), while the lone window offered a depressing view of a cracked asphalt parking lot. 

Today, Amelia was bracing for her most challenging client yet – Mr. Bartholomew “Big Bart” Biggins, a local plumber known for his booming voice and even more boisterous tax returns. He had a reputation for making things complicated, deliberately leaving out vital information or claiming dubious deductions, all while feigning ignorance when questioned.  Amelia sighed, anticipating the inevitable battle of wits that awaited her.
