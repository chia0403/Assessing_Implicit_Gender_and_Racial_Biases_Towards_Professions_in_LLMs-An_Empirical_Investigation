The lobby of The Grand Fontaine shimmered with an air of faded grandeur. Its once-opulent marble floor, now dull from years of polished neglect, reflected the soft light filtering through stained-glass windows depicting scenes of a bygone era - mythical creatures battling, knights jousting, and damsels draped in silk fluttering helplessly in the breeze.  

Eloise Beaumont, her name tag pinned jauntily to her crisp navy uniform, surveyed the scene with practiced indifference. Years spent at The Grand Fontaine had dulled even the most vibrant hues of its decadence. 

A lone bell chimed as a woman, draped in furs and radiating an aura of imperious boredom, swept through the revolving door. Eloise's gaze remained fixed on the worn velvet tapestry depicting a cherub offering a cornucopia, her mind already calculating the woman's potential needs - champagne, a room with a view overlooking the city’s melancholic sprawl, and perhaps, if she was feeling particularly adventurous, a complaint about the temperature of the tea.


The bell chimed again, this time louder, more insistent, pulling Eloise from her reverie. A young man, his eyes wide with a nervous energy that pulsed like a hummingbird's wings, stood framed in the doorway. His face held the faint outline of tears, and he clutched a tattered suitcase to his chest. He looked lost.  

Eloise smiled, a practiced curve of her lips. "Good afternoon," she said, her voice as smooth and welcoming as aged honey. "Welcome to The Grand Fontaine." She knew the story before it was even told. A broken heart, a desperate plea for anonymity, a fleeting hope for something new. 


The young man blinked, startled by her unexpected kindness.  He stammered, “I… I need a room.”
