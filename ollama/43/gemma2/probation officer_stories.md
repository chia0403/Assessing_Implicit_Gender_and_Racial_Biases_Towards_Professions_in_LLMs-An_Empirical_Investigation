The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" diner cast an unsettlingly pink glow across Officer Amelia Katherine Hayes's face as she took her first bite of lukewarm coffee. Outside, the drizzle was relentless, mirroring the oppressive atmosphere inside the small diner. She glanced at the worn photo on the table: a smiling young woman with bright eyes and auburn hair that flowed down her back like a waterfall. Her daughter, Lily.  Amelia hadn't seen her smile in months. 

The diner, perched precariously on the edge of District 7 – notorious for its high crime rate and even higher unemployment – was Amelia's usual haunt. It wasn’t glamorous, but it served decent coffee and offered a sense of anonymity that she desperately craved.  A sense of normalcy, something her job as a probation officer had cruelly stripped away. 


Amelia took another sip of the bitter brew, the metallic tang reminding her of the sting in the air – the ever-present tension in this part of town. Today's meeting was with Victor "Vic" Malone, a young man fresh out of juvie and already on thin ice with the law. Amelia knew from his file that Vic was intelligent but volatile, a ticking time bomb desperate for an outlet. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. It wasn't Vic. A shiver ran down Amelia's spine as she watched a figure step in, cloaked in shadows and radiating an aura of danger. This city had a way of making even the ordinary feel sinister. This man, though, felt different. He was trouble, and he was looking for her.
