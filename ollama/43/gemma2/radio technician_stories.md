The flickering neon sign outside "Whistle & Wire" cast an oily green light across Amelia "Amy" Rosethorn's grease-stained overalls.  Rain lashed against the windows, a relentless torrent that mirrored the storm brewing inside her. 

The cramped repair shop was filled with the scent of ozone and burnt solder, punctuated by the rhythmic ticking of antique clocks awaiting their resurrection. A lone bulb illuminated a workbench cluttered with transistors, capacitors, and half-assembled radios, each one a symphony of wires waiting to be coaxed into song. Amy, her brow furrowed in concentration, fiddled with the delicate circuitry of an old Zenith console, its once vibrant mahogany finish now dulled by years of neglect.

Amelia was a master of this forgotten world, a weaver of sonic tapestries who could breathe life back into lifeless machines. But tonight, even she felt powerless against the discordant symphony raging within her own heart. Her mentor and employer, Old Man Finnigan, had passed away unexpectedly that morning, leaving Amy adrift in a sea of grief and uncertainty.  


Whistle & Wire wasn't just a shop; it was a legacy, a haven for forgotten frequencies and whispered stories carried on the airwaves. But now, with Finnigan gone, the silence felt deafening.
