The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. Sunlight, fractured by the towering Douglas firs, dappled the forest floor where Silas Bartholomew "Si" Clearwater knelt, his calloused hands tracing the intricate grain of a fallen giant.  His worn leather work gloves gripped the rough bark, feeling for imperfections, listening to the faint creaking of branches overhead. 

Si was a man as weathered as the woods he called home. His face, etched with lines from years spent under the sun and rain, held a stoicism born of solitude and respect for the land. He wasn't just a logger; he was a storyteller of trees, a weaver of their fates into his own. Each fallen giant held a whispered history, a testament to the relentless march of time and the silent symphony of life in the forest. Today, this particular behemoth, its roots reaching deep into the earth like gnarled fingers, promised a story unlike any Si had heard before.  


The setting: The Pacific Northwest, nestled amongst the ancient forests of Oregon.
