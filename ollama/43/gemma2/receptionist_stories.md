The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Finch’s head, their pale glow doing little to illuminate the dust motes dancing in the stale air of Dr. Albright's office.  Eleanor sighed, her gaze drifting across the peeling wallpaper and threadbare armchair in the waiting room. Outside, the California sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of the parking lot, a stark contrast to the stifling heat trapped within these walls. 

The clock ticked loudly, each second an eternity in this desolate purgatory.  Eleanor tapped her manicured nails against the worn countertop, willing herself to appear busy, interested even. But the monotony was crushing. It had been another quiet Tuesday morning at Dr. Albright’s practice, and she yearned for something, anything, to break the silence. 


She glanced down at her clipboard, noting the next appointment: Mr. Henry Peabody, "regarding anxieties."  Eleanor smiled faintly. At least he wouldn't be boring.
