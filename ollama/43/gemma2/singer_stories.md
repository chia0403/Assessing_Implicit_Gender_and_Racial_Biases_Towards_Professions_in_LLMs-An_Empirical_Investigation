The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale beer, a symphony of its own in the dimly lit backroom of The Dusty Note. Neon signs cast an anemic glow on the sticky floor, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the humid air.  Amelia Rose Hawthorne perched on a battered stool, her guitar resting on her lap like a trusted confidant. She tapped her foot to the rhythm of a bluesy song wailing from the jukebox, her fingers restless over the worn strings. Amelia was waiting for her chance, a chance to prove that beneath the faded denim jacket and dusty boots, there was a voice that could captivate a room.  

Tonight, she felt it. A fire in her belly, a tremor in her fingertips, a certainty that tonight was different. Tonight, the world would hear Amelia Rose Hawthorne.
