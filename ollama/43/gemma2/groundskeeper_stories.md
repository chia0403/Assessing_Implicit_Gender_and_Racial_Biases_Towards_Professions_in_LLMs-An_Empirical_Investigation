The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Quillfeather’s boots like damp wool as he pushed his ancient wheelbarrow across the dew-laden lawns of Oakhaven Manor. Sunbeams, hesitant at first, struggled through the mist, painting long stripes of gold on the emerald expanse. Oakhaven, once a grand estate bustling with life, now felt as hushed and melancholy as an abandoned cathedral. 

Bartholomew, his weathered hands calloused from years of coaxing life from the soil, paused to inspect a patch of newly sprouted daffodils. Their golden heads, tipped with dew, promised a brighter future for this forgotten corner of the world. He sighed, knowing that even these resilient blooms couldn't quite dispel the lingering chill of neglect that permeated every cobblestone path and overgrown garden bed.  He was Oakhaven’s last remaining caretaker, a solitary sentinel guarding the memories of a bygone era.
