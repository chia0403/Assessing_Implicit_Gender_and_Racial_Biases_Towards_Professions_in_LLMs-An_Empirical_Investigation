The aroma of cured ham and fresh rosemary hung thick in the air, battling with the metallic tang of blood that clung to everything in Bartholomew "Barty" Cleaver's shop. Outside, the grey December sky bled into the cobbled streets of Grimsborough, mirroring the gloom settling over Barty's heart. A single flickering gaslight cast long, skeletal shadows across the worn butcher block and rows of glistening carcasses. 

Grimsborough was a town steeped in tradition, where generations had walked these same cobblestones, their footsteps echoing through centuries. But lately, even the familiar rhythm of life felt off-key. The coal mines, Grimsborough's lifeblood, were struggling, and whispers of unemployment and desperation drifted through the narrow alleys like the chill wind whistling down from the distant fells.  

Barty leaned against his counter, a worn cleaver resting on his calloused hand. He was more than just a butcher; he was a confidante, a dispenser of practical advice and gruff comfort to the town's inhabitants. Today, though, even his usual stoicism felt strained. 


The chime above the door tinkled, breaking the silence. A woman stood on the threshold, her face etched with worry lines deeper than any cut he had ever made. He knew instantly that this was no ordinary customer seeking a pound of sausages or a roast for Sunday dinner.  This was trouble.
