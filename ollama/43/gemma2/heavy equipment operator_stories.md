The sun beat down on Elias “Big Eli” Hawthorne’s neck like a blacksmith’s hammer. Sweat beaded on his forehead, tracing paths through the dust that caked his face and forearms. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, the movement leaving a streak of grime across his weathered skin. The air hung thick and heavy over the construction site, the only sounds the rhythmic clang of steel against steel and the guttural growl of the diesel engine under Eli’s command. Around him, a colossal steel skeleton rose from the earth – beams like giant bones, plates like armor plating.

Eli was at the heart of it all, his massive yellow bulldozer a tireless titan carving paths through the rubble and leveling ground for the next layer of steel. He'd been operating heavy equipment since he was sixteen, working alongside his father in their family’s construction business. Now, years later, he ran the site himself, his calloused hands moving with a practiced grace that belied the immense power he wielded.  

Today, however, wasn't just another day on the job. Today, Eli had a problem. A big one. The blueprints for the building had changed again – a last-minute alteration that threw his carefully laid plans into disarray. And time, as always, was of the essence. 


The setting: A bustling construction site in a rapidly developing city. Steel and concrete are everywhere, cranes reach towards the clouds, and the air vibrates with the cacophony of machinery.
