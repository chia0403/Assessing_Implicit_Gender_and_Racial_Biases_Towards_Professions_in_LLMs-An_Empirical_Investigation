The sun, a molten fist punching through the smog-choked sky, beat down on Silas "Brick"  Briggs' neck as he swung his sledgehammer with practiced ease. Sparks showered from the crumbling concrete as the head connected, sending a tremor up Brick's arm and a satisfying echo across the desolate construction site. Around him, the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper clawed at the polluted sky, steel beams reaching like rusted fingers towards a heaven that seemed to have long forgotten this part of the city. The air vibrated with the cacophony of jackhammers, welding torches, and shouts in languages Brick barely understood â€“ a symphony of progress amidst the grime and grit.

Brick wiped his brow, leaving a smear of sweat and grime across his forehead, then adjusted the faded bandana tied around his head. He squinted at the blueprints clutched in his calloused hand, trying to decipher the next step in this concrete puzzle.  His eyes, hardened by years under the unforgiving sun, scanned the blueprint again, searching for the familiar symbol that would mark the beginning of his most challenging task yet: laying the foundation for the penthouse suite, a gilded cage perched at the apex of this city's ambition.
