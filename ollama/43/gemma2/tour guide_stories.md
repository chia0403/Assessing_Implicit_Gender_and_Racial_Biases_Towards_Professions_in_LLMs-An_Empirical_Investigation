The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine as Esme Amelia Blackwood adjusted her straw hat. Sweat trickled down her temple despite the shade offered by the ancient banyan tree. Tourists, their faces flushed with a mixture of heat and excitement, huddled around her like sunflowers seeking the sun.

"Welcome, everyone," Esme announced, her voice ringing with practiced enthusiasm. "To the legendary ruins of Avani!" 

A collective gasp rippled through the crowd as they gazed upon the sprawling temple complex bathed in the golden glow of the setting sun. Jagged stones clawed at the sky, moss clinging to their surfaces like emerald veins. Vines, thick as a man's arm, snaked between crumbling pillars, hinting at the jungle's relentless claim on this once-great city.

Esme adjusted her leather satchel, feeling the familiar weight of her guidebook and compass against her hip. This was her domain, this whispering labyrinth of history and mystery. She loved sharing its secrets with her visitors, weaving tales of forgotten gods and lost civilizations, bringing the past to life in the heart of the steaming, vibrant jungle.

But today, Esme couldn't shake a feeling of unease. A shiver ran down her spine, seemingly unrelated to the muggy air. The tourists seemed restless, their chatter subdued, as if sensing something amiss. Perhaps it was the way the shadows stretched longer than usual, or the unnatural stillness of the jungle.

Whatever it was, Esme knew this tour would be anything but ordinary.
