The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket woven with whispers of forgotten stories. Eleanor Amelia Thistlewick, Head Librarian of the Blackwood Manor Library, adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the cavernous hall. Sunlight streamed through stained glass windows, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden rays. She ran a fingertip along the spine of a leather-bound volume titled "Forgotten Folklore of the Fae," its pages whispering promises of hidden magic. 

Blackwood Manor itself stood on the windswept cliffs overlooking the churning sea, a gothic masterpiece of gargoyles and turrets, shrouded in an air of perpetual twilight. Its history was as rich and intricate as the tapestries adorning the library walls, woven with tales of love, loss, and secrets whispered through generations.  Eleanor, a woman of quiet strength and boundless curiosity, had dedicated her life to preserving these stories, each book a portal to another world, waiting to be explored. 


But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced across Eleanor's skin, a disharmony in the usually comforting hum of the library. It began as a faint whisper, like the rustle of unseen wings, then intensified into a low murmur that seemed to emanate from the very walls themselves.  She straightened, her gaze sweeping over the familiar shelves, searching for the source of this unsettling disturbance. A single book, newly arrived and uncatalogued, lay on a pedestal in the center of the room. Its cover was blank, smooth as polished stone, yet it pulsed with an unseen energy that drew Eleanor's eyes like a moth to a flame.
