The air hung thick with the scent of acetone and jasmine. A faint hum vibrated from the neon sign outside, casting a sickly pink glow across Eloise Beatrice Beaumont's meticulously organized workspace. She adjusted her tortoiseshell spectacles, squinting at the intricate swirl of a French manicure she was perfecting on Mrs. Periwinkle, a woman whose life seemed as perfectly manicured as her nails.
