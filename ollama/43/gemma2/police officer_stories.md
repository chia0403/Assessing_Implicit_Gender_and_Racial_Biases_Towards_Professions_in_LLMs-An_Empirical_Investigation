The humid Miami air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and salt, clinging to Detective Isabella Flores like a second skin. Rain hammered on the corrugated metal roof of the abandoned warehouse, each drop exploding in a tiny burst of sound that echoed through the cavernous space. Flickering neon signs cast grotesque shadows on the dust-caked floor, illuminating scattered debris: broken furniture, torn posters, and empty liquor bottles. 

Isabella, her dark hair pulled back into a tight braid, navigated the rubble cautiously, her hand hovering near the .45 strapped to her hip. The warehouse's only light source was a single bare bulb dangling precariously from the ceiling, casting long, distorted shapes that danced with every gust of wind whistling through cracks in the walls. 


A low growl cut through the storm's roar. Isabella froze, her senses on high alert. It wasn't the sound of feral animals; this was something more primal, a guttural rumble that vibrated deep within her chest. She raised her weapon, her heart pounding against her ribs like a trapped bird.

"Hello?" she called out, her voice barely audible above the wind and rain. "Police! Show yourself!" 


The growl rumbled again, closer this time. Isabella knew whatever was in this warehouse wasn't human. And it wasn't friendly.
