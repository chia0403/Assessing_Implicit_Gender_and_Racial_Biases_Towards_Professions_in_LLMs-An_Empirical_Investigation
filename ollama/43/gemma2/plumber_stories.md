The incessant drip-drip-drip from Mrs. Periwinkle's antique clawfoot tub was driving Alistair Percival Plumbing mad. Not just mad, actually. It was gnawing at his sanity like a particularly persistent rat in the walls of a Victorian house. And Alistair, despite his name implying an air of distinguished Britishness, was decidedly not feeling distinguished today. He was covered in grime, smelling faintly of sulfur and desperation, and wishing he'd chosen law school instead.

He squinted at the dripping faucet, its brass gleaming mockingly under the dim light of Mrs. Periwinkle's cavernous bathroom. It wasn't just a leaky faucet; it was a symphony of dribbles and sighs, each drop echoing in the vast silence of the room.  The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender bath salts and something else, something vaguely metallic that made Alistair wrinkle his nose. This bathroom, despite its opulence, felt like it was holding its breath, waiting for something to give way.

Outside, London was a tapestry of grey skies and hurried footsteps. The rain had started again, drumming on the roof and adding another layer of melancholy to the symphony of dripping water that surrounded Alistair. But inside Mrs. Periwinkle's house, time seemed to stand still, suspended in the humid air and punctuated by the relentless drip-drip-drip.  


Alistair sighed, wiping his brow with a grimy handkerchief. This was going to be a long day.
