The wind whipped across Silas Blackwood's weathered face, carrying with it the scent of rain and freshly tilled earth.  Dawn was breaking over the rolling hills of his family farm, casting long shadows from the gnarled branches of ancient oak trees that lined the property. The air was crisp, tinged with a hint of woodsmoke from the chimney of his farmhouse, where Silas' wife, Eleanor, would already be stirring, preparing breakfast for their two young sons.

Silas tugged at his worn overalls and surveyed his land – acres upon acres of barley fields stretching as far as the eye could see, shimmering golden under the nascent sunlight. This year’s harvest promised to be bountiful, thanks to the unusually wet spring followed by weeks of sunshine. A sense of contentment settled over him; he was a man deeply rooted in the rhythm of the earth, finding solace and purpose in the cycle of sowing and reaping.

But today, a disquiet lingered beneath Silas' usual serenity.  News had spread through the village like wildfire – rumors of strange lights in the sky, whispers of unsettling occurrences in the nearby woods. The villagers were fearful, their faces etched with worry as they gathered at the market square, exchanging anxious glances and hushed tales. 


Silas, a man of logic and reason, dismissed it as superstitious nonsense. Yet, he couldn't shake off a nagging feeling of unease. Something was amiss in his usually peaceful world.
