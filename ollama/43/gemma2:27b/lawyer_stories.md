Rain hammered against the frosted glass windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of the "Liberty Diner" sign across the street. Eleanor Vance, her sharp cheekbones accentuated by the dim light in her office, stared out at the storm with a weary sigh. The worn leather of her armchair creaked sympathetically as she shifted, the weight of another long day pressing down on her shoulders. Legal battles were rarely won easily, and this one, defending an immigrant family facing deportation, felt particularly heavy.

Eleanor's office, nestled in a quiet corner of Brooklyn, reflected her personality: organized chaos. Stacks of legal tomes threatened to topple over beside overflowing file folders, while a half-eaten bowl of ramen noodles sat precariously on the edge of her desk. A worn-out Persian rug, inherited from her grandmother, attempted to bring warmth to the otherwise sterile space.  But Eleanor's gaze remained fixed on the storm, mirroring the tumult brewing within her own heart.

The phone buzzed, startling her out of her reverie. The caller ID flashed "Maria Rodriguez." A pang of guilt shot through Eleanor. She hadn't called Maria back after their last meeting, hesitant to deliver news she knew wouldn't be welcome.
