The scent of damp earth and overgrown lavender hung heavy in the air as Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood knelt beside a rogue patch of dandelions. He carefully coaxed them from the ground with his trowel, their cheerful yellow faces wilting under the afternoon sun.  

Greenwich Manor was a sprawling estate perched on the edge of a windswept moor. Ivy clawed at its crumbling stone walls, and the once-proud rose garden now resembled a forgotten labyrinth choked with weeds. Teddy, with his calloused hands and perpetually dirt-stained overalls, was the sole guardian of this neglected beauty. For years he'd tended to the manor's overgrown grounds, whispering secrets to the ancient oaks and coaxing life back into withered blooms.  He knew every creak of the iron gates, every rustle in the willow tree by the pond. Yet, despite his intimacy with the land, a strange unease had settled upon him recently.

The whispers on the wind seemed louder now, carrying tales of forgotten footsteps and unseen eyes. And then there was the letter he'd found tucked beneath a loose brick in the garden wall â€“ a faded envelope addressed to "the Keeper" with no sender's name. Its contents were cryptic, hinting at a hidden truth buried deep within the manor's secrets.
