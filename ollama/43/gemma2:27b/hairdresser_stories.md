The humid air hung heavy in the cramped salon, thick with the scent of hairspray, bleach, and something vaguely floral from Mrs. Henderson's perpetually overdone perfume. Outside, a summer storm was brewing, the sky turning a bruised purple as fat raindrops splattered against the windowpane. Evelyn Pearl "Eve" Cartwright sighed, her reflection in the chipped mirror shimmering back at her with exhaustion. 

Her fingers, calloused and stained with dye, danced nervously through the tangled strands of Mrs. O'Malley's hair. Eve was good at her job, a magician with scissors and color, able to transform the most disastrous mop into something vaguely presentable. But today, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was trapped in a cycle, snipping away at life one lock at a time. 

The bell above the door chimed, jolting Eve out of her reverie. A figure stood silhouetted against the storm-lashed street, rain dripping from their dark fedora. This wasn't a regular customer. This was someone new, someone different, someone who might just shake up Eve's stagnant world.
