The midday sun beat down on Silas "Sil" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy cityscape stretching before him. He adjusted his safety goggles, the worn plastic scratching against his brow, and surveyed the crumbling asphalt shingles beneath his calloused fingers. Three more rows to go, he thought grimly, then lunch.

Sil was perched atop a three-story brownstone in Brooklyn's Prospect Heights neighborhood. The air thrummed with the usual symphony of city life: distant sirens, honking taxis, the rhythmic clatter of a construction site down the street. But up here, silhouetted against the azure sky, it felt like he existed in a bubble, detached from the frenetic energy pulsing below.

He preferred it this way. The solitude, the rhythmic work, the tangible satisfaction of transforming a dilapidated roof into something sturdy and new â€“ it was his sanctuary.

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Sil's spine. He couldn't pinpoint it, just a sense that he was being watched. As he reached for another shingle, his gaze snagged on a glint of sunlight reflecting off something in the alley across the street.
