The incessant chirping of cicadas was the only soundtrack to Dr. Evelyn Albright's mounting anxiety.  Heat shimmered off the asphalt driveway, distorting the already faded paint of her childhood home. It had been fifteen years since she'd last stood on this porch, fifteen years since she'd felt the rough texture of the peeling banister beneath her hand. Back then, it had symbolized freedom - a gateway to escape the suffocating small-town life. Now, it represented a homecoming tinged with dread.

Evelyn, her crisp white blouse already clinging uncomfortably to her back in the sweltering July air, straightened the collar and took a deep breath. Inside, her mother's frail form awaited, a woman ravaged by grief and dementia. Evelyn had returned to help care for her, a daunting task that felt both obligatory and terrifyingly overwhelming. The house itself seemed to be holding its breath, its windows dark and lifeless like vacant eyes.

This was no ordinary case for Dr. Albright. This wasn't a patient on her couch, spilling their anxieties in measured tones. This was family, a tangled web of memories and unspoken truths. And Evelyn, the detached observer trained to analyze and dissect human behavior, suddenly found herself at the epicenter of her own personal storm.
