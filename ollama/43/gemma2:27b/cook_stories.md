The air in La Petite Boulangerie hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and thyme. Sunlight, filtered through gauzy curtains the colour of pale saffron, dusted the flour-dusted countertops and glinted off the copper pots hanging above Elodie Beaumont's head. Elodie, her auburn braids escaping their tie as she kneaded dough with rhythmic force, was a woman sculpted by her craft. Her strong forearms were crisscrossed with faded burns, souvenirs from countless kitchen mishaps, while her hands, calloused yet gentle, moved with the practiced grace of a concert pianist.

Today was market day in the sleepy French village of Saint-Germain-des-Bois, and Elodie was preparing for the onslaught. Baskets overflowed with plump cherries and glistening raspberries, their sweetness mingling with the earthy aroma of fresh thyme and rosemary plucked from her own herb garden. But amidst the cheerful bustle, a shadow lingered over Elodie's heart. News had arrived that morning â€“ Monsieur Dubois, the village elder and her most loyal customer, was ailing. His absence from the market felt like a missing piece in the symphony of Saint-Germain, and Elodie knew she needed to bake something special, something that would carry her well wishes across the miles.
