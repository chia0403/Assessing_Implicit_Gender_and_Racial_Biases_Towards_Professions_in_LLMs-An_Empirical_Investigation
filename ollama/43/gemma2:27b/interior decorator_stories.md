Rain lashed against the arched windows of Esmeralda "Esme" Thorne's Victorian townhouse, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  She glared at the crumpled mood board scattered across her antique mahogany table - a testament to her latest client's indecisiveness. Mrs. Bellingham wanted a "zen retreat" but couldn't agree on whether bamboo or bougainvillea was more serene. Esme sighed, running a hand through her fiery red curls. This wasn't the artistic freedom she craved when she'd opened "Thorne & Co." Interior Design. 

Esme glanced at the storm raging outside, the flickering gaslight casting long shadows across the room. The scent of lavender from a freshly-cut bouquet on her desk did little to soothe her frustration. Outside, London pulsed with life despite the downpour, but Esme felt utterly trapped within the confines of her own creative block. She needed inspiration, something fresh and unexpected.
