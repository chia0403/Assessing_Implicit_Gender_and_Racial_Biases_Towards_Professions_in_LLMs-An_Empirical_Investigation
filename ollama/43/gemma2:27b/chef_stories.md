Rain lashed against the grimy windows of La Petite Cocotte, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into an indistinct smudge. Inside, Elias Moreau, his toque askew and flour dusting his apron like freshly fallen snow, wrestled with a recalcitrant souffl√©. The pungent aroma of caramelized onions battled with the sweet scent of roasting chicken for dominance in the air. 

Elias was renowned in the cobblestone alleys of Montmartre for his culinary artistry, but tonight, even his practiced hands felt clumsy. He blamed the storm, its relentless drumming mirroring the anxiety thrumming in his chest. A prestigious food critic, Madame Dubois, known for her scathing reviews and icy demeanor, was scheduled to dine at La Petite Cocotte that very night. Elias's dream of finally earning a coveted Michelin star rested on this one review.
