Flames licked hungrily at the edges of the broken glass, casting dancing shadows across the faces of the firefighters gathered below.

His heart thumped against his ribs, adrenaline surging through him as always when the alarm sounded.  Eli lived for these moments, the raw energy, the delicate balance between danger and control. He wouldn't have it any other way.


This was his city, his people. And he, along with his team, would do everything in their power to save them.
