Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his tapping fingers. Stacks of invoices towered precariously on his desk, illuminated by the sickly yellow glow of an overhead fluorescent bulb. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Bart, a man whose soul seemed perpetually trapped between debit and credit columns, stared at a particularly infuriating spreadsheet. The numbers danced before his weary eyes, refusing to coalesce into a coherent whole.

He was on deadline. A crucial audit for the prestigious Blackwood Shipping Company was due tomorrow morning, and Bart was drowning in a sea of discrepancies. This wasn't just another tedious accounting job; this was his chance to prove himself after years of being relegated to the backwater of petty cash reconciliations. But with each passing minute, the weight of expectation threatened to crush him.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled him from his numerical nightmare. It swung open to reveal Beatrice "Bea" Mallory, Bart's boisterous and ever-optimistic colleague.  Her red curls were escaping their usual bun, and her emerald eyes sparkled with mischief.
