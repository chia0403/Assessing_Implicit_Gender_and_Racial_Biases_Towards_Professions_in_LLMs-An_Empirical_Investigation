The air in the cramped workshop was thick with the smell of solder and ozone, a familiar scent to Elias Finnigan, whose nimble fingers danced across the circuit board before him.  His brow furrowed in concentration as he meticulously replaced a faulty capacitor on an ancient Zenith Transoceanic radio. Sunlight, filtered through the dusty windowpane, cast long shadows across the cluttered workbench, illuminating a jumble of vacuum tubes, resistors, and tangled wires. Outside, the rhythmic chugging of a passing steam locomotive punctuated the quiet hum emanating from Elias's makeshift test rig. 

Elias lived in a world where technology was both revered and feared. His small town of Willow Creek, nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains, had always been hesitant to embrace the march of progress. Most folks were content with their wood-burning stoves and hand-cranked telephones. But Elias, with his boundless curiosity and love for all things electrical, saw magic in the whispers carried on radio waves.

Today, however, was different. A frantic knocking at the workshop door broke Elias's focus, bringing a chill down his spine. He knew that knock. It belonged to Sheriff Brody, and whenever the lawman paid him a visit, it usually meant trouble was brewing in Willow Creek.
