Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Elara Thorne's tiny attic apartment, each drop a miniature hammer blow echoing through the cramped space. The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and old code – Elara's signature perfume.  She sat hunched over her desk, bathed in the sickly green glow emanating from her triple monitors. Lines of code scrolled endlessly across the screens, punctuated by the insistent click-clack of her keyboard. Outside, Tokyo pulsed with neon life, oblivious to the digital battle raging within Elara's world.

Elara wasn't just any programmer; she was a ghostwalker, a digital necromancer who breathed life into discarded code and resurrected forgotten algorithms. Her latest project: deciphering the enigmatic source code of an ancient AI rumored to possess sentience – a relic from a bygone era when technology dreamed of transcendence.
