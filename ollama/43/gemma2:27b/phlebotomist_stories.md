The fluorescent lights hummed above Elsie Mae Cartwright's head, casting an almost sickly yellow glow over the sterile white walls of St. Jude's Hospital lab. The air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and something faintly metallic - a constant reminder of the lifeblood that flowed through her hands every day. 

Elsie Mae prided herself on being quick and efficient, a trait honed by years of drawing blood from nervous patients, wriggling toddlers, and even the occasional grumpy octogenarian. Today was no different. She expertly maneuvered a needle into Mrs. Henderson's arm, watching the crimson tide flow smoothly into the vial. A practiced smile curved Elsie Mae's lips as she reassured the elderly woman, her voice calm and soothing. 


But today, something felt off. A tingling unease crept up Elsie Mae's spine as she moved to the next patient â€“ a young man with haunted eyes and a tremor in his hands. The vial filled quickly, alarmingly so, and Elsie Mae noticed an unsettling dark purple tinge to the blood instead of its usual bright scarlet. Her heart pounded against her ribs as the young man suddenly grabbed her wrist, his voice raspy and urgent.

"You need to see this," he whispered, his eyes wide with fear. "It's not right."
