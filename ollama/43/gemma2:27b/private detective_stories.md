Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane, mimicking the incessant drumming in Esmeralda "Esme" Vargas's skull. The flickering neon sign outside cast sickly green stripes across her cluttered desk, illuminating a half-eaten sandwich and a stack of case files teetering precariously. Esme took a long drag from her cigarette, the acrid smoke momentarily dulling the throbbing behind her eyes.

She was nestled in a cramped office above a dingy Chinese takeout joint in the heart of Chinatown, San Francisco. The air hung heavy with the mingled scents of garlic, sesame oil, and cheap whiskey. A lone ceiling fan whirred ineffectually against the stifling heat, stirring up dust motes that danced in the sickly green light. Esme's office wasn't much to look at, but it was hers - a haven from the relentless chaos of the city below.

Just as she reached for the phone to call it a night, the door creaked open, admitting a gust of cold air and a figure shrouded in shadows.  Esme squinted, her hand instinctively hovering over the revolver tucked beneath her desk. "Can I help you?" she rasped, her voice rough from too much whiskey and not enough sleep.
