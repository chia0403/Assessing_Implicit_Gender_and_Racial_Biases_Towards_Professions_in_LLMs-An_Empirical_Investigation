Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of The Rusty Mug, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of light from the neon sign flickering just outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, fried onions, and desperation. Behind the mahogany bar, Alistair "Al" Finch wiped down a glass with a practiced hand, his eyes darting across the sparse crowd.

There was Millie, hunched over a half-empty bottle of whiskey, muttering to herself about the price of eggs these days. Two burly dockworkers argued loudly in the corner booth, their words slurring into unintelligible grunts punctuated by slamming fists on the table. And then there was the stranger, seated alone at the far end of the bar. He wore a long, dark coat that concealed most of his features, a fedora casting a shadow over his face. He hadn't touched his drink – a glass of amber liquid Al recognized as top-shelf scotch – since he sat down an hour ago. His gaze was fixed on something unseen, somewhere beyond the rain-streaked windowpane.

Something about him set Al on edge. It wasn't just the stranger's stillness, or the air of barely contained power that seemed to emanate from him like heat waves. It was his eyes – two sharp, piercing orbs that flickered with an unsettling intelligence.
