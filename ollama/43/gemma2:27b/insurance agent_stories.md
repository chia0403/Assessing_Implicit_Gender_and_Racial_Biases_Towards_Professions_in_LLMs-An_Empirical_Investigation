The flickering neon sign outside cast an unsettling green glow across Theodore "Teddy" Finch's face as he squinted at the paperwork in his hands. Rain lashed against the windows of his office, a cramped space above a laundromat on Elm Street. The air hung heavy with the scent of soap and mildew, a peculiar blend Teddy had grown accustomed to over the past ten years. Tonight, however, the smell felt oppressive, mirroring the knot of anxiety tightening in his gut.

His client, Mrs. Adelaide Hawthorne, sat opposite him, her wrinkled face etched with worry. She clutched a faded photograph – a younger version of herself beaming alongside a handsome man with salt-and-pepper hair. 


"He always said he wanted to sail around the world," she murmured, her voice brittle like dry leaves. "Said life insurance was for 'foolish landlubbers'. He never thought..." Her voice trailed off, and Teddy knew better than to pry further.  He'd seen enough grief in his time to understand that some wounds were too fresh to be touched.

The photograph was a stark reminder of the delicate dance Teddy performed daily – balancing the realities of life and death with the cold calculations of risk and reward. He wasn't just selling insurance; he was peddling peace of mind, a fleeting illusion in a world where anything could happen.
