Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the drafter's hut, a relentless drumming that mirrored Eleanor Hawthorne's headache. The smell of damp earth and woodsmoke hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of ink and graphite from her worktable. Outside, the wind howled through the skeletal trees lining the dusty path leading to the sprawling ironworks. 

Eleanor gripped her pencil tighter, its worn wood slick against her clammy fingers. The blueprints spread before her â€“ a labyrinthine network of pipes, gears, and furnaces for the new smelting mill - swam in a blur. This wasn't just any commission. It was Mr. Blackwood's pet project, the one he swore would revolutionize iron production. And Eleanor, as the only drafter within a hundred miles who understood his cryptic sketches, was tasked with translating his vision into reality.

The weight of responsibility pressed down on her. Failure wasn't an option. Not when it meant jeopardizing Mr. Blackwood's dreams and potentially losing her own precarious livelihood.
