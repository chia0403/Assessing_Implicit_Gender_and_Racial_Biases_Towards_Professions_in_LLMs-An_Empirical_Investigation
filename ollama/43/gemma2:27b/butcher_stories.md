The air in Aloysius "Al" Grimshaw's shop hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary. It clung to his apron, stained crimson not from blood but from years of marinades and spice rubs. Outside, the cobbled street of Elmhaven pulsed with morning market bustle. But Al preferred the quiet symphony of cleavers on bone, the rhythmic thump of a mallet tenderizing beef, the hiss of lard sizzling in the cast iron pan by the window.

Today, however, the usual rhythm was disrupted. A letter lay folded upon the butcher block, its crisp cream paper jarring against the worn wood. Al's calloused thumb traced the embossed seal - the royal crest, a gilded lion rampant on a field of azure. His heart, usually as steady as the beat of his cleaver, fluttered with unease. He knew the King's summons rarely brought good tidings for humble butchers like himself.
