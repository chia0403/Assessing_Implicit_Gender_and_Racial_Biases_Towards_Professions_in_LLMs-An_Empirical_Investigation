Rain hammered against the warped glass panes of Beatrice "Bea" Abernathy's office window, blurring the neon glow of the pawn shop sign across the street. The rhythmic drumming was punctuated by the occasional groan of the ancient building settling, a sound Bea had come to associate with her own weary bones. Stacks of invoices towered precariously on her desk, each one representing another struggling business in this forgotten corner of downtown.

Bea's fingers, gnarled and stained with ink, flew across the keys of her battered typewriter. Numbers danced before her eyes â€“ debits, credits, the constant ebb and flow of money that dictated the lives of these small-time merchants. Despite the dreary surroundings and the endless spreadsheets, Bea found a peculiar solace in her work. She was a guardian of sorts, a silent protector against financial ruin for those who entrusted their livelihoods to her meticulous care.
