Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Elara Rosalind Vance. A seasoned RN with auburn hair perpetually pulled back in a practical bun, Elara stared at the chart in her hand, her brow furrowed.

Outside, the storm raged on, a fitting backdrop for the internal whirlwind threatening to consume her.  Should she follow protocol and administer the risky treatment? Or should she trust her gut, which whispered of unknown consequences and ethical quandaries? The decision weighed heavy in her chest, each beat echoing the thunder rumbling across the stormy sky.
