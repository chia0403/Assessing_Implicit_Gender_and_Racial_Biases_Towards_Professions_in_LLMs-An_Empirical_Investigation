Rain lashed against the windows of The Critter Clinic, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an anemic smear.  Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne sighed, her breath fogging the already steamed glass pane separating her from the waiting room. She loved animals with all her heart, but she was beginning to regret opening her clinic in Whispering Pines, a town seemingly populated entirely by creatures with ailments that defied logic. 

Today's case was no exception. A frantic farmer named Jebediah had called earlier, claiming his prize-winning rooster, Reginald, was refusing to crow, convinced the bird was suffering from stage fright. Amelia, ever the professional, had assured him she'd do her best.  But as she looked at the nervous rooster perched on Jebediah's lap, its comb flopping dejectedly, a wave of doubt washed over her.

Was this just another eccentric case in Whispering Pines, or was something truly strange afoot?
