The aroma of roasted garlic and rosemary clung to Emilia Beaumont like a second skin. It was a familiar scent in her small, sun-drenched office overlooking the bustling farmer's market in Asheville, North Carolina.  Emilia, with her auburn braid cascading down her back and eyes as blue as a summer sky, sighed contentedly. This was her haven - surrounded by fresh produce, vibrant flowers, and the cheerful chatter of vendors she knew by name.

Today, however, Emilia wasn't focused on the delicious smells wafting from the market stalls below. Her brow furrowed as she stared at the spreadsheet on her computer screen. It detailed the dietary needs of her newest client, a renowned novelist struggling with crippling anxiety manifested in severe food aversions.  Emilia tapped her pen against the desk, wondering how she could possibly craft a meal plan that would soothe both his stomach and his soul.
