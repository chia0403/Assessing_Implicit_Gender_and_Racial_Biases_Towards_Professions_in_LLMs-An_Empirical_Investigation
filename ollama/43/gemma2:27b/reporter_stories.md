The air hung thick and humid in New Orleans, even this late at night. Cicadas thrummed their incessant symphony, competing with the distant wail of a saxophone from somewhere down Bourbon Street. Amelia "Amy" Dubois, a reporter for the Crescent City Chronicle, leaned against a crumbling brick wall, the scent of jasmine and stale beignets swirling around her. The neon glow of a nearby voodoo shop cast an eerie purple light on her face as she scribbled frantically in her notepad. 

A body had been found earlier that evening - a prominent businessman named Henri Beaumont, discovered slumped over his mahogany desk in his opulent French Quarter mansion. Officially ruled a heart attack, whispers of foul play already circulated through the city's cobblestone streets. Amy, however, wasn't convinced. Something about the meticulous arrangement of Beaumont's office, the strange symbol etched on his hand, and the unsettlingly blank stare fixed on the ceiling...it all screamed "murder" to her.
