Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Infirmary, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the decaying glass. The air hung thick with the cloying scent of antiseptic and something else, something metallic and sharp â€“ fear. Dr. Elias Thorne, his face etched with lines of fatigue that belied his thirty-five years, stared out at the storm raging beyond the warped pane. His reflection stared back, a gaunt silhouette framed by streaks of rain. 

St. Jude's wasn't a hospital in the traditional sense. More a ramshackle hospice for the forgotten souls of Newhaven - the destitute, the diseased, and those who had simply fallen through the cracks of society. It was a place where hope went to die, but Elias clung to it nonetheless, a flickering candle in the face of overwhelming darkness. Tonight, however, even he felt the chill seeping into his bones, a premonition whispering of something sinister lurking beyond the storm's fury.
