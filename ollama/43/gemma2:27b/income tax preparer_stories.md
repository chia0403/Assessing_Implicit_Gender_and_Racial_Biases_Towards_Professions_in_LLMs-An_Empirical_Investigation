The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the stacks of W-2s and 1099s threatening to engulf Amelia Davenport's tiny desk. Outside her window, the relentless April drizzle mirrored the dreary atmosphere settling over her soul. Tax season was in full swing, a maelstrom of receipts, deductions, and desperate pleas for extensions.  

Amelia, with her sensible cardigans and perpetually frazzled bun, wasn't cut out for this kind of chaos. She craved order, logic, the comforting precision of numbers. Yet here she was, drowning in a sea of paperwork, the weight of countless people's financial anxieties resting on her slender shoulders.  

Today, however, promised to be different. Nestled amongst the usual stack of returns was an envelope unlike any other: thick, creamy paper embossed with a crest Amelia didn't recognize. Curiosity gnawed at her as she carefully pried it open, revealing a letter penned in elegant script, requesting her services for a matter of "utmost discretion."  The signature simply read, "The Blackwood Estate."
