The air in the abandoned amusement park hung thick with the smell of ozone and rust. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight piercing through shattered glass panes of the Ferris wheel's carriages. Elias Thorne adjusted his tool belt, the weight of pliers, screwdrivers, and wire strippers familiar against his hip. The rusted groan of a loose panel on the dilapidated rollercoaster echoed around him, a chilling counterpoint to the cheerful calliope music faintly emanating from a busted speaker system.

Elias was here for a job â€“ a strange one, even for an electrician who'd seen his share of oddities. He'd been contacted by a woman claiming to be the last descendant of the park's founder, begging him to restore power to the neglected wonderland. She insisted it held a "secret heart," something magical that needed Elias's help to awaken. Skeptical but intrigued, he'd accepted the task, drawn by the melancholic beauty of the decaying structures and the promise of something truly unique. 

He knelt down, examining the frayed wires leading into the boarded-up arcade. "Let's see what we've got here," he muttered, flipping open his multimeter. The faded paint on the arcade sign read "Carnival of Curiosities," a name that seemed to whisper a forgotten enchantment.
