The air conditioner wheezed in the corner, struggling to combat the oppressive July heat seeping through the old brick walls of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental practice. Sunlight, fierce and unrelenting, slanted through the grimy windowpane, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path. The waiting room, usually a haven of calming blues and greens, felt stifling. Even the potted fern seemed to droop under the weight of the day.

The chipped linoleum floor, the outdated magazines on the coffee table, the faint scent of antiseptic struggling against a backdrop of musty old furniture â€“ it all felt weary, mirroring her own exhaustion.
