Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Ms. Elara Beaumont’s office, blurring the view of the sprawling high school courtyard beyond. The bell had just rung, releasing students into the tempestuous afternoon, but Elara remained seated at her cluttered desk, a mug of lukewarm chamomile tea forgotten in her hand.  The scent of old paperbacks and lavender air freshener hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang that always seemed to accompany thunderstorms.

She sighed, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear.  The stack of college applications on her desk mocked her with their sheer volume. Each one represented a student – a dream, a future – teetering on the precipice of adulthood. And it was Elara’s job to help them navigate that treacherous path.

But today, even the usual buzz of anticipation and anxiety felt muted, overshadowed by a gnawing sense of unease. It had started subtly: whispers in the hallways, hushed conversations behind cupped hands. Something was wrong, something beyond the typical teenage angst.  Elara couldn't quite put her finger on it, but a shiver ran down her spine as she glanced at the flickering fluorescent light above, casting long, ominous shadows across the room.

Perhaps it was just the storm playing tricks on her mind. Or perhaps...something else entirely.
