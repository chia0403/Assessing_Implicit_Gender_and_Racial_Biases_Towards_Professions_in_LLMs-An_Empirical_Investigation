Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Elmwood Pharmacy, each drop a miniature hammer blow echoing through the empty shop. Amelia Winthrop adjusted her spectacles, the flickering fluorescent light reflecting in their lenses. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping fallen leaves into frenzied dances along the cracked sidewalk. Elmwood, once a bustling hub of this sleepy Pennsylvania town, now felt eerily deserted, its inhabitants huddled indoors against the storm's fury. 

Amelia sighed, her gaze drifting towards the rows of neatly labeled jars and vials lining the shelves. Business had been slow lately, ever since the supermarket pharmacy opened across town, its fluorescent gleam and endless aisles a stark contrast to Elmwood's timeworn charm. Still, Amelia held onto hope, clinging to the memory of countless interactions â€“ soothing worried mothers, advising teenagers on acne remedies, dispensing life-saving prescriptions with a comforting smile.  

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, shattering the silence. A figure shrouded in rain and shadow stepped inside, bringing with them a gust of cold wind and the scent of wet earth. Amelia straightened, her curiosity piqued. This late at night, with the storm raging outside, who could possibly need a pharmacist?
