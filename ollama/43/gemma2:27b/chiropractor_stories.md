Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's practice, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside her.  Her small chiropractic office, nestled in the heart of quaint Willow Creek, was normally a haven of tranquility. The scent of lavender essential oil always hung in the air, mingling with the faint crackle of the antique radio playing soft jazz. Today, however, the air felt heavy, thick with unspoken anxieties. Eleanor glanced at the clock - 4:57 pm. Her last patient had cancelled, leaving her with a gnawing emptiness and an unsettling premonition.

Outside, the wind howled like a mournful banshee, whipping fallen leaves into frenzied dances across the deserted street. Willow Creek, usually bustling with its quirky charm, felt eerily still, shrouded in an unnatural gloom. Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something was terribly wrong.
