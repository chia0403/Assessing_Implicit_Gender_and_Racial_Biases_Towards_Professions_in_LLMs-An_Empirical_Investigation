The late afternoon sun slanted through the oversized windows of Mrs. Penelope Evergreen's kindergarten classroom, casting long shadows from the brightly colored alphabet blocks scattered across the floor.  A faint scent of crayons and glue hung in the air, mingling with the lingering sweetness of juice boxes emptied during snack time. Outside, the cacophony of the schoolyard echoed faintly through the open window, a symphony of shrieking laughter and bouncing basketballs.

Penelope, her auburn braid swinging gently as she moved, crouched beside five-year-old Liam, patiently coaxing him to finish gluing feathers onto his paper owl.  Liam, with the intense focus only a kindergartener can muster, was meticulously placing each feather, muttering to himself about which shade of brown best matched the owl's wings. Penelope smiled, her heart warming at the sight. This was her favorite time of day - the quiet lull before dismissal, when the whirlwind energy of the morning had settled and she could connect with each child individually.

But today, a disquiet lingered beneath the surface of Penelopeâ€™s usual serenity. A strange package had arrived that afternoon, addressed in loopy handwriting she didn't recognize. It sat unopened on her desk, a jarring note in the otherwise familiar landscape of finger paintings and construction paper dinosaurs.
