Rain lashed against the windowpane of Elias Thorne's small massage therapy studio, blurring the already dim streetlights outside into shimmering orbs. The scent of lavender oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy fragrance of sandalwood incense burning on a tiny altar in the corner. Elias, his long fingers kneading dough for a sourdough loaf he planned to bake later, listened to the rhythmic drumming of the storm. It was nights like these that brought him a strange sense of peace. The city outside seemed to hold its breath, anxieties lulled by the relentless downpour.  

Elias himself, however, felt a knot of tension in his own shoulders, a sensation he usually only encountered in clients after a particularly stressful day. Tonight, it was anticipation that gnawed at him. A new client was scheduled for 8 pm â€“ Anya Petrova, a renowned ballerina with a reputation for being demanding and aloof. Elias had treated his fair share of dancers over the years, their bodies honed to perfection but often riddled with aches and strains. But Anya Petrova was different.  Her name whispered through the ballet world like a legend, a whisper he couldn't help but feel intimidated by.
