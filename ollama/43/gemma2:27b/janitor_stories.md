The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune, casting a sickly yellow glow over the polished linoleum floor. Bartholomew Quince, his mop clutched in a gnarled hand like a trusty weapon, surveyed the sprawling gymnasium with weary eyes. Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated by the unforgiving light, and the echoing silence amplified the squeak of Bartholomew's worn-out sneakers as he shuffled across the court.

The once vibrant colors of the murals depicting local sporting heroes now seemed faded and forlorn, mirroring Bartholomewâ€™s own sense of disillusionment. He had been janitor at Willow Creek High for 25 years, witnessing generations of students pass through these halls, leaving their laughter and tears etched into the very fabric of the building.

But tonight felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, broken only by the distant thump of a basketball bouncing somewhere in the depths of the school.  Bartholomew paused, his bushy eyebrows furrowing as he listened intently. The sound seemed to be coming from the old weight room, a place rarely used these days, shrouded in shadows and whispered rumors. He hesitated, a flicker of apprehension dancing in his usually placid blue eyes. Something wasn't right.

This wasn't just another night shift for Bartholomew Quince. Tonight, something was about to change.
