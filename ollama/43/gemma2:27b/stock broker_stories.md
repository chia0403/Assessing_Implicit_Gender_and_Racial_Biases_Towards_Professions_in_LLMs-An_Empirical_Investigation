The insistent chirping of his Blackberry pierced through Theodore “Teddy” Albright’s dreams, dragging him from a pleasant reverie about sun-drenched beaches and bottomless margaritas.  Groaning, he slapped at the nightstand until the offending device fell silent.  He squinted at the glowing screen – 4:37 AM.  Another pre-dawn market panic. This was becoming a weekly occurrence.

Teddy sat up in his king-sized bed, the crisp Egyptian cotton sheets rustling around him.  The city lights of Manhattan shimmered through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his penthouse apartment, a stark contrast to the darkness settling over Central Park below. He was living the dream, wasn't he? The corner office at Albright & Sons, Wall Street pedigree, and enough money to never work another day in his life. But lately, Teddy felt more like a hamster on a wheel, constantly spinning but going nowhere. 

The Blackberry chirped again, reminding him that time was money – literally. He flung off the covers, grabbed the phone, and headed towards the sleek, minimalist kitchen where his espresso machine stood ready to fuel his day. Today, he had a feeling, would be different.
