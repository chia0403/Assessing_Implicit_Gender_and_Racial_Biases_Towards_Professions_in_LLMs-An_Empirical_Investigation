Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, each drop an insistent drumbeat echoing through the cavernous space.  The air hung heavy with the scent of hay, manure, and something else â€“ a faint metallic tang that made Eloise Montgomery wrinkle her nose. She paused by the stall of Buttercup, a gentle mare with a chestnut coat dappled in white, listening intently to the distressed snorts coming from within. Eloise ran a hand along Buttercup's velvety muzzle, murmuring soothing words while she assessed the situation. Something was definitely wrong.

Eloise Montgomery wasn't just any animal caretaker; she was the heart and soul of Whispering Willows Sanctuary, a haven for abandoned, injured, and neglected creatures nestled deep in the rolling hills of Kentucky.
