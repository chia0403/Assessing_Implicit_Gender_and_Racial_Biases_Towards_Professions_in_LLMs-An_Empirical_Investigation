The insistent chirp of his phone dragged Theodore Alistair Finch from a dream filled with misplaced commas and rogue em dashes. He swatted at the nightstand, muttering a curse under his breath as the offending device finally fell silent. Dawn was barely peeking over the rooftops of Brooklyn, painting the sky in muted shades of lavender and grey.

Theodore's small apartment felt cramped after a night spent curled up on the couch with a manuscript about artisanal cheesemaking. The scent of aged cheddar still lingered faintly in the air, mingling with the familiar aroma of black coffee brewing in his ancient percolator. He stretched, wincing as his back popped in protest, and padded towards the kitchen window.

The view wasn't much – just the brick wall of the building next door and a sliver of sky choked by chimneys and fire escapes. But Theodore found a peculiar comfort in it, a reminder that even amidst the chaos and cacophony of the city, there was always a quiet corner to be found. Today, however, the quiet felt different. An unsettling hum vibrated beneath his feet, a tremor he couldn't quite place.

He glanced at his phone, now displaying a message from his boss: "URGENT - New manuscript arrived. Need your expert eye ASAP." Theodore sighed, knowing full well what that meant – another all-nighter fuelled by caffeine and the desperate need to meet deadlines. But as he picked up the steaming mug of coffee, the tremor intensified, morphing into a low rumble that seemed to shake the very foundation of his building. He looked out the window again, this time noticing something truly peculiar: the brick wall next door was shimmering, its surface rippling like water.
