The Nevada desert stretched out before Elias "Eli" Blackwood like a wrinkled canvas, bleached by the merciless sun and stitched together with faded highway lines. His rig, a hulking Peterbilt named “Betsy” after his late grandmother, rumbled along Interstate 80, her diesel engine groaning a familiar lullaby. Eli squinted through the dust swirling in his wake, his weathered face reflecting years spent under this unforgiving sky. He'd been hauling freight for over twenty years, his life measured out in miles and rest stops, coffee and CB chatter. Today's load was a double-decker trailer crammed with solar panels, headed for a burgeoning eco-community in California.

Eli adjusted the brim of his trucker hat, shielding his eyes from the glare. The radio crackled with static, punctuated by the occasional snippet of country music or truckers gossiping about road closures and bad weather. He reached for his thermos, hoping the lukewarm coffee would jolt him awake after another long night behind the wheel. But something felt different today. A prickling unease snaked down his spine, a feeling he couldn't quite shake off. The desert had always been a harsh mistress, but there was an unsettling stillness in the air, as if the land itself were holding its breath.
