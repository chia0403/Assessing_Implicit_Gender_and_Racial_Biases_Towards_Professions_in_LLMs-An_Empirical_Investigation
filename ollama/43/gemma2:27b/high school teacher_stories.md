The flickering fluorescent lights of Ms. Beatrice Eleanor Finch's classroom buzzed incessantly, mirroring the chaotic energy thrumming through her veins. It was 7:58 am, two minutes until the bell would unleash another torrent of teenagers upon her neatly stacked desks and meticulously curated bulletin board adorned with Shakespearean sonnets. Beatrice, a woman who believed passionately in the power of language and literature, sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Today was going to be a long one.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor of Mrs. Finch's English classroom at Hawthorne High School. The windows overlooked the sprawling football field, where the distant thud of practice balls punctuated the air. Despite the vibrant autumnal hues painting the trees outside, Beatrice felt an encroaching sense of dread. A new semester had just begun, and this year, she was teaching the notoriously challenging "British Literature" class to a group of juniors who seemed more interested in their smartphones than sonnets.

Beatrice straightened her cardigan, adjusted her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, and braced herself for the onslaught.
