The sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's neck, sweat already slicking his skin despite it only being 7 am.  He squinted at the dusty expanse before him, an old quarry slated for demolition. Mountains of jagged grey rock loomed like slumbering giants under a cloudless Arizona sky. A chorus of cicadas buzzed from the nearby scrubland, their sound a constant thrumming against the silence of the abandoned site.

Silas adjusted the brim of his faded Caterpillar cap and swung himself into the cab of his trusty excavator, "Betsy."  She was an old girl, her paint chipped and dented, but she purred like a kitten under his calloused hands. Today's job was simple: clear a path for the demolition crew by knocking down a few dilapidated sheds and hauling away debris. A routine day in the life of Silas Blackwood, heavy equipment operator extraordinaire.
