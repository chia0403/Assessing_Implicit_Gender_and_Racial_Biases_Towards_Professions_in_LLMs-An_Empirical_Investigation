The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting shroud against the encroaching chill of autumn outside. Eleanor Winthrop adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose as she surveyed the cavernous library. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in its golden rays. The silence, broken only by the occasional tick of the grandfather clock in the corner and the soft rustle of pages turning, was a sanctuary Eleanor relished.

Eleanor knew every nook and cranny, every inscription on the worn spines, every secret whispered by the ancient tomes lining the shelves. But today, something felt different. An unsettling prickle danced along her spine as she noticed a new book tucked amongst the classics â€“ its cover plain, devoid of any title or author.
