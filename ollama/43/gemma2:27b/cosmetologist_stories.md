The humid air hung heavy in "Curl Up & Dye," smelling faintly of lavender shampoo and burnt hairspray. Eloise Beaumont, her dark curls piled high on her head in a messy bun, surveyed her domain with a critical eye. The vintage barber chairs, reupholstered in bright turquoise vinyl, gleamed under the fluorescent lights.  Posters advertising outrageous 80s hairstyles adorned the walls, a testament to Eloise's love for all things retro glam. Today, however, the usual buzz of excitement was replaced by a tense quiet. Eloise tapped her acrylic nails on the counter, waiting anxiously for her first client of the day.  It wasn't the appointment itself that bothered her; it was the client.


Mrs. Ophelia Blackwood, a woman notorious in their small town for her eccentricities and sharp tongue, had booked a "complete transformation." Eloise shuddered, remembering Mrs. Blackwood's icy glare and scathing remarks about a previous stylist who dared to suggest a side part. This time, Eloise knew she couldn't afford to make a mistake. Not only was Mrs. Blackwood a wealthy socialite with the power to make or break a business, but she was also rumored to possess a sixth sense for sniffing out incompetence.  Eloise took a deep breath, reminding herself that she was good at what she did.  She had trained under the best in the city and her skills were undeniable.

But as the salon door creaked open and Mrs. Blackwood swept in, a cloud of expensive perfume preceding her, Eloise couldn't help but feel a knot of apprehension tighten in her stomach.
