Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic tattooing of Elara Hawthorne's fingers on the keyboard. The garret room, tucked away in her grandmother's sprawling Victorian home, was her sanctuary.  Dust motes danced in the single beam of moonlight slicing through the grime-coated glass pane, illuminating stacks of dog-eared manuscripts and overflowing notebooks. Outside, wind howled like a banshee, rattling the loose panes and adding a chilling soundtrack to Elara's writer's block. She stared at the blinking cursor on her screen, a mocking reminder of the empty page that yawned before her.  Tonight, even the tempestuous weather couldn't inspire her. 


Her latest novel, a gothic mystery set in a crumbling manor house haunted by whispers of a forgotten curse, felt as lifeless as the skeletal branches clawing at the window. Elara needed something, anything, to jolt her imagination back to life.

Little did she know that inspiration was about to arrive, not in the form of a muse whispering sweet nothings, but with the thud of heavy footsteps on the creaking stairs leading up to her attic refuge.
