Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the vibrant green smoothie posters plastered across the glass. Inside, Eleanor Finch adjusted her spectacles, the fluorescent lights casting an unflattering sheen on her freckled nose. The scent of turmeric and ginger hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of Eleanor's mission: to help people find joy and wellbeing through healthy eating. Today, however, joy felt about as far away as the sun peeking through those storm clouds. 

A wave of disappointment washed over her. It had been two months since she opened "Nourish & Thrive," pouring her savings and years of nutritional expertise into this dream. Yet, foot traffic remained stubbornly low. She glanced at the empty chairs lining the counter, each one a silent judge of her fledgling business.  Eleanor sighed, pushing aside the mounting anxiety. Today was a new day, and she wouldn't let the dreary weather dampen her spirits.
