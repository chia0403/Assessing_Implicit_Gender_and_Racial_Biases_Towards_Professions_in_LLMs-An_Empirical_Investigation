Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the small town of Oakdale, nestled in the heart of rural New England. The kind of night that made you want to curl up by the fire with a good book and a cup of hot tea, rather than venture out into the damp streets.

In a cozy little apartment above the Oakdale Medical Center, Phoebe Alexandra Wilson stirred in her bed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She was a phlebotomist, responsible for drawing blood samples from patients at the medical center, and she had been working a double shift that day. The exhaustion was starting to catch up with her, but she knew she couldn't afford to take a break now.

As she swung her legs over the side of the bed, her gaze fell upon a photo on her nightstand - a picture of her and her family, taken on a sunny summer day at the beach. Her parents had always encouraged her to pursue a career in healthcare, and she was grateful for their support. But as she gazed at the photo, Phoebe couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had been noticing strange things about her patients lately - little inconsistencies in their stories, unusual symptoms that didn't quite add up.

And now, as she prepared to head down to the medical center for another long night of work, Phoebe couldn't help but wonder if there was more to her job than met the eye.
