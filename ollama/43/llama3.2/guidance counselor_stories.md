Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood High School gleamed like polished stone, reflecting the fluorescent lights that cast an eerie glow over the deserted hallways. Inside, Counselor Emily Rae Jenkins stood outside her office door, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee as she watched the first bell of the new semester ring out across the empty corridors.

As one of the guidance counselors at Ashwood High, Emily had seen it all – from the triumphant graduates who left with college acceptance letters to the heartbroken freshmen struggling to find their place. She took pride in her work, knowing that every student who walked through those doors was a unique puzzle waiting to be solved.

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead as Emily's gaze drifted out the window to the mist-shrouded trees of Ashwood Park, where she often went for solace on nights like these. The rain-lashed streets were usually deserted this time of year, but tonight felt different – tonight felt like something was building, just beneath the surface.

Emily's phone buzzed with a text from her colleague, Rachel Lee, asking about the weekend's schedule. Emily smiled to herself as she typed out a response, feeling a sense of normalcy wash over her despite the nagging sense that something was off. Little did she know, this would be just the beginning of a semester that would test everything she thought she knew about Ashwood High and its students – including herself.
