Here's a potential story opening and setting:

In the small coastal town of Willow Creek, where the salty sea air carried the scent of saltwater taffy and sunscreen, and the sound of seagulls filled the air, 25-year-old Ava Elizabeth Thompson worked as a hairdresser at "Tidal Waves" salon. Ava's long, curly brown hair was a perfect match for her warm and inviting smile, and her bright green eyes sparkled with creativity as she worked on every client who walked through the door.

The salon itself was a cozy, beach-themed haven, adorned with shells, driftwood, and vintage nautical posters. The walls were painted a soft, sunny yellow, and the floors creaked beneath Ava's feet as she moved from station to station, her scissors snipping away at locks of every length and color.

As the sun began to set on another busy day in Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy town, Ava was busy preparing for the evening rush. She had just finished styling a client's hair and was now wiping down the counter when the door swung open, admitting a new customer - one who would change everything.
