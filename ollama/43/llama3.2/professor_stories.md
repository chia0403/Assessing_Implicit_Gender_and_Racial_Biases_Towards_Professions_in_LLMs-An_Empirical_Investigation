Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

Professor Evelyn Alexandra Wynter stood at the edge of the old, worn wooden pier that jutted out into the misty dawn of Lake Tahoe. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of pine trees and damp earth as the snow-capped peaks of the surrounding Sierra Nevada mountains gazed down upon her like sentinels. As a professor of environmental studies at the University of California, Berkeley, Evelyn had spent countless hours studying the effects of climate change on this beloved alpine lake, but she had never lost her sense of wonder and awe as she gazed out across its tranquil waters.

The university's research vessel, the "Sea Dragon," was moored in a nearby cove, its crew busily preparing for the day's excursion into the lake. Evelyn's eyes scanned the horizon, her mind racing with thoughts of the upcoming expedition - the team had been tracking an unusual pattern of algal blooms in the upper reaches of the lake, and she suspected that this year's sampling would reveal more than just a simple case of eutrophication.

As the sun began to rise above the mountains, casting a golden glow over the water, Evelyn felt a shiver run down her spine. She had always loved this time of day - there was something about the way the light danced across the waves that seemed to hint at secrets hidden beneath the surface. And she knew that today, she would be one step closer to uncovering some of those secrets.

How's that? I've created a somewhat atmospheric setting for Evelyn Alexandra Wynter, a professor with an interest in environmental studies and climate change.
