Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Nurse Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her compact sedan and onto the wet pavement. The neon signs of Pike Place Market reflected off the droplets, casting an ethereal glow over the bustling streets. Lexi shivered, adjusting her waterproof jacket to ward off the chill that had seeped into her bones. She was headed to the hospital, where a mysterious patient had been admitted with a cryptic injury that had left the ER staff scratching their heads.

As she walked towards the entrance of Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital, Lexi's mind replayed the events leading up to this moment. The phone call from the dispatcher, the long drive through the rain-soaked night, and the hospital's hushed whispers about a patient so enigmatic that even the most seasoned docs were hesitant to touch him. Lexi's curiosity was piqued; she had a reputation for being one of the best nurses in the city, but this case seemed to be shrouded in mystery.

With her stethoscope slung over her shoulder and her eyes fixed on the hospital's gleaming facade, Lexi felt a thrill of anticipation. She knew that this patient was about to test her skills like never before. Little did she know, their encounter would change her life forever.
