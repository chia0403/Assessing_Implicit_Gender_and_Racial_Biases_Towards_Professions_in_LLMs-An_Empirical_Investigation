Here's a potential story opening and setting for an elementary school teacher:

**Opening:**

Ms. Evelyn Mae Thompson stood in front of her classroom, surveying the sea of expectant young faces before her. It was the first day of the new school year at Oakdale Elementary, and she was determined to make it one that none of her students would ever forget. As she wrote her own name on the chalkboard in bold, colorful letters - "Ms. Evelyn Mae Thompson" - she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

**Setting:**

Oakdale Elementary School, a small, historic building nestled in the heart of a quaint, rural town surrounded by rolling hills and dense forests. The school had been a staple of the community for generations, and Ms. Thompson felt proud to be its latest teacher. As she looked around her classroom, she noticed the same familiar faces that had been there the year before: Timmy's mischievous grin, Emily's shy smile, and Jake's rugged determination.

But as she began to take attendance and introduce herself, Ms. Thompson couldn't help but feel a sense of unease. The town was quieter than usual this summer, and the few families who had moved in over the past year seemed...different. Some of them kept to themselves, while others seemed to be watching her every move.

As she glanced out the window at the late-summer sunshine casting long shadows across the playground, Ms. Thompson wondered if she was just being paranoid. After all, Oakdale Elementary was a place where everyone knew each other's names, and the most excitement that usually broke the surface of everyday life was the annual summer fair.

Or so she thought.
