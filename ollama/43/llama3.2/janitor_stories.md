Here's a potential story opening:

---

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the worn linoleum floor of St. Michael's High School. Janitor Edwin Joseph Harrington pushed his cart through the empty hallway, the soft creak of the wheels echoing off the walls as he made his way to the staff room for a much-needed break.

It was 3:45 PM on a typical Wednesday afternoon in late February – the kind of day where the cold air outside seemed to seep into every corner of the school, making even the most mundane tasks feel like an endurance test. Edwin had been working as the janitor at St. Michael's for over five years, and he knew its rhythms and routines better than anyone.

As he entered the staff room, the warm scent of stale coffee and yesterday's lunch wafted out to greet him. The other teachers were chatting and laughing, oblivious to the quiet desperation that often accompanied Edwin's daily routine. He poured himself a cup of cold coffee from the pot on the counter, his eyes scanning the room for any signs of trouble – paper jams, broken machinery, or perhaps that latest mess left by some inconsiderate student.

For Edwin, it wasn't just about keeping the school clean; it was about being a steady presence amidst the chaos. He took pride in knowing every nook and cranny of this worn place, and he felt a strange sense of responsibility for its maintenance. Little did he know, however, that this ordinary day would soon take an extraordinary turn.
