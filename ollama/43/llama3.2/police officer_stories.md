Here's a potential story opening:

Detective Emily Anne Ryder stepped out of her cruiser and onto the deserted stretch of Highway 12, the only sound being the distant hum of the highway and the creaking of the old oak trees that lined the roadside. It was a crisp autumn evening in the small town of Oakdale, Illinois, where Detective Ryder had grown up and now worked as a seasoned police officer.

The streets were usually quiet at this hour, but tonight something felt off. Ryder's instincts told her that whatever had brought her to this spot was no ordinary accident or crime scene. She took a deep breath, feeling the familiar coolness of the autumn air fill her lungs, and began to survey the area.

As she looked around, Ryder noticed a small clearing up ahead, surrounded by a ring of tall trees and what appeared to be a makeshift parking area for RVs. A lone figure was huddled on the ground, shivering under a thin blanket. Ryder's heart quickened as she approached the scene - this didn't feel like an accident at all.

The figure slowly looked up, revealing a young woman with piercing green eyes and long, curly brown hair. She seemed to be in her early twenties, but there were signs of trauma etched on her face that told Ryder that this was no ordinary lost tourist.

"Ma'am?" Ryder said softly, trying not to scare the young woman further. "Can I help you? What's going on?"

But before the woman could respond, a low growl echoed through the night air, sending shivers down Ryder's spine...
