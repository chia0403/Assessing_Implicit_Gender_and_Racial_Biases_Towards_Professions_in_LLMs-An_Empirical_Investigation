Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly Wednesday evening in April when Maxwell Wyatt Thompson, a quiet but resourceful bell hop at the luxurious Grand Oak Hotel, began to feel like something was off. He had spent the day helping guests with their luggage, answering questions about local attractions, and pouring them cups of coffee as they sipped it by the fireplace in the lobby. But now, as he polished a silver nameplate on his cart for what felt like the hundredth time that day, Maxwell's mind kept wandering to the mysterious letter he had received earlier that morning.

The letter was from an unknown sender, and it bore no return address or indication of who might have written it. All it said was: "Meet me at room 314 if you want to know what's really going on in this hotel." Maxwell's curiosity was piqued - room 314 was a luxury suite that few guests ever got to see, and it was usually reserved for high-rollers and VIPs.

As he finished his chores and clocked out of the day, Maxwell couldn't shake the feeling that something was indeed amiss at the Grand Oak. The hotel had always been a pillar of the community, but lately, there seemed to be an undercurrent of tension beneath its polished surfaces. And now, it seemed, Maxwell had stumbled into something much bigger than himself.

The dimly lit corridors of the Grand Oak stretched out before him like a labyrinth, lined with soft plush carpets and gleaming chrome fixtures that seemed to whisper promises of indulgence and excess. The sound of laughter and music drifted from the penthouse bar on the top floor, mingling with the scent of expensive perfume and cigar smoke. It was a world away from Maxwell's own humble existence as a bell hop - but somehow, tonight felt like it might be the night that changed everything.
