Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy mist over the towering skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan. Amidst the steel and glass giants, one small office stood out - a humble accounting firm nestled between a vintage clothing store and a Korean deli. The sign above the door read "Kwan & Associates" in faded letters, while the name "Emily Kwan" was scribbled on the doorframe in elegant calligraphy.

Inside, Emily Kwan sat hunched over her desk, surrounded by stacks of financial reports and tax returns that seemed to stretch up to the ceiling. Her eyes scanned the numbers with a practiced intensity, her brow furrowed in concentration as she searched for the one discrepancy that would crack the code to her next client's missing income. A petite woman in her mid-thirties with short black hair and wire-rimmed glasses, Emily was a force to be reckoned with behind the scenes - but even she couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been growing inside her since the mysterious phone call earlier that morning.

As she delved deeper into the numbers, a shiver ran down Emily's spine. The caller on the other end had been tight-lipped and menacing, their words echoing in her mind like a cold wind: "You shouldn't be poking your nose into things you don't understand." Suddenly, the rain-soaked streets outside seemed to fade into insignificance as Emily wondered - was she playing with fire?
