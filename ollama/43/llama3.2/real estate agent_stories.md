Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the bustling city of New Orleans, casting a warm orange glow over the French Quarter's crumbling facades and vibrant street performers. The air was thick with the scent of beignets from Café du Monde and the distant tang of Lake Pontchartrain.

Inside the opulent office of "LeDomaine Realty," a small sign above the reception desk read "Estelle LaRue, Associate Broker." Estelle, a sharp-tongued and charming real estate agent in her late 30s, sat at her desk sipping on a lukewarm coffee as she scanned the evening's listings. Her eyes landed on a particularly intriguing property: a stunning Creole townhouse nestled in the heart of Treme, with high ceilings, hardwood floors, and a sprawling courtyard perfect for outdoor entertaining.

As Estelle began to mentally calculate the potential profits of listing this property, her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her colleague, Rachel. "Hey, Estelle! Just got word that the Harrison family's asking $2 million for their historic home on Esplanade Avenue. We need to get on it ASAP – they're not getting any younger."
