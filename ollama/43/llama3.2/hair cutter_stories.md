Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a hair cutter as the main character:

Opening:

The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and shops. Inside the "Snips & Scissors" salon, Emilia Ruby LaRue was busy prepping for the evening's appointments. She carefully tied her apron strings and took a deep breath, the scent of lavender and coconut oil filling her senses as she mentally prepared herself for another day of cutting hair.

Setting:

Willow Creek was a charming small town nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. The main street was lined with independent shops, cafes, and restaurants, each one uniquely owned and operated by its residents. The local newspaper, the "Willow Creek Chronicle", had just been sold to Emilia's father, owner of the beloved family bakery, LaRue's Sweet Treats.

As Emilia finished her prepping, she gazed out the salon window, watching as the townspeople strolled by, their heads held high in conversation. The salon was situated above a vintage clothing store, where customers often came to browse while they waited for their appointments. A sign on the door creaked gently in the breeze, bearing Emilia's name and the shop's motto: "A Cut Above the Rest".

Emilia felt a sense of pride knowing that her father had entrusted her with running the salon, as well as helping to publish the Chronicle. She was determined to make both businesses thrive, even if it meant navigating the ups and downs of small-town life. Little did she know, tonight would bring an unexpected surprise that would change everything.
