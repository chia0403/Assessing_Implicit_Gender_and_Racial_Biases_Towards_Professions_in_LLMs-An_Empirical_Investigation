Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Emilia Adelaide Wynter stood at the edge of the hospital's rooftop garden, gazing out over the cityscape as the sun dipped below the horizon. The cool evening breeze carried the faint scent of blooming jasmine and fresh-cut grass, a welcome respite from the sterile smells that wafted up from the wards below. As she breathed in deeply, Emilia felt a sense of peace wash over her, a fleeting moment of calm before the chaos of her shift was about to begin.

The hospital's rooftop garden was a hidden oasis, tucked away from prying eyes and bustling with life despite its remote location. It was here that Emilia often came to escape the weight of her responsibilities as a surgeon at New Haven General Hospital, where she spent most of her days fighting for the lives of patients torn apart by illness and injury. Tonight, however, the garden felt especially tranquil, perhaps because it was a rare evening when the rain had stayed away.

As Emilia turned back towards the hospital's sleek glass fa√ßade, her eyes caught sight of a piece of paper stuck to the window frame, a small note scrawled in hasty handwriting: "Meet me in room 304 at midnight. -J." A shiver ran down her spine as she hesitated for a moment before tucking the note into her pocket and turning back towards the garden's serene silence.

The question was, who could have left that cryptic message? And what did they want with Dr. Emilia Wynter?
