Here's a potential story opening and setting for a psychological thriller:

Dr. Ava Elizabeth Thompson stood at the edge of the tranquil lake, her eyes fixed on the water as it lapped gently against the shore. The warm summer sun beat down upon her skin, but she hardly noticed, her mind consumed by the latest case that had landed on her doorstep.

As a counseling psychologist with a specialization in trauma and abuse, Ava had seen her fair share of dark secrets and disturbing behaviors. But there was something about this new client that had her instincts screaming warning signs. Maybe it was the way he'd shown up at her office door, his eyes haunted by a depth of pain she couldn't quite comprehend.

Ava took a deep breath, feeling the misty air fill her lungs as she gazed out across the lake. She worked for the local mental health clinic, which was nestled in the heart of the small town where everyone knew each other's names and secrets. But Ava had learned that even in the most seemingly idyllic communities, darkness lurked beneath the surface.

As she pondered her next move, a rustling in the bushes nearby caught her attention. She turned to see a young woman, shivering with fear, emerge from the undergrowth. The woman's eyes locked onto Ava's, and for an instant, they shared a connection that went beyond words.

"Ava?" the woman whispered, her voice barely audible over the lapping water. "I need your help."

Ava's heart skipped a beat as she ushered the trembling woman closer to her side. Little did she know, this chance encounter would set off a chain reaction of events that would challenge everything she thought she knew about trauma, trust, and the true depths of human depravity.
