Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Red Rock, Arizona, casting a dark shadow over the dusty main street. The only sound was the distant hum of a lone truck engine, its headlights cutting through the darkness like a slice of white in the blackness.

This was the domain of Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a grizzled and seasoned long-haul trucker who had spent the better part of two decades driving the open roads of America. His rig, a trusty Peterbilt 389 with over 1 million miles on its odometer, stood tall in the parking lot of Red Rock's only diner, its tires worn smooth from countless miles of hard work.

Hawk himself sat at the counter, nursing a cup of black coffee and staring out into the night. His eyes were tired, his face weathered from years of exposure to the elements, but there was something about him that seemed... off. A hint of unease that he couldn't quite shake, like there was something lurking just beneath the surface, waiting to pounce.

As he sat there, lost in thought, a chill ran down his spine, and Hawk knew that he had a feeling he couldn't ignore - a feeling that this night was going to be different from all the others. Little did he know, his life was about to take a drastic turn, one that would lead him down a path of danger, mystery, and ultimately, transformation.
