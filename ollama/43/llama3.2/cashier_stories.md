Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had long since set on the small town of Oakdale, casting a golden glow over the worn asphalt of Main Street. The streets were quiet, save for the occasional distant rumble of a car driving by or the soft hum of the diner's neon sign that cast a gaudy light across the sidewalk.

Inside the local convenience store, "Sammy's Saver", cashiers worked diligently to ring up the last-minute purchases of the evening. Sammy Sue Jenkins, a 25-year-old Oakdale native with a warm smile and a no-nonsense attitude, stood behind the register, her eyes fixed on the customer in front of her - an elderly woman named Mrs. Thompson.

As Sammy rang up Mrs. Thompson's groceries, she couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over her. She had always dreamed of leaving Oakdale behind and seeing the world beyond its borders, but life had taken a different turn. For now, she was stuck working at her family's convenience store, juggling late nights with early morning shifts, and trying to make ends meet.

As Mrs. Thompson finished up and headed out into the chilly night air, Sammy couldn't shake the feeling that something - anything - was about to change. Little did she know, a phone call from an unknown number would set off a chain of events that would disrupt her life forever.
