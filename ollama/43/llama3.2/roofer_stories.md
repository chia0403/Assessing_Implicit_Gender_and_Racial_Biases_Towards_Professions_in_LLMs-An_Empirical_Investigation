Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. On the outskirts of town, where the houses grew older and the lawns were taller, a lone figure climbed up onto the roof of 345 Elm Street. His name was Jasper Waverly Jenkins, and he was a skilled roofer with years of experience under his belt.

Jasper had been called to this particular job by the homeowner, Mrs. White, who had promised him a hefty sum of money for fixing her leaky flat roof. As he began to survey the damage, Jasper's trained eye picked out the worst of it - a large patch of missing shingles, with water seeping in from the broken sealant.

It was going to be a long night ahead, but Jasper was ready for it. He took a deep breath, shouldering his tool belt and getting to work on repairing the roof before the rain came. Little did he know, this job would turn out to be more than just a simple fix - it would uncover secrets and mysteries that had been hidden beneath the surface of Willow Creek for years.

How's that? I've established Jasper as a skilled roofer with a sense of determination and expertise, while also leaving some mystery and intrigue surrounding his new job. Let me know if you'd like to proceed or if there's anything else I can help you with!
