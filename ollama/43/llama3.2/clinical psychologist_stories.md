Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office building and into the crisp morning air, gazing out over the bustling streets of downtown New Haven. As a clinical psychologist with a private practice specializing in trauma and anxiety disorders, Lexi had seen her fair share of dark days and desperate clients. But on this particular morning, something felt different.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the city's concrete canyons, where towering skyscrapers seemed to loom over the quaint brownstones and charming shops that lined the sidewalks. The sound of sirens echoed through the air, mingling with the hum of traffic and the chatter of pedestrians hurrying to and fro.

Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the familiar knot in her stomach as she made her way down the sidewalk towards the riverfront. She had just finished a particularly grueling session with a new client, and was looking forward to a quiet moment to herself before diving into the day's schedule. As she walked, the misty veil of morning fog began to lift, revealing the glinting lights of the river in the distance.

Little did Lexi know, this morning would be one that would change everything.
