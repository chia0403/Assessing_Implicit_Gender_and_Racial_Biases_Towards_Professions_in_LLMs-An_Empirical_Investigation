The air hung thick with the aroma of woodsmoke and blood, an olfactory symphony that was both intoxicating and repulsive to anyone not born amongst the smell of cured meats.  Bartholomew "Bart" Thorne's hands, calloused and thick like seasoned leather, expertly wielded a cleaver, sending ripples through the slick blade as he carved a plump leg from the hindquarters of a prize-winning ox.  His shop, 'Thorne's Table', was nestled in the heart of the bustling market town of Oakhaven, surrounded by the cacophony of vendors hawking their wares and townsfolk bartering for necessities.

The morning light, filtered through the grimy windows of his shop, cast long shadows on the worn brick walls and wooden counters.  Despite the vibrancy of the town's life around him, Bart found himself drawn to the stillness of the slaughterhouse, where the symphony of blood and muscle became a lullaby.  His workshop was a dance floor of meat, its every surface marked with the stories of countless animals who had been both conquered and sacrificed for the sake of sustenance.
