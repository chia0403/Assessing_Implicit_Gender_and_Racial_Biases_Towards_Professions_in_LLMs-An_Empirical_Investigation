## The Road's Lullaby

The relentless hum of the asphalt grinder vibrated through the soles of Elias Crowe’s boots. He squinted at the vast stretch of road before him, barely able to make out the setting sun bleeding crimson into the already fading twilight.  A million miles of concrete stretched ahead of him, a silent testament to man's ambition and its fleeting grasp on time. Even the air seemed to hold this tension, heavy with the scent of asphalt and the unspoken promise of another sunrise. 

Elias was used to the solitude of his job, hauling out potholes like they were mere pebbles in the grand scheme of things.  He’d been a highway worker all his life, from sweeping up dust to wielding sledgehammers, ever since he'd first set foot on this dusty lot as a boy.  He knew every curve of the asphalt ribbon and every creak of the metal bridge that crossed the valley below. The highway was more than just a road; it was his constant companion, each mile etched into his soul like a familiar melody. 

Tonight, though, even the lullaby of tires on asphalt couldn't quite drown out the unease gnawing at his gut.  There was something different in the air tonight - an unsettling stillness that felt heavy with a secret yet to be whispered.
