Rain lashed against the windowpanes of The Golden Quill, the old office building’s facade practically dripping with water as Amelia "Amy" Thorne hunched over her desk. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of cinnamon and burnt coffee – remnants of Mrs. Periwinkle's afternoon tea ritual.  The storm was a fitting backdrop for the mess that had become Amy's world. 

Three days ago, she’d been just another cog in the bustling city machine: the pleasant receptionist at The Golden Quill, greeting clients, answering phones, and keeping the office from falling apart during Mrs. Periwinkle’s relentless schedule of author readings and book signings. Then came Mr. Fitzwilliam's sudden departure, his cryptic note tucked into her desk drawer a cold fist around Amy's heart. Now, the once familiar office felt like a stage where a play was about to begin - but with every passing minute, it became clear that the script was missing its starting line. 

Amy sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. It wouldn't be long before Mrs. Periwinkle, the woman who believed in Amy's "infinite potential" and had even gifted her a vintage typewriter for her birthday last month, would be back in the office.  The questions lingered, unanswered: why Mr. Fitzwilliam left so abruptly? What was behind his parting words about a “hidden chapter” of their once-strong relationship?

A soft tap on the door broke Amy’s contemplation. It was Mrs. Periwinkle, her face framed by silvering hair and eyes sparkling with a familiar warmth. She held a steaming mug in one hand, "Amy," she said in her signature lilting voice, "I've brewed some chamomile for your nerves."
