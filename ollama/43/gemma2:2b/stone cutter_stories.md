##  A Stone's Silence

**Setting:** A remote island off the coast of Norway. The landscape is rugged: jagged cliffs drop into churning grey seas, while wind-battered pines groan overhead. A single village, nestled in a sheltered bay, consists of weathered wooden houses with thatched roofs and windows like chipped glass eyes. 


**Character:** Eldrin "Oldstone" Bj√∏rnstad, his calloused hands still capable of wielding a chisel as easily as he could his late grandfather's pipe. He wasn't young anymore, but his gaze was sharp as the obsidian he carved from the island's granite heart. Years ago, his family had left this island to find fortune elsewhere, leaving him alone with his craft and the whispers of the sea that echoed in his memories of a childhood spent amongst towering glacial formations.  

The sea here was unforgiving: storms raged on its surface, churning whitecaps against an ever-changing landscape of grey. It wasn't just the wind that felt restless; Eldrin felt it too, like a phantom limb yearning for something he couldn't quite grasp. 


**Opening:**
Eldrin stared at the half-finished carving: a delicate flower, its petals meant to evoke the blooming heather against the harsh backdrop of granite cliffs. The stone was cold in his hands, its texture familiar and comforting as if it held the echo of the island itself. He'd been working on this piece for weeks, the rhythmic chiseling a silent song against the crashing waves. But tonight, something was different. A tremor ran through the air, not from the wind or sea, but from within him, an unnerving premonition that echoed with the unspoken secrets of his ancestors and the stories whispered by the very stones he worked on.
