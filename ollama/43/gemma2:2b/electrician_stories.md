Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Elias Thorne's van like angry fists. The engine hummed a lonely tune, barely audible over the downpour outside as he wrestled with a stubborn cable on the side of a dusty rural road. He was in the middle of nowhere, miles from any town, his only company a chorus of wind whistling through the rusted metal and an ancient radio playing static-laden tunes.  His name? Elias Thorne. A man born under a starlit sky, whose life had been illuminated by circuits and sparks for as long as he could remember.

Elias was no stranger to the biting winds of this desolate patch of earth. He'd spent countless days in his father's workshop, learning the intricate dance between wires and current, tracing the path of unseen energy with his calloused fingertips. His father had been a master electrician, his legacy a beacon guiding Elias through the labyrinthine world of power lines and hidden circuits. Now, years later, he was carving out his own space in this harsh landscape, building an empire on the foundation of his father's wisdom. 

His van, affectionately nicknamed 'The Blue Bolt', bore the weight of his life, a rolling testament to his dedication. Inside, tools gleamed under the harsh fluorescent light like silver scales scattered across a battlefield, waiting for him to call upon their strength once more.
