The dust swirled around Elara's boots as she patrolled the outer ramparts of Atheria City.  A heavy silence hung in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic creak of the old stone walls and the occasional cry of an eagle soaring above. The setting sun painted the horizon a fiery orange, casting long shadows across the deserted streets below. Elara ran her gloved hand through her auburn hair, its ends trailing like molten gold in the twilight. Tonight was supposed to be her night off -  a rare reprieve from the constant vigilance of being a City Guard Captainâ€™s ward. 

But tonight, something felt different. The usual unease that clung to the air seemed thicker, more potent. Elara's gaze swept across the cityscape, her eyes searching for any anomaly in the stillness. A slight tremor in the ground just beneath her feet caught her attention. It was barely noticeable, a whisper of an earth hum, but enough to send a chill down her spine. 

Atheria City was known for its peace, for its resilience against threats both internal and external. But tonight, something felt deeply unsettled - like the very walls themselves were holding their breath. Elara tightened her grip on the hilt of her sword as a low groan echoed from somewhere within the city's depths. It wasn't a natural sound; it pulsed with an undercurrent of unsettling energy that sent a wave of unease through her bones.
