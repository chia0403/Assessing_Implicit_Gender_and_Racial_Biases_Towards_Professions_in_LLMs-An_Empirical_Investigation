The aroma of oil, gasoline, and burnt rubber hung thick in the air as Theodore "Theo" Harding pushed his greasy hands deeper into the engine.  It was his usual Friday ritual: working under the fluorescent-lit garage's skylight, letting the rhythmic whir of tools lull him into a kind of meditative calm. Theo had spent his whole life amongst engines and grease, a lineage forged by generations of auto mechanics in his family. He ran Harding Motors, an old-school repair shop nestled in a quiet corner of Maplewood, Michigan.  It was more than just a job; it was a part of him, a legacy he carried with pride.

The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple as Theo finally wrestled the stubborn spark plug loose. The engine would be fine, but this wasn't just about fixing cars â€“ it was about fixing his own anxieties.  He'd been feeling adrift for months now, like a ship lost at sea without a map, unsure of what direction to take next.  His wife had passed away recently, leaving him alone with the memories and the responsibility of running Harding Motors. 

As he turned off the wrench, his reflection in the engine block shimmered, distorted by the flickering light from above. The worn lines on his face seemed deeper than usual, the weariness etched onto his brow heavy as lead.  His heart yearned for a new course, something beyond the familiar routine. But what could that be?
