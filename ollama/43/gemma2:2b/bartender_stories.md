The air hung thick with smoke and stale dreams in The Rusty Mug, an unassuming dive bar clinging to the edge of town like a forgotten barnacle. Its chipped paint whispered secrets of past moonshine rackets and forgotten fights, while flickering neon signs cast wavering shadows on the worn mahogany booths.  At the heart of it all stood Elian “Eli” Thorne, his face weathered like oak and his calloused hands expertly swirling whiskey in a chipped glass. 

Eli had spent more years behind this bar than he cared to count, watching lives unfold under the hazy glow of fluorescent lights and witnessing both the best and worst of humanity pour through its doors.  The regulars – grizzled miners with stories etched onto their faces, weary travelers with secrets tucked away in their eyes, and lonely housewives seeking solace in a quiet corner - were his family. He was more than just a bartender; he was the silent confidant of their lives. Tonight, however, something felt different. A sense of urgency hung like the smoke itself, leaving Eli feeling out of place, off balance, and strangely, afraid.  The door chimed as a young woman entered, her face masked by shadows, her presence both magnetic and unsettling.
