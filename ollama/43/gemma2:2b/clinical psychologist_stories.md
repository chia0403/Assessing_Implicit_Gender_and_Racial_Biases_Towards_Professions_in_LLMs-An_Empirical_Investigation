The air in Dr. Elias Thorne’s office hung heavy with unspoken anxieties, thick as fog rolling across the floor from his worn, mahogany desk.  His gaze drifted over the cluttered space –  framed photographs of smiling families on the top shelf, stacks of case files in neat rows, and a faded leather-bound copy of “The Art of Happiness” lying abandoned next to a half-empty mug of chamomile tea. Elias had built this life - meticulously, with a quiet dedication that spoke volumes about his own personal struggles. 

He stared out the window at the bustling city street below, where people hurried by their own internal storms. The rain pattered gently against the glass, mimicking the constant rhythm of anxieties plaguing him - worries swirling around a case he'd been working on for weeks:  a young boy named Ethan, with a mind as wild and untamed as the storm clouds gathering outside. 

**Setting:** A quaint, traditional practice in a quiet neighborhood bordering a bustling metropolis. The world outside is full of chaotic energy, yet the space inside feels safe and grounded.


**Main character:** Dr. Elias Thorne, a clinical psychologist with a deep well of empathy, haunted by his own internal struggles.
