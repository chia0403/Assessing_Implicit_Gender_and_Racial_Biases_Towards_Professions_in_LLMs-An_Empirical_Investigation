Her worn-leather shoes clicked against the polished floorboards, a familiar rhythm that echoed through the cavernous halls. 

Ellie, known by all simply as “Ellie”, had lived in this rambling mansion her entire life. Born and raised within its four walls, she was more than just a housekeeper; she was a custodian of memories - whispered conversations under the moonlight, stolen kisses between grand oak doors, unspoken fears laid bare in the dusty corners. The manor wasn't just a dwelling; it held a story woven into every thread, every creak, and every sigh of the wind that whistled through the ancient chimney.
