The aroma of lavender essential oil hung heavy in the air, competing with the faint tang of ozone from the flickering LED lights above Maya's massage table. She ran her thumb over the smooth cedarwood finish of the table, its cool touch a familiar comfort against the chaotic hum that throbbed beneath her skin.  It was 9:45 PM on a Tuesday, and Maya had just finished her last client for the day - an old carpenter whose hands were as gnarled as his weathered knees. He'd drifted off to sleep with a gentle sigh as she kneaded his knotted shoulders, leaving behind a quiet stillness that seemed to echo the exhaustion he carried in his heart.

Her mind, however, was far from peaceful. The weight of worry felt like a physical pressure against her chest, squeezing out her usual calm. Her small apartment overlooking the bustling city felt more suffocating than usual, and even the soothing sound of rain outside couldn't soothe the storm brewing within. Maya knew she needed to find some way to clear this mental fog before it seeped into her next shift tomorrow, especially since she was working an extra night at the spa tonight - a last-minute pick-me-up for a particularly demanding clientele.
