The sterile air hung heavy in the waiting room, thick with anticipation and the faint scent of lavender-scented hand sanitizer.  Evelyn "Ev" Pierce adjusted her white scrubs, the weight of them grounding her as she stared at the expectant faces of the patients lined up like dominoes. It was a Wednesday afternoon, typically the lull before the storm in the Emergency Department where she worked as a phlebotomist.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the room, painting the tired faces and nervous hands with hues of orange and violet. The hum of fluorescent lights seemed to echo the anxieties swirling within Ev herself. This wasn't her usual calm, collected zone. Today felt different, charged with an almost palpable tension.  It was like standing at the precipice of a storm, waiting for the first drop. 

Ev knew it had something to do with the case files she skimmed through before every shift. A new one, filled with details of a young woman who'd recently been brought in after a car accident. The doctorâ€™s notes mentioned a persistent "unease," and Ev found herself unable to shake the feeling that she was staring at a hidden puzzle.
