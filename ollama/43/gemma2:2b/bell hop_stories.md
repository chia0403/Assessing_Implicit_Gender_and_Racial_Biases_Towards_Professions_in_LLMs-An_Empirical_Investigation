## The Night Before

**Setting:**  A bustling Grand Central Station in 1920s New York City. Steam billowed from the elevated tracks, echoing against the towering brick facade of the station's grand entrance. Neon signs cast an alluring, garish glow on the throngs of people rushing past: weary travelers clutching suitcases, businessmen dapperly dressed for their meetings, and couples huddled in whispered conversations.  The air hung thick with smoke, perfume, and the constant hum of the city's heartbeat.

**Main Character:** Reginald "Reggie" Fitzwilliam, a lanky young bellhop with eyes that held both hope and a touch of melancholy. He was stationed by the main elevator, his crisp white uniform a stark contrast to the chaos around him. 

 Reggie sighed deeply, watching the steady stream of travellers file past, each face unique, each story untold. A faint ache settled in his chest as he glanced down at the worn-out leather briefcase clutched in his hand - it held the most precious cargo of all: his grandfather's stories, meticulously typed into a handwritten notebook.  

Tonight was the night. Tonight, Reggie was taking his grandfather's legacy on a journey of its own. 


**Opening:**

"Good evening, folks," Reggie chirped with forced cheerfulness as he saw another family board the train. The woman in floral print coat and her two young children looked tired; they wouldnâ€™t be arriving at their idyllic seaside destination until morning. "First class this way, folks! Enjoy your journey!" He flashed a smile that felt more strained than usual today.  

But then, the sound of footsteps interrupted his routine. A woman with a sharp gaze and a scarlet silk scarf strode past him, eyes locked on the train departing to the west. Her posture was defiant, her lips pressed into a thin line as she hurried towards the platform. 
 "Excuse me," Reggie called out, hoping to catch her attention. He felt strangely compelled to follow her, but something held him back: a premonition of unseen dangers and hidden motives. Something in his gut screamed warning - and he knew it was time to unravel this mystery that seemed to emanate from the very heart of New York City.
