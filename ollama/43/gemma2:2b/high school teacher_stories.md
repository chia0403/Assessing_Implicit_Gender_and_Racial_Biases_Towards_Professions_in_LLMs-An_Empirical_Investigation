The air in Mr. Thorne's English classroom hung thick with humidity and the smell of old books.  Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the worn carpet beneath his feet. It was August 12th, and the cicadas were already humming their endless song – a soundtrack to the lazy days before school started again. Ms. Amelia Thorne meticulously straightened a stack of anthologies, their spines dusty from years in the library's quiet corner. Her gaze drifted towards the clock, its hands ticking down on another summer day that felt both fleeting and interminable. 

Amelia was a creature of routine, her life as structured as her beloved Jane Austen novels. Every Tuesday she ran to the local bakery for a freshly baked apple pastry with a single cup of chamomile tea. Then, back to the classroom, where she'd spend hours rearranging the same lesson plans, the same set of bookshelves, and the same comforting silence before welcoming another wave of teenage anxieties into her life. 
  
But this summer felt different. A restless hum throbbed beneath the surface, whispering that something was amiss. Her students had returned, a flurry of awkward smiles and hesitant greetings, but something in their eyes – a flicker of doubt, perhaps – unsettled Amelia's carefully built world. The school bell would soon ring, shattering the quiet facade, but for now, Ms. Thorne stood still, waiting. Waiting for summer to end, waiting for the new year, and waiting for something... else entirely.
