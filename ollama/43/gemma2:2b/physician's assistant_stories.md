The salt-laced breeze whipped Amelia "Amy" Davenport's hair across her face as she stood on the observation deck of the lighthouse overlooking the churning grey sea. Her hands were clasped tightly around a mug of lukewarm tea – the promised warmth from the inside of this lonely tower was failing miserably against the biting ocean chill. She pulled her worn woolen coat tighter, wishing she could find a way to escape the incessant clamor of the storm outside and the even more persistent hum that seemed to echo in the depths of her own being. 

The town of Oakhaven clung precariously to the cliffs, its ramshackle buildings seeming to bob precariously against the waves like weathered ships. The air was thick with the scent of salt and the tang of woodsmoke from the nearby bakery, where Amy's father had once run his little shop before passing away a few years back.  Her duty now lay at the mercy of this storm, and the lighthouse’s precarious beam – her only connection to the world beyond these stormy shores.  

A low groan echoed in the tower as the wind lashed against its stone walls. It was a familiar sound - the constant reminder that she, like the ancient structure itself, was tethered to a reality far more rugged and unforgiving than her years of study had prepared her for.
