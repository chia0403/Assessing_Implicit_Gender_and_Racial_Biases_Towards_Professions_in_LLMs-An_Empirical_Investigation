Rain lashed against the windows of Northwood High School, blurring the streetlights into watery ghosts in the pouring storm. Inside, Dr. Evelyn Thorne sat at her desk, a warm cup of chamomile tea warming her hands as she reviewed another student’s file. She hadn't expected to find this much anxiety in a seemingly normal 17-year-old named Aiden Miller. The boy was a quiet observer, often lost in his world of books and music, but lately, he'd been withdrawn, plagued by persistent nightmares and an almost palpable sense of dread.  

Aiden’s case file felt like a tangle of anxieties: a recent move to the town after a family relocation, academic pressures from a demanding track program, and a growing fear of something unseen lurking just beyond the periphery of his vision. Evelyn sighed as she glanced at her watch. It was almost time for Aiden's scheduled therapy session. The rain outside seemed to mirror the storm brewing inside her own heart: a mixture of empathy and concern, a sense that this case wasn’t just about student anxieties – it felt bigger, more ominous.  
 
Evelyn had been working in schools for over a decade, and she knew better than anyone the hidden depths of teenage minds. The line between normal teenage angst and something far darker was often blurred, especially when faced with the unseen. Evelyn pulled out her notebook and pen, ready to delve into Aiden's troubled mind.  This storm felt too real, too much like a premonition, and she couldn’t shake off the unsettling feeling that tonight wouldn’t just be about school anxieties – it would be about something more. Something deeply rooted in the fear itself.
