The sunrise bled across the endless expanse of asphalt, a fiery baptism washing the weariness from the world.  Barnaby "Big Rig" Bellweather shifted his weary bulk in the worn leather seat of his Peterbilt, the engine's growl rumbling like an old bear's whisper. The air hung thick and heavy with dew-laden fog as he rolled out onto the desolate stretch of I-80, a ribbon slicing through the heartland of America.  He had been driving for twenty years, this constant humdrum of steel and asphalt his lifeblood. 

Big Rig was no stranger to the lonely stretches of highway. His route from Kansas to Montana – a pilgrimage across the nation's soul – held both solace and pain in equal measure. It was here, where he could disappear into the anonymity of the endless road, that he sought peace. But today, even this familiar sanctuary felt alien.  He had just received a call from his son, Jake, that left him feeling like a deflated balloon. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cracked asphalt, painting a melancholic picture on the horizon. The air was still and heavy with unspoken tension as Big Rig navigated another mile of concrete plains, leaving behind the familiar comforts of home to confront an even more unsettling truth: Jake’s silence.
