Rain hammered against the windowpanes of The Dusty Rose, each drop a tiny explosion in the otherwise silent diner.  The neon sign flickered its tired promise of comfort food and sleepy smiles through the downpour. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Harper hunched over a stack of menus, her hands trembling ever so slightly from the lukewarm coffee she was trying to finish.  It had been raining for days, the kind of storm that brought out everyone's worst quirks, except Amy's, which she swore were always magnified tenfold when it came to her customers' moods. 

The setting was a familiar one. The worn linoleum floor, the chipped paint on the walls, and the faded Formica tabletops - each held a story of its own.  Amy's world had become this diner, its routines and anxieties intertwined with hers since she started working here five years ago at the tender age of seventeen.
