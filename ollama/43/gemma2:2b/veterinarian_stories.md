## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's clinic, a rhythmic counterpoint to the anxious panting coming from inside. The air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and fear, an olfactory cocktail that Elias found both familiar and repulsive. He smoothed down his worn lab coat, feeling the rough texture under his fingers as if tracing a lifeline through the storm outside. 

His patient was a husky named Frost, a beautiful creature with eyes the color of winter ice and fur so thick it needed constant brushing. Today, however, even Elias's usual calm couldn’t quell the anxiety swirling within him. Frost had been brought in by his owner, Mrs. Anderson, after an alarming series of episodes that left her elderly dog whimpering in pain and confused. 

The tiny town of Oakhaven, nestled amongst rolling hills and whispering oaks, seemed to shrink beneath the storm clouds, mirroring the unease building inside Elias. He took a deep breath, adjusting his glasses as he looked at Frost's trembling body, his own reflection staring back from the steel bowl beside him. The storm wasn’t just outside; it was within, brewing like an untamed wildcat, waiting to erupt.
