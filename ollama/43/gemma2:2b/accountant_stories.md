The neon hum of the city bled into the sterile white walls of Harold's office. His desk gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights, an orchestra of numbers flashing to life on his computer screen:  a symphony of spreadsheets and tax forms that seemed to mock him with their precision. Harold, a man whose mind ran as smoothly as the gears in his trusty 1980s calculator, had dedicated his entire life to understanding the language of money, a language he felt increasingly alienated from. Tonight, however, was different. A faint hum vibrated through the office floorboards, an inexplicable tremor that only seemed to intensify with every passing minute. 

The air itself crackled with a strange energy, the usual chaos of his city seeming to amplify itself into something... more.  Harold rubbed his eyes, attempting to shake off the unsettling sensation, yet it lingered like a phantom limb. The hum had intensified, now accompanied by an eerie blue glow emanating from his computer screen. This was no longer just numbers; this was something...different.

**Setting:** A bustling city at night, with neon signs blinking and traffic rushing past. 
**Main Character:** Harold Finchson, a meticulous accountant whose life revolved around the precision of numbers.
