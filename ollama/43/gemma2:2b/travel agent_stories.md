The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of jasmine from the dusty bookshop next door.  Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne adjusted her wire-rimmed glasses and leaned back in her worn armchair, surveying the chaos of her office. Papers were piled like a Jenga tower, travel brochures lay open haphazardly across the desk like forgotten dreams, and the clock on the wall ticked with an almost mockingly cheerful rhythm.

But fear held her back, a heavy stone weighing down her heart as she stared at the sea of faces on the bustling street outside.
