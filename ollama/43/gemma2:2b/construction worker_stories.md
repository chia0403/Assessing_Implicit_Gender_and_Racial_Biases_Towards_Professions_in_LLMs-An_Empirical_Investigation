The morning air was thick with the metallic tang of rust and exhaust fumes, clinging to Michael "Mac" McMillan like an unwelcome blanket. He hated this part of his job - the early mornings, the pre-dawn darkness that seemed to seep into your bones as you shifted through dusty piles of wood and metal scraps.  He took a swig from his thermos – lukewarm coffee and a stale cigarette – hoping for some semblance of warmth.  His gaze fell upon the towering scaffolding behind him, skeletal fingers scraping against the bruised sky. 

It was a project he’d been assigned to by the grumpy old foreman, Mr. Collins: an office building on the edge of town that promised a new life after years of struggling through dry patches and dead-end jobs.  Collins believed this job would be Mac's ticket out of his own slump, out of the endless cycle of broken promises and unfulfilled dreams. He hoped to see the same flicker of determination in Mac’s eyes he saw in himself back when he started out. 

The city was waking up around them – a symphony of horns and clattering wheels, as if the very buildings themselves were breathing.  But for Mac, there was only silence - the kind that pressed on him like a suffocating blanket, punctuated by the constant creak of metal and the echo of his own weary footsteps.

**Main Character:** Michael "Mac" McMillan - a skilled but hard-worn construction worker, seeking to rebuild his life.  His eyes show the weight of his past struggles and unfulfilled dreams.
