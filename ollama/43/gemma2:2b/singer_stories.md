The salty air whipped Elara's hair around her face as she stood on the rickety pier of Isla del Mar. The sun was dipping behind the horizon, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and violet that mirrored the emotions swirling inside her. Elara was no stranger to the ocean; it was her lifeblood, her source of inspiration.  Her voice, a cascade of notes that seemed to carry the secrets of the waves themselves, had graced countless stages across the world - but tonight, on this remote island off the coast of Italy, she felt raw, exposed, like an untamed sea creature caught in a net. 

Tonight was her first solo performance in years, and something about the vastness of the sky and the gentle rocking of the waves underfoot stirred up a lifetime's worth of anxieties. Tonight, she wasn't just singing for the cheering crowds or even her adoring fans; tonight, she was singing to herself - an untamed, raw confession of love lost and dreams left behind.  As the last sliver of sun dipped beneath the horizon, Elara took a deep breath and adjusted the microphone, its cold metal feeling strangely comforting in her hands. The crowd was gathering on the beach, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of oil lamps, and a silent wave of anticipation washed over Elara. She began to sing.
