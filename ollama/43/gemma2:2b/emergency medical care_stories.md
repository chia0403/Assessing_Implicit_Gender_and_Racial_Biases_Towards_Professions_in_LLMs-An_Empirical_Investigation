The neon glow of the city reflected in Dr. Alistair Finch's steely blue eyes as he surveyed the sprawling chaos of the night.  He had been called to this desolate patch of Chicago for a routine call.  It was supposed to be simple; a fractured wrist, maybe a heart attack in an elderly lady. But sometimes, even within the confines of his carefully ordered world of emergency medicine, the unpredictable could throw you off course. 

The air was thick with exhaust fumes and the lingering scent of burnt hot dogs from last night's street vendors.  His ambulance, a battered relic with more miles than he cared to remember, screeched to a stop on a rain-slicked side street.   The rhythmic beeping of its alarm echoed through the oppressive air as Alistair got out, his boots crunching on gravel and spitting up water like a trapped bird. His patient's plight waited for him - an elderly woman with glassy eyes, her frail body slumped against a dilapidated fire escape.  He knew what awaited him: not just another emergency call, but a chance to be the hand that held someone through their most vulnerable moment. 


Alistair’s face tightened as he reached for his satchel, ready to dive into the storm of pain and fear that was about to unfold. His name wasn't all there was to him though -  it was just one part of the story of the man who would be called on to save lives in the darkest hours.
