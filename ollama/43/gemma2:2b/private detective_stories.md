Rain hammered against the grimy glass of Detective Silas Thorne's office window, mirroring the storm brewing in his gut. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation - two smells he was intimately familiar with after years spent wading through the city's underbelly. He adjusted his collar, a worn brown tweed that concealed an arsenal of secrets himself.  

Outside, the neon glow of "The Lucky Shamrock" bar pulsed like a throbbing heart, tempting him with the promise of easy-going companionship and perhaps a bit of illicit information. But tonight, Silas was hunting ghosts. Not literal ghosts, but the kind haunting his client's mind: the ghost of a lost love gone missing. 

**Character:** Silas Thorne 
**Setting:**  New York City, late October - a time when the cityâ€™s soul seemed to shift from summer's carefree dance to autumn's melancholic waltz. The air was sharp with frost and anticipation of winter's looming presence.  The rain-slick streets echoed his internal turmoil as he stood at his windowsill, preparing for what promised to be a night of unraveling truth.
