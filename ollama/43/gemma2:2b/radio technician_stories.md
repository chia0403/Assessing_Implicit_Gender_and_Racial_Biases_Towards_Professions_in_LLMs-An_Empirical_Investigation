The hum of the old transmitter was almost as familiar as Amelia's own heartbeat, a comforting rhythm in the otherwise deafening silence of the abandoned coastal town. Salt spray clung to her worn coat like memories of better days.  Amelia, the station’s only resident and its sole operator, adjusted the dials on her vintage radio gear with practiced ease, her nimble fingers tracing over the faded lettering on the knobs. The storm raged outside, a symphony of howling wind and crashing waves that seemed to echo the turmoil in her own heart. 

Her gaze drifted towards the jagged silhouette of the lighthouse against the grey canvas of the sky. It was a beacon of hope, an old friend, a reminder that even in the darkest storms, there was light to be found. Yet today, its light felt like a mocking glare, highlighting the desolation that had become her life's reality. Five years ago, she’d been the one who brought the town back from the brink, using her talent and knowledge to rebuild the radio station, now the only source of communication for miles around. But lately, even that connection had frayed at the edges, leaving a bitter taste on her tongue.  Her hopes were dwindling, replaced by an overwhelming sense of isolation, like being trapped within the rusted frame of the town's abandoned history.

With a sigh she turned back to the radio, fingers tightening around the control panel, ready to call out into the abyss, hoping for any sign of life in the static wilderness that was her only connection to the world beyond the storm.
