## The Rustle in the Wheat

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Silas Hawthorne's farm, turning the already golden wheat fields into shimmering mosaics. He squinted through the haze, his weathered hand resting on the worn handle of his scythe.  A low moan escaped his lips as he surveyed the vast expanse – a symphony of rustle and sway in the wind that whispered through the stalks. It was a sound he knew intimately, one woven into the very fabric of his life. 

Silas Hawthorne wasn’t just a farmer; he was the guardian of this land, its weathered soul intertwined with his own. His family had tilled these fields for generations, passing down wisdom and hardship through stories whispered on cold winter nights.  But this year, something felt different. A gnawing unease hummed beneath the idyllic surface. 

The sun dipped lower, casting long, eerie shadows that stretched across the field like skeletal fingers. The wind picked up, whistling a mournful tune as it stirred the wheat, sending a shiver down Silas's spine.  He felt eyes on him - unseen, yet somehow palpable. His heart pounded a wild rhythm against his ribs, and he swore he heard something rustle at the edge of the field. A deep sense of dread crept into his bones. This was no ordinary breeze.
