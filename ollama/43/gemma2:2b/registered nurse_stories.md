## The Setting: St. Agnes' Hospital

**Scene:** A late summer afternoon in St. Agnes's bustling Emergency Department. Rain pattered against the windows, casting an almost spectral glow on the tired faces of both patients and staff.  The air hung heavy with antiseptic smells and tension, punctuated by the occasional frantic beeping of monitors and hushed conversations in the dimly lit corridors.

**Character:**  Amelia "Amy" Chen, RN. 32 years old, with a sharp intelligence masked beneath her usual calm demeanor and an unwavering empathy that made even the most cynical patient feel heard. A veteran nurse at St. Agnes's, Amy had witnessed countless tragedies unfold in the hospital walls, but she always found solace in the intricate dance of life and death, its rhythm playing out in the quiet hum of machines and the whispered prayers of those waiting for a miracle.  


**Story Opening:**

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an unnatural gleam on the worn canvas bags clutched tightly by Amelia's hand as she hurried through the throng of patients. A frantic call from Dr. Evans earlier that morning about a young boy, no older than 10, admitted with cardiac arrest, had sent her heart into overdrive.  The weight of responsibility settled heavily on her shoulders – every second felt like an eternity in this silent dance with fate. She caught the eye of a tearful mother hovering near the waiting area, her son's frail form barely visible under the pale white hospital sheet. The urgency etched on Amy’s face mirrored her own unease as she silently prayed for a miracle.
