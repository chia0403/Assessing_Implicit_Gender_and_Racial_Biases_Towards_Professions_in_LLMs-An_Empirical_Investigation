The air hung thick and humid, clinging to Reginald "Reg" Hawthorne like a second skin as he surveyed his domain. The sprawling Victorian estate of Elderwood Manor was bathed in the fading light of dusk, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns that stretched towards the distant horizon. It was supposed to be idyllic: rows of perfectly pruned roses, shimmering fountains cascading music into the air, and a scent of fresh-cut grass carried on the evening breeze. But for Reg, it felt like an eternity spent within the gilded cage of the wealthy's whims.  

Reg wasn't built for elegance or opulence. He was a simple man, his calloused hands more accustomed to wielding a rake than holding a champagne flute. Years of tending the sprawling grounds had carved lines deep into his face, each one etched with the silent stories of every season, every storm, every wilting bloom.  He was a solitary figure within this vibrant world of polished wood and glittering chandeliers, often found lost in the labyrinthine depths of the estate, his boots kicking up dust and leaves, his soul yearning for the solace of simple earth. 


**Setting:** Elderwood Manor - A sprawling Victorian estate surrounded by rolling hills and lush gardens in a small town near the coast.
