The air hung thick and stagnant in the Texas heat, laced with the smell of diesel and dust that clung to everything.  A haze settled over the gravel yard like fog rolling off a mountain range.  Even under the wide-brimmed hat perched on his brow, Thomas "Stone" Callahan could feel the sweat prickling at his hairline. He ran a calloused thumb across the dented paint of his 40-ton Bulldozer, its engine a low rumble that vibrated through his bones. Today was Demolition Day in Dustbowl County, and Stone, like many before him, was built to handle it.  

Dustbowl County wasn't a name anyone chose; it clung to them like a curse born from generations of hard labor and dust storms that swallowed the plains whole. A place where men wrestled with mountains of metal and earth for a meager life, where time moved at its own erratic pace, and where the unforgiving desert sun blazed down relentlessly, painting everything in shades of ochre and rust. Stone was one of those men, his name synonymous with raw strength and quiet grit.

He wiped his forehead, the sweat stinging his eyes.  Today was a special day; this was his last job before heading west to California for an unknown opportunity that promised sunshine and more than just dust storms. He looked at his weathered hands, calloused and strong from years of hard work.  They held the weight of countless bulldozers, each leaving their mark on him like the scars of a lifetime lived under the unforgiving Texas sky.  The sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the yard.  Stone felt a familiar knot of anticipation tightening in his gut. He was ready for this job to unfold and leave its own unique mark on him.
