The morning mist clung to Willow Creek like a damp blanket, clinging to the old oaks that lined the path leading to Oakhaven Orphanage. The air was thick with the earthy smell of wet leaves and the faint, sweet scent of honeysuckle from the rose bushes bordering the entrance.  Inside the orphanage's walls, 17-year-old Amelia "Amy" Foster bustled around, her worn leather apron flapping against her knees as she fed the resident animals. 

Her favorite was Clover, a mischievous black and white kitten with eyes like polished obsidian, who would often bat at Amy’s fingers as she passed.  Today, however, Clover’s usual playful demeanor had been replaced by an air of worry, leaving Amy wondering if something was amiss. This quiet concern was amplified by the hushed voices that echoed from the orphanage's central hall, each word a silent storm brewing around her.
