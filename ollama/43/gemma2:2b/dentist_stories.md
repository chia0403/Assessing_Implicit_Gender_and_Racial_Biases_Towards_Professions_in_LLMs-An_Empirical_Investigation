The morning air in Maple Grove was as thick and sticky as last week's gumbo stew. It clung to Dr. Alistair Crane’s worn leather coat and dampened his already-dampened soul.  Dr. Crane, with his kind face hidden behind the ever-present spectacles, stared across his office at the overflowing trashcan in the corner - a testament to Maple Grove's peculiar blend of dental mishaps and unyielding societal standards. The only sounds were the whirring of his old drill and the faint hum of an ancient radio playing a mournful blues song.

The setting was as much about decay as it was about resilience.  Maple Grove, a quaint town nestled in the heart of Mississippi's Delta, wasn’t known for its fancy smiles or gleaming teeth.  It was a place where time seemed to have stopped, and where tradition ran deeper than the muddy creeks that meandered through the surrounding fields. 

Dr. Crane, a man steeped in the traditions of his small town, was more than just a dentist. He was the keeper of Maple Grove's oral history - the guardian of its teeth-stained secrets. He was burdened by their memories and burdened by their unspoken expectations, but still held onto them like the last wisp of smoke from an old cigar.
