The old Victorian house behind him stood skeletal against the bruised twilight sky, a monument to yesterday's rage, its charred remains a stark reminder of the ever-present threat lurking within every flickering ember. 

Elias knelt beside the wreckage of a child’s bedroom, his boots squelching on the damp earth as he sifted through rubble, the echo of sirens growing fainter with each passing moment. The fire had ripped through this once joyful home in the blink of an eye, leaving only charred toys and shattered dreams. It was the kind of disaster that etched itself onto your soul – a raw wound of grief and loss.

His pulse quickened with an ache he couldn’t quite name. He knew this house. He knew Sophie's mother, Mrs. Miller, who had been out running errands when the inferno erupted. She was still missing.
