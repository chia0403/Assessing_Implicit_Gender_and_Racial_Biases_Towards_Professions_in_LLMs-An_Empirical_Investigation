The wind whipped around Elias Thorne's thick beard, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and wet asphalt. He squinted at the sky, its bruised purple hues mirroring the storm brewing on the horizon. Rain was coming down in sheets, already turning the familiar gravel driveway into a swirling river. 

Elias had spent his life working from the rooftops. From that vantage point, he could see more than just the houses; he saw the city’s pulse – its anxieties, its dreams, and its hidden struggles laid bare like exposed wiring beneath the shingles. He was “High Sky” Elias, as some called him, a nickname born from his ability to work with unparalleled grace and precision on the most challenging of structures.

Tonight, however, he wasn't tackling anything spectacular. Just another leaky roof for Mrs. Peters – a woman known for her sharp tongue and even sharper knitting needles, always leaving a trail of passive-aggressive comments as Elias maneuvered between rafters. The kind of job that felt like a chore more than an art form. But there was something comforting in the routine, a rhythm to his work, and tonight, even amidst the storm, Elias found himself oddly serene.
