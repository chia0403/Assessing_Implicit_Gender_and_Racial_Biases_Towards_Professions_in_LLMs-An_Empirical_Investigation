## Story Opening:

Rain hammered against the bakery windows, blurring the quaint French village into an impressionistic watercolour.  The aroma of fresh croissants and pain au chocolat battled against the damp chill seeping in through the cracks. Inside, Eloise Moreau, RD, her name stitched neatly onto her starched apron, sighed as she straightened a row of meticulously arranged sugar cookies on display. 

Eloise wasn't one for melancholy. Her life was a symphony of baking flour and vibrant colours â€“  the world felt brighter with each sprinkle of cinnamon, each smooth fold of dough. But tonight, the storm outside mirrored the turbulence brewing inside her. The bakery had been bustling this week, but not a single order had reached its usual destination: the hospital cafeteria. 

The hospital had become synonymous with Eloise's heart and soul. It was where she'd helped countless patients navigate their dietary restrictions, finding solace in nourishing their bodies. But now, the once-proud institution felt shrouded in an ominous silence. The funding cut was a cruel blow, leaving her colleagues scrambling to maintain the fragile network of meals they were tasked with delivering.
