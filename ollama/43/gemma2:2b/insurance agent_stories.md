The afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of Arthur "Art" Pendleton's office, illuminating motes dancing in the air like fallen stars. Outside, the city of New Salem hummed with a quiet energy as commuters hurried home after work. The scent of old paper and freshly brewed coffee permeated the air, creating a comforting, if slightly unsettling, aroma that Art found himself strangely at ease with. 

Art was a man of routine. Every day, he'd sit in his worn leather chair, sip his lukewarm coffee, sift through stacks of policy documents, and meticulously calculate every possible loss scenario. His office had witnessed countless tragedies – car accidents, floods, fires – all recorded on dusty pages within these walls. But it was a quiet, almost peaceful sort of tragedy that troubled him most.  

His current client, Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne, sat across from Art, her hands clasped tightly in her lap as she stared at the floorboards with an air of anxious resignation. The news had been delivered like an unwelcome guest: a long-standing claim for homeowner's insurance, stemming from decades of neglect that had finally turned catastrophic. Her house was on the verge of collapse. Art sighed and pulled out a faded photograph from his file.
