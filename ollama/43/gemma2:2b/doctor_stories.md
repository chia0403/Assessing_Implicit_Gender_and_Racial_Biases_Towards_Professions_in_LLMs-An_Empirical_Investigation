The salt-laced wind whipped Elara's hair across her face as she stood at the edge of the pier, watching the crimson sun bleed into the horizon.  Her white coat, already damp from the lingering spray of the ocean, seemed to blend with the sky itself.  She was Dr. Elara Moreau, a renowned marine biologist and doctor, stationed on the isolated island of Avalon off the coast of Greenland. A place where whispers danced on the wind and myths clung to the rugged shores like barnacles. Today, however, she wasn't thinking about the mythical folklore. Instead, her mind was consumed by the grim report in her hand – a collection of unsettling symptoms from one of her routine check-ups. 

The patient, old Mr. Kjaer, hadn’t been himself lately. The usual stoicism replaced with a growing anxiety that seeped into his words and left Elara feeling like she was navigating uncharted waters.  He spoke of shadows appearing at the edge of his vision, dreams of vast, silent oceans swallowing him whole, and a strange metallic taste in his mouth. He said it felt like…a call from something deep within the Earth’s crust, urging him to find it, find the source. 

As Elara stared out at the endless expanse of water, the sun dipping below the horizon, she knew this case was about more than just a change in routine; it was about unraveling a mystery that might very well redefine her understanding of both life and death itself. This was an invitation to dive into the unknown depths of Avalon's secrets - secrets whispered on the wind and etched onto the faces of those who dared to explore them.
