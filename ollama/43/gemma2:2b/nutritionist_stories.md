## Story Opening: A Salad Song

**Setting:**  A bustling farmers' market in sunny Santa Monica, California. Vibrant flowers spill out of overflowing baskets, their scent mingling with the sizzling aroma of fresh-off-the-grill fish tacos and the earthy tang of freshly squeezed lemonade. Sunlight bathes the lively scene in an incandescent glow, yet a melancholic air lingers around Evelyn "Evie" Thorne's stall.

**Evelyn Thorne**, her name as delicate as the heirloom tomatoes she arranges with meticulous care, stands beside her meticulously crafted salads, each one a testament to her expertise. She wears a worn apron over a faded sundress and carries an aura of quiet strength, her hazel eyes crinkling at the corners when she smiles at the customers. But there's something unsettlingly quiet about this normally sunny morning. A strange tension hangs in the air, amplified by the mournful melody emanating from a nearby jazz band playing a bluesy tune.

The words "This market never feels quite…right" slip out of Evie’s lips as she watches the crowd trickle past her stall.  Is it the melancholy mood? The lackluster sales compared to last week? Or perhaps, something more sinister lurking in this idyllic scene? A shadow falls over Evie's booth. 

“You looking for something special today?” a low voice asks. Her gaze meets those of a man with piercing blue eyes and a worn fedora pulled low over his forehead. His smile is enigmatic, almost predatory.  His words echo the unspoken tension in the air – "Something special" in this place where sunshine and salads shouldn't clash so terribly.
