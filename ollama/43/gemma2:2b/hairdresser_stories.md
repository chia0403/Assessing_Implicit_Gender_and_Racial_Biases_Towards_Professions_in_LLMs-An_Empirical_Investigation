The air hung thick with the scent of hairspray and coconut shampoo as  Amelia "Amy" Rivers meticulously dried Amelia's lavender-infused hair. The salon was a vibrant kaleidoscope of color - emerald green chairs nestled next to ruby red ones, all framed by a curtain of cascading ferns that seemed to whisper secrets in the breeze. It was 10:00 am, the quiet hum of the morning rush just beginning to kick in. 

Amy’s fingers traced the smooth surface of Amelia's platinum blonde bob as she smiled. "Ready for your new look?" She asked softly, leaning down to get a better look at her client's reflection in the mirror. The salon was more than just a place to trim hair and apply bleach; it was a refuge, a haven where time stood still, and Amelia’s creativity could truly bloom.  

But today, something felt off. The usual buzz of anticipation seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling quiet. A lone butterfly, its wings the color of burnt orange, fluttered past Amy's window before disappearing into the overgrown garden beyond the salon doors. Was it just her imagination? Or was there a shift in the air, an undercurrent of something different that had even Amelia’s usual sharp-witted sense of observation stumped?
