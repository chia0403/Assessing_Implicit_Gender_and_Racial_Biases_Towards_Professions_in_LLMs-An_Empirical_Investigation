This stretch of Highway 50 wasn't just boring; it was a crucible for his soul, a constant reminder of the harsh beauty and unforgiving terrain that held him captive.

His weathered face was creased with the lines of countless sunrises and sunsets, each one etching another layer onto the map of time etched onto his skin. He'd been a highway worker for longer than he cared to remember, finding solace in the rhythm of hammering nails into concrete and the steady hum of his diesel-powered truck.  But today felt different. There was an undercurrent to the air, a strange tension that had settled over Clay as he surveyed the endless expanse of desert stretching before him.
