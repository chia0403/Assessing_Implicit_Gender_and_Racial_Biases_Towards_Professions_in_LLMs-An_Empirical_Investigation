The first snowflakes of winter clung to the pine needles like forgotten memories.  Old Man Blackwood, his weathered face framed by a thick beard the color of dried mud, tightened his grip on his axe, its handle slick from years of use.  His name was as imposing as the mountains that cradled him, echoing with generations of logging families who'd carved their destinies into the very timber he felled.  Blackwood himself had lived and breathed the forest his whole life, each bark whispering secrets only he could hear. This time, however, something felt different. A chill wind whistled through the towering pines, a melody that sounded strangely foreboding in the stillness of the woods. 

He stood at the edge of what was once the heart of Blackwood's own family land - now a quiet testament to a legacy passed down through generations.  For years, his hands had felled giants, but now, he looked across the clearing and felt a tremor of fear.  His eyes were drawn to a lone figure perched on a treetop, their silhouette stark against the dying light of the setting sun.
