The mahogany courtroom was thick with the scent of old wood and stale coffee. Judge Eleanor Vance, her silver hair pulled back in a severe bun, surveyed the room from behind her raised bench. Sunlight slanted through the stained glass window across the far wall, illuminating dust motes swirling like tiny dancers in the air. Outside, a summer storm raged – wind howled, rain lashed against the glass, and the distant thunder grumbled with barely contained power. But inside, the courtroom was silent, save for the rhythmic tapping of Judge Vance's heavy boots on the polished floorboards as she waited for her next case to begin. 

The air hung thick with tension, not just from the storm outside but also from the two men seated in opposing counsel chairs: a hulking man with a shaved head and steely gaze, Marcus "Hammer" Thorne, representing the prosecution; and Ethan Sterling, his face ashen and drawn, defending the accused – a young artist named Jasper Thorne, son of Marcus's rival.
