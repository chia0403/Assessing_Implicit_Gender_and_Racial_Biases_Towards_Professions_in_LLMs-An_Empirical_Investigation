The late afternoon sun dripped through the dusty blinds of Amelia Thorne's office, casting long, golden shadows across the worn carpet. It wasn't the kind of sunlight that sparked joy in most people's hearts, but it felt familiar to Amelia – an almost comforting reminder of the quiet routine she'd clung to for years.  She adjusted her glasses and ran a hand through her unruly blonde hair, sighing as she stared at a half-written listing on her computer screen.

**Setting:** Amelia Thorne's real estate agency in the quaint, yet fading coastal town of Saltwind Cove. 
* **The charm:** The agency was nestled amongst the historic brick buildings and cobbled streets that had stood since the days when salty sea dogs traded tales over their mugs of grog.
* **The decline:** However, Saltwind Cove's glory days were long gone. The once bustling port now seemed to be drifting into an endless summer, a victim of both time and an economy that prioritized progress and efficiency. 

**Character:** Amelia Thorne


Amelia had always felt like an anachronism in this town.  Her heritage was old-money New England – her grandfather had been the mayor, his legacy woven into Saltwind's history as intricately as the ivy clinging to the old stone building she now worked from. But Amelia yearned for something more than just maintaining that lineage; she dreamed of reshaping Saltwind’s future, one house at a time.  But with each passing day, the weight of the town's fading charm seemed heavier, its dreams as lost and forgotten as the tide. 


Now, her current client - Mrs. Peabody, a sweet old widow whose family home stood on the precipice of becoming another casualty of Saltwind's slow decay - needed Amelia’s touch more than ever.  She was determined to sell, but she couldn't shake off a nagging feeling that there was something bigger at play within this charming yet crumbling town.
