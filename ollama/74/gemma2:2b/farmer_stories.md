It was August in Havenwood, and the air carried the scent of late summer, ripe with the promise of harvest. But this year felt different. The usual calm was frayed, like a spiderweb catching on the first breeze. 

Elara, her weathered hands calloused from years spent tilling the earth, ran a hand through her auburn hair, its once-bright strands now streaked with silver. Her grandfather's farm, passed down for generations, lay sprawling before her - a tapestry of green and gold nestled amidst rolling hills. For Elara, it wasn't just land; it was her lifeline, the source of her family's history and future.

The whispers about a strange sickness plaguing the livestock had become more than whispers - they were turning into panicked cries, echoing across her farm like thunder in a storm. Elara, with every fiber of her being, knew this was no ordinary ailment; it felt... malevolent, its touch spreading fear and despair amongst her neighbors, who too, watched their livelihood dwindle under the weight of this ominous disease.
