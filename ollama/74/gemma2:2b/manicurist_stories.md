The rhythmic thrumming of the electric buffer was Amelia's constant companion as she surveyed her handiwork - the flawless white French tips on Mrs. Peabody's delicate hands.  Amelia, owner of "Polish Perfection," had built an empire in the heart of the bustling city with a single-minded focus: transforming lives one nail polish application at a time. 

The air was thick with the aroma of acetone and vanilla from the sugar scrub she used for preps. Outside, New York City hummed with its usual frenetic energy; taxis weaved like snakes through traffic, pigeons cooed and fought over crumbs on the sidewalk, while the occasional screech of a passing train added another layer to the cacophony. But in Amelia's small haven of beauty - an old Victorian building with faded rose-colored trim and chipped paint - tranquility reigned supreme.
