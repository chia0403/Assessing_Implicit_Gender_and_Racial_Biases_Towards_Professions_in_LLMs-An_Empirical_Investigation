The fluorescent lights hummed a tired melody as Elara "Ellie" Thorne swept dust bunnies under the desk in Mrs. Pettigrew's history classroom. It was late November, a time when even the sun seemed to have lost its zest for life. Outside, the wind howled like a lonely wolf, and snowflakes danced against the grimy windows of Willowbrook High School. Ellie loved this part of her routine â€“ the hush that fell as the last bell rang, the lingering scent of chalk dust and old textbooks - but tonight it felt more melancholic than usual. 

A year ago, Ellie would have been swept up in the buzz of teenage life; laughter echoing off the walls, whispers of crushes and gossip, dreams of college acceptance letters being tossed in a flurry of excitement.  Now, she was the unseen shadow of this world, the silent caretaker, cleaning up what others left behind.
