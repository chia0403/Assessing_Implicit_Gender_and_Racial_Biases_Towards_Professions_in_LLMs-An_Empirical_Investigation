The mahogany desk gleamed under the harsh fluorescent light, reflecting back the steely eyes of Amelia Thorne.  Her immaculately tailored suit, an off-white that seemed to vanish against the dark wood, hugged her frame as she sat ramrod straight. The city outside was a cacophony - sirens wailing, car horns blaring, construction crews hammering away on something somewhere. Inside, though, it felt like the world had stopped, compressed into the small rectangle of Amelia's vision. A single line of text flickered across her monitor: **$140 million lost.** 

Amelia Thorne wasn’t just a stock broker; she was known for being ruthless in the face of market turbulence. This morning’s storm, however, had brought out the monster within Amelia, churning her gut with a familiar, sickening dread. She could feel the weight of a thousand eyes watching as the numbers on her screen continued to dwindle, each tick a painful reminder of her impending downfall. 


**Setting:**  A prestigious Manhattan investment firm; The Thorne Group. A stark minimalist office, dominated by sleek black desks, metallic screens that pulsed with data, and the faint hum of servers, a silent symphony of finance.
