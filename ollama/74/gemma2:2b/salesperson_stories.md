The air in "Sunshine Sales" was thick with the scent of overheated ozone and despair.  Sunlight streamed through the grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing on the worn carpet. It felt like every inch of the place held stories – tales whispered by countless unhappy customers, each clutching their last shred of hope as they shuffled out into the harsh reality of a world that seemed determined to leave them in the shade.  This was where Elias Thorne worked his magic, or at least tried to. A man whose smile could charm even the most jaded cynic, he believed, deep down, in the inherent goodness of every customer and their potential for joy. 

Elias was known as "Eli" by everyone who crossed his path, a nickname earned after years of navigating the treacherous waters of consumer psychology, offering sunshine to customers with an aura thicker than even the air conditioning struggling to keep up in this sweltering metropolis. His job wasn’t easy -  selling anything from humble paper products to high-falutin' laser printers. Today, he was tasked with selling a new line of self-heating coffee mugs to a group of disillusioned office workers who had just witnessed the latest corporate downsizing announcement. He sat down at his desk – worn leather and sticky-sweet remnants of last week’s batch of sugar cookies – ready for another day in the crucible of consumerism.
