The air hung heavy with salt spray and the stench of fish guts as Silas, known amongst the crew as "Silas the Steady," patrolled the deck of the 'Sea Serpent'. His boots crunched on the uneven planks, each step echoing in the near-deafening roar of the wind whipping off the open ocean. He was a veteran, his weathered face etched with years of sun and sea, every line telling a story of battles won and storms weathered. Tonight, though, the air buzzed with a different kind of tension. Tonight, the Sea Serpent was on the cusp of something momentous - their first full moon voyage since the return from the cursed isle.

Silas' eyes narrowed as he scanned the horizon. The crimson glow of the setting sun bled into the inky black canvas, painting the water a bruised purple before being swallowed by the moon’s luminous embrace. He had seen this light before, witnessed its power to both inspire and terrify. Tonight, it held a special weight. Not just because of the voyage's significance, but because tonight marked the night they would test their legend - the legendary talisman, The Keeper, believed to hold the key to unlocking true prosperity in the face of danger. 

The Sea Serpent wasn’t built for riches; it was built for survival. But within its weathered timbers lay a history steeped in hardship and resilience –  a history that Silas knew better than anyone. He held his weathered hands close to his heart, his gaze fixed upon the moon. Tonight, the fate of their voyage, and maybe even their souls, rested in the delicate balance between hope and fear.
