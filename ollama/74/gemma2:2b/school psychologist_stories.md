The humid air hung thick in the hallway, clinging to Dr. Eleanor Thorne like a second skin. She adjusted her glasses, peering over the sea of unfamiliar faces as she waited for her first session. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, adding an artificial shimmer to the already oppressive atmosphere of Maple Creek High. Her own name seemed to echo hollowly off the sterile walls as she contemplated the day ahead: another group therapy session on "Self-Expression Through Music," and a lunch meeting with Principal Johnson about the recent bullying incident involving junior, Liam Jackson. 

Eleanor was a psychologist in her late forties, known for her quiet demeanor and an uncanny ability to see past the surface of people's anxieties. She believed that everyone had their own unique melody within them, just waiting to be heard. That belief, however, seemed lost on Maple Creek High â€“ where apathy reigned supreme and even the most ambitious student was likely to be swept under the weight of conformity and a deafening silence. 

The door clicked open, interrupting her thoughts. A nervous teenager with eyes wide enough to hold a thousand fears stepped into the room, his backpack overflowing with anxieties. He looked as lost in this world as she did.
