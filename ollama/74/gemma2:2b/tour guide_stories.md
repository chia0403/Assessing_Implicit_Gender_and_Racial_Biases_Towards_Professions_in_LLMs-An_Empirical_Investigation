The sun beat down on Elara's worn face as she stood before her tour group at the foot of the ancient ruins of Aethelgar, nestled deep within the heart of the whispering woods. The air hummed with anticipation, thick with moisture and the scent of pine needles. Today was a particularly special day - their visit to the legendary Whispering Stones, said to hold secrets older than time itself. 

Elara adjusted her weathered travel hat, smoothing out the wrinkles on its brim with a tired smile. For years, she'd walked these very stones, leading tours through the crumbling grandeur of Aethelgar. But today felt different. The air crackled with an energy that sent chills down her spine. It wasn’t just the sun; something shifted as they stepped closer to the entrance of the stone archway, a swirling mist coalescing around them like a phantom embrace. 

Her heart hammered in her chest. Elara was no stranger to whispers - but this felt different, almost…alive.  "This place holds secrets," she announced, her voice barely audible above the rustle of leaves and the gurgling of an unseen stream. "Secrets that call out to those who dare listen." 


**Setting:** Aethelgar is a once-grand city now reduced to crumbling ruins, nestled deep within a mystical forest. The towering stone archway leading to the Whispering Stones hums with ancient energy and whispers promises of lost knowledge.

**Character:** Elara Thorne - a seasoned tour guide who carries stories of Aethelgar's past in her every step.
