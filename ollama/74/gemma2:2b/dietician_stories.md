The air hung thick with the scent of citrus blossoms and something vaguely metallic – the smell of hope mixed with the sharp tang of fear.  Dr. Amelia Hayes, her auburn hair pulled back tight in a bun to keep it out of her face as she scrubbed at the countertop, wasn't sure what was more unsettling – the way the hospital lights danced on the peeling paint of the kitchen or the news reports playing silently on the television next to the sink.

Amelia sighed, running a hand through her dry, wind-whipped hair. The bustling city outside had seemed almost festive just hours ago, but now, even the cheery yellow cabs and the distant chatter of the marketplace felt ominous. It was the fourth anniversary of Mrs. Petrov's last appointment with Amelia – a woman who had been battling cancer like a wild beast for two years, leaving a trail of fear in her wake.  The news announced, in stark black text against an otherwise vibrant screen, that Mrs. Petrov was now gone, claimed by the same disease that had plagued her for so long. 

Amelia’s eyes narrowed as she remembered Mrs. Petrov's last desperate plea: "There's got to be something else… a cure. Anything!" The weight of Mrs. Petrov's fear, a constant shadow even after her death, settled heavily on Amelia’s shoulders.  The question gnawed at her – what if there *wasn't* anything else? What if this was just another chapter in the cruelest story humanity had ever written?
