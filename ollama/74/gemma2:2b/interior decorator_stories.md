## Story Opening: The Velvet Cage

**Setting:**  A cobblestone alley in Montmartre, Paris. 
The air hangs heavy with cigarette smoke, the scent of freshly baked bread from a nearby boulangerie mingling with the faint hum of street musicians. Rain patters against the grimy brick walls, creating an ethereal rhythm that echoes through the narrow passage. A lone lamp casts a sickly yellow glow on the worn cobblestones.

**Character:**  Name: **Eloise Moreau**, 28, a renowned interior decorator known for her ability to transform ordinary spaces into elegant masterpieces. 

Eloise, perched precariously on a rickety metal stool beneath a flickering gas lamp, observes the world go by with an aloof air. Her hands, adorned with chipped silver rings and stained with paint, are poised over a sketchbook filled with intricate sketches of potential designs for a Parisian apartment.  This project, however, was unlike any other she'd undertaken. 

A sudden gust of wind whips through the alley, scattering her carefully gathered fabrics and sending shivers down Eloise's spine. She glances up to see an imposing figure silhouetted against the light of the streetlamp â€“ a man who oozed an air of mystery, his fedora casting shadows across his face. 

The rain starts pouring heavier, mimicking the rapid rhythm of Eloise's heart beating in her chest. The man raises his hand, and a small black raven perched on his shoulder croaks out a warning call. 
    
**The opening question:**  What is this man seeking from Eloise, and what secrets are hidden within the velvet cage of her creativity?
