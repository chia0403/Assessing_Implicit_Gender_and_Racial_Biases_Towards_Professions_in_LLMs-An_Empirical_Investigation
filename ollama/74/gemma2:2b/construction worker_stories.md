The air hung thick with sawdust and diesel exhaust, a pungent mix that settled permanently on Felix's worn leather jacket like the weight of years spent hammering away at concrete dreams. The city skyline pulsed above him, a chaotic symphony of steel and glass that reflected in the rain-slicked asphalt below.  Felix was no stranger to this urban jungle – he’d spent his life building its walls, its bridges, its very foundations. His calloused hands, strong enough to lift a ton of steel beam, were now carefully placing the last bricks of a new apartment complex in the heart of the city. It was a job that required precision and patience, just like the intricate dance he’d once performed on the ballet stage before his back went sour. 

He watched as a young woman hurried down the street, her face etched with worry. Her vibrant yellow umbrella battled the wind while she fought to stay upright against the relentless onslaught of rain. It wasn't until Felix caught sight of the crumpled paper clutched in her hand that the weight of the story began to unfold in his mind.
