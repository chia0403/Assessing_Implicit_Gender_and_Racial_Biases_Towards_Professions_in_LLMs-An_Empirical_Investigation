## Story Opening 

The city of New York pulsed beneath Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's fingertips.  Her canvas wasn’t stretched canvas or primed with acrylics; it was a vast digital landscape swirling with vibrant color and dynamic movement projected across the screen of her Macbook Pro. Her workshop, an attic apartment overlooking bustling Broadway, felt more like a secret fortress than any dwelling space. 

Outside the window, the late summer sun bled into the horizon, painting streaks of orange and violet on the brick buildings that lined the street.  But Amy's eyes were fixed on the screen, her brow furrowed in concentration as she wrestled with the latest commission - a logo for an upscale vegan bakery called "The Blooming Petal." 

She clicked through menus, scrolling endlessly between mockups of floral patterns, hand-drawn illustrations, and geometric shapes. The brief, provided by a nervous, young owner named Ethan, demanded something that would capture both the organic beauty of plant life and the modern sophistication of their clientele.  A problem Amy had grown accustomed to – translating abstract concepts into tangible visuals for her clients.
