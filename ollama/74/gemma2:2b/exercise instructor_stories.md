The humid air clung to Evelyn "Eve" Hawthorne like a second skin, even through the mesh of her running shorts and breathable top. Palm trees swayed gently in the breeze, casting long shadows on the glistening concrete of the gym floor. A low, persistent drone filled the space – the whirring of fans struggling against the relentless heat that pulsed from the sun-baked earth beyond the building's walls. 

Eve surveyed her usually vibrant class with a growing unease. The usual flurry of energy had been replaced by a hesitant silence, broken only by the rhythmic thudding of sweat on skin and the occasional cough. Today was supposed to be different – "Motivation Day," as she fondly dubbed it - filled with pep talks and upbeat music to push her students towards their fitness goals. But even Eve felt defeated, like a wilting flower in the harsh desert sun. 

Eve took a deep breath, adjusting her microphone and forcing a smile for the first time all morning. "Okay, folks," she announced through a haze of sweat-soaked fabric, her voice sounding strained even to her own ears.  "Let's get this party started! We’re going to conquer this heat, one rep at a time!”
