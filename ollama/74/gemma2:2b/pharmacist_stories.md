The aroma of cinnamon and cloves hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sterile scent of cleaning solution and the faint, underlying hum of the pharmacy’s antiquated refrigeration unit. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, pale shadows across the cluttered shelves, highlighting dust motes dancing in the stale light. 

Behind the counter, Evelyn Croft adjusted her glasses, sighing as she wrestled a stubborn pack of cough syrup into an overflowing medicine cabinet. "Another day, another dose," she muttered to herself, her hands callused and strong from years spent tending to this pharmacy nestled on the outskirts of Oakhaven. Her grey hair was pulled back tight, giving her a look that was both fierce and comforting. 

Evelyn wasn't just a pharmacist; she was the guardian of secrets whispered in hushed tones, the confidante for grieving families, and the quiet champion of forgotten illnesses.  She’d run this humble shop for nearly two decades now, watching Oakhaven change from a sleepy town to a bustling city. She knew every customer like they were family - Mrs. Peterson's regular dose of melatonin after her nightly walks with her chihuahua, young Timmy's frequent requests for energy supplements after soccer practice, and old Mr. Thompson's never-ending supply of antihistamines for his perpetual hay fever. 

Today, however, something was different.  A heavy silence hung over the store, punctuated only by the quiet clinking of a coffee mug Evelyn kept in reserve for unexpected emergencies. It wasn’t just the usual pre-dawn routine; it was something deeper, something that stirred a peculiar unease within her as she stared at the steady stream of customers slowly walking into the shop.
