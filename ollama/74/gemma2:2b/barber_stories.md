The steam from a pot of brewing coffee swirled around Bartholomew "Bart" Hawthorne's thick mustache as he surveyed his shop. "Hawthorne's Razor," it read in faded red letters above the worn-down doorway, a testament to a century of haircuts and stories whispered under the fluorescent hum of the bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling. Outside, the bustling city roared with an uncaring indifference to Bart’s corner of the world, but inside, time moved differently; each snip of his clippers felt like a pause button in life's hectic symphony. 

The shop was dim, dominated by a worn-out wooden barber chair and shelves crammed with faded magazines and stray combs – remnants of past clients and their stories.  Bart, at least for the next hour, could ignore the roar outside; he could even pretend to hear the gentle hum of his own thoughts. He'd been known to be a bit of a recluse, more comfortable in the company of shears and a good lullaby than the cacophony of the city. 

Today was different.  A woman stood at the entrance, her face pale under the harsh glare of the fluorescent lights, clutching a letter that looked like it had been through a war zone. Her eyes, large and sad, darted from Bart to the door as she nervously took a step into his shop.  This day, the city's roar was swallowed by the quiet rustle of her nervous breaths.
