The air hung thick with anticipation and a vaguely metallic scent, like old blood and burnt oil.  Evelyn "Evie" Hawthorne adjusted her tired smile behind the worn, floral-patterned plastic mask that served as her daily shield against the world's grime and the occasional spitball thrown by particularly disgruntled patients. The waiting room at Dr. Thorne's clinic was a cacophony of coughs and whimpers, the fluorescent lights hummed an insistent drone, and the air conditioner wheezed like a tired old dog. 

Dr. Thorne, a man whose ambition could only be matched by his sharp-eyed disapproval of anything that wasn't "scientifically sound" or "prescribed," had always believed in keeping things pristine. Evelyn was the embodiment of what Dr. Thorne saw as chaotic disorder - she wore mismatched socks, her hair a wild halo against the sterile white walls, and her smile felt more like a reluctant grimace than genuine cheerfulness. Yet, despite all this...Evie seemed to be the only one who could truly decipher the doctor's cryptic notes and his unspoken demands. 

She glanced at the clock, its neon face mockingly bright in the dim light.  Another hour until Dr. Thorne would return from his "research" - whatever that meant in the context of a small-town clinic on the edge of nowhere. He was due back any minute now. A wave of anxiety rolled over Evie, leaving behind a trail of clammy palms and a sudden urge to escape into the endless maze of paperwork that filled her desk like a forgotten nightmare.
