The asphalt stretched before him like a ribbon of burnt sienna under the unforgiving Arizona sun.  Dust devils danced in the distance, their swirling forms mocking the endless rhythm of the highway.  His rig, "Lucky Seven," coughed and wheezed its way down I-10, carrying its own dusty burden – the weight of his dreams and the hollow echo of loneliness. 

Reginald "Reg" McTavish wiped sweat from his brow, a sigh escaping him like exhaust fumes on the hot day.  His weathered face, etched with countless miles and unspoken stories, was fixed in the reflection of the sun-baked windshield. He wasn't just any trucker; he was a legend amongst legends, known for his unwavering resolve and uncanny ability to navigate the treacherous backroads with the precision of a surgeon. Today, however, even his seasoned grit couldn't mask the gnawing anxiety that shadowed his every move. This delivery was different – this load held more than just steel or concrete; it contained a secret he could barely comprehend. 

His destination: a ramshackle diner nestled deep in the heart of nowhere, its neon sign flickering a sickly green against the desert night sky.  Reg knew this place. It was a haven for weary souls like him, a place where stories were exchanged over lukewarm coffee and the echo of forgotten dreams lingered in the air. Tonight, he would need it all – his grit, his wit, and the quiet solace found only in the company of strangers, if he wanted to unravel the mystery that shadowed his journey, one mile at a time.
