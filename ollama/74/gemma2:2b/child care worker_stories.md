The morning sunlight slanted through the kitchen window, turning the worn linoleum floor into an intricate mosaic of light and shadow. It was one of those days in Maple Creek where the sun seemed to hold itself back, hesitant to fully bloom above the horizon.  A chill hung in the air despite the early hour, a reminder that even in summer, the nights could bring a bite to your bones. 

My name is Evelyn "Evie" Rose, and today like every other day, I am immersed in the whirlwind of tiny lives and oversized emotions that are the hallmark of my work as a child care worker at Sunnyside Farm Daycare. The aroma of burnt toast wafted from the kitchen counter, a familiar scent amidst the cacophony of giggles, shrieks, and the gentle murmurings of "Mommy" and "Daddy." 

The year's first batch of wildflowers were blooming in the garden by the fence, their colors vibrant against the pale green grass. The children loved to run around them, their eyes wide with wonder as they chased butterflies that fluttered from one blossom to another. It was a picture postcard scene, but it felt particularly poignant today - like the promise of something more than just ordinary summer.
