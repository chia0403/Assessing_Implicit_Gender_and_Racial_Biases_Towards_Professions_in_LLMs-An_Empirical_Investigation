The air in Mr. Archibald Thistlewick's office was thick with the smell of burnt coffee and existential dread.  Archibald himself looked like he'd walked through a blizzard, his normally neat grey suit now hanging slightly askew. The fluorescent lights hummed above him, casting an anemic glow on the mountain range of tax returns stacked high on his desk. 

It was December in Chicago, a season that usually brought about warmth and cheer - but for Archibald, it was another nail in the coffin of his already crumbling hopes.  He stared at the spreadsheet before him, each number a tiny hammer blow to his dwindling spirit. Today's deadline loomed large, a monstrous sum of tax returns due in just hours. It seemed like every year this season brought a cruel twist of fate: first his beloved partner left for "a new life" that ended up resembling an endless string of spreadsheets, then a promotion gone wrong led to him facing a sea of tax forms he couldn't possibly decipher. 

He was Archibald Thistlewick, and it seemed like the world itself was conspiring against him.  His only solace was a stray dog-eared copy of Kafka's "The Metamorphosis," which offered little comfort but at least allowed him to escape into the surreal for a few minutes each evening. Tonight, however, even Kafka couldnâ€™t offer much solace.
