The air hung thick with the scent of burnt bourbon and old dreams in The Rusty Mug, a dive bar clinging to the edge of what was once a thriving city district. Dust motes danced in the dim glow cast by an ancient neon sign that read "Welcome -  Hope & Despair." It wasn't an inviting name for a place so bleakly faded from its former glory, but then again, neither was the name on the worn-down bartop where Elara worked: 'The Nightingale's Whisper.' 

Elara, with her cascading auburn hair and eyes like chipped amethyst, ran The Nightingale’s Whisper as if it were a living, breathing thing.  She knew every creak of the floorboards, every stain on the worn velvet booths, every glint of mischief in the patrons' eyes, and each one held a story she was only too eager to hear. Elara, though, wasn't always good at listening. Sometimes, the stories were more about her than those who sought solace within The Nightingale’s Whisper.  Tonight, however, she found herself distracted by an unsettling hush that settled over the bar as the door creaked open and a man stepped in, his face hidden beneath a wide-brimmed fedora.
