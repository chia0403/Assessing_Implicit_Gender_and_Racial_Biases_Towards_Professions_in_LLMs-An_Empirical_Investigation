The old stone archway creaked like a tired groan as Elias stepped through it, his worn boots kicking up dust that instantly settled on his already stained overalls. The air held the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves – familiar smells to anyone who lived in the sprawling gardens of Blackwood Manor.  Elias was a man of routine, a silent guardian of this place where centuries-old traditions intertwined with thorny roses and towering oaks. For years, he'd tended the estate's sprawling grounds – his only company the murmur of wind whispering through the ancient trees and the occasional chirp of a hidden bird. 

Today, however, something was different. A chill, not quite from the autumn air, seeped into Elias’ bones. A sense of foreboding, like a veil had fallen over Blackwood Manor, cloaking it in an eerie silence. 
  
The manor itself stood proud and imposing against the fading sunlight, its walls scarred with years of neglect but still exuding an undeniable grandeur. But tonight, even its majestic facade seemed to falter under a weight Elias couldn't quite grasp. He straightened his posture, adjusting the battered tool bag slung over his shoulder, and took stock of his usual routine – a quiet, solitary task. But as he looked around, the air hummed with a subtle energy that set his teeth on edge. Something was wrong. Very wrong. 


**Elias Blackwood:** Groundskeeper to Blackwood Manor. He lives by the rhythm of nature, finding solace in the silence and beauty of the ancient grounds.
