## The Smell of Elm

**Setting:** A windswept coastal village named Oakhaven nestled amongst rugged cliffs and whispering waves in the far-flung north of England. The year is 1879, and the air carries the scent of brine and woodsmoke mingled with the ever-present chill of the North Sea.

**Character:**  Elsie Thornewood, renowned carpenter of Oakhaven, stood on her weathered wooden porch, the smell of elm heavy in his lungs as he gazed out at the tumultuous sea. He ran a hand over his thick, salt-streaked hair, its natural grey streaks stark against his youthful face. Elsie's eyes, however, held the wisdom and weariness that only years spent building with wood could bestow. His calloused hands, strong from decades of shaping oak and pine into homes and boats, were stained brown and rough. 

Elsie was a craftsman known for his meticulous work and quiet demeanor, an enigma to many in Oakhaven. He built not just houses, but souls; each piece imbued with a touch of the heart. But today, the calm sea did little to soothe Elsie's troubled thoughts. His gaze shifted towards a looming storm brewing on the horizon, mirroring the unease twisting within him like a ship caught in a tempest.  


He had received an urgent request from Lord Ashton â€“ a wealthy lord with a history of demanding and unreasonable requests. The task was simple: build a chest for the Lord's prized collection of rare seashells, but the weight of the request felt heavier than any oak or cedar log he had ever worked with. And Elsie wasn't sure if his heart could hold it.
