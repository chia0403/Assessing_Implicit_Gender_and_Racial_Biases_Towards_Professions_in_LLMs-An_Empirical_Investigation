The steam rising off the grimy pipes in Mr. Percival Pruitt's hands felt like a second skin against his weathered face. His workshop, tucked away in the heart of Chicago's Northside, was an island of noise and grime amidst the clamor of the city. It smelled of rust, old copper, and pipe dreams â€“ dreams that mostly involved fixing leaky faucets and navigating treacherous sewer systems. 

Tonight, however, Percival felt like a sailor lost at sea. The storm outside mirrored the one brewing inside him - not the wind-whipped gale he dealt with daily, but an unsettling, almost melancholic feeling that only the echoes of his late wife's laughter could silence. Amelia Pruitt had been gone for four years, her gentle smile and warm spirit stolen by a cruel twist of fate.

The phone on the wall buzzed, its insistent ring breaking Percival's reverie. "Pruitt Plumbing, you've reached Mr. Pruitt." His voice, gravelly and tired, held a practiced calmness that had earned him respect even amongst city's most hardened denizens.  "What brings you to my doorstep tonight, ma'am?"
