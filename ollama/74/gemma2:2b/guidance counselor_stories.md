Rain lashed against the windows of Northside High's counseling office, blurring the world beyond into an impressionistic dance of gray and black.  Inside, amidst the comforting scent of lavender air freshener and a worn map of the town pinned to the wall (which was rumored to hold secrets of uncharted territory), sat Ms. Eleanor Thorne, otherwise known as Ellie, her reflection in the glass swirling like a troubled lake. 

For years sheâ€™d been a beacon of light, an island of calm amidst the tumultuous tides of teenage emotions. But lately, something had shifted within Ellie. She felt adrift, like a sailboat tossed about on a restless sea. The students were more unpredictable than ever, their problems seemingly spiraling out of control faster than a runaway train down a mountain track.  The weight of it all was settling upon her weary shoulders, leaving her feeling both exhausted and overwhelmed. 


**Character:** Ms. Eleanor Thorne, the guidance counselor at Northside High School
 **Setting:** Northside High School in a small coastal town - bustling with teens and their anxieties. The town is known for its unpredictable weather, with days of sunshine often giving way to sudden downpours.  

Is there anything else you'd like me to add or change about the opening?
