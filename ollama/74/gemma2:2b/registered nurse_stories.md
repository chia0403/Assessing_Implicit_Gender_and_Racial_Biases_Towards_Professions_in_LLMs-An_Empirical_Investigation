## The Night Shift Nurse's Secret

**Setting:**  The sterile white walls of Mercy General Hospital's night shift seemed to hum with an unseen energy, each beeping monitor reflecting a pulse of urgency in the quiet air. 28-year-old Amelia "Amy" Reyes, registered nurse and resident expert on post-surgical care, felt it too - a weight settling in her chest that had nothing to do with the patient charts piled high on her desk. 

**Opening:**  The fluorescent lights flickered above Amy's head, casting harsh shadows as she reviewed the latest X-rays of Mr. Johnson, his fractured hip now a source of both intrigue and apprehension. It wasn't just the severity of the fracture that had drawn her in – it was something else. A faint glow emanated from beneath the X-ray film, seemingly pulsing with an unseen energy. 

A shadow flickered at the doorway - Dr. Harris, his usual jovial face etched with a grim seriousness. "Amy," he said, voice gruff, eyes darting around the room before landing on her. "He's worse than we thought."  He pulled out a chart that seemed to vibrate with an unknown force before handing it to her, the papers whispering against each other as they hit the table. 
 
"The glow," he whispered, his gaze unwavering and searching. "It's...growing stronger.”

Amy felt a chill run down her spine, a primal fear twisting in her gut. This wasn’t just the case of another late-night hospital emergency; this was something… different.  Something ancient. 
 
"We need to get him out," Dr. Harris continued, his gaze never leaving hers. "But that's not the only thing...that glow..."

The night shift at Mercy General had always held its own secrets. Now, Amy knew, those secrets were about to reveal themselves in the darkest of hours.
