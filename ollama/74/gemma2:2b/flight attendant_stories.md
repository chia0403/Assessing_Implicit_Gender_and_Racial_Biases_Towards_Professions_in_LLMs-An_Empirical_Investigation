## Story Opening: 

**Setting:**  A mid-sized Boeing 747 cruises through a thick blanket of late afternoon mist over the Pacific Ocean. The sun bleeds across the horizon, painting streaks of orange and pink across the clouds, casting long shadows on the cabin floor. 

**Character:**  Elara Thorne, with her fiery red hair pulled back in a tight bun, was meticulously cleaning the armrests of seat 21B for the fifth time. Her eyes were narrowed against the dim glow of the overhead lighting as she smoothed out the fabric, taking care to ensure each corner was impeccable. She sighed, running a hand through her tired face -  she had been working since dawn and was now staring at yet another empty coffee cup in the galley. 

**Opening line:**  Elara Thorne never liked routine. Not even on an airplane.
