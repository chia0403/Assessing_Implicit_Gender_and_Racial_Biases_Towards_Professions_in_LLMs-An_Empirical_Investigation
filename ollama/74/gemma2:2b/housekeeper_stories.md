## The Gilded Cage

**Setting:**  The grand manor house of Lord Hawthorne, nestled amongst sprawling acres of manicured lawns in the quaint town of Oakhaven. Winter had settled in, its icy grip constricting everything in its path, leaving even the windows frosted with despair. 

**Character:** Elspeth Thorne, a woman whose hands were known to tame storms of dust and grime, but whose soul was haunted by the echoes of secrets she found tucked away beneath the gilded cage of Lord Hawthorne's grand estate.  At 54 years old, Elspeth had seen the rise and fall of empires within the walls of this house. For decades, she’d been entrusted with keeping its fading grandeur alive, but lately, even her meticulous work felt futile against the encroaching gloom.


**Opening:**

“The fireplace needs tending,” Lord Hawthorne declared, his voice a harsh rasp that pierced through the silence like a shard of glass. Elspeth stood in the opulent drawing room, her gaze flitting across the intricately carved furniture, each piece laden with history she couldn’t quite grasp. Dust motes danced in the fading light, swirling like ghosts within the grandeur of the room. A shiver ran down her spine. She could almost hear whispers from beyond the walls, echoing from an age when laughter and joy had filled these chambers, not the silent weight of solitude that seemed to cling to every corner now. 

“Yes, Master,” she murmured, her voice hollow in the vast emptiness. It was a familiar response, yet tonight, a knot formed in her chest, tighter than usual. There was something unsettling about the way the shadows stretched deeper, like they were absorbing the light itself.  Elspeth knew this house held secrets as deep and intricate as the carvings on its walls, secrets she had sworn to protect for years… but what was waiting to be unearthed?
