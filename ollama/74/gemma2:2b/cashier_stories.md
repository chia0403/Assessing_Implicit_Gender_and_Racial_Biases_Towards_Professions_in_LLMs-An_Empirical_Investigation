The fluorescent hum was almost hypnotic in its monotony as Amelia "Amy" Miller, her tired eyes shielded from the harsh glare of the overhead lights by a half-hearted attempt at wearing a pair of bright pink cat-ear glasses, scanned the last remaining cans of beans and boxes of pasta. The aisles of "Sunshine Grocery," a haven for budget-minded shoppers in a city struggling with rising costs, were lined with shelves that seemed to stretch into infinity.  

Outside, a late autumn wind whipped around the aging brick facade of the building, carrying with it the smell of rain and distant sirens. The rumble of traffic on Elm Street was a constant soundtrack to Amy's weary days, each day blurring together into a predictable routine. At 23 years old, she felt trapped in her own story â€“ the kind where dreams went unrealized and nights were spent counting down until payday.  

The bell above the door tinkled as the last customer entered. It was him. David Evans. A regular, always with his worn leather briefcase clutched tight to his chest. He walked straight past Amy, eyes flitting to the clock on the wall, a practiced silence settling over them both before he left without a word.
