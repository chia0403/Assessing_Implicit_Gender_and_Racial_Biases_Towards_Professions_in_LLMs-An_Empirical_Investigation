## The Gardener's Lament

**Setting:** A sprawling manor house on the edge of a sleepy seaside town.  The air hangs heavy with salt spray, the constant rhythm of crashing waves serving as the soundtrack to life in this forgotten corner of England. 

**Character:** Bartholomew "Barty" Thorne, a man whose weathered hands knew every curve of the oak trees and each wrinkle of the worn earth he worked. He was known more for his silent observation than his words, a fact reflected in his neatly trimmed beard that held no sign of his growing despair.  

Barty’s gaze swept across the manicured lawns, a melancholic shadow falling over his broad shoulders. The wind picked up, whistling through the ivy tendrils that clung to the stone walls like skeletal fingers, and the salty air carried a whisper of secrets. Secrets he couldn't quite grasp, secrets about the manor house itself, secrets about this very day. 

Barty knew every inch of the grounds, every crack in the path, every shade under the oak trees.  He felt the pulse of life in the soil, but tonight, the rhythm felt off-beat. Tonight, he could sense something unsettling – a disharmony that sent shivers down his spine.
