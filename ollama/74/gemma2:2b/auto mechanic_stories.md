## The Smell of Gasoline and Secrets

The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt oil and a faint, metallic tang that only real grease could conjure.  Rain pattered on the tin roof of Eddie Miller's garage, a familiar rhythm echoing the steady hum of the engine in his hands.  Eddie, all elbows and calloused fingers, was working on a cherry red '67 Mustang, its body gleaming under the dim garage lights like a forgotten dream. The car had been brought in weeks ago, owner Mr. Henderson claiming it was "just running rough." But Eddie knew better – there was something hidden beneath the rusted paneling of his words.  

Eddie's fingers moved deftly over the engine, tracing the scars left by countless hours spent under its hood. He could smell the car's story in the thick grease, hear echoes of forgotten victories and hard-earned losses. The Mustang’s past was entangled with Mr. Henderson's – a tangled web Eddie had become inexplicably drawn to unravel.
