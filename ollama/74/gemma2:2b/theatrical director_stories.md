## Opening 

A single spotlight illuminated the dusty stage curtain, its pale luminescence reflecting off the worn wood of the backstage platform.  The air hung heavy with the scent of mothballs and forgotten dreams â€“ a familiar perfume to **Cassian Thorne**, his name as imposing and theatrical as his aspirations. The roar of the city outside pulsed like an angry heartbeat in the silence of the theatre. A single window, grimy and high above, offered a glimpse of the neon-drenched skyline, but Cassian's gaze was fixed on the empty stage before him. 

His fingers drummed nervously on his worn script, its pages dogeared from countless late nights spent wrestling with characters and plotlines. Tonight wasn't about crafting another tragedy; tonight was about bringing back a legend.  Cassian, renowned for his bold productions and avant-garde vision, was determined to recreate the magic that once graced these very walls: **The Tempest**.

**Setting:** A crumbling theatre in London, steeped in history but plagued by neglect. 
* **Year:** The late 19th century.
* **Atmosphere:**  Dusty, shadowed, and echoing with memories both joyous and sorrowful.  A hint of decay hangs heavy, a testament to the city's ceaseless march forward.
