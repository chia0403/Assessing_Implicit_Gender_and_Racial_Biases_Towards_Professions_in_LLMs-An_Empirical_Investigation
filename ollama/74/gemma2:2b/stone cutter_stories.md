The sun beat down on Avani's back as he hammered away at the granite block, its coolness a stark contrast to the searing heat radiating off his face.  Avani Patel, a man known for his gentle touch and surprisingly strong hands, worked with an artist’s precision in his small workshop nestled amidst the bustling chaos of Mumbai's antique markets.  The air was thick with the scent of dust, sawdust, and granite - a familiar aroma he cherished as much as the cool water that kept him from scorching during long workdays. 

His latest commission: a memorial for the late Rajendra Singh, a wealthy patriarch who had supported Avani's family through thick and thin. The stone was a smooth grey marble, chosen for its quiet dignity – an echo of Singh’s own stoic nature.  Avani worked tirelessly, his movements a dance of grace and strength as he chipped away at the surface, shaping it into a portrait of Singh that captured not just his physical appearance but also the gentle kindness etched into his eyes.

This was Avani's life - carving out memories in stone, crafting stories that would echo for generations. But this commission held a weight he hadn’t expected.  It wasn't just about the monument; it was about understanding Rajendra Singh, about finding the truth hidden beneath layers of time and memory.
