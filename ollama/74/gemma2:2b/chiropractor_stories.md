The humid Florida air hung thick as molasses as Dr. Alistair Finch adjusted his glasses and looked out across his cluttered office, "Harmony Chiropractic,"  the faded teal paint on the door peeling like sunburnt skin. He sighed, rubbing his temples and wondering if he’d ever truly find that elusive sense of harmony in this life, or if he was just destined to be a lone craftsman mending the broken bodies of the world one cracked spine at a time.  

A soft knock on the door broke his train of thought, snapping him back to reality. Alistair's gaze fell upon Mrs. Beatrice Davis, her wrinkled face framed by strands of silver hair, as she clutched an oversized wicker basket in her hand, seemingly struggling against its weight. "I brought you a little something for your… uh…" she stumbled over the word, her eyes flitting nervously to him before settling on the battered chair beside his desk, "...your 'adjustment' today."  

Alistair chuckled wryly. Mrs. Davis was as unpredictable as the Florida weather, yet somehow, he always managed to find a thread of genuine warmth in her weathered soul. He knew that something more than just back pain awaited him in her basket this morning.
