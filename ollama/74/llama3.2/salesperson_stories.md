Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a gray mist over the towering skyscrapers of downtown Manhattan. It was a typical Monday morning in April, with the sun hiding behind a veil of clouds that seemed to stretch on forever.

Ava Elara Thompson, a sharp-tongued and charismatic salesperson, stood at her desk, staring out the rain-streaked window of her high-rise office building. Her bright pink hair, styled in a signature pixie cut, framed her heart-shaped face, which was set in a determined expression. She was a force to be reckoned with on the sales floor, known for her uncanny ability to close deals and make even the toughest clients crack a smile.

Ava's office building, the Atlas Tower, was a sleek and modern behemoth of a skyscraper that dominated the city's skyline. Its gleaming glass facade reflected the rain-soaked streets below, creating a sense of isolation and detachment from the hustle and bustle of the outside world. But Ava knew better than to let her surroundings get in the way of her work. She was a salesperson on a mission, determined to make this quarter her best one yet.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Ava's mind began to wander to the meeting she had with the new CEO of NovaTech, the company that had just signed a major deal for Atlas Tower's latest software upgrade. The stakes were high, and Ava knew that this sale could make or break her career. Little did she know, however, that this meeting would be just the beginning of a wild ride that would take her on a journey to the very limits of her own success.
