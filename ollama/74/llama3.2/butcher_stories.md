A strange package had arrived at his doorstep one evening, wrapped in brown paper and twine, with no indication of who might have sent it or what it could contain. The bundle weighed heavy on his mind, and Angus couldn't help but wonder if this mysterious delivery was connected to the recent string of burglaries that had been plaguing Ashwood's countryside...
