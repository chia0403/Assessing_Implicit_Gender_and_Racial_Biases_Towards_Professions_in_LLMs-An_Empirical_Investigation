Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. The air was thick with the scent of frankincense and myrrh, carried on the whispers of tourists streaming through the narrow passage. Amidst the chaos, Drusilla Anastasia Petrov stood at the edge of the crowd, her eyes scanning the throng with a practiced air of expertise.

As one of Petra's most experienced tour guides, Drusilla had spent years honing her knowledge of the city's intricate history and architecture. She knew every nook and cranny, every hidden corner and ancient secret. Her clients adored her, drawn to her infectious enthusiasm and deep love for the place she called home.

Tonight, however, Drusilla felt a sense of unease creeping over her. It wasn't just the usual pre-tour jitters – though those were certainly present in abundance – but something deeper. A feeling that tonight was different from all the others. Maybe it was the way the setting sun seemed to cast long shadows across the stones, or perhaps it was the hushed tones of conversation she'd overheard among the tour group earlier that day.

Whatever the reason, Drusilla couldn't shake the sense that something was off. And as she began her own journey through the Siq, a sense of trepidation grew in the pit of her stomach – for she knew that tonight's tour would be one she'd never forget.
