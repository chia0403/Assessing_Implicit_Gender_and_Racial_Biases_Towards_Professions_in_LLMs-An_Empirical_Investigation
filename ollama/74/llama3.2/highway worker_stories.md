Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the worn asphalt of Highway 12, casting a golden glow over the endless stretch of asphalt that seemed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline and freshly cut grass as Ryder Jameson wiped the sweat from his brow, taking a moment to survey the damage to the road.

As a highway worker for the state department of transportation, Ryder had seen it all - the potholes, the crashes, the endless hours spent patching up the same old problems. He had grown used to the monotony of it all, but that didn't mean he liked it any less. There was something satisfying about knowing that his work kept people safe on the roads, even if it didn't always make for the most exciting job.

Ryder's truck, a beat-up old Ford F-150 with a faded "USDA" logo on the side panel, sat parked beside him, its engine purring softly as he scanned the horizon. The road stretched out before him like a ribbon of concrete, disappearing into the distance as the sun dipped lower in the sky.

Just then, Ryder's radio crackled to life, breaking the silence. "Ryder Jameson, this is dispatch. We've got a report of a multi-vehicle accident on the highway ahead. Repeat, multiple vehicles involved. Be advised, emergency services are on the way."

Ryder's gut tightened as he glanced at his watch. He had been working non-stop for hours, and he was starting to feel the effects of fatigue. But he knew better than to slow down now - he had a job to do, and that job was to get those cars off the road before someone got hurt.
