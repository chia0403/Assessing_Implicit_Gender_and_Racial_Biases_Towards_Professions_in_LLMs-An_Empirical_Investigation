Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the concrete canyons of downtown Manhattan, Aurora "Rory" Thompson settled into her favorite stool at McGillicuddy's Pub, a dingy but reliable haunt for systems analysts like herself. The sounds of the city gave way to the familiar hum of the pub's jukebox and the murmur of hushed conversations from the regulars.

Aurora Thompson, a 28-year-old systems analyst with a sharp mind and quick wit, nursed her whiskey on the rocks, surveying the crowd with an air of quiet confidence. Her dark brown hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a smattering of freckles across her cheeks that seemed to sparkle in the dim light.

Rory's eyes scanned the room, taking in the faces of her colleagues and acquaintances â€“ all struggling to find meaning in a world where technology had become the new norm. She thought about her own job at NovaTech, where she spent most of her days debugging code and trying to make sense of the company's Byzantine IT infrastructure.

As she sipped her drink, Rory's phone buzzed with an incoming text from an unknown number: "Meet me on the rooftop at midnight. Come alone."
