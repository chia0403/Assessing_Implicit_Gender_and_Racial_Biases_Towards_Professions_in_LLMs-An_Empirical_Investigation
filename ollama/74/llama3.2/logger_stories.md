Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the coast of Ravenswood, shrouding the small logging town in a damp, gray mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a bad omen. In the heart of this eerie landscape stood the old Sawmill 7, where 35-year-old Jethro Beaumont spent his days felling giant spruce trees and his nights sipping whiskey at the local saloon.

Jethro was a rugged, weathered man with arms as thick as tree trunks and hands that seemed to be made of the same rough-hewn wood. He'd grown up in Ravenswood, where his family had logged these woods for generations, and he knew every inch of the forest like the back of his hand. But despite his deep connection to this land, Jethro felt a growing sense of restlessness, as if there was more to life than the endless cycle of chopping down trees and hauling them out to market.

As he walked into the saloon, the swinging doors creaking behind him like a tired gate, Jethro spotted his friends, Jeb and Jebediah, huddled in the corner, nursing mugs of cold beer. They nodded at him as he made his way over, their faces somber, their eyes fixed on some unseen horizon beyond the reach of the dim saloon lights.

"What's got you two looking so glum?" Jethro asked, dropping into the booth beside them.

Jeb spoke up first, his voice low and serious. "It's about the new logging company coming in," he said, his eyes narrowing at Jethro. "They're gonna start hiring outside labor, taking away our jobs."

Jebediah nodded, his face a map of worry lines. "And they've got some fancy equipment too, something that'll make us obsolete even faster."

Jethro's grip on his mug tightened as he listened to their words, feeling the familiar knot of unease form in his stomach. Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a journey that would take him deep into the heart of Ravenswood's secrets, and set him on a collision course with forces beyond his control.
