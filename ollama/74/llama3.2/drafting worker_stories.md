In a small workshop tucked away on Ditchley Street, Edwin Fletcher Bottomsworth hunched over his drafting board, his eyes straining to focus on the intricate plans for the new steam engine he was tasked with designing.

Edwin's own fingers moved deftly across the pencil as he worked, the scratch of graphite on paper a soothing accompaniment to the hum of the engine he had designed.
