Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the worn linoleum floor of Oakwood High School's administrative wing. Amidst the sea of dusty filing cabinets and forgotten textbooks, one man moved with a quiet purpose. His name was Edgar "Ed" Thompson, a janitor with over 20 years of service to the school. Ed took pride in his work, meticulously sweeping and mopping the floors to ensure the hallways remained spotless for the students and faculty.

As he pushed his cart filled with cleaning supplies down the deserted hallway, the only sound being the soft hum of the ventilation system, Ed's thoughts wandered to the upcoming staff meeting scheduled for later that day. Rumors had been circulating about potential budget cuts, and Ed worried about how they would affect his already meager salary and benefits.

As he turned a corner, the door to the school's cafeteria swung open, revealing a flurry of activity. Students were chatting and laughing as they waited for their lunches to be served. Ed felt a pang of nostalgia wash over him; he had spent countless hours sweeping up spills and cleaning tables in this very same area when he was a student himself.

Just as Ed was about to continue on his way, a piece of paper caught his eye on the floor. It was a crumpled up envelope with no return address, but a single sentence scrawled on it in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at the old classroom at 3 PM if you want to know the truth."
