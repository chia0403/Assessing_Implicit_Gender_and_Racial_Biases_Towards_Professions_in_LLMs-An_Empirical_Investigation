Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun set over the sprawling city of New Haven, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers and quaint brownstones, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood outside her office building, sipping on a lukewarm coffee and staring out at the bustling streets. A real estate agent with years of experience under her belt, Lexi had seen it all - from the glamorous penthouse apartments to the rundown fixer-uppers. But tonight was different. Tonight, she was facing a new challenge.

Lexi's eyes scanned the crowded sidewalk, taking in the sea of strangers rushing to and fro. She was waiting for a potential client, a wealthy businessman named Marcus Wellington, who had scheduled an appointment with her for 7 PM. Lexi had been working with Marcus for weeks, trying to convince him to sell his prized waterfront estate in the exclusive neighborhood of Riverview Heights.

As she gazed out at the city, Lexi's mind wandered back to the long day she'd just had. She'd spent hours poring over property listings, meeting with clients, and negotiating deals. But despite her best efforts, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about Marcus Wellington. There was a sense of unease in the air, a feeling that Lexi couldn't quite put her finger on.

Just as she was starting to wonder if she'd misread the situation entirely, Lexi's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her assistant, Emily. "Marcus just walked in," the message read. "He looks... nervous."

Lexi took a deep breath, smoothing out her designer dress and straightening her shoulders. She had a feeling that this was going to be one night she would never forget.
