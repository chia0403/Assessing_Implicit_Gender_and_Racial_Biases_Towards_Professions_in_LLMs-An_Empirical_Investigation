Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain poured down like a relentless curtain on the city of Ashwood, casting a gloomy mist over the already deserted streets of downtown. Inside the imposing offices of Grayson & Associates, law firm, a lone figure stood by the window, gazing out at the deluge with a mixture of disdain and resignation.

Avery Elizabeth Windsor, a towering presence with piercing green eyes and raven-black hair, was a force to be reckoned with in the cutthroat world of corporate law. Her sharp mind and razor-sharp instincts had earned her a reputation as one of the most formidable lawyers in the city, but tonight, she felt like a small boat tossed about on a stormy sea.

As she stared out at the rain-soaked streets, Avery's thoughts were consumed by the case that had been dogging her for weeks: the high-profile lawsuit against the powerful conglomerate, Ashwood Industries. The corporation was accused of embezzling millions from its employees' pension funds, and Avery had taken it upon herself to prove their guilt.

But as she stood there, lost in thought, a sudden jolt of unease ran through her body. It was as if someone - or something - was watching her from the shadows. Avery's eyes scanned the room, but saw nothing out of the ordinary. Just the hum of fluorescent lights and the soft whisper of the rain outside.

Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. And in a city where secrets lurked around every corner, Avery knew that she had to be constantly on guard.
