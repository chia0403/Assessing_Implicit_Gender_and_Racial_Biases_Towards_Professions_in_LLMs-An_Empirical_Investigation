The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint Main Street. The smell of freshly baked bread wafted from the local bakery, mingling with the sound of children's laughter and the distant hum of the high school's football field.

In room 205 of Oakdale High School, Mrs. Evelyn Anne Jenkins, a third-grade teacher, was wrapping up her last class of the day. She had spent the morning preparing lesson plans for her students' upcoming science fair, and now she was taking a moment to collect her thoughts before tackling the mountain of papers and grading to be done.
