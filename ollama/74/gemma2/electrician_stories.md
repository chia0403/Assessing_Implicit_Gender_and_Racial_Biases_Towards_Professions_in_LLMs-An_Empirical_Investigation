The humid Georgia air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass as Elias Thorne adjusted his tool belt. Sweat beaded on his brow, already damp from the afternoon sun beating down on the dusty siding of Mrs. Henderson's farmhouse. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a greasy streak across his weathered face. 

Elias wasn't fond of farmhouses. They were always riddled with ancient wiring, tangled like a spider's web in forgotten corners. This one was no different. The flickering porch light he'd been called to fix had been the canary in the coal mine, a telltale sign of a deeper electrical issue lurking within the houseâ€™s walls.  

He glanced up at the wraparound porch, its peeling paint a pale imitation of its former glory. A worn rocking chair creaked gently on the steps, untouched by human hands for who knows how long. He imagined Mrs. Henderson, a woman he'd known since childhood, sitting here in her younger days, sipping sweet tea and watching the sun set over the cornfields. Now, she was confined to a nursing home, leaving her beloved farmhouse empty and vulnerable.

Elias took a deep breath and stepped onto the porch, his boots crunching on the gravel. He had a job to do.
