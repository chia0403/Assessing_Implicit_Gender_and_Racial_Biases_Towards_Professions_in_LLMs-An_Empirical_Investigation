The smell of sawdust hung thick in the air, a comforting scent to Elias Blackwood. He ran a calloused thumb over the smooth surface of the mahogany tabletop he was crafting, feeling the grain beneath his touch. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of his workshop, illuminating motes dancing in the warm air. Outside, the bustling town of Ashton Creek hummed with life, but inside, Elias found solace in the rhythmic thud of his hammer and the quiet whisper of wood yielding to his will. 

He’d inherited this workshop from his father, a master craftsman who had passed down more than just tools and techniques. Elias had absorbed his father's love for the craft, the respect for materials, and the unwavering dedication to creating something beautiful and enduring.  Ashton Creek was a town built on wood – houses, barns, furniture, all bearing the mark of skilled hands. 

Elias Blackwood wasn’t just a carpenter; he was an artist who sculpted with timber, breathing life into lifeless logs. He yearned for a commission that would truly challenge him, a project worthy of his father’s legacy.  Little did he know, a storm was brewing on the horizon, one that would bring a request unlike any he had ever encountered before.
