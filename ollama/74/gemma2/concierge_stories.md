The flickering neon sign outside cast a sickly green glow across Amelia Everleigh's impeccably starched uniform. She smoothed down the collar with one gloved hand, her gaze fixed on the deluge of rain hammering against the grand entrance of the Grand Majestic Hotel. It was 3:00 am, and the only sounds besides the storm were the rhythmic click of her heels on the polished marble floor and the occasional rumble of thunder that shook the building's very foundations.  

Amelia sighed, a sliver of frustration piercing through her usual composure. The rain had started just as the last guest departed, leaving her alone with an unsettling stillness punctuated by the distant, dissonant hum of the city. She glanced at the empty lobby, its opulent chandeliers casting long, dancing shadows that seemed to writhe in the gloom.  

This was never Amelia's favorite time of night. The silence was too heavy, the darkness too oppressive. It pressed in on her, a tangible entity that threatened to suffocate any trace of warmth or light. But tonight, it felt particularly menacing.  A prickle of unease ran down her spine. Something wasnâ€™t right.


The Grand Majestic, a relic from a bygone era, was known for its opulent suites, legendary service, and whispered tales of hauntings. Amelia, despite her years as the head concierge, still hadn't fully embraced the supernatural stories that clung to the building like cobwebs. Yet, tonight, she couldn't shake the feeling that something more sinister lurked beneath the surface of the storm-swept night.
