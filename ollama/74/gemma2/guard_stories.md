The rusted iron gates groaned open with the effort, spitting out sparks like dragon's breath onto the cobblestones. Seraphina Thorne, her tunic heavy with the weight of duty and years spent beneath the unforgiving sun, watched the wagon trundle through. Dust swirled around its wheels, momentarily obscuring the weathered faces peering from within. 

Seraphina adjusted the pommel of her sword, the chill metal a stark contrast to the sweat slicking her palms.  This was no ordinary caravan passing through Eldoria's gates. The wagons were laden with unfamiliar goods - brightly-coloured silks and spices that spoke of lands beyond the known world. And the riders... their faces held a guarded intensity, eyes darting nervously at every shadow, every creak of the ancient city walls. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the courtyard, turning the already imposing structures into menacing giants. The air hung thick with the scent of woodsmoke and distant rain, a prelude to the storm brewing both within the city's heart and upon the horizon.  


Eldoria, a city built upon layered stone and steeped in secrets, was on edge. A shadow had fallen across its once vibrant streets, whispers of unrest circulating like a poisonous wind. Seraphina Thorne knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that this caravan, with its mysterious cargo and anxious riders, might just be the catalyst for the storm to come.
