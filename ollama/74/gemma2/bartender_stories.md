The air in "The Rusty Mug" was thick with the scent of stale beer and regret. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the already dim streetlights outside into halos of yellow. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, known affectionately as "Amy" to regulars, wiped down a sticky countertop, her movements practiced and efficient. She could tell by the hunched shoulders and furrowed brows that tonight was another slow one, filled with stories told in hushed whispers and drowned out by the rhythmic clinking of ice cubes in worn tumblers. Amy knew these patrons like old friends, each one carrying their own burdens, seeking solace in the amber glow of a well-made whiskey or the temporary escape offered by cheap beer.  

The Rusty Mug wasn't glamorous, but it was a haven for the weary, the lost, and the lonely. It was Amy's haven too, a place where she could blend into the background, pour drinks, listen, and offer silent support. Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, a whisper of unease that had nothing to do with the usual Friday night melancholy.  It was as if a storm was brewing not just outside, but within the very walls of The Rusty Mug.
