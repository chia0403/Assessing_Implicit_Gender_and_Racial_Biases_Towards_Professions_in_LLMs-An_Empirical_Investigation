Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the tempest raging within her own mind. The stark white walls, usually calming, seemed to press in on her, amplifying the echoing silence that followed the phone call.  "Dr. Vance," the voice had rasped, "I think I might be losing my grip."

Eleanor rubbed a weary hand over her tired eyes. Her office, perched high above the city on the 42nd floor of a nondescript building, was usually a sanctuary – a place where she could dissect the complexities of human behavior and find order in the chaos. But today, the rain, the unsettling phone call, and the weight of a particularly grueling case had conspired to create an atmosphere thick with unease.  

The "grip" the caller mentioned belonged to Michael Thorne, a former police detective turned private investigator. He was embroiled in a case that felt deeply personal – tracking down his missing wife, believed to be abducted by a serial killer known only as The Puppeteer. 


This wasn't just another routine consult for Eleanor.  Thorne had confided in her before, revealing his crippling anxiety and the nightmares plaguing him since his wife’s disappearance. She had tried to help him, offering coping mechanisms and strategies to navigate his trauma, but something about this new plea felt different – more desperate, more fractured. 

As the rain continued its relentless assault, Eleanor leaned back in her chair, a knot of worry tightening in her stomach.  Thorne’s case was already pushing her boundaries; now, it threatened to swallow her whole.
