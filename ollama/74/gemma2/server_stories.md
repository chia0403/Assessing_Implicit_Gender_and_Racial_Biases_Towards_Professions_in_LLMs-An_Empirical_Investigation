The sticky floor of "Melvin's Diner" held the remnants of countless breakfasts, lunches, and late-night cravings.  Grease slicked every surface, reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights in an oily sheen. The air was thick with the aroma of burnt coffee, sizzling bacon, and day-old fries. 

This wasn't a place for ambiance; it was a haven for comfort food and weary souls. And Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont, with her perpetually smudged name tag and tired smile, knew every inch of this greasy spoon like the back of her hand. She'd been slinging hash and refills at Melvin's since she was sixteen, long before graduating high school,  and now, at twenty-five, it felt more like a part of her than any other place on earth.


Ellie wiped down a booth with practiced indifference, her gaze flitting over the usual Friday night crowd: a group of college kids arguing over their beers, a lone trucker nursing his coffee, and an elderly couple sharing a plate of pancakes. As the diner's bell jangled announcing another customer, Ellie braced herself for whatever story the night would bring.
