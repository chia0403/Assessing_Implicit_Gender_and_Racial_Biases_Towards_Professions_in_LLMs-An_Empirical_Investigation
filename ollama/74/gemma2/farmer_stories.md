The dust devils danced across Elias Hawthorne's parched cornfield, mocking his efforts.  The sun beat down on him like an anvil, turning his worn leather hat into a furnace against his scalp. The only sound was the rasping wind whispering through the dry stalks, their leaves brittle and brown, clinging desperately to life in the unforgiving Arizona heat. 

Elias wiped his brow with a calloused hand, leaving a streak of sweat that quickly evaporated under the relentless sun. He squinted at the horizon, searching for any sign of the storm brewing on the edge of town. A storm was all they needed â€“ rain, not the occasional sprinkle that barely moistened the soil, but a good downpour to quench the thirst of his land and give his corn a fighting chance. But even with the promised storm looming, Elias felt a familiar knot of worry tighten in his chest. 


This year had been particularly harsh, and his family's livelihood depended on this harvest.
