The air hung thick with the scent of brine and salt as Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Brighton surveyed her flock of tourists, a motley crew of wide-eyed travelers gathered on the rickety pier at Port Royal. Seagulls squawked overhead, their cries weaving between the rhythmic slap of waves against weathered pilings. The Jamaican sun beat down relentlessly, turning Amy's already freckled nose a shade deeper crimson. 

Amy adjusted the brim of her straw hat, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that dared to escape its braid. "Alright, everyone!" she called out, her voice carrying over the din. "Welcome to Port Royal! Jamaica’s legendary pirate haven, steeped in history and haunted by whispers of buried treasure." 

Her gaze swept across the faces before her: a gaggle of retirees clutching their cameras, a group of teenagers boredly chewing gum, and a lone, bespectacled man who seemed utterly engrossed in a tattered map. Amy knew this tour well – every cobblestone, every crumbling building held a story waiting to be told. But beneath the familiar excitement thrummed a quiet unease.  Today felt different, charged with an almost tangible anticipation. A prickling sensation crawled up her spine, leaving her wondering if it was just the heat or something more… sinister.
