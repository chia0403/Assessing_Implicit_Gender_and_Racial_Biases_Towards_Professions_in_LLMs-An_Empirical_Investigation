Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek Elementary, mimicking the storm brewing inside Amelia Rosethorn's chest. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over her cluttered office, where half-finished paperwork and forgotten snacks lay scattered like casualties of war. Outside, the wind howled, tearing at the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel outside her window. 

Amelia sighed, rubbing her weary eyes. She'd been at this for hours – sorting through behavioral reports, navigating delicate conversations with distraught parents, and attempting to untangle the emotional knots of a student body grappling with their own anxieties.  It was always like this during finals week – a pressure cooker of stress and fear. 

But today felt different. A gnawing sense of unease had settled over her since morning, an intuition whispering that something was amiss. She couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just another typical week in the chaotic life of a school psychologist. Something deeper, darker, lurked beneath the surface.  


And she had a feeling it wouldn't be long before it came to light.
