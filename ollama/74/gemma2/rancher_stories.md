The sun beat down on Amelia Rose Blackwood’s neck like a blacksmith’s hammer, each drop of sweat clinging to her skin like a tiny, salty bead. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, kicking up red grit that settled on everything – the weathered pickup truck, the rusty fence posts, even Amelia’s faded denim overalls. The air hung heavy with the scent of sunbaked leather and sagebrush, punctuated by the occasional sharp bleat of a wayward lamb. 

Amelia squinted at the horizon, searching for any sign of movement amongst the rolling hills. The drought had been relentless this year, turning their once lush pastures into cracked, brittle reminders of greener times. It was getting harder to find water, harder to keep the herd healthy, and harder still to keep hope alive.


But Amelia Rose Blackwood wasn't one to give up easily. This land, her family’s legacy for generations, ran in her blood as surely as the dust did through her veins.
