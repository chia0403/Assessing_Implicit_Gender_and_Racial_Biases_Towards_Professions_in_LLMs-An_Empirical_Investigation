The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Amelia Claire Hawthorne's tidy office, dust motes dancing in the golden beams that sliced through the blinds.  A faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer lingered in the air, a constant reminder of the invisible world she navigated every day â€“ the one teeming with anxieties, neuroses, and unspoken terrors. 

Amelia surveyed her waiting room: a worn leather armchair sat facing a framed print of a serene beach scene, perpetually mocking the storm brewing within some of her patients. Her receptionist, Martha, a woman whose life seemed to be governed by routine and herbal tea, was meticulously alphabetizing brochures on stress management techniques. The rhythmic click of her pen echoed through the room, a counterpoint to the anxious hum in Amelia's chest. Today was different. Today, she had a patient who promised to unravel something deeper, something that reached beyond the usual anxieties and fears.


A young woman, barely more than a girl, entered the waiting room, her shoulders hunched as if carrying an invisible weight. Her eyes darted nervously around the room, finally settling on Amelia's door with a flicker of fear.  This wasn't just another case file for Amelia to dissect; this was a puzzle she couldn't ignore. A puzzle that threatened to pull her into its dark depths.
