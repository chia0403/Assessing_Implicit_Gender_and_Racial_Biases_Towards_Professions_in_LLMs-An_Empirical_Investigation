The salt spray stung Amelia “Ace” Thorne’s face as she gripped the controls of her aging Cessna 172, the wind whipping strands of fiery red hair across her vision.  She squinted at the approaching storm clouds gathering on the horizon, their dark bellies pregnant with rain and lightning.  Below, the turquoise waters of the Aegean Sea churned restlessly, mirroring the turmoil brewing in Ace’s gut.

This wasn't a typical flight for Ace. A seasoned pilot known for her daring aerial stunts and record-breaking cross-continent flights, she was usually navigating vast open skies, not confined to this tiny island off the coast of Greece. But desperation had a way of forcing even the most fearless to take unexpected routes.  

Her grandfather's call, crackled over the radio moments before, had been chillingly brief: "Come back, Ace. The artifact is in danger." His words hung heavy in the air, laced with urgency and a veiled fear she hadn't heard in his voice before. 


Ace adjusted her headset, the familiar weight of responsibility settling on her shoulders. This wasn't just another thrill ride; it was a mission to protect something far more precious than just herself.  She pushed the throttle forward, the Cessna responding with a reluctant roar, battling against the gathering storm and the gnawing anxiety in Ace’s heart.
