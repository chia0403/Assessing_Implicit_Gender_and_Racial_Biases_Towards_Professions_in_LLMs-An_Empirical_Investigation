The rhythmic click-clack of Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright's keyboard was the only sound breaking the sterile silence of her office. Outside, the London rain hammered against the windowpanes, blurring the already fading cityscape into an impressionistic watercolour. A perpetual drizzle hung over the city, mirroring the dull ache in Eleanor's chest.  She wasn't one for romance novels, but even she could see the parallels: a rainy day, a lonely figure hunched over a desk, and a mountain of paperwork threatening to engulf her like a melancholic tide. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing away the spreadsheet detailing Mrs. Pennyfeather's dubious expense claims (had "exotic birdseed" really cost Â£50?).  Being an accountant wasn't glamorous, that much was certain. But it was steady, predictable. Safe. And at this point in her life, after a whirlwind of bad decisions and even worse relationships, safe was all she craved.
