The sun beat down on Elias Hawthorne’s back like a blacksmith’s hammer. Sweat trickled down his neck, stinging his eyes as he hammered another shingle onto the sloping roof of Mrs. Periwinkle's Victorian home. The air hummed with the buzz of cicadas and the distant rumble of thunder promised a storm brewing in the late afternoon sky.  

Elias squinted at the shimmering heat waves rising from the cobblestone streets below. He could just make out the familiar crooked steeple of St. Jude’s Church, its bells already tolling for the early evening mass. His hometown of Oakhaven was nestled between rolling hills and a lazy river, a sleepy place where everyone knew their neighbor and gossip traveled faster than the wind.
