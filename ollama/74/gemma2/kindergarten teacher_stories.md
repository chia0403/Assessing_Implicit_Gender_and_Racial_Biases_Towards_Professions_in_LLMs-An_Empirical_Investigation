The scent of cinnamon and playdough hung heavy in the air, a comforting blend Amelia Rose Hawthorne had come to associate with the beginning of any school day. Sunlight streamed through the large windows of her brightly colored kindergarten classroom, illuminating rows of miniature chairs and tables scattered with crayons, building blocks, and half-finished drawings depicting fantastical creatures.  Amelia surveyed the scene with a smile, her heart swelling with the familiar anticipation of another year filled with laughter, learning, and the boundless energy of five-year-olds.

But today, something felt different. A quiet hum of unease buzzed beneath the surface of the usual morning chaos. It started with Liam, usually the first one through the door, giggling and waving his dinosaur plushie. He stood awkwardly by the welcome mat, clutching a crumpled note in his hand, eyes downcast. Then came Maya, her vibrant pink tutu dragging on the floor as she stared intently at her shoes, avoiding eye contact with Amelia.  

Amelia's smile faltered. This wasn't their usual bubbly, boisterous selves. Something was amiss, and Amelia Rose Hawthorne, kindergarten teacher extraordinaire, knew it was time to put on her detective hat.
