The humid Florida air hung thick as molasses, clinging to Elias Blackwood’s sweat-slicked skin even under the awning of the bleachers. Palm trees swayed languidly in the breeze, their fronds rustling like gossip. Cicadas chirped a relentless symphony, a soundtrack to the simmering tension that had settled over the Cypress Bay High School football field.  

Elias, head coach for five grueling seasons now, watched his team through narrowed eyes. The scrimmage was supposed to be about strategy, about ironing out the kinks before their first game against rival Miami Lakes. Instead, it felt like a battlefield where egos clashed louder than any whistle blast. 


He ran a hand through his close-cropped grey hair, a sigh escaping his lips. This wasn’t how he envisioned his final season playing out. He was tired, bone weary from the endless hours spent honing young minds and bodies, but this team… they were different. A tangled mess of potential, fueled by insecurity and simmering resentment. Could Elias coax them into something resembling a cohesive unit before it was too late?
