The scent of peppermint oil and lavender hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of eucalyptus that permeated Dr. Eleanor Beaumont's office. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness before her first patient arrived. Outside, the bustling energy of downtown Seattle thrummed against the quiet haven she’d created.  Eleanor smoothed down her crisp white scrubs, adjusting the silver stethoscope around her neck – a thoughtful gift from her grandmother, a retired nurse who had instilled in Eleanor a deep sense of compassion and a love for healing. 

It was a new day, filled with the promise of aligning spines, easing pain, and helping people rediscover their natural balance. Eleanor took a deep breath, savoring the quiet before the inevitable symphony of clicks, pops, and grateful sighs that would soon fill her space.
