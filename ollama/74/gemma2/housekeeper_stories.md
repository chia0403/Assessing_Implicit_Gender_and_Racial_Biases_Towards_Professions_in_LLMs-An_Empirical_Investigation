The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of the grand Victorian manor, casting long shadows across the polished oak floors.  Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick, her thin frame dwarfed by the cavernous hallways, meticulously dusted a chipped porcelain figurine perched precariously on a marble mantelpiece. Her movements were precise, economical, years spent in service to others etching a quiet grace into each gesture. The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender polish and the faint, lingering aroma of Earl Grey tea - remnants of the aristocratic family that resided here, vanished now for almost a year.

Eleanor paused, her gaze drifting towards the boarded-up portrait gallery. Rumors whispered through the servants' quarters about the reason behind their sudden departure: a chilling curse, an inheritance gone awry, or perhaps something even more sinister. Whatever the truth, the manor stood silent, a mausoleum of faded grandeur and whispered secrets, waiting for its next chapter to unfold.  And Eleanor, the solitary caretaker, felt increasingly uneasy as if she were not merely cleaning dust but brushing away the veil between reality and something else entirely.
