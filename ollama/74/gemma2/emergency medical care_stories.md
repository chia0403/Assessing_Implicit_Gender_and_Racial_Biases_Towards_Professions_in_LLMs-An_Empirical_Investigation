The acrid bite of burnt rubber and gasoline filled Eleanor Grace Hawthorne's nostrils as she peeled into the crowded intersection. Her ambulance, lights blazing like predatory eyes in the twilight gloom, weaved through the sea of brake lights and honking horns. A radio crackle jolted her back to the present â€“ dispatch was calling out details about a multi-car pileup on the interstate, three reported injured with possible spinal trauma. 

Eleanor gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the worn leather. This was why she signed up for this chaos, why she became an EMT -  to be the first line of defense in the face of disaster. She wasn't a hero, not really. Just a woman who believed that everyone deserved a fighting chance, even when they were caught between speeding metal and shattered glass. 

The interstate was a tangled mess of twisted steel and flashing lights. Eleanor navigated the scene with practiced ease, her eyes scanning for the most critically injured patient. This wasn't her first rodeo, but the raw energy of panic that hung heavy in the air always had a way of tightening her stomach.  As sirens wailed and adrenaline surged, she reminded herself: Breathe. Assess. Act. That was all that mattered right now.
