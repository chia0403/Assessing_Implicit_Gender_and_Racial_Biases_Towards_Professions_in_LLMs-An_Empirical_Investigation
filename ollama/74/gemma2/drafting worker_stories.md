The humid air hung heavy in Amelia "Amy" Thistlewick's lungs as she hunched over her drafting table. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. Her office, Room 307 on the third floor of The Grand Foundry Building, was a claustrophobic space crammed with blueprints, half-eaten lunches, and discarded coffee cups. The constant clanging of machinery from the foundry below punctuated the rhythmic hum of Amy's drafting tools – the clickety-clack of her T-square against the drafting board, the rasp of her pencil lead against paper. 

Amy had spent the better part of a decade hunched over these very plans, meticulously translating the engineer's vision into tangible, measured lines and curves. Today, she was tasked with redesigning the gearbox for the newest model of steam engine – a monumental undertaking that could either catapult The Grand Foundry to new heights of success or send it tumbling down in flames.  

Outside, the bustling city of New Manchester churned on, oblivious to Amy's silent struggle within her cramped office. It was a city fueled by industry, a crucible where ambition and innovation clashed with grit and desperation. But for now, all that mattered was the blueprint spread before her, the ticking clock, and the weight of responsibility pressing down on Amy's shoulders like an anvil.
