The scent of lilies, heavy and sweet, hung in the air like a promise. It was always strongest on Tuesdays, when Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewood received her weekly delivery from Holland. 

Eleanor adjusted her glasses, peering down at the boxes stacked precariously on the counter of her tiny shop, 'Petal & Thorn'. Sunlight streamed through the dusty storefront window, illuminating the vibrant chaos within: orchids in pastel hues perched beside sunflowers bursting with golden energy, and delicate sprigs of rosemary nestled amongst sturdy stems of lavender. It was a symphony of color and fragrance, but Eleanor knew it wouldn't last long. This Tuesday felt different. The air thrummed with an unspoken tension, and even the bees buzzing around the geraniums seemed agitated. 


Eleanor took a deep breath, her heart pounding a frantic rhythm against her ribs. It was going to be another busy day in the heart of Willow Creek, and this time, she had a feeling it would be anything but ordinary.
