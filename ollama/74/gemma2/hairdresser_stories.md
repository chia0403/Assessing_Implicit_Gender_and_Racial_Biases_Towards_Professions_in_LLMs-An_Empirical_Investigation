The air hung thick with the scent of chamomile and lavender, a comforting cloud that usually soothed Seraphina Rosepetal’s nerves.  But today, even the aroma couldn't mask the tremor in her fingers as she gripped the shears. Her tiny salon, tucked away on a cobblestone street in Edinburgh's Old Town, was quieter than usual. 

The morning sun slanted through the stained-glass window, casting rainbows onto the worn wooden floor. Seraphina’s gaze lingered on the chipped paint of the windowsill, her reflection staring back – tired eyes framed by unruly auburn curls, a forced smile playing on pale lips.  She wasn't just battling a fear of messing up Mrs. MacDougall's elaborate updo for the Queen's Garden Party; she was wrestling with a storm of doubt that threatened to engulf her entire world. 


This morning, Seraphina Rosepetal, Edinburgh’s most sought-after hairstylist, felt like anything but a success.
