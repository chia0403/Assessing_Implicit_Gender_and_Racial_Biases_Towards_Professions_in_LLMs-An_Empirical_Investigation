The rain hammered against the windowpane, a relentless rhythm echoing the beat of Amelia Beatrice Thorne's anxieties.  Outside, London blurred into a watercolour wash of greys and greens, mirroring the disquiet swirling inside her. 

Amelia, normally a creature of crisp white shirts and organized chaos, was draped in a moth-eaten dressing gown, hair pulled back haphazardly with a chipped jade scrunchie. The manuscript lay open on her desk, its pages bathed in the cold light of her laptop screen. It wasn't just any manuscript - it was "The Serpent's Shadow," the debut novel by an unknown author with a name that sounded more like a fairytale princess than a gritty crime thriller writer: Guinevere Elmsworth. 

Guinevere had promised a story that would leave readers breathless, haunted by its dark secrets and twisting plot lines. Amelia, however, was struggling to find her breath. This wasn't the thrilling page-turner she'd been promised; it felt amateurish, riddled with inconsistencies and clunky dialogue. 


The clock ticked past midnight, each click a tiny hammer blow against Amelia's dwindling hope that this debut wouldn't be another disappointment in a career already filled with them. She rubbed her eyes, willing herself to focus, but the words on the page seemed to swim before her.  She needed a break. 

But where could she go in this storm-lashed city at this hour? And more importantly, could she bear to face anyone after delivering this crushing news to Guinevere?
