The bell above the door to the Blackwood Public Library tinkled like wind chimes on a summer breeze, announcing Eleanor Thistlewick's arrival.  She smoothed down her emerald green cardigan, adjusting the tiny spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose. The library, with its soaring ceilings and oak-panelled walls lined with dusty tomes, was her sanctuary, a world of hushed whispers and the comforting scent of aged paper. 

The afternoon sun cast long shadows through the arched windows, illuminating motes of dust that danced in the air like tiny fireflies. Eleanor loved this time of day, when the library settled into a peaceful lull between the morning rush of school children and the evening influx of eager readers.  She surveyed her domain, her gaze sweeping over the meticulously arranged shelves and the worn armchairs tucked into cozy corners. 

Outside, the town of Blackwood bustled with life, but within these walls, time seemed to stand still. It was a place where stories whispered from ancient pages and imagination soared on the wings of a well-worn novel. Eleanor Thistlewick, Head Librarian of Blackwood, knew every nook and cranny of this hallowed space. But today, she sensed something different. A subtle shift in the air, like the premonition of an approaching storm.
