The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Blackwood’s head, casting a sterile glow over her cramped office. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst, a familiar blend she’d come to associate with her role as guidance counselor at Northgate High. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, creating a melancholic soundtrack to the afternoon lull. 

A crumpled tissue lay on the corner of her desk, next to a half-empty mug of lukewarm tea. Amelia sighed, pushing back the auburn tendrils that had escaped her braid and glanced at the clock. It was 2:30 pm, well past when most students would be huddled in their classrooms, enduring the tedium of algebra or English Literature. The only one scheduled for a meeting with her was Ethan Davies, but he was habitually late.

Amelia wasn't entirely surprised. Ethan had become a regular fixture in her office, his anxiety-ridden visits a tapestry woven from parental pressure, academic uncertainty, and the pervasive fear of failing to live up to expectations.  His file lay open on her desk, filled with detailed notes about his struggles: grades that fluctuated between mediocre and abysmal, extracurricular activities abandoned mid-year, and an unsettling silence whenever she asked him about his future aspirations. 


Amelia hoped today would be different. Perhaps the rain was a sign of change, washing away some of Ethan's anxieties and allowing him to finally speak his mind. Or maybe she was just clinging to hope, fueled by caffeine and the quiet hum of her fluorescent lights.
