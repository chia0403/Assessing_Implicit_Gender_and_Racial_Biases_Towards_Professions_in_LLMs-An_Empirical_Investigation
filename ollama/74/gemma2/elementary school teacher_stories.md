The scent of stale crayons and glue hung heavy in Ms. Eleanor Finch’s classroom. It was a familiar aroma that usually brought her comfort – a tangible reminder of the small hands creating worlds on construction paper, the boisterous laughter echoing through the halls during recess, and the quiet satisfaction of guiding young minds. 

But today, the scent felt oppressive, mirroring the heavy weight in Eleanor's chest. Her classroom at Willow Creek Elementary, usually a vibrant kaleidoscope of colors and student artwork, was shrouded in an unsettling stillness. The absence of the usual morning chaos, the missing blur of tiny feet rushing through the door, only amplified the silence. 


Eleanor pushed aside the pile of unfinished lesson plans on her desk and stared out the window at the empty playground.  The bright October sun cast long shadows across the field, a stark contrast to the unsettling quiet that permeated her classroom. Something was wrong, terribly wrong, and Eleanor’s heart pounded with a growing sense of dread.
