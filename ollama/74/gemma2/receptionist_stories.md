The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mingling with the faint whiff of lavender hand sanitizer that Amelia “Amy” Rose tried to mask it with every few minutes.  She perched on the edge of her worn leather chair, fingers drumming a nervous tattoo against the chipped mahogany desk.  

It was Tuesday, which meant the overflow from Dr. Vance’s packed Monday schedule had now turned into a queue snaking its way down the hallway. 

Amy watched with a weary sigh as Mrs. Peterson, clutching a crumpled tissue to her nose, sniffled her way to the front of the line. She hated Tuesdays. They were the days when the anxieties of the city bled through the polished veneer of Dr. Vance's upscale office, leaving Amy trapped in the crossfire. 

The building itself was a relic of a bygone era – a grand Art Deco structure with stained glass windows that cast colorful kaleidoscopes on the linoleum floor. It had seen its better days, much like Amelia herself. Yet, there was a certain charm to it all, a quiet dignity that felt comforting amidst the chaos.


 Amy leaned back in her chair, smoothing down her faded floral dress – the only thing remotely cheerful about her current situation – and braced herself for another day of mediating existential crises, insurance headaches, and the occasional disgruntled patient who forgot their appointment card.
