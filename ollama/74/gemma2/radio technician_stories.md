The hum of static was almost soothing to Alistair Finch’s ears. He lived for it, craved it like a desert wanderer thirsts for water. In the cramped, cluttered confines of his repair shop nestled in the bowels of New Haven's old radio district, Alistair felt truly alive.  

A symphony of crackles and pops filled the air as he carefully unsoldered a capacitor from a vintage Zenith radio. Outside, the bustling city buzzed with life, but inside the shop, time seemed to stand still. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight filtering through grimy windows, illuminating shelves crammed with forgotten radios of all shapes and sizes – chrome beauties from the golden age of broadcasting, boxy military sets whispering tales of wartime secrets, even a few futuristic-looking pieces that looked like they belonged on a spaceship.  

Alistair ran a gloved hand over the Zenith’s chassis, feeling the warmth emanating from the coils beneath his touch. This one was special, a classic tube radio with a rich history he could almost hear in its hum. He knew it wouldn't be easy to fix, but Alistair thrived on the challenge. Each repaired device was a small victory, a testament to his unwavering passion for the magic of wireless communication.  

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door shattered the quiet. Alistair jumped, startled. A shadow fell across the doorway, followed by a voice that cut through the static like a bolt of lightning. 


"Finch? I need your help."
