The faint scent of lavender and almond oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the rhythmic whirring of the electric file as Esmeralda "Esme" Bellini worked her magic on Mrs. Henderson's chipped crimson nails.  Her tiny salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in Greenwich Village, was a haven from the bustling city outside. Walls lined with vintage nail polish bottles and framed botanical prints created a cozy, feminine atmosphere. Sunbeams streamed through the lace curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air. 

Esme hummed along to Billie Holiday crooning softly from the radio, her nimble fingers expertly shaping the acrylics on Mrs. Henderson's nails into elegant almond tips. A smile played on her lips as she listened to Mrs. Henderson recount her latest escapade â€“ a disastrous blind date involving a misplaced toupee and an overzealous flamenco performance. 


But Esme's peaceful bubble was about to burst.  A jarring clang from the back room shattered the tranquility, followed by a muffled curse.
