The hum of the centrifuges was a lullaby to Dr. Amelia Blythe. For ten years, she'd lived amongst these machines in her cramped lab on the outskirts of Seattle, a world away from the city's vibrant energy and bustling streets.  Her days were spent hunched over microscopes, deciphering the secrets held within petri dishes filled with alien flora harvested from the crash site five years ago. 

It wasn't glamorous work, but Amelia was driven by a singular purpose: understanding the nature of the "bloom" – an invasive plant species that had sprung from the wreckage and rapidly overtaken swathes of Pacific Northwest wilderness. It wasn't just its rapid growth or vibrant, almost hypnotic colours that worried her; it was the way it seemed to react to human emotion, growing stronger in areas of fear and despair.  Amelia believed the key to stopping the bloom lay within its cellular structure, a puzzle she was determined to solve, one microscopic analysis at a time. 


The lab itself was a testament to Amelia's dedication – cluttered but meticulously organized, with shelves laden with jars containing preserved samples of the bloom in various stages of growth.  Faded photographs of her late husband, a botanist who had been killed by the bloom during its initial outbreak, adorned her desk, serving as a constant reminder of both the danger and the allure of her research.
