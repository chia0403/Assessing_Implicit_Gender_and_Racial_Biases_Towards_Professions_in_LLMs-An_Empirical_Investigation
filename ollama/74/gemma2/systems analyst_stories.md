The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor "Ellie" Vance, casting a sterile glow over the rows of identical workstations in the sprawling IT department of Zenith Corporation. Outside, Chicago pulsed with life – a symphony of car horns and sirens, punctuated by the distant wail of an ambulance. But inside this air-conditioned fortress of logic and code, time seemed to exist in a different dimension. 

Ellie tapped her fingers against the keyboard, her eyes glued to the scrolling lines of text on her monitor. A complex algorithm was throwing errors she couldn't decipher. Her brow furrowed as she traced the lines of code, searching for the rogue variable that was throwing everything into chaos. This wasn't just a simple bug – it threatened to bring down Zenith's entire customer database, a behemoth containing millions of sensitive records. 

It was past midnight, and the only other person in the department was Frank, the overnight janitor, who shuffled by with his mop bucket every hour or so, offering the occasional grunt of acknowledgement. Ellie ignored him, her focus laser-sharp on the screen. She couldn't afford to lose this battle. Not now.
