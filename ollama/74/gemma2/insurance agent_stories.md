The fluorescent lights hummed above Arthur Bartholomew Perkins III like a chorus of disgruntled bees, casting a sickly yellow glow on his cramped office. A lone potted fern, struggling to survive in the corner, seemed to echo Arthur's own feelings: parched, unloved, and desperate for a change of scenery.

And Art, bless his soul, craved predictability like a moth craves a flickering flame. 


Then, the phone rang. A shrill, piercing sound that shattered the dull rhythm of Arthur's day and sent a shiver down his spine. He knew, with a sinking feeling in his gut, that this call was anything but ordinary. This call would change everything.
