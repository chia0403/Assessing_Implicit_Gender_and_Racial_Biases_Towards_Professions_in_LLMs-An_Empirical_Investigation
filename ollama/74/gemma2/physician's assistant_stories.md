The air in Mercy General's ER hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and anxiety. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the hurried movements of nurses, the gurneys lined against the wall like casualties in a silent war, and the pale faces etched with worry that always seemed to gather here. 

Eliza "Liz" Hayes, her name tag clipped neatly to her blue scrubs, navigated the chaos with practiced ease.  Years as a Physician's Assistant had honed her senses to pick out the subtle cues: a tremor in a hand, the frantic blinking of an eye, a cough that spoke volumes about something more than just a cold. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the usual din, like a live wire waiting to spark. Liz chalked it up to the early shift fatigue and the influx of weekend injuries, but a prickle of unease ran down her spine. She scanned the faces around her, looking for the source of the disquiet.  Then, a new patient was wheeled in, pale and unconscious, his chest rising and falling with shallow breaths. A knot tightened in Liz's stomach. This wasn't just another routine case. 


This felt like the beginning of something bigger.
