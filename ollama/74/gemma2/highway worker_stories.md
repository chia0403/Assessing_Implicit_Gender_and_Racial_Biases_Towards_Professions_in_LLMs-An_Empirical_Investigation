The sun hadn't even begun to think about rising over the Arizona desert when Elias "Eli" Reyes already felt its heat against his back.  He was hunched over his usual spot on the shoulder of I-10, fiddling with a loose section of guardrail near mile marker 247. Dust motes danced in the pre-dawn light filtering through the skeletal branches of a lone palo verde tree beside him.

Eliâ€™s worn canvas gloves were already slick with sweat, and his breath puffed out in small white clouds against the crisp desert air.  He could hear the distant rumble of an eighteen-wheeler heading east, its headlights slicing through the darkness like pale moons. Another day, another stretch of highway to mend before the sun fully claimed the sky. It was a lonely job, but it was his, and Eli took pride in the small patches of order he brought to this chaotic expanse of asphalt.
