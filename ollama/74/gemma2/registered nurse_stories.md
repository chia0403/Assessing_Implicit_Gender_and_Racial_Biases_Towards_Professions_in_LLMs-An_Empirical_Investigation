The fluorescent lights buzzed like agitated bees above Amelia Beatrice Hayes' head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the ER waiting room. It was past midnight, the air thick with the mingled scents of disinfectant, stale coffee, and desperation. Amelia, her name tag reading 'R.N. Hayes,' sat perched on a metal stool behind the nurses' station, idly flipping through a dog-eared copy of "Wuthering Heights." The lull in patients had left her adrift in a sea of quiet punctuated by the occasional cough or frantic whisper from the waiting families huddled in mismatched chairs. 

The stillness felt unnatural, like a calm before a storm.  Amelia knew it wouldn't last. The ER was always a tempestuous beast, its rhythm dictated by the unpredictable chaos of human life. But tonight, there was an undercurrent of tension, a prickling awareness that something was about to change. And when it did, she knew she would be right in the eye of it.
