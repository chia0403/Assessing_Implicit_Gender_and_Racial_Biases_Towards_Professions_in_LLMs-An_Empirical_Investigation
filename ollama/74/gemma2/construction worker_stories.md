The air hung thick with dust, sweat, and the metallic tang of freshly cut steel. Sunlight beat down on Bartholomew "Big Bart" McTavish's weathered neck as he squinted at the rising skeleton of the skyscraper.  It was a monstrous thing, clawing its way into the bruised grey sky above downtown Phoenix. Every clang of hammer against rebar, every whirring of the concrete mixer, echoed in Big Bart's bones like a familiar rhythm, a song of progress and sweat. He wiped his brow with a grimy rag, leaving a streak of grime across his already dust-covered face. This wasn't just another job for him; it was a monument to grit, a testament to the city's unyielding ambition, and a personal challenge he wouldn't let fail. 


The year is 2047, Phoenix has swelled beyond its desert borders, becoming a concrete jungle of towering structures that pierce the horizon. The heat is relentless, the air often hazy with dust from construction sites and the ever-present scent of creosote.  Big Bart's crew works on this behemoth called "Phoenix Ascent," a skyscraper destined to be the tallest in the city, a symbol of progress amidst the scorching desert landscape.
