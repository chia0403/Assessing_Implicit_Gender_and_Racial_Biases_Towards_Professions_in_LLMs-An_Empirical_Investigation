The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the blood-stained gauze squares scattered across Amelia Beatrice Finch's countertop.  A faint scent of antiseptic hung in the air, mingling with the cloying sweetness of spilled cherry Kool-Aid that had somehow become a constant fixture in her cubicle.

Amelia sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. Her small work space felt like a microcosm of the entire hospital: chaotic, perpetually understaffed, and humming with a low-level anxiety only seasoned healthcare professionals truly understood.  She hated Mondays, especially Mondays that involved mandatory training on a new vein-finding technique called "The Butterfly Approach." The name sounded whimsical, Amelia thought, but the reality was likely to involve squirming patients and a lot of accidental pokes. 

Just then, the door swung open with its usual pneumatic groan and a harried nurse practically shoved a chart into her hands. “Finch,” she barked, “Ward Three needs blood ASAP. Triple draw on Johnson, stat!”  Amelia glanced at the chart – Mr. Harold Johnson, 72, complaining of chest pain – and swallowed hard. This was going to be one heck of a Monday.
