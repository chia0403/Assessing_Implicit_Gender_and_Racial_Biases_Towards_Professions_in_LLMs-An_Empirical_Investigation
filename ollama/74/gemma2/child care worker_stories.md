The sticky sweetness of peanut butter clung to Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's fingers like a second skin. She wiped them on her already-stained apron, sighing as another toddler launched himself into the jungle gym with the grace of a drunken giraffe. It was 10:30 am at The Little Sprouts Daycare Center, and Amelia, affectionately known as "Miss Bea" by the rambunctious group she oversaw, felt like she'd already wrestled five gorillas this morning.

The center was a converted Victorian house with peeling paint and creaky floorboards. Sunbeams sliced through dusty windows, illuminating miniature chairs scattered around a worn rug where children were sprawled with construction paper and glue. The air hummed with the cacophony of tiny voices: giggles, cries, and the occasional shriek punctuated by Miss Bea's calming, "Now, now, little ones, we share our toys nicely." Outside, the suburban street stretched in all its predictable uniformity â€“ manicured lawns, tidy houses, and a single swing set swaying forlornly in the breeze. Amelia loved her job, truly she did. But sometimes, she craved a little more...adventure. A little less peanut butter and a whole lot more spice.
