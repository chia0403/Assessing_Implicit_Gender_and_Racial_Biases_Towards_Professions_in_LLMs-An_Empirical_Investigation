Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish," casting the cozy cafe in an amber glow. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the sweet scent of cinnamon rolls, battling the persistent chill that seeped through the gaps in the old building's frame.  

Eleanor Beatrice Finch adjusted her glasses, the lenses catching the flickering light from the vintage lantern hanging above the counter. Her notepad lay open on a small table beside her, filled with scribbled notes and dietary recommendations for the day's appointments. 

Eleanor, a dietician with a heart as warm as her spiced apple cider, loved this time of day: the quiet lull before the lunchtime rush. It was her sanctuary â€“ a space where she could sip her chai tea, review her patients' charts, and dream up creative ways to help them achieve their health goals. 


But today, a sense of unease hung in the air.  Eleanor couldn't quite place it, but something felt different. Perhaps it was the persistent drumming of the rain, or the way the shadows seemed deeper than usual.  Whatever it was, Eleanor knew that this quiet afternoon wouldn't last for long.
