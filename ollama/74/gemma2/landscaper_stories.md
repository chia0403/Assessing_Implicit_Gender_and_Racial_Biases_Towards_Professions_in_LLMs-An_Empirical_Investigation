The sun beat down on Amelia Thistlewood's neck as she wrestled a stubborn juniper bush into submission. Sweat dripped from her brow, stinging her eyes, but she kept pushing, her muscles aching in familiar protest. The air hung thick with the smell of freshly cut grass and pine needles, punctuated by the occasional whirr of a lawnmower rumbling across the manicured lawns of Aspen Grove Estates. 

Amelia, or Amy as most people called her, had been landscaping these pristine suburban homes for five years now. It wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest, and she found a strange kind of peace in coaxing life out of the earth, transforming bare patches into vibrant gardens bursting with color. Today, however, the usual tranquility was shattered by a frantic call from Mrs. Davenport, her most demanding client, who claimed her prize-winning roses were being devoured by some unknown creature. 


The sprawling lawns and manicured hedges of Aspen Grove Estates were Ameliaâ€™s world. Each house a testament to wealth and order, each garden a miniature battlefield where she fought against weeds, pests, and the occasional disgruntled homeowner.
