The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and jasmine as Eloise Periwinkle knelt amidst the burgeoning rose bushes. Dew clung to her overalls like tiny diamonds, reflecting the pale sunrise filtering through the ancient oak trees lining the manor's borders. She hummed a tuneless melody, her fingers delicately pruning away browning stems, coaxing life from the velvety petals. 

Whispering Pines Manor stood behind her, a Victorian behemoth shrouded in an air of faded grandeur. The once vibrant paint peeled like sunburnt skin, revealing streaks of weathered gray beneath. Its sprawling lawns, tended to with meticulous care by Eloise's hands, were the only testament to the manor's past glory. The grand halls within lay mostly silent now, echoing with the ghosts of laughter and secrets whispered long ago. 


Eloise, though a woman of few words and even fewer possessions, held the manor in her heart as fiercely as any descendant who had walked these grounds before her. It was her sanctuary, her canvas, and she was its sole caretaker.
