Her fingers tapped impatiently against the worn wooden desk, her gaze flickering between the towering stacks of case files and the blinking cursor on her computer screen. Outside, the midday sun beat down on the glass facade of their modest law firm in downtown Chicago, casting a harsh glare that mirrored the tension churning within Sarah.
