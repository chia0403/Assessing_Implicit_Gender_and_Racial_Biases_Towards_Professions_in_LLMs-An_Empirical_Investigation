The whir of the industrial fan rasped against Amelia Thistlewick’s skull like a dull toothache.  Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the grime-coated window, illuminating a chaotic landscape of half-finished projects and empty takeout containers scattered across her work desk. A crumpled ball of paper bearing a scrawled “Rejected!” glared accusingly from beneath a tower of design books. 

Amelia, a graphic designer whose portfolio boasted more potential than realized success, sighed, pushing away the remnants of last night’s ramen noodles. Her deadline loomed like a hungry beast – tomorrow morning, she had to present her designs for the local bakery's new campaign to Mr. Fitzwilliam, the owner with a reputation for being as gruff and demanding as a sourdough starter left in the sun too long. 

The bakery, "Fitzwilliam's Fine Foods," was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a quaint town where time seemed to move at half-speed.  Cobblestone streets lined with pastel-colored Victorian houses whispered tales of bygone eras, and the air was perpetually thick with the aroma of freshly baked bread wafting from Mr. Fitzwilliam's shop. Despite its charm, Oakhaven felt stiflingly predictable – a feeling Amelia desperately needed to escape. Maybe landing this contract would be her ticket out, a chance to finally break free from the confines of small-town life and chase her dreams in the vibrant chaos of the city.


This was it, then. The moment everything changed, or perhaps remained stubbornly stagnant, just like the dust bunnies multiplying under her desk.
