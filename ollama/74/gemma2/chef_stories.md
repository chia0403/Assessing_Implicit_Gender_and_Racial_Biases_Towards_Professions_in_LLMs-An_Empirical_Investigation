The steam from the boiling lobster bisque swirled around Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne's face like a welcoming phantom, carrying with it the rich, briny scent that was both her comfort and her obsession. Amy stood in the heart of "The Crimson Tide," her own restaurant tucked away on a cobbled street in the historic district of Charleston, South Carolina. 

It was just past five o'clock on a Tuesday evening, the golden light of the setting sun filtering through the stained-glass windows and painting the worn wooden floorboards with kaleidoscopic hues. Outside, the air thrummed with the melody of cicadas and the distant hum of traffic, but inside "The Crimson Tide," time seemed to slow to the languid rhythm of simmering sauces and perfectly seasoned proteins. 


Amy, her brow furrowed in concentration as she adjusted the spice level of the bisque, was a woman carved from the very essence of Charleston: warm, vibrant, and steeped in tradition. Her flame-red hair, streaked with silver like the lining of an oyster shell, cascaded down her back, framing a face etched with the wisdom of years spent crafting culinary magic.
