The aroma of burnt coffee clung to Mrs. Eleanor Beaumont like a second skin.  She stared out the rain-streaked window of her classroom, watching the grey sky mirror the bleakness in her own soul. The bell for sixth period was about to ring, but Eleanor wasn't prepared. She hadn't been prepared all week. Her energy, usually vibrant and infectious, had dwindled to a flicker, consumed by the mounting pressure of deadlines, student apathy, and the relentless hum of loneliness that had become her constant companion.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered desks and faded posters, highlighting the emptiness that threatened to engulf her.

But today, even the flickering seemed dim.
