The air in "Flour & Fortune" hung thick with the scent of cardamom and warm yeast. Outside, the cobbled streets of Old Market shimmered under the relentless August sun, but inside, Amelia Thistlewick, or Millie as everyone called her, found solace in the cool embrace of her bakery. She kneaded a batch of sourdough with practiced hands, the rhythmic push and pull a soothing mantra against the day's anxieties. 

Millie wasn't just baking bread; she was weaving stories into every loaf.  Her croissants held whispers of Parisian mornings, her rye bread hummed with tales of Scandinavian winters, and her blueberry scones promised sunshine-drenched afternoons in Maine. She poured her heart into each creation, hoping to bring a little bit of magic into the lives of her customers. 


Today, however, magic seemed elusive. A thick fog had settled over the town, blanketing it in an eerie silence. Millie glanced nervously at the clock ticking above the counter â€“ nearly noon. Usually, by this time, Flour & Fortune would be bustling with eager patrons, but today, only a few stragglers dared to venture out into the unsettling stillness.  The fog wasn't just obscuring the sun; it seemed to muffle even the city's usual hum, leaving Millie feeling strangely isolated, adrift in an unexpected silence.
