The rain hammered against the windows of the dilapidated clinic, each drop a miniature explosion against the glass. Inside, Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne huddled deeper into her threadbare cardigan, the damp chill seeping through the thin walls. Her breath puffed out in white clouds as she scribbled notes on a patient's file – a young boy with a persistent cough and eyes too old for his seven years. 

The clinic, perched precariously on the edge of Salt Creek – a town swallowed by its own decay – was far from ideal. Its once-bright facade had been bleached by years of sun and neglect, the peeling paint a grim reminder of forgotten promises. The floorboards creaked with every step, and the scent of disinfectant mingled with the musty aroma of damp plaster. Despite it all, Amelia found solace in its familiar chaos. This wasn't just a clinic; it was her haven, her sanctuary amidst the desolation of Salt Creek. 


Here, she treated not just ailments but also hopes, dreams, and the quiet desperation that clung to the people like the ever-present dust.  And tonight, as the storm raged outside, Amelia felt the weight of Salt Creek's burdens settle heavily upon her shoulders.
