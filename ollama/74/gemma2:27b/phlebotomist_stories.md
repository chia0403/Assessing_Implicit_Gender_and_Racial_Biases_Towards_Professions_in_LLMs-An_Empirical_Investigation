The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile, unforgiving glow across the cramped waiting room. Eloise Cartwright, her nametag pinned slightly askew to her pale blue scrubs, sighed as she glanced at the clock. 3:47 pm. Only thirteen more minutes until her shift ended. A wave of nausea rose in her throat; another double shift, another afternoon spent dodging anxious glances and probing questions about needles.

She smoothed down the wrinkles on her forehead, trying to summon a semblance of cheerfulness as Mrs. Henderson shuffled towards her, clutching a crumpled paper form. Eloise plastered on her best smile, "Good afternoon, Mrs. Henderson! How can I help you today?" 


The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer - Eloise's futile attempt to mask the metallic tang that clung stubbornly to her scrubs. Outside, the late summer sun was setting, casting long shadows across the parking lot. Eloise longed for a cool breeze and the comforting sound of birdsong, anything but the incessant hum of the refrigerator holding blood samples and the muffled sobs emanating from cubicle three.
