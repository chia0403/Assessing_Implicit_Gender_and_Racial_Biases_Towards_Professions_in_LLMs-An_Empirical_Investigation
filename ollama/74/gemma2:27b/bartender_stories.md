The neon sign flickered, casting a sickly green glow across the rain-slicked cobblestones. It buzzed with a tired hum, spelling out "The Crooked Lantern" in chipped letters. Inside, Edgar Finch meticulously polished a highball glass, his movements practiced and precise. The air hung thick with the mingled scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and damp wool coats. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the view of the alleyway beyond.

Edgar wasn't sure what time it was anymore. His shift had started hours ago, melting into a haze of whispered confessions, drunken laughter, and spilled drinks. He knew most regulars by name and their usual poison: Maggie with her gin and tonic, Mr. Henderson with his scotch neat, the two construction workers who always argued over pool. Tonight, though, the bar was unusually quiet. Only a lone figure sat hunched at the counter, nursing a glass of something amber and unsettlingly still. 

Edgar squinted at the man through the grime on his glasses. He wore a long, dark coat that seemed to swallow him whole, the collar pulled high to obscure his face. A hat lay forgotten on the counter beside him, revealing a glimpse of unruly black hair streaked with silver. The man emanated an air of quiet menace, like a coiled serpent waiting to strike. Edgar hesitated, unsure whether to approach or leave him be.
