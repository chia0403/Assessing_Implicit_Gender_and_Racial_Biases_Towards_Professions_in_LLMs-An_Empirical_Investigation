The air in Madame Evangeline Dubois' atelier hung heavy with the scent of lavender and beeswax. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows overlooking Rue Cler, painting stripes across bolts of silk and velvet draped over antique mannequins.  Evangeline herself, her nimble fingers stained purple from a day spent dyeing silk organza, stood before a mirror, adjusting the pearl-encrusted bodice of a wedding gown. 

Paris in the summer was a tapestry woven with laughter, romance, and the constant thrumming of life. But for Evangeline, the city was also a crucible where dreams were forged and shattered. She yearned to create gowns that whispered stories, not just covered bodies. Gowns that would make women feel like goddesses, not simply brides.

Today, however, her muse felt distant. A letter lay crumpled on her worktable, its words echoing the disappointment in Evangeline's heart. The prestigious House of Moreau had rejected her application for an apprenticeship, citing "lack of experience" despite her years honing her craft in her tiny atelier.
