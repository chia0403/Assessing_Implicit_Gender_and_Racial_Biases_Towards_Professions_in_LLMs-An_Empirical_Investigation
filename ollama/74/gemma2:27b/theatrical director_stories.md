The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across Amelia Cavendish's cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of dog-eared scripts and half-empty teacups. The air hung thick with the scent of dust, old paper, and a faint whiff of lavender from the sachet tucked between her worn leather journal and a crumpled playbill. Outside, the London night pulsed with a symphony of rumbling carriages, distant shouts, and the rhythmic clop of horseshoes against cobblestones. 

Amelia chewed on the end of her pencil, her brow furrowed in concentration as she reread a passage from "The Masque of the Red Death."  Her latest production was proving more challenging than anticipated. The opulent setting, Prince Prospero's masked ball, felt strangely detached from the chilling horror unfolding within its gilded walls. She needed to bridge that gap, to make the audience feel not just the spectacle, but the palpable dread that crept through Poeâ€™s words.

A sudden rapping at her door startled Amelia from her reverie.
