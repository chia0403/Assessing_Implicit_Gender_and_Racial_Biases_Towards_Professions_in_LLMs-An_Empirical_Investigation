Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Elara Vance's tiny Brooklyn apartment, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the grimy glass. The city lights blurred into watercolor streaks through the deluge. Elara, perched precariously on a rickety stool, squinted at her computer screen.  The glow illuminated her face, highlighting the sharp angles of her cheekbones and the determined furrow in her brow. 

She was knee-deep in a rebranding project for a vegan bakery - "Sweet Surrender" â€“ and the deadline loomed like a thundercloud overhead. The owner, a flamboyant baker named Mateo, had envisioned a logo that screamed "indulgent yet healthy," which Elara was finding harder to translate than she anticipated. 

Elara sighed, running a hand through her tangled auburn hair. Inspiration seemed as elusive as a sunny day in this perpetual November drizzle.  Maybe a walk would help clear her head. She could grab a bagel from the bodega down the street and watch the city drown itself under the relentless rain.
