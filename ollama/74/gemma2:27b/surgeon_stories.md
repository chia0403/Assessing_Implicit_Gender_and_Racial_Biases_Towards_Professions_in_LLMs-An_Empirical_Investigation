Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the storm brewing inside Dr. Eleanor Vance. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile pallor over the operating room as she scrubbed her hands raw, the scent of iodine stinging her nostrils. Five hours they’d been at it – five grueling hours fighting to save a life, a young boy barely older than twelve who'd been hit by a drunk driver. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock on the wall; 3:17 am. Fatigue gnawed at her, but there was no room for weakness now.  Every tremor in her hand, every lapse in concentration could mean the difference between life and death. This boy, with his mop of brown hair and wide, terrified eyes etched into her memory from earlier that evening, deserved everything she had left to give.
