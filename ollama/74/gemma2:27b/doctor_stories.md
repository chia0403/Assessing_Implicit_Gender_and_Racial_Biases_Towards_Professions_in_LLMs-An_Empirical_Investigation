The relentless November wind howled outside, rattling the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's tiny office. Rain lashed against the frosted glass, blurring the already muted streetlights into hazy orbs. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of antiseptic and old books. Eleanor sat hunched over her desk, a pile of patient charts threatening to engulf her like an autumnal avalanche. She rubbed her weary eyes, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across her face. Her auburn hair, usually neatly tucked into a braid, had come undone, strands escaping like rebellious wisps. 

She was alone tonight, as usual.  The small clinic in the heart of Port Haven, Maine, was quiet after hours. A lone gull cried mournfully overhead, its lament echoing Eleanor's own sense of isolation. Despite her dedication to her patients and the community she served, a gnawing loneliness persisted, a constant ache that refused to be soothed by even the most rewarding days.
