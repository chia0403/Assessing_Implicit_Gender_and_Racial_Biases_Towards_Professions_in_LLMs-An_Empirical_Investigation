The air conditioning unit hummed incessantly in Bartholomew “Bart” Quince’s glass-walled office, struggling to keep pace with the July heat radiating off the concrete jungle outside. Manhattan sprawled below, a dizzying mosaic of yellow cabs and steel giants glinting under the unforgiving sun. Bart, tie loosened and sleeves rolled up, stared out at the cityscape, his reflection superimposed on the glass – a gaunt face framed by dark hair perpetually in need of a trim, eyes bloodshot from a string of late nights analyzing market trends. The Nasdaq was down 2%, and Bart’s stomach churned with the familiar cocktail of anxiety and adrenaline. He wasn't just playing with numbers anymore; people's livelihoods hung in the balance. This quarter had to be good, for his sake and the sake of his clients.  A sharp ping echoed from his computer – a notification alert. Bart swiveled back to his screen, bracing himself for whatever news awaited him.
