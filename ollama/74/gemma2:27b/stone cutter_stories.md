The air hung thick with dust motes dancing in the slanting afternoon sunbeams that pierced through the grimy windows of Elias Thorne's workshop. The rhythmic clink of chisel against granite echoed off the rough-hewn stone walls, punctuated by the occasional rasp of sandstone grinding against steel. Elias himself, his face etched with lines as deep as the grooves he carved into the stone, paused for a moment, wiping sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. He surveyed his work â€“ a delicate cherub's head, destined to adorn the mausoleum of a wealthy merchant.

Elias wasn't one for grand pronouncements or flowery descriptions. He let his craft speak for him, each precise stroke of his chisel revealing the beauty hidden within the raw stone. Yet today, even as he admired the cherub's emerging features, a nagging unease gnawed at him. Something felt amiss in the air, an unseen tension tightening like a drawn bowstring. Perhaps it was just the oppressive heat, Elias thought, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous was about to unfold.

Outside, the clamor of the city seemed muffled, as if held captive by some invisible force. The cobblestone streets below his workshop window, usually teeming with merchants and artisans, lay eerily quiet. Even the gulls circling overhead seemed to have fallen silent, their cries replaced by an unnerving stillness.
