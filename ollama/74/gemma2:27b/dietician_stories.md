Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive", blurring the vibrant street art mural that usually adorned the storefront. Inside, Amelia Rosethorne sighed, her gaze drifting from the deserted waiting area to the overflowing inbox on her laptop.

She believed in finding balance and joy in eating, helping her clients discover a sustainable and healthy relationship with their bodies. But lately, the spark had dimmed. A recent break-up had left her questioning everything, including her passion for nutrition.

Suddenly, the bell above the door jingled, breaking the silence. Amelia looked up, startled. A young woman, drenched to the bone and clutching a tattered shopping bag, stood hesitantly in the doorway.
