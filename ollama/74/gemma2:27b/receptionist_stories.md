The insistent chirping of Penelope Plumtree's phone tore her from a half-dreamed fantasy involving a talking parrot and a bottomless plate of scones. She sighed, straightening her floral blouse and smoothing down the unruly curls escaping her bun before answering with a practiced chirpiness.

"Good morning, Prestige Properties! This is Penelope speaking. How may I direct your call?"

The plush armchair in the corner, normally occupied by Mr. Hawthorne, the portly office manager, was empty today. He'd been mysteriously absent for two days now, leaving Penelope alone in the echoing silence of the grand lobby. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows, illuminating the polished marble floor and casting intricate patterns on the Persian rug. A faint scent of lilies lingered in the air, a reminder of Mrs. Hawthorne's weekly floral deliveries.

Penelope tapped her manicured nails impatiently on the mahogany desk. The insistent chirping returned, this time accompanied by the unmistakable whine of an impatient client. She braced herself for another round of demanding inquiries about leaky roofs and troublesome tenants.  But something was different today - a strange hum vibrated through the air, like a tuning fork striking a resonant note deep within her bones.

She glanced nervously at the antique grandfather clock in the corner, its hands frozen at 10:37 am. A chill ran down her spine. The phone stopped chirping, replaced by an eerie silence that amplified the hum. Penelope felt a prickle of unease, a sense of foreboding settling over her like a thick fog.

Today wasn't going to be just another ordinary day at Prestige Properties.
