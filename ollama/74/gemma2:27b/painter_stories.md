The salty tang of the sea air battled with the acrid scent of linseed oil in Elara Blackwood's tiny studio, perched precariously on the cliff face overlooking the turbulent North Atlantic.  Elara herself, with paint-splattered overalls and hair escaping its braid like unruly vines, stood back from her canvas, squinting through the dappled afternoon light filtering through the grimy windowpane. Her current subject - a brooding seascape, all churning grey waves and bruised sky - felt incomplete. It lacked something, a spark of life she couldn't quite capture. 

Frustrated, she scrubbed a hand over her face, leaving streaks of turquoise and cobalt blue across her cheekbones. The wind howled outside, mirroring the tempest brewing in her soul.
