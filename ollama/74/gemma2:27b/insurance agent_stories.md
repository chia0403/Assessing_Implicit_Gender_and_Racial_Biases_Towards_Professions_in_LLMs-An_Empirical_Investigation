Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's office, blurring the already hazy view of downtown Millersville. The ancient oak tree outside, usually stoic and strong, bent precariously in the wind, its leaves surrendering to the tempest in a flurry of brown and gold. Teddy sighed, his gaze drifting from the storm-tossed landscape to the stack of insurance claims piled high on his desk. He was drowning in paperwork - homeowners' policies after last month's hailstorm, car accident reports that smelled vaguely of gasoline and despair, even an unusual claim for a stolen toupee (which Teddy still couldn't believe was a legitimate concern). 

The phone buzzed, momentarily shattering the oppressive silence. Teddy picked it up with a tired grunt, bracing himself for another distraught customer or a suspicious claim adjuster. "Bartholomew Insurance," he mumbled, his voice rough from too much coffee and not enough sleep.
