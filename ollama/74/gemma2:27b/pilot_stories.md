The rusty scent of aviation fuel and hot asphalt hung heavy in the air, mingling with the salty tang carried on the wind whipping off the turquoise expanse of the Pacific Ocean. Amelia "Ace" Blackwood squinted at the bruised sky, streaks of orange and violet bleeding into each other as the sun dipped towards the horizon. Her calloused fingers drummed impatiently against the worn leather of her flight jacket, a nervous habit she'd developed since her first solo flight years ago. 

The battered Cessna 172 sat before her, bathed in the dying light, its single engine humming a low, steady drone.  This wasn't just any flight. This was the culmination of months of planning, scavenging for parts, and late-night repairs under flickering fluorescent lights in her ramshackle hangar. Tonight, Amelia was heading to Isla Perdida, a mythical island shrouded in legend and rumored to hold untold riches.
