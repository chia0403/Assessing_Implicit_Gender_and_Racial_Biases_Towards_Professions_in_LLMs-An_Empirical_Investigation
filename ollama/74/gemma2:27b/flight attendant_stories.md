The stale air of the Boeing 737 hummed with a dull ache, mirroring Eleanor Ainsworth's own mounting anxiety. Outside, storm clouds raged, turning the day into an ominous twilight despite it being only three in the afternoon. Eleanor, her blonde hair pulled back tight in a neat bun, adjusted her navy blue scarf, smoothing out a wrinkle that mirrored the furrow in her brow. 

This wasn’t just any flight; it was the last leg of her month-long assignment covering routes across South America, and she longed for the familiarity of her tiny Brooklyn apartment. The turbulence had been growing steadily worse over the past hour, causing nervous whispers to ripple through the cabin. Eleanor forced a smile as she passed by a frazzled mother struggling to soothe her crying baby, reminding herself that this was just another day at the office – albeit one with significantly more air pockets.

She reached the galley and glanced at the clock: 3:17 PM. The storm, according to the captain’s last announcement, was expected to subside within the hour.  But Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. The way the plane shuddered, the unnatural stillness in the air before each violent jolt – it all felt… off. 

Just then, a piercing shriek tore through the cabin, followed by a deafening CRACK. Eleanor gripped the galley counter as the entire plane lurched violently sideways.  Panic surged through her veins. This wasn't normal turbulence.
