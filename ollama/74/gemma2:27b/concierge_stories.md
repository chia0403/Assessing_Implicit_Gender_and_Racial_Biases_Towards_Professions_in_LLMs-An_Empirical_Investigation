Rain lashed against the arched windows of The Grand Blackwood Hotel, blurring the glittering lights of the London skyline beyond. Inside, a fire crackled merrily in the marble hearth, casting dancing shadows across the opulent lobby. Eloise Cavendish-Hartley, Head Concierge of The Grand Blackwood, adjusted her crisp white collar with a sigh. Another dreary evening. 

She perched on the edge of her mahogany desk, her fingers drumming lightly against its polished surface. Eloise was known for her unflappable demeanor and impeccable service. Guests often remarked on her uncanny ability to anticipate their needs before they even voiced them. But tonight, even she felt a twinge of restlessness. Perhaps it was the insistent rhythm of the rain, or the hushed whispers of the few late-arriving guests that seemed to echo through the cavernous space. Whatever the reason, Eloise couldn't shake the feeling that something unusual was about to unfold.
