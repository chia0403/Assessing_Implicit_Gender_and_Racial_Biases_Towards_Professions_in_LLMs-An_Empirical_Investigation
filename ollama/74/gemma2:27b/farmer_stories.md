The rooster's crow, usually a welcome sound, grated on Elara Blackwood's nerves this morning.  It wasn't just the usual early hour; a bone-deep weariness had settled into her, heavy as the dew clinging to the barley stalks outside her window.  Sunlight was already slanting across the worn wooden floor of her farmhouse kitchen, painting stripes across the cracked linoleum and illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  

Elara pushed herself out of bed, joints protesting with pops and creaks. She needed a good harvest this year, that much was clear. The last two seasons had been lean, leaving the Blackwood farm on the precipice of ruin. Her father's gruff warnings about "living off the land, not borrowing from it" echoed in her ears.  He'd always said farming wasn't for the faint of heart, and lately, Elara was starting to understand why.

Today, she had a decision to make: continue struggling with the meager yield from her own fields or risk everything on a gamble. A whisper traveled through the nearby village - rumors of a new strain of barley seed, one rumored to be resistant to blight and yield twice the usual amount. It was expensive, a risky investment for someone like Elara who had barely enough to feed herself and her aging dog, Jasper. But with every creak of her bones and groan of her back, the desperation grew. Could she afford not to gamble?
