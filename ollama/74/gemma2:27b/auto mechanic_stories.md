The midday sun beat down on Jasper "Jazz" Delaney's grease-stained hands as he wrestled with the carburetor of a vintage Mustang. Sweat trickled down his temple, mixing with the grime already embedded in his skin. The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of motor oil, gasoline, and something vaguely metallic that Jazz couldn't quite place. He squinted through the haze, catching a glimpse of his reflection in the chrome bumper - a young man, barely out of his twenties, with unruly brown hair sticking out from under a worn baseball cap.

Jazz's shop, "Delaney's Garage," sat tucked away on a quiet side street in the heart of Willow Creek, a small town nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering pines. The building itself was a relic, its faded red paint peeling like sunburn and the windows clouded with years of grime. Inside, the floor was littered with tools, spare parts, and engine blocks piled high, creating a labyrinthine maze only Jazz could navigate.  The rhythmic clang of his wrench against metal mingled with the distant chirping of crickets and the occasional rumble of a passing truck, creating a soundtrack uniquely Willow Creek.

Today, however, there was an unfamiliar tension in the air. A sleek black car, out of place amidst the clunkers and rust buckets that usually graced Delaney's Garage, sat parked outside. Its chrome gleamed menacingly in the sun, its tinted windows obscuring the occupants within. Jazz couldn't shake the feeling that this wasn't just another engine tune-up. Something bigger was brewing, and it smelled a lot like trouble.
