The relentless August sun beat down on Willow Creek, turning the quaint town square into a shimmering mirage. Cicadas droned their incessant symphony, punctuated by the occasional clatter from Old Man Higgins' antique shop across the street. Eleanor "Ellie" Davenport wiped the sweat from her brow, adjusting her designer sunglasses and surveying the property before her: a rambling Victorian with peeling paint and overgrown ivy, looking more like a forgotten fairytale than a desirable home.  

Ellie sighed. This wasn't exactly the glamorous life she'd envisioned when she first got her real estate license. She'd dreamt of selling luxurious condos in bustling cities, not charming fixer-uppers in sleepy towns where everyone knew everyone else's business. But Willow Creek was her hometown, and after a failed stint chasing dreams in Chicago, she'd returned to the familiar comfort of her childhood home.  

Today, however, the charm of Willow Creek felt decidedly lost. The house seemed to leer at her, whispering tales of forgotten memories and hidden secrets.  As Ellie stepped onto the creaking porch, a sudden gust of wind rustled the leaves in the ancient oak tree beside the house, sending a shiver down her spine.
