The humid Savannah air clung to Elara Mae Cartwright's skin like a second shirt as she wrestled with Mrs. DeLuca's bouffant. Beads of sweat gathered on Elara's brow, threatening to drip onto the carefully sculpted masterpiece taking shape atop the octogenarian's head.  

"Just a tad more volume here, darlin'," Mrs. DeLuca chirped from beneath the mountain of rollers and pins. "Gotta make sure it reaches heaven." 

Elara Mae stifled a giggle. Mrs. DeLuca had been saying that for years, ever since her husband passed. He'd been a preacher, you see, and Elara suspected Mrs. DeLuca believed her hair needed to be worthy of his heavenly congregation.


The setting: Elara Mae's tiny beauty salon, "Southern Charm", nestled on a quiet street in the heart of Savannah, Georgia. The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine, honeysuckle, and Elara's signature blend of lavender and rosemary essential oils. Sunlight streamed through the lace curtains, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Outside, the sounds of cicadas chirping mingled with the distant rumble of a trolley car.
