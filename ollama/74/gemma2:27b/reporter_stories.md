Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Grind, blurring the neon glow of the all-night diner across the street.  The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke and stale coffee, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of Beatrice "Bea" Holloway's fingers against her ancient typewriter. 

Bea squinted at the faded newsprint spread before her, a crumpled article about a string of unusual robberies plaguing the city's antique shops. The thieves weren't after gold or jewels, but seemingly mundane objects: a chipped porcelain doll, a tarnished silver teapot, an old compass with a broken needle. 

The story smelled fishy, and Bea, with her nose for uncovering hidden truths sharper than any rusty blade, was determined to get to the bottom of it.  Her editor had scoffed at her insistence, dismissing it as "a bunch of old junk being stolen by bored teenagers." But Bea knew better. There was something about the meticulous nature of the thefts, the specific objects chosen, that whispered of a story far deeper than petty crime.
