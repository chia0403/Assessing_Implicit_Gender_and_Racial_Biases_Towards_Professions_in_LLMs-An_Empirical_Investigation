Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Urgent Care Clinic, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign into a smear of color. Inside, the waiting room hummed with a low-pitched anxiety. coughs punctuated the rustling of magazines and the occasional sharp cry from a child. Penelope "Penny" Albright, PA-C, sighed, rubbing her temples as she reviewed the next patient's chart. A sprained ankle, likely. Another casualty of the treacherous November ice.

The clinic, nestled in the heart of rural Harmony Creek, wasn't exactly glamorous. The linoleum floor was perpetually scuffed, and the paint peeled in places, revealing the faded plaster beneath. But Penny considered it her sanctuary. Here, amidst the sniffles and scrapes, she found purpose. In a world that often felt chaotic and overwhelming, patching up broken bodies and soothing frayed nerves offered a sense of order, of tangible impact.
