Eloise paused, tilting her head to study Mrs. Henderson's reflection in the chipped, gilded mirror. "You know," she said with a playful wink, "that new beau of yours wouldn't mind a touch of auburn to highlight those eyes."

Mrs. Henderson blushed furiously, clutching her purse tighter. "Eloise!" she exclaimed, "Don't be starting rumors! He's just a gentleman caller, nothing more."
