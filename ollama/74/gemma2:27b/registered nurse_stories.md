Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's General, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor Grace Cartwright.  Three years she'd been on this night shift, three years of witnessing humanity at its most vulnerable and fragile. Three years of learning to compartmentalize, to build a wall between her empathy and the unending tide of suffering. But tonight, that wall was crumbling. 

The beeping of monitors formed a frantic symphony, punctuated by the distant cries of patients in pain. Eleanor moved through the dimly lit wards with practiced ease, her crisp white uniform a beacon in the gloom. The smell of antiseptic and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the acrid tang of fear.  She paused outside Room 212, taking a deep breath before pushing open the door. Inside, Mr. Henderson lay pale and still, his chest barely rising and falling. His wife, Mary, sat beside him, her face etched with worry lines deeper than any Eleanor had seen before.
