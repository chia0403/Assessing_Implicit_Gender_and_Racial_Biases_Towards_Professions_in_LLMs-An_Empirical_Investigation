The air in the drafty office smelled faintly of ozone and burnt coffee, a peculiar combination that always clung to Alistair Finch's threadbare cardigan. He hunched over his drafting table, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across the intricate network of lines he was meticulously drawing. Outside, the rumble of the elevated train echoed through the grimy windows, a constant reminder of the bustling city that lay beyond the dusty confines of Finch & Sons Architectural Drafting. 

Alistair's calloused fingers danced across the vellum paper, his trusty T-square and protractor extensions of his will. He was working on a commission for Mr. Davenport, a flamboyant restaurateur who wanted a grand Art Deco masterpiece built in the heart of Times Square. Alistair, with his quiet demeanor and methodical approach, seemed an unlikely match for such a flamboyant client, but he possessed an uncanny ability to translate visionary dreams into precise blueprints.

Today, however, Alistair's focus was fractured. A persistent tightness gripped his chest, a feeling that had been growing stronger over the past few days. He attributed it to exhaustion â€“ long hours hunched over drawings, fueled by lukewarm coffee and stale bread. But deep down, he knew something else was amiss. A nagging sense of unease gnawed at him, whispering of change on the horizon.
