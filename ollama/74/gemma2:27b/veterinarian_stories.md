Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, drumming a chaotic rhythm that mirrored Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's own churning stomach. The power flickered ominously, casting long, grotesque shadows across the surgery table where a whimpering ginger tabby lay swaddled in a towel.

Amelia had been expecting this storm for days - the locals always called it "The Howler" - and she'd prepped accordingly. Candles flickered on every surface, illuminating shelves stacked with jars of poultices and bottles filled with brightly colored liquids. The air hung heavy with the familiar scent of antiseptic and animal musk, a comforting aroma that usually soothed her anxieties. Tonight, however, it did little to quell the knot of dread twisting in her gut.

This wasn't just any storm. This was "The Howler" - the legendary tempest that brought more than just wind and rain. Legends whispered of strange occurrences during its fury; creatures emerging from the shadows, howling with a voice unlike anything earthly. Amelia scoffed at such tales, dismissing them as superstitious nonsense. Yet, as the wind shrieked like a tormented soul and the tabby thrashed in fear, she couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease crawl up her spine.
