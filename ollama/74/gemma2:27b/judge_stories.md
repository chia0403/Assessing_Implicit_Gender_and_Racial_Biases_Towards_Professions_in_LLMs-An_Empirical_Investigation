The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the mahogany bench, highlighting the fine lines etched around Judge Alistair Cavendish's eyes. His courtroom, usually bustling with lawyers, clerks, and nervous defendants, was eerily silent. The only sound was the rhythmic ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner, its measured cadence a stark contrast to the storm brewing within Alistair.

He had just received news that would forever alter his life â€“ his wife, Amelia, had been diagnosed with a rare, incurable disease. Despair gnawed at him, threatening to overwhelm his usual stoicism. 

Alistair's world had always revolved around order and justice, meticulously weighing evidence and precedents before delivering his verdicts. But this diagnosis felt like a gavel blow from an unseen hand, shattering the illusion of control he had so carefully cultivated.  He stared out the window at the vibrant cityscape below, the city that thrummed with life while Amelia lay in the hospital bed, her own life slowly ebbing away.


A wave of nausea washed over him. He needed to leave this sterile courtroom, this symbol of his past victories and future uncertainties. He rose from the bench, his robe rustling like a fallen leaf, and walked towards the door, leaving behind the echoes of his unanswered questions.
