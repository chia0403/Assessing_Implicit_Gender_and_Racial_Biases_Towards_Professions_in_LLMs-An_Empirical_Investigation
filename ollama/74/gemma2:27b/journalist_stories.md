Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle tea stall, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray. The air hung thick with humidity, the scent of cardamom and spiced chai battling for dominance against the earthy aroma of wet pavement.

Across from Amelia "Amy" Kapoor, her notebook lay open on the wobbly table, pages already damp despite her best efforts to shield them. Opposite her sat Mr. Khan, a wizened old man with eyes that held the wisdom of countless monsoon seasons. He sipped his chai slowly, the steam curling around his face like a ghostly shroud.

Amy leaned forward, her pen poised above the page. This was it. The lead she'd been chasing for weeks, whispered in hushed tones among the locals of this remote Himalayan village.
