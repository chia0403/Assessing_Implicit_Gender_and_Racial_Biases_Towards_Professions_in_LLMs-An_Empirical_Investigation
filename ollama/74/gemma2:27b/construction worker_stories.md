The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck, baking the sweat into his skin. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, mocking the skeletal frame of the skyscraper rising from the Arizona desert. Eli wiped his brow with a calloused hand, squinting at the blueprint spread out on the makeshift table – a battered plywood sheet propped against a half-finished concrete column. 

This wasn't just any construction project; this was the Zephyr Tower, a monument to human ambition set to pierce the clouds and redefine Phoenix's skyline. Eli, with his years of experience and steady hand, felt a quiet pride in being part of something so grand.


But today, the grandeur felt distant. A nagging unease gnawed at Eli. It started subtly – the wrong bolt size delivered, an unexplained power outage, whispered rumors about faulty steel beams.  Eli dismissed them initially as the usual hiccups of a massive undertaking. But the incidents escalated, becoming bolder, more unsettling. 

Today's discovery was the final straw: a cryptic message scrawled in red paint on one of the newly-installed floor plates – "Zephyr sleeps, but the wind remembers."

Eli stared at the words, his heart pounding against his ribs like a trapped bird. Something wasn't right. This wasn't just bad luck. There was something sinister lurking beneath the steel and concrete, whispering in the desert wind.
