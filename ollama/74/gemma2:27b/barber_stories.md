The bell above the door jingled merrily as Elias Hawthorne III stepped out onto the bustling street, the scent of bay rum and pipe tobacco clinging to his starched apron like a second skin. It was a crisp autumn morning in Bellhaven, Massachusetts, the air tinged with the smoky smell of burning leaves and the distant honk of a steamer pulling into the harbor. The shop, "Hawthorne's Hair Haven," stood proudly at the corner of Elm and Main, its green awning striped like a barber pole, a beacon to the weary souls seeking a trim and a chat.

Elias surveyed his domain with a critical eye. The window display, featuring mannequins sporting dapper cuts and meticulously groomed beards, needed dusting. He mentally added it to his growing list of tasks for the day.
