The air in Evelyn Cavendish's cramped office was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the relentless Chicago wind howled like a banshee, battering against the ancient windows of the building. Evelyn, perched precariously on her wobbly chair, stared at the spreadsheet before her, a labyrinth of numbers that refused to make sense.  The deadline for filing Mr. Henderson's taxes loomed large, and she was drowning in a sea of receipts, invoices, and cryptic scribbles. Her normally meticulous mind felt fuzzy, bogged down by the sheer volume of financial chaos she had inherited from her predecessor, a man rumored to have vanished with several clients' savings.

Evelyn sighed, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear. This wasn't the life she'd envisioned when she'd graduated top of her class at Northwestern. She dreamed of sleek skyscrapers and high-profile clients, not this dilapidated office above a questionable Thai takeout joint, surrounded by dusty ledgers and the faint scent of fish sauce.  But Evelyn was nothing if not determined. She knew she had to crack Mr. Henderson's case, not only for his sake but also to prove she belonged in this cutthroat world of numbers and audits. The question was, could she do it before her own sanity frayed at the edges?
