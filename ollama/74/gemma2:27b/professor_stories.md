Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of Professor Eleanor Winthrop's study, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the ancient panes. The fire in the hearth sputtered, casting flickering shadows across the overflowing bookshelves that lined the walls like watchful sentinels. A chill seeped into the room despite the flames, mirroring the unease settling deep within Eleanor's gut.

She stared at the telegram clutched in her hand, its crisp edges softened by nervous fingers.  The message was brief, terse even: "Urgent matter. Return to Blackwood Manor immediately. -G." 

Blackwood Manor. The ancestral home of her late husband, a place steeped in whispers and shadowed secrets. A place Eleanor had vowed never to return to. But the telegram, signed simply with the initial of her estranged brother-in-law, Gregory, held an undeniable urgency.  A chill snaked down her spine, colder than the autumn rain outside. Something was terribly wrong.
