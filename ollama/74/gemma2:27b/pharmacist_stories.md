Rain lashed against the windowpanes of 'Apothecary Lane', blurring the neon sign's glow into a sickly green smear. Inside, Elara Blackwood meticulously counted out lavender capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration. The scent of chamomile and rosehip tea hung heavy in the air, struggling to mask the underlying musk of disinfectant that permeated everything in the small pharmacy.

It was past midnight, a Tuesday even more dreary than usual. Most folks in Oakhaven were tucked away snugly in their beds, dreaming of warmer days. Not Elara. She was alone, save for the ticking clock on the wall and the occasional mournful croak of a frog outside. A storm always brought out the night owls, the ones with insomnia or sudden ailments that couldn't wait until morning.

Tonight, however, Elara felt an unsettling stillness. Something prickled at the back of her neck, a premonition she couldn't quite place. The bell above the door chimed, jolting her from her thoughts.
