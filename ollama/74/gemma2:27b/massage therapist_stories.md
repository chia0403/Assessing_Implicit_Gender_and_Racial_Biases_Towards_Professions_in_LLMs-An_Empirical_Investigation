Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Anya Sharma's tiny treatment room, mimicking the relentless drumming in her chest. The power flickered, plunging the space into momentary darkness before sputtering back to life. A gust of wind howled, sending a shiver down Anya's spine. It was nights like these that made Anya question her decision to open "Serenity Now" – her massage therapy practice – above the creaky old bookstore in a forgotten corner of Seahaven.

Seahaven, a once-bustling seaside town, had fallen into a melancholic slumber since the fishing industry collapsed. The smell of salt still hung heavy in the air, but now it mingled with the scent of decay and damp wood. Anya, who'd inherited the bookstore from her eccentric grandmother, had hoped to breathe new life into the place, to create a haven for weary souls seeking solace.

But tonight, the only sound was the rain and the relentless tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner, reminding Anya of time slipping away. She glanced at the empty massage table draped in lavender sheets – no appointments today, yet again.  


Anya sighed, wondering if perhaps she should've followed her brother to the city, where opportunity beckoned like a lighthouse beam in the fog. But Seahaven was home, even with its fading glory and haunting whispers of the past. Anya just needed to find a way to make it work.
