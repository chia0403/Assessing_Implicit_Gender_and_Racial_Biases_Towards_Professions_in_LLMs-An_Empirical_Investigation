The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and woodsmoke. A low rumble of thunder echoed through the valley, threatening to unleash the afternoon storm that had been brewing all morning. Amelia Beatrice "Bee" Hawthorne adjusted her worn apron, the fabric stained with years of culinary triumphs and mishaps. She glanced out the window of her small mountainside restaurant, "The Rusty Kettle," towards the craggy peaks that guarded their secluded village. Tourists were scarce these days, deterred by the unpredictable weather, but Bee wasn't fazed.

She hummed a cheerful tune as she stirred a pot of fragrant vegetable stew, her movements practiced and sure. The rhythmic chopping of vegetables and the clatter of pots and pans provided a comforting soundtrack to the quiet anticipation before the storm. Today was different though. Today, a stranger was expected.
