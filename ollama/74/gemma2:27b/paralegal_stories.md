Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. Eleanor Vance sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The fluorescent lights of the cramped office hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the stacks of files piled precariously on her desk.

While she dreamed of arguing cases in court, for now, her role was behind the scenes, sifting through mountains of paperwork and piecing together legal strategies. But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation ran down her spine as she uncovered a discrepancy in the witness testimony â€“ a seemingly insignificant detail that could potentially unravel the entire case.
