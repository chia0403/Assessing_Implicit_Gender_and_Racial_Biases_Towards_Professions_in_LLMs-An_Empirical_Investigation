The July sun hammered down on Asheville, North Carolina, turning the asphalt streets to shimmering mirages and baking the slate shingles under Elias "Eli" Blackwood's calloused hands. Eli balanced precariously on the steep gable of a Victorian mansion, sweat stinging his eyes as he wrestled a stubborn bundle of cedar shakes into place. The scent of pine tar mingled with the honeysuckle fragrance wafting up from the manicured gardens below, creating a uniquely Asheville olfactory experience â€“ one that usually calmed Eli's nerves but today felt oppressive under the relentless heat.

His foreman, burly Hank "Hammer" Henderson, bellowed instructions from the ground, his voice gravelly as chipped concrete. "Eli, you seein' those gaps? Tighten 'em up! We ain't buildin' no birdhouses here!" Eli grimaced. Hammer wasn't known for his patience, especially on scorching days like this. 


He needed to finish this roof and get down before the heatstroke he was already feeling turned into something more serious.
