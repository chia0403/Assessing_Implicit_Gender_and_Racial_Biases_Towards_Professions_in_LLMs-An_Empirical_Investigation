Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the already indistinct lights of the city into shimmering halos. Eleanor Vance gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles bone-white against the worn leather. The siren wailed, a mournful counterpoint to the drumming rain, as she weaved through the late-night traffic.  

A frantic call had crackled over the radio moments ago - a multi-vehicle collision on the freeway, multiple casualties reported. Eleanor's gut clenched. Every fiber of her being was geared towards action, towards alleviating suffering. Five years in emergency medical care hadn't dulled the visceral reaction she felt whenever faced with potential tragedy.

Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine, a sense that this call wasn't just another routine accident. The rain seemed to intensify, mirroring the storm brewing within her.  As they approached the flashing red and blue lights marking the scene ahead, Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for whatever awaited them on the rain-slicked asphalt.
