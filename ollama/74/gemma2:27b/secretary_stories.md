Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Sterling & Sons office building, blurring the already dreary cityscape into an impressionistic smudge of grey and yellow. Inside, Amelia Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear as she meticulously filed invoices. The rhythmic clatter of the ancient typewriter echoed through the cavernous, mostly empty office, a lonely counterpoint to the insistent drumming of the rain.  

Amelia sighed, her gaze drifting from the neat stacks of paper to the overflowing in-tray on her desk. Mr. Sterling, ever demanding and prone to sudden pronouncements, was due back any minute from his "important meeting" with a potential investor. And as usual, it would be Amelia left scrambling to decipher his scrawled notes and prepare for whatever whirlwind he'd decide to unleash upon the office.

It wasn't that she disliked her job. In fact, Amelia found a strange satisfaction in bringing order to the chaos that perpetually swirled around Mr. Sterling. But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of her neck warned her of an impending shift â€“ a subtle change in the air pressure that hinted at something momentous about to unfold.
