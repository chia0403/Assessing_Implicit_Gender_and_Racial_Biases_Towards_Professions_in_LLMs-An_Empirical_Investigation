The flickering neon sign outside buzzed insistently, casting streaks of sickly yellow across Amelia Rose Cartwright's tired face. "Benny's Burgers: Home of the Juicy Lucy," it declared in bold, dripping letters. The irony wasn't lost on Amelia. Benny's was anything but homey, its vinyl booths cracked and sticky with decades of spilled soda, the air thick with the scent of frying grease and desperation.

Amelia sighed, smoothing down her starched apron for the tenth time that evening. It was Tuesday night, the slowest night of the week, which meant she was stuck filling ketchup bottles and scrubbing grimy tables while the other servers gossiped about their weekend exploits. She envied them, their carefree laughter a sharp contrast to the dull ache in her own chest. 

Tonight, Amelia yearned for something more than just refilling coffee cups and placating grumpy customers. Tonight, she dreamt of escape â€“ a place where the air didn't smell like burnt grease and the only flickering lights were those of fireflies dancing in a summer meadow.
