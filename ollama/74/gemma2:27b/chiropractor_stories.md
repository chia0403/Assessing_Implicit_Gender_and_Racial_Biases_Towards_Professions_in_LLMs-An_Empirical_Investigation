Rain lashed against the bay window of Dr. Eleanor Vance's chiropractic clinic, blurring the lights of the bustling downtown Seattle street below. The rhythmic drumming of droplets mixed with the low thrum of classical music emanating from the hidden speaker system Eleanor had installed years ago – a calming counterpoint to the relentless city clamor.

Eleanor sighed, leaning back in her ergonomic chair and stretching her arms above her head. Another dreary Seattle afternoon was winding down, mirroring her own dwindling energy.  The usual influx of patients hadn't materialized today; perhaps they were all hunkered down, enjoying the excuse for a cozy evening indoors.


She glanced at the clock – 4:30 pm. With no appointments on the horizon, Eleanor considered calling it a day early. As she reached for her phone, a sharp rapping on the clinic door startled her. She rose and smoothed down her crisp white coat before padding over to greet the unexpected visitor.
