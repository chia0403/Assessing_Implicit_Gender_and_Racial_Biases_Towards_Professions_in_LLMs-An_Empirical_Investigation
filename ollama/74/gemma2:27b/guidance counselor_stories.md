The stale scent of old textbooks and forgotten dreams hung heavy in Amelia Rosalind Hayes' office. Outside her window, autumn had painted the maples bordering Elmwood High fiery shades of crimson and gold, but inside, the mood was decidedly grey. Stacks of college applications teetered precariously on Amelia's desk, each one a silent plea for guidance, a desperate hope pinned to acceptance letters and scholarships. 

Amelia, with her auburn hair perpetually escaping its bun and eyes that held the weary wisdom of countless student dilemmas, sighed. It was always busiest this time of year. Senioritis had swept through Elmwood like a rogue virus, leaving behind a trail of unfinished assignments and existential dread. Amelia felt the weight of their futures on her shoulders, a responsibility she carried with both pride and trepidation. Today, however, something felt different. A tremor of unease ran beneath the surface of her usual autumnal anxiety.

A sharp knock startled her from her thoughts. "Come in," she called, straightening the crumpled brochure for "Top Ten Universities You've Never Heard Of" on her desk. 


The door swung open, revealing a student Amelia hadn't seen before. He stood awkwardly in the doorway, his lanky frame swallowed by an oversized hoodie that hid most of his features.  Only his eyes, wide and uncertain, were visible above the collar. He looked like a lost fawn caught in headlights.  

"Amelia Rosalind Hayes?" he asked hesitantly, his voice barely a whisper.
