Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elara Thorne's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, the concrete jungle of Chicago sprawled under a shroud of grey, its towering buildings seeming to lean inwards, suffocated by the downpour.

Elara, a probation officer with steel-grey eyes and a tightly wound bun atop her head, stared at the file in front of her.  "Marcus Davenport," it read in bold, black letters. Another young man swallowed whole by the city's unforgiving underbelly. This time, though, something felt different. A tremor of unease ran through her. Marcus wasn't just another statistic; his file was riddled with inconsistencies, whispered rumours of a past far darker than petty theft.


As the rain hammered relentlessly against the glass, Elara picked up the phone, her gut screaming at her to tread carefully. This case, she knew, promised to be anything but ordinary.
