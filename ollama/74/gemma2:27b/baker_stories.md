The air hung heavy with the scent of burnt sugar and cardamom, clinging to Amelia Beatrice Cartwright like a second skin. She pushed open the window of her bakery, "Sweet Surrender," hoping to coax out some of the lingering heat from the ovens, but the humid July air outside offered little relief. Sunlight, thick and syrupy, streamed through the dusty panes, illuminating swirls of flour on the counter and the chipped enamel of her mixing bowls. Amelia sighed, her breath fogging the cool glass momentarily.

The morning rush was done, leaving behind a battlefield of crumbs and sticky spoons. But Amelia wasn't complaining. She relished the quiet lull before the afternoon wave of tourists descended upon her quaint bakery nestled in the heart of historic Savannah, Georgia.  Her creations – from flaky croissants to decadent pecan pies – were renowned throughout the city, drawing in hungry crowds eager for a taste of Amelia's magic.
