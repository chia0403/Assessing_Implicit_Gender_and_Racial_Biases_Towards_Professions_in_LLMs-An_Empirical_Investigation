Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Alistair Finch's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his skull. The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale coffee, a familiar cocktail in this dimly lit corner of downtown Chicago. A single flickering neon sign outside cast an ethereal green glow across the worn Persian rug, its once vibrant colors now faded to a muted sepia.

Alistair Finch, a man whose face bore the map of countless sleepless nights and hard-won battles, stared at the photograph clutched in his hand. It was a young woman, barely out of her teens, with eyes that held both innocence and a haunting sadness. Her name was Lily Rose Hawthorne, and she'd walked into Alistair's life just yesterday, begging him to find her missing brother.
