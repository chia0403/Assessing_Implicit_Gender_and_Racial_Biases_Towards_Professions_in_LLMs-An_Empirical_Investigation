The sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah "Si" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a rusted bolt holding a mangled guardrail together. The scent of asphalt and diesel hung thick in the air, punctuated by the insistent drone of cicadas from the scrubland bordering Highway 15. Miles stretched before him in both directions, shimmering under the relentless July sun. Si squinted towards the horizon where the heat seemed to warp the distant mountains into hazy phantoms.

He wasn't built for this kind of work anymore. His joints ached with every movement, and his once-powerful hands trembled slightly. But it was honest work, keeping the artery of commerce flowing, even if it meant sacrificing a little comfort. Si knew these roads like the back of his hand. He'd been patching them up for over thirty years, ever since he returned from Vietnam, a shell of the man he used to be. The highway, in its own way, had become his solace.

A rumble broke through the monotony â€“ a semi-truck barreling down the asphalt, its horn blaring a warning as it approached Si's makeshift work zone. He sighed, wiped the sweat from his eyes, and reluctantly set down his wrench. Another day on the endless ribbon of Highway 15.
