The wind whipped across the mesa, carrying the scent of sagebrush and dust, stinging Elara Blackwood's eyes. She squinted at the horizon, where the sky met the rolling hills in a hazy wash of blue and ochre. Her weathered hands gripped the reins of her palomino mare, Buttercup, as they crested a rise. Below them, stretched the Blackwood Ranch, generations of hard work carved into the rugged landscape. 

Elara scanned the pastures for any sign of trouble â€“ a stray calf, a breach in the fence, anything out of place.  Ranching was in her blood, a legacy passed down from her great-grandfather who'd staked his claim on this unforgiving land back in the 1800s. But lately, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the dust kicked up by Buttercup's hooves. It wasn't just the drought that had been plaguing them for months, drying up the creek and turning the grass brittle. There was a sense of unease, a feeling that something unseen was watching, waiting.
