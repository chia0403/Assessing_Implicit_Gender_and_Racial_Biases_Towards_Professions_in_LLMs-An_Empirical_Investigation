The rusted gate groaned like an arthritic knee as Elias Thorne pushed it open. A shiver ran down his spine despite the late summer sun beating down on the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor. The air hung heavy with the scent of roses and something else, something older, mustier - the smell of secrets buried deep in the earth.

Elias had been groundskeeper at Blackwood for ten years now, ever since he'd fled the city and its clamor for the quiet solitude of this sprawling estate. He knew every inch of the gardens like the back of his hand, from the labyrinthine maze of boxwoods to the hidden grotto where a crumbling fountain whispered forgotten stories. Yet today, something felt different.

A sense of unease prickled at him as he surveyed the rose garden. The blooms, usually bursting with vibrant color, seemed muted, their petals tinged with an unsettling grey. Even the bees, normally buzzing with frenetic energy, were strangely still, hovering silently amongst the drooping flowers.  

As Elias reached for his shears, a glint of something metallic caught his eye. Half-buried beneath a sprawling rose bush lay a small, silver locket, its surface etched with intricate symbols he couldn't decipher. A chill swept through him as he carefully brushed away the dirt, revealing a tiny inscription on the inside: "Forever Blackwood."
