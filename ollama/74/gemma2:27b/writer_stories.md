Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the drumming in Elara Blackwood's chest. Her fingers hovered over the yellowed keys of her ancient typewriter, each click echoing in the cavernous space like a hesitant heartbeat. Outside, the wind howled a mournful song through the gnarled branches of the oak tree that clawed at the roof. It was the perfect setting for a gothic novel, Elara thought wryly, but inspiration felt as distant as the stars obscured by the storm clouds.

She'd retreated to her grandmother's crumbling Victorian manor hoping to find solace and spark her imagination.  But the dusty furniture, cobwebbed portraits staring down from the walls, and the incessant creaking of the house seemed to amplify her writer's block rather than alleviate it. Elara longed for a story to grab hold of her, to pull her out of this suffocating stillness. Little did she know, the manor itself held secrets far more captivating than any she could conjure.
