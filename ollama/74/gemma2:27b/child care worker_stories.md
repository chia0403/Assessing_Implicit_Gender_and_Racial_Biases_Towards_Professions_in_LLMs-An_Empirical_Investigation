The air hung thick with the sweet scent of crayons and hand sanitizer, a familiar perfume in Amelia Cartwright's world.  She surveyed the chaotic scene before her: giggling toddlers building precarious towers out of wooden blocks, pre-schoolers engaged in a spirited debate over which superhero reigned supreme, and a lone baby contentedly gurgling in his bouncer. 

Amelia loved this symphony of childhood, each high-pitched shriek and clumsy stumble a testament to the boundless energy and endless curiosity that fueled her days. Yet, today, a tremor of unease ran through her usually calm demeanor.  The new family, the Millers, had arrived just that morning, their faces etched with a weariness that belied their forced smiles. Their son, Ethan, a quiet five-year-old with eyes as blue as forget-me-nots, clung to his mother's leg like a limpet, refusing to engage with anyone. Something about the boyâ€™s silence, and the haunted look in his mother's eyes, unsettled Amelia.

The daycare door chimed, announcing the arrival of Mrs. Miller. Amelia steeled herself for another round of forced pleasantries, but as Mrs. Miller approached, a flash of panic crossed her face. Her voice trembled as she whispered to Amelia, "Ethan forgot his favorite blanket...Mr. Snuggles. He won't sleep without it."

Amelia's heart sank. She had a feeling this was just the beginning of a very unusual day.
