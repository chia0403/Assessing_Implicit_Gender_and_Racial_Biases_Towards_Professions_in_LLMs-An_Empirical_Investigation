The brass bell in Percival Bartholomew "Percy" Finch's hand chimed like a mournful church bell as he wrestled with the monstrous steamer trunk. It was blocking the entrance to the Grand Majestic Hotel, a behemoth of gilded plaster and stained glass looming over the bustling London street. Percy grunted, his wiry frame straining against the weight of the luggage.

Percy wiped the sweat from his brow, hoping he wouldnâ€™t fumble this important delivery. He knew one wrong step could cost him his job, not to mention the chance encounter with someone as intriguing as Lady Thorne.
