The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Hawthorne's neck as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn rosebush. Its thorny branches snagged at his worn work gloves, refusing to budge from its spot along the manicured edge of Mrs. Davenportâ€™s prize-winning garden. Eli wiped the sweat from his brow, squinting through the glare reflecting off the pristine white stones that bordered the flower bed.

This wasn't the kind of work Eli had envisioned for himself when he graduated with a degree in horticulture. He dreamed of designing sprawling botanical gardens, not coaxing overgrown shrubs into submission for fussy retirees. Still, there was a certain satisfaction in bringing order to chaos, even if it meant battling prickly plants under the relentless summer sun.

Today's project, however, promised something more intriguing than just routine trimming and weeding. Mrs. Davenport had mentioned whispers of a hidden garden on her property, a forgotten space overgrown with ancient trees and rumored to hold secrets long buried beneath the earth. Eli, always drawn to mystery and the allure of the unknown, was eager to uncover what lay hidden within the tangled undergrowth.
