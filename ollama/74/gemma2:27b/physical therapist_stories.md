The rain lashed against the windows of "Kinetic Care," mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Rose Hawthorne. The aroma of lavender and eucalyptus oil usually soothed her patients, but today it felt cloying.  A stack of unpaid invoices sat accusingly on her desk, a stark reminder of the precarious state of her business. Just three months ago, she'd celebrated opening her own physical therapy practice after years of toiling in crowded hospitals. Now, with barely enough clients to keep the lights on, Amelia wondered if sheâ€™d made a colossal mistake. 

The bell above the door chimed, pulling her from her bleak thoughts. A young woman, shoulders hunched and face etched with pain, stepped into the dimly lit waiting room. This was Clara Evans, Amelia's first appointment of the day - a dancer whose dream career had been abruptly cut short by a devastating knee injury. 

Amelia rose to meet her, plastering on her best professional smile.  Maybe, she thought, helping Clara reclaim her strength would be just what she needed to rediscover hers.
