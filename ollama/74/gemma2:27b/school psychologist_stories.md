Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Rosethorn’s office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The cluttered desk, usually a haven of organized chaos filled with colorful stress balls, assessment charts, and half-finished research papers, now felt suffocating. Across from her sat thirteen-year-old Daniel Hayes, his face buried in his hands, shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

Amelia had been working at Willow Creek Middle School for five years, navigating the tangled web of adolescent anxieties and academic pressures. But Daniel's case felt different. His grief was raw, a gaping wound that Amelia feared wouldn't heal.  He'd lost his mother just a month ago in a car accident, and while his classmates were returning to normalcy after the initial shock, Daniel seemed frozen in time, trapped in a whirlpool of pain.

The air in the small office felt heavy with unspoken words. Amelia reached for a worn teddy bear tucked away on a shelf – a relic from her own childhood – hoping its comforting presence might soothe Daniel’s fractured spirit. Outside, the storm raged on, blurring the world beyond the windowpane. Inside, Amelia braced herself for the long and arduous journey of helping Daniel find his way back to the light.
