The scent of jasmine incense hung heavy in the air, battling with the sharp tang of freshly-sanded oak. Amelia "Amy" Blackwood stepped back from her latest project – a 19th century Victorian townhouse undergoing a delicate facelift. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunbeams slicing through the floor-to-ceiling windows, illuminating the swirling floral pattern she'd just painted on the dining room ceiling. Amy ran a hand through her auburn braid, surveying her work with a critical eye. The intricate design, inspired by William Morris, was meant to evoke a sense of history and grandeur, a counterpoint to the sleek, modern furniture she planned to introduce.

But something felt off. A disquiet lingered in the air, a prickling sensation on the back of Amy's neck. It wasn't the usual apprehension that came with tight deadlines and demanding clients. This was something else entirely – an unsettling chill that seemed to emanate from the very walls themselves.
