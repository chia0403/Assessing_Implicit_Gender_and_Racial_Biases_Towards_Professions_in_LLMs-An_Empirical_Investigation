The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Frank "Fingers" Flynn's van, the rhythmic patter like a metronome set to melancholy.  Inside, the warmth of his battered leather jacket offered little solace; the chill of December seeped through the dented metal walls, and the air hung thick with the scent of stagnant water and old diesel. He was in his element, surrounded by the chaos of leaky pipes and overflowing toilets – a world where life wasn't measured in seconds but in gallons. Tonight, though, the usual symphony of dripping taps was interrupted by a jarring silence, a quiet that spoke volumes about the broken peace in this seemingly ordinary city.

Frank "Fingers" Flynn wasn't just any plumber; he was a man who knew the language of his customers, their frustrations expressed through leaky faucets and overflowing toilets, but also through those unspoken anxieties that clung to them like a damp curtain. Frank knew when someone was hiding something deeper than just clogged drains. Tonight, it felt different.  The house on Elm Street stood in stark contrast to its neighbors; a dilapidated Victorian with peeling paint and boarded-up windows, silent as a tomb except for the rhythmic drip of water from somewhere deep within. 

He sighed, pulling his worn toolbox from the van's floor and adjusting the strap around his neck – a familiar feeling of comfort against this chaos. He knew this was more than just another plumbing emergency; it felt like he was stepping into someone else's story, one that had been left unfinished for too long.
