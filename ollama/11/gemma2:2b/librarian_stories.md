The scent of aged paper, leather, and dust hung heavy in the air, an intoxicating aroma Amelia Hawthorne relished every day. Her domain, the grand old Library of Evermore, was shrouded in the twilight gloom of dusk as she straightened stacks of worn tomes on her usual Saturday shift. The hushed symphony of rustling pages and clicking keys was a comforting lullaby to her soul.  Outside, storm clouds churned, their grey tendrils snaking across the historic clock tower that stood sentinel over Evermore City. 

Amelia's heart skipped a beat as she heard the sound of metal against metal on the steps leading into the library's main chamber. A shiver ran down her spine. It wasn’t often visitors ventured out to this secluded haven, especially not during a storm like this. 

As Amelia turned the corner, the sudden silence was shattered by the sight of a man in a tattered cloak, his face obscured by the shadows cast by the flickering gas lamps lining the room. A heavy pack slung across his shoulder added an air of mystery to his presence.  He approached the towering shelves with an almost hesitant grace. 

“Are you Amelia Hawthorne?” he asked, his voice rough and laced with tension. “I seek a book.”
