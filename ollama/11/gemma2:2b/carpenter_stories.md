## The Wind's Song

The salt-laced wind whipped around Elias Thorne, swirling dust motes in the afternoon sun that slanted through the eaves of his workshop.  His calloused hands tightened around the worn handle of his saw, its familiar weight grounding him amidst the symphony of creaks and groans that echoed from the ancient houseboat he called home. Built in 1852, The Sea Serpent was a sprawling vessel, anchored at the edge of the bustling port city of Newhaven. Elias’s grandfather had built it, his father had worked its timbers until his final, peaceful fall into the ocean waves. Now, it held Elias and his dreams – dreams of carving out a life more than just a carpenter's son, dreams that were as restless and unpredictable as the sea itself.

He was working on a commission: a grand armoire for Mrs. Hawthorne, a wealthy widow with tastes as extravagant as her diamonds. Elias’s heart felt heavy. He yearned to create something truly unique, something that wouldn’t just be built but *lived* in. Something that would sing the same wind song his grandfather and father sang, something that spoke not of wood alone but of stories, of dreams, and of a life lived on the water's edge.  His hammer fell with a measured thud, its sound resonating through the silent workshop.
