Rain lashed against the window of Amelia's tiny apartment, blurring the neon glow of the city lights that spilled onto her street. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and unfulfilled promises.  Amelia, with her worn-down Converse and rumpled t-shirt, hunched over her desk â€“ a battlefield of half-eaten snacks and tangled wires. Her fingers hovered above the keyboard, ready to launch another iteration of 'Project Phoenix,' her attempt at revolutionizing online dating with its unique algorithm.

**Setting:** Amelia's cramped apartment in the bustling but gritty city of New Eden. 
*The building is a converted warehouse with exposed brick walls and an industrial-chic vibe. The only sounds are the relentless drizzle, the whirring of servers behind her back, and the low hum of the internet connecting everyone in the city.*

**Main character:** Amelia "Em" Sinclair, a brilliant yet lonely computer programmer.  
*Her ambition for Project Phoenix is tempered by her fear of success and connection. She yearns for love but struggles to navigate both the virtual world and her own heart.*
