The air hung thick with the scent of warm yeast and sugared citrus, a familiar yet comforting aroma that clung to Amelia's apron like a second skin. Sunlight slanted through the shop window, painting the worn countertop where she kneaded dough into warm streaks of gold.  Her bakery, "Flour & Flame," had been her haven for years in the heart of Maplewood, a quaint town nestled within the rolling hills of rural Vermont.

Amelia was known throughout the community for her delicate pastries - delicate raspberry tarts with almond fronds, buttery brioche loaves with cinnamon swirls, and her signature apple pies that seemed to sing with the taste of autumn itself.  But today, something felt different. A tension pulsed beneath the familiar rhythm of baking, a sense of anticipation Amelia couldn't quite place. 

The day was as crisp and clear as a winter sky, and yet, the wind brought whispers from beyond Maplewood - whispers that carried with them an echo of change.

**Notes for you to continue:**
* You can explore the "tension" within Amelia and why she feels it. Is there a customer issue? A personal dilemma? A change in her community?
*  Think about what kind of "whispers" are being heard and how they might connect to the bakery's usual routine or to Amelia herself.
