Eleanor, whose age felt closer to the twilight years of Mrs. Peabody's beloved teddy bear collection than her actual life expectancy, sighed contentedly as she surveyed her charges. They were a motley crew: the boisterous Billy who insisted on building his tower upside down, Lily, with her ever-present raincloud of worry in her big blue eyes, and Oliver, whose perpetual grin seemed to melt the world's troubles away. But it was the quiet boy named Daniel, tucked away in the corner drawing a strange, intricate creature that captured her heart.  Her smile, like a burst of sunshine on a rainy day, widened as she approached him.
