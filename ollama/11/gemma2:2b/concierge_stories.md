## The Gilded Cage

**Setting:**  The opulent penthouse suite of the Grand Zenith Hotel in Paris.  It overlooks the Eiffel Tower, bathed in soft, golden evening light that paints streaks across its intricate wrought iron structure. 

**Character:** **Isabelle Moreau**, a concierge with silver hair and eyes the color of storm clouds, is known for her piercing gaze and unwavering resolve, but also for her hidden kindness. The Grand Zenith was her life, its inhabitants and their dramas woven into her own personal tapestry.  Each guest brought its own story, each one a thread to be carefully handled and unraveled.

**Opening:** "Another one bites the dust, Madame?" Isabelle's voice echoed through the suite, breaking the quiet hum of the evening Parisian air. A plume of smoke curled from a delicately-smoked cigar beside an empty champagne flute.  “He seemed to think he was invisible, hiding behind his usual melancholic fog.” 

Isabelle leaned against the plush velvet curtain, watching as the young woman in a shimmering emerald dress sat slumped on the chaise lounge, her face buried in her hands. She hadn't been expecting another tragedy this early in the evening, yet she saw it coming like an inevitable storm. Isabelle's gaze drifted to the window, its reflection mirroring the sadness etched upon her guest’s face. The city of love was showing off its beauty under the night sky, but a dark cloud hung over the penthouse suite. 

"He just wants to be seen, that's all," she murmured, her voice soft as velvet. "And yet, he never dares to truly live."
