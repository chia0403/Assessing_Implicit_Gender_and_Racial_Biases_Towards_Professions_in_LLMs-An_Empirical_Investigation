The humid Georgia air clung to Dr. Evelyn Hawthorne like an unwelcome second skin as she surveyed the bustling scene at Riverbend Animal Hospital.  The afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn asphalt parking lot, dappling the faces of panicked pets and their worried owners in fleeting bursts of light. The scent of disinfectant mingled with the musky aroma of damp fur - a familiar cocktail that Evelyn found both comforting and unsettling. 

Her own worries were as palpable as the heat radiating from the linoleum floor. It was only yesterday, just before closing time, that she'd received a frantic call about Winston – a large, boisterous Golden Retriever who lived with an elderly couple in a charming yet slightly dilapidated cottage on the edge of town. The call had been filled with frantic pleas for help, punctuated by a series of choked sobs and a desperate hope for recovery.  Evelyn’s heart sank as she looked at her own reflection in the stainless steel instrument tray - worry etched into the normally serene lines of her face. 

"It's not going to be easy," her assistant, Maryann, had murmured, her voice clipped with unspoken concern. "But we have to do what we can for Winston."  Evelyn nodded, the weight of a thousand impossible odds settling on her shoulders. Today, she faced more than just a case of canine colic. She faced the harsh reality that sometimes, even in a place where animals were supposed to find solace and comfort, some wounds never healed.
