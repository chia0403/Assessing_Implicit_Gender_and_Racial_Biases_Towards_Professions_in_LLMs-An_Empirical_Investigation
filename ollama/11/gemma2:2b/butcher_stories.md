The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and blood, a familiar symphony to Elias Thorne’s senses.  He ran a calloused hand across the well-worn leather of his apron, the smooth surface a stark contrast to the jagged lines of meat he'd just cleaved from a prized, aged steer. The afternoon sun, sinking towards the horizon in fiery hues of orange and red, cast long shadows on the dusty floor of his shop, “Thorne’s Tenderloin,” the sign above proclaiming it with an almost defiant cheer.  

Elias Thorne was no ordinary butcher. His hands, strong as an oak, had a delicate touch when they coaxed life from the animal's heart and made its final journey a graceful dance of slaughter. He lived for the challenge of crafting succulent roasts and sausages that brought joy to his customers – their faces lit with satisfaction at every bite. However, beneath this veneer of normalcy lurked a deep secret. A secret whispered in the silence of his lonely nights as he carved intricate figures from the discarded bones, or when the late-night moon cast long shadows across his shop’s walls: Elias Thorne wasn't just skilled in butchering; he was a master illusionist, conjuring life-like spirits and ghostly apparitions that left patrons mesmerized.
