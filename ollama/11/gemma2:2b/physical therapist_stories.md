## Story Opening

Rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already dim cityscape into an impressionistic swirl of gray and green.  The wind howled like a restless beast outside, and within the cozy space, Eleanor sat hunched over a patient file, her brow furrowed.  Her fingers tapped rhythmically on the worn leather cover as she scanned the charts, trying to decipher the tangled web of Lily's injuries. 

Lily, barely twenty years old, had been brought in after a mountain bike accident.  Eleanor was no stranger to treating accidents, but this one felt different – a raw wound, a stark reminder of the fragility of youth and the harshness of life’s unpredictable turns.  The rain outside seemed to mirror the turmoil within her – an overwhelming sense of helplessness as she knew how little she could truly offer Lily in this moment of despair. 


## Setting

Eleanor's office sits on the edge of a bustling city quarter. The building itself is a small, cozy structure with brick walls and a quaint wooden door that creaks open to reveal her warm, inviting space. Inside, the air is filled with the aroma of lavender candles and the faint scent of pine from the books lining the shelves.  There's an old-fashioned leather armchair tucked near a fireplace, perfect for Lily's first sessions.
