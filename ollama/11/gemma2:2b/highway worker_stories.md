The endless ribbon of asphalt stretched before Elara Thorne like an undulating river of grey and beige.  She stood on the shoulder of I-80, her worn work boots sinking into the gravel as she adjusted the heavy chain wrench in her hand.  The late afternoon sun was fading fast, casting long shadows that danced amongst the steel beams of construction fences that bordered the highway like protective guardians. Elara shifted her weight from one foot to the other, a familiar ache throbbing in her knee. Another day, another pile of broken asphalt and concrete. 

It wasn't glamorous work - far from it, really. But for Elara, whoâ€™d been working on this stretch of highway for the past five years, it was steady. It was routine. It was a quiet rebellion against the roaring anonymity of the city that lay just beyond the horizon.  She lived in a small cabin nestled on the edge of town, where silence wasn't just peace but a necessity to maintain her mental well-being. Elara needed the solitude to rebuild after the storm - and the roadwork had become more than just work; it was a tangible attempt at shaping her own existence, even if it meant sacrificing some semblance of normalcy.
