Her breath plumed white in the chill air conditioner, clinging to her tired eyes behind the glass-paneled register. It was 10:45 pm on a Wednesday night, and most of the world outside seemed to be asleep. Just a few stray cats slinked through alleys down the street, their yellow eyes flickering like warning flares in the darkness.  The only other soul in sight was Mr. Henderson, an old man with a perpetual frown etched onto his face who lingered for hours after closing, meticulously cleaning out the cash drawer before finally leaving. 

Amy's job at the Corner Market was more than just a paycheck; it was a constant, almost suffocating, routine.  Each day felt identical to the last: restocking shelves, ringing up customers, and dreaming of anything other than the monotony that wrapped around her like an ill-fitting apron. She dreamt of escaping the confines of this small town, of seeing the world beyond its dusty streets and faded paint.  But today, as she scanned the price tag on a package of beef jerky, a sense of possibility stirred within her.
