The Arizona sun beat down on the endless stretch of yellow sand, turning it into a shimmering mirage that danced with the heat waves rising from the cracked earth.  Dust motes swirled in the air, catching the light like miniature stars as they settled back onto the worn asphalt of the construction site. It was here, amidst this unforgiving landscape, where the steel heart of the world beat - at least according to Ethan "The Bull" Bellwether's point of view. 

Ethan, a mountain of a man with calloused hands and a beard that looked like a storm cloud had blown through his life, surveyed his domain from the worn cab of his monstrous Caterpillar bulldozer. He was as familiar with the roar of its engine as he was with his own breath, years of hauling dirt under his belt and a stubborn streak thicker than the desert itself.
