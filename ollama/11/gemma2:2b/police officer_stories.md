The rain hammered against Detective Elias Thorne's trench coat as he stood before the grimy diner, its neon sign flickering in the downpour like a wounded heart. The air was thick with the aroma of stale coffee and yesterday's burnt doughnuts - a scent that usually did little to entice him, but tonight it felt strangely comforting. He adjusted his fedora, shielding his eyes from the flash of rain, and pulled out a crumpled photograph from his pocket. On the cracked surface, a young woman's face stared back at him, her vibrant green eyes now clouded with an unsettling stillness.

**Setting:** A dingy diner called "The Salty Dog" perched on the edge of the city, tucked away in a forgotten corner of San Francisco. It was known for its cheap coffee and even cheaper clientele, often harboring those who had fallen through the cracks between society's fringes. 


**Character Name:** Detective Elias Thorne
