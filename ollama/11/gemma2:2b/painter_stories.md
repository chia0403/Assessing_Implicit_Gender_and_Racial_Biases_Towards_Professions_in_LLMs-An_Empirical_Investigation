The air hung thick and still over the San Francisco Bay, mirroring the heavy silence in Elias Thorne's small studio.  Moonlight filtered through the gaps in the window frames, bathing the canvas upon which he labored in an ethereal blue glow.  Elias, known to friends as "Eli" for his quiet demeanor and even quieter art, was a painter of profound beauty but with a melancholic soul. His subjects were often found in his dreams: faded Parisian cafes, the swirling mist on the ocean, and lone figures against the backdrop of twilight skies. 

His current work, however, was different. It wasn't the ethereal dream-world he usually painted; it was a stark, almost violent clash of colors.  Crimson streaks bleeding into charcoal shadows on an otherwise pristine white canvas - a piece that felt as chaotic as his own emotions. He hadn't touched his brush in days, and the studio air crackled with frustration, each brushstroke an assault against the blank canvas.
