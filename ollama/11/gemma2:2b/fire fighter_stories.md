The salt spray stung Elias Thorne's face as he leaned over the railing of the ferry, the wind whipping strands of his auburn hair around his eyes. It was supposed to be a beautiful night, the stars blazing through a clear sky above the harbor. Instead, it felt like the whole world was holding its breath, waiting for something dark to burst out. The docks were deserted except for Elias and his partner, Captain Ben Campbell, a gruff but loyal man with a booming laugh and a face weathered by years at sea. 

"Something's not right, Ben," Elias muttered, staring out at the choppy water. He'd been a fireman on the coast of Maine since he was old enough to hold a hose, and this kind of stillness had always been ominous.  He could feel it in his bones, a sense of impending storm that seemed too real to ignore. 

They were stationed aboard the ferry 'Sea Breeze', their usual rhythm replaced with an unfamiliar tension. A few hours ago, a distress call from a fishing vessel off the coast had jolted them awake, and now they waited on the verge of something monstrous, a shadow rising from the abyssal depths.  The air was thick with anticipation, and a chill settled over Elias as he felt his instincts screaming: something was coming.
