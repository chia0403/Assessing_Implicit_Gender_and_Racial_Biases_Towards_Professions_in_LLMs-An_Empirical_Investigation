The morning mist clung to Hawthorne Manor like a jealous lover's embrace.  A chill wind rustled through the ancient oaks that ringed the estate, their leaves already turning from vibrant green to shades of auburn and burnt umber. Even the sky refused to be cheerful; bruised purples and dusky oranges painted the horizon, promising another gloomy day.  

Thomas Hawthorne wasn't one for melancholy. He preferred the earthiness of a wet morning over the suffocating air of the manor house itself. His boots crunched on the dew-kissed ground as he walked the perimeter of his domain - an expanse of overgrown gardens bordered by thick, thorny bushes. His hands, calloused and strong from years spent battling weeds and pruning roses, were used to the harsh beauty of nature's own hand in shaping this forgotten landscape.  

His full name, Thomas Hawthorne, was a whisper in the wind amongst the rustling leaves. No one else cared for the land except him; he saw life blooming within each weed and fern, whispered secrets only the soil could understand.  Even in the gloomy light of this pre-dawn hour, he felt it – an unspoken kinship with the earth.

The manor itself stood like a giant silent sentinel, its stone facade weathered by time and storm.  Its grand windows, once sparkling eyes looking out on the world, were now cloudy, reflecting nothing but shadows.  It was as if even Hawthorne Manor itself was mourning, lost in a fog of neglect and despair.  
 
But Thomas Hawthorne wasn't here to lament. He had his own battles to fight – against the encroaching weeds that threatened to choke the life out of the roses, against the creeping silence of an abandoned soul, and most importantly, against the very nature of time itself.  He was a witness to the passage of years; each season was a story he knew by heart, yet still yearned for something new – something more than just tending to the earth.
