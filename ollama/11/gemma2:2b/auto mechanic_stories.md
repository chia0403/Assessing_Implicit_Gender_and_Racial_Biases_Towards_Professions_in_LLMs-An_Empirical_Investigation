Rain lashed against the windows of “Rusty Wrench Auto Repair,” each drop exploding on the warped metal siding like tiny fireworks. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of oil and burnt rubber – an aroma that was as familiar to  Marcus "Mac" Peterson as his own reflection in the grease-streaked shop mirror.  

Mac sighed, wiping a smear of black tar off his forehead with a grimy rag. He wasn't sure if he liked the rain or hated it. It always seemed to amplify the clattering symphony of the shop: the whirring of the overhead lift, the rhythmic thump of hammers against steel, and the occasional bellow of frustration from a customer complaining about their busted-down Ford.  Mac had inherited the business from his father, and the legacy felt as heavy in the air as the oily residue coating his tools.

His gaze landed on the engine bay of a beat-up '67 Mustang. The owner's son was due back any minute to pick up his dad's prized car after months of repairs – work Mac had been putting off, much like he did with his own bills.  He was waiting for inspiration. 

The shop's worn bulletin board displayed a faded picture: a smiling, dirt-stained woman holding her newborn. "To the best mechanic in town!" it declared, her handwriting as clear and bright as the day she left it there. But Mac knew it hadn’t been about him; it had been about his father. And that was another story altogether.
