## Story Opening & Setting 

**Main Character:** Amelia “Melodie” Blackwood

**Setting:** The dilapidated back room of "The Dusty Lantern," an old tavern on the outskirts of Riverton, a sleepy town with a reputation for fading dreams and lingering secrets.  

Rain lashed against the boarded-up windows, mimicking the erratic rhythm of Melodie's heartbeat as she surveyed the room. Dust motes danced in the pale beam of moonlight cutting through the grime-coated air. Empty chairs stood like silent sentinels. A lone piano sat hunched in a corner, its ivory keys coated with an unknown layer of grease and neglect. 

The only sounds were the mournful howl of the wind and the steady drumming of her fingers on the worn wood of the doorjamb. She took a deep breath, trying to quell the anxiety that gnawed at her insides. Tonight was the night. The audition for "Voice of the Heartland," a singing competition she’d entered with both trepidation and fervent hope, a chance for escape from the life she had always known – a life of performing for paying crowds in seedy bars like The Dusty Lantern.
