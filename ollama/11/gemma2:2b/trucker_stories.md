## The Ballad of Jebediah "Jeb" Cartwright

**Setting:**  A sweltering July afternoon in the heart of Arizona's dusty desert. The sun beats down on I-10, turning the asphalt into shimmering veins of heat radiating out across miles of barren earth. Wind whips through the scrub brush alongside the highway, carrying with it a subtle scent of sage and something else, something sweeter and more volatile - the promise of rain. 

**Main Character:** Jebediah "Jeb" Cartwright.  A man as weathered as the land he traverses.  He's spent years behind the wheel, his calloused hands tracing the worn leather of his steering wheel.  His faded trucker cap sits slightly askew, shadowing the eyes that have seen too much and held back from too many tears. 

**Opening Scene:**  The engine whines in a symphony of frustration, each gear shift a weary growl as Jeb fights to keep his rig moving on the treacherous stretch of highway. He's been stuck for hours, battling against a stubborn flat tire that refuses to yield. The air hangs heavy, thick with tension and the simmering heat of the desert sun. Sweat slicks his brow, a reflection of the relentless pressure he carries in every mile of this road. 

Suddenly, the radio crackles to life. A low rumble vibrates through the cabin, followed by a voice as rough as the tires themselves. "Jeb, this is Jack.  We've got some bad news."   Jeb's hands tighten around the wheel. His gaze shifts to the cracked asphalt ahead, his heart sinking with every passing moment. The road stretches on, seemingly forever, towards an uncertain horizon. 


**This is just the beginning.** What fate awaits Jeb in this desolate landscape?  How will he navigate the treacherous currents of his own past and the unexpected storm brewing on this sun-baked highway?
