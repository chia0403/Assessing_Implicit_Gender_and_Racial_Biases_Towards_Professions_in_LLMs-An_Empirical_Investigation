Rain hammered against the stained glass windows of Blackwood Manor, each drop a tiny explosion echoing through the opulent yet strangely desolate interior.  Inside, Amelia Thornhill knelt in the dusty drawing-room, her thin fingers expertly navigating the labyrinthine folds of the Persian rug. It was late, the moon hanging like a swollen pearl in a bruise-colored sky, and the air hung heavy with the weight of unspoken secrets.  The manor's inhabitants had long fled - gone, vanished into the ether of time and circumstance – leaving Amelia to tend to the echoing silence, and the mounting pile of linens in her worn basket. 

Amelia Thornhill. Just another name in the tapestry of the Blackwood legacy, except she was anything but ordinary. She wasn’t just a housekeeper;  she was a guardian, an observer. For years, she’d silently witnessed the rise and fall of the Blackwood family, felt the slow pulse of their lives beat through the floorboards, breathed in the scent of fading memories and untold stories. Her world was a tapestry woven from whispers, shadows, and secrets that clung to the ancient stones of the manor like cobwebs. 

Tonight, though, there was a change in the air. A new story was beginning to unfold, one she couldn't help but feel drawn into.  Her hand paused on a worn velvet cushion, as if pulled by an unseen force. It whispered of hidden truths and untold adventures. And Amelia, for once, felt more than just the weight of her duties.  She felt a responsibility to uncover the mysteries that lay buried beneath Blackwood Manor's gilded facade.
