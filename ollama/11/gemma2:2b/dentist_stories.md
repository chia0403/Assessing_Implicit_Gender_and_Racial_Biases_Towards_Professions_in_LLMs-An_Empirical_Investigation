## Story Opening:

The whirring of the ultrasonic scaler was the soundtrack to Dr. Evelyn Thorne's Tuesday morning.  She adjusted her glasses over the corner of her left eye – a habit she couldn't seem to shake - and glanced at the reflection in the metal cup as another patient’s nervous smile flitted into view. The familiar sting of sterile cotton swabs against her fingers, the faint metallic scent of bleach lingering in the air, all these were constants in Evelyn’s routine.  It was a Tuesday like any other, she mused. 

The office, a cozy haven nestled away on Elm Street, exuded a comforting calmness that Evelyn couldn't help but find a balm to her soul. A hundred miles from the city’s clamor and a lifetime away from the stress of public life, her small practice in the sleepy town of Willow Creek was where she found sanctuary. Or so she thought. 

But something felt off today. The stillness in the waiting room seemed thicker than usual, and there was an unsettling tension that tightened Evelyn's chest like a vise as she prepared for another routine checkup.  


## Setting:

**Additional Details:**

* **Character's background:** Evelyn is in her late forties and has built a successful career as a dentist in Willow Creek after graduating from the prestigious University of California, Berkeley.
