The air hung thick with lavender and eucalyptus, a fragrant cocoon that did little to mask the simmering anxieties in Amelia's small studio. Her fingers traced over the worn grooves of her client’s antique leather massage table, an old friend she shared countless hours of silent therapy with over the years. It had been one year since her husband, a renowned architect known for his sleek, modern structures, left her after their twenty-year marriage crumbled under the weight of unspoken frustrations and buried secrets. 

Amelia’s heart hammered in her chest as she looked at her client, Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne, a woman whose age was almost tangible through the wrinkles etching her face and the silver strands that peeked through her auburn bob.  Mrs. Hawthorne had been Amelia's first customer after the divorce, and despite Amelia's initial fear of venturing back into the world after a year of solitude, she’d found solace in the rhythmic pressure and soothing touch of her hands. But this evening was different. The air crackled with unspoken tension, a storm brewing beneath the surface of Mrs. Hawthorne's serene facade.  

The setting was Amelia’s haven - a cozy apartment nestled in a quaint street lined with pastel-colored Victorian homes and fragrant jasmine vines that trailed down from the windowsills. Yet, even amidst the serenity of her sanctuary, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. This wasn't simply another session; it held the potential for unraveling a hidden knot in Mrs. Hawthorne's life, one that threatened to spill over and engulf Amelia’s own fragile peace.
