##  Setting: The Smog City

Rain slicked the grimy streets of New Gotham City, each drop reflecting the neon lights of the towering skyscrapers that choked the sky. It was 2:00 AM and the air tasted of burnt exhaust and despair. Even the pigeons seemed to huddle in greater numbers than usual, their wings a symphony of flapping against the oppressive humidity.

Inside the claustrophobic confines of "The Numbers Game," an accountant's office nestled on the backstreets of Gotham, Mr. Archibald Blackwood, known as Arch by all who knew him (and by most who simply thought his name sounded imposing), tapped away at his keyboard with a rhythmic intensity only a man who lived and breathed spreadsheets could possess.  

**Archibald Blackwood**, a name whispered in awe and resentment within the city's underbelly – the former accountant of "The Kingpin", now an independent contractor, toiling in the shadows of New Gotham's ever-growing corruption. His eyes were red-rimmed, haunted by the ghosts of past tax returns and the countless deals that had never been made right.  

A sudden tremor rattled the building. Not a quake, not exactly, but a deeper shudder that seemed to emanate from within the city itself, like an animal waking from a long, restless dream. Arch paused, his fingers hovering over the keys. The rain was starting to fall harder, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. He knew – somehow – this tremor wasn't just about physical tremors in the city. Something bigger was coming.
