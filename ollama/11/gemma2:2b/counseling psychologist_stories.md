The air in Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office hung thick with lavender and chamomile, its scent attempting to drown out the gnawing tension that seemed to cling to every corner.  She sat behind her worn desk, sunlight casting long shadows across the faded floral pattern on the carpet. Outside, the city pulsed with a frenzied energy, but inside, Evelyn was alone with her thoughts, and they were a storm of tangled emotions. The door creaked open, a hesitant step entering a world she rarely invited in. 

"Evelyn?" A young woman's voice echoed hesitantly, barely audible above the hum of the air conditioning. 

It was Sarah, one of Evelyn's newest clients. A fresh-faced 20-year-old who clutched a tattered brown bag like a lifeline. It wasn't just the weight of her anxieties that she brought in â€“ it was the unadulterated desperation in her voice. The kind of desperation that made Evelyn's own heart ache, reminding her why she entered this profession in the first place. 
     
The setting: Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office in a modest but charming apartment building on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.  A haven for troubled souls seeking solace and understanding amidst the city's relentless clamor.
