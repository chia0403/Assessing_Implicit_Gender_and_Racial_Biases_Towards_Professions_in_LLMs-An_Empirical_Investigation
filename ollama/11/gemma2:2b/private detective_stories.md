Rain hammered against the grimy window of my office like a thousand tiny fists pounding in frustration. My eyes, bloodshot from all-night readings and too many cups of instant coffee, scanned the latest entry on my overflowing case file. It was just another dead end, yet another piece of evidence suggesting this city, New Orleans, had somehow grown even more sinister than usual. This was the life I chose, after all – navigating its labyrinthine alleys, chasing whispers in the shadows. 

My name is Remy Moreau, and for twenty years, I’ve been a private detective in the heart of the Big Easy, my office smelling faintly of stale cigarette smoke and cheap bourbon.  Tonight though, even my usual cynicism seemed to have drained away like the city's floodwaters after a long storm. The case file in front of me was nothing short of bizarre: a missing musician named Jean-Pierre Dubois, whose only claim to fame was being the lead guitarist for a band called "The Swamp Stompers."  He hadn’t been heard from since his last gig at The Voodoo Lounge, and now, his stage guitar, a battered Les Paul he'd nicknamed “Big Bertha”, had gone missing.

My beat was jazz – not just playing it, but understanding the soul of its every note. And for Jean-Pierre, Big Bertha was more than just an instrument; it held echoes of his life, his dreams, and all the lost love stories woven into the rhythm of his songs.  But there was a dark undercurrent in this case – one that felt like a bad dream creeping up on me. The case wasn’t about finding a musician, but something much deeper, much more sinister. 


The rain continued to beat against the window as I grabbed my trench coat and stepped out into the swirling mist.
