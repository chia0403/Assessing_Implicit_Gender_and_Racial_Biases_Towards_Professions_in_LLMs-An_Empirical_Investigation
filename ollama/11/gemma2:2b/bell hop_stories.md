The worn leather soles of Reginald “Reggie” O'Connell clicked against the polished linoleum of the Grand Aurora Hotel lobby. Every corner echoed with hushed whispers and the faint hum of unseen electric motors in the grand staircase that spiraled upwards towards the forgotten heavens. The air was thick with a blend of lavender perfume, old wood polish, and a faint, metallic tang that Reggie had come to associate with the city's hidden anxieties. 

Tonight, he was stationed at room 317, where a pair of silver-haired gentlemen in tailored suits argued about the proper amount of sugar for their morning coffee. Reggie’s eyes scanned his notepad: 'Mrs. Eleanor Thorne, room 317', and a faint image of a woman with hair like spun gold flashed across his mind. The grand lady of Aurora, they called her, and she was rumored to be the one who kept the hotel's magic flowing. At least that’s what Reggie thought, despite having never actually seen her face in all these years. 

As he waited for his next assignment, a faint melody drifted from behind the velvet curtains at the back of the lobby. It was a haunting tune, like a whispered secret carried on the wind, and Reggie's pulse quickened with an unfamiliar thrill. He knew that music held power here, in this forgotten corner of the city where dreams and nightmares danced around every flickering light.
