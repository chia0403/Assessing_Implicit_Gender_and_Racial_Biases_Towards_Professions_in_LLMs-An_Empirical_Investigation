## Story Opening:

The air hung thick with the scent of burnt garlic and simmering marinara as Elara, or "Ellie" to those who knew her well enough, navigated the chaotic symphony of dinner service at Il Fiore. The bustling Italian trattoria was known for its boisterous patrons - families celebrating birthdays, old friends reminiscing over bottles of wine, and tourists eager to taste a sliver of Naples in their own backyards. 

Ellie's station was near the front door, her domain the flow of tables, ensuring each guest was attended to with a smile that bordered on exasperation but always held warmth.  Tonight, however, the usual jovial chaos felt like it had been replaced by an undercurrent of tension – the type that clung to your heart and made every clink of silverware sound like a gunshot in the stillness of the kitchen. 

The night was not unlike other nights at Il Fiore, but tonight there was something different about the air – a silent worry hanging on each guest's lips. Even the usual boisterous laughter felt strained, replaced by forced smiles and hurried conversations.
