The air in "Shear Delight" was thick with the heady scent of lavender and pine needles, a comforting aroma that usually did little to alleviate the anxiety bubbling within Arthur Blackwood's stomach. He was a man of routine, his days a predictable symphony of clippers, scissors, and hot towel steam. Yet today, the usual quiet hum of the shop felt like a cacophony of whispers, each one a question about his silence.

Arthur had been in the business for over forty years, and for decades, his clients were drawn to his gentle touch and unwavering professionalism. Old Mrs. Peterson was a fixture, always humming along to the jazz playing softly on her vintage radio. Little Timmy Williams would come with his unruly mop of brown hair, demanding Arthur turn him into "the most dashing young man in town."  

But now... he wasn't sure what to do. The shop windows were plastered with flyers; a faded picture of a handsome man grinning behind a pair of gleaming shears. This was no ordinary cut, not even one he had done before. The flyer screamed "The Great Transformation", and Arthur’s gut twisted.  This was the face of his competitor, Mr. Thorne. 

He took a deep breath, focusing on the familiar weight of his clippers in his hand. “Just another day," he murmured, but the words felt hollow even to him. The air crackled with a strange tension; it wasn't just the scent of lavender and pine needles anymore.  Something was brewing, something that would change everything about Arthur Blackwood.
