The air inside was thick with the scent of old leather and pipe smoke, a familiar aroma that brought comfort more than any floral arrangement could.

The window overlooking the bustling city seemed to hold a thousand untold stories - whispers of deals made and broken, promises whispered in hushed tones, secrets hidden behind veils of silk and shadow. Mr. Hawthorne's office was a stage where power played out on a grand scale, yet Amelia, with her meticulous organization and quiet presence, found herself at the heart of the drama. Today, however, something felt different. The air hummed with an unfamiliar tension, the normally polished veneer showing cracks.
