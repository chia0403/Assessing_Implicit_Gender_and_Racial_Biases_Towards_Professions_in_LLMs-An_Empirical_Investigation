Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished stone as Professor Emilia Evelyn Wellesley stepped out of her office building and into the chilly Scottish night air. The University of Edinburgh's historic buildings loomed around her, their Gothic spires and turrets reaching towards the grey sky like skeletal fingers. Emilia, a renowned expert in ancient languages, had just received an unexpected visit from a mysterious stranger who claimed to have uncovered a long-lost text that would shake the foundations of her field.

As she lit a cigarette and stood on the edge of Princes Street Gardens, the sound of the raindrops mingling with the hum of the city created a symphony of sounds that Emilia felt intimately familiar with. She had spent countless hours walking these streets as a graduate student, pouring over dusty tomes in the university's libraries and exploring the hidden corners of the city.

Now, at 42, Emilia was a respected professor in her own right, known for her tireless enthusiasm and sharp intellect. Her office, tucked away in a quiet corner of the ancient castle, was a treasure trove of artifacts and antiquities that she had accumulated over the years. As she gazed out into the rain, Emilia felt a thrill of anticipation - what secrets lay hidden within the pages of this mysterious text, and how would it change her life forever?
