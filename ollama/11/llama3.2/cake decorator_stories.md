As the first light of dawn crept through the small window of her cozy bakery, Colette Ad√®le Dumont stretched her arms over her head and yawned, sending a flutter through the delicate sugar flowers she had spent hours arranging on the display case the night before. The sign above the door read "Le Jardin de Sucreries" - "The Sugar Garden" - in elegant, swirling script that seemed to match the whimsical curves of Colette's own handiwork.

Colette lived for this moment, when the world outside was still and quiet, and all that existed was the promise of a new day filled with the sweet scent of sugar, butter, and possibility. As the bakery's head cake decorator, she took pride in crafting edible masterpieces that brought joy to her customers' lives - from whimsical wedding cakes to bespoke birthday treats that seemed almost too beautiful to eat.

But as she began to prepare for another busy day, Colette couldn't shake the feeling of restlessness that had been growing inside her. A sense of discontent simmered just beneath the surface, a feeling that there was more to life than the gentle rhythms of Le Jardin de Sucreries and the predictable routine of decorating cakes for special occasions. Little did she know, this restless spark would soon ignite into a fire that would change everything.
