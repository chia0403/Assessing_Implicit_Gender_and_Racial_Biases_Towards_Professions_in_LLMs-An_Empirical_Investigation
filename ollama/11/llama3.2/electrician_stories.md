As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, Maine, Electrician's Assistant Emily Victoria Windsor rubbed the fatigue from her eyes. She had spent the long night before working on a particularly tricky wiring job at the old Bellvue Mill, and was looking forward to a quiet morning coffee at the local diner.

The diner, aptly named "Electric Dreams," was a cozy institution in Ravenswood, with vinyl booths and a counter that seemed to stretch on forever. The air inside was thick with the smell of greasy food and freshly brewed coffee, and Emily felt a sense of comfort wash over her as she slid onto a stool at the end of the counter.

Outside, the misty dawn air clung to the streets like a damp shroud, casting an eerie gloom over the deserted sidewalks. The old mill loomed in the distance, its brick facade weathered to a soft grey that seemed to blend seamlessly into the surrounding landscape. Emily felt a thrill of satisfaction as she thought about the job well done, and the sense of satisfaction that came with fixing something broken.

The diner's owner, Mabel Jenkins, seemed nervous and on edge, glancing nervously at the door as if expecting someone - or something - to walk in any moment.
