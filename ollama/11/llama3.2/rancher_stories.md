Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of the Red Rock Ranch, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and scrubby juniper trees that dotted the landscape. Jack Harrison McCormick, a rugged and weathered rancher in his mid-forties, stood at the edge of the corral, surveying the scene before him. His worn leather boots were scuffed and dusty from a day's work, and his faded denim jeans hung loose on his muscular frame.

The Red Rock Ranch had been in Jack's family for generations, and he took great pride in its history and traditions. The ranch was situated in the heart of Arizona's rugged desert country, where the rocky outcroppings and scrubby vegetation gave way to vast expanses of open range. It was a place of harsh beauty, where the elements were unforgiving and the land was as unforgiving as the people who lived here.

As Jack gazed out at the ranch, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease had been growing in him for weeks, ever since his best friend and business partner, Alex, had gone missing during a cattle drive. The authorities had given up searching, but Jack knew that Alex wouldn't just disappear without a fight.

Now, as he stood at the edge of the corral, Jack felt a shiver run down his spine. He could have sworn he saw something moving in the distance, something that didn't look like any of the animals on the ranch. It was a fleeting glimpse, but it had left him with more questions than answers.

With a sense of trepidation, Jack turned and walked back towards the ranch house, his mind racing with possibilities and worries. He knew that he had to get to the bottom of what was going on, no matter how difficult or dangerous it might be.
