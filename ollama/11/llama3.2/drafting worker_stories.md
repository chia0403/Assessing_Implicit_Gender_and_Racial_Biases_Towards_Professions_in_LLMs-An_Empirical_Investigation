Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Manchester gleamed like polished onyx as Emilia Rose Taylor stepped off the tram and onto the worn stone pavement. Her bright yellow raincoat was a splash of color against the drizzly grey sky, but her eyes were fixed on the task at hand: finding a decent cup of tea in this sodden town.

As she walked towards the cramped office building that housed her small drafting firm, Emilia's mind wandered back to the latest project on her desk. The Smithson construction company had hired her to create detailed blueprints for their new development on the city's waterfront, and she was determined to get it right.

The smell of damp earth and mildew wafted through the air as Emilia pushed open the creaky door to her office, a cramped but cozy space filled with dusty files, half-empty cups of cold tea, and the soft hum of the computer that kept her business afloat. She slipped off her raincoat and hung it on the rack by the door, revealing a faded Manchester United scarf peeking out from beneath.

It was going to be one of those days, Emilia thought, as she began to sort through the stack of papers and reports waiting for her attention. But with a fresh cup of tea in hand and the hum of the computer as her companion, she was ready to tackle whatever challenges came her way.
