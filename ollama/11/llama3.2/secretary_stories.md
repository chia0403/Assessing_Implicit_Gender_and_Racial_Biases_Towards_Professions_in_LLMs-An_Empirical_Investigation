Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the streets of downtown New Haven like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy shadow over the city's steel and glass skyscrapers. Inside the drab, beige-colored office building of Smith & Co., a small secretary named Emily Elizabeth Wellesley trudged through her afternoon coffee break, her eyes fixed on the clock ticking away on the wall.

It was 3:47 PM, and Emily was counting down the minutes until her shift ended. As she gazed out the window at the rain-soaked streets below, her mind began to wander back to the strange letter she'd received earlier that week. The envelope had arrived in a plain white package with no return address, containing only three sentences typed on a single sheet of paper: "The truth about your sister's disappearance is hidden in plain sight."

Emily's sister, Sarah, had vanished five years ago, leaving behind only a cryptic note and a deep sense of abandonment. The police had never found any leads, and Emily's family had all but given up hope of ever uncovering the truth.

But now, as she stood there sipping her lukewarm coffee, Emily felt a shiver run down her spine. Who could have sent this letter, and what did they mean by "plain sight"? And why now, five years after Sarah's disappearance?

As if sensing her unease, the phone on her desk jolted to life, shrill and insistent. Emily groaned inwardly, knowing that she was about to be pulled back into the drab, mundane world of office politics and paperwork.

"Smith & Co.," she said, trying to sound cheerful despite the growing sense of unease in her chest.

But as she lifted the receiver, a voice on the other end whispered something that made Emily's blood run cold: "You need to talk to someone about Sarah."
