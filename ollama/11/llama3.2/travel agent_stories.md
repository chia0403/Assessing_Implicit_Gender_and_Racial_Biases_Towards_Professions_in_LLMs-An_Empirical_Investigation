Here's a potential story opening:

**Setting:** The small coastal town of Tidal Cove, Maine, USA - a quaint seaside destination known for its picturesque lighthouses, bustling summer tourist season, and sleepy winter months. In the heart of Tidal Cove lies a charming travel agency called "Escape Essentials," where our protagonist spends most of her days planning dream vacations for clients.

**Main Character:** Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a warm and energetic 28-year-old travel agent with a passion for exploring new destinations and connecting people with their perfect getaways. Lexi has spent the past five years building a loyal client base in Tidal Cove, where everyone knows her name and she's always happy to offer recommendations on the best lobster rolls or hidden beach spots.

As the winter solstice approaches, Lexi finds herself feeling restless, eager to escape the monotony of the off-season and plan a trip that will take her far from the frozen tundra. Little does she know, this season will bring an unexpected challenge - one that will put her travel expertise to the test and push her to her limits.
