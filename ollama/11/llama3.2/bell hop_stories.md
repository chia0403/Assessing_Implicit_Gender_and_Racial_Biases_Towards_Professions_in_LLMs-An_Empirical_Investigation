Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The neon lights of the faded sign cast a gaudy glow over the deserted parking lot, illuminating the worn pavement and the solitary figure of Elijah "Eli" Thompson, a bellhop with a penchant for lost causes. It was a chilly autumn evening in 1955, and the rain-soaked streets of New Haven, Connecticut were eerily quiet, save for the distant hum of the city's nightlife.

Eli stood outside the crumbling facade of the Ravenswood Hotel, his worn luggage cart rattling softly as he leaned against it, eyeing the deserted street with a mixture of boredom and resignation. He had been working at the Ravenswood for what felt like an eternity – ever since the war had left him with a patch over one eye and a mysterious scar above his left eyebrow – and it was starting to feel like just another day in a long line of monotonous, soul-sucking shifts.

As he lit a cigarette, the faint scent of smoke wafted into the damp air, mingling with the musty aroma of decaying hotel rooms and stale coffee. Eli took a long drag, feeling the nicotine coursing through his veins like a bitter elixir, as he gazed out at the darkened streets, searching for any sign of life – or, more likely, any sign of trouble. For in New Haven, where the past seemed to linger on every corner, and the present was always just around the next corner, Eli knew that trouble was always just one step away.
