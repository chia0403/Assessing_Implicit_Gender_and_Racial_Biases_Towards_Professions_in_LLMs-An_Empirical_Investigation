As she stood in front of the crumbling mansion, Emily Victoria Wellesley gazed out at the overgrown gardens and faded grandeur with a mix of nostalgia and trepidation. The once-majestic estate had been abandoned for decades, its grandeur and beauty slowly being consumed by the passing of time. But it was this very same decaying grandeur that had drawn Emily to the property - as a potential client.

As an interior decorator with a passion for restoring faded elegance, Emily had spent years scouring the city's hidden gems for the perfect project. And now, at the age of 28, she had finally landed her dream job: transforming this very mansion into a breathtakingly beautiful and modern oasis.

As she looked up at the mansion's facade, Emily couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and trepidation. What secrets lay hidden within these crumbling walls? And what would it take to restore this once-majestic home to its former glory?
