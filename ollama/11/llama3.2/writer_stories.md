Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The fog rolled in off the coast of Ravenshire, shrouding the small town in a damp, gray mist that clung to the streets like a damp blanket. The year was 1888, and Emilia Fothergill, a struggling writer with a penchant for the macabre, sat hunched over her desk at the local tavern, the Red Griffin Inn.

As she pored over her latest manuscript, a Gothic romance novel about a young woman's descent into madness in a crumbling English mansion, the fire crackled and spat in the hearth, casting eerie shadows on the walls. The patrons of the inn, a rough-and-tumble bunch of sailors and laborers, looked on with suspicion as Emilia scribbled away by candlelight, her eyes fixed intently on the page.

Outside, the mist swirled and eddied, hiding secrets in its swirling depths. It was said that on certain nights, when the fog rolled in off the coast, the restless spirits of Ravenshire's past would stir, drawn to the flickering flames of the Red Griffin like moths to a candle. And Emilia, with her morbid fascinations and writer's fevered imagination, felt an inexplicable pull towards the darkness that lurked just beyond the edges of town.

Little did she know, tonight was one such night.
