Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was already beating down on the cracked asphalt as Ryder "Rye" Jackson climbed into his worn-out pickup truck, the one with the faded bumper sticker that read "I'd rather be working." Rye rubbed the grit from his eyes, taking a deep breath of the smoky air that hung over the highway like a perpetual cloud. He had been a highway worker for over a decade, and it showed – every inch of him was weathered, from the lines etched into his forehead to the scuffed toes on his work boots.

The highway stretched out before him like a snake through the desert landscape, a ribbon of asphalt that connected small towns and rural communities to the world beyond. Rye's crew had been called in for the night to fix a pothole near Old Town, where the pavement was as rough as the folks who lived there – tough, resilient, and always ready to speak their minds.

Rye started the engine and pulled out of the parking lot, joining the slow crawl of traffic that made its way up and down the highway. As he drove, the radio crackled with static, broadcasting a local news station's weather report: "High pressure system expected to bring clear skies and light winds for the next 48 hours...but don't get too comfortable – we've got another storm brewing on the horizon."

Rye snorted in the back of his throat. He'd seen storms like that before – the kind that came out of nowhere and left a mess behind. But he wasn't worried. Not yet, at least. The sun was still shining bright, casting long shadows across the desert floor...and Rye had a job to do.
