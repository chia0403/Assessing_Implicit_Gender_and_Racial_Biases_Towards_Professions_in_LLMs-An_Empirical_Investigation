The acrid smell of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of disinfectant and sticky-sweet juice boxes that perpetually permeated Sunnyside Daycare. Amelia "Amy" Harper grimaced, pushing open the door to the play kitchen just as Timmy, a four-year-old hurricane of energy, triumphantly brandished a blackened piece of bread. 

“Look, Miss Amy! I made breakfast!” he crowed, his face smeared with soot and a wide grin splitting his freckled visage. Amy sighed, resisting the urge to roll her eyes. Another day, another close call with culinary catastrophe. 

Sunnyside Daycare was housed in a rambling Victorian on Elm Street, its once-vibrant paint faded and peeling like sunburnt skin. The building held a multitude of memories – the scent of crayon scribbles on aging wallpaper, the echoing laughter of countless children during playtime, and the hushed whispers of worried parents at pick-up time. For Amy, it was more than just a job; it was a haven for rambunctious toddlers and shy preschoolers alike, a place where she could nurture young minds and create moments of joy amidst the chaos. 


Today, however, a sense of unease lingered in the air, thicker than the burnt toast smell. Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right.  Perhaps it was the absent-minded stare of Mrs. Peterson, usually a whirlwind of activity in her classroom, or the unusual silence emanating from the playroom. Whatever it was, a knot of apprehension tightened in Amy's stomach.
