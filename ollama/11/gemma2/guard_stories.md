The reek of damp wool and stale sweat clung to Sergeant Alistair Finch like a second skin.  He adjusted his rusted breastplate, the metal cool against his heated brow. Around him, the barracks buzzed with the low murmur of men sharpening swords, gossiping in hushed tones, or simply trying to ignore the insistent gnawing of hunger in their bellies. The midday sun beat down on the rough-hewn stone walls of Fort Aegis, casting long shadows that danced menacingly across the courtyard. 

Alistair sighed, his gaze falling upon a half-eaten loaf of bread lying forgotten on a dusty table. It wouldn't last him until dinner, but it was better than nothing. He wasn't starving exactly, not yet, but the recent raids by the Northern tribes had stretched their resources thin. Supplies were dwindling, morale was low, and every day felt like treading water in a storm-tossed sea.

He knew his duty, though. His father, a seasoned veteran of countless campaigns, had instilled that in him from a young age.  Alistair Finch, Sergeant of the First Company, would stand his ground, come hell or high water. He wouldn't let fear dictate his actions, nor would he betray his comrades. He was the shield between their small village and the chaos beyond the ramparts. He had to be strong. 


He finished his meager breakfast, the stale bread doing little to quell the gnawing in his stomach, and stood tall, ready for whatever the day might bring.
