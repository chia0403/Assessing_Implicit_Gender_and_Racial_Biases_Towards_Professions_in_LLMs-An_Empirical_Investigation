The air in "Lacquered & Lovely" hung thick with the scent of acetone and cherry blossom nail polish.  Eulalie Bellweather hummed along to the 80s pop playlist blaring from the vintage boombox tucked into the corner, her nimble fingers expertly shaping a set of almond nails for Ms. Henderson, a regular whose weekly appointments were as reliable as the sunrise. Eulalie loved this routine, the gentle chatter, the quiet focus required to create perfect symmetry, and the satisfaction of leaving each client feeling pampered and confident. 

But today, a disquiet hummed beneath the usual calm. A new, unsettling scent – sharp and metallic – mingled with the sweet florals, making Eulalie wrinkle her nose. The music stuttered, then died completely, plunging the salon into an unnerving silence.  A shiver ran down Eulalie’s spine. Something was wrong. Very wrong.  


The setting is a small, charming, and slightly quirky nail salon in a quiet suburban neighborhood called Maplewood. It's filled with bright colors, vintage decor, and the comforting warmth of a well-loved space.
