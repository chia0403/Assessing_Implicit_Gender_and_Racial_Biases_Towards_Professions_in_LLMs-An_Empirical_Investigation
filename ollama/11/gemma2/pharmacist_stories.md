The bell above the door to "Apothecary & Co." chimed softly as Eleanor Thistlewick adjusted her spectacles and peered over the counter. Rain lashed against the dusty windows, blurring the already dim street outside. The air within the shop was thick with the scent of lavender oil, old paper, and a faint, lingering aroma of cinnamon – a reminder of last week's batch of elderberry syrup. 

Eleanor sighed, smoothing down her starched white apron. It had been a slow morning.  A few coughs, a bruised knee, a desperate request for a hangover cure – the usual mundane ailments that peppered life in this sleepy corner of Yorkshire. But lately, there had been something different, something unsettling, hanging in the air. A subtle hum, a whisper on the wind, like secrets being shared just beyond her hearing. 


It wasn't until the bell chimed again, announcing a new customer, that Eleanor truly felt the hairs on the back of her neck prickle with unease.
