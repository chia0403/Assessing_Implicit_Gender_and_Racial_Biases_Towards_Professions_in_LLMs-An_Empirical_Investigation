Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Jack Hartigan’s office, each drop a drumbeat in the symphony of urban misery. The air was thick with the smell of damp concrete and stale cigarettes, a scent that had become as familiar to him as his own worn leather jacket.  

Jack sat hunched over his desk, a mug of lukewarm coffee growing cold beside a crumpled photograph. The woman in the picture smiled radiantly, her blonde hair cascading down her shoulders.  Clara Beaumont. Missing for three weeks, vanished without a trace from her lavish penthouse apartment overlooking the glittering city skyline. Her husband, a ruthless tycoon named Arthur Beaumont, had offered Jack a hefty sum to find her – a sum that promised to buy him enough time away from the dreary rain and the ghosts of cases past. 


This wasn’t just another missing person case, though. This was Clara Beaumont. The wife of Arthur Beaumont, owner of half the city's real estate, notorious for his shady dealings and ruthlessly ambitious nature.  Jack knew he was stepping into a web spun with secrets, lies, and perhaps even murder. He just hoped the coffee wouldn't turn cold before he got to the bottom of it.
