The Parisian air hung thick with the scent of rain and fresh croissants as Eloise Dubois-Lef√®vre adjusted her spectacles, squinting at the dilapidated building before her. It was a three-story structure, once grand but now shrouded in a veil of neglect, its facade marred by cracked paint and broken windowpanes. Ivy crept up its brick walls like grasping fingers, threatening to engulf the entire edifice. 

Eloise, a renowned architect with a penchant for restoring forgotten beauty, saw not decay, but potential. In her mind, she could already envision the elegant lines of a renovated foyer, the sun streaming through newly installed skylights onto polished hardwood floors, and laughter echoing from a vibrant courtyard blooming with life. This building, this neglected relic, was her next canvas.
