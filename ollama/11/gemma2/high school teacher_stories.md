The bell shrieked, a metallic banshee tearing through Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Blackwood’s carefully curated calm. She sighed, smoothing down the wrinkles in her tweed skirt before turning to face the unruly horde that had descended upon her history classroom. The room itself was a testament to the enduring power of routine: rows of desks stained with the ghosts of countless forgotten lunches, maps and timelines pinned haphazardly to faded bulletin boards, and a dusty globe perpetually spinning off-kilter thanks to an overzealous student named Timmy who insisted on “showing us the world.” 

Eleanor loved this room. The chipped paint, the smell of old paper and ambition, the constant hum of teenage energy – it was her world, her stage. She’d spent the last ten years molding minds in these very rows, nurturing a love for history in the hearts (and occasionally, the reluctant brains) of countless students.  But today, Eleanor felt a gnawing unease. A premonition, perhaps, or maybe just a particularly strong cup of coffee. Either way, something was different. The air crackled with an uncharacteristic tension, and her usual pep talk about the French Revolution seemed to fall flat. She glanced at the clock – 3:15 PM – and felt the weight of impending dismissal settle over her like a shroud. This wasn't just another day. This, she knew, was the start of something... different.
