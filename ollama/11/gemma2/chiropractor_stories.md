The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Eleanor Vance's waiting room. The scent of lavender and chamomile from the diffuser mingled with the faint aroma of freshly brewed Earl Grey tea, a comforting welcome for patients seeking relief from their aches and pains. A vintage record player played soft jazz in the background, its melody creating a peaceful ambiance that contrasted sharply with the tension often etched on her patients' faces when they entered. Eleanor, with her warm smile and reassuring presence, had dedicated her life to helping people move beyond pain and find balance within their bodies. 

She glanced at the clock: 4:58 pm. Just two minutes until Daniel Hayes, a promising young marathon runner, would walk through the door, hoping she could help him reclaim his stride after a recent injury threatened to derail his dreams.
