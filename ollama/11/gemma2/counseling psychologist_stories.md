The scent of rain-soaked earth clung to Dr. Eleanor Beaumont’s tweed coat as she stepped out of her office building. Seattle in late autumn was a symphony of greys - slate skies mirroring the weathered brick facades, wind whipping fallen leaves into swirling eddies on the pavement.  A chill seeped through her cardigan, reminding her she should have donned an extra layer before leaving the relative warmth of her small practice nestled amidst a quiet corner of Ballard.

Eleanor sighed, pushing back the hood of her coat against the damp air. Another day, another tide of anxieties and neuroses flowing through her office doors. It wasn’t always easy, navigating the labyrinthine complexities of the human mind, but Eleanor found solace in the small victories – a flicker of hope in a patient's eyes, a hesitant laugh breaking through the tension. 


It was moments like these that fueled her dedication to her work. She had chosen this path for one reason: to help people find their way back to the light, even when it seemed lost amongst the shadows.
