The air hung thick with the scent of hay and damp earth. Dew clung to the emerald green stalks of the alfalfa field, shimmering like scattered emeralds in the pre-dawn light.  Amelia Rose Butterfield knelt beside the sturdy chestnut mare, whispering soothing words into her velvety ears as she meticulously cleaned her hooves. Amelia, a woman whose weathered hands spoke of years spent tending to creatures great and small, was already at work on her sprawling farm nestled deep in the rolling hills of Vermont.

Amelia carried on the tradition with unwavering dedication, treating each creature under her care as if they were her own child.

It spoke of an imminent threat to her farm, one she couldn't have anticipated...and would have to face with courage and a heart full of love for the animals who relied on her.
