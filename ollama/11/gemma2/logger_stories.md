The dawn crept over Mount Rainier, painting the snow-capped peak in hues of pink and orange before it bled into the hazy blue sky. The crisp air bit at Elara Blackwood's cheeks as she stepped out of her cabin, her breath puffing white clouds in the stillness.  

Elara Blackwood wasn't your typical logger. Most men in these parts scoffed at a woman wielding a chainsaw, but Elara was more than capable. She inherited her father’s grit and knew every inch of this forest like the back of her hand. Her calloused hands, roughened by years of felling giants and wrestling with fallen timber, held the weight of generations past. This was her legacy, her blood, her life – the whispering pines, the rustling leaves, the scent of damp earth after a summer rain. 


The forest stretched before her, an emerald tapestry woven with sunlight and shadows. The rhythmic chirping of birds filled the air, a counterpoint to the distant drone of chainsaws already echoing through the trees.  Today was Elara's first day back on the job after a grueling winter spent repairing her cabin and tending her small orchard. The silence felt heavy, expectant, almost... ominous.
