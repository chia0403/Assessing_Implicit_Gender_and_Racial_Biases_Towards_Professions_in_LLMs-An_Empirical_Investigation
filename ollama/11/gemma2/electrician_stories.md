The humid Louisiana air clung to Elias Beaumont like a second skin as he wrestled with the stubborn conduit. Sweat dripped from his brow, mingling with the grime already staining his faded blue work shirt. The smell of old wiring and damp earth filled his nostrils, a familiar aroma that always seemed to accompany him on these house calls in the decaying heart of New Orleans. Elias wasn't afraid of hard work, or of the city's crumbling infrastructure, but today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine, like a loose wire shorting out. The old Victorian mansion loomed above him, its ornate wrought iron balcony creaking ominously in the wind. He adjusted the worn leather strap of his toolbox and took a deep breath, steeling himself for whatever this house had in store.


This was no ordinary wiring job.  Elias, nicknamed "Sparks" by his friends for his quick wit and even quicker hands with a wire stripper, had been called here by Mrs. Evangeline Dubois, a reclusive woman who lived alone in the mansion. She claimed something was wrong with the house's electrical system, that lights flickered inexplicably and appliances hummed with a strange, unsettling energy. Elias had dismissed it as faulty wiring at first, but now, standing on the overgrown porch, he felt a creeping sense of foreboding.
