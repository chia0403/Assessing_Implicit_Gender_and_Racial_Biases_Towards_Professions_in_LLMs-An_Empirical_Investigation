The air hung thick with the scent of sizzling garlic and frying onions, a symphony of aromas that always clung to Amelia Josephine "Amy" Finch like a second skin. The diner was her playground, a chaotic ballet of clattering plates, clinking glasses, and shouted orders. 

She loved the rush of it all: taking down orders with lightning speed, memorizing faces and regular drinks, weaving through tables laden with steaming platters and bottomless coffee cups. Amy moved like a dancer, graceful and efficient, her red apron flapping behind her as she navigated the cramped space.  The worn vinyl booths, sticky from years of spilled ketchup and forgotten dreams, seemed to hum with a low murmur of countless conversations overheard. 

Tonight, however, the diner felt different. The usual boisterous energy was replaced by an unsettling quiet. A lone couple sat in a corner booth, their faces illuminated by the flickering light of a shared ashtray. Behind the counter, old man Gus, the owner and resident grumpy cynic, stared out the window with an expression Amy couldn't decipher. 


The clock ticked past ten, its steady rhythm a reminder that closing time was fast approaching. This wasn't unusual for a Tuesday night in this forgotten corner of town, but something about the heavy silence seemed to press down on Amy, making her skin prickle with unease.
