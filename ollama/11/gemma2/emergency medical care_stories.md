The rain hammered against the windshield like tiny fists, blurring the city lights into an impressionistic watercolour mess. Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Carter gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white under the harsh glare of the dashboard lights. The sirens wailed, a mournful counterpoint to the steady drumming of the downpour.  

Tonight was proving to be one for the books, even by Amy's standards. It felt like every emergency call had escalated from "mild inconvenience" to "full-blown catastrophe." She’d patched up a drunk who’d taken a tumble off his balcony (thankfully, landing on a pile of conveniently placed patio furniture), stabilized a woman experiencing severe anaphylactic shock after a rogue bee sting (during a Shakespeare in the Park performance, no less), and now… she was racing towards a reported explosion at a local bakery. 

Amy glanced at her partner, Danny, his face illuminated by the flashing red lights reflecting off his shaved head. He hummed along to the old-school rock blasting from the radio, a strange juxtaposition to their current predicament. 

"Fingers crossed it's just an oven malfunction," Amy muttered, more to herself than Danny. "Wouldn't want to be covered in flour and icing during this storm."


The ambulance lurched around a corner, its headlights cutting through the driving rain, revealing a scene of chaos. The bakery was engulfed in flames, thick black smoke billowing into the sky. People stood huddled on the sidewalk, their faces etched with fear and worry. 

Amy's heart pounded against her ribs. This wasn't just another night shift.  This was real. And someone needed her.
