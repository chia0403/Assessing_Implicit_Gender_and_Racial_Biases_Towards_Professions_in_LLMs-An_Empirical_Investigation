The stale air of the office hung thick with desperation, punctuated by the rhythmic clatter of Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Davenport's keyboard as she wrestled with another mountain of invoices.  It was tax season, the annual pilgrimage into the underworld of receipts and deductions, where sanity went to die a slow, bureaucratic death. Amy, usually a woman who found solace in spreadsheets and numbered lists, felt her usual calm crumbling like a poorly constructed ledger. 

The setting sun cast long, orange shadows across the cramped cubicle farm at Davenport & Sons Accounting, casting the fluorescent lights in an unsettling glow. Outside, the wind howled through the skeletal branches of autumn trees lining Main Street in their sleepy Midwestern town of Harmony Creek, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Amy's soul.  She glanced at the clock – 6:57 pm. The familiar ache of loneliness gnawed at her as she imagined everyone else enjoying a leisurely dinner and a warm evening with loved ones. But for Amy, home was just another cubicle in this concrete jungle, devoid of laughter or companionship. 


Her phone buzzed on her desk. It was her father, Arthur Davenport Sr., reminding her about the mandatory family dinner at their usual spot – The Golden Spoon Diner. He never understood why she couldn't just leave work earlier, join him for a greasy burger and endless banter about the state of local politics.

Amy sighed, pressing the phone to her ear with a practiced smile. "On my way, Dad."  


But even as she spoke, a flicker of defiance sparked in her eyes. Tonight, something felt different. Maybe it was the wind howling outside, or perhaps the gnawing loneliness had finally grown too unbearable. Whatever the reason, Amy knew that tomorrow would be different. She wouldn't just exist – she would truly live.
