The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile, sickly yellow glow over the brightly colored posters plastered on the walls of Dr. Evelyn Primrose's office.  Each one promised positivity and emotional well-being, but Evelyn found herself feeling anything but. The worn linoleum floor felt cold beneath her feet, and a faint smell of stale crayons lingered in the air. 

The school counselor's chair, usually a haven for anxious whispers and shared secrets, sat empty. This wasnâ€™t unusual; she often had to share her space with other staff members due to budgetary constraints. However, today felt different. Today, there was an unsettling silence that stretched beyond the confines of the room, a palpable tension hanging in the air like a shroud.  Evelyn traced the rim of her coffee mug, its chipped handle a familiar comfort against her trembling hand. 

Outside, the playground echoed with the joyous screams of children playing tag, oblivious to the storm brewing within the school walls. But Evelyn knew that beneath the surface of carefree laughter, there were secrets, fears, and anxieties waiting to be unearthed. Her gaze drifted towards the half-finished notes on her desk, a file labeled "Samuel Jones" glaring back at her. It was time to face another day in the trenches of childhood, where innocence often collided with darkness.
