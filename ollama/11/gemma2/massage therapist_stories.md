The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a comforting balm against the city's ceaseless roar that seeped through the thin walls of Serenity Spa.  Rain lashed against the windowpanes, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the glass, but inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Bellwether moved with practiced grace, her hands kneading the tense muscles of Mr. Henderson, a stockbroker whose shoulders were perpetually burdened by his volatile career. 

Ellie, a woman of quiet strength and warmth, had found solace in massage after years spent navigating the chaotic world of high-powered finance. The rhythmic pressure of her hands, the soft murmur of her voice as she guided her clients through stretches and breathing exercises, was a symphony of calm in a world that often felt like it was falling apart. 


But tonight, something was different.  The familiar hum of the spa seemed to be tinged with an unsettling undercurrent, a prickling sensation on Ellie's skin that had nothing to do with the heat from the massage table. It wasn't just Mr. Hendersonâ€™s knotted muscles that felt tight; there was an invisible tension in the air itself, a looming sense of foreboding that made even Ellie, a woman who prided herself on her composure, feel a little uneasy.
