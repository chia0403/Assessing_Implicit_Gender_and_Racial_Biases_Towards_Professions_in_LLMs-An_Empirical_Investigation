The sunrise bled across the asphalt like spilled rust, painting the horizon in hues of bruised orange and dusty pink. Dew clung to the weeds sprouting between the cracked concrete dividers, shimmering with trapped diamonds. It was the kind of morning that felt heavy, thick with the promise of heat and mosquitos.  

Elias Finch adjusted his hard hat, its brim shading his eyes from the glare. He could feel the familiar ache in his lower back, a constant companion since he started working on Highway 45 three years ago. Today was another day spent battling potholes, patching asphalt, and dodging impatient drivers who seemed to think the “road work ahead” sign meant “get out of my way.”  

Elias took a long drag from his cigarette, letting the smoke curl up into the humid air. He scanned the construction zone – orange cones standing like sentinels, jackhammers humming their rhythmic song, and his fellow workers already battling the day's heat. A sigh escaped him, the sound lost in the clatter of machinery.  He was just another cog in this endless machine, keeping the wheels of progress turning, one pothole at a time.


**Setting:**

A construction zone on Highway 45, somewhere in rural America. Early morning, summer.
