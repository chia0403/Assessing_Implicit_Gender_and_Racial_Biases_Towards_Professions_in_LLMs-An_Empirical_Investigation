The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Eleanor Vance's head like a chorus of anxious bees. Her reflection in the polished chrome tray stared back at her - tired eyes framed by the ever-present smudges of blue disinfectant and a thin line of worry etched between her brows.  She was perched on the edge of her dental chair, chin resting on her fist, staring at the messy pile of paperwork on the desk before her. It wasn't the invoices or insurance claims that weighed on her; it was the handwritten note tucked amongst them.

"Eleanor," it began, in a familiar scrawling hand, "We need to talk. - Mom."


The waiting room of Vance Family Dental was bathed in the sterile white glow of midday sun, filtering through the dusty glass panels that overlooked their quiet suburban street.  Families with children clutched colorful toys, nervous couples held hands, and lone figures with furrowed brows scrolled through their phones. The familiar scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of cinnamon from the potpourri simmering in a ceramic bowl near the reception desk. Eleanor had spent her entire life within these walls - watching generations of patients come and go, celebrating milestones, comforting anxieties, and patching up more than just teeth. But today, the clinic felt different, heavy with unspoken words and an impending storm that threatened to shatter the fragile peace she'd built.
