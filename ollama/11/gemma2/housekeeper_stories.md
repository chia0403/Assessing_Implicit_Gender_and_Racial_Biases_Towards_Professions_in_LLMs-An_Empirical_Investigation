The scent of lemon polish hung heavy in the air, thick as the humid July morning clinging to Amelia Thistlewick's skin. Sweat prickled at her temples despite the cool tile floor beneath her worn-out slippers.  Sunlight streamed through the enormous windows of the manor house, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. Each one seemed a miniature sun, mocking Amelia's efforts to keep this sprawling estate sparkling. The grand oak table, polished until it gleamed like a mirror, was already set for breakfast - an unnecessary extravagance for a family so rarely home. This, Amelia knew, was the life sheâ€™d chosen: tending to the forgotten corners of wealth, scrubbing away the evidence of lives lived elsewhere. 


The manor, known as "Whispering Pines" by locals and a source of endless whispered tales amongst the village gossips, loomed above her like a watchful giant. Its ivy-covered walls held secrets, Amelia knew that much. But those secrets were not hers to uncover. Her domain was the meticulously maintained surfaces, the spotless linen, the unspoken rules of domestic order. She was the invisible hand keeping this world running, a cog in a vast and indifferent machine.
