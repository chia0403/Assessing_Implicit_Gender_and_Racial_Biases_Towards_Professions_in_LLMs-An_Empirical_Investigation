The stale air hung thick with the scent of recycled cabin oxygen and lukewarm coffee as Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne glided down the aisle of Flight 347. Her smile was fixed, bright and professional, masking the weariness that settled deep in her bones after twelve grueling hours on the job. The plane hummed beneath her feet, a metal leviathan hurtling across the vast, star-dusted canvas of night. Outside the tiny window, the moon cast an ethereal glow on the sprawling expanse of cloud cover, obscuring any glimpse of the world below. 

Amelia glanced at the cabin monitor, its flickering green numbers reflecting in her tired eyes: cruising altitude 35,000 feet, time remaining 4 hours and 17 minutes.  She braced herself for the next few hours – the symphony of snoring passengers, the occasional panicked child, the endless requests for blankets and pretzels. It was all part of the job, just another night in her life as a stewardess for Air Zenith Airways.

But tonight felt different. A prickling sensation danced along Amelia's skin, an intuition that whispered something was amiss. She couldn't pinpoint it – perhaps it was the way the passengers seemed unusually quiet, or the unsettling silence from the cockpit, broken only by the rhythmic hum of the engines. Whatever it was, Amelia knew she needed to stay vigilant. Something wasn't right.
