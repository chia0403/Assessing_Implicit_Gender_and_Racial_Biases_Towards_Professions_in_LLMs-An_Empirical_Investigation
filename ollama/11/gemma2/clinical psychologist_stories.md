The aroma of stale coffee and anxiety hung heavy in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s cramped office. Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mirroring the storm brewing within her latest patient, Sarah.  Eleanor sat across from her, perched on the edge of her too-worn leather chair, her gaze fixed on the swirling patterns of a particularly agitated goldfish in its small bowl beside her desk. 

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the cluttered room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and the stack of unread journals threatening to topple from Eleanor's overflowing bookshelf. Outside, the city hummed with a frenetic energy that seemed oblivious to the turmoil unfolding within these four walls. But inside, Eleanor felt a familiar tug – the pull of another unraveling mind, another story waiting to be unraveled. 


Sarah’s voice, laced with tremors and desperation, filled the silence: “I just… I don’t know who I am anymore, Dr. Vance. It feels like everything is falling apart.”
