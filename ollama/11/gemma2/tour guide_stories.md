The midday sun beat down on Amelia Celeste Thorne's neck as she led her small group of tourists through the overgrown ruins of ancient Teotihuacan. Sweat trickled down her temple, mixing with the dust kicked up by their shuffling feet.  Amelia adjusted the brim of her wide-brimmed hat and plastered a cheerful smile on her face, even though the heat was starting to make her feel like a wilting sunflower. 

"And as you can see," she announced, gesturing dramatically towards the crumbling pyramid towering before them, "this is the Pyramid of the Sun, the largest structure in all of Teotihuacan!"  Her voice carried over the quiet murmurings of the tourists, most of whom were already struggling with the altitude and unforgiving Mexican sun. 

Amelia, however, thrived on the heat. She was a native of this city, born and raised amidst its dusty plazas and ancient stories. The history of Teotihuacan pulsed through her veins like a second heartbeat.  She knew every crumbling stone, every whisper of wind that carried the echoes of forgotten rituals. It was her passion, her purpose - to share these secrets with the world, one captivated tourist at a time.
