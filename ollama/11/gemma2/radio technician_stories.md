The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and burnt coffee in Silas Blackwood’s workshop. A symphony of static crackled from the dozen or so radios he'd salvaged over the years – some vintage beauties, others cobbled-together Frankensteinian contraptions held together by duct tape and sheer hope. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee through the skeletal branches of the oak trees that fringed his ramshackle cabin on the edge of Dustbowl Ridge. 

Silas, a man whose calloused hands spoke volumes about his years tinkering with delicate circuitry, hunched over his workbench. A tangle of wires snaked across its surface, leading to a hulking receiver he'd affectionately dubbed "The Leviathan." It was his latest project – a behemoth capable of picking up signals from across the country, even rumored whispers from beyond.  

He tightened the last connection, his brow furrowed in concentration. He could feel the anticipation thrumming through him like a live wire. Tonight, he was going to listen. Not just to the usual chatter of smugglers and desperate pleas for help that permeated the airwaves, but something more – something whispered about in hushed tones around campfires, something that could change everything.
