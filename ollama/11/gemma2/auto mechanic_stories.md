The grease under Amelia "Amy" Rose's fingernails was more like a second skin. It felt familiar, comforting even, in contrast to the grit and grime that perpetually clung to the air within her garage, Rosie's Rustbusters. The shop itself was an old two-story brick building on the outskirts of Elmwood, its faded paint peeling like sunburnt skin. A rusty sign, held aloft by a rickety chain, proclaimed its name with more enthusiasm than reality warranted.  

Inside, engine parts spilled from metal shelves like forgotten memories, and tools hung haphazardly from hooks, their metallic gleam mirroring the glint in Amy's eye. The air hummed with the rhythmic thrum of machinery, punctuated by the occasional clang of a wrench or the hiss of escaping steam. 

A greasy rag clutched in her hand, Amy surveyed the engine before her, its exposed innards glistening under the dim fluorescent light. This wasn't just any engine; it belonged to a vintage Mustang, a beauty with curves like a siren and a growl that echoed through Elmwood on Sundays. Amy loved a challenge, especially when it involved rescuing a classic from oblivion. 


This particular Mustang had been brought in by Mr. Henderson, the town's grumpy but secretly sentimental history teacher. He claimed this car was his late wife's pride and joy, and he wanted it running again for their anniversary. It was Amy's job to make that happen.
