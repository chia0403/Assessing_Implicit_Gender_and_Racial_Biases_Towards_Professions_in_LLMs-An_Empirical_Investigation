The late afternoon sun bled through the dusty blinds of Ms. Amelia Rosewater's classroom, painting stripes of orange across the worn linoleum floor.  A lone cough echoed from the back corner where six-year-old Finnigan O’Malley sat hunched over his unfinished drawing.  Amelia sighed, adjusting the floral headband that perpetually threatened to slip off her unruly auburn curls. It was the third day of spring break and Amelia's "classroom makeover" project had turned into a Sisyphean task.  She'd envisioned a vibrant space bursting with color and creativity, but now it felt more like an abandoned craft fair after a hurricane.


The aroma of freshly baked cookies wafted in from the kitchen, courtesy of Mrs. Peterson, her eternally cheerful neighbor who lived above the school. Amelia could hear the clatter of dishes and the muffled laughter of Mrs. Peterson's grandson, Billy, bouncing a basketball down the hallway.  

Amelia pushed back a stray strand of hair and surveyed the mess. A half-deflated balloon dog lay limp on the floor, its once bright colors now faded and dusty. Sheets of paper covered in crayon scribbles littered the desks, each one a testament to the boundless energy and imagination of her students. She ran a hand over a particularly impressive mural depicting a rainbow unicorn riding a rocket ship through space. A small pang of sadness hit Amelia - she missed her class terribly.


Suddenly, a loud bang from the hallway shattered the peaceful afternoon.  Amelia's heart leapt into her throat.  She grabbed the nearest object – a half-painted papier-mâché globe – and cautiously approached the door, holding it slightly ajar.
