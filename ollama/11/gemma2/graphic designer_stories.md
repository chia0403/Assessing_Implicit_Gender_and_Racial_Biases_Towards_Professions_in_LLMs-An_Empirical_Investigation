The harsh fluorescent lights of the "Creative Solutions" office buzzed overhead like an agitated swarm of bees, casting a sickly yellow pallor over everything. Amelia Beatrice Thornton, or Amy as she preferred, hunched deeper into her ergonomic chair, squinting at the screen in front of her. A migraine throbbed behind her right eye, mirroring the throbbing headache she felt radiating from the mess on the screen: an amateurish flyer promoting a "Dog Agility Extravaganza" that looked like it was designed by someone who had never seen a dog let alone one performing tricks. 

Amy sighed, rubbing her temples with tired fingers. This wasn't what she'd envisioned when she'd graduated top of her class at Parsons and landed this prestigious job at Creative Solutions. She'd dreamed of sleek logos for innovative tech companies, not cringeworthy flyers for local dog shows. But then again, dreams rarely lived up to reality. 


The cramped office was a symphony of distractions: the frantic tapping of keyboards, the low murmur of phone calls, and the occasional excited shriek from Brenda in marketing who seemed perpetually on the verge of a breakthrough (or at least that's what she claimed every hour). Amy longed for the quiet solitude of her own apartment, where she could blast music and pour over design concepts without the constant pressure to "think outside the box" or "deliver something fresh." But rent was due in three days, and this job, frustrating as it was, paid the bills.
