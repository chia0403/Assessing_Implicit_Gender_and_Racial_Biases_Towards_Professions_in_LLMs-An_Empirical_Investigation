The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne's head, casting a sterile glow on the rows of gleaming instruments laid out before her. The familiar scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingled with the faint, metallic tang of blood and fear – the intoxicating perfume of Dr. Barnes’ practice. 

Amelia loved this time of day: the pre-lunch lull when the anxieties of the morning had settled and a quiet anticipation hung in the air. She meticulously polished each instrument, her movements precise and practiced, a silent ballet of preparation for the afternoon's flurry of patients. Outside, the sun dipped towards the horizon, casting long shadows across the manicured lawns of the affluent suburb where Dr. Barnes’ practice stood, a beacon of gleaming white against the dusty pink of the twilight sky.


This was Amelia's world: the familiar tick-tock of the wall clock, the whirring hum of the suction machine, and the soft chatter of patients trying to distract themselves from the inevitable probing.
