The humid Florida air hung heavy, thick with the scent of salt and chlorine from the overflowing community pool across the street.  Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, her crisp white blouse already clinging uncomfortably to her back, sighed as she squinted at the paperwork on her desk. 

Another claim. Another homeowner lamenting a burst pipe or a lightning strike. Eleanor had seen it all in her twenty years selling homeowners insurance in Cypress Creek, Florida - hurricanes that ripped shingles off roofs, sinkholes swallowing driveways whole, even a rogue iguana infestation that left an entire backyard decimated. But today felt different.  Today, the air crackled with something unsettling, a tension that went beyond the usual August heat and humidity. 


Eleanor glanced at the clock on her wall - 2:57 pm. Just three minutes until Mr. Henderson arrived. He was the owner of the infamous Cypress Creek Manor, a sprawling Victorian mansion rumored to be haunted since its construction in the late 1800s.  He wanted to add extra coverage for "paranormal activity," a clause Eleanor had never encountered before. A shiver ran down her spine. Perhaps today wouldn't be so ordinary after all.
