Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Peterson’s cramped office, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Rose Thornton's heart.  Amelia, a physician's assistant with a touch lighter than cotton and eyes that held the empathy of a saint, pressed her forehead against the cool glass. The wind howled outside, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and something else...something metallic. 

Dr. Peterson’s office was nestled in the heart of Havenwood, a sleepy town clinging to the edge of the Appalachian Mountains. Nestled between rolling hills and whispering pines, Havenwood had always been known for its quaint charm and quietude. But lately, a creeping unease had settled over the town like a shroud. The whispers started subtly - a misplaced object here, a sudden chill there, an unsettling feeling that something was amiss. Now, with each torrential downpour, the whispers grew louder, more insistent, tinged with fear.  And tonight, they were punctuated by the metallic scent that clung to Amelia's nostrils like a premonition.  


Tonight felt different. Tonight, something was truly wrong.
