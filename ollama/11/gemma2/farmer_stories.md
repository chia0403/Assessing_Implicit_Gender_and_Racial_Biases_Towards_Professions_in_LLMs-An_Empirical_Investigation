The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewood's fields like a damp shroud, obscuring the rolling hills beyond his farm and swallowing the distant chirps of birds. A chill wind snaked through the rows of barley, rustling the tall stalks and sending shivers down Bartâ€™s spine despite his thick wool sweater. He tugged his cap lower, shielding his eyes from the weak light filtering through the haze. This was a day for hard work, a day to fight against the encroaching cold that threatened his harvest and his livelihood.  

Bart's farm, Thistlewood Manor, had been in his family for generations, each successive owner carving out their own corner of this rugged, windswept land nestled on the edge of the Northumbrian moors. The old stone farmhouse, with its moss-covered roof and weather-beaten walls, stood like a sentinel against the elements, its windows glowing warmly in contrast to the bleakness outside. Within those walls, Bart's heart beat with the rhythm of the seasons, his life bound inextricably to the land he tilled.
