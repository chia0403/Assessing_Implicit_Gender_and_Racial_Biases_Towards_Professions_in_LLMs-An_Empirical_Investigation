The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thistlewick's head like a chorus of nervous cicadas.  Her office, tucked away in the bowels of Northwood High, felt more like a padded cell than a haven for stressed teenagers. Posters with motivational slogans like "Dream Big!" and "Be the Change!" clashed jarringly against the faded floral wallpaper, creating an aesthetic that could only be described as 'mid-century malaise.' 

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Another day, another parade of anxieties and existential dread. She glanced at the clock â€“ 9:02 am.  First appointment in five minutes: Kevin O'Malley, Sophomore, struggling with algebra and possibly alienating his entire basketball team. Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the onslaught. Maybe she'd brew some chamomile tea later. It wouldn't be enough to soothe her soul, but it might help calm the ever-present tremor in her hands.
