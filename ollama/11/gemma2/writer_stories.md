Outside, London was drowning in November grey; inside, her tiny attic apartment felt like a tomb, thick with dust motes dancing in the weak light filtering through grimy panes.  Eleanor hunched over her battered laptop, its glow a pale counterpoint to the shadows that stretched across her cramped writing desk. 

The deadline loomed, a monstrous shadow cast by the publisher's insistent emails. She needed to finish the third act of her historical fantasy novel, "The Serpent King's Daughter," and yet the words refused to come.  Every sentence she wrote felt hollow, every character flat and lifeless. The magic that had once flowed so easily from her fingertips now seemed as distant and unreachable as the sun behind the storm clouds.

A pang of nostalgia hit her â€“ a bittersweet reminder of happier days before the crippling writer's block had set in, before she had become a prisoner in her own chaotic apartment.
