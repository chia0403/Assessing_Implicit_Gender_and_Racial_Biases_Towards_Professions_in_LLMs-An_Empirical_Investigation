The sun beat down on Silas Jasper Blackwood's worn leather hat as he gripped the steering wheel of his rig, "Ol' Bessie," a 1987 Peterbilt 359 with more miles than sense. The air inside the cab was thick with the scent of stale coffee and diesel, punctuated by the rhythmic hum of the engine rumbling beneath him. Silas squinted through the dust kicked up by a passing pickup truck, his eyes scanning the endless stretch of asphalt ribboning out before him.

He was cruising down Highway 81, just outside Amarillo, Texas, a place where the sky seemed to touch the earth and time moved at its own languid pace. The day was already scorching, promising a brutal summer heat wave settling over the Panhandle. Yet, Silas was unfazed. He thrived in this environment, a solitary warrior battling the elements and deadlines with a gruff determination etched on his weathered face. 


He'd been hauling freight for over twenty years, seen more sunsets than he could count, and felt at home in the open road, where the only company he needed was the ghosts of truck stops past and the endless symphony of engines roaring across the plains.
