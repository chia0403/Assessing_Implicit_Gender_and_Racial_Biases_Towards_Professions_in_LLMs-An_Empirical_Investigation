The sticky residue under Elias Thorncroft's mop was a familiar foe.  He knew it wasn't puke â€“ no, this had been engineered by spilled soda and teenage carelessness. The air hung thick with the smell of stale popcorn and desperation in the auditorium of the Grandview High School, its once opulent velvet seats now worn thin by years of adolescent drama and unyielding textbooks. 

Elias paused his swiping, gazing at the stage bathed in the pale light filtering through the dusty curtains. A lone spotlight illuminated a faded tapestry depicting a mythical griffin, its wings forever frozen in mid-flight. It was a poignant reminder that even grandeur could decay, especially when neglected. Just like him.  


Just like Elias Thorncroft, the janitor with more regrets than dust bunnies.
