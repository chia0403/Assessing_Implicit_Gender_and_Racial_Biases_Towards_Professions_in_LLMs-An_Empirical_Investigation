The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Bartholomew's Bookkeeping. Outside, the perpetually gloomy Seattle sky drizzled its misery onto the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, nestled between towering stacks of invoices and receipts that threatened to consume the entire office, sat Eleanor Beatrice Finch. She was a woman who lived for spreadsheets and deductions, her life governed by the rhythmic click-clack of her calculator keys.  Her normally meticulous bun had come undone, strands of grey escaping like rebellious commas from its confines, mirroring the chaos unfolding before her. 

Mr. Bartholomew, a portly man whose girth rivaled that of the ancient oak tree outside his office window, stood with hands clasped behind his back, staring at Eleanor with an expression that could curdle milk. His usually jovial face was drawn tight, his cheeks pale beneath his ever-present moustache. 

“Eleanor, dear,” he began, his voice cracking like a rusty hinge. “We have a problem.”


The rain pounded against the windowpane, its relentless drumming echoing the anxiety gnawing at Eleanor's insides. This wasn't just another tax discrepancy or a missing receipt – this was something different, something far more unsettling.
