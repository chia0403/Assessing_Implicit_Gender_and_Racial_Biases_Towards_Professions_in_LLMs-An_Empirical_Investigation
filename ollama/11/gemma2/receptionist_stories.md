The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Beatrice Finch’s head like a chorus of bored bees, each buzz a tiny reminder that time was ticking by, and she wasn't getting any closer to her lunch break. She tapped her manicured nails against the worn laminate countertop, the rhythmic click-clack a futile attempt to drown out the droning office chatter filtering through the thin walls. Eloise longed for a escape from the beige monotony of Dr. Peterson’s practice. 

The waiting room was populated with its usual collection of anxious patients – sniffling children clutching stuffed animals, harried mothers juggling phones and toddlers, and elderly couples whispering hushed worries. It was all so predictable, so mundane.  Eloise dreamed of a life less ordinary, one filled with adventure and intrigue, far from the sterile confines of Dr. Peterson’s office in bustling downtown Portland.
