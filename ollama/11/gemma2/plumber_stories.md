Rain lashed against the warped corrugated iron roof of Benny "The Wrench" Worthington's workshop, each drop sounding like a hammer blow against the tired metal. A wind so fierce it tore at loose shingles whistled through cracks in the weathered walls, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and the metallic tang of storm drain runoff. Inside, the dim light from a single bare bulb illuminated Benny, hunched over a workbench cluttered with tools, spare parts, and greasy rags. 

His face, weathered like the roof above him, was creased with concentration as he meticulously disassembled a leaky faucet, muttering under his breath about the "absolute hack-job" who'd installed it in the first place. Benny, known throughout the city for his quick wit and even quicker wrench, wasn't just any plumber â€“ he was a master of his trade, capable of fixing anything from a dribbling tap to a collapsed sewer line with the same gruff efficiency.  

But tonight, the storm raged outside, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Benny. His daughter, Lily, was graduating high school tomorrow, and for the first time in years, he felt truly afraid. Not of failing her, but of letting himself be swallowed by the shadows that always threatened to engulf him. 


Would he be able to face his past long enough to celebrate her future?
