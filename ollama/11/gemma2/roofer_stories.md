The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's back like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes as he crouched precariously on the peak of Mrs. Peterson's Victorian mansion. The scent of fresh tar and hot shingles filled the air, mingling with the faint aroma of honeysuckle that drifted from the rambling garden below. 

Eli shifted his weight, feeling the familiar creak of the aging roof timbers beneath him. He was used to the precarious dance of a roofer - always balancing on the edge, forever one misplaced step away from disaster. But today, something felt different. The air buzzed with an unsettling energy, a prickling at the back of his neck that had nothing to do with the heat. 


The quaint town of Maple Creek, nestled amidst rolling green hills and bordered by whispering forests, was usually a haven of peaceful routine. Yet, beneath its idyllic surface, Eli sensed something was amiss. A shadow loomed, heavy and unseen, threatening to disrupt the familiar rhythm of their lives.
