Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Wanderlust Escapes," blurring the vibrant posters showcasing turquoise beaches, snow-capped mountains, and ancient ruins. Inside, Eloise Moreau, her auburn hair escaping its bun in damp tendrils, sighed as she stared at the blinking cursor on her computer screen. 

The once bustling travel agency felt eerily quiet. A single "Sold!" sticker clung to a brochure for a Tuscan villa escape, a painful reminder of happier times before the pandemic decimated the industry. Eloise had poured her heart and soul into Wanderlust Escapes, building it from the ground up after inheriting a small sum from her grandmother.  Now, with cancellations piling up faster than new bookings, Eloise wondered if she should pack it all in and pursue a more stable career.

But then, a chime resonated from the entrance, breaking the silence. A figure, shrouded in a dark coat and clutching a worn leather suitcase, stepped inside. Hope flickered in Eloise's chest. Perhaps this was the client who would reignite her passion for travel, the one who needed Wanderlust Escapes to guide them on their next adventure.
