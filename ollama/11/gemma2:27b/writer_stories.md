Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frantic drumming in Eliza Cavendish’s chest. The ancient typewriter sat before her, its keys gleaming dully under the single bare bulb casting an anemic yellow across the cluttered space. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated like miniature constellations. Eliza chewed on her thumbnail, her gaze darting between the half-finished manuscript and the storm raging outside.

The attic, a forgotten sanctuary in her grandmother’s sprawling Victorian manor, was Eliza's writing haven. Stacks of leather-bound books threatened to topple over, their pages whispering untold stories. A faded tapestry depicting a fantastical forest hung precariously on one wall, its colours muted by years of neglect. The air smelled faintly of mildew and old paper, a scent Eliza found oddly comforting.  Tonight, though, the usually inspiring atmosphere felt oppressive. Her deadline loomed, a monstrous shadow threatening to swallow her whole.
