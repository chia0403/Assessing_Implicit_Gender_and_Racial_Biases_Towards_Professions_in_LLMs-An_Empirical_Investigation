The Nevada sun beat down on the rusted hood of Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's rig, turning the chrome into a blinding mirror. Dust devils danced across the endless ribbon of asphalt, mocking Eli's desire for a cool breeze and a cold soda. His CB crackled with static and the distant drone of another trucker's voice. 

Eli shifted in his seat, the vinyl groaning beneath him. He’d been hauling this load of steel beams from Reno to Phoenix for what felt like an eternity. The desert stretched on forever, its desolate beauty a stark contrast to the restless ache in Eli's bones. He longed for the familiar comfort of his worn-out recliner back home, the scent of pine needles and woodsmoke filling his tiny cabin. 

But there were bills to pay, a mortgage hanging over his head like a storm cloud. And besides, the open road called to him, whispering tales of freedom and adventure. Even if those tales were sometimes drowned out by the monotonous hum of his engine.  


Eli gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white against the cracked leather. Today, he felt it more acutely than usual – the loneliness that gnawed at him, a constant companion on these long hauls. He yearned for connection, a friendly face, a conversation that didn't revolve around fuel prices and road closures.  

As he crested a gentle rise, his gaze caught something glinting in the distance. A shimmer of silver against the ochre backdrop. Curiosity piqued, Eli eased off the accelerator. Maybe it was just another mirage, playing tricks on his tired eyes. Or maybe… something else entirely.
