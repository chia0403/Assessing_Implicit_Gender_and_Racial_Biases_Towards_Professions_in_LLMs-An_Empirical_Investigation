The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Strike Diner" cast a sickly green glow across Jasper Montgomery's grease-stained hands as he wrestled with the ancient wiring inside. The air hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and frying bacon, a greasy fog that clung to his overalls like a second skin. Outside, the desert wind howled, whipping sand against the diner's windows, making the whole building tremble. Jasper swore under his breath, his headlamp beam dancing wildly as he tried to trace the faulty connection. This wasn't exactly what he had in mind when he dreamt of becoming an electrician â€“ fixing up flickering neon signs in dusty desert towns.

But then again, life rarely goes according to plan. Especially not for someone like Jasper, who had a knack for attracting trouble and a heart too big for his own good. He'd come to Dusty Creek looking for a fresh start, escaping the ghosts of his past that haunted him back east.  He'd hoped to find peace in the silence of the desert, but it seemed the universe had other ideas.

The diner door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and a figure cloaked in shadow. Jasper froze, headlamp beam still frantically searching for the source of the problem.  "You the electrician?" a gruff voice rasped from the darkness.
