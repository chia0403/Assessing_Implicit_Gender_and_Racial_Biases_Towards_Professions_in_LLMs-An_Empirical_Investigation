Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's clinic, blurring the already muted colors of the autumnal foliage outside. A chill wind whistled through the ancient oak trees lining Elm Street, sending shivers down her spine even as she stood inside the warm embrace of her office. Eleanor sighed, her breath fogging the glass. Business was slow today, which wasn't entirely surprising given the dreary weather.

The old Victorian house that housed her practice had a comforting charm, with its high ceilings, creaking floorboards, and lingering scent of lavender from the aromatherapy diffuser she kept humming in the corner. Sunlight rarely reached this part of Elm Street, tucked away as it was between towering brick buildings and shrouded by the ever-present canopy of leaves.  Yet, Eleanor loved her little sanctuary, finding solace in its quietude amidst the bustle of the city. 


Today, however, the silence felt oppressive. She longed for the familiar click of the adjusting table, the whispered relief from patients after a successful treatment, anything to break the monotony. Just as she was contemplating brewing another cup of tea, the bell above the door chimed, jolting her from her reverie.

A tall figure, shrouded in a dark raincoat, stood silhouetted against the gray light spilling in from the doorway. Eleanor straightened her posture, a smile ready on her lips. "Good morning," she greeted, warmth lacing her voice.  "Welcome to Vance Chiropractic. How can I help you?"
