The midday sun beat down on Eliza Marie Hawthorne's neck as she wrestled with a stubborn holly bush. Its roots were like iron cables, clutching desperately at the dry earth.  Eliza huffed, wiping sweat from her brow with the back of her gloved hand. "Come on, you prickly beast," she muttered, heaving again.

She was transforming Mrs. Henderson's front yard from a tangle of overgrown weeds into a haven of vibrant color and calming scents. Lavender bushes would line the walkway, roses would climb the trellis beside the porch, and Eliza had even convinced Mrs. Henderson to try a whimsical gnome statue peeking out from beneath a miniature cherry tree.

Eliza loved bringing beauty to forgotten spaces. It wasn't just about mowing lawns and trimming hedges; it was about creating an oasis for people, a place where they could breathe deep and feel the stress melt away. Today, though, Eliza felt her own serenity slipping.  The insistent buzz of her phone broke through the quiet rhythm of gardening. She knew who it was before she even looked â€“ her brother calling to remind her about their father's birthday dinner tonight. A pang of guilt twisted in her stomach. She hadn't seen their dad since he moved into assisted living, and each missed visit felt like a brick added to the wall separating them.
