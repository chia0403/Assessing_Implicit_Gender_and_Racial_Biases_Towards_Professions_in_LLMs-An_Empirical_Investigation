Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the "Last Chance Saloon," blurring the neon sign that flickered erratically above. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the pungent smell of stale beer. A lone figure sat hunched over a glass of whiskey in the dimly lit corner booth. Amelia Rose Dubois, freelance journalist extraordinaire (or at least, she liked to think so), swirled the amber liquid in her glass, its contents reflecting the tired lines etched around her eyes. 

The story she was chasing had gone cold. A lead on a possible human trafficking ring operating out of the abandoned shipyard had turned into nothing but dead ends and veiled threats. Amelia needed a break, a chance to regroup before the shadows of this city swallowed her whole. But even the familiar sting of whiskey couldn't quell the gnawing unease in her gut. Something wasn't right. The silence was too heavy, the air too tense.
