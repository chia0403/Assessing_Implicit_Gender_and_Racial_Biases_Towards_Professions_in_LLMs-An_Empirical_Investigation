The air hung thick with the scent of vanilla and burnt sugar. Rosalind Amelia Buttercream adjusted her pink-rimmed spectacles and surveyed the carnage on her workbench. Three tiers of chocolate ganache lay lopsided, their smooth surface marred by finger marks and accidental gouges. A cascade of buttercream roses wilted pathetically beside them, victims of Rosalind's mounting frustration.

It was a Tuesday, which meant Tuesdays were for wedding cakes, and this particular Tuesday's cake was proving to be the bane of Rosalind's existence.  Her client, Mrs. Penelope Featherbottom, had requested an elaborate five-tiered confection adorned with sugar lilies, cascading waterfalls of spun sugar, and – the pièce de résistance – a miniature replica of Buckingham Palace crafted entirely from marzipan. 

Rosalind usually thrived under pressure. Her tiny bakery, "Buttercream Dreams," nestled in a cobblestone alleyway behind London's bustling Trafalgar Square, was renowned for its whimsical creations. But Mrs. Featherbottom's order had pushed Rosalind to her limit. The intricate design, coupled with her own exhaustion from a string of late nights, threatened to turn her usual creative joy into a sticky, stressful mess.
