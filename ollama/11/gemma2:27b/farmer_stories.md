The rooster's crow cut through the pre-dawn mist like a rusty scythe, jarring Elara Blackwood from her sleep.  She squinted at the sliver of light peeking through the cracks in her window shutters, judging it to be no later than 4:30 am. The usual symphony of dawn was already beginning – the bleating sheep, the neighing horses, and the distant mooing cows – a comforting chorus for Elara, who’d known nothing but the rhythms of this farm her entire life. Today, however, that familiar comfort held a tinge of anxiety.

The Blackwood farm sat nestled in a verdant valley, its fields stretching out like patchwork quilts under the watchful gaze of the Grey Mountains. Generations of Blackwoods had tilled this land, coaxing life from the soil with sweat and determination. But Elara's generation faced challenges their ancestors hadn’t: dwindling rainfall, rising costs, and the relentless encroachment of development threatening to swallow up their small world. Today was market day in the nearby town of Oakhaven, and Elara needed a good sale – her livelihood depended on it.
