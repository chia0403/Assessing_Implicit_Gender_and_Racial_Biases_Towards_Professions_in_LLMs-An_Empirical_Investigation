Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of La Petite Cocotte, sending shivers through Genevieve Dubois's already chilled bones. The ancient copper pots hanging above her stove clanged rhythmically in protest, each clang echoing the dull ache throbbing behind her eyes. It was past midnight, the bistro empty save for Genevieve and the ghosts of a hundred meals past. Usually, this late-night solitude was a balm, a chance to let the day's culinary anxieties melt away amidst the comforting aroma of simmering herbs and browned butter. But tonight, a sour taste lingered on her tongue, bitterer than any reduction sauce she'd ever concocted.

The news had spread like wildfire through the narrow cobblestone streets of Montmartre: Le Coq d'Or, the Michelin-starred restaurant just down the way, was closing its doors.  And Genevieve knew, with a certainty that chilled her to the bone, that it wouldn't be long before La Petite Cocotte met the same fate.
