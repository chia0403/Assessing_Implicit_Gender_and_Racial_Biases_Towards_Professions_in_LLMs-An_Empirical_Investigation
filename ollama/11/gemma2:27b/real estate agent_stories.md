Rain lashed against the windowpane of Amelia Hawthorne's modest office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. The "For Sale" sign she'd planted in the overgrown yard of the Victorian mansion across the street mocked her with its cheerful red lettering. It had been six months, and not a single serious offer.

Amelia sighed, pushing away a stray curl that threatened to escape her meticulously styled bun. She loved the challenge of finding hidden gems in this sleepy seaside town, but lately, it felt like every property was cursed. This one, with its peeling paint and whispers of hauntings, seemed particularly resistant to charm. The rhythmic tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the corner only amplified the silence of her phone, a stark reminder of the dwindling commissions threatening her livelihood.

The salty tang of the sea breeze wafted through the slightly open window, a familiar scent that usually brought Amelia solace. Today, however, it felt like a cruel taunt, promising escape she couldn't afford.
