Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "The Pillbox," a small, independent pharmacy tucked away on a forgotten corner of Elm Street. The neon "Open" sign flickered intermittently, casting eerie shadows that danced across the cluttered shelves stocked with everything from cough syrup to hair dye. Amelia Blackwood, her auburn hair escaping its loose bun, sighed as she counted out another prescription for antacids, the monotonous task barely registering through the incessant drumming of the rain.

It was a Tuesday night like any other â€“ slow, damp, and utterly devoid of excitement. The only sound besides the downpour was the gentle ticking of the antique clock on the wall, its pendulum swinging with an almost mournful rhythm. Amelia wished for something to break the monotony, anything at all. Little did she know, a storm brewing outside was about to unleash chaos far more dramatic than a simple power outage.
