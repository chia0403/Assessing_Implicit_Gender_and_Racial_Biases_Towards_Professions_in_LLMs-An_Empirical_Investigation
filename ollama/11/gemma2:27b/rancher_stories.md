The sun bled crimson across the endless Montana sky, casting long shadows from the jagged peaks of the Bitterroot Range onto Elias Blackwood’s weathered face. Dust swirled around his worn boots as he surveyed the sprawling expanse of his ranch: Blackrock, named for the obsidian outcropping that jutted from the heart of the property. 

A chill wind snaked through the sagebrush, carrying the faint scent of pine and the distant bleating of sheep. Elias tugged his Stetson lower, shielding his eyes from the harsh glare. He'd been tending these lands since he was a boy, inheriting Blackrock from his grandfather, a gruff but loving man who taught him everything he knew about the land and its creatures. 


But lately, something felt different. A tension hung heavy in the air, an unease that prickled Elias’s skin like static electricity. The herds were restless, their bleating more insistent, more panicked than usual. And the coyotes...they seemed bolder, closer, their mournful howls echoing through the night with unnerving frequency.  Elias wasn't a man easily spooked, but this time, something felt deeply wrong. He squinted at the horizon, his gut twisting with a premonition he couldn’t shake. Something was coming.

What would Elias face on Blackrock? The answers awaited him in the heart of the Montana wilderness.
