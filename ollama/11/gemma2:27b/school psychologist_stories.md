Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her own chest.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn, floral-patterned carpet. Outside, the playground at Maplewood Elementary lay deserted, the swings swaying listlessly in the wind.

Eleanor stared at the referral form in her hand, her brow furrowed. It was for a new student, Liam Carter, a 10-year-old boy transferred from a private school after a series of unsettling incidents. The details were vague: disruptive behavior, social withdrawal, and disturbing drawings that hinted at something darker lurking beneath the surface.

Eleanor had seen her fair share of troubled children in her fifteen years as a school psychologist. But Liam's case felt different, heavy with an unspoken dread she couldn't quite place.  As she reached for the phone to schedule his first appointment, a shiver ran down her spine. Perhaps it was just the cold rain seeping through the windowpanes, or perhaps it was something moreâ€¦ something that whispered of secrets waiting to be unearthed.
