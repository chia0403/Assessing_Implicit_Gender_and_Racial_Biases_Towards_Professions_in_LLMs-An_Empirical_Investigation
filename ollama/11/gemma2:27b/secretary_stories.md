Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Majestic Building, blurring the already hazy cityscape beyond. Amelia Cartwright shivered, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around herself. The air inside was barely warmer, smelling faintly of dust and mothballs, a testament to the building's long-forgotten grandeur. Amelia tapped her perfectly manicured nails on the chipped Formica countertop, waiting for Mr. Hawthorne to finish his interminable phone call.

The Majestic Building once housed a thriving publishing house, but now only a handful of tenants remained, clinging to their spaces like barnacles on a rotting hull. Amelia was Mr. Hawthorne's secretary, a position she'd held for the past five years â€“ or was it ten? Time had a way of blurring in this stagnant place.

Today, however, something felt different. A nervous energy crackled in the air, punctuated by the staccato rhythm of the rain. Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous was about to happen.
