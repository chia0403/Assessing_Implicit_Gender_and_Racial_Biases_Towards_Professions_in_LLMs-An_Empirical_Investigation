The air hung thick with pine needles and damp earth, the scent sharp enough to sting Silas Blackwood's nostrils. A sliver of sun pierced through the canopy, casting dappled shadows across the forest floor where he stood. His calloused hands tightened around the worn handle of his axe, the cold steel biting into his palm despite the heavy work gloves he wore. He squinted up at the towering Douglas fir before him, its rough bark scarred by years of harsh winters and scorching summers. This giant, Silas knew, would provide enough lumber to keep the mill humming for weeks.

Silas Blackwood wasn't a sentimental man, but there was a certain respect he held for these ancient trees, a silent understanding forged in years of working side-by-side with them. He saw their resilience, their unwavering strength against the relentless forces of nature. Yet, he also understood his role: to harvest responsibly, to ensure the forest continued to thrive for generations to come.

Today, though, a knot of unease twisted in Silas's gut. It wasn't the usual apprehension that came with felling a behemoth like this one. This was something different, a prickle on the back of his neck that whispered of hidden danger. As he lifted his axe, the unsettling feeling intensified, and for a fleeting moment, Silas considered calling it a day.
