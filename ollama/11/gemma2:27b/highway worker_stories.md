The Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck, turning his already red face a shade closer to crimson. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the endless expanse of asphalt stretching before him. He wiped his brow with a grimy rag, squinting at the shimmering heatwaves rising from the road.  

Eli was part of a three-man crew tasked with patching up a particularly troublesome stretch of Highway 95, notorious for its potholes that seemed to multiply overnight. The endless monotony of asphalt and dust had become Eli's reality, punctuated only by the occasional roar of a semi-truck barreling past at breakneck speed.

Today, however, felt different. A prickling sensation danced along Eli's skin, an uneasy premonition he couldn't quite shake off. It was more than just the heat; something feltâ€¦off. The silence between him and his fellow workers, usually filled with gruff banter or tired sighs, was heavy and unnerving. Even the desert wind seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something to happen.
