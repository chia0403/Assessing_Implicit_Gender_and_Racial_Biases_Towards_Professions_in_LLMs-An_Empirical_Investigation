Rain lashed against the shop windows, blurring the vibrant colours of the lilies and roses within. Eliza Grace hummed softly, a counterpoint to the drumming storm outside, as she arranged a bouquet of sunflowers - their golden heads drooping slightly under the weight of the downpour.  

Her shop, "Petal & Bloom," nestled in the heart of quaint Willow Creek, was usually abuzz with the chatter of customers and the rustle of leaves from the ancient oak tree shading her front porch. But today, the storm had chased everyone indoors, leaving Eliza alone with her blooms and a quiet ache for human connection.

The bell above the door tinkled unexpectedly, startling her.  A figure shrouded in rain swept inside, shaking droplets onto the worn wooden floor. Eliza's gaze met theirs - piercing green eyes set within a face etched with worry.
