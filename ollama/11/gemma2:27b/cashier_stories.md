The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over everything in the convenience store. Amelia Rose Cartwright sighed, her fingers drumming a tired rhythm against the countertop. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the glass door and sending shivers down Amelia's spine. It was 2:00 AM, the graveyard shift at the "Stop & Go," and boredom had become a tangible entity, settling heavy in her chest. The only sounds were the mournful groan of the ancient refrigerator and the occasional rustle of someone rifling through chips in aisle three.

Amelia longed for the bustle of daytime shoppers, the chatter and laughter that punctuated her shifts then. Now, she was just a lonely sentinel guarding shelves stocked with overpriced candy bars and lukewarm coffee.
