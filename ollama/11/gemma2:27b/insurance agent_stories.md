Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew "Bart" Quince's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation – a pungent cocktail Bart had become intimately familiar with over his ten years as an insurance agent for the struggling firm of Finch & Featherstone. Outside, the neon glow of a liquor store sign flickered erratically, casting grotesque shadows that danced across his cluttered desk. 

Bart stared at the file in front of him, the thin paper already beginning to wrinkle under the weight of his anxiety. Mrs. Evelyn Cavendish, a widow with trembling hands and haunted eyes, had come to him seeking coverage for her son, Theodore, a daredevil stuntman who seemed hell-bent on defying gravity itself. Bart knew the risks involved – the precarious tightrope walks, the death-defying motorcycle jumps, the sheer audacity of it all. Yet, he also saw the flicker of hope in Mrs. Cavendish's eyes, the desperate plea for reassurance that her son wouldn't become another statistic.
