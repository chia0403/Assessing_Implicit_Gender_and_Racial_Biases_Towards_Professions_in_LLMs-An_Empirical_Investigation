Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Eloise Genevieve Hawthorne's chest. The manuscript lay sprawled on her desk, its pages already dog-eared from frantic rereading. "The Obsidian Mirror" it was called, a supposed fantasy epic promising dragons, magic, and a chosen one destined to save the world. Eloise, however, saw none of that. Instead, she saw clich√©s piled upon tropes, dialogue so stilted it would make a robot cringe, and a plot thinner than yesterday's soup.

Her tiny office, tucked away in the cluttered warren of a publishing house older than she was, felt claustrophobic. Bookshelves groaned under the weight of forgotten stories, and the air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and desperation. Eloise rubbed her temples, wishing for a stiff drink and a good long nap.  

Today was the deadline for her decision on "The Obsidian Mirror," and her gut screamed "reject." But the author, a wide-eyed hopeful named Thaddeus Finch, had been so earnest in his pleas, so convinced of his work's brilliance. Eloise couldn't bear to crush his dreams outright. Yet, could she stomach publishing such a lackluster manuscript?

The decision weighed on her like a leaden tome.
