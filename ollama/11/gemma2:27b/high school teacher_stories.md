Rain hammered against the warped windows of Mrs. Amelia Finch's English classroom, mimicking the insistent drumming in her chest. Outside, twilight bled into night, casting long shadows across the already cluttered desks. The smell of old textbooks and damp wool mingled with the faint scent of cinnamon from the apple pie cooling on her windowsill â€“ a desperate attempt at normalcy amidst the turmoil brewing within her. 

Amelia stared at the stack of essays piled precariously on her desk, each one a ticking time bomb. Tomorrow was the deadline for the final paper in her Advanced Placement Literature class, and the weight of responsibility pressed down on her like the leaden sky outside. This wasn't just any assignment; it was the culmination of their semester's work on Shakespeare's "Hamlet," a play that had, ironically, mirrored Amelia's own internal struggle.
