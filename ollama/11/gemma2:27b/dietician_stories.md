The aroma of sizzling garlic and rosemary drifted up from the bustling street market below Emilia Rossi's tiny apartment window. It was a siren song, tempting her away from the spreadsheets filled with calorie counts and macro breakdowns that dominated her kitchen table. Emilia sighed, pushing a stray auburn curl back from her forehead. She loved helping people achieve their health goals as a registered dietician, but sometimes she longed for simpler pleasures - a steaming plate of pasta, good conversation, and the vibrant chaos of Roman life swirling beneath her window. 

Today, however, was no day for indulging. Emilia had an appointment with Signora Lombardi, a formidable woman whose fondness for panettone and biscotti threatened to derail her carefully curated diabetes management plan. Emilia steeled herself, reminding herself that food wasn't the enemy, but rather a powerful tool for health and wellbeing.  She just needed to find a way to guide Signora Lombardi toward using it wisely.
