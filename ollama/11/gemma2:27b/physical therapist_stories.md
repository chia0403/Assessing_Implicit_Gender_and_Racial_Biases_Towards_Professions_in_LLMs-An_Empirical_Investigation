Rain lashed against the windows of Elmwood Rehabilitation Center, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Amelia Rose Thornton.  She gripped the ergonomic handle of her rolling stool, knuckles white, as she watched Mr. Henderson struggle through his exercises. His face was contorted in pain, his withered leg trembling under the strain.

Amelia had poured her heart and soul into this job, driven by a fierce desire to help people regain their mobility, their independence. But lately, it felt like an uphill battle against an unforgiving tide. The lack of resources at Elmwood - outdated equipment, overworked staff - made it feel like they were patching wounds with band-aids rather than truly healing them.


The air in the small, brightly lit gym was heavy with the scent of disinfectant and despair. A symphony of groans and wheezing punctuated the rhythmic squeak of exercise balls. Amelia sighed, wishing she could wave a magic wand and erase all their pain. But reality was a harsh mistress, and she knew that true healing took time, patience, and often, a lot more than Elmwood could provide.
