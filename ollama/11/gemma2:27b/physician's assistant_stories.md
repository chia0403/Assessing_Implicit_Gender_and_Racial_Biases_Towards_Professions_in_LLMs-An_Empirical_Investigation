The acrid scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elara Josephine Vance. It mingled with the faint sweetness of jasmine from the window box outside, a stark contrast that always amused her.  Elara was used to the dichotomy - the sterile orderliness of Mercy General Hospital juxtaposed against the vibrant chaos of life unfolding just beyond its walls.

Elara checked her watch - 7:58 am. Dr. Chen would be arriving any minute now, and she could already picture his calm demeanor, the reassuring smile that always seemed to ease even the most panicked patient. But Elara couldn't shake a nagging sense of foreboding. Something was different today. The air thrummed with it.
