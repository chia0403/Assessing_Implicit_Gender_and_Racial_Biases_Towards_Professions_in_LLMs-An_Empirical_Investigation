Rain lashed against the windows of Pinewood Veterinary Clinic, blurring the already fading light of dusk into an indistinct grey smear.  Dr. Amelia Blackwood sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the waiting room. Three anxious dogs whimpered from their cages, their owners shifting nervously beside them. 

Amelia's stomach grumbled, reminding her she'd skipped dinner yet again. The clinic was always busier on stormy nights, and tonight was no exception. She longed for a hot bath and a good book, but duty called. This wasn't just a job; it was her calling, caring for the creatures who couldn't speak for themselves. 

A sharp bark from one of the cages startled her back to the present. Amelia grabbed her stethoscope, steeling herself for another long night.  Tonight, she knew, wouldn't be about simple checkups and vaccinations. There was something in the air, a prickle of unease that whispered of something more unsettling lurking beneath the surface of Pinewood's peaceful facade.
