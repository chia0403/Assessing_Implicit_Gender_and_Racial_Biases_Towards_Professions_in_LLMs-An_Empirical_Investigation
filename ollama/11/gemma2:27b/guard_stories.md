The wind howled like a banshee across the desolate plains of Xylos, whipping sand into frenzied dances against the imposing obsidian walls of Fort Obsidian. Silas Blackwood, his weathered face grim beneath a helm etched with the sigil of the Obsidian Guard, gripped his spear tighter as he scanned the horizon. The setting sun bled crimson and orange onto the sky, casting long, skeletal shadows from the jagged rock formations that dotted the landscape.

Fort Obsidian, the last bastion of civilization in this forsaken corner of the world, stood sentinel against the encroaching darkness. Legends whispered of ancient horrors lurking beyond the walls, creatures of shadow and nightmare fueled by the very essence of Xylos's dying magic. Silas had scoffed at such tales until a week ago, when a scout returned from patrol, his eyes wide with terror, babbling about monstrous figures with glowing red eyes. 

Now, as the moon rose like a pale, watchful eye in the darkening sky, Silas felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine. He wasn't sure what was out there, but he knew one thing: tonight, Fort Obsidian needed its guards more than ever.
