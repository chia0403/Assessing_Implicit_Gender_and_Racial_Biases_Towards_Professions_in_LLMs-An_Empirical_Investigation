The insistent chirp of Elodie Sinclair's phone dragged her from a dream filled with swirling paisley wallpaper and emerald velvet sofas. Groaning, she fumbled for the device on her bedside table, its screen illuminating her face in an ethereal glow. It was Mrs. Hawthorne again, no doubt about it. Elodie squinted at the caller ID – "The Hawthorne Estate" – and braced herself.

Elodie lived and breathed interiors. Her small but thriving business, "Sinclair Style," was built on a foundation of understanding spaces, uncovering their hidden potential, and transforming them into havens of beauty and functionality. But Mrs. Hawthorne, with her impossibly grand Victorian mansion perched precariously on the cliffs overlooking the stormy Cornish coast, tested even Elodie's boundless patience. The woman seemed incapable of making a decision, constantly changing her mind about fabrics, furniture styles, and even the color of the damn paint.

Elodie took a deep breath, channeling her inner Zen master before answering. "Good morning, Mrs. Hawthorne. How can I be of service?"
