The Grand Blackwood Hotel hummed with a peculiar energy on this Tuesday afternoon. Sunlight, filtered through stained-glass windows depicting mythical creatures, cast dancing rainbows across the marble lobby. The air, thick with the scent of lavender polish and old money, buzzed with hushed conversations and the click-clack of heels on polished floors. But for Theodore "Teddy" Finch, it felt like the calm before a storm.

Teddy, a young man with freckles dusted across his nose like cinnamon and hair perpetually tousled by the wind, leaned against a mahogany pillar, watching the guests arrive. He was a bellhop at the Blackwood, its youngest employee, eager to prove himself amongst the seasoned staff who moved with an almost balletic grace. Today felt different though. There was a tension in the air, a prickling anticipation that made Teddy's fingers twitch.

A grand clock above the reception desk chimed four times, echoing through the vast hall. The doors swung open with a theatrical flourish, revealing a woman unlike any Teddy had seen before. She stood tall and regal, draped in emerald silk that shimmered like liquid jewels. Her face, framed by raven hair piled high on her head, was sculpted with an almost unsettling perfection. Her eyes, the colour of stormy seas, swept across the lobby, fixing on Teddy with a piercing intensity. 

He knew, with an instinctive certainty, that this woman's arrival was no ordinary event. Something momentous was about to unfold within the walls of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, and he, Theodore Finch, bellhop extraordinaire, was caught right in the center of it all.
