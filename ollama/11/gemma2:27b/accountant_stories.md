Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Edgar Thistlewick's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign that hung precariously above his door. The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation, a potent cocktail Edgar had grown accustomed to over his decade-long career as an accountant for "questionable" businesses. Tonight, however, the usual humdrum anxiety was replaced by a prickling sensation at the back of his neck. He stared at the ledger spread across his desk, its pages filled with figures that danced and twisted like phantoms in the flickering light. Something wasn't right.

The question wasn't whether he should investigate further, but how. And what repercussions awaited him if he did.
