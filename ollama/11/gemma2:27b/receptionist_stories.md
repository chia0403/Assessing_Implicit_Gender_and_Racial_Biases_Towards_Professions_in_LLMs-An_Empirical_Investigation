Rain hammered against the glass doors of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, blurring the city lights into an Impressionist painting. Evelyn Rose Hawthorne sighed, idly tracing patterns on the mahogany reception desk with her fingertip. The storm had been raging for hours, keeping most guests indoors and deterring any new arrivals.  

Evelyn, despite being surrounded by the opulent décor - plush velvet armchairs, a roaring fireplace beneath a gilded mirror, and crystal chandeliers casting shimmering light – felt a creeping sense of claustrophobia. She longed for the crisp autumn air, the crunch of leaves under her boots, anything but the stuffy silence broken only by the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.

Tonight, she was alone. Mr. Henderson, the gruff night manager, had been called away to deal with a plumbing emergency at one of the older wings. Evelyn usually relished the quietude, a chance to catch up on her reading or listen to podcasts without interruption. But tonight, something felt different, a prickling sensation at the back of her neck that whispered of unseen eyes and unspoken secrets lurking in the shadows of the Grand Blackwood.
