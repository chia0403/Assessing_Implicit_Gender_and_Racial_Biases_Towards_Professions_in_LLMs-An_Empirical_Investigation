Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Nail, each drop echoing like a tiny hammer blow in the near-empty bar.  The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap whiskey, and regret – a potent cocktail Silas Blackwood, the bartender, had become intimately acquainted with over his ten years behind the counter. 

Silas ran a calloused hand through his perpetually tousled dark hair, eyeing the solitary figure slumped at the far end of the bar.  A woman, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, nursed a glass of amber liquid, staring listlessly into its depths.  She was new – Silas hadn't seen her before in this dimly lit haven for lost souls and broken dreams.  Something about the way she held herself, a tightly coiled tension beneath her worn leather jacket, piqued his curiosity.

Tonight, the city outside seemed to mirror the mood inside The Rusty Nail: dark, brooding, and restless.   Silas sighed, bracing himself for another long night of pouring drinks and listening to woes he couldn't possibly solve.  But as the woman finally lifted her gaze, meeting Silas's with eyes the color of stormy seas, he knew this night was going to be different.
