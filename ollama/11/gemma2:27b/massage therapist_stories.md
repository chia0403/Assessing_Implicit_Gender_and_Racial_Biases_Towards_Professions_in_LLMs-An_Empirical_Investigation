Rain lashed against the windows of "Harmony Hands," blurring the neon "Open" sign into an impressionistic smear. Inside, Elara Ainsworth kneaded tension out of Mr. Henderson's shoulders, her fingers finding the knots like a cartographer charting hidden valleys. The aroma of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, momentarily masking the faint scent of damp wool that clung to Mr. Henderson's tweed jacket.

Elara usually found solace in the rhythmic strokes and quiet murmur of her clients' breathing. But tonight, an uneasy feeling gnawed at her. It had started with a cryptic message left on her answering machine earlier that day: "They know what you saw. Don't trust anyone."  The voice was distorted, barely audible over the static. 

She dismissed it as a prank call at first. But the words lingered in her mind like a persistent echo, unsettling the serenity she cultivated in her practice. Now, with Mr. Henderson snoring softly beneath her hands, Elara couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right.  The rain continued its relentless assault outside, mirroring the storm brewing within her.
