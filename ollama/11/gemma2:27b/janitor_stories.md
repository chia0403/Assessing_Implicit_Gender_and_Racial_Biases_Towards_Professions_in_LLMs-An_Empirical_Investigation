The fluorescent hum of the school hallways was Elias Finch's nightly symphony. He pushed his battered mop bucket down the deserted corridor, its metal squealing like a mournful cat. The flickering lights painted long shadows that stretched and danced with him, making the empty lockers seem like watchful eyes. Elias preferred it this way – quiet, solitary. The cacophony of children during school hours was enough to make anyone crave silence. 

He paused by the art room door, inhaling the lingering scent of turpentine and acrylics. A splash of vivid green paint still adorned the worn floorboards, a testament to someone's artistic zeal (or perhaps carelessness). Elias chuckled softly, remembering his own youthful attempts at capturing beauty on canvas.

Tonight, however, his thoughts weren't on art. They were on the crumpled note tucked inside his pocket, a message that had thrown his normally predictable world into disarray. It was an invitation – a cryptic one – to meet someone in the school library after midnight. The sender? Unknown.
