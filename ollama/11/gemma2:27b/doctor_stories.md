He meticulously examined a sample of blood, a crimson smear against the pale glass slide. A cold dread gnawed at him â€“ this wasn't a common ailment. The peculiar discoloration and the unsettling viscosity hinted at something far more sinister than he'd ever encountered before.

A sudden rap on the door startled him. He hastily covered the microscope, his heart pounding in his chest. He knew who it was.
