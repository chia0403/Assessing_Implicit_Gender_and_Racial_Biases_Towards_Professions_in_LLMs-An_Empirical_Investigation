The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and rosemary.  A fine mist clung to the cobblestone streets outside, blurring the gaslights into hazy orbs. Inside the shop, however, the air was crisp, carrying the tang of salt pork and smoked ham. Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw surveyed his domain – Grimshaw's Meats – with a practiced eye. Rows of plump sausages gleamed under the hanging lamps, glistening hunks of beef lay nestled on beds of crushed ice, and feathered chickens hung upside down, their lifeless eyes staring into eternity. 

Barty, a man built like an ox with hands calloused from years of cleaving bone and trimming fat, wiped the sweat from his brow with a bloodstained apron.  He'd been up since dawn, preparing for the day's onslaught. Today was market day, the busiest day of the week in the quaint village of Oakhaven. The townsfolk would be clamouring for his finest cuts, his spiced sausages, and his legendary black pudding.
