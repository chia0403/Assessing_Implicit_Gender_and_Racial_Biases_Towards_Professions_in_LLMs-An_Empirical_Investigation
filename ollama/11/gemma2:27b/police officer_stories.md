Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, each drop echoing like a gunshot in the cavernous space. Detective Alistair "Mac" McMillan gripped his flashlight tighter, its beam cutting through the gloom, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. The scent of mildew and something acrid, metallic, hung heavy. He'd seen enough crime scenes to know that smell - blood.

Mac waded cautiously through a maze of rusted machinery and discarded crates, each step sending a shiver up his spine. The warehouse was located on the outskirts of Glasgow, a forgotten relic in a city steeped in history and shadowed by its industrial past. This wasn't the first time he'd been called to this godforsaken corner of town, but the feeling of unease clung to him with an unnerving persistence.
