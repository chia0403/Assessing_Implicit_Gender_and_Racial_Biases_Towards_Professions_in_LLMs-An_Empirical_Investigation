Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Eloise Ainsworth's heart.  The ancient building, its towering shelves crammed with leather-bound volumes and the scent of aged paper thick in the air, usually offered solace. Tonight, however, it felt more like a tomb. The grandfather clock in the corner chimed midnight, each resonant clang echoing her mounting dread. 

Eloise clutched the brittle scroll tighter, its faded ink whispering secrets from a forgotten age. It detailed a hidden chamber, accessible only on nights when the moon aligned with the library's gargoyle statue, casting a specific shadow upon the floor. Eloise had scoffed at the notion when she first discovered it tucked away in a dusty tome â€“  until tonight, when the impossible alignment coincided with her own desperate need for answers.
