The air in "Rosie's Diner" hung thick with the scent of frying onions and stale coffee, a familiar perfume to Elara Jean Beaumont. Her worn-out sneakers squeaked on the checkered linoleum floor as she weaved between tables piled high with greasy plates and forgotten ketchup packets.  Elara's blonde ponytail bounced in time with the old jukebox crooning "Hound Dog", a stark contrast to the weary slump of her shoulders. Another Tuesday night, another endless parade of hungry truckers, lonely retirees, and college kids on a caffeine bender. 

But tonight felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced along Elara's skin, a sensation she hadn't felt since... well, since before Rosie's Diner became her only world.  She glanced at the clock above the counter â€“ 8:42 pm. He was late.
