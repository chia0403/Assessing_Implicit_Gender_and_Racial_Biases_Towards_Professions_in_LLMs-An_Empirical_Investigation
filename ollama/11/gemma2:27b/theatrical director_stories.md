Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Grand Majestic Theatre, mirroring the tempest brewing inside Beatrice Ophelia Hawthorne's chest.  The once opulent theatre, now faded and smelling faintly of dust and mothballs, creaked under the onslaught, its groaning timbers echoing her own mounting despair.  Beatrice, a woman whose fiery red hair matched her equally passionate temperament, paced the worn wooden stage, clutching a crumpled script in her hand.

Tonight was opening night for "The Tempest," Beatrice's ambitious attempt to breathe new life into this decaying relic of a theatre. But with half the cast down with flu and the lead actor threatening to walk out due to "artistic differences," Beatrice felt like she was steering a ship headed straight for a jagged, theatrical iceberg.

As thunder rattled the building, Beatrice stopped pacing and stared up at the dusty chandelier, its once-sparkling crystals now dulled and cobwebbed.  Could she pull this off? Could she defy the odds stacked against her and deliver a performance worthy of The Tempest's magic? The answer, whispered by the wind howling outside, seemed as elusive as ever.
