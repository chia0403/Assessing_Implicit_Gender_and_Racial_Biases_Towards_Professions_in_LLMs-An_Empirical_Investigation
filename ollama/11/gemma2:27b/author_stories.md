Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the glass. Eleanor Ainsworth sighed, her gaze drifting from the manuscript sprawled across her desk to the grey sky beyond. London was shrouded in a perpetual drizzle this time of year, a fitting backdrop for the gothic novel she was struggling to finish. The cramped attic room, with its slanted ceiling and dusty beams, felt more like a forgotten tomb than a writer's sanctuary.

Eleanor pushed a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and picked up her pen. The words wouldn't come. Perhaps it was the oppressive weather, or maybe she was simply burnt out. This novel, "The Whispering Walls," had been haunting her for months, its shadows stretching long into her waking life. But tonight, the whispers felt louder than usual, insistent and unsettling. 

Just then, a sudden thud from the floor below jolted her upright. Eleanor's heart pounded in her chest. She lived alone in this rambling old house inherited from her eccentric aunt, and it was rarely disturbed by anything more exciting than the scurrying of mice. This sound, however, was different: heavy, deliberate, almostâ€¦human.
