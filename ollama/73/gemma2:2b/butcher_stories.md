The air hung thick with the scent of smoke, sawdust, and old blood.  Sweat beaded on Elias "Ironhand" Thorne's brow as he surveyed the mountain of carcasses in his small-town butcher shop. The midday sun was already dipping behind the towering pines that surrounded Oakhaven, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. A gust of wind whistled through the open window, carrying with it the aroma of pine needles and a hint of autumn's earthy tang. It was the smell of life and death all at once, the very essence of what Ironhand did for a living - his craft.

His hands, strong as oak beams and scarred with years of wielding meat cleavers and hooks, moved with practiced ease.  He had grown weary of the routine, but he felt an inexplicable loyalty to this life. Oakhaven was where he belonged. This little town, nestled amidst the sprawling woods and bordered by a rushing river, held a familiar comfort that no other place could replicate. 

But tonight, something hung in the air - an unease Elias couldn't ignore. His eyes, usually sharp as flint, softened with concern as he looked at the butcher paper-covered carcass of a young steer. It had been his own son, Calebâ€™s, first steer. And Caleb was due to return home for dinner.
