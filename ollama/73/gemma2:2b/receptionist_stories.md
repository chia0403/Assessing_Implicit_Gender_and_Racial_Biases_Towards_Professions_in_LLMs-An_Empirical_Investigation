Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane in the cramped reception area, blurring the bustling city street into an indistinct watercolour smear.  A lone figure, Amelia Thorne, hunched over a overflowing phone stack, attempting to disentangle herself from the tangled mess of calls. "Hold on just a moment," she muttered to the next caller on her list – Mr. Fitzwilliam’s secretary was due in at 9:02 am sharp for the very important meeting with the Mayor.  "Mr. Fitzwilliam will be furious if I'm late," Amelia thought, her voice laced with anxiety as she struggled to find the right phone number on a stack of paper that seemed to defy gravity itself.

Amelia’s world had always revolved around a precise clock, each tick and tock an anchor in the storm of the city life.  As receptionist for the prestigious firm of Thornhill & Co., her days were predictable: calls, faxes, emails – all meticulously timed and ordered.   The old stone building, with its towering oak door and worn leather armchair, was Amelia's own personal time capsule, a comforting echo of a simpler, less chaotic life she yearned for.  Yet, as the city outside raged on, the silence within the office seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something to break free.
