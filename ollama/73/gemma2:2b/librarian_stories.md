Rain lashed against the library windows, turning the world outside into a blur of charcoal grey and silver streaks of light. Inside, the old stone building, with its creaking floorboards and scent of aged paper, hummed with quiet life.  Ms. Agnes Nightingale, her silver hair pulled back in a tight bun that framed a weathered face, sat behind the towering stacks of Dewey Decimal System books, her hands tracing the spine of a worn copy of Jane Eyre.

Agnes had been at the helm of the Blackwood Library for twenty-five years, witnessing generations pass through its doors.  She'd seen love blossom amidst whispered tales in the book alcoves and witnessed heartbreak unfold on lonely library chairs. She knew the library's heart: a sturdy oak table, where she spent countless hours surrounded by stacks of dusty tomes, its worn surface mirroring the creases on her own brow. 

Tonight, however, Agnes felt an unsettling weight in her chest, something akin to a stray dog sniffing for trouble in the quiet storm.  The silence was broken by the distinct clink and clatter outside - a sound that sent a shiver down her spine. Was it just the wind, or was there a deeper discordance, a note of unease in the symphony of the rain?
