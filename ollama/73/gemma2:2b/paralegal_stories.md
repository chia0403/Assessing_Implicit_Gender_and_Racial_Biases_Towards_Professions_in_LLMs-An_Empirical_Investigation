Rain hammered against the windows of The Law Offices of Theodore Finch, drumming out a frantic rhythm that mirrored the anxiety building in Amelia "Amy" Bellweather's chest. Outside, the storm raged like an angry god, mirroring the tempestuous battle she was fighting inside her own skull. 

Her heart pounded in her ears as she hunched over Mr. Finch's meticulously organized desk, the familiar scent of old leather and cedarwood filling her lungs. The case before her, a seemingly straightforward assault lawsuit against a local restaurant owner, had become tangled in a web of secrets, lies, and unspoken truths that threatened to unravel everything Amy worked for. She was no stranger to working with troubled clients and navigating complex legal battles –  after all, she was Mr. Finch's prized paralegal. Yet, this case felt different, as though the weight of it hung like a shroud over her very being. 

It wasn’t just the accusations of assault. The client, Mrs. Dubois, a woman who had once held power within the city council, now seemed to be unraveling under pressure from an anonymous source.  Her own investigations into Mrs. Dubois’s past were leading to dead ends, but Amy knew that something was off. A sense of unease settled in her stomach as she pieced together fragments of information: a veiled threat, whispered conversations at the local coffee shop, and a series of seemingly unconnected events culminating in the assault accusation itself. 

Amy stared out at the storm’s fury, knowing that the answer to this case was closer than she thought, but that answer held more danger than any of Mr. Finch's legal battles had presented before.
