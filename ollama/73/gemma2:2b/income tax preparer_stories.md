Rain hammered against the windows of Evelyn “Eve” Thorne’s office like tiny fists pounding on a steel drum. The air inside hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and last week's anxieties -  a potent brew she couldn’t quite shake off. Eve, her normally vibrant blonde bob pulled back tight into a bun, sighed as she stared at a stack of tax returns taller than her filing cabinet. Each one felt like another year slipping through her fingers, each number another knot in the intricate web of someone else's life.  This was 2038, and Eve’s corner office in the heart of bustling New York City was still as antiquated as a rotary phone, yet she navigated it with a confidence born from years of meticulous practice. It wasn't just about numbers; it was about understanding the lives behind them.

Eve was used to dealing with the complexities of American tax law, but today felt different. Today felt like the storm clouds were not merely gathering outside her office window – they were swirling in and around the very souls she was tasked with navigating.  And there was something else, a subtle shift in the atmosphere that made the air itself seem heavier than usual - a feeling of foreboding Eve couldn't quite shake off.
