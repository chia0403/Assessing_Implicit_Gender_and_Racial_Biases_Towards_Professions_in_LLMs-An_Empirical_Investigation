The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windowpane, throwing long, dancing shadows across Dr. Amelia Croft's cluttered office. A faint aroma of antiseptic mingled with the musky scent of cedarwood, a fragrance she had always found strangely comforting after years spent immersed in animal lives and their inevitable sorrows. It wasn't unusual for her to be here past the official end of the workday, as this quaint clinic nestled at the edge of the sprawling Redwood National Park often found itself overrun with unexpected emergencies—and Amelia was never one to shy away from an adventure on four legs (or occasionally two). 

Her phone buzzed, a frantic chirping interrupting her reverie. The call was from Mr. Peterson, the gruff but undeniably sweet owner of the local ranch, his voice crackling with anxiety over the line. "Amelia," he'd rasped, urgency clinging to each syllable, "We got ourselves a real mess." 
 
He wasn't talking about the usual scrapes and lacerations that plagued her animal patients. No, this time it was something far more ominous – an injured young colt, trapped in a thicket of thorny bramble with no clear way out. Amelia took a deep breath, knowing that as she walked into the heart of the Redwood forest for another "regular" call, reality would become anything but ordinary.
