Rain lashed against the worn asphalt of I-80 like an army of tiny hammers, each blow echoing the growing frustration in Elias Thorne's stomach.  He pulled his heavy coat tighter, seeking meager comfort against the biting wind that whipped off the plains and into his weary bones. His hands, already numb despite multiple layers of work gloves, tightened around the wrench he held, its familiar weight a small solace amidst the vast emptiness that stretched out in front of him. 

Elias was a Highwayman, a title earned through years of sweat, grit, and endless stretches of asphalt under the merciless glare of the sun. It wasnâ€™t glamourous work; it was dirty work, but Elias held his head high, his calloused hands building the lifeblood that powered this country's vast network of roads. 

He surveyed his crew - a motley bunch of men, each with stories etched in their tired eyes and creased faces, all sharing a silent kinship born out of the daily grind.  A symphony of clanking metal, roaring engines, and muttered curses filled the air as they worked. The only sound louder than the rain was the low hum of anxiety in Elias's chest, the weight of an upcoming storm far greater than the one battering them from above. 

The rumble of a distant truck, loaded with supplies for the next construction project on their stretch of I-80, jolted him out of his thoughts.  He glanced at the sky again, its grey canvas mirroring the churning within him. The weather had been erratic lately, a constant reminder of the forces beyond their control, and the storm brewing tonight promised to be more than just rain.
