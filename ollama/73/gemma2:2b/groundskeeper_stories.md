The wind howled through the skeletal branches of oaks and maples, their gnarled limbs scraping against the storm-battered roof of Thornbrook manor. Rain lashed down, a torrent that seemed determined to carve a path for itself through the overgrown gardens bordering the estate. It was this very storm that had unleashed its fury on Elias Thorne, groundskeeper extraordinaire, as he battled his way across the treacherous lawn in soaked boots and an even wetter coat.

He wasn't used to working in such conditions. Usually, his days were spent tending the rose bushes with their velvety petals and smelling of sun-kissed earth, or coaxing life from the stubborn wildflowers that refused to cooperate. But this storm was different – it was a primal force unleashed upon the land. It was like the very ground itself was crying out for mercy. 

Elias's eyes scanned the rain-lashed landscape, searching for any sign of a breach in his carefully maintained order. He knew, though, that the storm wasn’t the only thing stirring in Thornbrook manor tonight. There were whispers in the twilight, of shadows dancing on the ancient stone walls, and hushed voices carried away by the wind. Tonight was no ordinary night.
