The late August sun beat down on Ethan's neck like an angry hammer, driving sweat to his temples even as he worked at a staggering pace. Dust clung to his worn, brown jumpsuit as he hauled another steel beam into place for the new apartment complex, "Veritas Flats". The concrete jungle was already growing around him, swallowing up the sun and shadows in a haze of construction noise.  Ethan wasn't just putting walls together; he was shaping lives.

The city had been his canvas since he graduated high school, painting it with grit, sweat, and the occasional sunrise. His hands moved like they belonged to an artist, familiar lines etching themselves into steel, timber, and mortar. He saw in every brick laid, every beam set, a thread of something bigger than himself – the promise of comfort, of community, of finally calling somewhere home after years on the road.  Ethan wasn't just building houses; he was constructing dreams. 

His name echoed in the whirring machinery, "Ethan Callahan" a quiet, hardworking moniker that blended seamlessly with his rough hands and stoic gaze. This life was all he knew. But tonight, as the city lights started to paint the sky with their own palette of colour, Ethan couldn't shake off a feeling of unease. It wasn’t just the weight of another day done; it was something deeper, something that lingered in his gut like a storm cloud on the horizon.
