## The Velvet Glove

**Setting:** 1920s Paris, amidst the glittering glamour of the Belle Époque.

**Main Character:**  Marcel Dubois - A quiet man with sharp eyes and even sharper wit. His twenty years in this elegant Parisian hotel have taught him to navigate the labyrinthine hallways and social minefields of the city's elite with ease. He prefers the company of a well-worn book and a glass of wine to the raucous crowds that throng the city streets, yet his smile and soft voice can disarm even the most imposing guests. 

**Opening:**

The scent of fresh violets wafted down from the third floor where the famed Madame Dubois hosted her afternoon tea for prominent Parisian society. Marcel, perched on a worn leather armchair beside the fireplace, watched the symphony of activity unfold with detached amusement. A delicate woman in a beaded flapper dress flitted between two startled men as she tried to find a conversation partner, the clink of silverware jarring against the hushed whispers of gossip and speculation. 

A heavy door creaked open behind him, revealing a figure shrouded in shadows. "Marcel," the voice was deep and gravelly, a low growl that sent shivers down his spine. It belonged to Monsieur Moreau, the owner of the hotel and a man whose face was as sharp and unforgiving as the angles of a Parisian cathedral.  "You have received a request."

The words hung in the air like smoke from a roaring fireplace, leaving Marcel with an unsettling premonition. "A request?" he echoed, his voice a murmur barely audible above the crackling fire.

* Does Marcel find himself drawn into a web of intrigue and mystery surrounding Monsieur Moreau’s request?
* How does his personality – quiet, observant, and seemingly detached – make him the ideal person to handle this situation? 
* Is there danger brewing in the shadows of Paris' glamorous facade?
