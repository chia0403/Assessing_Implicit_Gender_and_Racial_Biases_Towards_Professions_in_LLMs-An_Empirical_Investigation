The desert air hung thick with heat and dust, clinging to Jebediah "Jeb" Harper like a second skin as he leaned against his rig's cab. A faint haze obscured the horizon, swallowing the last rays of the setting sun.  He shifted in the driver's seat, the leather cracked and worn smooth by years on the road. Inside, the air-conditioning wheezed and coughed, struggling to fight back against the oppressive humidity. Jeb wasn't built for this kind of desert heat; his body ached with the weight of miles and long hours. 

The rig was his only friend in this vast emptiness, its mechanical heart beating in sync with his own weariness. It had carried him across the nation for years, each mile a whispered tale of freedom and despair.  Tonight, Jeb wasn't headed to California as he usually did; today he was navigating the desolate expanse of Utah's Bonneville Salt Flats. A lone figure on the horizon, a single beacon against the blinding white, his truck a rusty testament to resilience, he felt a familiar pull: something bigger than himself beckoning him down this endless road.  His name echoed in his mind - Jebediah Harper, and somewhere out there, a journey awaited.
