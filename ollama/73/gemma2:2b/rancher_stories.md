##  Dust Devil's Dance

**Setting:** The dusty plains of Montana stretched out before Ethan Callahan’s weathered face like an unforgiving canvas.  Barren cactuses poked through parched soil, and the wind whipped sand into his eyes, teasing him with promises of a storm that never came. 

The ranch, aptly named "Callahan's Comet," was a testament to grit and resilience, its worn wooden fences creaking like an old man's knees under the unrelenting sun.  Ethan's hands, calloused and strong as they were, moved with practiced ease as he surveyed his cattle, their silhouettes stark against the unforgiving backdrop of endless sky. 

This land had been his family’s for generations, a constant presence in a life shaped by its rhythm – sunrise, sunset, rain, drought. But lately, it felt like that rhythm was faltering, replaced by an unsettling dissonance. The cattle were thinning, and the waterhole on the northern edge of the range was drying up faster than he'd ever seen. It felt as if the earth itself was groaning beneath him, a silent plea for help. 


**Character:**  Ethan Callahan. A man weathered by years under Montana’s relentless sun, with eyes that mirrored his rugged terrain – deep and insightful but scarred from too many hardships endured and battles fought. At 52, he carried himself with an unspoken strength, though there was a weariness in his gaze that hinted at the encroaching shadows of time.  Ethan wasn't just a rancher; he was a guardian, his lineage woven into the very fabric of this land. He knew its stories, loved it fiercely despite the growing fear for its future.
