The humid air hung thick as molasses in the small Florida town of Cypress Bend.  Even at sunset, the heat clung to the old Victorian-style building where Amelia "Amy" Carter's office resided. The faded floral wallpaper seemed to groan under the weight of decades; it would be a shame to paint over the history of this place, Amy thought wryly as she stared out the cracked window at the palm trees swaying in the breeze. 

Her name, like the town itself, was a whisper from a different time.  Amy had inherited her late father's insurance agency after he succumbed to the same heat stroke that had taken down countless Cypress Bend residents over the years. The building felt heavy with his presence, and while Amy yearned for it to be a beacon of progress in the sleepy town, she also found solace in its faded grandeur. 

The phone on her desk buzzed, a jarring interruption to her contemplation.  It was Mr. Peterson, an old retired fisherman who always seemed agitated about his life insurance policy.  "Amy," he slurred, "I've... I've lost it." The line went dead, leaving Amy staring at the rotary dial with a weary smile. Another day in Cypress Bend.
