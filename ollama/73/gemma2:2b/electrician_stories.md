The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of burnt motor oil as Felix "Flick" Thorne squinted at the flickering neon sign above the garage door.  He'd been called in to fix this place - The Blue Rooster - just after midnight, because a rogue bolt on the exterior wiring had sparked a rather dramatic incident involving a runaway chicken and an unfortunate poodle that wasn't quite as graceful as it looked. 

Flick's worn leather work boots kicked up dust as he made his way across the cracked asphalt parking lot. The rusty sign above creaked slightly with each step, its faded blue paint barely contrasting against the dim street lights of the sleepy town of Oakhaven. It was a place where time seemed to hold its breath, and even the wind seemed to sigh in measured tones.  Flick wasn't quite from this place - he'd come here after years chasing lightning rods and power outages across the country, but lately, the quiet solitude of this little town had started to feel like home. 

He adjusted his thick-rimmed glasses and pulled out his toolkit, a collection of metal and wire that seemed to hum with silent stories of past repairs and forgotten troubles.  It was going to be another long night at The Blue Rooster.
