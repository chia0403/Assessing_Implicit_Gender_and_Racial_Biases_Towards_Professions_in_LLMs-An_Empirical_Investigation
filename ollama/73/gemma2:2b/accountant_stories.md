Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Mr. Alistair Thornhill's office, blurring the neon glow of the '24-Hour Accounting' sign outside into an abstract watercolor splatter. Inside, Alistair himself was trapped in a storm of his own making: mountains of invoices stacked precariously on the desk, each number screaming its own silent indictment against him. His fingers, usually nimble and precise, now trembled as he tried to add up the latest batch of discrepancies â€“ a symphony of errors that echoed the turmoil brewing inside him. 

Mr. Thornhill was not a man of chaos, but even his rigid routine had begun to unravel like an unspooled thread.  He'd been chasing ghosts for weeks now: missing checks, phantom deposits, and an unsettling feeling of being watched. His meticulously organized world was crumbling like stale biscuits, threatening to swallow him whole. 

Alistair sighed, the sound echoing through the sterile office as a lone raindrop splattered against his windowpane. He looked out at the city, its neon glow reflecting off the storm clouds - the same storm that mirrored the one raging within. Tonight, he felt the weight of an unsettling secret heavier than any stack of bills.
