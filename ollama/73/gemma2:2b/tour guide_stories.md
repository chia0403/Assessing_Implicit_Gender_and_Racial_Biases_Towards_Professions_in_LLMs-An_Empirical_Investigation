## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  The cobblestone streets of Prague's Old Town Square wind past ancient buildings adorned with colorful stained glass windows.  Staring out onto the square, you can almost feel the weight of centuries in this vibrant, bustling city. Above you, a gothic sky looms; the sun sinking beneath the peaks of the Charles Bridge, casting long shadows that dance on the worn stone paths.

**Character:** Elara Thorne is young and vivacious.  Her brown hair is usually pulled back tight, escaping into unruly waves at the edges of her bright, green eyes.  With a quick wit and infectious energy, she's been guiding tours for two years now. Elara loves sharing Prague's magic with visitors, especially those who come from places like California or Scotland where even the air seems thick with an undercurrent of history. She wears a faded leather satchel slung across her shoulder, filled with pamphlets and historical tidbits. 

**Opening:**

"Alright folks," Elara announced, stepping into the bustling crowd at the foot of the Old Town Hall.  A few tourists had gathered, their eyes wide with anticipation as they looked up at the imposing building's facade. "Ready to delve into the heart of Prague's magic? Today's tour focuses on the whispers of the past." 

She took a deep breath, a mischievous glint in her eyes.  "We'll hear secrets about its most famous resident, the notorious alchemist Dr. Franz Kafka..."  Elara paused for dramatic effect.  The tourists murmured and shifted nervously. "Or maybe," she added with a wink, "we'll delve deeper into the stories of the hidden spirits that linger in these very walls."


She launched into an enthusiastic recounting of Prague's history, her voice rising above the bustling crowd. The story began to unfold - weaving through time and place as Elara painted vivid pictures of intrigue and secrets. A smile touched her lips as she watched the tourists' faces become filled with wonder. This was her passion, her gift: to make history come alive for those who didn't know where their own ancestors might have walked a thousand years ago.
