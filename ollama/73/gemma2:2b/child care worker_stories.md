The scent of cinnamon and sugar hung heavy in the air, thick as fog after a winter storm. It was one of Ms. Amelia Hawthorne's favorites - Mrs. Peabody's annual Gingerbread House Competition.  A whirlwind of frosting and sprinkles, chaos reigned in Amelia’s care center on Tuesdays, where the aroma was the least of her worries.  Today, however, the air itself seemed heavy with an unspoken tension. A storm was brewing not just outside, but within the walls of the cozy building.

Amelia, at 27 years old, looked weary and a little lost in a sea of sticky fingers and giggles. Her heart felt as heavy as the giant gingerbread house looming on the table – Mrs. Peabody's masterpiece, towering with intricate detail. It was meant to inspire the children, but Amelia wasn’t sure it could do much for her own soul. This month had been marked by an unsettling shift: a new family joining the center, with their teenage daughter who seemed as distant and reserved as a polar bear on the shores of a snowy fjord. And then there were rumors of an upcoming school fundraising event that was turning into a battleground between Mrs. Peabody’s gingerbread house ambitions and Mr. Henderson's penchant for theatrics.  

It was a Tuesday, after all, the day when even the most seasoned care workers began to wonder if they could weather another storm.
