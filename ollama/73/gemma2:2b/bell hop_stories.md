## Setting:

The Grand Majestic Hotel. A behemoth of Art Deco grandeur in the heart of New York City. Gleaming marble staircases wind between floors, the aroma of freshly-baked pastries drifts from the lobby, and live jazz music sets the mood for an afternoon where time seems to stand still. 


## Character:

**Elias Thorne,** a young man with sharp cheekbones and eyes that seem to hold a thousand city stories within them.  He's got the effortless charm of a vintage Hollywood actor - but with a work ethic that would put him at the top of any list of "reliable." Elias is not one for fuss or fancy, preferring the comfort of his worn-out leather shoes and the smell of pipe tobacco in the cramped back office.

**Story Opening:**

The Grand Majestic Hotel was an oasis in a city that never seemed to sleep. Even as the first rays of dawn bled over the Manhattan skyline, Elias Thorne was already on his feet. He'd clocked in before the sun truly rose, a tradition he clung to even in this fast-paced, demanding city. 

Elias worked as a bell hop at the Grand Majestic, tasked with ushering in every weary traveler and ensuring they felt welcome within its gilded walls. But today, something felt different. A hush fell over the lobby, broken only by the soft hiss of champagne flutes being passed through silver trays. It was the arrival of Mr. Winthrop Thorne. 

Mr. Thorne, a wealthy industrialist with eyes that held the weight of untold empires, looked like he'd been through a storm. Elias felt a surge of empathy for the man - his quiet desperation radiating from him like an invisible current.  It was as if this city, built on dreams and ambition, had finally ground down even Mr. Thorne, leaving him weary and adrift.


**What will happen to Elias? How does he interact with Mr. Thorne? What secrets lie behind the grand facade of the Grand Majestic?**
