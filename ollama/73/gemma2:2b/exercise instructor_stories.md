## Story Opening

Rain lashed against the gymnasium windows, blurring the street lights into swirling ghosts beyond. Inside, the air hung thick with sweat and exertion.  A low hum of panting and muttered affirmations rose above the steady thump-thump of a heart monitor.  Amelia "Amy" Thorne, her dark auburn hair escaping its ponytail as she spoke, adjusted a headband on her brow to check her reflection in the polished steel water bottles lining the walls. Her gaze landed on a younger man struggling with each rep, his face contorted in frustrated effort. 

**Setting:** The Oasis Fitness Studio - a sprawling gymnasium nestled amidst bustling city streets.  Its once-bright facade is now faded and weathered, hinting at the passage of time and countless sweat sessions lost to the relentless grip of urban life.
