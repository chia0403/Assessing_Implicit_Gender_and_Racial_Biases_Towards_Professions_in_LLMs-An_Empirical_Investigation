The wind whipped Professor Eleanor Thorne's auburn hair around her face as she stepped onto the stone balcony.  Below her, the cobbled streets of Prague hummed with an early evening life – the gentle clatter of carriage wheels, the vibrant chatter of vendors hawking fresh sausages, and the melodic strains of a street musician's fiddle.  Yet, Eleanor found herself lost in thought, her eyes fixed on the ancient castle looming above the city's central square. 

It was a structure steeped in history, its towering stone walls adorned with intricate gargoyles that seemed to watch over the city's secrets. It was also where she had been stationed for the past year – ever since she had taken the helm of Prague University’s renowned department of Ancient Languages and Folklore.  Now, as she faced the imposing gateway, a heavy sense of foreboding settled upon her like a shroud. 

For tonight was the opening night of the annual Festival of Legends, an event dedicated to celebrating the city's rich history and folklore – events that were always steeped in intrigue and often overshadowed by unsettling tales whispered within the halls of the university.  Eleanor, with her sharp intellect and unwavering curiosity, knew there was more than just entertainment at play tonight. This was a night where the veil between reality and legend began to thin, and the stories of Prague's past bled into the present.
