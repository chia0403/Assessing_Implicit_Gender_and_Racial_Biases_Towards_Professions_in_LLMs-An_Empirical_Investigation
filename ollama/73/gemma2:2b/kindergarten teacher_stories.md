The aroma of crayons and freshly sharpened pencils hung thick in the air as Mrs. Eleanor Hawthorne meticulously arranged the brightly-colored alphabet blocks on the center stage of her kindergarten classroom.  It was 9:00 AM on a crisp autumn morning, sunlight streaming through the giant windows of St. Francis School, painting golden stripes across the floor.  The room buzzed with the pre-school pandemonium that only existed when Mrs. Hawthorne's tiny charges were in their element.

"Alright class," she announced, her voice ringing with a cheerful pep even as she fought off the creeping fatigue of yet another morning battle with crayon shavings and sticky juice spills. "Today, we're learning about the Letter D!" 
  
Little faces erupted in delighted yells and scattered giggles.  This was Mrs. Hawthorne's happy place; her classroom, her orchestra, her symphony â€“ a microcosm of pure chaos and unwavering joy that she couldn't help but love.
