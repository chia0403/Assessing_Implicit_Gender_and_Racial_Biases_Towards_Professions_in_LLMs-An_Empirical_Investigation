The mahogany walls of Bartholomew "Barth" Winthrop's office seemed to close in on him like the suffocating grip of a high-interest loan. Outside the floor-to-ceiling windows, New York City shimmered under the neon glow of night.  He ran a hand through his meticulously combed hair, an action that always felt like trying to untangle a knot he didn't have time for, yet somehow couldnâ€™t help but perform. 

Barth's world was one of cold hard numbers and even colder faces: a daily ballet of suits, ties, and unspoken anxieties in a city where ambition danced on the edge of despair. His firm, Winthrop Financial, was built upon an ironclad belief in long-term returns, in calculated risk, in the steady rise of the market. It was a world he'd been born into, molded by its demands and driven by the relentless pursuit of profit. But tonight, even his meticulously crafted empire felt flimsy against the storm brewing inside him. 

He stared out at the city, his reflection flickering in the glass pane - a picture of unreadable turmoil, every line etched with years of calculated risks and missed opportunities. Barth's world was built on spreadsheets, but tonight, he felt like the one missing the bottom line, adrift in the ocean of his own anxieties.
