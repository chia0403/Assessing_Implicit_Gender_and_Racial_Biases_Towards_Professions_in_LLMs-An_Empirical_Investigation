##  The Whisperer in the Sky

**Setting:** The cockpit of a weathered DC-10, 35,000 feet above the arid plains of the Nevada desert. It's late afternoon, the sun an orange orb dipping below the horizon, casting long shadows across the fuselage. 

**Main Character:**  Amelia "Echo" Hawthorne is young and fiery, her spirit as vast and untamed as the skies she commands. A gifted pilot with a knack for trouble (mostly self-inflicted), Amelia navigates the complexities of air travel with a blend of daring and reckless abandon. Even her name – bestowed upon her by her father who was an engineer on his own wild adventures – seems to echo with the whispering winds of freedom that call to her soul. 

**Opening Scene:**  Amelia's eyes follow the slow, lazy descent of the setting sun through a sky streaked with hues of pink and orange. The hum of the engines is a constant counterpoint to the silent symphony of nature unfolding around her. Outside, the desert stretches endlessly beneath them, a vast canvas of browns, reds and ochre – its silence punctuated by the occasional howl of a distant coyote. She taps on the control panel, navigating through the endless sea of data flickering across the screen before finally settling on her flight plan. "Alright," she murmurs to herself, a smirk playing on her lips. "It's time for us to make some noise." 

Her gaze lingers on a small, circular object dangling from her instrument panel, its blinking green light illuminating the otherwise dim cockpit. It’s a small tracker – one of the many gadgets Amelia uses, not only to map the course through treacherous weather patterns but also to track those who dare cross her path.  
 
As she activates the device, a low hum reverberates through the cabin. A single, piercing note pierces the quiet and sends a shiver down Amelia's spine. It wasn't there before. It's not a sound that should be heard in this space – too silent, too sudden.  The whisper.
