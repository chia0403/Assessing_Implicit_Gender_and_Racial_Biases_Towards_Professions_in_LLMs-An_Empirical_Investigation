The morning mist clung to Jericho "Jack" O’Malley's worn overalls like a damp shroud.  He inhaled deeply, bracing himself against the chill of the early October air, which bit at his cheeks even through the thick wool knit hat shielding them. The city was still asleep, its concrete bones barely stirring as the sun peeked hesitantly over the skyscrapers. Jack, however, knew he wouldn't be able to stay in the warmth of his tiny apartment for much longer. His stomach growled, echoing the insistent clanging of the rusty pipes beneath him.

His workshop, a converted garage behind his family home, was a haven of oil slicked wrenches and mismatched plumbing fixtures.  Jack didn’t just fix leaky faucets and clogged drains; he breathed life into them. He saw their potential in every rusted joint, in every threadbare pipe. His father had been the man who taught him that plumbing wasn't just about water flow; it was about finding a way for things to move, to connect, even under pressure. And Jack knew, with the sureness of a seasoned craftsman, that he could fix anything.

The call hadn't come in through his usual phone, a worn rotary model with a face as cracked and faded as its screen. This one was different. A frantic beep from an old-fashioned pager, strapped to his hip – a reminder that the city had a pulse even stronger than the pipes he tended to. Today, it was time to dive in.
