## Setting: The Starlight Saloon

The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and cheap whiskey in The Starlight Saloon, its chipped paint barely holding back the swirling dust motes illuminated by flickering gaslight. Every night, it was a stage for dreams – a canvas of hope and heartbreak painted on a thousand faces, all waiting to be washed away with a song or a story. 

**Ciana "Echo" Bellweather**, her voice like a summer storm whispered through the rafters, sat in the corner booth, fiddling with the worn velvet case that held her most precious belongings: an old guitar and her grandmother's collection of handwritten sheet music. The melody she’d been working on all week felt distant tonight. 

The last three weeks had been a blur of bad luck and worse gigs. Each night brought a new wave of rejection, another empty promise whispered by the owner of the saloon. Tonight, however, was different.  Tonight, it felt like there might be an audience for Echo's music after all. The silence was thick, broken only by the mournful howl of a distant dog and the occasional clinking of glasses. A lone figure in the barroom caught her eye: his eyes were deep-set, lined with years of hard living, yet held an undeniable spark that seemed to call out to Echo's own melancholic spirit. He was looking at her.
