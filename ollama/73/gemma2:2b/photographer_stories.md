Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Amelia Hayes' tiny apartment in Edinburgh, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heart.  She clutched her worn leather camera bag tighter as she stared out at the swirling grey sky, the city lights blurring into an indistinguishable mess. Outside, the cobblestones gleamed under a thin veil of water, reflecting the ghostly orange glow of the streetlamps â€“ a fitting reflection of her own inner turmoil.

Amelia was known throughout Edinburgh's art community for capturing the essence of life in fleeting moments; a smile on a child's face as they watched a bus go by, a solitary figure walking their dog through an autumnal park, the raw emotion that flickered across the eyes of someone passing through a busy marketplace.  She believed every city was a living soul, each street corner pulsating with stories untold, and her camera was merely the vessel for those stories to be heard. 

But tonight, Amelia wasn't aiming for fleeting beauty. Tonight, she felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her gut as she waited for the interview at the Edinburgh Chronicle.  Tonight, it felt more like capturing a storm than composing a portrait. And as the thunder boomed and lightning flashed across the sky, Amelia wondered if she had misjudged the storm brewing within her own soul.
