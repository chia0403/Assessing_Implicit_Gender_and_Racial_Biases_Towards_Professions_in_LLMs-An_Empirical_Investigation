The late afternoon sun, already bleeding into the dusty orange hues of an approaching sunset, cast long shadows across the workshop floor. Dust motes danced in the beams that sliced through the grimy windows, illuminating the chaos of tools and blueprints. It was here, amongst the clatter of metal on wood, the rhythmic hum of machines, and the acrid scent of sawdust, that Elias Blackwood worked his magic.  He wasn't a master craftsman, not by any stretch – but he could coax an elegant form from the most humble materials.

His usual booming voice had been replaced by a tense silence, his eyes like two chips of flint focused on Elias. The blueprints lay open in front of him, the intricate folds and curves mockingly elegant, yet conveying the daunting task ahead – transforming these sketches into reality for Mr. Thornton's latest architectural marvel: The Serpent's Lair, a spiraling, glass-walled structure destined to grace the city skyline. 

"This," Mr. Thornton rasped, his gaze lingering on Elias with an unsettling intensity, "needs to be perfect."
