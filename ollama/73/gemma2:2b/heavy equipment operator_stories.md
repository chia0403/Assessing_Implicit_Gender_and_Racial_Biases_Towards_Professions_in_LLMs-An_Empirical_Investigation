## The Rust Bucket's Rest 

The air hung thick with the scent of diesel and sweat, a familiar cocktail for Theodore "Ted" Carter, his nickname earned from the way he seemed to move through the world like a rusty tractor, slow but unwavering.  His hands, calloused and tanned from years spent wielding heavy machinery, gripped the worn leather wheel of his 20-ton articulated dump truck. The sun beat down on the sprawling construction site of New Eden, the dust devils twisting across the cracked asphalt like angry spirits. Ted’s eyes scanned the landscape - a patchwork quilt of concrete and steel, cranes straining against the sky, earthmovers rumbling like angry beasts in the distance.  He was supposed to be hauling away the debris of old foundations for the new housing development, but his mind drifted elsewhere, towards the rust-eaten behemoth parked under the shade of an aging oak - The Old Lady.   Her name, whispered with a mix of reverence and apprehension around the site, was enough to draw out Ted’s adventurous spirit like a magnet.
