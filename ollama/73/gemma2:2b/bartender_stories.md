The rain hammered against the faded neon "Salty Siren" sign outside, each drop like a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of urban discontent. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cologne, and forgotten dreams.  This was where Alaric Blackwood, more often known as "Al," spent his days. He worked the counter at the Salty Siren, his grizzled face a familiar sight to the regulars who filled this dingy bar by night. 

The year was 1947. The war raged on overseas, and even amidst the raucous laughter of boisterous sailors returning home from duty, there was a pervasive sense of unease in the air. Al knew better than anyone that the waves crashing against the shore weren't just the ocean's natural rhythm; they were also a constant murmur of anxieties waiting to be unleashed on an unsuspecting world. 

The bar was a microcosm of this unease, its patrons a tapestry woven with stories of lost loves and stolen dreams. Tonight, however, the bar pulsed with the unsettling quiet of someone about to say something big, something that would echo through the storm of their lives. Al watched as she slipped into her seat by the window, a wisp of smoke curling from her lips as she lit her cigarette. He knew he should be ignoring her. This was his life - tending to these broken souls. But there was something in her eyes that pulled him in; a reflection of the storm brewing within her, one that only he could possibly witness and perhaps even understand.
