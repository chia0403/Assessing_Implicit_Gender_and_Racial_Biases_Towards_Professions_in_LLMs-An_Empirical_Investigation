The scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sterile chlorine tang of the hospital's ventilation system.  This was Mrs. Amelia Nightingale's domain: The Nightingale Pharmacy, nestled snugly between an old-fashioned diner and a bustling bookstore.  Even in the dim afternoon light, her shelves overflowed with familiar remedies - packets of crushed aspirin, bottles of cough syrup, jars of honey-colored balm – all carefully arranged like soldiers on a battleground.

Amelia herself was anything but soldierly, though.  At 57, she was small and wiry, with eyes that crinkled at the edges as she smiled, revealing a row of silver teeth. Her hands, worn smooth by years of counting pills and measuring doses, still possessed an uncanny dexterity.   It wasn’t just her skill with medicine; it was how she dealt with people –  with understanding kindness in her voice, a gentle touch on a worried hand, and a reassuring knowing look. 

But the tranquility of her life was about to be shaken. A storm, brewing outside in an ugly display of dark clouds and howling wind, mirrored the turmoil within Amelia's heart.
