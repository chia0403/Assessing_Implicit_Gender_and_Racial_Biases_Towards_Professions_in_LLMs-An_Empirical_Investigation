Rain lashed against Dr. Eleanor Croft's office window, each drop exploding in miniature geysers as if mirroring the turmoil swirling within her own chest. The scent of fresh rain mingled with old paper and lavender air freshener, creating an oddly comforting aroma for a soul drowning in grief. 

Eleanor, usually so adept at calming others, struggled to soothe her own raw edges. Her client, Mrs. Anya Petrova, was a whirlwind of contradictions - a vibrant artist struggling with the loss of her husband, whose death left a void that seemed impossible to fill. "Life is a tapestry woven from threads," she had once told Eleanor, her eyes glistening like polished sapphires. "But some threads are simply stronger than others." 

Eleanor's heart ached for Mrs. Petrova. The image of the woman, crumpled and broken on the couch, haunted her thoughts. It wasnâ€™t just about weaving through loss - it was about finding that one thread that could pull the tapestry together again. But as she stared at the rain cascading down the glass, Eleanor felt more like a helpless spectator than an architect of hope.
