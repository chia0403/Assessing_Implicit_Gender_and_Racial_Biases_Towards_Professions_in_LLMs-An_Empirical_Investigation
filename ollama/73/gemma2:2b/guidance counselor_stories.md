Rain splattered against the windowpane of Ms. Eleanor Hayes' office, mirroring the tears that welled in her eyes as she stared at the student file. It was August, the summer months usually filled with joyous anticipation for new beginnings; instead, they seemed to echo with the hollow weight of unfinished business. 

Eleanor's gaze fell on a photograph: a smiling, boisterous teenager named Ethan Miller, his head tilted in an endearingly mischievous way.  He had been one of her "bright stars," a student she always hoped would leave his mark on the world, even as he struggled with a persistent anxiety that seemed to cling to him like the ever-present fog outside. 

Ethan's file was now open, its contents a chilling testament to the unraveling threads of Ethan's life: academic struggles, family turmoil, and a growing disconnect from the very guidance program he sought support for.  He hadn’t been seen at school since June – no calls, no emails, nothing but a silence heavier than any storm cloud. 

The air in Eleanor's office felt thick with the weight of unaddressed questions. Where had Ethan gone? And more importantly, what could she do to bring him back into the light?
