The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn linoleum floor of the examination room.  Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the cityscape outside into an impressionist painting of greens and greys. A shiver ran down Amelia Blythe's spine, not from the cold, but from the palpable tension in the air. Across from her sat Mr. Henry O'Malley, a weathered fisherman with eyes that held both the vastness of the ocean and the storm brewing within him. 

Amelia, a physician's assistant at the Mercy Clinic on the edge of the bustling coastal town of Havenwood, had seen her share of pain. But there was something about Mr. O'Malley's slumped shoulders and clenched jaw that spoke of a grief deeper than any physical ailment.  His wife, Mary, had been lost to the sea just a week ago, swallowed by the same unforgiving waves she'd once danced upon with reckless abandon. 

"Mr. O'Malley," Amelia began softly, her voice as calming as the lapping tide, "I know this is a difficult time. Please tell me what brings you here today."
