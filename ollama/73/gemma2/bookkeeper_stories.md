The air in Evelyn Beatrice Finch's tiny office hummed with the quiet whir of her ancient fan, struggling to fight back against the oppressive August heat baking down on Savannah. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, momentarily obscuring her vision as she squinted at the ledger before her. The numbers swam, refusing to cooperate.  

Evelyn ran a hand through her already messy bun, sighing in frustration. She loved numbers, always had. Their precise order, their logic – it calmed her soul like nothing else. But lately, something felt off. The ledgers of Mrs. Peabody's antique shop were as chaotic as a hurricane had swept through them, leaving behind a jumbled mess of receipts and invoices. It was unlike the usually meticulous Mrs. Peabody, adding an unsettling layer to Evelyn’s already simmering annoyance.   

As she struggled to decipher a scribbled receipt for "12 Porcelain Teacups - Bargain Price", the afternoon sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across her cluttered desk. Outside, the rhythmic chirping of crickets signaled the arrival of night in the city steeped in history and secrets. Evelyn knew those secrets well, having grown up amidst the whispered tales of Savannah's past, and a shiver ran down her spine as she felt an inexplicable unease settle over her. This wasn't just a bookkeeping nightmare; something deeper was at play.
