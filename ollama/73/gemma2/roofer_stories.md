The air hung thick with the scent of hot tar and sweat.  A bead of grime trickled down Ezekiel "Zeke" Blackwood's forehead, mingling with the already crusty layer of dust that clung to his skin. Above him, the July sun beat down with merciless intensity, turning the asphalt shingles beneath his feet into shimmering pools of heat. 

He squinted across the sprawling cityscape of New Orleans, the French Quarter a vibrant tapestry of pastel hues and wrought iron balconies in the distance.  The roar of traffic thrummed through Zeke's bones, a constant reminder of the city's frenetic pulse even on this hazy afternoon. A bead of sweat escaped his eye and he wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak across his soot-streaked face. Today, he was replacing the roof of Mrs. Dubois' Creole townhouse in the Garden District â€“ a stately mansion adorned with moss-draped oaks and overflowing flower boxes, a far cry from Zeke's humble shotgun house in the Ninth Ward.
