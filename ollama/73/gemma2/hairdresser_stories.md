The bell above the door tinkled merrily, its sound barely audible over the whirring of Claudia Juniper's hairdryer and the rhythmic snip-snip of her shears. Outside, the December wind howled down Maple Street, whipping snow into miniature tornadoes that danced around the ankles of passersby. Inside "Juniper & Jade," the warmth of a dozen hairdryers and simmering potpourri battles the chill, transforming the small salon into a haven of scent and sound.

Claudia Juniper, her dark curls pulled back in a neat bun, hummed along to Mariah Carey on the radio as she expertly sculpted a blunt bob for Mrs. Peterson, a regular who swore by Claudia's ability to "make her feel twenty years younger." But even with the familiar routine, Claudia couldn't shake a feeling of unease. It was the same feeling that had been prickling at her since last week, when a woman with eyes like frozen glaciers walked into the salon and left without speaking a word.
