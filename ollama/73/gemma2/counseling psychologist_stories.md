Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Celeste's office, each drop a tiny hammer against the glass panes. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of lavender essential oil and old paperbacks. A crackling fire in the hearth cast flickering shadows across the worn Persian rug, doing little to dispel the chill that seemed to seep from the very walls.

Amelia glanced at her reflection in the polished mahogany desk, smoothing down the stray hairs that had escaped her braid. Her usual calm demeanor felt strained, a tight knot of tension pulling at her chest.  She hadn't felt this unsettled since...well, she couldn't remember when. Perhaps it was the storm, brewing both outside and within her.

Or perhaps it was the new patient waiting patiently in the corner chair, his face obscured by the shadows, his silence a heavy presence filling the room. 


The clock chimed five times, signaling the end of another turbulent workday. She had seen four patients today, each carrying their own burdens – grief, anxiety, anger – and she'd done her best to guide them through the labyrinth of their minds. But this patient...there was something different about him. Something unsettling that made Amelia’s skin crawl with a primal unease she couldn't shake.
