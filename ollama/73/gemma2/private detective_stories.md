Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew “Bart” Blackwood’s office, mirroring the turmoil brewing within him. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma in this corner of New Orleans he affectionately dubbed "The Devil's Half-Mile."  Neon signs flickered like dying fireflies, casting long, distorted shadows across the rain-slicked streets below. Bart stared out at the scene, his reflection – a shadow of a man with tired eyes and a weary smile – staring back. He wasn’t sure if he was more concerned about the case in front of him or the storm brewing inside him.  

A dame had walked into his office an hour ago, her perfume a cloying cloud masking the scent of fear. She spoke of a missing husband, a secret society, and whispered tales of voodoo gone wrong. But there was something more in her eyes, a flicker of pain that resonated with Bart's own haunted past. A past he desperately tried to outrun. Now, with the city drowning in both rain and secrets,  he found himself drawn into another case, another fight against the darkness that seemed to cling to him like a second skin.
