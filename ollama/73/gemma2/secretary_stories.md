The rhythmic click-clack of Eleanor Beatrice Finch's heels on the polished marble floor was almost as predictable as Mr. Hemmingsworth's morning cough. 

Eleanor worked for Alistair Hemmingsworth, a man whose wealth was only surpassed by his eccentricity. He owned half the buildings in downtown Zenith and had a peculiar fascination with taxidermied hummingbirds, which he kept in glass cases throughout his office. Every day, Eleanor navigated this bizarre landscape – dodging stray plush toys and carefully avoiding stepping on squeaking rubber ducks that Alistair insisted were "for inspiration." 

Today, however, something was different.  A nervous energy buzzed in the air, even more palpable than usual. A tall man in a crisp suit stood stiffly beside Mr. Hemmingsworth's grand mahogany desk, his face pale and etched with worry. Eleanor knew that look – someone who had stumbled into the labyrinthine world of Alistair Hemmingsworth's business dealings and found themselves lost and bewildered.


She straightened her neatly pressed skirt and approached them, a practiced smile already blooming on her face. “Good morning, Mr. Hemmingsworth,” she chirped, her voice as sweet as honey, "anything I can help you with?" 

Alistair gestured towards the man beside him. "Eleanor," he boomed, his voice echoing through the cavernous office, "this is Professor Davenport. He's here about... a rather peculiar proposition."
