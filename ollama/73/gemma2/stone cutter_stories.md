The air hung thick with dust and the scent of sandstone, a familiar perfume to Elias Thornebrook, his calloused fingers tracing the rough lines of a particularly stubborn slab. Sunlight streamed through the dusty skylight, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature galaxies. Outside, the bustling market square of Alora throbbed with life, hawkers shouting their wares and children chasing stray cats between stalls. But inside Elias' workshop, nestled in a quiet alleyway behind the main thoroughfare, time moved at its own pace. The rhythmic rasp of his chisel against stone was the only sound that broke the silence, save for the occasional creak of the ancient wooden beams supporting the roof.  Elias, sweat beading on his brow, focused on the task at hand: sculpting a delicate rosebud from a block of pale alabaster, its petals promising to bloom with ethereal beauty. This commission, from the city's wealthiest merchant no less, was a chance for Elias to finally showcase his talent, a chance to leave behind the shadow of his father, a renowned stonemason whose legacy weighed heavily on Elias' shoulders.  Yet, as he chipped away at the stone, a knot of apprehension tightened in his chest. The rosebud demanded precision, finesse, a touch that felt elusive even to his practiced hand. This wasn't just any commission; it was a test, not just of his skill, but of his ability to forge his own path, independent of his father's name.
