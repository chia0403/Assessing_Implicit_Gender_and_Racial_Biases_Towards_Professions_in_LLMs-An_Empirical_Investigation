The air hung thick with the scent of turpentine and dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through the grimy attic window. Eleanor Beatrice Finchley, known simply as Ellie to everyone except her mother, squinted at her canvas, frustration prickling at the back of her neck. Her brush lay abandoned on the paint-splattered table beside a half-empty pot of cerulean blue - the exact shade she'd envisioned for the sky, yet somehow it looked garish and wrong against the sullen charcoal strokes that formed the city skyline below. 

Ellie lived in a rambling Victorian house perched precariously on the edge of a forgotten industrial district in Manchester. The once-grand mansion, now chipped and weathered, was filled with faded grandeur - dusty portraits of stern-faced ancestors lining the hallways, threadbare velvet curtains clinging to cracked windowpanes, and an echoing silence punctuated only by the rhythmic drip of a leaky faucet in the kitchen. It was a world away from the vibrant art scene that pulsed in the heart of the city, but Ellie found solace in its melancholic beauty. 


The attic, with its sloping ceilings and cobweb-laden corners, had become her sanctuary - a space where she could lose herself in the swirling chaos of colours and textures, striving to capture the essence of Manchester's forgotten souls on canvas. But today, the city seemed as elusive as ever, mocking her with its indifference.
