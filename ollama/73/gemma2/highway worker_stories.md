The sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Thorne's neck as he surveyed his domain: Highway 12, stretching out before him like a shimmering ribbon under the relentless August sky. The asphalt shimmered in the heat, each ripple reflecting the hazy blue expanse above. Eli squinted, tugging at the brim of his weathered straw hat and wiping sweat from his brow. It was always hot this time of year, baking the tar into a thick paste and turning even breathing into a chore.

Eli had been patching Highway 12 for fifteen years, ever since his dad retired. He knew every inch of it – the subtle dips where rain pooled, the patches that held more potholes than asphalt, the rusted out guardrail just past mile marker 47. It wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest, and it kept a roof over his head and food on his table. Besides, Eli liked being alone with his thoughts, the rhythmic clang of his hammer a steady counterpoint to the hum of traffic blurring in the distance.  


Today, however, felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, a prickling unease that had nothing to do with the heat. The trucks were passing slower than usual, their drivers glancing nervously at Eli as they sped by. Even the crows, normally boisterous and plentiful, seemed subdued, their calls muted whispers in the stillness. 


Eli couldn't shake the feeling that something was coming, something big, something he wasn’t prepared for. His hand instinctively went to the worn handle of his grandfather's hunting knife, a small comfort against the growing sense of foreboding. He took a deep breath, trying to push aside the unease and focus on the task at hand. But the prickling sensation remained, an unwelcome reminder that even on the desolate stretch of Highway 12, nothing stayed quiet forever.
