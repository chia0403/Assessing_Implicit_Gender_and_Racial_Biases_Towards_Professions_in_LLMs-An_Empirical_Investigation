The sun streamed through the stained-glass windows of Ms. Elara Rosethorn’s classroom, casting rainbows across the miniature furniture scattered about. Bubbles bounced merrily from her hand to the giggling cluster of five-year-olds, their bright, curious eyes fixed on her every move. She was a whirlwind of colour and energy, leading them through their morning circle time with a melody as sweet as honey. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling sensation crawled up Elara's spine, a feeling she couldn't quite place.  The children seemed unusually subdued, their usual boisterous laughter muted to hushed whispers.  Even the ever-vibrant sunshine seemed to dim slightly, casting long, wavering shadows across the vibrant playroom. As Elara began to read their favorite story about a brave little bear, her gaze fell upon a single, scarlet poppy tucked amongst the familiar crayons and paints. It shouldn't be there. Poppies weren’t supposed to bloom in November, and definitely not in a kindergarten classroom in sunny California.  


Elara glanced at her watch, noting the time – 10:03 am. The prickling sensation intensified, turning into a full-blown shiver. She dismissed it as nerves, a reaction to the inexplicable poppy. But deep down, Elara knew something was amiss, and she couldn't shake the feeling that this ordinary day was about to take an extraordinary turn.
