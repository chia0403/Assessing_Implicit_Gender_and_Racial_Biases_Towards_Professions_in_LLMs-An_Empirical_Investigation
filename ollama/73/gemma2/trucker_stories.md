The asphalt ribbon stretched before him, shimmering under the relentless Texas sun.  Sweat beaded on Caleb "Coyote" McAlister's brow as he adjusted his worn Stetson, squinting against the glare. He gripped the steering wheel of his rig, the 'Iron Mule', a 1997 Peterbilt 379 with faded chrome and an engine that purred like a contented lion. The air inside the cab hummed with the whine of the diesel, punctuated by the rhythmic click of Caleb's CB radio.

The setting sun painted the endless expanse of Texan plains in hues of orange and purple, casting long shadows from the sparse mesquite bushes lining the roadside. A lone hawk circled overhead, its sharp cry echoing through the stillness. The air carried the scent of dust and sagebrush, a familiar comfort to Caleb after years spent traversing these lonely highways. 

He was hauling a load of frozen chicken parts from Amarillo to San Antonio, just another Tuesday on his endless journey. But tonight felt different. A tightness coiled in Caleb's gut, an unease he couldn't shake off. The CB crackled with static, but beneath it all, he swore he heard a whisper, faint and fleeting, calling his name.
