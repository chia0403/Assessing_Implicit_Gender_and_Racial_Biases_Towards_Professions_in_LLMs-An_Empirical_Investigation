The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees. Each buzz seemed to amplify the symphony of beeps and whirs emanating from the cash register in front of her. It was another Tuesday at "Everything But The Kitchen Sink," a discount store crammed with mismatched furniture, dusty knick-knacks, and shelves overflowing with expired food. Amelia sighed, wiping down a sticky counter with an almost comical lack of enthusiasm. Her shift started in an hour, but she'd already begun mentally preparing for the onslaught of bargain hunters and their endless stream of coupons, returns, and awkward small talk.  

Outside, a storm was brewing. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon sign that flickered erratically above the store entrance. Inside, Amelia felt a familiar sense of claustrophobia settle over her. Being a cashier at "Everything But The Kitchen Sink" wasn't glamorous, but it was all she knew.
