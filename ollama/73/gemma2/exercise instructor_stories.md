The air hung thick with humidity in the tiny converted garage studio. The scent of lavender disinfectant battled with the faint metallic tang of sweat, a familiar aroma that clung to Amelia Rose Harper like a second skin. It was 6:30 AM, the pre-dawn light just beginning to peek through the dusty skylights, casting long, spidery shadows across the worn wooden floor.  Amelia, her dark braids pulled tight against her forehead, stood in front of the mirror, adjusting the waistband of her lime green yoga pants and giving a quick scan of her reflection. She was ready. 

Her eyes swept over the faces of the few students already scattered on their mats: Mrs. Petrov, perpetually clutching her knees, Mr. Garcia with his perpetually furrowed brow, and young Emily, whose enthusiasm always made Amelia smile. They were an eclectic bunch, united by the shared desire to shed a bit of stress, a few pounds, and maybe even a sliver of doubt in this unassuming studio tucked away on Elm Street.  But today felt different. Today, there was a buzz in the air, a palpable tension that had nothing to do with exertion or endorphins. Amelia couldn't quite place it, but she knew whatever it was, it was about to change everything.
