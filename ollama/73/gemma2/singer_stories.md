The humid New Orleans air clung to Esmeralda “Esme” Dubois like a second skin as she walked down Bourbon Street. The scent of jasmine and stale beer mingled with the rhythmic pulse of jazz spilling from every open doorway. Neon signs cast an erratic glow on the throngs of tourists, their faces flushed with a mix of excitement and cheap tequila. Esme, however, was immune to the city's usual chaos. She had grown up amidst this symphony of noise and light, her own voice finding its rhythm in its chaotic heartbeat. Tonight, though, felt different. A prickling anticipation danced beneath her skin, fueled by whispers she’d heard at the local music shops – whispers of a legendary talent scout seeking out raw, unpolished voices like hers.  


Tonight was the night Esme would audition for him.
