The sun, a searing eye in the sapphire sky, beat down on Jasper Claymore's weathered neck as he surveyed his cattle herd. Dust devils danced across the parched plains of Montana, swirling like miniature tornadoes around the lone water trough that serviced half the ranch. This year, even the stubborn cacti seemed to be wilting under the relentless heatwave. 

Jasper ran a calloused hand over the brim of his dusty Stetson, squinting at the horizon where the land dipped into a hazy, shimmering distance. The cattle were restless, their lowing a mournful symphony against the oppressive silence of the plains. This wasn't just a drought; it felt like the earth itself was holding its breath, waiting for something to break. 


Jasper Claymore, his name as sturdy and unyielding as the land he tended, knew that time was running out.  He had to make a decision, one that could either save his ranch or see it crumble under the relentless grip of the summer's wrath.
