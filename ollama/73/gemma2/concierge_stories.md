The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the polished mahogany desk in Eleanor Beaumont’s domain. The Grand Majestic Hotel, a behemoth of Victorian elegance nestled on the precipice of London's bustling Theatreland, hummed with the energy of a thousand whispers. Tonight, however, the usual symphony of clinking glasses and murmured conversations was muted by an undercurrent of unease. A storm raged outside, lashing the windows with sheets of rain and sending shivers down Eleanor’s spine. She ran a gloved hand over the brass nameplate on her desk: "Miss E. Beaumont, Concierge." 

Eleanor prided herself on being a calm anchor in the tempestuous sea of human desires. But tonight, even she couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. A pall hung over the usually jovial staff, and guests huddled in their rooms, curtains drawn against the storm’s fury. Then, the phone rang, its shrill trill cutting through the heavy silence like a shard of glass.  

"Grand Majestic Hotel, Miss Beaumont speaking." She took a breath, steeling herself for whatever inquiry might be waiting on the other end, but the voice that answered was unlike anything she had ever heard before. 


“I need your help,” it rasped, "But I can’t come to you.”
