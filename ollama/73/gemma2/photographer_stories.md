The Parisian air hung heavy with the scent of freshly baked bread and impending rain as Eloise Beaumont adjusted her camera strap.  She inhaled deeply, letting the city’s symphony of honking horns and chattering voices wash over her. It was moments like these, nestled in the heart of Montmartre, that reminded Eloise why she loved capturing Paris through her lens.

The cobblestone streets, slick with a recent drizzle, were almost deserted this early morning. The iconic Sacré-Cœur Basilica peeked above the rooftops, its white dome dusted with an ethereal veil of mist.  Eloise, eager to capture the city's unique melancholic beauty before the day’s chaos consumed it, began her trek up the winding path towards the basilica, her camera bag slung across her shoulder like a familiar friend.
