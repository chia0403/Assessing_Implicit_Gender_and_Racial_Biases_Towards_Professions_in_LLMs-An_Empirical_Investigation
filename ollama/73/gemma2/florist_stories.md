The air in "Petals & Prose" was thick with the scent of lilies and rain-washed earth. Sunlight streamed through the shop's expansive windows, illuminating swirling motes of pollen dancing in the air. Rows upon rows of vibrant blooms lined the walls, from delicate orchids to boisterous sunflowers, each one carefully arranged by Amelia Rosethorn, proprietor and chief curator of floral beauty. 

Amelia, a woman with hair the color of wheat and eyes that mirrored the sky after a summer storm, was arranging a bouquet of deep crimson roses for a Valentine's Day order.  The delicate thorns pricked her finger, drawing a drop of blood that shimmered like ruby against the white petals. She didn't flinch, used to the occasional sacrifice nature demanded. The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new customer, and Amelia turned, a smile gracing her lips as she awaited their request. 


**Setting:** A quaint, independent flower shop called "Petals & Prose" located in a charming, slightly forgotten corner of a bustling city.
