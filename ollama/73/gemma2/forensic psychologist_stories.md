The flickering neon sign outside "The Rusty Nail" cast an oily sheen across Dr. Amelia Beaumont's rain-slicked trench coat. The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation, a familiar aroma in this part of town. She pushed through the door, its chime a tinny welcome to the cacophony of laughter and drunken arguments within.  Amelia scanned the dimly lit bar, her gaze settling on a man hunched over a half-empty glass of whiskey in the corner. He was dressed in what might have once been a fine suit, now crumpled and stained with cheap liquor. A bandage covered a gash on his forehead, stark against his pale skin. 

This was Arthur Finch, suspected accomplice to the most brutal murder the city had seen in years. Amelia wasn't here for another round of interrogation tactics. She was here for something more complex – to unravel the tangled threads of Arthur’s psyche, to understand the darkness that lay beneath the surface. This case wasn't just about solving a crime; it was about exploring the abyss within us all.  


**Setting:**

The Rusty Nail - A dingy, dimly lit bar in a rough part of town, known for its cheap drinks and even cheaper clientele.
