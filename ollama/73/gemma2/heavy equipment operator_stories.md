The humid Georgia air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Caleb Jackson like a second skin. Sweat trickled down his temple, stinging his eyes as he squinted at the digital readout on the Caterpillar D9 bulldozer’s control panel. 8:37 AM. Another scorcher was already baking the clay-red earth of the construction site. The roar of the engine vibrated through Caleb’s bones, a familiar and comforting hum that resonated with the rhythmic pulse of his life. He had been running this machine for ten years now, ever since he'd taken over his father’s business after the old man retired to Florida. 

Caleb maneuvered the D9 across the sprawling expanse of land, sculpting the landscape with each calculated push and pull of the blade. Rows of freshly dug trenches snaked across the field, waiting to be filled with drainage pipes and the foundation of the new suburban development that would soon rise from the dusty earth. The air buzzed with the symphony of construction – the whine of saws, the clanging of metal, the shouts of men directing traffic and hauling materials. But Caleb found solace in the solitude of his machine, a world where the only sounds were the growl of the engine and the scrape of steel against soil. 


This wasn’t just a job for Caleb; it was a legacy. His family had been shaping this land for generations, leaving their mark on the very fabric of Georgia. He felt a deep connection to the earth beneath his feet, to the sweat and toil that had built this town.  But today, as he surveyed the flattened expanse before him, a flicker of unease danced at the edge of his mind. There was something different about this project, something unsettling that he couldn’t quite put his finger on.
