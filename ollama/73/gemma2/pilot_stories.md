The air thrummed with static as Amelia "Ace" Cartwright gripped the yoke, her knuckles white against the worn leather.  She squinted through the dusty windshield of the battered A-10 Thunderbolt II, its metal flanks scarred from countless sorties over the sun-bleached Afghan landscape. The cockpit was a symphony of buzzing instruments and crackling radio chatter, punctuated by the rhythmic roar of the twin turbofan engines. Below, the desolate valley stretched out like a cracked, ochre canvas, dotted with scrubby bushes and the occasional mud-brick village that clung to life on the edge of this unforgiving land. 

Ace's gaze swept across the horizon, searching for any sign of movement.  Her squadron, nicknamed "The Hawks," was tasked with providing close air support to a ragtag battalion of Afghan National Army soldiers pinned down by insurgents in a fortified village nestled deep within the valley. The mission: to buy them enough time to regroup and escape the advancing enemy force. A simple objective, on paper. In reality, it felt like walking into a lion's den.
