The morning sun was already beating down on Trenton Steel's back as he wrestled with a steel beam twice his size. Sweat slicked his forearms, mixing with the grime that had become his second skin. The air hung heavy with the scent of diesel and burnt metal â€“ the familiar perfume of progress on the Brooklyn Bridge construction site.  

Trenton grunted, pushing the beam another inch along its track. Around him, a symphony of clanging hammers, roaring engines, and shouted instructions filled the air. Cranes like prehistoric giants swung massive loads overhead, their shadows crawling across the scaffolding that resembled an intricate metal jungle gym. Below, the East River gurgled lazily, a ribbon of blue cutting through the urban chaos. Trenton glanced down at the dizzying drop, his stomach tightening briefly before he focused on the task at hand. He wasn't afraid of heights; he was afraid of messing up, of being another statistic in the long list of construction workers who met their end on this very site. 


**Setting:**  

Brooklyn Bridge Construction Site, early 1900s. The air is thick with dust and the noise of machinery. Cranes loom over scaffolding that stretches towards the sky, and the East River flows below, reflecting the bustling activity above.
