The morning mist clung to Bartholomew Thistlewick’s boots like damp wool as he trudged across the dew-kissed lawns of Blackwood Manor. The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly turned earth, a fragrant blanket woven over the sprawling gardens that were his domain.  Bartholomew, or Bart as he was known to the few who dared address him by anything other than 'Mr. Thistlewick', meticulously inspected each rosebud, ensuring they faced the rising sun with pristine perfection. Every petal held the weight of Blackwood Manor's legacy – a symphony of vibrant colors orchestrated by generations past, entrusted to his calloused hands for safekeeping.  

The manor itself loomed above the gardens, an imposing Victorian mansion shrouded in whispers of forgotten tragedies and hidden secrets. Bartholomew had lived and worked there since he was a boy, serving as groundskeeper for the enigmatic Blackwood family who rarely ventured beyond their darkened walls. The silence that stretched across the manicured lawns felt almost oppressive, broken only by the chirping of sparrows and the distant creak of an unseen gate.  This morning, however, Bart sensed something different, a subtle shift in the air, like a premonition brewing beneath the surface of tranquility. It was a feeling he couldn't shake, a prickling awareness that the quietude of Blackwood Manor was about to be shattered.
