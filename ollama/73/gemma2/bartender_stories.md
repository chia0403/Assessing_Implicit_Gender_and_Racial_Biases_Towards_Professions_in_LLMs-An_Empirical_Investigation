The air hung thick with the mingled scent of stale beer, regret, and desperation – a symphony peculiar to The Rusty Mug. Rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon sign that flickered erratically outside. Inside, it was always twilight, even on sunny days.  

Behind the bar, Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne polished a chipped pint glass with practiced indifference. Her dark eyes, usually bright and observant, were clouded with weariness as she surveyed the familiar faces hunched over their drinks. There was Benny, his usual melancholy magnified tenfold by tonight’s downpour; Mrs. O’Malley, clutching a tumbler of whiskey like it held the answer to her troubles; and young Tommy, barely legal, nursing a beer that seemed far too big for him. 

Amy knew their stories. She knew their secrets. They spilled them out over shots of cheap tequila and whispered confessions into empty glasses. The Rusty Mug wasn't just a bar; it was a confessional booth, a haven for the lost and the lonely, and Amy, with her quiet wisdom and bottomless empathy, was its reluctant priestess. 


Tonight, though, even Amy felt weary.  The rain seemed to echo the ache in her own heart, a hollow space that refused to be filled. As she reached for another bottle of whiskey, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. A tall figure stepped inside, shaking off the rain like water off a dog's back.
