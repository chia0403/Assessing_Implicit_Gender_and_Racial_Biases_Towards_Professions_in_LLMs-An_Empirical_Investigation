The flickering fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Bartholomew "Bart" Quillian's head as he pushed his mop across the polished floor of the grand ballroom. The scent of stale champagne and forgotten laughter lingered in the air, a ghostly echo of the lavish gala that had ended hours ago. Bart, clad in his faded green uniform and scuffed rubber gloves, was oblivious to the remnants of opulence surrounding him. His attention was focused on the stubborn stain near the ornate fountain, a sticky mess likely left by some overzealous dancer who'd tripped mid-pirouette.  

The grand ballroom, with its soaring vaulted ceiling adorned with intricate murals and crystal chandeliers casting long shadows across the polished marble floor, stood in stark contrast to Bart's humble reality. This opulent space, where the elite danced and dined, was his nightly domain after the last guest had departed. He felt a strange sense of ownership in the silence, a quiet intimacy he wouldn't find anywhere else.  The building itself, an aging Victorian mansion known as Blackwood Manor, held secrets within its walls â€“ whispers of past scandals, forgotten romances, and perhaps even a touch of the paranormal. Bart had heard them all, piecing together fragments from gossiping maids and late-night shifts spent in the echoing halls.  But for now, his focus remained on the stain. It was just another Tuesday night at Blackwood Manor.
