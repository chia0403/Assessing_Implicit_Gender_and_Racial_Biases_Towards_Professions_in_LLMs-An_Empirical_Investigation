The humid air hung heavy over Charleston, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Sinclair like a second skin as she walked down King Street. The scent of jasmine and salt air mingled with the faint aroma of grilling shrimp from one of the many sidewalk restaurants lining the cobblestone street. Amy adjusted the strap of her canvas tote bag, its weight reassuring against her hip. It held her laptop, recipe cards filled with vibrant notes in her neat handwriting, and a well-worn copy of "The China Study" – her bible for navigating the complex world of nutrition. 

She paused at the corner of Market Street, watching the afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling scene. The old city pulsed with life – tourists snapping photos of brightly colored storefronts, locals gossiping over coffee, and street musicians filling the air with soulful melodies. Amy took a deep breath, savoring the familiar sights and sounds that made Charleston her home. Today, she was meeting with a new client at her cozy office tucked away on a side street, a woman battling persistent fatigue who hoped Amy could help her regain her energy through the power of food. As Amy turned the corner towards her practice, a flicker of excitement danced in her eyes – another chance to make a difference, one plate at a time.
