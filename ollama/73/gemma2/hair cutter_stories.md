The humid air hung thick in "Shear Delight," clinging to Penelope Willow's damp cotton apron like a second skin. It wasn't just the August heat radiating off the cracked pavement outside; it was the humidity of unspoken tension that settled over her salon whenever Mrs. Henderson walked through those doors. 

Penelope, with her unruly auburn curls perpetually escaping their braid and bright green eyes that darted nervously between her scissors and Mrs. Henderson's tightly pursed lips, dreaded these appointments.  The woman held a power over the neighborhood unlike anyone else; she knew everyone's business, judged everything, and whispered it all with a saccharine smile on her perfectly sculpted face. 

This time, Penelope could feel the weight of Mrs. Henderson's scrutiny even before the door opened. It was always the same: a rustle of silk as she entered, followed by a sharp intake of breath that seemed to suck all the air out of the room. Then, the inevitable, "Penny dear," her voice like brittle toffee, "I need something... daring."


The setting is a small-town hair salon called "Shear Delight" in a neighborhood where gossip travels faster than wildfire.
