The grease clung to Elias "Eli" Blackwood's hands like a second skin. It was the scent of his life, a comforting aroma of oil, metal, and burnt rubber that always seemed to linger in his workshop even after hours. 

His workshop was nestled on the outskirts of Pine Ridge, a small town where time moved slower than the rusty Ford pickup Eli had just finished restoring. The building itself was an amalgamation of salvaged parts: mismatched windows scavenged from abandoned barns, a tin roof that groaned with every gust of wind, and a door patched together so many times it looked like a patchwork quilt. Inside, tools hung on every available surface, each one bearing the marks of countless repairs and restorations. 

Eli wasn't just fixing cars; he was reviving their spirits, breathing life back into engines that sputtered and coughed like tired old men. He loved the challenge, the puzzle of figuring out what was wrong, the satisfaction of seeing a machine run smoothly again.  


He wiped his hands on a rag, leaving behind a streak of black against his already grimy skin, and stepped outside. The sun was setting, casting long shadows across his cluttered yard. A chill wind rustled through the dry leaves, carrying with it the faint scent of pine needles and something else...something different.
