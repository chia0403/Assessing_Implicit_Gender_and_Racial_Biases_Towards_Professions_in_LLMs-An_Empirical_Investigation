The air in "Voyages & Visions" hung thick with the scent of jasmine incense and old paperbacks. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature galaxies. Amelia Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose as she surveyed the chaos of her office. 

Travel brochures were piled high on every surface, maps unfurled across the floor like colorful sea monsters, and a half-eaten croissant lay abandoned next to a travel journal filled with meticulously crafted itineraries. Amelia sighed. Her once tidy haven had become a battleground against wanderlust, each brochure a whispering siren song luring her clients (and herself) to distant shores. 


Her phone buzzed. "Voyages & Visions," she answered brightly, hoping this call would be different from the last five - all desperate pleas for refunds or complaints about delayed flights.
