The morning mist clung to Willow Creek Sanctuary like a ghostly shroud, muffling the usual chorus of avian calls. Amelia Thistlewick, her boots sinking slightly into the dewy grass, tugged her woolen coat tighter against the chill. The air smelled faintly of damp earth and hay, a comforting aroma that always greeted her at the sanctuary. She surveyed the sprawling grounds before her, a patchwork of paddocks, barns, and enclosures housing a menagerie of rescued creatures.

Amelia, with her freckled nose perpetually dusted with flour from baking for the animals, was more than just a caretaker; she was a confidante, a nurse, a champion for the voiceless. She knew each resident by name and quirk, from the grumpy old goat, Bartholomew, to the mischievous pair of rescued otters, Pip and Squeak. Today, however, a sense of unease prickled at her. A strange stillness hung in the air, a disruption to the familiar rhythm of life at the sanctuary. 


This quiet was not peaceful; it felt like the hush before a storm.
