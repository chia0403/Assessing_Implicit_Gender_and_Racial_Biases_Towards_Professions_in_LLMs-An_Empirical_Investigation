Elara "Lara" Hawthorne adjusted the pristine white linen napkin on Lord Beaumont's breakfast plate, her movements practiced and silent. Sunlight streamed through the leaded windows of the grand dining room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. Polished mahogany gleamed underfoot, and the scent of fresh roses drifted from a vase near the fireplace. The room was a symphony of order, a testament to Lara's meticulous care. But behind the impeccable facade, whispers lingered - rumors of Lord Beaumontâ€™s recent reclusiveness, his unsettling nightmares, and an unseen presence that haunted the sprawling manor.

Lara had worked at Beaumont Hall for five years, ever since she was orphaned and taken in by the estate manager. She knew every creak of the floorboards, every hidden passage, every secret the house held.  But lately, even Lara felt a chill crawl down her spine as she went about her duties. The whispers were growing louder, and the air itself seemed to hum with an unseen energy.  


One crisp autumn morning, while cleaning Lord Beaumont's study, Lara found a hidden compartment in his desk. Inside lay a small, worn leather-bound journal.
