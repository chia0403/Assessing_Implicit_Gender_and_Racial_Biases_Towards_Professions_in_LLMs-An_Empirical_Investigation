The morning sunlight slanted through the cracked windowpane, painting stripes of gold across Mrs. Eleanor Bellweather's cluttered desk. A half-eaten bagel sat forlornly beside a crumpled grading sheet, casualties of the whirlwind that was her third-grade classroom. Outside, the cacophony of children starting their day - shrieks, giggles, and the rhythmic thump of feet on the playground - filtered through the cracked glass. 

Eleanor sighed, rubbing her weary eyes. It was the first day back after spring break, and the energy levels in Room 104 were off the charts. The smell of crayons and glue lingered in the air, a familiar scent that both comforted and overwhelmed her. She glanced at the calendar taped to the wall: March 27th. Only six weeks left until summer vacation, her personal sanctuary where she could escape the whirlwind of tiny humans and their endless demands.  


For now, though, Eleanor had a classroom full of eight-year-olds buzzing with pent-up energy, waiting for their lesson on fractions to begin. She took a deep breath, adjusted her spectacles, and braced herself. It was going to be a long day.
