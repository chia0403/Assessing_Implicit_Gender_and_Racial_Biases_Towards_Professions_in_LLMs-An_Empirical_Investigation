The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice Finchley's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of identical desks in the fourth-floor office of Sterling & Smith Accountants.  Eleanor meticulously counted back each pencil eraser, ensuring their placement fell neatly into the lined box labelled 'Erasers - Blue'. Her brow furrowed slightly as she realized one was missing. It wasn't a big deal, just an annoying detail amidst the vast tapestry of figures and spreadsheets that made up her day-to-day life.  

The air in the office held the faint aroma of burnt coffee and desperation, a potent mix fueled by the looming tax season deadline. Eleanor took a sip from her lukewarm mug, grimacing at the bitter taste. Outside, London thrummed with its usual chaotic energy, but within the confines of Sterling & Smith, time seemed to move in slow, agonizing increments.
