The scent of aged paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting aroma that Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewick knew by heart. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows of the Oakhaven Public Library, illuminating motes dancing in the dusty beams. Eleanor adjusted her spectacles, their silver frames catching the light, and surveyed her domain with quiet satisfaction. The shelves, reaching towards the vaulted ceiling like wooden fingers, were laden with countless volumes, each a portal to another world. 

Oakhaven itself was a sleepy town, nestled amidst rolling hills and ancient oaks, where time seemed to move at its own languid pace. Its inhabitants cherished their traditions, their lives woven into the fabric of this charming village.  Eleanor, a woman who had spent her entire life surrounded by stories, felt deeply connected to both Oakhaven and its library, which held within its walls not just books, but the very history and soul of the town. 

Today, however, the usual tranquility was shattered. A frantic pounding at the grand oak doors broke the silence, pulling Eleanor from her reverie.  She rose from behind her desk, a sense of foreboding creeping over her. This wasn't like Oakhaven. Something was amiss.
