The humid Georgia air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Sweat plastered Eliza Marie Carter's blouse to her back as she trudged up the porch steps of the dilapidated house. The paint peeled like sunburned skin, revealing rotting wood beneath. A rusted swing set creaked listlessly in the overgrown yard, a testament to forgotten childhoods. This wasn't the kind of neighborhood where dreams thrived.  

Eliza, seasoned probation officer for the past ten years, adjusted her sensible cardigan and inhaled deeply. Fear prickled at her skin, but it was overshadowed by a familiar sense of purpose. She had seen this before â€“ broken homes, shattered lives, the desperate struggle to climb out of a hole that seemed bottomless. This time, though, she carried with her the weight of a recent tragedy, a case gone wrong that left its mark on her soul.  

As Eliza raised her hand to knock, a sudden raucous barking erupted from within the house, sending a shiver down her spine. She prayed it wouldn't be another day filled with anger, resentment, and the suffocating grip of despair.
