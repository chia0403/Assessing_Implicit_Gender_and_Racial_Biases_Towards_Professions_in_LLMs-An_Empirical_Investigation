The air in Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Finch's studio hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and regret.  

Her eyes, usually sparkling with creative fire, were bloodshot from all-nighters spent wrestling with the latest marketing campaign for "Blooming Buds," an online flower delivery service that seemed more interested in whimsical fonts than actual floral arrangements. 

Amy's once pristine workspace was a battlefield of crumpled paper sketches, overflowing coffee cups, and half-eaten granola bars. A stray cat hair, caught in the crosshairs of her desk lamp, seemed to mock her efforts. Outside, the sun was just beginning to peek over the terracotta rooftops of the Parisian neighborhood, casting long shadows across the cobblestone streets below. The Eiffel Tower, a silent sentinel against the dawn sky, felt as distant and unreachable as Amy's own aspirations.

Her deadline loomed – 8:00 AM sharp – and she had yet to produce a single design that didn't look like it was pulled from a kindergarten craft project.  The weight of her client's expectations, the pressure of making rent, and the gnawing fear that she might be losing her creative spark all pressed down on Amy with the force of a leaden sky. 


This was not how a successful graphic designer was supposed to feel. But then again, this wasn't exactly the glamorous life Amy had envisioned for herself when she first moved to Paris.
