The August humidity hung heavy in Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's hair as she stepped out of her car.  Sweat beaded on her upper lip despite the fan blasting inside the vehicle. She smoothed down her crisp white linen blazer, feeling the fabric cling uncomfortably to her skin. 

Amelia was at another open house, this one a sprawling Victorian perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic in the seaside town of Seahaven. The paint peeled like sunburned skin and the porch sagged under the weight of years, but Amelia knew better than to judge a book by its cover. Beneath the faded grandeur, she sensed the whispers of forgotten parties and laughter echoing through the dusty halls. This house held stories, just as every one did, and Amelia was determined to unearth them.

She surveyed the scene: a handful of potential buyers milling around the drawing room, their faces betraying a mix of curiosity and skepticism. A gaggle of seagulls squawked in the distance, their cries mingling with the rhythmic crash of waves against the rocks below.  Amelia took a deep breath, the salty air filling her lungs. It was going to be another long day, but Amelia Cartwright relished the challenge.
