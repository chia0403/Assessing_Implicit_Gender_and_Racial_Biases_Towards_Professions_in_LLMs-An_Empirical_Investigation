The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Eleanor Vance’s sprawling clinic, bathing the waiting room in a warm, golden light.  She surveyed the scene with a sigh: Mrs. Peabody fussing over her dachshund, Sparky, while a teenage girl nervously stroked the fur of a jittery Persian named Mittens. The air hummed with a familiar symphony of barks, meows, and the rustle of anxious paws on linoleum floors.

Eleanor ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, smoothing down the crisp white coat that hung slightly askew.  She'd been running this practice for ten years, ever since graduating from Cornell with top honors, a dream she’d held since childhood. Yet, lately, the joy in the work had begun to dim. The endless stream of sick and injured animals, coupled with the rising costs of medicine and the mounting pressure of keeping up with her staff's needs, left Eleanor feeling weary. Perhaps it was time for a change, she thought, watching Sparky wriggle impatiently at Mrs. Peabody's touch. 

But tonight, there was a new case that promised to be both challenging and intriguing. A call came in earlier from the local wildlife rescue about a strange creature found injured in the woods – something unlike anything Eleanor had ever encountered. It piqued her curiosity, igniting a spark of excitement she hadn't felt in weeks.  Maybe, just maybe, this was the challenge she needed to reignite her passion for healing.
