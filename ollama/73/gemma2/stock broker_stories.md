Sweat prickled at his collar, but the discomfort was overshadowed by the simmering tension in his gut. His phone vibrated, a jarring reminder of the ticking clock.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the glass and steel canyons of Lower Manhattan, where Alec's office towered above the bustling city.

Inside, his world was a whirlwind of flashing screens, ringing phones, and hushed whispers of market fluctuations.  His desk, cluttered with financial reports and half-empty coffee cups, bore witness to the relentless pressure he faced every day.

Today, however, felt different. The usual hum of the trading floor seemed muted, replaced by an anxious silence that gnawed at Alec's nerves.  A high-stakes deal, a potential life changer, was on the verge of collapsing. If he couldn't pull it off, his career – and possibly his future – would be jeopardized. 


He gripped his phone tighter, steeling himself for the call he knew was coming. This wasn't just about money; it was about proving himself, about silencing the whispers of doubt that had begun to plague him lately.
