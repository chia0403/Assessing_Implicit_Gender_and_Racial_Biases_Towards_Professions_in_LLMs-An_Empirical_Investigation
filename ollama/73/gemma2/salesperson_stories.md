The humid Georgia air hung heavy like a damp towel as Elias "Eli" Thorne wrestled his way through the throngs of people milling around the convention center. Beads of sweat prickled at his hairline, threatening to cascade down his temple and drip onto the pristine white linen of his shirt. He hated these events, the crowded halls buzzing with forced enthusiasm, the endless stream of disingenuous smiles and empty promises. Yet, here he was, representing Thorne & Sons Industries, peddling their latest invention – the "SmartShovel," a self-propelling tool guaranteed to revolutionize the landscaping industry. 

Eli adjusted his tie, feeling the cheap polyester scratch at his throat. He longed for the familiar comfort of his dusty office back in Athens, surrounded by stacks of blueprints and the comforting hum of his antique drafting table. But duty called, and duty meant navigating this chaotic sea of eager buyers, skeptical competitors, and hungry journalists, all vying for a piece of Thorne & Sons' latest pie. 

Eli spotted his booth – a bright, sterile island amidst the chaos, adorned with an inflatable shovel that bobbed rhythmically in the artificial breeze. He sighed, a small wave of nausea washing over him. This was going to be a long day.
