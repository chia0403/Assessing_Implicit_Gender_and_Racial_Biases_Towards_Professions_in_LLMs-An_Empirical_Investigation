The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood's workshop hung thick with the scent of sawdust and beeswax. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing like fireflies in the silence.  His calloused hands rested on the workbench, cradling a piece of oak as smooth as a babe's cheek. Outside, the bustling streets of Charleston hummed with life - carriages clattered over cobblestones, hawkers shouted their wares, and laughter echoed from nearby taverns. 

But here, in Bart's sanctuary nestled in a forgotten corner of the city, time seemed to move differently. The rhythmic tick-tock of his grandfather clock was the only constant, its steady beat a comforting counterpoint to the symphony of the city beyond the workshop door. He inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar scent of wood and varnish – a smell that spoke of creation, of transforming raw materials into something beautiful and enduring.  

Today, he was crafting a rocking chair for Mrs. Eleanor Winthrop's ailing daughter. A delicate piece, requiring precision and patience.  Each curve had to be perfect, each join as tight and secure as a lover’s embrace, to cradle the child gently and soothe her troubled sleep. As Bart began his work, the world outside faded away, leaving him alone with the wood and the weight of his craft.
