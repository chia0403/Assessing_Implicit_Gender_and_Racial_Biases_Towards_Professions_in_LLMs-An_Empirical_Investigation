The air in Dr. Albright's office was thick with the scent of peppermint and sterile disinfectant.  Eleanor Penelope Thistlewood, or Ellie as everyone called her, carefully adjusted her head lamp and surveyed her patient. Mr. Henderson, a retired history professor, was staring blankly at the ceiling, his usual jovial frown replaced by a grimace of pure discomfort. 

Ellie sighed inwardly. This wasn't how she liked to start her mornings.  She preferred the quiet hum of the ultrasonic scaler against tooth enamel, the reassuring clink of instruments in their trays, and the occasional polite conversation with a patient about their weekend plans. Mr. Henderson, however, had developed an unfortunate habit of experiencing phantom pain during cleanings. Today was no exception. 

Ellie's small dental practice nestled in a quaint Victorian building on Maple Street wasn’t exactly bustling. It catered to the older residents of the town, many of whom had known Ellie and her mother, the previous owner, for decades. The creaking floorboards and faded floral wallpaper held memories woven into the very fabric of the building. Outside, the first blush of autumn painted the trees in vibrant hues of crimson and gold, a stark contrast to the sterile white walls within.


Ellie took a deep breath, preparing herself for another round of Mr. Henderson's theatrical pain expressions. This was just another Tuesday morning in Ellie Thistlewood's world –  a world where gentle smiles and sharp instruments coexisted in a delicate dance of comfort and necessity.
