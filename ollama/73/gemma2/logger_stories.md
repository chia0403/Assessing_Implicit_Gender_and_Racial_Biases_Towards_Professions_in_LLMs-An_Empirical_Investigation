The air hung thick with the smell of pine and damp earth, the morning mist clinging to the towering Douglas firs like a ghostly shroud. Dew sparkled on the rough bark, catching the first rays of dawn in a thousand tiny diamonds. 

A chill wind whistled through the ancient trees, rustling their needles and sending shivers down the spine of Silas Blackwood, his weathered face creased with concentration as he surveyed the timber ahead. His calloused hands tightened around the worn leather grip of his axe, muscles coiled like springs beneath his faded flannel shirt. This wasn't just a job for Silas, it was a legacy, a connection to the land that ran deeper than blood. He was born and raised in this forest, knew its secrets as intimately as he knew his own name – Silas Blackwood, logger extraordinaire, some called him, though he preferred the simpler title of “woodcutter.”


The setting sun cast long shadows through the towering pines, bathing everything in a warm, amber light. The air hummed with the sounds of cicadas and the distant call of an owl. This was Silas's domain, his kingdom of green and brown, where he felt most alive. Today, however, something felt different. There was an unease in the air, a subtle shift that prickled at the back of his neck. 


Silas tightened his grip on his axe, his gaze sweeping across the familiar landscape. He could feel eyes watching him, unseen presences lurking just beyond the edge of his vision.  His heart hammered against his ribs, a primal fear stirring deep within him. Something was amiss.
