The scent of jasmine hung heavy in the air, competing with the sharp tang of bleach from Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's recently scrubbed work gloves. She surveyed her latest project: a sprawling Victorian mansion perched precariously on a cliff overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic.  

Amelia adjusted the silk scarf tied around her unruly auburn curls, feeling the damp sea breeze whip it about her face.  The house groaned around her, its ancient bones weary from years of neglect. Stained-glass windows cast fractured rainbows across dusty furniture draped in white sheets like ghostly figures. 


This wasn't Amelia’s usual clientele – she usually dealt with tasteful modern apartments and sleek city lofts. But Lord Montgomery, the reclusive owner, had charmed her with his passionate pleas for a "return to grandeur." He promised a treasure trove of forgotten antiques waiting to be unearthed and a story whispered through every creaking floorboard.  

Amelia took a deep breath, the scent of jasmine morphing into something else – perhaps salt, or old wood, or the ghosts of untold stories. This house held secrets, she could feel it in her bones. And Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, with her keen eye and even keener intuition, was determined to uncover them all.
