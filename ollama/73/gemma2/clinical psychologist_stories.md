The rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, each drop a tiny drumbeat against the silence inside.  Her waiting room, usually a haven of soft beige and calming aromas, felt oppressive tonight, thick with the unspoken anxieties of the storm outside and those within. 

Eleanor sat at her desk, reviewing a case file. The patient, a young woman named Clara, was struggling with debilitating anxiety attacks triggered by seemingly mundane events – a crowded supermarket, a spilled cup of coffee, the insistent chirping of a robin outside her window. Eleanor had seen this kind of response before, but something about Clara’s case felt different, a layer of unease she couldn't quite place. The woman’s journal entries, filled with vivid nightmares and an unsettling obsession with shadows, hinted at a deeper darkness lurking beneath the surface.  

The wind howled, rattling the windows like skeletal fingers clawing at the glass. Eleanor took a deep breath, pushing aside her unease. It was always darkest before the storm, she reminded herself. 


Eleanor Vance prided herself on her ability to remain calm and collected in any situation. But tonight, as the storm raged outside and the shadows danced across her office walls, even she felt a shiver of apprehension. This wasn't just another night of helping anxious patients; something felt profoundly wrong.
