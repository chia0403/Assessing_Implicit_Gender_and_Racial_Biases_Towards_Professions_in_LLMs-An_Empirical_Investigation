The pungent smell of stale coffee and graphite lingered in the air, mingling with the rhythmic hum of the drafting tables.  Sunlight slanted through the grimy windows of the drafting room at the Atlas Steel Works, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air. Clara Beatrice Hemmingsworth, her brow furrowed in concentration, meticulously drafted blueprints for a new bridge design. Her pencil danced across the parchment, etching lines that would soon hold the weight of countless vehicles and dreams. The worn leather of her drafting stool creaked with every movement as she worked, a comforting soundtrack to her solitary routine.  


Outside, the steel city of Atlas hummed with industry. The clang of hammers on metal, the hiss of steam escaping from factories, and the rumble of trains filled the air, a constant reminder of the relentless march of progress. But within the confines of the drafting room, Clara found a quiet sanctuary, a space where she could shape the future, one precise line at a time.
