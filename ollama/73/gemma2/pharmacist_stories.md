The air in Willow Creek Pharmacy hung thick with the scent of peppermint cough drops and lavender hand sanitizer.  

Amelia Rose Thornton, her auburn hair pulled back in a neat bun, meticulously sorted blister packs of vitamins onto the shelves. A lone customer browsed through the greeting cards, their hushed whispers echoing in the quiet afternoon lull. 

Willow Creek wasn't exactly bustling with life. Nestled amidst rolling hills and cornfields in rural Iowa, it was more accustomed to the lazy drone of cicadas than the frenetic pace of city life. But for Amelia, it was home.  She knew every face that walked through her pharmacy door, their ailments as familiar as their smiles. 


That is, until today. A sleek black car pulled up outside, its polished exterior gleaming under the summer sun. The driver emerged, a tall woman with piercing blue eyes and an aura of somethingâ€¦ different. This wasn't Willow Creek.  This was... change.
