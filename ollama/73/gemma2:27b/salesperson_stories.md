Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Bargain Buys," blurring the neon sign outside into a sickly smear of green and yellow.  Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Elias Finchley, his once-crisp suit now wrinkled and damp from battling the elements on his commute, sighed as he surveyed the sparse crowd. It was Tuesday afternoon – the graveyard shift for any retail warrior.

Elias wasn't born for this life. He had dreams, aspirations that stretched beyond dusty shelves stacked with discount toiletries and knock-off electronics. But life, like a malfunctioning appliance, rarely worked according to the manual. Now, he found himself trapped in Bargain Buys, peddling subpar goods to customers who looked as if they'd rather be anywhere else. 

Today, however, Elias felt a flicker of hope. A rumor had been circulating among the staff – whispers of a new product line arriving soon, something with the potential to breathe life back into this dying store.  Elias clung to that rumor like a lifeline, desperately hoping it would be his ticket out of Bargain Buys and into a brighter future.
