Sawdust danced in the morning sunbeams slanting through the grimy windows of Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's workshop. The air hung thick with the scent of cedar and pine, overlaid with a tang of linseed oil. Eli himself, a man built like an oak tree with calloused hands and eyes as blue as a summer sky after a storm, ran his rough thumb along the grain of a walnut table he was crafting. He paused, listening to the rhythmic rasp of his plane against the wood, a sound as familiar and comforting to him as his own heartbeat.

His workshop, tucked away in a quiet alley behind bustling Market Street, was Eli's sanctuary. Here, amidst the clutter of tools and half-finished projects, he found solace from the chaos of the city outside. Today, however, the usual tranquility was broken by the insistent rapping on his door. Eli sighed, knowing that whatever awaited him wouldn't be a friendly neighbor asking for a cup of sugar.
