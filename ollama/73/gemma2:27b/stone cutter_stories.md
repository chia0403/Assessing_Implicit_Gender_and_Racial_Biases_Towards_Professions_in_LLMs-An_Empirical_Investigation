The midday sun beat down on the quarry with relentless fury, baking the already hot limestone until it shimmered like molten gold. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh light, swirling around Elias Thorne's weathered face and calloused hands. He paused his work, wiping the sweat from his brow with a grimy rag, his keen eyes squinting against the glare.

Elias was a master stone cutter, renowned throughout the valley for his skill and artistry. His tools, though worn and nicked, moved with an almost uncanny grace in his hands, coaxing beauty and form from the rough, unyielding rock. Today, he was working on a commission for the town's new cathedral - a grand archway that would frame the entrance to the sacred space. It was a challenging piece, requiring both strength and finesse, but Elias relished the challenge. 

He picked up his hammer, its head worn smooth from years of use, and tapped it lightly against the stone. The sound reverberated through the quarry, a rhythmic counterpoint to the chirping of cicadas and the distant rumble of carts hauling away finished blocks. He closed his eyes for a moment, listening to the symphony of the quarry, feeling the vibrations travel up his arm and into his chest. This was his world, his domain â€“ a place where he could transform the raw power of nature into something enduring and beautiful.  

But today, something felt different. A sense of unease prickled at Elias's skin, like a sudden draft in a still room. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but he knew that something was about to change.
