Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Lantern, blurring the neon sign outside into a shimmering smear of red and gold. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale beer, cigarette smoke, and something faintly metallic that Elias Thorne, the barkeep, suspected was regret.

Elias, a man whose face held the kind of weariness only earned from years spent listening to other people's sorrows, polished a glass absentmindedly. His reflection stared back – dark hair threaded with silver, eyes the colour of storm clouds, and a jawline that could cut diamonds. He knew he looked every one of his fifty-odd years, but there was a glint in those tired eyes, a spark of something untamed, hidden beneath the layers of cynicism and experience.

Tonight, The Rusty Lantern felt emptier than usual.  A lone figure hunched over a whiskey at the far end of the bar, muttering to himself, while two women argued over a game of pool near the back. Elias sighed, wiping down the counter with unnecessary force. He'd been hoping for a quieter night – a chance to catch up on some reading, maybe even try his hand at that crossword puzzle he'd been saving. But fate, as it often did, had other plans.

The door creaked open, letting in a gust of wind and rain, along with a figure shrouded in shadow. Elias looked up, curiosity piqued. This wasn't one of his regulars.
