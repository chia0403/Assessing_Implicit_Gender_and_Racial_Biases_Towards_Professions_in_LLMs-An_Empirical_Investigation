The wind howled like a banshee across the obsidian plains, whipping snow into blinding swirls against Elara Blackwood’s face. She pulled her thick furs tighter, cursing the biting cold that seeped through even her warmest layers.  Elara wasn't built for this desolate wasteland; she craved the warmth of the sun on her skin and the smell of fresh earth, not the endless gray horizon stretching before her.

But duty called.

As a guard of the Obsidian Order, Elara was sworn to protect Kythera and its secrets, even if it meant freezing her backside off on a night like this. 


The city below pulsed with dim, ethereal light – the glow emanating from the heartstone embedded in the center of the metropolis. It pulsed with an eerie rhythm, a constant reminder of the power that lay beneath their feet, and the danger they guarded against.

Suddenly, a shadow flickered across the snow-covered expanse, catching Elara's eye. Her hand instinctively went to the hilt of her sword.  Something wasn't right.
