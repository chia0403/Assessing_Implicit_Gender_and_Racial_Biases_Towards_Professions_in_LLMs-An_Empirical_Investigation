The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed overhead like angry hornets, casting long, distorted shadows across the empty hallways of St. Sybil's Academy for Gifted Young Minds. Alistair Finchley, his silver hair gleaming under the sickly glow, pushed his battered metal cart down the corridor, its wheels squeaking a mournful tune against the polished linoleum.  The air hung heavy with the scent of old chalk dust and forgotten dreams, a familiar aroma that had permeated Alistair's life for the past twenty-five years.

He paused outside Room 304, the door slightly ajar. A faint whisper of laughter drifted out, followed by the unmistakable thud of something falling. Alistair sighed. Even at this ungodly hour, the students couldnâ€™t resist testing the boundaries. He pushed open the door cautiously and peered inside.  The room was in disarray, textbooks strewn across the floor, chairs overturned, and a lone quill pen bouncing rhythmically beneath a crooked blackboard.  

Alistair scanned the room but saw no sign of the culprits. Just then, a muffled gasp came from behind a towering stack of dusty encyclopedias. Alistair approached cautiously, his hand hovering near the mop handle strapped to his cart, ready for whatever mischief he might encounter.
