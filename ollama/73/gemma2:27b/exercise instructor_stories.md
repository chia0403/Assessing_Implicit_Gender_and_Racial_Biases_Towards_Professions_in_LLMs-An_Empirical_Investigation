The humid air clung to Amelia Rose Kensington like a second skin as she surveyed the pre-dawn stillness of Central Park. Dew glistened on the manicured lawns, reflecting the pale orange glow beginning to paint the eastern sky. A lone jogger huffed past, breaking the quiet with rhythmic footfalls. Amelia stretched her arms overhead, feeling the familiar ache in her shoulders from yesterday's bootcamp session.

Today was different. Today wasn't about pushing clients towards their personal best. Today was about finding hers. 


The annual "Sunrise Yoga Summit" awaited on the Great Lawn â€“ a gathering of instructors and enthusiasts from across the city, culminating in a mass yoga practice as the sun crested the horizon. Amelia had been hesitant to participate, intimidated by the thought of performing alongside seasoned yogis she'd only ever admired from afar. But something about the promise of shared energy and collective breath had called to her, urging her to step outside her comfort zone.
