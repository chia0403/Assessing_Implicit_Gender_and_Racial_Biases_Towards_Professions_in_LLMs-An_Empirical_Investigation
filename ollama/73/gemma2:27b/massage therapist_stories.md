Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity Massage & Wellness, blurring the city lights into a watercolor smear. Inside, Elara Rose Hawthorne adjusted the Himalayan salt lamp on her desk, its warm glow barely piercing the gloom settling over the room. A low rumble of thunder echoed through the building, making the vintage chimes hanging by the door clang dissonantly.  Elara sighed, tucking a stray curl behind her ear. The storm had driven away all but one client - a perpetually anxious accountant named Mr. Finch who swore Elara's deep tissue massage was the only thing keeping him sane.

She glanced at the clock. 7:45 pm. Mr. Finch was due in ten minutes. Usually, she relished these quiet evenings, a chance to catch up on paperwork or lose herself in a good book. But tonight, a gnawing unease twisted in her stomach. It wasn't just the storm; something felt off.
