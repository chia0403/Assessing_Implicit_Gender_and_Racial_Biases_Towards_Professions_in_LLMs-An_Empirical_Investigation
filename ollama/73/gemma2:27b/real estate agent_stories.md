Rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Cavendish's tiny office, blurring the view of the quaint Victorian homes lining Elm Street.  The scent of damp earth and overripe hydrangeas seeped in through the cracked windowpane, blending with the faint aroma of burnt coffee from the forgotten mug on her desk. Eleanor sighed, pushing away a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its braid. The phone hadn't rung all morning.

It was a Tuesday, which meant "Open House Day" for most realtors in Oakhaven, but Eleanor had no listings to showcase. Her last sale, a charming craftsman bungalow with stained glass windows, had closed three weeks ago, leaving her feeling adrift in a sea of empty appointments and unanswered emails.  


She needed a win, something to reignite the spark that had drawn her to real estate in the first place – the thrill of finding the perfect home for someone, of building connections and witnessing dreams come true. Today, however, all she felt was the gnawing anxiety of dwindling savings and mounting bills.

Suddenly, the shrill ring of the phone pierced through the melancholic drumming of the rain. Eleanor snatched up the receiver, her heart leaping with a surge of hope. "Eleanor Cavendish, realtor," she answered, bracing herself for another telemarketing call or an inquiry about a property already sold.  But this time, the voice on the other end was different – low and gravelly, tinged with an unfamiliar accent.

"Ms. Cavendish," the voice rasped, "I believe you have something of mine."
