The insistent chime of the shop bell announced another arrival, pulling Esmerelda "Esme" Vance from her meditative state as she snipped away at a stray curl on her mannequin. A gust of chilly November air followed the customer inside, swirling fallen leaves in its wake and momentarily stealing the warmth from the cozy salon. Esme sighed, tucking a rebellious strand behind her ear as she turned towards the newcomer.

The Salon du Chic was tucked away on a quiet side street in Asheville, North Carolina â€“ a haven of antique mirrors, exposed brick walls adorned with local art, and the comforting aroma of lavender and rosemary shampoo. 


Esme loved the calm rhythm of her days here. Snipping, styling, listening to the stories woven into each request for a trim or a new look. But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unsettling energy, and Esme couldn't shake the feeling that the customer who just walked in was more than just another appointment.
