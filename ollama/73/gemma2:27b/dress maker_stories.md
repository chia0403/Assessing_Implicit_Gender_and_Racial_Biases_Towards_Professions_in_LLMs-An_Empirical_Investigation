The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and sweat in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's cramped atelier. Sunlight, filtered through dusty windows overlooking the bustling Rue de Rivoli, painted stripes across the worn wooden floorboards. Spools of silk thread glinted like precious jewels scattered amongst bolts of luxurious velvet and shimmering brocade. Amelia, her nimble fingers stained a delicate lilac from the dye she'd just used, adjusted the tiny brass gears on her Singer sewing machine, the rhythmic whirring its familiar lullaby.

Today was a day for dreams, not deadlines. For Amelia wasn't stitching together another bodice or hemming a skirt for a wealthy matron. No, today she was crafting something far more fantastical: a gown fit for a moon princess. The midnight blue velvet shimmered under the single hanging lamp, its surface scattered with hundreds of hand-stitched silver stars that seemed to twinkle as Amelia worked.
