The rusty Cessna 172 coughed and sputtered as Elara Vance wrestled it into the air. Below her, the Nevada desert stretched out in an endless tapestry of ochre and sienna, cracked by dry washes and dotted with scrubby Joshua trees. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the cockpit into a furnace despite the open windows. Elara squinted against the glare, her weathered face etched with concentration as she fought to keep the aging plane aloft.  

She'd taken on this delivery job knowing it was risky - hauling a mysterious package across the unforgiving desert in a machine held together by duct tape and prayers wasn't exactly a walk in the park. But Elara needed the money, and something about the cryptic instructions from the anonymous client piqued her curiosity. They spoke of a "forgotten legacy" and a "hidden oasis," terms that resonated strangely with Elara's own yearning for something more, something beyond the mundane grind of piloting cargo across desolate landscapes.
