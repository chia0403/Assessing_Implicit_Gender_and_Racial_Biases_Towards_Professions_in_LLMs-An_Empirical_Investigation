The Grand Blackwood Hotel loomed over Bell Street like a gilded cage, its ornate facade reflecting the last rays of a dying sun. Inside, chaos reigned. A gaggle of socialites jostled for space by the grand staircase, their diamonds flashing like trapped fireflies. Suitcases piled up haphazardly near the entrance, their owners lost in animated conversations about unseen scandals and upcoming soir√©es.  

Through this whirlwind navigated Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew, a bellhop with a perpetually weary smile and shoulders stooped from years of hauling luggage. He expertly weaved between chattering guests and rolling carts, his eyes constantly scanning for stray suitcases or misplaced belongings. Teddy knew every nook and cranny of the Grand Blackwood, every creaky floorboard and dusty tapestry. It was his domain, even if he only inhabited its fringes, a silent observer to the dramas and desires that unfolded within its gilded walls. 

Today, however, something felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, thicker than the aroma of lilies wafting from the lobby's enormous vase. As Teddy approached a lone woman standing by the elevators, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, he couldn't shake the feeling that tonight wouldn't be like any other.
