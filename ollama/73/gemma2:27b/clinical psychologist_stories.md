Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the 'Open 24 Hours' sign across the street. Inside her cramped office, Dr. Amelia Thorne sighed, rubbing weary circles into her temples.  The worn leather of her armchair creaked in sympathy as she leaned back, the scent of lavender oil from her diffuser doing little to soothe the tension knotting her shoulders.

Amelia’s practice, nestled in a quiet corner of Chicago’s bustling West Loop, had always been a haven for those seeking solace from life's storms. Tonight, however, the storm seemed to be raging inside her own mind. A particularly challenging case – a young woman haunted by fragmented memories and crippling anxiety – had left Amelia questioning her own abilities. Was she truly equipped to navigate the labyrinthine corridors of the human psyche?

The insistent ringing of the phone jolted her from her thoughts. Glancing at the clock, she saw it was well past midnight.  Who could be calling at this hour? With a hesitant hand, she picked up the receiver. "Dr. Thorne speaking."
