The incessant chirping of plastic cicadas from the toy bin grated on Elara Mae Thompson’s nerves. It was a Tuesday, which meant Toddler Tuesdays at Sunshine Daycare, a symphony of sticky fingers, spilled juice, and high-pitched shrieks that could peel paint. Elara loved her job – truly, she did – but some days tested even her boundless reserves of patience.

Today was one such day.

Tiny hands tugged at her skirt, demanding attention.  Little Liam was wailing because his block tower had toppled (again), and Amelia was smearing mashed banana on the windowpane with joyous abandon. Elara sighed, feeling a familiar ache in her lower back. 


Sunshine Daycare was housed in an old Victorian house with peeling paint and crooked windows that looked out onto a tangle of overgrown rose bushes. Sunlight streamed through dusty panes, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like miniature ballerinas. The scent of disinfectant mingled with the sweet, yeasty aroma of baking bread wafting from the kitchen – Mrs. Peterson, the owner, was making her famous banana bread again.  

Elara loved the house's quirky charm, but today, even its sun-drenched rooms felt stifling. She longed for a moment of quiet, a chance to breathe and gather herself before the afternoon chaos descended.
