The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the waiting room. Amelia Rosewell sighed, tapping her pen against the laminated counter, her gaze flitting between the overflowing schedule on the computer screen and the door that refused to budge. It was always like this on Mondays - a tidal wave of patients needing their blood drawn before the week truly began.  

Amelia loved her job as a phlebotomist at Harborside Medical Clinic, despite the occasional rush and the prickling anxiety some patients brought with them. There was a certain satisfaction in mastering the delicate art of drawing blood, a quiet competence she felt deep within herself. Today, however, the usual calm was disrupted by a gnawing unease that had nothing to do with needles or nervous patients. 

The unsettling feeling started last Friday, after Mrs. Hawthorne, a regular, whispered something cryptic about "seeing shadows" and then abruptly left before Amelia could ask further questions. Since then, a strange tingling sensation had spread through Amelia's fingertips, intensifying whenever she thought about Mrs. Hawthorne's words. The clinic door finally swung open, breaking Amelia from her thoughts.  But instead of the usual tired faces seeking routine bloodwork, a man with piercing blue eyes and a haunted expression stepped inside. He was unlike anyone Amelia had ever seen.
