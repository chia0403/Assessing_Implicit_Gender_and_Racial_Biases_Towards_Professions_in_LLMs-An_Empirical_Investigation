Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quigley's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The cramped space, smelling faintly of stale coffee and desperation, felt more like a cell than a place of business. Papers littered his desk, each one representing a claim denied, a promise broken, another soul left reeling in the wake of misfortune.

Bart sighed, rubbing his weary eyes. He'd come to this city, this dying industrial town on the edge of nowhere, with dreams of making a difference. But five years in, all he felt was the weight of indifference, both from the people he served and the faceless corporation he worked for.  Today, however, something was different. A manila envelope sat on his desk, its contents hinting at a case unlike any other: The Blackwood Estate fire.

Bart gingerly lifted the envelope, the worn paper crackling under his touch. Inside, a single photograph stared back â€“ a sprawling Victorian mansion engulfed in flames, smoke billowing into the night sky like a wounded beast. This wasn't just another claim; this was a riddle wrapped in tragedy, and Bart, despite his weariness, felt a flicker of intrigue ignite within him.
