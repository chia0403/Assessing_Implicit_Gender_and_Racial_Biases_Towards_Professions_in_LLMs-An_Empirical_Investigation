Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Infirmary, mirroring the storm raging within Dr. Evelyn "Eve" Sinclair. The flickering gaslights cast long shadows across the crowded ward, illuminating faces etched with pain and despair. A cough, harsh and wet, ripped through the stillness, followed by a child's whimper. Eve gripped the edge of the worn wooden table, her knuckles white against the chipped paint. 

St. Jude's, nestled in the heart of London's grimy East End, was a haven for the city's forgotten souls - the factory workers crippled by industrial accidents, the destitute children ravaged by disease, and the countless souls whose only crime was being born into poverty. Eve had dedicated her life to these people, but tonight, the weight of their suffering felt unbearable.
