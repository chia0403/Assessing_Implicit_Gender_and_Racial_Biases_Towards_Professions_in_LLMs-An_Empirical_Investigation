Rain lashed against the corrugated tin roof of the clinic, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser of muddy water. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and woodsmoke, a peculiar combination that always made Eleanor Vance wrinkle her nose. Despite the oppressive humidity, she shivered, pulling her threadbare cardigan tighter around her thin frame. The single flickering bulb cast long, distorted shadows across the cramped waiting room, illuminating faces etched with worry and pain.

Eleanor, a physician assistant fresh out of Duke University, had arrived in this remote Honduran village three months ago, full of idealistic fervor. Now, exhaustion gnawed at her bones, and doubt wormed its way into her heart. The clinic was perpetually overflowing with patients suffering from ailments she'd only read about in textbooks â€“ malaria, dengue fever, parasitic infections. She yearned for the sterile hallways and state-of-the-art equipment of her residency program, but knew she couldn't abandon these people who relied on her so desperately.

As a cough erupted from the corner, followed by a child's whimper, Eleanor steeled herself. This was where she belonged, even if it meant battling relentless rain and limited resources. She was their only lifeline, and for now, that had to be enough.
