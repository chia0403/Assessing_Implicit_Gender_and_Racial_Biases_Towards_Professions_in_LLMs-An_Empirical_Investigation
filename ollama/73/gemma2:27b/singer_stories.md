The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of jasmine, clinging to Eliza Blackwood like a second skin as she stepped onto the ramshackle stage.  A lone spotlight cut through the gloom, illuminating a space barely big enough for her and her battered acoustic guitar. The "stage" was really just a platform of rotting planks hastily erected in the dusty courtyard of a crumbling colonial building. 

Behind Eliza, faded grandeur whispered from cracked walls adorned with peeling paint and overgrown vines. Vines that mirrored the tangled emotions twisting in her gut. This wasn't the polished stage sheâ€™d dreamed of as a girl, belting out tunes in her bedroom mirror. This was raw, real, and undeniably terrifying. But it was also an opportunity, a chance to prove herself in the heart of Havana's vibrant music scene.

Eliza took a deep breath, the scent of jasmine momentarily calming the butterflies in her stomach. Tonight, she would sing her soul out, hoping the crumbling walls would hold her voice and the hungry eyes before her would hear the truth within each note.
