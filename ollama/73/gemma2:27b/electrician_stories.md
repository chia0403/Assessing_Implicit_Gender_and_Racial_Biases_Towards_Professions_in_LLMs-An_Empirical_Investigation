The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Nail Tavern cast an eerie green glow on Elias Finch's grease-stained overalls. It pulsed like a tired heart, mirroring the exhaustion tugging at his own.  Elias, a man more comfortable with the hum of wires than the cacophony of drunken laughter spilling out onto the dusty street, adjusted the heavy tool bag slung over his shoulder and braced himself for another night shift. 

He wasn't supposed to be here, not tonight. The diner down the block had promised steady work rewiring their aging kitchen, but a power surge – ironically caused by faulty wiring – had plunged the entire town into darkness. Now Elias found himself answering the panicked call of Frankie "The Fuse" Deluca, owner of the Rusty Nail and notorious for his temperamental fuse box (both literally and figuratively).

Elias pushed open the tavern doors, the stench of stale beer and fried food hitting him like a wall. The room was dim, lit only by flickering candlelight and the occasional flare from a drunken patron's cigarette lighter. Frankie, a hulking man with a face like weathered granite, stood behind the bar, scowling at a tangle of exposed wires.

"Finch! Finally!" Frankie bellowed, his voice booming over the din. "Get to work. This whole place is about to go up in flames."

Elias sighed. Just another night on the job. He set down his bag and began inspecting the mess. It was worse than he'd anticipated.
