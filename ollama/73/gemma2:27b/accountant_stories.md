Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Theodore Fitzwilliam's cramped office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously above. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation – a potent cocktail that Theodore had become intimately acquainted with over his ten years as an accountant for struggling small businesses. Tonight, however, even the familiar scent couldn't mask the stench of panic emanating from the woman sitting opposite him.

Her name was Amelia Finch, and her bakery, "Amelia's Sweet Dreams," was on the verge of crumbling faster than a day-old croissant. Theodore surveyed the mess of receipts and invoices spread across his desk – a chaotic testament to Amelia's inability to juggle both her passion for baking and the mundane realities of running a business.
