The insistent chirping of his antique alarm clock dragged Dr. Alistair Finch from a dream populated by misaligned vertebrae and screaming muscles. Groaning, he swatted at the brass bird perched atop the clock, silencing its shrill protest. Sunlight streamed through the gauzy curtains of his bedroom window, casting long shadows across the worn hardwood floor. The air smelled faintly of lavender, a lingering aroma from last night's bath salts. Alistair stretched, feeling a satisfying pop in his lower back – a familiar occupational hazard for a chiropractor.

His practice, nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of historic Savannah, Georgia, awaited him. The building, a charming Victorian with peeling pastel paint and a wraparound porch, housed "Finch Family Chiropractic" - a legacy Alistair inherited from his grandfather. Today promised to be busy: Mrs. Patterson needed her usual adjustment for her chronic sciatica, young Timmy Jones had twisted his ankle playing baseball, and there was a new patient scheduled – a mysterious woman named Celeste Moreau who'd booked an appointment with a vague complaint of "general imbalance."  Intrigued by the enigmatic name and even more so by the poetic phrasing of her ailment, Alistair felt a familiar spark of excitement ignite within him. He loved the challenge of unraveling the complexities of the human body and restoring balance to its intricate framework. Today, he knew, would be no exception.
