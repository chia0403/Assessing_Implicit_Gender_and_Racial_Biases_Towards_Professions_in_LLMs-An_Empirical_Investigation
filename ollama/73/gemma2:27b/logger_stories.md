The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A low mist clung to the towering redwoods, their ancient trunks disappearing into the swirling gray. Silas Blackwood, his face weathered like bark and hands calloused from years of wielding an axe, paused in his work, listening intently. The usual symphony of the forest – the chirping of birds, the rustling of leaves, the distant gurgling of a creek – was muted, replaced by an unsettling silence. He frowned, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. Something wasn't right.

Silas had been logging these woods since he was a boy, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather before him. He knew every twist and turn of the overgrown trails, every hidden grove and whispering waterfall. Yet, this unnatural quiet sent a shiver down his spine. As he scanned the mist-shrouded trees, a flicker of movement caught his eye – something dark and sinuous disappearing behind the trunk of a giant redwood. His heart hammered in his chest.
