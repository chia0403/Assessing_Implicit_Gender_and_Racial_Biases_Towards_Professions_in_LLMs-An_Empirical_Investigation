Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Alistair "Al" McMillan's workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser on the greasy concrete floor. The air smelled of mildew, engine oil, and the faintly metallic tang of copper pipes – scents Al had come to associate with both comfort and impending doom. Today, it was definitely the latter.

His phone buzzed incessantly on the workbench beside him, each insistent vibration a jab of anxiety into his already frayed nerves. He hadn't slept properly in days. The call he'd been dreading finally came through – Mrs. Hemmings, her voice shrill and frantic, describing a "raging geyser" erupting from her bathroom sink. Al sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. It was Friday night, the only night he had off all week, and it was looking like another lost battle against the fickle whims of plumbing emergencies.


This is just an opening, so feel free to take it in any direction you want! You can:

* **Focus on the humor:** Al could be a grumpy but lovable plumber who begrudgingly accepts the call, finding amusement in the chaos Mrs. Hemmings' situation has created.
* **Go for suspense/mystery:** Perhaps the "raging geyser" is something more sinister than a simple burst pipe. Maybe it's connected to a hidden secret or danger lurking within Mrs. Hemmings' home. 
* **Explore Al's personal life:** He could be struggling with financial difficulties, relationship issues, or a past he wants to forget. The plumbing call might serve as a catalyst for him facing his problems head-on.

Good luck and have fun writing!
