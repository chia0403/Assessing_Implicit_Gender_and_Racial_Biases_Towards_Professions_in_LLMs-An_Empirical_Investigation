Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street. Inside Dr. Evelyn Reed's cozy office, tucked away on a quiet side street in Greenwich Village, the only sound was the steady tick of the antique grandfather clock and the muffled sobs coming from the woman perched on the edge of the plush armchair. Evelyn leaned forward, her hazel eyes filled with concern.

"Take your time, Amelia," she said softly, her voice a balm in the storm raging outside. "There's no need to rush." 

Amelia sniffed, dabbing at her tear-stained cheeks with a crumpled tissue. The scent of lavender and chamomile wafted from the diffuser, attempting to soothe the tension that crackled in the air. Evelyn knew this wouldn't be an easy session. Amelia, a recent college graduate, had arrived looking lost and overwhelmed, carrying a weight far heavier than her slender frame could bear.
