The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles of discounted groceries at "Bargain Bites." It was 3:47 pm on a Tuesday, and the usual post-work rush hadn't quite materialized.  Amelia idly tapped her manicured nails against the worn countertop, a symphony of boredom punctuated by the monotonous beeping of the scanner.

Outside, rain lashed against the grimy windows, blurring the neon sign that declared "Lowest Prices in Town!" Amelia sighed. This town, with its decaying industrial buildings and lingering scent of sulfur from the nearby paper mill, hardly seemed deserving of such a boast. Yet, here she was, stuck scanning cans of dented beans and expired ramen noodles for minimum wage. 

A bell chimed above the door, jolting Amelia from her reverie. A figure emerged from the gloom, shrouded in rain and mystery.
