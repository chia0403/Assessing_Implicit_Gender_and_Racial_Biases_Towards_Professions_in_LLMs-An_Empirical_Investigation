Rain lashed against the windows of "Hope Springs Physical Therapy," blurring the neon sign's cheery promise into an abstract swirl of color. Inside, Amelia Grace Hawthorne adjusted her glasses, frustration furrowing her brow as she reviewed the file in front of her. Mr. Henderson, a retired carpenter who'd shattered his hip in a fall, was making frustratingly slow progress.

The air in the small treatment room was thick with the scent of antiseptic and liniment. Amelia sighed, picturing Mr. Henderson struggling on the parallel bars, his face etched with pain and doubt. He needed a breakthrough, something to reignite the spark of determination that had flickered dimly since his accident.  

Amelia rose, her worn sneakers squeaking against the linoleum floor. It was time for a new approach. Time to remind Mr. Henderson of the strength he possessed, hidden beneath the fear and limitations.
