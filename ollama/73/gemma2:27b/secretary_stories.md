The rhythmic clatter of Beatrice Adelaide Worthington's typewriter was the only sound that dared break the oppressive silence of Mr. Bartholomew's office. Outside, the relentless July sun beat down on the cobblestones of Chancery Lane, turning the air thick and heavy. Beatrice, however, remained blissfully unaware of the sweltering heat, her focus entirely consumed by the endless stream of correspondence pouring across her desk. 

Beatrice, with her neatly coiffed auburn hair and spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, was a creature of routine. Every morning began the same: arrive promptly at nine, brew a pot of strong Earl Grey for Mr. Bartholomew (two sugars), and tackle the ever-growing pile of letters, memos, and invoices that threatened to engulf her small corner desk.

But today was different. A manila envelope, thicker than the others, lay nestled amongst the usual correspondence. It bore no return address, only a cryptic wax seal embossed with the image of a serpent entwined around a quill. As Beatrice reached for it, a shiver ran down her spine, prickling the back of her neck. Something about this letter felt...unsettling.
