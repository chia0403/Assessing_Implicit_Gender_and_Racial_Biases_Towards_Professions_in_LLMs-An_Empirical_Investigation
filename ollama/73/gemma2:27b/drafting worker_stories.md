The acrid smell of ammonia clung to Beatrice Albright's worn overalls as she leaned over her drafting table, squinting at the blueprints spread before her. The late afternoon sun slanted through the grimy window of the cramped office, casting long shadows across the faded linoleum floor. Outside, the clamour of the shipyard echoed, a symphony of clanging metal, grinding gears, and shouted commands. Beatrice, however, was lost in her own world, meticulously tracing the delicate lines that would soon translate into the skeletal frame of a magnificent new dreadnought. 

The air hung heavy with anticipation. The shipyard buzzed with rumours of this latest commission, whispers of its size, its power, and its destined role in protecting the empire's sprawling colonies. Beatrice, though normally content in her solitary work, felt a surge of pride knowing that her precise drafts would contribute to such a monumental undertaking.
