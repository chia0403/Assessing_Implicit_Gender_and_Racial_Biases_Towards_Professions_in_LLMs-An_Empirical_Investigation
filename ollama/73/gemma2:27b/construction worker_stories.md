The midday sun beat down on Elias Finnigan's neck, turning the sweat gathering beneath his hard hat into a hot, itchy stream. He wiped it away with the back of his calloused hand, grimacing as the grit from yesterday's concrete pour scratched against his skin.

Elias stood perched precariously on the steel beams of the half-constructed skyscraper, gazing out over the sprawling city below.  The constant drone of traffic and construction equipment provided a chaotic soundtrack to his solitude. He was 30 stories above street level, the wind whipping at his worn overalls, carrying with it the distant scent of exhaust fumes and hot dogs from a nearby vendor.

Today was supposed to be another routine day: laying rebar, pouring concrete, moving mountains of steel. But something felt different. A tingling unease prickled beneath Elias's skin, a feeling he couldn't quite shake off. Perhaps it was the unsettling way the sun glinted off the glass facade of the nearby bank building, reflecting a shard of light directly into his eyes. Or maybe it was the sudden stillness in the air, the lull before a storm.

Whatever the reason, Elias felt a growing sense of foreboding. He knew this city, its pulse and rhythms, like the back of his calloused hand. And something wasn't right.
