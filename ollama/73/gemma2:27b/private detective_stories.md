Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the Lucky Dragon sign across the street. A lone saxophone wailed from somewhere down the alley, its mournful notes swallowed by the incessant drumming of the storm.  Smoke curled lazily from Alistair Finch’s cigarette, momentarily obscuring his sharp features and the glint in his steel-grey eyes. The air in his cramped office hung heavy with the mingled scents of stale coffee, cheap whiskey, and desperation.

Alistair wasn't a man who dealt in hope. He dealt in facts, in shadows, in the secrets people buried deep within themselves – the kind of secrets that usually ended up on his desk, stained with tears and guilt, wrapped in promises of payment Alistair knew he’d likely never see.

Tonight’s visitor was no exception. A young woman, barely out of her teens, stood trembling by the door, clutching a faded photograph like a lifeline. Her eyes, wide and red-rimmed, darted nervously around the cluttered room before settling on Alistair's face with a mixture of fear and pleading. "Mr. Finch," she stammered, her voice barely above a whisper, "They said you could help..."

The photograph fluttered in her hand. A man, handsome and smiling, stared back at them both.
