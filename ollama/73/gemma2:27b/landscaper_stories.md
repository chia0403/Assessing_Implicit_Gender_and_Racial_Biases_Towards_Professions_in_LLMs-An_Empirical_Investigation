The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Estates, turning the meticulously trimmed hedges into emerald silhouettes. Elias Thornwood crouched beside a bed of lavender roses, his calloused fingers gently teasing apart tangled stems. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, mingling with the grime that perpetually stained his face.

Elias wasn't just any landscaper. He possessed an almost mystical connection to plants, able to sense their needs before they even manifested. He could coax a wilting daisy back to life with a whispered word and a touch, and his rose bushes bloomed in profusion, spilling over their trellises like waterfalls of vibrant color.

But today, something felt off. A subtle shift in the air, a hushed stillness that contradicted the usual buzzing symphony of cicadas and birdsong.  As Elias straightened up, brushing dirt from his worn denim overalls, he noticed a single, withered rose drooping amidst its flourishing brethren. Its petals were brown and brittle, curled inwards as if in despair.

This wasn't normal. The Thornwood roses, as they were affectionately known by the residents of Willow Creek, were renowned for their resilience. Elias ran his thumb over the shriveled petal, a cold dread settling in his stomach. This was more than just a dying flower; it felt like a warning.
