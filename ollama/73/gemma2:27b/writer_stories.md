Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the frantic drumming of Emilia Blackwood's fingers on her antique typewriter. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wood and old paper, punctuated by the occasional whiff of lavender from a sachet tucked away in a dusty drawer. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, its mournful cry weaving through the gaps in the attic walls.

Emilia paused, her brow furrowed as she stared at the half-written page before her. Words swam on the paper, refusing to coalesce into anything resembling a coherent narrative. The story she'd been working on – a gothic mystery set in a crumbling manor house haunted by a vengeful spirit – had stalled, its once vibrant characters now reduced to hollow puppets.

Frustration gnawed at Emilia. She longed for inspiration, for the Muse to whisper tales into her ear and guide her pen across the page. But tonight, the Muse was silent, leaving Emilia alone with the storm raging both outside and within her own soul.
