Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Greyhound bus, blurring the already indistinct lights of rural Montana. The engine coughed and sputtered, mimicking the turmoil churning in Elias "Eli" Blackwood's gut. He wasn't built for buses, or long journeys. Eli was a man of fields, of sweat-soaked jerseys and echoing whistles. His domain was the dusty expanse of the high school football field back in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, not this cramped metal box hurtling through endless darkness.

He clutched the worn leather of his duffel bag, inside which lay the dreams – and anxieties – of a dozen teenage boys. Eli had been their coach for three years, molding them into a formidable team that defied their small-town origins. Now, they were headed to the State Championships, facing off against powerhouse teams from bigger cities. 

Eli glanced at the sleeping figures around him, weary travelers seeking solace in dreams. He envied their obliviousness. His mind was consumed with plays, formations, and the daunting task of motivating his boys against overwhelming odds. Could he really lead them to victory?  Doubt gnawed at him like a hungry wolf.
