The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil, gasoline, and ozone â€“ a perfume unique to Elias "Eli" Blackwood's world. Outside, the late summer sun beat down on Dusty Creek, baking the asphalt of Main Street until it shimmered. Eli wiped his brow with the back of his grease-stained hand, peering into the engine of a rusted '67 Mustang. Its once-proud crimson paint was now faded to a dusty rose, mirroring the weary town itself. 

Dusty Creek wasn't much to look at - a handful of storefronts struggling to stay afloat, houses with peeling paint and sagging porches, and a main street that saw more tumbleweeds than tourists. But for Eli, it was home. He knew every creak of the floorboards in his family's garage, Blackwood's Auto Repair, a legacy passed down from his grandfather. It wasn't fancy, but it was his sanctuary, filled with the comforting rhythm of engines purring back to life and the satisfaction of fixing what others deemed broken.
