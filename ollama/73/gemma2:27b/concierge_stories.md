Rain lashed against the ornate windows of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist painting of shimmering lights and swirling grey. Inside, the lobby buzzed with hushed conversation and the clatter of porcelain on silver as guests enjoyed afternoon tea. Bartholomew Alistair Cavendish III, impeccably dressed in his signature charcoal suit and crisp white gloves, surveyed the scene with a hawk's eye.

As Head Concierge of the Grand Blackwood, Bartholomew prided himself on anticipating every guest's need before it even arose. He knew their favorite teas, the precise temperature they preferred their baths, and which pillow provided optimal support for their sleep. Today, however, a new face had arrived â€“ one that promised to disrupt Bartholomew's carefully orchestrated world of refined luxury.

A woman with fiery red hair and eyes like emerald fire stood by the grand oak doors, her luggage clutched tightly in one hand. She radiated an aura of restless energy, utterly at odds with the tranquil atmosphere of the hotel. Bartholomew straightened his bowtie and prepared himself for the encounter. He knew, with a certainty born from years of experience, that this woman was going to be trouble.
