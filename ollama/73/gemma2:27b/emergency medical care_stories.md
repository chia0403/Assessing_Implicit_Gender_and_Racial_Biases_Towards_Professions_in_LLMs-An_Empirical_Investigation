The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and woodsmoke, barely masking the metallic tang that always clung to Elias Hawthorne, despite the triple-wash he'd done on arrival at the cabin. He knelt beside the sputtering campfire, its flames casting dancing shadows across his calloused hands as he meticulously cleaned a set of surgical instruments. A symphony of chirping crickets and distant owl hoots filled the silence between him and his companion â€“ a battered first-aid kit bursting with gauze, painkillers, and other necessities.

Elias wasn't your average weekend warrior escaping the city grind. He was an EMT, stationed in the heart of urban chaos where sirens wailed and life hung by a thread on a daily basis. This remote cabin in the Appalachian mountains was his sanctuary, a place to breathe and reconnect with a quieter rhythm of life.

But tonight, even the comforting crackle of the fire couldn't drown out the insistent hum of worry gnawing at him.  A call had come through earlier that day - a frantic plea for help from a remote logging camp miles beyond cell service range.
