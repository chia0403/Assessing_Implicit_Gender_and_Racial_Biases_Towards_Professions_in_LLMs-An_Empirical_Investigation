Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. The air inside hung thick with the mingled scents of hay, damp fur, and something distinctly musky â€“ a skunk, most likely, decided Elizabeth "Beth" Hawthorne. She sighed, her breath fogging in the cool air. This was supposed to be her day off.

Beth wasn't just any caretaker; she ran Harmony Haven, a sanctuary for abandoned, injured, or unwanted animals nestled on the outskirts of sleepy Oakhaven, Vermont. Her haven housed everything from skittish rabbits and grumpy goats to a one-winged owl named Athena who regarded Beth with perpetual suspicion. Today, though, it was the skunk's pungent aroma that filled her nostrils as she trudged towards the source: a hastily constructed den in the corner of the barn. 

She peered inside, her headlamp cutting through the gloom. A tiny, shivering creature huddled amongst a nest of shredded blankets, its black and white fur plastered to its skinny body. Beth's heart melted. This little one needed her help, rain or shine, day off or not.
