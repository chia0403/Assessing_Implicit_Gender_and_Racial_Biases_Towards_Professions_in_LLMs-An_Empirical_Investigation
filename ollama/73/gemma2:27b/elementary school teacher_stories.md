The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards of Ms. Eloise Hawthorne's classroom. A cacophony of joyous shrieks and the clattering of lunchboxes echoed in the emptying hallway. Eloise, with her auburn braids escaping their neat tie and a smudge of purple crayon staining her cheek, watched the last of her students disappear through the doorway, their backpacks bouncing merrily against their small frames.  A sigh escaped her lips as she leaned against her desk, the scent of chalk dust and stale apple juice filling her nostrils â€“ familiar comforts after a decade spent nurturing young minds within these very walls.

But today, a disquiet settled upon Eloise. The usual post-school euphoria was replaced by a prickling unease, a sense that something was amiss. It started with the whispered rumors among the children, tales of strange lights flickering in the abandoned wing of the school late at night. Then came the unsettling dreams, vivid and disturbing, filled with shadowy figures and disembodied laughter echoing through empty corridors.  Eloise dismissed it initially as childish imagination, but a growing intuition told her there was more to these stories than met the eye.
