Rain lashed against the laboratory windowpane, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Dr. Eleanor Vance’s heartbeat.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an eerie green glow over the rows of microscopes and petri dishes that lined the sterile white walls. 

Eleanor leaned closer to the microscope, her brow furrowed in concentration. The sample before her, a shimmering, iridescent fluid extracted from a deep-sea hydrothermal vent, pulsed with an unnatural energy.  It was unlike anything she'd ever encountered in her years of research at the prestigious Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.


This discovery could rewrite everything they knew about extremophile lifeforms – organisms that thrived in environments deemed impossible for most other living things. But there was something unsettling about this particular specimen, a subtle hum that resonated deep within Eleanor’s bones, a whisper of power waiting to be unleashed.

She needed to proceed with caution.
