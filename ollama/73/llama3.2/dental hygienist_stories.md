Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As she steamed the water in the dental unit's autoclave, Emily Jean Thompson couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her. It was the same feeling she got every time she saw the patient list for the day - a never-ending stream of nervous smiles and anxious faces, each one accompanied by a unique set of problems that only she could solve.

Emily was a dental hygienist at Oakwood Family Dental, a small practice in the heart of suburban Chicago. She had always loved the quiet routine of her job, the way it allowed her to focus on one patient at a time and make a real difference in their oral health. But lately, she'd started to notice...things. Little things that didn't quite add up.

The first was Mrs. Jenkins' missing dental insurance card, which Emily had to replace twice last week alone. The second was the suspiciously clean dentures her aunt's friend's daughter-in-law wore - they were almost too perfect, like they'd been airbrushed onto the patient's gums.

It was as if someone was playing a game of dental hygiene roulette, trying to throw Emily off balance with one fake or misfiled chart at a time. And then there was the new employee, Dr. Patel, who seemed friendly enough but had an unnerving habit of "accidentally" reviewing Emily's patient files while she was on the phone with her mom.

As the autoclave beeped, signaling that it was ready to cycle again, Emily took a deep breath and tried to shake off the feeling. She had 17 patients to see today, each one more unique than the last. And she was ready to tackle them head-on - or at least, as ready as she ever got.
