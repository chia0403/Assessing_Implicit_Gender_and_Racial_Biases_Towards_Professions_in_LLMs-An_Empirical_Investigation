As the sun set over the vast expanse of the Arizona desert, Captain James "Hawk" Hawkins navigated his worn-out Peterbilt 359 down Highway 87, the rhythmic hum of its engine and the soft crackle of the CB radio providing a soothing soundtrack to his long night's drive. The stars began to twinkle in the sky above, casting an ethereal glow over the desert landscape as Hawk settled into his favorite cruising speed – a comfortable 70 miles per hour.

With over a decade of experience behind the wheel, Hawk had seen it all: from the golden sunrises over the Grand Canyon to the neon-lit sprawl of Las Vegas. He knew every truck stop, every diner, and every shady character that roamed the highways like the back of his hand. But on this particular night, something felt off – a nagging sense of unease that lingered in the pit of his stomach, like a warning he couldn't quite shake.

As he cruised through the darkness, Hawk's eyes scanned the horizon for any sign of trouble, his mind racing with possibilities. He had just finished a long haul from Texas to Chicago, and was now making his way back east on his way to meet up with an old friend in New Mexico. But as the miles flew by, Hawk couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched – or worse, that something was waiting for him in the shadows, waiting to pounce.
