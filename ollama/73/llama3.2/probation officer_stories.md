As the misty dawn broke over the small town of Ravenswood, Maine, Probation Officer Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood outside the worn brick walls of Oakdale Correctional Facility, sipping on a lukewarm coffee from her thermos. The early morning fog clung to the buildings like a damp shroud, casting an eerie gloom over the deserted streets. Lexi's eyes scanned the entrance, where two burly guards in bright orange vests stood vigilant, their eyes fixed on the inmates emerging from the cells.

Lexi had been working at Oakdale for five years, ever since she'd earned her degree in criminal justice and landed a spot with the Maine Department of Corrections. She took pride in helping offenders turn their lives around, but it was a tough job – the system was broken, and the odds were often stacked against her clients.

As she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time that morning, Lexi's mind began to wander back to the new assignment she'd received just yesterday: a 25-year-old ex-con named Jake McCormick, fresh out of the joint after serving five years for armed robbery. Rumors had circulated about Jake's involvement in some shady dealings during his incarceration – whispers that made Lexi's gut twist with unease.

"Hey, Officer Thompson," one of the guards called out, breaking her train of thought. "Your first client's waiting outside."

Lexi took a deep breath and headed towards the entrance, ready to face whatever challenges Jake McCormick had in store for her – and herself.
