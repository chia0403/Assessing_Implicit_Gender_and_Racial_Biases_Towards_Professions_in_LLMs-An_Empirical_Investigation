Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an unforgiving glare on the worn linoleum floor as Axel Gustavsson pushed his cart of cleaning supplies through the deserted corridors of Ravenswood High School. The air was heavy with the scent of stale coffee and forgotten dreams, a smell that had clung to these halls for decades.

Axel, the quiet and unassuming janitor, knew every nook and cranny of the school like the back of his hand. He'd been working here since he was 17, scrubbing toilets and sweeping floors as part of a summer job program for high school students. But Axel had never left Ravenswood. Not really. It was home, in its own strange way.

As he methodically cleaned each room, Axel couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The teachers seemed more on edge than usual, whispering to each other in huddled groups during lunch. And then there were the rumors. Whispers of a mysterious new student who'd transferred from an "outside school" and was supposedly causing all sorts of trouble.

Axel snorted to himself as he emptied the trash cans into his cart. Outside schools? Please. Ravenswood High had been around for longer than anyone could remember, with more generations of students having walked its halls than Axel could count on his fingers.

Still, a nagging sense of curiosity lingered in the back of his mind. Who was this mysterious new student, and what did they want? Axel's eyes scanned the empty corridors once more, searching for any sign of movement or life beyond the rows of lockers and classrooms. But there was nothing. Just silence.

Or so he thought.
