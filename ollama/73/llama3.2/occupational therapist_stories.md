Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment, sipping a lukewarm cup of coffee. As an occupational therapist at the University of Washington Medical Center, Lexi was no stranger to the grey, drizzly days that seemed to define the Pacific Northwest's weather. But she had grown to love the quiet intimacy of her daily commute, the soft hum of the bus engine and the gentle patter of raindrops on the pavement.

Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the familiar tension in her shoulders ease as she gazed out at the city's skyline. She had always found solace in the therapeutic world of occupational therapy, where the smallest changes could have a profound impact on people's lives. And yet, despite her passion for her work, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease had been building inside her all week, like a slowly growing storm cloud on the horizon.

She was determined to find a way to help Emma, no matter what it took.

The bus rumbled to life, and Lexi settled into her usual seat near the back, lost in thought as the city rolled by outside the window. Little did she know, this ordinary day would soon take an extraordinary turn...
