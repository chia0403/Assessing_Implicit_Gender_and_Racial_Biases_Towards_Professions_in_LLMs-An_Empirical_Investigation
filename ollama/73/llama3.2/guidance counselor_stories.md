Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the streets and homes that lined its main street. The air was crisp with the scent of autumn leaves and the distant sound of children's laughter carried on the breeze.

Inside the Willow Creek High School, guidance counselor Emily Alexandra Reynolds sat at her desk, sipping a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring out the window at the darkening sky. She had spent the morning reviewing student files and planning lesson plans for her classes, but her mind kept wandering to the strange conversation she had with one of her students earlier that day.

Twenty-year-old Alex Chen had come to see Emily in tears, recounting a disturbing encounter he had with his former best friend at a party the night before. As Emily listened, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about the story - a sense of familiarity, perhaps, or a nagging intuition that there was more to the tale than Alex was letting on.

As she leaned back in her chair and rubbed her tired eyes, Emily's gaze fell upon the stack of files on her desk, each one representing a student with their own unique struggles and triumphs. She thought about all the students who had come to rely on her guidance over the years, each one facing their own set of challenges as they navigated the ups and downs of adolescence.

And then there was Alex Chen - the student whose story still lingered in Emily's mind like a puzzle she couldn't quite solve.
