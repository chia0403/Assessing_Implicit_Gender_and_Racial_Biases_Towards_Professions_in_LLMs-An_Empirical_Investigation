The fluorescent lights of the office building hummed above, casting an unforgiving glare over the rows of cubicles that stretched out like a maze. In one corner of the complex, a lone figure sat hunched over a bank of computer screens, her eyes fixed intently on the digital landscape unfolding before her.

Ava Maria Rodriguez, systems analyst extraordinaire, was a master of code and data, with a mind for numbers and a knack for problem-solving that had earned her a reputation as one of the best in the business. Tonight, she found herself working late, pouring over lines of Python and Java as she tried to track down a mysterious glitch that had been plaguing the company's servers all day.

As the clock ticked closer to midnight, Ava's thoughts began to wander from the code itself to the strange, cryptic messages she'd been receiving on her phone for weeks. The texts, sent from an unknown number, were always brief and seemingly innocuous – "Your work is noticed" or "Look again at the logs" – but they left Ava with a nagging sense of unease that refused to shake.

She shook off the feeling, focusing instead on the task at hand: debugging the server and getting back to her desk by 1 AM. But as she typed out a line of code, her fingers hesitated for a moment before landing on the keyboard, and she couldn't help but wonder: what – or who – was really watching her?
