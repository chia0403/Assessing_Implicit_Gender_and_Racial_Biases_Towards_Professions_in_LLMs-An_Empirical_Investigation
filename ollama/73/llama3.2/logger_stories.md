Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the dense forest, casting a warm orange glow over the towering trees as Jack Everett, a rugged logger in his late 30s with a strong jawline and weathered skin, stepped out of the cab of his worn truck. The engine died beneath him, and the only sound was the distant call of a loon on the lake that bordered the forest to the east. It had been a long day's work, felling trees for a logging company in the small town of Willow Creek, population 2,500.

The forest floor was scattered with tools, scraps of bark, and broken branches from the previous day's cutting crew. Jack took a deep breath, feeling the damp air fill his lungs as he surveyed the area where his team had laid out for the night. The moon was just starting to rise over the treetops, casting an eerie silver light on the landscape.

Jack's thoughts turned to the letter in his pocket, addressed to him from his estranged father, who had been missing for five years. The letter promised a meeting at this very spot, where Jack would finally learn the truth about his family's past and the reason for his father's disappearance. A shiver ran down Jack's spine as he wondered what secrets lay hidden in those woods, waiting to be uncovered.

As he gazed into the darkness, Jack felt an inexplicable sense of trepidation wash over him, a feeling that something was watching him from the shadows, waiting for him to make his next move.
