Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes that lined them. In a small backyard nestled between two older oak trees, landscaper Everett Wesley "Evy" Thompson surveyed his handiwork with pride. He had spent the day transforming the neglected yard into a tranquil oasis, complete with a winding stone path, vibrant perennials, and a statement piece of art - a weathered wooden bench with a hand-carved owl perched atop it.

As Evy wiped the sweat from his brow, he couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction wash over him. There was something therapeutic about getting his hands dirty and watching a space come alive under his care. And besides, it wasn't just about aesthetics - being a landscaper allowed him to make a real difference in people's lives, one well-planted garden at a time.

Just as Evy was finishing up the last of the touch-ups, he noticed a peculiar woman standing across the street, eyeing the finished yard with an intensity that made him wonder what she was really looking for. She wore a pair of thick-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose, and her dark hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, revealing a face etched with fine lines and a hint of curiosity.

"Who's that?" Evy wondered aloud to himself, his eyes drifting across the street once more. Little did he know, this stranger would soon become the catalyst for a transformation in his own life - one that would take him on an unexpected journey of self-discovery and growth.

How's that? I've given you a potential story opening with Evy Thompson, the main character.
