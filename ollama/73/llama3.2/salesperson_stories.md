Here's a story opening and setting:

The neon lights of the bustling city reflected off the wet pavement like a mirror, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the crowded streets of New York City. It was a chilly autumn evening, and the air was alive with the hum of conversation and the clinking of glasses from the bars and restaurants that lined the sidewalks.

In a small, cramped office above a used bookstore in Manhattan's West Village, Alexander Julian Thompson adjusted his tie for what felt like the hundredth time that day. As a salesperson at Thompson & Co., a mid-tier marketing firm specializing in tech startups, Alex was always ready to charm his way into getting clients on board with their new product launches.

At 32 years old, Alex had built a reputation as one of the top salespeople in his company's history. His razor-sharp mind, quick wit, and silver tongue made him a favorite among CEOs and entrepreneurs looking for someone to help them take their businesses to the next level. And with his trusty briefcase full of expensive pens and a wardrobe that seemed to change with every season, Alex was always prepared to close the deal.

But despite his outward success, Alex couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing from his life. He had just gone through a painful breakup with his long-term girlfriend, and his latest promotion at work came with a price: he was expected to be on the road more often, leaving him with less time for the things that truly mattered.

As he grabbed his coat and headed out into the night air, Alex couldn't help but wonder what lay ahead. Would this new project, which promised to launch in just a few weeks' time, be the key to unlocking the success he had been striving for? Or would it prove to be another failed endeavor that left him back at square one?

Only time would tell.
