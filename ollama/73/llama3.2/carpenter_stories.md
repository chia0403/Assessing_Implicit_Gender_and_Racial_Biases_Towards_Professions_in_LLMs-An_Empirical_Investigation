Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the canal, shrouding the narrow streets of Ravenscar in a damp, gray mist that clung to every surface like a damp cloth. It was a chill that seeped into your bones on a night like this, one that made you want to curl up with a hot cup of tea and forget about the world outside.

But for Thomas Edwin Fletcher, a grizzled carpenter in his late forties, there was no respite from the damp. He had spent years building houses on these streets, his hands roughened by years of hammering nails and sanding wood, but still stained with the remnants of yesterday's projects. The smell of sawdust and paint hung heavy over his small workshop, a haven in the midst of the misty night.

As he wiped down the workbench for what felt like the hundredth time that evening, Thomas couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It wasn't just the fog - it seemed to seep into every pore, making him feel restless and on edge. He had been noticing strange things lately: tools gone missing, strange noises in the night, and an overall sense of unease that he couldn't quite explain.

And then there was the letter. A letter that had arrived at his workshop just yesterday, bearing no return address and containing only a single sentence: "Meet me at the old oak at midnight if you want to know the truth about Ravenscar." Thomas had torn up the letter in frustration, but now he found himself wondering who could have written it, and what kind of truth they might be referring to.
