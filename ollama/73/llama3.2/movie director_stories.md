Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

The sun had just begun to set over the bustling streets of New Orleans, casting a warm orange glow over the French Quarter. The sound of jazz music drifted through the air, mingling with the hum of conversation from tourists and locals alike.

In his office above a vintage clothing store on Bourbon Street, movie director Julian Sebastian Flynn sat staring at the latest script he'd been hired to work on - a sweeping epic about the rise and fall of the infamous New Orleans voodoo queen, Marie Laveau. The words "New Orleans" and "voodoo" seemed to leap off the page, but Julian felt a growing sense of unease as he read through the scene descriptions.

As he sat at his desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee, Julian's mind began to wander to the production issues that had plagued their previous project - the lavish period drama set in 19th century Louisiana. The endless re-shoots, the constant delays, and the crippling budget overruns had left him feeling like he was walking through quicksand.

Just as Julian was starting to lose himself in thought, his phone rang, shrill and insistent. He picked up, hoping it wasn't another vendor or telemarketer, but instead heard the voice of his production manager, Rachel LaFleur, sounding anxious.

"Julian, I need to talk to you about the set construction on the Laveau film," she said, her words tumbling out in a rush. "We've got some major issues with the design and we're going to be days behind schedule if we don't get it sorted out now."

Julian felt a knot form in his stomach as he listened to Rachel's concerns. He knew that this production was his ticket to finally making a name for himself in Hollywood, but so far, everything seemed to be falling apart.

"Okay, let me come down and take a look," Julian said, trying to keep the panic out of his voice. "I'll see what I can do."

As he hung up the phone, Julian couldn't shake the feeling that this was going to be one production from which he might not recover.
