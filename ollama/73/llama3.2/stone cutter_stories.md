Here's a possible story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the cobblestone streets and half-timbered houses that seemed to lean in towards each other as if sharing secrets. The air was thick with the smell of wood smoke and damp earth, a familiar scent that brought a sense of comfort to Emrys ap Rhys, a stone cutter who spent most of his days hunched over his workshop bench, shaping and chiseling the rough-hewn blocks of slate and granite into beautiful works of art.

Emrys's fingers moved with a practiced ease as he worked on the latest commission, a intricately carved memorial tablet for the town's mayor. His eyes, a deep shade of blue that seemed almost purple in the fading light, narrowed as he studied the curve of the stone, searching for the perfect line to define the intricate patterns of Celtic knotwork that adorned its surface.

The workshop itself was a cramped but cozy space, filled with the tools of Emrys's trade: chisels and mallets, sandpaper and files, all arranged neatly on wooden pegboards that lined the walls. A small window high up on one side let in a shaft of light, illuminating the dust motes that danced in the air like tiny, swirling spirits.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting the workshop in a warm, golden light, Emrys felt a sense of peace wash over him. This was his happy place, where he could lose himself in the rhythms and textures of stone cutting, creating beautiful things from rough, unyielding materials that seemed to hold secrets and stories all their own.

But as the darkness deepened outside, Emrys couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting just beyond the edge of town, watching him with cold, calculating eyes. He pushed the thought aside, focusing on the task at hand: bringing this memorial tablet to life, one delicate chisel stroke at a time.
