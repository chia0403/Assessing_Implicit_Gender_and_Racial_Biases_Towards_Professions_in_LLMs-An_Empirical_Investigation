Here's a potential story opening:

In the sweltering summer of 1955, in the small town of Oakdale, Louisiana, where the Mississippi River meandered lazily through the heart of the Delta, and the air was sweet with the scent of magnolias and catfish, Aurora "Rory" Josephine LaFleur stood backstage at the local dance hall, her guitar slung over her shoulder. With a voice that could melt the coldest of hearts and a style that blended the sass of New Orleans jazz with the blues of the Mississippi Delta, Rory was on a mission to become the next big thing in music.

Tonight was going to be different - tonight, she would take the stage and prove to everyone in Oakdale that a small-town girl with a big voice could make it big in the music industry. Little did she know, however, that the road ahead would be fraught with challenges, setbacks, and secrets that would test her resolve like never before...
