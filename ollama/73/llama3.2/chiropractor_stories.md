Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Elijah Everett Harris adjusted his glasses, peering through the foggy lens to get a better look at the X-ray images on his screen. As a third-generation chiropractor in the small town of Oakdale, Illinois, Elijah had grown up surrounded by the hiss of carbonated water machines and the faint scent of cedar oil. His family's practice, Harris Chiropractic, had been a staple of the community for decades, and Elijah was determined to carry on the tradition.

As he worked at his desk, the late afternoon sun cast a warm glow through the large windows of his office, illuminating the rows of dusty medical texts and framed certificates adorning the walls. The air was thick with the smell of old books and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that Elijah had grown to love over the years.

Just as he was about to review another patient's chart, the phone on his desk jolted him out of his reverie. It was a call from an unfamiliar number, and the voice on the other end sent a shiver down his spine.

"Dr. Harris, this is Detective Jameson from the Chicago PD. I need to speak with you about a case that's been sending some... unusual ripples through our department."

Elijah's curiosity piqued, he leaned forward in his chair, pen poised over his notepad as he waited for Detective Jameson to continue.

How would you like me to proceed?
