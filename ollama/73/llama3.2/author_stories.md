Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished stone as Emilia Fothergill stepped out of her small flat on Bruntsfield Place, wrapping a worn woolen coat around her shoulders to ward off the chill of the winter evening. The fog swirled around her ankles like a damp, gray mist, shrouding the city's historic buildings and narrow alleys in an impenetrable veil.

Emilia took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill her lungs as she gazed out at the city she had called home for most of her life. A writer by trade, she was no stranger to the quiet rhythms of Edinburgh's streets, where the past seemed to seep from every stone and brick. As a celebrated author of historical fiction, Emilia drew inspiration from the city's storied past, pouring her imagination onto the page like a ghostly libation.

Tonight, however, Emilia wasn't here to indulge in the solace of words or the thrall of Edinburgh's ancient streets. She was on her way to meet an old friend, one who had summoned her with a cryptic message and a hint of trepidation that had kept Emilia awake all night. The letter, penned by the friend, Lucy Macpherson, had been brief but evocative, speaking of secrets uncovered in the city's forgotten corners and whispers of a long-forgotten tragedy.

As Emilia walked, her footsteps echoed off the buildings, weaving a path through the deserted streets that led her toward the darkening heart of the city. Little did she know, this evening would prove to be one of transformation, one that would unravel the threads of her own past and draw her into a world where the lines between truth and fiction blurred like the fog-shrouded alleys themselves.
