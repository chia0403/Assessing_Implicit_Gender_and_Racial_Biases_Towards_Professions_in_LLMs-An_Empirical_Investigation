Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty Main Street. Amidst the quaint shops and restaurants, a figure emerged from the shadows, his worn boots making soft crunching sounds on the gravel parking lot outside his truck.
