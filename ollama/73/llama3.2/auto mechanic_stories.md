Here's a story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Redemption, West Virginia, casting a warm orange glow over the crumbling brick buildings and rusty industrial landscape. The air was thick with the smell of grease and gasoline, a familiar scent that had been wafting from the streets since Jack "Hawk" Hawkins' earliest days as an auto mechanic.

Jack, a 35-year-old veteran of the local garage scene, stood outside his shop, wiping the sweat from his forehead as he gazed out at the rows of worn-out cars and trucks lined up on the street. His hands were stained with engine grease, a testament to another long day's work on the assembly line. Despite the grime and the constant din of clanging metal and revving engines, Jack felt at home in this place, where his family had worked for generations.

The town of Redemption was a fading industrial gem, once the beating heart of West Virginia's coal-mining industry. Now, it struggled to survive as the jobs disappeared and the younger generation fled to cities like Charleston or Pittsburgh in search of work. But Jack knew better than to leave. This was where he belonged – among the machines, the tools, and the rough-around-the-edges camaraderie that only came with working on your own backyard.

As the last rays of sunlight faded, casting the town in a deep blue twilight, Hawk lit up his phone, already expecting a call from one of his regulars, Joe, who was having engine trouble with his old pickup truck. With a sigh, he shouldered his toolbox and headed back into the garage, ready to face whatever repairs lay ahead – another day, another dollar, in the life of Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, auto mechanic extraordinaire.
