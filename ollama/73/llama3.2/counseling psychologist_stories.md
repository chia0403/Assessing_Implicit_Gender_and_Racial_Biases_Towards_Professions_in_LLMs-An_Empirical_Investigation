Here's a possible story opening:

Dr. Elara Astrid Thompson stood at the edge of the serene lake, her eyes tracing the gentle ripples on the water as the sun began to set behind the towering trees that lined its shore. The soft breeze carried the sweet scent of blooming lilacs and the distant chirping of crickets created a soothing melody that seemed to lull the world into a peaceful slumber. It was moments like these that Elara found solace, away from the chaos of her busy life as a counseling psychologist in the small town of Oakwood.

As she gazed out at the lake's tranquil surface, Elara's mind began to wander back to the day's events - a particularly challenging session with a new client, and the nagging sense of unease that had been plaguing her since the previous night's dream. The vivid images still lingered in her mind: a dark forest, eerie silence, and an unshakeable feeling of being watched.

The lake's gentle lapping against the shore seemed to calm Elara's racing thoughts, but she couldn't shake off the feeling that something was just beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered. Little did she know, this sense of unease was about to become a catalyst for a journey that would take her to the depths of her own psyche and into the darkest corners of Oakwood's history.

This is just a starting point, but I hope it gives you an idea of the setting and main character! Let me know if you'd like me to continue or change anything.
