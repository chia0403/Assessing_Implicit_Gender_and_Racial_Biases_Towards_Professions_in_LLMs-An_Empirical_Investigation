Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The fog rolled in off the bay, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, gray mist. The streets were empty, save for the occasional passerby hurrying to find warmth and shelter from the chill.

In his cramped, cluttered workshop on Elm Street, Jack "Mac" McCarthy, master plumber and all-around handyman, waited for the morning rush to begin. Mac had spent years honing his skills in the trade, working his way up from apprentice to owner of his own business. He took pride in his work, whether it was fixing a leaky faucet or unclogging a stubborn drain.

As he sipped on a lukewarm cup of coffee, Mac gazed out the window at the mist-shrouded streets, his mind wandering to the peculiar job that had brought him to Ravenswood in the first place. A mysterious client, known only as "The Benefactor," had hired him to investigate a strange plumbing issue at an abandoned lighthouse on the outskirts of town.

Rumors swirled about the lighthouse's dark past â€“ some said it was cursed, while others whispered that it held secrets and treasures beyond Mac's wildest imagination. Whatever the truth may be, one thing was certain: Mac was intrigued, and he had a feeling that this job would change his life forever.

With a deep breath, Mac set aside his coffee and began to prepare for the day ahead, his tools at the ready as he prepared to face whatever mysteries lay hidden in the depths of Ravenswood's most infamous landmark.
