Here's a story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stood at the edge of the small town's hospital parking lot, gazing out at the worn asphalt that stretched before her like a long, deserted highway. The sun was setting over the hills, casting a golden glow over the rows of weathered buildings and the people milling about outside. Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the crisp evening air fill her lungs as she prepared to face another night on call at Mercy Hospital.

As a resident in emergency medicine, Lexi had grown accustomed to the chaos and unpredictability of the hospital's ER. She had always been drawn to the rush of adrenaline that came with helping people in their darkest moments, and she took pride in being one of the best young doctors in her field. But tonight felt different. Tonight, a sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach like a stone, as if something was waiting just beyond the edge of town, watching her.

Lexi's eyes scanned the parking lot, taking in the familiar sights and sounds of the hospital's evening routine: the nurse's station buzzing with activity, the sound of beeping monitors and murmured conversations drifting from the patient rooms. It was a feeling she knew all too well â€“ the sense that something was off, just beneath the surface.

She shook off the sensation, pushing her phone into her pocket as she headed towards the hospital's entrance. Tonight would be like any other night at Mercy Hospital: long hours, difficult cases, and the constant hum of humanity in need. But Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was waiting for her, just around the corner.
