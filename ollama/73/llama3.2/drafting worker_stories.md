Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the canal, shrouding the narrow streets of Liverpool's docklands in a damp, grey mist. Amidst the crumbling warehouses and rusty anchors, one man stood out - Emrys Fletcher, a grizzled drafting worker with a reputation for being able to bring even the most broken ship back from the brink.

At 45, Emrys had spent his entire career tinkering with engines and schematics in the cramped offices of Liverpool's largest shipping company. His hands were stained with engine grease and oil, and his eyes were perpetually narrowed against the smoke of a thousand cigarette breaks. But despite the grime and gruff demeanor, there was something about Emrys that commanded respect - perhaps it was the way he listened to his clients' problems as if they were the only ones in the world, or maybe it was the quiet confidence with which he proposed solutions.

Whatever it was, word had spread that when you needed a ship fixed, and fast, Emrys Fletcher was your man. And as he sat at his cluttered desk, surrounded by half-finished blueprints and scribbled notes on scraps of paper, he couldn't help but feel that this latest problem would be the biggest challenge of all.

The phone on his desk rang loudly, shrill in the silence. Emrys picked it up, his voice a low rumble as he listened to the words on the other end - "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone."
