Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Opening**

As she sat at her desk, staring blankly at the rows of numbers on her computer screen, Emily Alexandra Wellesley couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. It had been three months since the Smith account went missing, and despite her best efforts to find any discrepancies in the company's financial records, she still hadn't uncovered anything out of the ordinary.

The fluorescent lights above hummed overhead, casting a pale glow over the cramped office space. The walls were lined with dusty bookshelves, filled with volumes on tax law and accounting principles that Emily had devoured by the chapter. Outside, the sounds of traffic and chatter from the nearby coffee shop drifted through the open window, mingling with the scent of stale air and paper.

**Setting**

Emily Alexandra Wellesley worked as a senior accountant for Harris & Co., a mid-sized firm specializing in corporate tax returns. The office itself was a labyrinthine affair, with narrow corridors and cramped cubicles that seemed to stretch on forever. Despite its utilitarian charm, the space had a stifling atmosphere, as if the very walls were pressing down on Emily's shoulders.

The office building itself was a relic of a bygone era, with worn stone fa√ßades and ancient elevators that groaned under the weight of constant use. Located in a converted warehouse district, Harris & Co. shared its space with a handful of other accounting firms, as well as a small storage unit rental company that seemed to be hemorrhaging money.

It was just another day in the drab world of tax accounting for Emily, but beneath her calm exterior, she seethed with frustration and anxiety. What if she'd missed something? What if the missing account had been more than just a simple error? And what did it all have to do with the cryptic message that had arrived at her desk the day before?
