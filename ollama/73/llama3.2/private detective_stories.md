Here's a potential story opening and setting for a private detective novel:

---

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle, the kind that made you want to stay indoors with a cup of coffee and a good book. But Emily Victoria Windsor, private investigator, wasn't about to get that lucky. Her phone had been ringing nonstop all day, each call more insistent than the last.

Emily's office, a small room above the crowded streets of Pike Place Market, was a refuge from the rain-soaked chaos below. She sat at her desk, eyes fixed on the phone as it rang for what felt like the hundredth time that day. Her secretary, Rachel, had already told her to ignore the calls, but Emily knew better. The ones she couldn't ignore were always the most interesting.

As she waited for someone - or something - to pick up, Emily's gaze wandered around her office. The walls were lined with dusty trophies from cases past: a faded boxing championship belt, a vintage typewriter, and a faded photograph of her mother, who had been a journalist before becoming one of Seattle's most notorious crime bosses.

The door creaked open, and Rachel slipped in, holding up a file folder. "It's the Smith case," she said quietly. "The ones you've been putting off."

Emily sighed, knowing exactly what Rachel was talking about. The Smith family had hired her months ago to find their missing daughter, but so far, there were no leads worth pursuing.

"What do we know now?" Emily asked, already knowing the answer.

"Not much," Rachel replied, handing Emily the folder. "Just a weird email from an anonymous source saying 'Look again at old Sarah's phone records.'"

Emily's eyes narrowed as she took the file. She knew that was exactly what the Smiths needed - another false lead to get her hopes up only to crush them.

And then, just as she opened the folder, her phone rang once more.
