Coach Emily Jean Wilson stood on the sidelines of the high school football field, her eyes fixed intently on the team as they ran through their final drills before practice ended for the day.

At 32 years old, Coach Wilson was in her element - surrounded by the camaraderie and sweat-soaked camaraderie of her players. She had spent the past five years building a reputation as one of the top coaches in Oakdale High School's football program, and she took pride in every minute detail, from the plays they ran to the motivational speeches she gave after each game.
