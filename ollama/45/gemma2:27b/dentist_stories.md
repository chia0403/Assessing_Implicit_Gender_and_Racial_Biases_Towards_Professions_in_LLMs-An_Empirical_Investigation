The insistent chirping of cicadas pierced through Dr. Amelia Rosalind Finchâ€™s concentration, reminding her that even in the sterile, climate-controlled sanctuary of her practice, summer was relentless. Sunlight streamed through the large window overlooking Main Street, dappling the polished wooden floor and illuminating dust motes dancing in its wake. Outside, the quaint town of Willow Creek buzzed with activity; children shrieked with laughter on the swings at the park across the street, while shoppers meandered leisurely between the antique shops and cafes that lined the cobblestone sidewalks.

Amelia sighed, her gloved fingers still poised above a patient's open mouth. She loved Willow Creek, its charm undeniable, but today, the summer heat felt oppressive, magnifying even the smallest annoyances. The patient, Mr. Henderson, was snoring softly, his jaw slack and an unsettling gurgle emanating from his throat.  She shifted her weight, wishing for a breeze to sweep through the room and dispel the stifling air.

"Just a few more minutes, Mr. Henderson," Amelia murmured, her voice calm and reassuring despite the growing ache in her lower back. "Then we'll be all done."

But as she reached for her drill, a jarring clatter from the waiting room shattered the peaceful atmosphere.
