Rain lashed against the windows of Evelyn Beaumont's cozy office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The aroma of chamomile tea, usually a soothing balm, felt acrid this afternoon. Spread out on her mahogany desk lay a stack of client files, each representing a struggle she couldn't seem to conquer.

Evelyn, a registered dietician with a heart as big as her knowledge of nutrition was vast, had always believed in the power of food to heal. Yet, lately, it felt like her patients were slipping through her fingers, their unhealthy habits stubbornly clinging on despite her best efforts.  Her newest client, a young athlete named Liam struggling with body image issues and disordered eating, weighed heavily on her mind. Could she truly help him, or was this battle one he had to fight alone?

The phone buzzed, startling Evelyn from her thoughts. It was the hospital, informing her of an emergency consultation. A new patient, admitted for severe malnutrition, needed her expertise.  Evelyn took a deep breath, bracing herself. This was her calling, after all. The storm outside raged on, but within her office, Evelyn Beaumont prepared to face the tempest within.
