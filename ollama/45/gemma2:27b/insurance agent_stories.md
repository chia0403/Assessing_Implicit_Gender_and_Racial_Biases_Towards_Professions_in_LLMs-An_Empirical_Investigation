Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Bartholomew "Bart" Quigley's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside him. The air hung thick with cigar smoke and the cloying sweetness of yesterday's coffee. Bart, his thinning hair plastered to his forehead, stared down at the claim file sprawled across his desk. It wasn't the usual fender bender or stolen bike that plagued him - no, this was something far stranger.

He lived in Bleakersville, a town perpetually shrouded in mist and whispers of forgotten things. Nestled amidst towering pines and craggy mountains, it exuded an air of melancholy even on sunny days. Bart knew its secrets, the hushed tales passed down through generations about strange occurrences and vanishings in the woods. 

But this claim... this was different. It spoke of a creature unlike anything Bart had ever encountered: a shimmering, translucent being that supposedly emerged from the fog itself, draining the life force from its victims. The policyholder, a frail old woman named Agatha Plumtart, swore on her grandmother's grave it was real.

Bart sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose. He was an insurance agent, not a paranormal investigator. Yet, something about Agatha's trembling hand and wide-eyed sincerity tugged at him. Could there be truth to this fantastical tale? And if so, what did it mean for Bleakersville, and for Bart himself?
