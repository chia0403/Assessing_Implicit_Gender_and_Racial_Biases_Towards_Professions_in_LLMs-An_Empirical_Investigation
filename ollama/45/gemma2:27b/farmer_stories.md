The rooster's crow sliced through the pre-dawn stillness like a rusty scythe. Elijah Blackwood groaned, burying his head deeper into the scratchy wool blanket. The crisp air seeping through the cracks in the farmhouse walls promised another day of bone-chilling cold and relentless work. He could already hear the faint moans of discontent from the barn - Bessie the cow was likely unhappy about the early start to milking. 

Elijah lived on a sprawling, sun-drenched farm nestled at the foot of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Virginia. Generations of Blackwoods had tilled this land, their sweat and toil woven into the very fabric of the rolling hills and patchwork fields. He knew every contour, every whispering breeze, every hidden creek bed like the back of his hand. But today, a nagging unease tugged at him. The sky was unusually bruised, the air heavy with an unspoken threat. 

He rose reluctantly, pulling on his threadbare overalls and stepping out into the frosty dawn.
