Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the neon glow of the "Last Chance Diner" sign ahead. Elias Thornwood, his grizzled face lit by the dashboard's amber light, sighed heavily. Another night, another endless ribbon of asphalt stretching under the relentless downpour. He'd been hauling freight across the country for 20 years, and the romance had long since faded. Now, it was just miles and deadlines, loneliness punctuated by greasy diner coffee and lukewarm showers in truck stops with questionable hygiene.

Elias gripped the worn leather steering wheel of his trusty Kenworth, "Betsy," her engine rumbling like a contented beast despite the storm's fury. He glanced at the clock â€“ 2:17 AM. Still another five hours to reach Denver, where he was supposed to drop off a load of industrial piping. Five more hours of battling the elements and fighting off the insistent drowsiness that gnawed at him.

He pulled into the deserted diner parking lot, Betsy groaning under her weight as she settled onto the rain-slicked asphalt. Maybe a slice of pie and a hot cup of joe would be enough to keep him going. Maybe it wouldn't. But Elias knew one thing for sure: the road called, and he had to answer.
