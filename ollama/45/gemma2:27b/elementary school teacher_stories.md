Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Ms. Eleanor Ainsworth's third-grade classroom, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves outside into an impressionistic watercolor. A low rumble of thunder echoed through the old building, making the students giggle nervously. Eleanor, a woman with laugh lines etched around her kind eyes and auburn hair perpetually escaping its bun, smiled reassuringly.

"Don't worry, everyone," she said, her voice a soothing balm against the storm raging outside. "It's just a little thunder. Nothing to be afraid of."  She paused, tapping a finger on her chin. "In fact, it reminds me of a story..."


Eleanor loved sharing stories with her students, transporting them to fantastical worlds and teaching valuable lessons along the way. Today, however, as she reached for the worn copy of "The Wizard of Oz," an unexpected gust of wind rattled the windowpane so violently that the latch gave way, sending a shard of glass splintering onto the floor. 

Eleanor gasped, her hand flying to her mouth. The room fell silent, the students staring wide-eyed at the broken window.  A chill wind swept in, carrying with it not just the scent of wet leaves and earth, but something else... something strange and unsettling.
