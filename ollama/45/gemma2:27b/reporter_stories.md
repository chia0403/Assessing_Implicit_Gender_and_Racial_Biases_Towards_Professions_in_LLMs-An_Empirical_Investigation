The humid air clung to Eloise Carmichael like a second skin as she pushed through the throng of tourists crowding Bourbon Street. The smell of beignets and stale beer hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the tinny strains of jazz leaking from doorways. Neon signs buzzed and flickered, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the cracked asphalt. Eloise adjusted the strap of her camera bag, its weight a familiar comfort against her hip.

She was on assignment for The New Orleans Dispatch, tasked with uncovering the truth behind the recent string of disappearances plaguing the French Quarter. Three people gone in as many weeks, vanished without a trace. The police were calling it "wanderlust," but Eloise knew better. This wasn't some whimsical urge to explore; there was something darker at play.
