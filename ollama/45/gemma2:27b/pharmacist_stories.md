Rain hammered against the dusty windowpane of "Apothecary & Owl," blurring the neon sign that flickered erratically above. Inside, Eleanor Rosethorne meticulously counted out lavender chamomile capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration as the storm raged outside. The air hung heavy with the scent of dried herbs and aged wood – a comforting aroma that usually soothed Eleanor's anxieties. But tonight, even the familiar smell couldn't quell the gnawing unease settling in her gut.

The bell above the door jingled, startling Eleanor from her task. A figure stood silhouetted against the swirling rain, their face obscured by the hood of a worn-out cloak.  Something about the visitor's stance, the way they seemed to hesitate before stepping inside, sent a shiver down Eleanor's spine. This wasn't one of her usual customers seeking cough syrup or indigestion tablets.  This felt different – ominous even.

Eleanor forced a smile as the figure approached the counter, their cloak dripping puddles onto the worn wooden floor. "Good evening," she said, her voice betraying none of the apprehension churning within. "How can I help you?"
