The clang of metal on porcelain echoed through the cramped bathroom, momentarily drowning out the incessant drone of the city outside. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, his forehead slick with sweat despite the chill October air, tightened the last bolt on the leaky faucet.  He wiped his hands on his grease-stained overalls, a grimace twisting his features as he surveyed the scene. Cracked tiles, peeling paint, a toilet that wobbled precariously - this bathroom was a testament to years of neglect.

Bart sighed, hauling himself up from his knees. He'd been called out to fix a "simple leak," but as usual, appearances were deceiving. This building, a dilapidated brownstone wedged between a noisy bodega and a perpetually shuttered antique shop, seemed to be allergic to proper plumbing.  Still, he couldn't help but feel a pang of sympathy for the tenant, Mrs. Rodriguez, who greeted him with watery eyes and a trembling hand clutching a cup of lukewarm tea.
