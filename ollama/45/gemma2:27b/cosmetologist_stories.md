The scent of jasmine and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint metallic tang of bleach. It was a familiar symphony to Eloise Beaumont, proprietor and sole stylist at "Beaumont's Beauty," a cramped but charming salon tucked away on a cobblestone street in Montmartre. Sunlight, filtered through sheer lavender curtains, illuminated dust motes dancing above her station, where a pair of shears lay gleaming beside a pot of vibrant fuchsia hair dye. Eloise, with her fiery red curls mirroring the colour she held, was about to embark on a transformation: turning Mrs. Dupont's tired, mouse-brown locks into a cascade of auburn glory. But as she reached for the mixing bowl, a discordant clang from the back alley below pierced the serenity of the salon. Eloise frowned. That wasn't the sound of the usual baker delivering fresh croissants. It was something sharper, harsher. Curiosity piqued, she carefully set down her tools and peered through the window onto the narrow alleyway.
