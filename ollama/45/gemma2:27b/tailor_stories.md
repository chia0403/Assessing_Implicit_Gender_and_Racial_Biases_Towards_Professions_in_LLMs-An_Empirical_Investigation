The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across Elias Thornwood's workshop, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like miniature stars. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Whitechapel echoed with the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer and the drunken shouts of sailors returning from the docks. But inside, all was hushed save for the soft scrape of Elias' shears against fine velvet.

He hunched over his worktable, brow furrowed in concentration as he painstakingly stitched a delicate rose onto the bodice of a gown destined for Lady Cavendish's upcoming ball. Elias wasn't just any tailor; he was an artist with needle and thread, weaving dreams into fabric and transforming ordinary garments into exquisite works of art. His reputation drew clients from all corners of London society, but tonight, his thoughts were far from silk and satin.

A crumpled letter lay beside him, its contents etched into Elias' memory: "Your brother is in grave danger." The words, scrawled in a hurried hand he barely recognized, had sent a shiver of dread down his spine. He hadn't seen Silas in years, not since their mother's death had torn them apart. But now, a plea for help had reunited them across the chasm of time and distance. 


Elias knew he couldn't ignore this call. London's fog-choked streets held dangers untold, but his brother needed him. He set down his needle, rose from his stool, and with a resolute glint in his eye, prepared to face whatever lay ahead.
