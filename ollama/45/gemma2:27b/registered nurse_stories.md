Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mimicking the storm brewing in Amelia Rose Cartwright's chest. The ER was buzzing with its usual frenetic energy – a symphony of beeping monitors, frantic whispers, and shoes squeaking on linoleum. But tonight, the familiar chaos felt suffocating. Amelia tugged at her scrubs, wishing she could shed them along with the weight of responsibility pressing down on her.

She'd been a registered nurse for five years, but lately, every shift felt like trudging through mud. The relentless tide of patients, the unending paperwork, and the gnawing feeling that she wasn't making enough of a difference – it was all taking its toll.  Tonight, however, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the humidity. 

A gurney carrying a young boy with a pale face and panicked eyes was wheeled past her, followed by a frantic mother. Their arrival sent a shiver down Amelia's spine. Something about those wide, terrified eyes resonated deep within her, stirring a long-dormant instinct.  This wasn't just another night in the ER. This felt like the beginning of something... bigger.
