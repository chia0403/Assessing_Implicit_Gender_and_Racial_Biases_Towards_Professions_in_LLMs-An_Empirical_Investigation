The humid Charleston air clung to Eliza Maybelline Carmichael like a second skin as she wrestled with Mrs. Peabody's bouffant.  Mrs. Peabody, a woman whose hair defied gravity more convincingly than any NASA project, insisted on "a little extra height" for the Garden Club luncheon. Eliza sighed inwardly. "A little extra height" often translated to an architectural marvel that threatened to poke holes in the ceiling of Eliza's tiny salon, tucked away on a cobblestone street behind Rainbow Row.  

Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing above the faded floral wallpaper and rows of vintage hairdryers. The scent of lavender and setting lotion hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional whiff of Mrs. Peabody's potent jasmine perfume. Outside, the clang of a trolley bell mingled with the distant strains of a jazz band warming up for their afternoon gig. It was just another sweltering Thursday in Charleston, a city where history whispered from every brick and beauty bloomed even in the sticky heat.
