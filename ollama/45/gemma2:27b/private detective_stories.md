The humid New Orleans air clung to Silas Blackwood like a second skin as he navigated the labyrinthine alleyways of the French Quarter. The pungent aroma of beignets battled with the sour tang of stale beer and the ever-present scent of jasmine from overflowing window boxes. Neon signs flickered, casting an eerie glow on chipped brick walls adorned with faded Mardi Gras murals. A lone saxophone wailed a mournful blues melody from a nearby bar, the sound swallowed by the cacophony of drunken laughter and distant sirens. Silas, his fedora casting a shadow over his weathered face, adjusted the worn leather strap of his satchel, its contents clinking faintly – evidence bags, a battered notepad, and a flask of bourbon for when the going got tough. 

He'd been hired by a woman named Celeste Dubois, her eyes red-rimmed and voice trembling with desperation. Her fiancé, a young jazz musician named Antoine, had vanished without a trace three days ago. The police, Silas knew, wouldn't give a case like this much attention – just another lost soul in the city's underbelly. But Celeste was insistent, offering him more than enough to make it worth his while.  Silas, ever the pragmatist but with a soft spot for those in need, had agreed. He wasn't sure what he was walking into, but something about Celeste's sorrow and Antoine's haunting melody played on a loop in the bar across the street tugged at him. He needed to find Antoine, not just for Celeste, but for himself.
