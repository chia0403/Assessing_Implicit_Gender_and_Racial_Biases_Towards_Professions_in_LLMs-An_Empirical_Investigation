The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the precinct, a relentless drumming that matched the thrumming anxiety in Sergeant Evelyn "Eve" Dubois' chest. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, punctuated by the occasional sharp bark from Officer Ramirez's chihuahua, Taco, who was currently perched precariously on a stack of case files.

Eve stared out the rain-streaked window at the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign across the street, a cruel reminder that even in this desolate corner of New Orleans, life went on while her investigation stalled. Two weeks ago, young Amelia LeBlanc had vanished from her shotgun house in the Treme neighborhood, leaving behind only a half-eaten plate of beignets and a chilling silence. The case was gnawing at Eve, each unanswered question a fresh wound. 

The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the cluttered desks, highlighting the weariness etched on the faces of her colleagues.  Eve knew they were all tired, their hope dwindling with every passing hour. She couldn't afford to let that happen. Not yet. Amelia deserved better than fading into the murky annals of unsolved cases. Eve straightened her shoulders, pushing aside the doubts and the gnawing fear.

It was time to find Amelia LeBlanc.
