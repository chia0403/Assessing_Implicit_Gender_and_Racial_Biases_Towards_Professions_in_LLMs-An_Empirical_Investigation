Rain lashed against the arched windows of Professor Alistair Finch’s cluttered study, mimicking the tempest brewing within him. Stacks of parchment overflowed from his mahogany desk, threatening to engulf the ancient globe perched precariously on its edge. Alistair ran a hand through his thinning grey hair, his normally sharp blue eyes clouded with worry. Outside, the storm mirrored the chaos in his mind. He had dedicated his life to deciphering ancient languages, but this latest discovery, a cryptic inscription unearthed from a forgotten tomb in Egypt, was proving more stubborn than any he’d encountered before.

Alistair's study, tucked away on the top floor of the ivy-clad Blackwood University library, was a sanctuary for him. The scent of old paper and leather mingled with pipe tobacco, creating an atmosphere both comforting and intellectually stimulating. But tonight, even the familiar surroundings offered little solace. The inscription, etched into a crumbling sarcophagus lid, seemed to pulsate with unseen energy, its symbols swirling before his tired eyes. He knew this could be his magnum opus, a discovery that would rewrite history. Yet, he couldn't shake the feeling of dread that accompanied it.
