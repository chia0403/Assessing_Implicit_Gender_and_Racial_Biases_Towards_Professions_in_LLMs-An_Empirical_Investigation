The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass. Elias "Eli" Hawthorne wiped the sweat from his brow, squinting at the sprawling lawn before him. Sunlight glinted off dew-kissed spiderwebs strung between overgrown azalea bushes. Eli's calloused hands gripped the handles of his trusty push mower, its rhythmic hum a familiar lullaby in this tranquil suburban oasis.

His clients, the Harpers, had entrusted him with transforming their neglected yard into a haven, and Eli took pride in fulfilling that trust. But today, something felt different. A prickling unease danced on the back of his neck, urging him to look beyond the manicured green expanse.
