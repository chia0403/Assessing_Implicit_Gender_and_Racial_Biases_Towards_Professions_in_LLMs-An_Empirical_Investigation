The biting wind whipped around Elara Brightshield's face, stinging her cheeks red even through the thick wool scarf she wore. The obsidian walls of Castle Obsidian loomed above her, their jagged peaks lost in the swirling grey clouds. Below, the city of Duskhaven huddled like a shivering child, its buildings dark and somber against the bleak landscape.

Elara tightened her grip on the spear clutched in her calloused hand, her eyes scanning the horizon for any sign of movement. For five years she had stood guard at this lonely post, the westernmost gate of the kingdom, watching for invaders that never came. 

The monotony was almost unbearable. But duty bound Elara to her post. A Brightshield's oath was not easily broken, and her ancestors had sworn fealty to the crown generations ago. They were guardians, protectors, the first line of defense against any who dared threaten Duskhaven. 

Today, however, a strange unease crept over Elara. The wind carried whispers, not of war drums or distant screams, but something quieter, more insidious â€“ a low hum that vibrated deep in her bones.
