The incessant chirping of cicadas filled the humid Alabama air, a soundtrack to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's frustration. Sweat clung to her brow as she wrestled with the rusted handrail leading up to the porch of the dilapidated shotgun house.  Amelia, a petite woman with steel-grey eyes and perpetually windblown auburn hair, was used to challenges – she was a physical therapist, after all – but this crumbling porch felt like an insurmountable obstacle. 

This wasn't her usual clientele; Amelia typically worked in a bustling Birmingham clinic, helping athletes recover from injuries and seniors regain mobility. But when the opportunity arose to head down south for a volunteer project with Doctors Without Borders, she couldn't resist. Bringing physical therapy to underserved communities was something she'd always dreamed of.

She finally managed to hoist herself onto the porch, the weathered wood groaning beneath her weight. Taking a deep breath, Amelia straightened her floral sundress and knocked on the door, the faded paint peeling under her knuckles.  She hoped her patient, an elderly woman named Ms. Clementine Jones, wouldn't be too disappointed by her tardiness. The humid heat and relentless bugs were proving to be formidable adversaries.
