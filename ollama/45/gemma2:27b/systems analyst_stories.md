Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Finch's cramped apartment, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. Lines of code scrolled across his monitor, each one a mocking reminder of the deadline looming over him. Elias, a systems analyst for Veridian Technologies, was drowning in a sea of bugs and glitches plaguing their latest software release - "Project Nightingale."

His fingers flew across the keyboard, desperately trying to untangle the mess before dawn. Coffee cups littered his desk, each one colder than the last. Exhaustion tugged at him, but Elias couldn't afford to sleep. Not when Veridian’s reputation – and his own career – hung precariously on the success of Project Nightingale.

The rain intensified, its rhythm a relentless counterpoint to the frantic tapping of his keys. Outside, the neon glow of the city blurred into an impressionistic painting through the rain-streaked glass. Elias' gaze drifted momentarily from the screen, drawn by the unsettling silence emanating from the apartment next door. It had been eerily quiet for days, ever since the old woman who lived there – Mrs. Hemmings – disappeared.
