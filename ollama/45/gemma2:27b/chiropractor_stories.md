Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Rosethorne's chiropractic clinic, mimicking the throbbing ache in her own right shoulder. It was a familiar pain â€“ a souvenir from years of adjusting spines, a reminder that even healers needed healing sometimes. The wind howled like a banshee outside, mirroring the storm brewing within Evelyn.

Her practice, nestled amidst the quaint Victorian houses and bustling antique shops of Oakhaven, Massachusetts, was usually a haven of tranquility. Today, however, it felt suffocating. A thick tension hung in the air, punctuated only by the insistent ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.  Evelyn stared out at the rain-soaked street, her mind a jumble of anxieties. Business had been sluggish lately, and she feared losing the clinic she'd poured her heart and soul into.
