The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow over Eleanor Ainsworth’s meticulously organized desk. Outside the expansive windows of the Obsidian Corporation lobby, Seattle shimmered under a blanket of drizzle. The constant patter against glass was a metronome to Eleanor's day, marking time between the intermittent bursts of activity – ringing phones, impatient clients tapping their feet, deliveries clanging through the double doors.

Eleanor, ever poised with a warm smile and her signature pearl-grey cardigan, navigated these moments with practiced grace. Today, however, a tremor of unease vibrated beneath her calm exterior. A peculiar email had arrived that morning, unsigned, cryptic, addressed simply to "The Keeper of Secrets."  It mentioned an arrival at precisely 3:00 PM – a visitor who would reveal something “crucial to the Obsidian Corporation's future.”


Eleanor glanced at the clock: 2:58 PM. Her pulse quickened, mirroring the insistent beat of the rain against the glass. Who was this mysterious visitor? And what secret could they possibly hold?

The answer arrived with a sharp *click* as the lobby doors swung open.
