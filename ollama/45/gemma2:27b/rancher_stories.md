The sun beat down on Elias Blackwood's weathered face as he surveyed his herd from atop Widowmaker Hill. Below him, a tapestry of emerald pastureland stretched towards the distant horizon, dotted with the slow-moving figures of cattle grazing under the relentless Texan sun. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling red devils against the azure sky. The air hummed with the drone of cicadas and the occasional bleating of a lamb separated from its mother. 

Elias, a man carved from the same unforgiving landscape he tended, adjusted his Stetson and squinted at a cluster of cows near the far fence line. Something wasn't right. They were restless, their tails swishing nervously. He knew this land like the back of his hand, and this unease, this subtle shift in the herd's demeanor, spoke of trouble brewing.  He spurred his chestnut mare, Belle, into a trot down the hill, a knot of worry tightening in his gut.
