Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Ms. Eliza Ainsworth's cramped office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her. She stared at the student file in front of her â€“ Daniel Ramirez, 17, GPA: 3.8, extracurriculars: captain of the debate team, volunteer tutor, aspiring astrophysicist. Yet, his face was etched with a despair that belied his accomplishments.

Eliza sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its bun. Her office, tucked away in the dusty basement of Northgate High, was a far cry from the gleaming spaceship Daniel dreamt of designing. The peeling paint, flickering fluorescent lights, and the ever-present smell of stale coffee did little to inspire hope. Still, Eliza believed every student deserved a chance to reach for the stars, even amidst the drab reality of their surroundings. 

Daniel's case, however, felt different. It was as if a shadow had fallen upon his usually bright spirit, and Eliza knew she needed more than her usual guidance counselor toolkit to help him.
