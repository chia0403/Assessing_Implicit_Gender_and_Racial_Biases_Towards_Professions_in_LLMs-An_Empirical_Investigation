Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Beatrice "Bea" Cartwright's office, blurring the already indistinct view of the alley behind the law firm. A symphony of car horns and distant sirens punctuated the relentless drumming. Bea sighed, pushing back a stray curl from her forehead as she reviewed the mountain of paperwork on her desk.
