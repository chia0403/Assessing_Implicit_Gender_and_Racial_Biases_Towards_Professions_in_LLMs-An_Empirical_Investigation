The scent of motor oil and burnt rubber hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume to Elijah "Eli" Blackwood. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windows of his garage, illuminating dust motes dancing above greasy workbenches cluttered with tools. The air hummed with the distant drone of cicadas and the rhythmic clang of Eli's wrench against a stubborn bolt on a vintage Chevy Bel Air. Sweat beaded on his forehead, tracing paths through the grease ingrained in his skin. 

Eli wasn't fancy, but he was damn good at what he did. In this dusty corner of rural Mississippi, where pickup trucks outnumbered sedans and the nearest dealership was a forty-mile drive, Eli Blackwood was a lifeline. Folks trusted him with their rusted relics and sputtering engines, knowing he treated every car like it was his own. 

But today, a different kind of tension hummed beneath the surface of Eli's usual focus. A sleek black motorcycle sat silently in the corner, its chrome gleaming ominously under the harsh fluorescent lights. It wasn't the type of bike you typically saw around these parts, and the rider who left it - a woman with eyes like stormy skies - had vanished as quickly as she appeared, leaving only a cryptic note tucked beneath the seat: "Fix her, Eli. She needs to fly again."
