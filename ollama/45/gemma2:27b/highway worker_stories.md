The relentless Nevada sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Montgomery's neck, turning it crimson beneath his grimy work shirt. He squinted at the shimmering asphalt stretching before him, a ribbon of black reflecting the unforgiving heat. The air, thick with the scent of tar and dust, vibrated with the constant drone of traffic hurtling past on Interstate 80.  Eli shifted the heavy weight of his shovel, grimacing as a spasm jolted through his lower back – a familiar souvenir from years spent hunched over patching potholes and filling cracks in this unforgiving landscape. Today's assignment was particularly grueling: replacing a section of guardrail ripped away by a careless trucker just yesterday. 


Eli surveyed the scene with weary resignation. The twisted metal, a mangled serpent, lay beside him, a stark reminder of the precarious dance between man and machine on these lonely highways. He could almost hear the echo of screeching brakes and the sickening crunch of metal on metal – a symphony of destruction that played in his nightmares more often than he cared to admit.  Yet, there was a perverse sense of satisfaction in restoring order to the chaos, in mending the broken artery of America's transportation system, one rivet at a time.

Today, however, Eli felt a strange unease, a prickling sensation on the back of his neck that whispered warnings he couldn't decipher. The usual humdrum of highway life felt off-kilter, as if the world itself was holding its breath.
