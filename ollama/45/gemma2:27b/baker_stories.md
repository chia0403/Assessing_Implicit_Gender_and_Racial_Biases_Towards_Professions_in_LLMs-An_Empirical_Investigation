The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized sugar and yeasty warmth, swirling around Elara Thistlewood like a comforting hug. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky outside her shop window, "Elara's Enchanted Breads," casting long shadows across the cobblestone street. She hummed along to a forgotten melody as she expertly kneaded a mound of dough, her strong forearms flexing with each push and pull.  

Outside, the sleepy town of Oakhaven was still slumbering, oblivious to the magic Elara weaved into every loaf and pastry. But soon enough, the aroma wafting from her bakery would awaken its inhabitants, drawing them in like moths to a flame.
