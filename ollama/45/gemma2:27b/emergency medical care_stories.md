Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city into an impressionistic smear.  Inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Vance wrestled with a gurney jammed at an awkward angle in the cramped space. A symphony of sirens wailed outside, punctuated by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor attached to her patient – a young man clutching his chest, his face contorted in pain. 

The air hung thick with adrenaline and antiseptic. Ellie's movements were swift and practiced, honed from years on the front lines of urban chaos. Her blonde hair was pulled back into a tight ponytail, escaping strands dampened by sweat. Beneath her weary eyes, the city lights reflected like flickering stars. Tonight felt different. The usual urgency was tinged with something darker, an undercurrent of fear that resonated in the pit of her stomach.  

As Ellie finally maneuvered the gurney past the door and onto the slick pavement, a guttural scream pierced the storm's roar. A figure stumbled from the alley across the street, illuminated momentarily by a flash of lightning.  Ellie froze, her gaze drawn to the man’s blood-soaked shirt and wild, terrified eyes. This wasn't just another emergency; this felt like the beginning of something far more sinister.
