The Grand Blackwood Hotel loomed like a gothic castle against the bruised sky. Rain lashed against its arched windows, blurring the ornate neon sign that declared "Blackwood: Where Elegance Meets Luxury" in faded gold. Inside, the lobby buzzed with hushed conversations and the clatter of luggage on marble floors. 

Bartholomew "Bart" Finch adjusted his crisp bellhop uniform, tugging at the starched collar that chafed his neck. The flickering gas lamps cast long shadows across the opulent space, highlighting the dusty grandeur of the once-illustrious hotel. Bart sighed, gazing at the faded tapestry depicting a hunt scene, its threads fraying with age. He'd been working here for six months, ever since he'd arrived in Blackwood City, chasing a dream that felt increasingly distant.

Tonight, however, promised to be different. A famous actress was checking in, rumour had it - Vivienne Starling, the darling of the silver screen. Bart couldn't help but feel a surge of excitement, hoping for a chance encounter with the glamorous star. Little did he know, his encounter with Ms. Starling would be anything but ordinary, plunging him into a world of hidden secrets and dangerous intrigue lurking beneath the Blackwood Hotel's gilded facade.
