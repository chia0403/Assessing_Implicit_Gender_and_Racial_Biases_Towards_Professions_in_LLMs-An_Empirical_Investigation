The fluorescent hum of the hallway lights echoed through Eleanor Fitzwilliam’s bones as she pushed her ancient mop bucket down the sterile corridor. The smell of disinfectant mingled with something vaguely metallic – blood, probably, from the ER down the hall. St. Jude’s Hospital never slept, and neither did Eleanor.

For twenty years she'd been the unseen hand that kept this place running, scrubbing away the remnants of other people’s tragedies. Tonight, though, the air felt different, heavier. The usual symphony of beeping monitors and hurried footsteps seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling silence broken only by Eleanor's squeaking mop and the rhythmic click of her heels against the linoleum floor. Something was amiss.
