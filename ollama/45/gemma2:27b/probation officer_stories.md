The air conditioning in Evelyn Pierce's cramped office wheezed like an asthmatic dragon, struggling to combat the July heat seeping through the cracked windowpane. Papers littered her desk â€“ parole violation reports, court orders, and handwritten pleas for leniency, all vying for her attention.

A stack of files lay before her, each representing a life teetering on the brink, each demanding her judgment, her empathy, her unwavering belief in second chances.
