The sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck, turning the sweat beneath his hard hat into a scalding stream. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by the harsh glare reflecting off the steel beams towering above him. The cacophony of the construction site filled his ears: the clang of hammers against metal, the whine of power tools, and the shouts of men directing cranes and forklifts. Elias, a man built like an oak tree with calloused hands and shoulders perpetually hunched from years of hauling heavy loads, tightened his grip on the sledgehammer. He eyed the stubborn concrete block before him, its edges jagged and unyielding.

This wasn't just any building site; it was the skeletal framework for the new Zenith Tower, a skyscraper destined to pierce the smog-choked sky and become the city's most iconic landmark. Elias, though he couldn't read blueprints or understand the architectural intricacies of the project, felt a sense of pride in being part of something so monumental.
