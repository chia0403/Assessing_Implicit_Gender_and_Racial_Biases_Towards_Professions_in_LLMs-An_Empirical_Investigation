Rain lashed against the bakery windowpane across the street, blurring the warm glow emanating from within. Penelope Hawthorne sighed, her breath fogging up the glass front door of "Petals & Prose," her cozy floral shop nestled in the heart of Willow Creek.  The normally bustling Saturday morning market was a ghost town thanks to the unrelenting downpour.

Penelope surveyed the vibrant blooms lining her shelves: sunflowers reaching for the nonexistent sun, lilies unfurling their ivory trumpets, and roses blushing in shades of pink and crimson. They were breathtaking, but today, they felt like silent mourners reflecting the gloomy weather outside. She longed for a burst of sunshine, not just to brighten the shop but also to lift her own spirits which had been wilting alongside the drooping hydrangeas near the back.

The bell above the door tinkled, announcing a lone customer braving the storm. Penelope straightened her apron, plastering on a smile as she prepared to greet them. Perhaps this unexpected visitor would bring a sliver of sunshine into her dreary day.
