The whir of clippers was Amelia "Millie" Thorne's symphony. Each snip, each glide against skin, was a note in a composition that transformed her clients. She wasn't just cutting hair; she was sculpting personalities, revealing hidden confidence with every lock she shed. Her salon, tucked away on a cobbled side street in Edinburgh's Old Town, pulsed with the energy of transformation. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing above the worn leather chairs and vintage barber poles that stood sentinel by the entrance. 

Today, however, the melody was off-key. Millie felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest as she stared at the appointment book. A new name loomed: "Lord Alistair Blackwood." The title alone sent shivers down her spine. Local whispers painted him as a reclusive, enigmatic figure who haunted the ancient castle on the craggy cliffs overlooking the Firth of Forth. What would such a man want with a simple haircut in her humble salon?
