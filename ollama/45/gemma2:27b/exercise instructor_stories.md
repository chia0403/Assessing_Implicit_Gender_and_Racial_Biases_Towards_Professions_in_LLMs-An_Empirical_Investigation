The humid Miami air clung to Emilia Reyes like a second skin as she adjusted the microphone on her headset. The bass from the Zumba playlist thumped through the floorboards of the open-air studio, vibrating up into her bones. Sunlight glinted off the turquoise tiles lining the infinity pool beyond, blurring the line between exercise haven and tropical paradise. But Emilia wasn't focusing on the postcard view. Her eyes were locked on the thirty faces looking back at her, a kaleidoscope of toned limbs, dripping sweat, and hopeful smiles. Today's class was packed â€“ everyone eager to shake off the post-hurricane blahs and reclaim their rhythm.

Emilia inhaled deeply, centering herself. This was her domain: the space where doubts melted away under the rhythmic thump of salsa beats, replaced by a shared energy, a collective joy in movement.
