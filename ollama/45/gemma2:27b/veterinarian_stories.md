Rain lashed against the windows of Oakhaven Veterinary Clinic, blurring the streetlights into shimmering halos. Inside, Dr. Amelia Blackwood sighed, her breath fogging the cold glass. She watched a stray tabby huddled miserably beneath the awning across the street, its fur plastered to its skinny frame.  Amelia wished she could bring it in, warm it up with a bowl of milk and a soft towel, but the clinic was already overflowing.

Three dogs with kennel cough whined from their cages, and Mrs. Higgins' ancient pug, Winston, was wheezing alarmingly on the examination table. Amelia loved her job, every tail wag, every purr, but tonight felt different. The storm seemed to mirror a growing unease in her chest, an itch she couldn't scratch. It had been two years since she'd returned to Oakhaven, her quaint hometown nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering pines,  but something about the familiar streets now felt...off.

As Amelia reached for Winston's stethoscope, a piercing screech echoed from the alley behind the clinic.  The tabby across the street flinched, its green eyes wide with alarm.  Amelia froze, her heart pounding in sync with the rain drumming on the roof. The screech wasn't that of a cat...it sounded more guttural, almost feral.
