The whirring of the electric file pierced through Elara Solstice's daydreams of turquoise beaches and bottomless margaritas. The scent of acetone and nail polish hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that both soothed and suffocated her. Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the bustling street, painting stripes of gold onto the worn linoleum floor of "Nails by Nina."

Elara expertly maneuvered the file, smoothing the ridges on Mrs. Hernandez's acrylic nails. Her mind, however, was miles away. She longed to trade the monotonous rhythm of her work for something more adventurous, something that ignited a spark in her soul.  She dreamt of escaping this tiny town and all its limitations, but reality always slammed her back down onto the plush, pink pedicure chair.
