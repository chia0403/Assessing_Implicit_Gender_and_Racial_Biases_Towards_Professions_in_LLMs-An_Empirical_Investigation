Amelia Winthrop adjusted the flickering tealight on her massage table, its flame dancing nervously in the dimly lit room.  A low rumble of thunder echoed through the building, making Amelia jump.

Amelia sighed and reached for her herbal tea, hoping its warmth would soothe her frayed nerves. Just then, the bell above the door chimed, startling her. A tall figure stood silhouetted against the rain-streaked window, their face obscured by the hood of a dark raincoat. Amelia's heart skipped a beat.
