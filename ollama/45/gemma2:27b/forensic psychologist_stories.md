Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the interrogation room, mimicking the turmoil raging inside Dr. Eleanor Vance. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an unsettling pallor on the steel table where Detective Miller sat hunched over files. Eleanor's reflection stared back from the mirrored wall â€“ tired eyes framed by wisps of escaping auburn hair, a frown etched deep between her brows.
