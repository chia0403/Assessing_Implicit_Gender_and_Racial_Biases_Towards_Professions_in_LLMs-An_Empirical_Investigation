The midday sun beat down on Elijah “Eli” Blackwood’s neck as he maneuvered across the steeply pitched roof. Sweat stung his eyes, but Eli kept them focused on the task at hand: replacing a section of rotted shingles with fresh cedar ones. The air hung thick and humid, heavy with the scent of tar and freshly cut wood. Below him, the quaint town of Oakhaven sprawled like a patchwork quilt - gingerbread Victorian houses nestled amongst sprawling oak trees, their leaves rustling softly in the summer breeze. Eli loved this view, the sense of being suspended above the world, the rhythm of hammer against shingle his own personal symphony.  

Today's job was at Mrs. Henderson’s charming cottage on Maple Street. He knew her well; she always left a pitcher of lemonade and freshly baked cookies on the porch for him when he finished. It was these small gestures that made Eli appreciate his work, even on days like this when the sun threatened to turn him into a human raisin.
