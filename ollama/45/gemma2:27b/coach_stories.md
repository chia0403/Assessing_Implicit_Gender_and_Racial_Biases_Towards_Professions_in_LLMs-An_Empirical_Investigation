The acrid tang of sweat and chlorine hung heavy in the air, mixing with the metallic scent of rust from the aging pool ladder. Beatrice “Bea” Alvarez, head swim coach for the Cypress Cove Crocodiles, surveyed her team with a critical eye.  Sun beat down on the outdoor pool deck, turning the turquoise water to shimmering sapphire. Bea adjusted her visor, squinting at the lane lines that rippled in the afternoon heat.

Cypress Cove was a small town nestled amongst the rolling hills of Northern California wine country, and the Crocodiles were its pride and joy. This season, however, they weren’t living up to their name. The team lacked the bite, the ferocious drive Bea expected. They moved through the water with a languid grace that bordered on apathy.  

Today was different. Today was the regional qualifiers, and Bea had one shot to ignite a fire in her swimmers before it was too late.
