The rain hammered against the frosted glass of Emilia Winthrop's office window, blurring the already dim cityscape into an impressionist painting.  Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and lukewarm coffee. Emilia, her auburn hair pulled back in a perpetually messy bun, hunched over a manuscript, her brow furrowed in concentration. The words swam before her, a tangled mess of clich√©s and underdeveloped characters.

As Senior Editor at Blackwood Publishing House, Emilia prided herself on her keen eye for detail and her ruthless honesty. She could dissect a sentence with the precision of a surgeon, revealing its hidden flaws and strengths. But today, even her usually sharp intuition felt dulled by the relentless drumming of the rain and the oppressive weight of deadlines.  

This manuscript, a historical romance titled "The Duke's Wallflower," had landed on her desk weeks ago, promising a fresh take on the genre. Instead, it delivered tired tropes and predictable plot twists. Emilia sighed, pushing away the manuscript with a weary thump. Perhaps she needed a break.
