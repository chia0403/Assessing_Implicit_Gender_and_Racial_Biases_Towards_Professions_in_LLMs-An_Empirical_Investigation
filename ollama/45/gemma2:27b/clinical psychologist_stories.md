Rain lashed against the arched windowpane of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the torrent of emotions churning within her own chest. The antique oak desk gleamed under the warm glow of the lamp, its surface cluttered with case files and half-empty mugs of chamomile tea – a testament to the long hours she poured into her practice.

Evelyn had always believed in the power of human connection, that even the most fractured minds could be pieced back together with empathy and understanding. But lately, doubt had crept in like a persistent weed, choking the optimism she once held dear. 

A new patient was due any minute – a young woman named Isabella Thorne, whose file lay open before her, filled with cryptic entries about fragmented memories and unsettling dreams. Evelyn took a deep breath, steeling herself for the emotional rollercoaster that awaited. Outside, the storm raged on, a grim reflection of the battles fought within the walls of her practice.
