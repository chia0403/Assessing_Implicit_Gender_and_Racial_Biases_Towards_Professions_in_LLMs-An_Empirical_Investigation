The velvet rope, crimson as spilled wine, snaked across the polished marble floor of The Grand Blackwood Hotel's lobby, separating the mundane from the magical. Eloise Ainsworth, her perfectly coiffed silver hair mirroring the gleam of the chandeliers overhead, stood poised beside it.  A lifetime spent tending to the whims of the rich and famous had honed her instincts sharper than any diamond cutter's blade. She could decipher a guest's desires with a single glance: the flicker of anxiety in a CEO's eyes, the yearning for anonymity on a blushing bride-to-be's face.

Today, however, a different kind of energy crackled in the air.  A man, shrouded in a heavy cloak that hid his features, stood hesitantly at the threshold. His gaze darted around the opulent space, landing briefly on Eloise before dropping again. He clutched a worn leather satchel tightly against his chest, its contents clearly precious and equally unsettling. Eloise knew, with a certainty that sent shivers down her spine, that this was no ordinary guest. This man carried secrets - secrets whispered by shadows, secrets that threatened to unravel the very fabric of The Grand Blackwood's gilded world.
