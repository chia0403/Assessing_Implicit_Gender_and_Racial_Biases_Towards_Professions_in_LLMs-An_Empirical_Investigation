The smell of sawdust and linseed oil hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias Blackwood. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windows of his workshop, illuminating motes of dust dancing above the worn workbench. Outside, the cobbled streets of Port Haven bustled with the day's trade – fishmongers hawking their catch, children chasing stray dogs, and the rhythmic clang of the blacksmith's hammer echoing from down the lane.

Elias ran a calloused hand over the smooth surface of the oak he was shaping. It would soon be the leg of a sturdy table, destined for the captain's quarters aboard the 'Sea Serpent,' a merchant vessel due to depart in a fortnight. He whistled a jaunty tune, his mind already picturing the finished piece – solid, dependable, just like the ships he helped outfit. 

But today, a shadow hung over Elias's usual contentment. A letter lay unopened on the bench beside him, its wax seal stamped with the crest of the Blackwood Shipping Company, a legacy Elias had inherited from his father.  He knew what it contained - a summons to join his brother, Alistair, in overseeing the family business. A prospect that filled him with dread rather than excitement.
