The air in the Hawthorne Library was thick with the scent of aging paper and dust motes dancing in the slanted afternoon sun. Eleanor Ainsworth, her silver braid catching the light as she adjusted a stack of Jane Austen novels, sighed contentedly. For Eleanor, there was no place more comforting than this labyrinthine haven of knowledge nestled in the heart of sleepy Oakhaven.  Built in 1892, the library held stories within its very walls â€“ tales whispered through creaking floorboards and etched into the ornate carvings that adorned the oak shelves. Today, however, a different kind of story was unfolding. A tremor, barely perceptible at first, ran through the building, causing a stack of antique maps to teeter precariously. Eleanor paused, her hand hovering over a worn copy of "Pride and Prejudice," her brow furrowing as a low, guttural growl echoed from deep within the library's bowels.
