The aroma of crayons and construction paper hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional shriek of delighted laughter. Eleanor Marie Thompson, known affectionately as Miss Ellie to her students, surveyed the vibrant chaos of her kindergarten classroom with a smile. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, painting rainbows on the alphabet rug spread across the floor. Tiny hands clutched paintbrushes, transforming paper plates into fluttering butterflies. Blocks clattered and toppled, building elaborate towers destined for imminent destruction. This was Miss Ellie's kingdom, her haven of sticky fingers, boundless energy, and unbridled imagination. 


But today, a sense of unease tugged at the edges of Miss Ellie's usual cheer.

Miss Ellie dismissed them initially as childish fancies, but a nagging doubt whispered that something more profound was afoot.
