Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the ramshackle barn, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of the storm. Amelia Thistlewick hunched over a steaming mug of chamomile tea, its scent barely penetrating the heavy musk of hay and damp fur. Outside, wind howled through the ancient oak trees that bordered her property, their branches clawing at the darkening sky.  

Amelia wasn't fazed by the tempestuous weather; it was a common occurrence in the wilds of the Scottish Highlands where she lived. Her smallholding, nestled amongst rolling hills and heather-clad moors, was a haven for abandoned and injured creatures. A ginger tabby with a crooked tail purred contentedly on her lap, while a one-eyed raven perched on a nearby beam, its obsidian gaze fixed intently upon her.

She sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her freckled face. Tonight, the barn felt unusually quiet. Usually, a cacophony of bleating lambs, squawking chicks, and the occasional indignant hoot from an owl filled the air. But tonight, there was only the storm's relentless drumming and the soft ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.

Suddenly, a frantic rapping on the barn door broke the silence. Amelia's heart leaped into her throat. Visitors were rare this far out, especially in such weather. Who could it be?
