The rain hammered against the bay window of Dr. Amelia Rosalind Finch's office, mirroring the storm raging within her patient. Amelia, with her greying blonde bun perpetually threatening to unravel and kind eyes crinkled at the corners from years of offering empathy, watched as Sarah clutched a tissue, her shoulders shaking with silent sobs.

The scent of lavender candles – Amelia's attempt at creating a calming atmosphere – was utterly overwhelmed by the musty smell of old books emanating from the overflowing shelves lining the walls. Outside, the city lights blurred through the rain-streaked glass, casting the room in an ethereal glow.

This wasn't just another Tuesday afternoon session. Sarah, a vibrant young artist Amelia had been seeing for months, was facing a crisis unlike any she’d encountered before – the sudden disappearance of her fiancé, leaving behind only a cryptic note and a void that threatened to consume her whole.
