Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Quick-E-Mart, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign into an anemic smear.  Inside, Penelope Rose Worthington, or Penny as everyone called her (except her mother, who still insisted on the full moniker), sighed and picked at a chipped nail polish. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the aisles stocked with dubious snacks and lukewarm sodas. It was 3:07 am, and the only sound besides the relentless rain was the rhythmic whir of the slushie machine.

Penny had been working the graveyard shift for two years now, ever since dropping out of community college after her father's sudden passing. The Quick-E-Mart wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills and allowed her to help her mother with the mortgage on their cramped bungalow a few blocks away.
