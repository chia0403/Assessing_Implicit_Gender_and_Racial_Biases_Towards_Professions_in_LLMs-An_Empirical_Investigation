Here's a potential story opening:

---

The streets of Ashwood were always at their most unforgiving during the winter solstice. The air was crisp with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and the sky seemed to press down on the small town like a physical weight. Amidst this gloomy backdrop, Emilia Rose Thompson trudged through the rain-soaked streets, her eyes fixed on the pavement as she made her way to the old warehouse district.

As a bookkeeper at the local accounting firm, Thompson & Co., Emilia was no stranger to the drab, utilitarian world of numbers and ledgers. But tonight, something felt off. Maybe it was the way the rain seemed to seep into every pore of her bones, or the way the streetlights cast long, ominous shadows on the wet pavement. Whatever it was, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, that unblinking eyes were trained on her from the darkness.

She quickened her pace, her hand clutched around a battered copy of W.H. Auden's Collected Poems, which had been her constant companion since childhood. The words seemed to offer a fragile sense of comfort as she pushed open the creaking door of Thompson & Co.'s offices and stepped into the warm, if not exactly welcoming, glow of fluorescent lights.

Little did Emilia know, this ordinary night would soon become anything but.
