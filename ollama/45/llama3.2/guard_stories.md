Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the icy waters of Ravenshire Sound, shrouding the crumbling stone walls of Castle Blackwood in a damp, grey mist. It was a chill autumn evening, and the only sound was the distant howl of wind through the overgrown gardens.

In the great hall below, Guardsman Edwin Fletcher Thistlewaite stood watch by the fire, his eyes fixed on the flickering flames as he went through the motions of his nightly rounds. A member of the Castle Blackwood's esteemed Order of the White Rose guard, Edwin had served the castle and its lord for nigh on ten years, ever vigilant for any sign of trouble.

As he walked, the wooden floor creaked beneath his boots, echoing off the cold stone walls. The fire crackled and spat, casting eerie shadows on the faces of the portraits that lined the hall. Edwin felt a shiver run down his spine as he approached the great wooden door at the far end of the hall, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword.

Just as he reached out to push the door open, a faint cry echoed from outside in the darkness beyond. Edwin's heart quickened, and he drew his sword with a swift, practiced motion, ready for whatever lay ahead.
