Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Sophia Alexandra Thompson stepped out of her office building and onto the crisp autumn morning air in downtown Portland. The Willamette River sparkled like a ribbon of silver as it flowed through the heart of the city, its gentle lapping against the shore a soothing serenade to Sophia's frazzled nerves. As a counseling psychologist with a thriving private practice, Sophia was no stranger to the stresses of her job – helping patients navigate the treacherous waters of their own minds and hearts.

Sophia took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill her lungs as she gazed out at the bustling streets of the Pearl District. Her office, tucked away on a quiet corner of NW 12th Avenue, was just a short walk from the riverfront park where she often met with patients who needed a break from the concrete jungle.

As she began her daily commute to the Portland State University campus, where she taught counseling psychology classes to graduate students, Sophia's mind turned to the latest client on her caseload – a young woman named Rachel, struggling to come to terms with the sudden loss of her mother. The phone call had left Sophia with more questions than answers: What would drive someone to take their own life? How could she have missed the warning signs?

Sophia pulled out her phone and dialed the number for her colleague, Dr. Henry Lee, a forensic psychologist who specialized in assessing risk factors for suicidal behavior. As they waited for Henry's call to connect, Sophia felt a sense of unease settle over her – it was days like this that made her wonder if she was truly making a difference in the lives of those who sought her help.
