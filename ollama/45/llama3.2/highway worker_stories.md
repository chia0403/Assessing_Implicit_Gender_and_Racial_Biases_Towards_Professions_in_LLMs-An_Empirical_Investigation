Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the crumbling asphalt of Highway 12, casting a golden glow over the rows of concrete pillars that stood sentinel along its length. The air was thick with the smell of diesel fuel and freshly turned earth, a familiar scent to Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a grizzled highway worker who had spent the better part of his life crawling through potholes and patching up cracked pavement.

As he scrubbed the sweat from his weathered face with a grimy rag, Hawk gazed out at the endless expanse of open road stretching before him. It was a view that never got old, one that made him feel small yet connected to something bigger than himself. He had grown up on this highway, learned to navigate its twists and turns from his father, who had worked alongside his father before him.

Now, as Hawk surveyed the worn asphalt, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A crew of workers had been called in to fix a mysterious pothole that had appeared overnight, one that seemed almost... deliberate. The road department had shrouded its origins in secrecy, and Hawk's curiosity was piqued. As he took a swig from his canteen, he couldn't help but wonder what lay beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary highway.

"Hey, Hawk! You see this?" a coworker called out, holding up a discarded piece of asphalt sample. "Looks like someone - or something - tried to dig underneath us!"

Hawk's eyes narrowed as he took in the evidence. This was no ordinary pothole.
