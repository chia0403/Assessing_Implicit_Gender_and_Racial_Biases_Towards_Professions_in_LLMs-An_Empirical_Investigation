Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had long since set on the small town of Red Rock, Arizona, casting a warm orange glow over the deserted streets. The only sound was the distant hum of engines and the occasional howl of a coyote in the desert night.

Inside the cab of his Peterbilt 389, Jack "Hawk" Hawkins sipped on a lukewarm cup of coffee and gazed out at the endless stretch of highway before him. A gruff, rugged man with a thick beard and piercing blue eyes, Hawk had spent years driving from one end of the country to the other, hauling cargo for some of the biggest trucking companies in the business.

As he pulled out of Red Rock's city limits, Hawk checked his GPS for what felt like the hundredth time that night. He was supposed to be delivering a load of electronics to the city of Flagstaff, but it seemed like every GPS system on the planet was telling him it was somewhere else entirely.

Hawk let out a deep sigh and rubbed his tired eyes. He had been driving for hours, and he knew that if he didn't get this delivery done soon, he'd be sleeping in a parking lot somewhere by dawn. And Hawk wasn't exactly fond of the idea of spending another night under the stars with nothing but the sound of the engine for company.

With a grunt, Hawk put the truck in gear and hit the road once more, ready to face whatever lay ahead on the long, dark highway.
