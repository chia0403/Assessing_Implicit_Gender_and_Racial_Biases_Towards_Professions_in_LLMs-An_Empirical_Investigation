Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets and quaint shops that lined its Main Street. The air was filled with the savory scent of roasting meats and the gentle hum of conversation from the local diner, where the lunch crowd was dwindling as the evening drew in.

In the butcher shop across the street, Emrys Fletcher was hard at work, expertly trimming a rack of lamb for the evening's special. A third-generation butcher, Emrys had grown up surrounded by the sights and smells of the trade, learning the art of cutting and curing from his father and grandfather before him. His shop, Fletcher's Fine Meats, was the go-to destination for the town's meat enthusiasts, and Emrys took pride in crafting each cut with precision and care.

As he worked, Emrys' mind wandered to the upcoming Harvest Festival, which promised to bring a surge of new customers into his shop. He had already begun planning a special display of artisanal sausages, featuring his own secret blend of spices and herbs. But despite the excitement of the festival, Emrys couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a nagging sense of unease that he couldn't quite put his finger on.

Little did he know, this would be just the beginning of a most unusual and challenging season in Willow Creek...
