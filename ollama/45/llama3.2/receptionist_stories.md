Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

It was a drizzly Wednesday morning in late October when Emily Alexandra Wellesley settled into her chair at the front desk of Dr. Sophia Patel's medical practice. The soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the waiting room, where patients milled about, flipping through worn copies of People magazine or scrolling through their phones.

Emily, a petite woman with long, curly brown hair and a warm smile, had been working as the receptionist at Dr. Patel's office for three years now. She took pride in her work, answering phones, scheduling appointments, and generally making sure everything ran smoothly on the other side of the counter.

As she sipped her lukewarm coffee, Emily gazed out the window at the rain-soaked streets of downtown Portland. The city was alive with activity, but the drizzle seemed to dampen its usual energy, leaving everything feeling a bit sluggish and gray. It was days like this that made Emily feel grateful for her cozy office job, surrounded by the gentle hum of the practice's machinery and the soothing sound of Dr. Patel's calm voice on the intercom.

Just then, the phone on the desk jolted Emily out of her reverie, shrill and insistent. She picked up the receiver, a bright red "Incoming Call" light flashing above the dial. "Dr. Patel's office," she said brightly, bracing herself for whatever the day might bring.
