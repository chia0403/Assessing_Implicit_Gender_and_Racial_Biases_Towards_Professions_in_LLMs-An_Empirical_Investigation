Here's a possible story opening:

---

The sun was setting over the dusty construction site in rural Arizona, casting a golden glow over the sprawling complex of bulldozers, cranes, and excavators. The air was thick with the smell of diesel fuel and sweat as Ryder Jackson Reed, a ruggedly handsome heavy equipment operator in his mid-30s, climbed down from the cab of his trusty Caterpillar 349F excavator.

Ryder had spent years working on job sites across the Southwest, but there was something about this project that felt different. Maybe it was the fact that he'd been hired by a mysterious client with a reputation for being ruthless in business dealings. Or maybe it was the sense of unease that had settled over him since he arrived at the site that morning.

Whatever it was, Ryder couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. As he began to shut down the excavator and start the process of loading up his gear for the night, he noticed a figure watching him from the shadows near the edge of the site.

The figure was tall and imposing, dressed in black jeans and a faded denim jacket with a silver pin on the lapel that read "T-Bone". Ryder's instincts immediately kicked into high gear as he tried to get a better look at the stranger's face. But before he could take another step forward, T-Bone vanished into thin air.

Ryder was left standing there in the fading light, wondering if he'd really seen the guy at all. But one thing was for sure: his night was about to get a lot more interesting than it had been just hours before.
