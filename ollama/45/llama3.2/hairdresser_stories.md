Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The neon sign above the entrance to "Locks & Co." creaked in the gentle breeze, casting a warm glow over the small town of Willow Creek. It was a Friday evening, and the streets were bustling with people heading home from work or running errands before the weekend. Inside the hair salon, Aurora Ruby Wilder was prepping for another busy night of appointments.

Aurora, or Rory as she was known to her clients, had been a hairstylist at Locks & Co. for five years, and over that time, she'd built up a loyal clientele of women who appreciated her creativity, attention to detail, and ability to make them feel like queens on their special days. The salon itself was cozy and welcoming, with plush armchairs, vintage hairdryers, and the soft hum of chatter and music in the background.

As Rory began to pre-rinse her clients for the night's appointments, she couldn't help but notice the peculiar atmosphere that had settled over Willow Creek. It was as if something was off, a whisper of unease that seemed to hang in the air like a thick fog. She'd tried to brush it off as small-town paranoia, but the feeling lingered, making her wonder what secrets lay just beneath the surface of their quaint little town.

Just then, the door swung open and a new face walked in, casting a bright smile over the room. Rory's heart skipped a beat as she took in the stranger's striking features â€“ piercing green eyes, porcelain skin, and raven-black hair that cascaded down her back like a waterfall of night. Who was this mysterious woman, and what had brought her to Locks & Co.?
