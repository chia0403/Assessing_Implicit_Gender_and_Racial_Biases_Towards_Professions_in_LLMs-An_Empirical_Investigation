Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the rolling hills and fields that stretched as far as the eye could see. In a cozy little cottage on the outskirts of town, a young woman named Emilia Ruby Blackwood stirred in her bed, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. As an animal caretaker for the local wildlife rehabilitation center, Emilia was no stranger to early mornings and late nights, but she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

The Willow Creek Wildlife Rehabilitation Center, also known as "Ruby's Refuge," had been a mainstay of the community for decades. Founded by Emilia's great-grandmother, Ruby, who had been a renowned animal lover and conservationist in her own right, the center provided a safe haven for injured and orphaned animals from all over the county. Emilia had taken over as caretaker at just 19 years old, after her grandmother passed away, leaving her the reins of the beloved institution.

As she swung her legs over the side of the bed, Emilia's gaze fell upon the small wooden sign that hung outside her window, bearing her family crest - a stylized owl perched atop a crescent moon. It was a symbol of good luck and wisdom, passed down through generations of Blackwoods, and one that Emilia felt deeply connected to. Little did she know, today would be a day that would test the very limits of her love for animals, and her own resolve as a caretaker.

How's this? I've introduced the main character, Emilia Ruby Blackwood, an animal caretaker with a deep connection to her family's legacy and a small-town setting. Let me know if you'd like me to continue!
