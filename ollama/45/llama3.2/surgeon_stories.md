Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as Dr. Elliot Alexander Thompson III stepped out of his luxury condominium building, squinting against the grey mist that clung to everything in its path. As a renowned cardiothoracic surgeon at Harborview Medical Center, Elliot was no stranger to the darker corners of human anatomy – but tonight, he felt like he was staring into the abyss.

The chill in the air seemed to seep into his bones as he gazed out over the Olympic Mountains, their rugged peaks shrouded in mist and shadow. It was a night like any other in this city that never slept, where the desperate and the desperate-wannabe mingled with the successful and the satisfied.

Elliot took a deep breath, the scent of wet earth and exhaust fumes filling his lungs as he began his walk to the hospital. His eyes scanned the crowded sidewalks, searching for the familiar faces of his colleagues – but tonight, they seemed to be avoiding him like the plague.

It was going to be one of those nights.

How's that? I've given Elliot a somewhat pretentious full name, hinting at his wealth and privileged upbringing as a surgeon. Let me know if you'd like any changes!
