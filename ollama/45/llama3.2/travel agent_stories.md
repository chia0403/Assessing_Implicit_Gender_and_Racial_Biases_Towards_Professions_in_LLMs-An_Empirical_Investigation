Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the bustling streets of Tokyo, casting a warm orange glow over the neon-lit skyscrapers of Shinjuku. In her small, cluttered office in the heart of the city, Emiko Nakahara, or "Emi" as she was known to clients, sat at her desk, surrounded by maps, travel guides, and postcards from every corner of the globe.

As a travel agent specializing in bespoke journeys for the discerning traveler, Emi had spent years building a reputation for creating unforgettable experiences that exceeded her clients' wildest dreams. But despite her success, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was missing - perhaps it was the thrill of adventure, or the freedom to explore new destinations on her own terms.

With a sigh, Emi pushed aside the latest itinerary she'd spent hours crafting for a group of honeymooning couples in their early thirties. She rubbed her tired eyes, feeling the weight of another long day ahead. Her phone buzzed on her desk, breaking the silence. It was a text from an old friend, inviting her to join him and his family for a summer vacation in the Scottish Highlands.

For Emi, this trip held more significance than just another chance to get out of Tokyo's sweltering heat. This could be her ticket out of the routine she'd been stuck in for years - a chance to rediscover the thrill of travel that had once driven her passion for her job.
