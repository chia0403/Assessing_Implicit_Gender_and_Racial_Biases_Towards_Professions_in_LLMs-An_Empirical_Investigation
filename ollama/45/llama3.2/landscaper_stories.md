Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a small lot on Elm Street, a weathered wooden sign creaked in the gentle breeze, reading "Green Thumb Landscaping" - the proud moniker of local landscaper, Emmett Julian Wilson.

Emmett, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-30s with a strong jawline and a mop of messy brown hair, was a fixture in Willow Creek. For years, he had tended to the town's gardens, parks, and private yards, earning a reputation for his attention to detail and dedication to his craft. His Land Rover, adorned with a faded sticker that read "Wilson's Wonderful Gardens," was parked in the driveway of the small lot, where Emmett spent most of his days surrounded by the sights, sounds, and scents of nature.

As he wiped the sweat from his brow on a worn denim shirt, Emmett gazed out at the lot, taking in the half-finished garden bed that needed tending to before the summer solstice. The once-vibrant flowers had begun to wilt, and the weeds were starting to push their way through the soil. It was going to be a long day.
