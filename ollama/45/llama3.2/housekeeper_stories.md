Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the streets of Ashwood, casting a gloomy mist over the small town that seemed to be stuck in a perpetual state of decline. Inside the grand old mansion on Elm Street, 25-year-old housekeeper Emilia Rose Windsor wiped down the polished mahogany banister for what felt like the hundredth time that day, her eyes fixed on the flickering lights of the chandelier above.

Emilia had been working at the estate of the reclusive Mr. Edward Blackstone for three years now, ever since she'd lost her own job as a waitress in the nearby town due to the economic downturn. It was hard work, but it paid well and allowed Emilia to keep her small apartment in the old part of town, where she could listen to the radio late at night and dream of a life beyond the dusty hallways and stifling social hierarchies of Ashwood's elite.

As she finished up her cleaning routine for the day, Emilia took a moment to glance out the window, watching as the rain-soaked streets emptied out into the darkness. She felt a shiver run down her spine - it was 10 PM on a Tuesday, and yet she knew that Mr. Blackstone would be awake, pacing in his study or poring over some ancient tome in the library. And Emilia had a feeling that tonight, something was going to change.

How's this? I can make any changes you'd like!
