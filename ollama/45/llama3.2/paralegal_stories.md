Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Orleans glistened like polished onyx, reflecting the dim glow of streetlights that lined the sidewalks. It was just after 5 PM on a Tuesday, and the office building where Emily Louise Thibodeaux, paralegal extraordinaire, had spent most of her day huddled over stacks of dusty case files and coffee-stained papers.

As she gazed out the window at the mist-shrouded Mississippi River, Emily's mind began to wander back to the peculiar phone call she'd received earlier that afternoon. A gravelly voice on the other end had spoken only a few words: "They've found her." The message had sent a shiver down Emily's spine, and now she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about the case she was working on â€“ or that something even more sinister lurked in the shadows of this city.

As the last wisps of sunlight disappeared behind the towering skyscrapers, Emily turned away from the window and began to tidy up her workspace, her eyes scanning the familiar layout of files and folders with a sense of growing unease. She was about to make herself a cup of tea when her phone rang, shrill in the silence.

"Emily Louise Thibodeaux," she said firmly, picking up the receiver as if it might be a call from the authorities themselves.

And that's where our story begins...
