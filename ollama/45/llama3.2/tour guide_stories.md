Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the intricate stone carvings that adorned the facade of the Monastery, one of the most breathtaking sights in all of Jordan. Aurora "Rory" Thompson stood atop the windswept summit, her eyes scanning the crowds of tourists that swarmed below like ants on a sugar high. As a tour guide with Petra Expeditions, she had spent countless afternoons sharing the history and mythology of this ancient wonder with visitors from around the world.

Rory took pride in her work, knowing every nook and cranny of the site, every hidden passageway and secret chamber that lay behind the carefully curated tourist trail. She loved watching people's faces light up as they stumbled upon a particularly impressive carving or overheard a fascinating anecdote about the Nabateans who built this ancient marvel.

But tonight was different. Tonight, Rory had received a cryptic message from an old friend - a fellow guide who had gone missing on one of her tours just a few weeks ago. The note had been short and to the point: "Meet me at the Treasury at midnight. Come alone." Rory's instincts told her that something was off, but she couldn't shake the feeling that this mysterious summons might be the key to uncovering the truth about what really happened to her friend.

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting Petra in a deep, golden light, Rory made her decision: she would meet her friend at midnight, and see where the shadows led. Little did she know, the night ahead would take her on a journey that would challenge everything she thought she knew about this ancient city - and herself.
