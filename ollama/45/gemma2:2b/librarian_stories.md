The air in the old Carnegie Library hung thick with the scent of dust and forgotten dreams. Eleanor “Ellie” Blackwood meticulously straightened a spine-creasing stack of first editions as the afternoon sun bled through the stained-glass windows, casting shimmering shards of color across the worn floorboards.  It was like holding the secrets of a thousand whispered stories within her fingertips. Ellie's heart ached with quiet satisfaction, the familiar hum of the library a lullaby she couldn’t resist. 

Ellie's world was one of towering shelves stacked to the sky, whispering voices from long-dead authors, and leather bindings that held the weight of centuries. For her, the library wasn't just a place; it was a sanctuary. Yet, a peculiar unease began to creep into Ellie’s otherwise peaceful afternoon. A chill settled over the usually warm space as she noticed something out of place – a single, untouched book lying open on a table near the window. 

**Setting:** An old Carnegie library, filled with dusty volumes and antique furniture. The light fades in the afternoon, creating an almost ethereal glow.  
 
**Main character:** Ellie Blackwood
