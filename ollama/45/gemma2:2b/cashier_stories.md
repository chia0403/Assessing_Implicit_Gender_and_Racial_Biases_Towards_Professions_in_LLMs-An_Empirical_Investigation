The bell above the door chimed, announcing the arrival of a customer as worn-down like the linoleum floor beneath her feet.  A haze of fluorescent light danced across Ameliaâ€™s reflection in the polished metal of the cash register, making her look even paler than usual. Her name was Amelia Rose Hawthorne, and she was trapped in the dreary purgatory of the after-midnight shift at The Last Stop Diner. 

Outside, a restless wind howled through the skeletal branches of the ancient oak tree that stood like a sentinel at the edge of the parking lot.  Rain was falling sideways, each drop exploding against the glass window like a miniature firework show.  Inside, the diner held its breath, waiting for the storm to pass, for customers to return, and for Amelia's weary heart to finally find its rhythm. Tonight, though, she felt adrift in an ocean of empty soda cans and stale dreams. 

"Hi there," said Mr. Henderson, a lanky man with the kind of eyes that seemed to hold secrets whispered from decades gone by. "You alright?" His voice was surprisingly steady considering the storm raging outside. Amelia just shook her head, unable to muster a response as she stared at the stack of bills before her.  Tonight's shift felt like a lifetime ago, even if it was only three hours.
