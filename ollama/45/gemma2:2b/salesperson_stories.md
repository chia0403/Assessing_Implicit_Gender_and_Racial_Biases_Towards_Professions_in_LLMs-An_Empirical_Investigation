## Story Opening:

The neon sign above "Sunshine Appliances" blinked in protest, its tired orange glow barely cutting through the humid August night. Inside, Evelyn Thorne, her floral dress a splash of color against the grimy metal shelves, struggled to suppress a groan. Another Friday night. Another dead-end lead on her sales quota.  

Evelyn wasn't built for this. While her colleagues reveled in the camaraderie of selling big deals and winning over new clients, Evelyn felt stifled by the mundane routine. She dreamt of something bigger, of something she could truly believe in, like the dusty old washing machine tucked away in a corner, its once vibrant colors now faded to a pale wash of regret.

**Setting:** The bustling city of New Albany, Indiana.  Home to sprawling factories and a burgeoning arts scene, it was a place where hope and grit collided on a daily basis. 


**Main Character:** Evelyn Thorne. A bright, optimistic soul with a rebellious streak hidden beneath layers of tailored suits and polished manners. She yearns for something more than just selling appliances in the quiet corner of Sunshine Appliances, but she struggles to identify what exactly that "something" is.
