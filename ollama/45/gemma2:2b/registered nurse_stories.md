The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Mercy Hospital, blurring the neon glow of the emergency lights illuminating the deserted corridor.  Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne, RN, leaned against the steel door of Room 302, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tried to decipher the chaotic scribbling on a handwritten note clutched tightly in her hand.

The flickering fluorescent light illuminated dust motes dancing in the air, mirroring the turmoil swirling within Ellie's own mind. A young boy, no more than eight, lay motionless on the bed, his oxygen tank sputtering with each desperate inhale and exhale. Just hours ago, he had been a vibrant soul, full of laughter and mischief, before a freak accident sent him spiraling into this silent, fragile existence.

Ellie's heart pounded against her ribs, a frantic drum echoing the incessant rhythm of the storm outside. Her mind raced with a million possibilities, each one more horrifying than the last.  Her years spent in the trenches of medicine had taught her to face fear head-on, but tonight, fear felt like a suffocating blanket smothering any hope she dared to cling to. 

The hospital seemed to pulsate around her, every sound amplified by her mounting anxiety: the whirring of the ventilation system, the rhythmic beeping of monitors, the distant echo of a muffled nurse's conversation. The weight of responsibility felt unbearable, each passing second pushing her closer to the edge of despair. But Ellie held on, clinging to the last thread of hope she had left - and the desperate need to somehow save this boy.
