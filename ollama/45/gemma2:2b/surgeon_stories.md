## The Scalpel's Shadow

The flickering neon light above cast an anemic glow over Dr. Alistair Thorne's tired face as he stared at the patient's chart.  It was his 8:00 PM round for the night shift, but the clock felt like it had spun into a black hole, sucking every bit of time away, leaving only sterile, cold steel in its wake. He ran a hand over the worn leather on his gloves, tracing the familiar lines etched from years spent wielding his scalpel. 

His operating room was bathed in a sterile white light, the air thick with the scent of disinfectant and metallic tang that clung to him like an unwelcome shadow. It was this aroma he could never quite shake off, even after leaving the OR for the night shift - a constant reminder of the delicate line between life and death he navigated every day.  

The city’s skyline, a jagged silhouette against the encroaching darkness, shimmered above, its neon glow an unwelcome contrast to the harshness of his thoughts. Alistair wasn't sure what pulled him back to this place - perhaps a morbid fascination with human mortality, or perhaps simply the unshakeable pull of purpose that had defined him since he was a boy dissecting frogs in his father's basement lab. 

But tonight, the weight of his responsibility felt unbearable.  The patient's file was thick, filled with medical jargon and diagnoses he barely understood himself. A woman, only in her late twenties, battling a rare form of lymphoma that had been spreading like wildfire through her system. The odds, even for the best surgeons in the city, seemed stacked against them.  

He closed his eyes, picturing the patient’s face etched with fear and uncertainty, a silent plea he could barely comprehend. This wasn't just another surgery; it was a test, an exploration of the very essence of life itself. And Alistair, like his scalpel, held the fate of this woman in his hands, waiting for the inevitable moment to strike.
