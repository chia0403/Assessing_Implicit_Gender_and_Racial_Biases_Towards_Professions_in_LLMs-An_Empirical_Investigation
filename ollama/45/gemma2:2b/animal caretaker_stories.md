## Setting

The sprawling estate was a silent beast in the fading afternoon light.  Wisteria Cottage nestled amidst towering oak trees on the outskirts of Willow Creek â€“ a town that smelled of fresh pine needles and hidden secrets. The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle, but it carried a hint of melancholy, like the rustle of forgotten stories in the decaying willow branches that dipped over the stone walls. 

## Character

The name whispered on the wind was **Esmeralda "Esme" Finch**. She was small and quick-witted, her auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun with flourishes of ginger peeking out. Her hands, tanned from years of tending to the animals, were calloused but gentle when they held the delicate fur of a rescued kitten.  

**Opening:**

Esme hummed a quiet tune as she surveyed the chaos unfolding in Wisteria Cottage's sprawling garden. The resident flock of sheep - a mismatched bunch with personalities as unique as their fluffy coats - grazed contentedly under a sky dotted with fading stars. A young fox cub, newly arrived from the wild and still skittish, clung to Esme's worn leather gloves, whimpering softly between bouts of clumsy leaps.  But something was amiss. 

A chilling silence, thicker than any fog, blanketed the land. The usual chirping of crickets replaced by an unsettling stillness, and even the gentle breeze seemed to hold its breath.
