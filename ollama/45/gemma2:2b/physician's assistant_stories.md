##  Setting: The Emerald City, 2087

The air shimmered with heat as it pressed against Amelia Croft's worn leather jacket. Neon signs reflected off the shimmering chrome towers that clawed at the perpetually twilight sky. Even here in the heart of the Emerald City, where holographic gardens bloomed and bioluminescent algae pulsed underfoot, there was a perpetual sense of something being just out of reach, just on the cusp of breaking through. 

Amelia, however, had grown accustomed to the constant hum, the almost tangible feeling of future that vibrated beneath her feet.  It wasn't enough for her; she craved the concrete reality behind the glossy facade. She was a Physician's Assistant, one of the few who still saw patients in the flesh, not just through digital screens.

Her current patient, Mr. Elroy Thorne, sat hunched by his holographic bonsai tree, his eyes wide and unfocused. The man looked barely alive, his skin as pale as moonlight against the vibrant green foliage that illuminated his worn lab coat.  "Anything you want to tell me about your last... visit?" Amelia asked, her voice gentle yet firm. 

The door hissed shut behind her, its faint metallic scent a reminder of both technology and humanity. Mr. Thorne's face contorted for a moment before he swallowed hard. His voice was a dry rasp, "I saw himâ€¦ the void."


**Note:** This opening sets the stage for an intriguing story, exploring Amelia's internal conflict between her dedication to old-fashioned patient care and her fascination with the unknown that lies beyond the technological advancements of the Emerald City.
