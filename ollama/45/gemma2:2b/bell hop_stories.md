The roar of the ocean was barely audible over the rhythmic thumping of the old suitcase against the linoleum floor. Arthur “Artie” Bellington clutched his worn leather satchel, its contents as heavy as the worries churning in his stomach. The salty air and the constant rumble of thunder overhead were a symphony for anyone who'd spent enough time on this dreary coast, but Artie couldn't appreciate it even if he wanted to.  The Grand Atlantis Hotel had become his lifeboat after years spent at sea, ever-shifting like the tide itself. 

This particular storm was especially cruel. It lashed against the windows of room 202 with a fury that threatened to break through and swallow Artie whole. The hotel's once-proud facade now resembled a crumbling monument, its golden paint peeling under the unforgiving glare of the wind.  As Artie adjusted his battered fedora, the flickering gaslight illuminating the worn linoleum revealed a lone, forgotten message scrawled on the bottom of the door: "For Miss Elsie Thorne". A pang of something akin to hope tugged at Artie's heart; it was just another mystery, another chance to unravel a puzzle in this chaotic tapestry. 

Artie had never been one for puzzles.  He preferred his life simple, like the rhythm of carrying luggage and serving the fleeting clientele of the Grand Atlantis. But something about Miss Elsie Thorne’s letter – with its cryptic words and swirling ink blots – had drawn him in, leaving him yearning to unravel her secrets, a secret he was certain only he could decipher.
