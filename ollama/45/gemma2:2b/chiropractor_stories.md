## Setting the Stage

The aroma of pine needles and damp earth hung thick in the air as Dr. Amelia Rose adjusted her worn leather satchel on the back of her chair.  Her clinic, nestled deep within the wooded hollows of Oregonâ€™s Cascade Mountains, had become an oasis of calm amidst the ever-growing chaos of city life. Sunlight filtered through towering Douglas Fir trees, casting intricate patterns of light and shadow across her exam room.  

**Story Opening:** 

The door creaked open, a familiar groan echoing in the otherwise silent sanctuary. A young woman with weary eyes and shoulders slumped under the weight of exhaustion stepped inside, dragging her worn suitcase behind her. She looked up at Dr. Rose, a flicker of hope dancing in her tired brown eyes.  "Dr. Rose," she said softly, her voice barely above a whisper. "I need help."
