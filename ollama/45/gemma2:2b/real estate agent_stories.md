The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Hayes like a second skin as she surveyed the dilapidated Victorian on Mulberry Street.  It was more than just a house; it was a monument to faded dreams and unspoken secrets. The peeling paint of the once-pristine façade seemed to weep with the past, mirroring Amy's own weariness from years of chasing after "fixer-uppers" with little success. This time, however, something about this place pulsed with an unsettling energy that set her pulse racing.  

The year was 1927. The Great Depression had choked the city of New Haven, leaving its once thriving business district to dust and decay. Amy found herself navigating these forgotten alleys and deserted lots, a lone lighthouse in a storm-tossed sea of financial hardship.   Yet, for all this hardship, life still simmered beneath the surface – whispers of hope, echoes of laughter, the ghosts of families who once called these streets home. It was a city struggling to breathe again, and Amy was determined to help it find its voice. 

As she stepped across the threshold of this old Victorian's worn-out entryway,  she felt an unexpected chill that sent shivers down her spine. The air was thick with dust motes dancing in the afternoon light filtering through the grimy windows; a faint scent of woodsmoke lingered in the air. Something about the place, however, whispered to Amy – and she couldn't help but feel there was more to this story than met the eye.
