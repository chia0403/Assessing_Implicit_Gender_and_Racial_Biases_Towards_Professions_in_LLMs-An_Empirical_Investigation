The fluorescent hum of the North Tower's elevators was the soundtrack to Elias "Eli" Thorne's life. Every day at precisely 3:15 AM, as his worn-out sneakers hit the metal floor of the lobby, he embarked on his silent symphony through the vast, empty hallways. The air in those pre-dawn hours held a tangible weight, thick with stale coffee and the ghost of dreams yet to be realized. His job was mundane, an anonymous shadow gliding between rows of mahogany desks and chrome conference tables, sweeping up forgotten crumbs and collecting lost items: misplaced pens, shattered glass from late-night brainstorming sessions, and the occasional crumpled receipt that held a faint whisper of a financial scandal.

He’d always thought he was just another cog in the machine of this city's ambition, yet tonight, he found himself oddly drawn to a stray object: a silver locket nestled between two dusty stacks of blueprints. It whispered of secrets and desires hidden within its depths.
