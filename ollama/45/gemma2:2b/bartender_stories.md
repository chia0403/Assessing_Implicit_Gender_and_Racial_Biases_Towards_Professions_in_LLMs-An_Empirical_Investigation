## Setting the Scene:

The **Copper Crow Saloon**, nestled deep within the cobblestoned heart of Old Havenport, hummed with the usual symphony of clinking glasses, boisterous laughter, and whispered secrets. Rain pattered against the grimy windows, turning the street outside into a grey canvas for dancing puddles. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale ale and simmering resentment â€“ a familiar cocktail to bartender **Emery Blackwood**. 

Emery wasn't your typical barkeep. His wild curls were more often found plastered with grime than neatly combed, and his eyes, usually alight with mischief, held a weariness as deep as the cellar below. He was more of an observer than an entertainer, taking in the ebb and flow of human drama playing out on his watch while meticulously polishing glasses. Tonight, however, felt different. 

A woman sat at the bar, her shadow lengthening against the worn oak.  Her name was Anya Petrov, and she looked like a storm cloud about to break, and Emery knew it meant trouble.
