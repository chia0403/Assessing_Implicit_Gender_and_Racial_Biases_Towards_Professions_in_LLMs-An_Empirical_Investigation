##  Story Opening

**Setting:** A shimmering expanse of desert stretches before Amelia Thorne, its golden sands rippling under the relentless Arizona sun. The lone figure of the woman, clad in her weathered flight suit, leans against the tail fin of the vintage Cessna 172, a storm brewing on the horizon. The air vibrates with an electric anticipation. A lone crow calls out overhead, mirroring the silent tension that hangs thick like dust motes in the sun-bleached sky.

**Character:** Amelia Thorne.  Sheâ€™s been flying since she was old enough to sit behind the yoke of a tiny Cessna. Years spent battling headwinds and treacherous canyons have honed her into a master of the skies, yet she's still haunted by the memory of that fateful day - the one where the world tilted on its axis and shattered under a crimson sky.


**Opening Lines:** "The desert knows secrets," Amelia whispered, tracing the scars etched onto the wings of the plane with a calloused thumb. "And it holds them close like a tight fist around your heart."  A low rumble echoed from within the plane's belly, punctuated by a shuddering vibration as she started the engine.  Her eyes, however, held no fear; only a determined gleam that mirrored the storm brewing above. Today, Amelia would seek answers, and if the desert refused to speak, it would pay dearly for its silence.
