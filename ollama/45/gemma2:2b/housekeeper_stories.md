Rain lashed against the grand, arched windows of Blackwood Manor, each drop drumming a frantic rhythm on the thick glass. Inside, the air hung heavy with an oppressive silence punctuated only by the crackling fire in the stone fireplace and the occasional rustle of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's worn cleaning cloth as she moved through the cavernous house.  

Born and raised in humble circumstances, Amy had always viewed her work at Blackwood Manor as a steppingstone to something more – a chance to earn enough money for a small cottage with her own garden and maybe even a few chickens. Yet, years of scrubbing floors, polishing silver, and chasing stray cats felt like a never-ending cycle of drudgery. 

The manor's current occupant, Lord Frederick Blackwood himself, was an enigma shrouded in rumors and speculation. Whispers in the village claimed he suffered from a peculiar illness, one that kept him physically frail but mentally sharp.  His aloofness only added to the mystery. Amy had glimpsed him occasionally, his gaunt face framed by unruly grey hair, gazing out of his study window as if peering into some distant world beyond their shared walls. 

But tonight, something was different. The air crackled with a tension that sent shivers down Amy’s spine. Tonight, she felt the presence of a secret, a hidden story waiting to be discovered.
