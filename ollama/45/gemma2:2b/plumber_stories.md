Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Stanley "Stinky" Sullivan's van as he navigated the treacherous back alleys of New Orleans. The humidity clung to him like sweat in a sauna.  The year was 1958, and the air hung thick with both the stench of the city and the promise of Mardi Gras excitement. Stinky was already buried in blueprints, his calloused hands tracing imaginary pipe routes on a dusty piece of cardboard. His latest job: replacing the faulty sewage lines at the legendary French Quarter saloon "The Drunken Pelican." 

A voice cut through the rhythmic patter of rain, a gruff growl tinged with desperation. "Stinky? You got a minute?"  It was Mama Marie, his neighbor and confidante, her wrinkled face visible in the dim light of the porch lamp.  "They're closing in, my boy. This place ain't lookin' pretty."
