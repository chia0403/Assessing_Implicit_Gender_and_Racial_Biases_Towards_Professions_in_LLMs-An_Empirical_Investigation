##  Setting: The Neon Heartbeat of New Eden

Rain lashed against the cracked windows of "The Rusty Chord," its rhythmic drumming echoing the weary sigh that escaped Elara's throat as she stared at her reflection in the chipped mirror hanging above the stage. A storm, they said, had raged for three days straight; but here, within the smoky haze and flickering neon lights of New Eden, it felt like a personal tempest was brewing inside her too. 

Elara "Echo" Davies, with her cascading auburn hair and eyes as blue as the city's underbelly after a particularly vibrant sunset, wasn't just another singer in this town that never slept.  Every song she sang seemed to hold within it the echoes of lives lived and lost, the bittersweet memories of love found and love let go. Tonight, however, something felt different. 

Tonight, she was performing for "The Voice," a competition promising fame and fortune to the city's most promising artists. The stage lights promised her anything but the storm brewing within; they promised a chance to finally break free from the chains of doubt that had bound her voice for years. But as she gripped the microphone stand like a lifeline, a single tear slid down her cheek, reflecting the neon heart of the city, both beating fast and filled with silent despair.
