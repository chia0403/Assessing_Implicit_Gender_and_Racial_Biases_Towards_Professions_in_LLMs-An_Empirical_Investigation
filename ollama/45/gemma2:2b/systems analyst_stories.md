The whirring of servers was a constant hum in Amelia "Amy" Chen's ears. Her eyes darted between the glowing screens like she was searching for answers to riddles hidden in binary code.

But here, amongst the humming servers and flickering monitors, Amy felt lost in a labyrinth of code.  Her usual confidence was evaporating as she grappled with the program's seemingly impossible glitch.
