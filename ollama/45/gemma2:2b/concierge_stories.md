The rain drummed against the glass roof of the Grand Astoria Hotel like a thousand tiny fists, each tap echoing off the polished marble floors and leaving behind streaks of silver in its wake. Inside, the air hung heavy with the cloying scent of lilies and old money, the usual cocktail of luxury and desperation that clung to the grand facade of the hotel. 

My name is Celeste Beaumont, though most call me 'Celine.' As concierge at the Grand Astoria, I was tasked not just with welcoming guests but also with smoothing over the anxieties of their stay, a delicate dance between keeping them comfortable and concealing the crumbling foundations beneath. The hotel was a monument to a bygone era – ornate chandeliers hung heavy, their golden glow muted against the faded velvet drapes - each room a testament to wealth that had once been palpable, now mere whispers of forgotten grandeur.  

Tonight, however, a new kind of energy buzzed under the floorboards. A sharp woman in a fur coat and scarlet lipstick had entered, her aura as cold and sharp as a diamond. Her name was Anya Volkov, and she was not here to enjoy the hotel's offerings but rather to unravel its secrets. As I watched from behind the polished mahogany desk, a shiver danced down my spine. Tonight, the Astoria wasn’t just facing storms; it was about to face something far more unsettling.
