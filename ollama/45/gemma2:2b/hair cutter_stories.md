The aroma of lavender shampoo mingled with the metallic tang of old blood that clung to the worn wooden floorboards of "Cut & Curl".  This was no ordinary barbershop; it belonged to Evelyn Delacroix, whose sharp scissors and even sharper wit had kept the bustling streets of Montmartre alive for over two decades. 

Evelyn’s hands moved across a canvas of freshly washed blonde hair, her movements practiced and sure as she sculpted an intricate side braid around the head of a young woman named Camille.  The air hummed with the chatter of customers waiting for their turn: a gossip-happy grandmother reminiscing about her late husband’s flamboyant moustache; a nervous student clutching a crumpled flyer from the Paris Conservatory; and a street performer, his hands adorned with intricate tattoos, eager to show off his new style as he waited for his trim. 

But tonight was different.  Tonight, the air felt thick, expectant, and a familiar tension crackled in the space between Evelyn and her regulars. It wasn’t just the usual bustle of life in Montmartre; this was something else, something that whispered on the edges of their conversations like the last notes of a fading song.
