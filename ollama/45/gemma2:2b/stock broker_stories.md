## The Eleventh Floor's Weight

**Setting:** Manhattan, 2035. High-rises pierce the smog-choked sky, reflecting the neon lights of the city below like shards of broken glass.  The year is now, and Wall Street has become an algorithmic jungle - data streams flowing like rivers, algorithms churning like gears in a giant machine. 

**Main Character:** Arthur Sterling. 

He was once known as "The Ace" on this floor, known for his ability to predict the market's next move with uncanny accuracy. His face, etched with lines and fatigue despite his youthful appearance, held a stoic expression, betraying years of relentless work at the eleventh floor of the sprawling Titan Tower. 

Arthur stepped onto the polished marble of his office, the air thick with the scent of stale coffee and unspoken anxieties. The weight of his decisions - billions in fortunes, lives built upon speculation - pressed down on him like a physical burden. A faint hum resonated from an advanced holographic projector mounted on the wall, showcasing market data flowing across its surface. 

Today was different.  A wave of unease washed over Arthur. His usual calm had been replaced by a nagging sense of fear, an instinct that whispered something he couldn't quite decipher. The algorithm seemed off, its predictions jittery and erratic, like the stock price on the floor before a bomb dropped.  His gaze fell to the clock: 10:02 AM. He was late.
