Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Thorne's gut. Outside, the Parisian streets shimmered with an oily sheen under the dim streetlights. Inside, the air was thick with stale coffee and even thicker tension. The room, usually a sanctuary of law books and legal treatises, felt suffocating in its hushed stillness. 

Amelia, her name now synonymous with tenacity and courtroom battles, sat opposite her client, a man whose life lay on the line.
