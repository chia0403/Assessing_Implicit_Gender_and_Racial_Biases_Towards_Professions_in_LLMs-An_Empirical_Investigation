The rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of my office, each drop a tiny drum solo in the symphony of despair that was 1948 New York City.  I, Theodore "Teddy" Finch, sat at my worn mahogany desk, swirling the dregs of lukewarm coffee. The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and the sweet scent of cheap perfume – a cocktail I hoped wouldn't remind me too much of the heartbreak in my heart, but that usually did just fine.  

My latest case file lay open on the desk: "Case #478 - Missing Heir."  A woman, Ms. Vivian Thorne, had hired me to find her son, Julian, a young man whose disappearance was as enigmatic as it was tragic. She claimed he'd simply vanished from his family estate in the heart of upstate New York a week before his 21st birthday, leaving behind nothing but empty champagne glasses and an unnaturally silent house.

The Thorne family fortune had been built on secrets – whispers of shady dealings and whispered rumors that Julian had something to do with it all. It was a tangled web of privilege and deceit, and I, Teddy Finch, was determined to untangle the threads.  I took a deep breath, swirling the coffee again, its lukewarm warmth searing my tongue like an apology. 

"Another missing man, another lost cause," I muttered under my breath. "Or is this one... something more?"


**Setting:** A cramped and dingy office in Harlem, New York City, 1948. The building's exterior leans heavily on the worn wood of a weathered door with peeling paint, while an ornate but faded brass sign hangs above the entrance - 'Finch Investigations'.
