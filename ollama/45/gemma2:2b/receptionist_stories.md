The whirring of the fluorescent lights in the cramped reception area was almost as constant as the pounding heart Amelia felt against her ribs. She perched on the edge of the worn-out sofa, eyes scanning the clock's hypnotic tick-tock. 7:05 PM, to be precise.  "Mr. Davies?" she muttered, a note of panic creeping into her voice. "He should be here by now, right?"

The air hung thick with the scent of old coffee and stale ambition in this corner office building nestled between a dusty laundromat and a struggling vintage bookstore. Amelia, known to everyone as "Amy" or even just "Missy," had been working as a receptionist for two years at Davies & Sons Law Firm. It was her safe haven, if only by the sheer lack of anything else exciting happening in this quiet corner of Seattle's ever-busy business district.

Her fingers tapped impatiently against the desk, its surface slick with coffee rings and long forgotten cigarette ashes. Across from her, Mr. Davies, a man as imposing and enigmatic as a storm cloud, was supposed to arrive any minute for his weekly meeting with Mrs. Jenkins. A woman who whispered tales of stolen fortunes and shady backroom deals, Amelia often found herself wishing she knew more about the world beyond the dusty files and the legal jargon that permeated her days.
