The air hung thick and heavy with humidity, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne like a second skin as she stood before the colossal gates of the ancient city of Althea.  It was 9:00 am on a stifling day in the heart of summer, and already the oppressive heat of the Anatolian sun had begun its relentless assault. She adjusted her worn khaki shirt, the familiar fabric cool against her skin, then checked her watch – 15 minutes past schedule, which meant thirty more to get those tour groups flowing through the city.  

Amy was a veteran tour guide in Althea, with years of navigating its winding streets and sharing stories of its rich history.  She loved the city; the feel of the centuries-old stone beneath her feet, the scent of spices carried on the wind from nearby markets – it all felt like home. 

The crowd behind her, a mix of excited tourists and curious locals, shuffled impatiently, their cameras flashing in anticipation. Amy knew each of these faces, their hopes for Althea's legendary wonders reflected in their eyes.  She smiled, offering a reassuring wave to the children, whose eyes widened at the sight of the imposing palace gates. Today was going to be a good day.
