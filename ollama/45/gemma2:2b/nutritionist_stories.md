The sun beat down on Dr. Iris Van Derlyck’s shoulders as she navigated the bustling farmers market, her wicker basket overflowing with fresh ingredients for her afternoon clinic. The air was thick with the sweet scent of ripening tomatoes and the tang of freshly baked bread, but Iris felt a knot of dread twisting in her stomach.  It wasn't just the impending downpour threatening to turn her carefully selected produce into soggy mush; it was the reason she’d been dragged here against her will.

Iris Van Derlyck, renowned nutritionist and owner of “Nourish & Bloom,” had always taken a holistic approach to health. She believed in whole foods, mindful eating, and the power of community gardens to nourish both body and soul. But today,  she found herself at the mercy of a whirlwind of emotions – anger, frustration, disappointment, and an unexpected sliver of hope. 

The setting was a chaotic symphony of sights and sounds; brightly dressed locals haggling over produce, children chasing pigeons in the dappled sunlight, and a cacophony of music from a nearby band. The market itself felt like a microcosm of life – vibrant, full of life, but with an undercurrent of uncertainty.

Iris’s focus shifted to her most prized possession - a vintage red enamel suitcase that held not only her nutrition textbooks but also the key to unlocking a deeply personal secret she wasn't sure she was ready to share with anyone, least of all her patients and colleagues.
