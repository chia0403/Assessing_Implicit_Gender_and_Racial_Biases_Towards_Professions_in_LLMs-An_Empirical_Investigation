The whirring of the high-speed handpiece filled Amelia's ears with an almost hypnotic tune as she worked on Ms. Henderson’s gums. It was the usual routine for her – a quick clean and polish, some X-rays to check for anything sinister, but this time there was an undercurrent of unease humming beneath the surface like a stubborn sugar stain.  The usually jovial Ms. Henderson's face had grown ashen, her eyes clouded with a fear that Amelia knew too well.

**Setting:** The cozy atmosphere of Dr. Evans’ dental practice, nestled in the heart of a bustling suburbian town. 
   * **Time:** A late afternoon in October, with the last rays of sunlight filtering through the windowpanes.  
   * **Sound:** The gentle clatter of sterilized instruments and the hushed conversation of patients and staff punctuated by Dr. Evans’ occasional, reassuringly-calm pronouncements.


**Main character:** Amelia Taylor, a 32-year-old dental hygienist who possessed an uncanny ability to read human anxieties with more accuracy than even her sharpest tools.
