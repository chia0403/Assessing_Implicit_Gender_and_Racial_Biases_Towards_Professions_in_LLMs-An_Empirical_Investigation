The asphalt stretched before Elias like a ribbon under the merciless August sun, shimmering with heat waves that danced across its surface. Dust devils kicked up in the distance, swirling lazy circles around the lone service truck parked near the bend in Highway 57.  Elias wiped his brow with the back of his hand, leaving streaks of sweat that mirrored the grit in his eyes. It was the kind of day that could make a man feel as worn down as the old pickup he drove, a beat-up behemoth he called “Betsy.”

His name was Elias Pierce, and for the past five years, he’d been building this highway, inch by aching inch, under the watchful eyes of both nature and his foreman, a gruff man named Hank who seemed to know every crack in the earth and every rustle in the wind.  But now, with the scorching heat rising above him like a phantom, Elias felt strangely alone. He'd spent the last few hours patching potholes, each one a testament to the weight of his purpose –  a solitary dance with time and gravity that only he could truly witness.
