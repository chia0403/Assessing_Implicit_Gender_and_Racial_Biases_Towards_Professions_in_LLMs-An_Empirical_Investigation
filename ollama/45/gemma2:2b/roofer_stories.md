The wind whipped off the rooftops of Salt Marsh town like an angry fist, stinging Elias Thorne's face as he climbed. His worn leather work boots clung to the slick metal ladder with practiced ease, his calloused hands gripping the rungs with a vice-like grip.  From this height, Salt Marsh was a tapestry woven from emerald green fields and sapphire blue water, dotted with brightly painted cottages like candy scattered across a playground. But Elias’s gaze was fixed on the stark white house at the edge of town, the one he'd been sent to fix. 

Elias Thorne, son of a master roofer himself, had inherited more than just a skill for wielding a hammer and ladder – he’d inherited his father’s stoicism, his unwavering focus in the face of a storm, and a deep-rooted love for Salt Marsh's simple charm.  Yet this storm felt different; it was a tempest not only of wind and rain, but also of doubt that gnawed at Elias's gut. He'd taken on the job out of necessity – to keep a roof over his head and pay the bills – but even as he ascended, the weight of responsibility pressed him down.  This wasn’t just fixing a leak; it was a chance for something more.
