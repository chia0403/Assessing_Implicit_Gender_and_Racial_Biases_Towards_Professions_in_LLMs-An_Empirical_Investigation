The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile, pallid glow on the chipped linoleum floor. The faint scent of antiseptic hung in the air, punctuated by the occasional sharp sting of rubbing alcohol. This was Harmony Finch's domain â€“ Room 3B at St. Jude's General Hospital, a space where anxieties ran high and needles held the power to both comfort and fear.  

Harmony, her name as contradictory as her profession, had a knack for calming even the most anxious patients. Her gentle voice and warm smile were a beacon in this often-drab world of blood draws and medical jargon. Today, however, a different kind of anxiety gnawed at her. It wasn't the usual pre-shift jitters, nor was it fear of an angry patient. No, today it was something deeper, a personal shadow lurking just beyond the periphery of her focus.  

The clock ticked down to 8:00 AM, the start of her shift, and with it, the beginning of a day that promised both routine and unforeseen challenges.
