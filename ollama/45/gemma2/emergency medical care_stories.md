The sirens wailed a discordant symphony, their piercing cries echoing off the steel and glass canyons of Manhattan. Amelia "Amy"  Grace Harper, heart pounding in time with the siren's wail, gripped the steering wheel tighter. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the already chaotic cityscape into an impressionistic painting of red and yellow taillights and neon reflections. 

Amy, a seasoned EMT with five years under her belt, knew this city like the back of her hand. She could navigate its arteries blindfolded, predict the snarls in traffic before they formed, and gauge the severity of a situation just from the wail of a distant siren. But tonight, something felt different.  

The call came in as a "possible cardiac arrest" at the abandoned warehouse district near Pier 14. Amy had never been to that part of town, and even her GPS seemed unsure of its route. The dispatcher's voice was clipped, urgent, hinting at something more than just another routine emergency. A chill snaked down Amy's spine as she pressed harder on the gas pedal, her mind already racing through worst-case scenarios. 


The warehouse district loomed before her, a desolate landscape of crumbling brick and boarded-up windows, shrouded in an unsettling silence. The rain had intensified, turning the cobblestone streets into slick, treacherous paths. As Amy's ambulance navigated the narrow alleys, the only light came from her headlights, casting long, distorted shadows that danced like phantoms against the looming walls. 


A knot of dread tightened in Amy's stomach. This wasn't just another call; this felt like the beginning of something far more dangerous.
