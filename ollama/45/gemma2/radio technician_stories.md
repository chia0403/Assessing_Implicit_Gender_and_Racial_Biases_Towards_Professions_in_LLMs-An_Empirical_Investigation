The air crackled with static, punctuated by snatches of forgotten melodies and the frantic, garbled voice of a late-night DJ.  Eleanor "Ellie" Bellweather hunched over her workbench, a tangle of wires snaking across its surface like metallic vines. A half-eaten tuna sandwich sat precariously on a dusty stack of manuals beside a sputtering oscilloscope. The smell of solder and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort in Ellie's cluttered workshop tucked away in the shadowy back alley of New Orleans. 

A rhythmic thumping, like a giant heartbeat, began to emanate from a vintage Zenith radio on the table, its chrome casing gleaming under the dim fluorescent light. Ellie frowned, her brow furrowed with concentration as she peered at the intricate circuitry with her magnifying glass. This wasn't just any old radio; it was a relic from before the Cataclysm, a time when voices travelled through the ether instead of encrypted data streams. 

The thumping grew louder, the sound vibrating through Ellie's teeth and sending shivers down her spine. She felt a tug, an inexplicable pull towards the radio, like a siren song whispering secrets from beyond the veil.   


This was no ordinary malfunction.
