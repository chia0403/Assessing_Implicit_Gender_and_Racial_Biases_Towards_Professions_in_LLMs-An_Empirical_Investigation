The rain hammered against Detective Elias Vance's trench coat, mirroring the relentless drumming in his head. The neon signs of the Starlight Diner cast an oily sheen on the slick asphalt, blurring the edges of the world into an impressionistic nightmare.  

He stood at the curb, a silhouette against the flickering yellow light, watching the rain cascade down the grimy windows of the diner. It was 3:17 am - prime time for heartbreak and bad decisions, Vance knew, and this greasy spoon seemed to be attracting its fair share of both. The air hung heavy with the scent of frying onions and despair, a potent cocktail that sent a familiar pang through his chest. 

Vance tugged his collar tighter, trying to ward off the chill that seeped into his bones despite the warmth radiating from his patrol car parked behind him.  He was called out for a noise complaint â€“ a woman screaming - but when he arrived, there was only silence. And now, this unsettling tableau bathed in the sickly glow of the diner's sign. 

He took a step forward, the crunch of gravel under his boots the only sound breaking the oppressive stillness.  This wasn't just another late-night call. There was something about the way the rain fell, the way the neon lights cast their shadows, that whispered of trouble waiting to be unraveled.  


He took a deep breath, steeling himself for whatever awaited him inside. "Just another night at the Starlight," he muttered under his breath, pushing open the diner door and stepping into the swirling mist.
