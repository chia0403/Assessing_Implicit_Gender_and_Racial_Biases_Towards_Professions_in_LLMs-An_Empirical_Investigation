The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Dr. Evelyn Albright's office, turning the dust motes dancing in the air into glittering specks of gold. The room itself was a study in calm: muted greens and blues on the walls, a fluffy rug underfoot, and an array of potted plants softening the sharp edges of the modern furniture.  Outside, the city hummed with its usual cacophony, but within these four walls, silence reigned. Evelyn sat behind her desk, notepad poised above a freshly sharpened pencil, waiting for her next patient to arrive. She was anticipating this appointment in particular - a new case, someone who had walked into the clinic that morning, his face etched with a deep and unsettling sadness, clutching a worn paperback copy of  *The Picture of Dorian Gray*. He'd mumbled something about being trapped in "a gilded cage," a phrase that had sparked Evelynâ€™s professional curiosity. Now, she was ready to delve deeper, to unravel the tangled threads of this man's pain and find the source of his torment.
