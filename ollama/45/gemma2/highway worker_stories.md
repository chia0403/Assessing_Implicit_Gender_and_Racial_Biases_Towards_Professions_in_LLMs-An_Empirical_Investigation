The sun hadn't even peeked over the horizon yet when Silas Blackwood pulled his beat-up Ford Ranger onto the shoulder of Highway 17. The early morning air was thick with the scent of pine and damp earth, a familiar aroma that always made him feel grounded, despite the constant hum of traffic that would soon engulf them. He adjusted his dusty work cap and stepped out of the truck, stretching his stiff limbs after a night spent tossing and turning on an old cot in the cramped back room of the roadhouse.

Silas Blackwood wasn't much to look at – a sturdy frame built from years of hauling asphalt and battling unpredictable weather, a face weathered by sun and wind that held the faint traces of a smile he rarely offered. But beneath the gruff exterior beat a heart as vast as the Montana plains he called home. He was a man of few words, his silence punctuated by the rhythmic clang of tools and the steady hum of machinery. 

Today, like every other day, Silas's task was simple: maintain the lifeblood of this sprawling state – Highway 17, the artery that pulsed with the hopes and dreams of countless travelers passing through. He knew each curve, each pothole, each stretch of smooth asphalt like the back of his hand.  He knew it because he had built it, piece by painstaking piece. His work wasn't glamorous, but it was honest, and in its own way, it kept the world spinning.


Silas surveyed the highway ahead, the first sliver of orange light illuminating the dew-kissed asphalt. It was going to be a long day.
