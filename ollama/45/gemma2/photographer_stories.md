The air hung thick with the scent of salt and seaweed, a briny fog clinging to Amelia "Amy" Roseweather's worn leather jacket as she adjusted her camera lens. Dawn was just breaking over the Cornish coast, painting the sky in soft hues of pink and orange that mirrored the fiery streaks across her latest film roll.  She loved capturing these moments – the quiet stillness before the day began, the seagulls already squawking their morning greetings, the fishing boats bobbing gently on the water like forgotten toys.

Amy wasn't a tourist photographer, snapping pictures of quaint villages and souvenir shops. She was drawn to the raw beauty of the coast, its rugged cliffs battered by relentless waves, its hidden coves whispering secrets to the wind. Her lens sought out the stories etched into the landscape – the weathered faces of fishermen, the lonely dance of seabirds against a stormy sky, the ephemeral beauty of light refracting through crashing waves.  This was her canvas, this wild, untamed expanse, and she was its devoted chronicler. 


Today, however, a different story beckoned. A crumpled newspaper clipping tucked into Amy's weathered camera bag hinted at a legend whispered amongst the locals – the ghost ship of St. Ives Bay. The article spoke of a spectral vessel, said to appear on stormy nights, its tattered sails filled with an ethereal glow. Amy had dismissed it as folklore, but something in the way her grandfather's eyes had lit up when recounting the tale sparked a flicker of curiosity within her. 


As the first rays of sunlight glinted off the water, turning the sea into a shimmering tapestry of gold and turquoise, Amy knew she had to find out more. This wasn't just another photograph; this was a chance to capture something truly extraordinary, something that defied logic and reason. The ghost ship of St. Ives Bay waited, its secrets hidden beneath the veil of myth and legend. And Amy Roseweather, armed with her camera and an insatiable thirst for truth, was determined to unveil them.
