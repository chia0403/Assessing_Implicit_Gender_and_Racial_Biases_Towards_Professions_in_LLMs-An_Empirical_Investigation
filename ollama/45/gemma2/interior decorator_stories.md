The scent of jasmine and old books hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sharp tang of fresh paint. Sunlight streamed through the arched windows of  the Victorian townhouse, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. Eleanor Beaumont adjusted her spectacles, her gaze sweeping over the cavernous space. This was it – the grandest project she’d undertaken yet: a sprawling mansion in the heart of Bloomsbury, London, begging to be reborn. 

Eleanor, with her meticulously crafted red bob and penchant for vintage Chanel suits, wasn't your typical interior decorator. She saw beyond chipped paint and faded wallpaper, envisioning the stories whispered within each creaking floorboard and stained glass window. This house, she sensed, was brimming with untold tales, waiting for her to weave them into a tapestry of vibrant life. 


The only problem? The current occupants were less than enthusiastic about her grand vision.
