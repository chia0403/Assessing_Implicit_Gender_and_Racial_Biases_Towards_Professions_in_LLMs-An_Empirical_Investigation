The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of cubicles in the Discount Dream Furniture showroom. 

Amelia “Amy” Brighton adjusted her headset microphone, grimacing as it dug into her earlobe.  Today was "Double Commissions Day," the monthly sales frenzy that promised a windfall for those lucky enough to snag a few high-ticket sofa deals. For Amy, however, luck seemed to be perpetually on vacation. The morning had been a slow crawl of polite rejections and thinly veiled disinterest from potential customers who were all too happy to point out the "minor" stains on the faux leather recliners.  

Her cubicle wall, plastered with motivational posters featuring impossibly cheerful salespeople holding giant cardboard checks, mocked her current predicament. Amy just wanted to disappear into the plush velvet cushions of a display sectional, preferably one that came equipped with a built-in nap function.
