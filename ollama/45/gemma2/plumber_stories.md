Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of "Pipes & Dreams Plumbing," a symphony of drumming that matched the chaotic rhythm in Alistair Montgomery's head.  Alistair hunched over a sputtering boiler, its gurgling like a disgruntled troll demanding sacrifice. The workshop, crammed with tools, spare parts, and the pungent aroma of solder and engine oil, was his sanctuary. 

His phone rang, shattering the tense silence. He snatched it up, his voice gruff from years of yelling into leaky pipes. "Montgomery's Pipes & Dreams, Alistair speaking." 


**Setting:** A cramped, cluttered plumbing workshop in a coastal town perpetually shrouded in mist and rain.
