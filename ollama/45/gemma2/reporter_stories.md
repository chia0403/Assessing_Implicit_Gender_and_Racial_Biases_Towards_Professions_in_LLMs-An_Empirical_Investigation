The rain hammered against the windowpanes of Evelyn Briarwood's tiny Brooklyn apartment, each drop echoing the frantic beat of her heart. Outside, the city was a symphony of howling wind and rushing water, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The phone cradled in her hand felt cold and lifeless against her clammy skin.  

She reread the message for the tenth time: "Meet me at the old clock tower at midnight. Come alone. Don't tell anyone." No signature, no sender ID, just that chillingly simple plea. 

Evelyn wasn't usually one to chase whispers in the dark. As a reporter for the Daily Sentinel, she dealt with facts, hard evidence, and verifiable truths. But this… this felt different. A gut instinct, a pull towards the unknown, was urging her forward. She knew the risks. The old clock tower was rumored to be haunted, a derelict monument to forgotten memories, shrouded in local legends of disappearances and dark dealings.  

But Evelyn Briarwood had always been driven by stories, especially those that refused to stay buried. And this one… this one felt like it could change everything.
