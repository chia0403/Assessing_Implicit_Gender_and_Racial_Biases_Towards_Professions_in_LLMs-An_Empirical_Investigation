The air in The Rusty Mug was thick with the scent of stale beer and unfulfilled dreams. Neon flickered through the haze hanging over the worn bartop, illuminating a collection of chipped mugs and sticky coasters that told tales as old as time. Behind the bar, Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, known to regulars simply as "Millie," wiped down a glass with practiced ease. Her movements were fluid, efficient, a symphony of clinking bottles and measured pours honed over countless nights serving the city's weary souls.

The Rusty Mug was her haven, a sanctuary from the storm that raged outside. It wasn't glamorous, but it was honest. The regulars, their faces etched with a lifetime of laughter and heartache, were more like family. They came for the cheap drinks, yes, but also for the warmth, the shared silence, the occasional burst of raucous conversation that filled the room with a sense of temporary belonging.  

Tonight, however, something felt different. The usual hum of chatter was subdued, replaced by an uneasy tension that prickled at Millie's skin. A storm was brewing outside, but it wasn't just the weather. There was a darkness in the air, a premonition that tonight, the Rusty Mug wouldn't just be serving drinks, it would be serving up something far more sinister.
