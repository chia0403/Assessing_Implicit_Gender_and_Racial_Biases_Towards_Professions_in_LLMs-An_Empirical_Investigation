The humid July air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" McAlister like a second skin as he wrestled with the tangled mess of wires in Mrs. Henderson's attic.  Sweat trickled down his temple, stinging his eyes, and the dusty air stung his nostrils. The lone bare bulb hanging precariously from the ceiling cast long, dancing shadows on the cluttered space, illuminating faded photographs and forgotten furniture draped in white sheets. 

Bart sighed, wiping his brow with a greasy rag.  Mrs. Henderson had called about a flickering light fixture, but as usual, it turned out to be a much larger problem â€“ a faulty ground wire dating back to the house's construction in the early 1900s. This was common in older homes; sometimes Bart felt like he spent more time rewiring the past than fixing the present.

Outside, the cicadas hummed their relentless summer song, and the distant rumble of a thunderstorm promised relief from the oppressive heat.  But for now, Bart was trapped in this attic, surrounded by dust, shadows, and the silent weight of history.
