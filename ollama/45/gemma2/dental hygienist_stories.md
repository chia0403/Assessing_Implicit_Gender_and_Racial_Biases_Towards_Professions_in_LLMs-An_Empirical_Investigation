The air in Dr. Miller’s office hung heavy with the scent of peppermint and disinfectant, punctuated by the rhythmic whir of the suction machine. Sunlight streamed through the blinds, casting stripes across the worn linoleum floor. Amelia “Amy” Rosewater, her bright blue scrubs a stark contrast to the sterile white surroundings, adjusted the dental mirror. 

Mr. Henderson was next in line, a man who always seemed perpetually on edge. Amy had cleaned his teeth for years – she knew the telltale signs: the clenched jaw, the quickened pulse, the way he flinched at even the slightest touch of the scaler. He was a nervous wreck under the best of circumstances, and today, something felt different.  His eyes were darting around the room, his hands trembled slightly as he held the bib around his neck.

Amy took a deep breath, steeling herself. “Ready, Mr. Henderson?” she asked, her voice calm and reassuring. But even as she spoke, she couldn’t shake the feeling that something was deeply wrong.
