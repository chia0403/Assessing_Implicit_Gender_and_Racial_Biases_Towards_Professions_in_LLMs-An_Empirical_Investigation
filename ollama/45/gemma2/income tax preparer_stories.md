The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Butterfield's head, casting a sterile glow over the mountain of paperwork spread across her desk. Outside, the first hint of spring sun poked through the grey February sky, but inside "Amelia's Accurate Accounting," it was perpetually autumn – cool, crisp, and full of the rustling whispers of tax forms. 

Amelia sighed, pushing her auburn hair behind her ear, a faint scent of cinnamon tea clinging to her worn cardigan.  Another year, another deluge of W-2s, 1099s, and exasperated sighs. This was her lifeblood – deciphering the financial mysteries of others, unearthing deductions, and conjuring up enough tax credits to make even Scrooge smile. 

But this year felt different. A gnawing anxiety hummed beneath Amelia's usual calm demeanor. A new client, a man shrouded in secrets and sporting an unsettlingly knowing grin, had walked through her door yesterday. He’d promised Amelia a challenge like no other, and Amelia, for the first time in years, found herself looking forward to it.
