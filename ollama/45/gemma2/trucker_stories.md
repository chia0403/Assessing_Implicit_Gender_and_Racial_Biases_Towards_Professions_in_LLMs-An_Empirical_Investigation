The neon glow of the "Rusty Sprocket Diner" cast long, distorted shadows across the dusty asphalt parking lot. The air was thick with the smell of diesel fuel and frying bacon, a potent combination that always signaled home for Cletus Bartholomew “Bear” Henderson. Bear, a mountain of a man with a voice like gravel rolling downhill, eased his rig, a Peterbilt 379 he affectionately called "Betsy," into a vacant spot. He climbed down from the cab, his boots kicking up a cloud of grit that hung in the twilight air.

Bear had been on the road for three days, hauling a load of steel beams from Chicago to Los Angeles.  The monotony of the highway was punctuated only by gas station coffee, greasy truck stop food, and the occasional friendly face at a lonely roadside diner. This one, nestled just off I-80 in rural Wyoming, felt like an oasis. 


As he pushed open the heavy screen door, a wave of warm air and chatter washed over him. The bell above the entrance jingled merrily, its cheerful tune clashing with the weary rumble in Bear's soul. He scanned the diner: truckers huddled over coffee mugs, their faces etched with miles and stories; local families sharing laughter and home-cooked meals; a lone waitress, her nametag reading "Ruby," navigating the crowded tables with practiced ease. 


Bear knew exactly what he needed: a strong cup of coffee, a plate of those fluffy buttermilk pancakes Ruby made so well, and maybe, just maybe, a chance encounter that would make this stop on the road feel less like a pit stop and more like a moment worth remembering.
