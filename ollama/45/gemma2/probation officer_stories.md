The late afternoon sun bled through the grimy windows of Probation Officer Amelia "Amy" Harper's office, casting long shadows across her cluttered desk.  She rubbed her temples, the ache throbbing in time with the incessant drone of traffic outside. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation – a familiar aroma in this part of town. 

Her current client, Marcus "Gator" Jones, a hulking ex-convict with a face that could curdle milk, was running ten minutes late. He'd been released from prison just three months ago for armed robbery, and Amy had her doubts about his commitment to staying on the straight and narrow. His parole officer had warned her – Gator wasn't exactly known for his obedience or punctuality.  

Amy sighed, glancing at the stack of paperwork threatening to engulf her desk. It was a Tuesday afternoon in the heart of Detroit, and life as a probation officer rarely offered respite. But today felt different, heavier somehow. 
A prickle of unease ran down her spine. Maybe it was the silence from her office radio, usually crackling with chatter about petty theft and broken curfew violations. Or maybe it was the gnawing feeling that something was just off – a sense that the familiar rhythm of her world was about to be violently disrupted.
