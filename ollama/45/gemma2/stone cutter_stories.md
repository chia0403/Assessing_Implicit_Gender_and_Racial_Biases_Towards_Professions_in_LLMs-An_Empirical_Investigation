The early morning sun cast long, skeletal shadows across the dusty yard as Elara Brienne wiped sweat from her brow.  Her calloused hands, roughened by years of shaping stone, held a chisel poised above a block of granite that pulsed with an inner fire, its veins laced with streaks of quartz like frozen lightning. The air hung thick with the scent of sawdust and grit, a familiar aroma that clung to everything in Elara's life. Her workshop, nestled in the heart of the bustling city of Alora on the edge of the sun-scorched desert, was more than just a place of work; it was her sanctuary. 

Alora, once a thriving hub of trade and magic, had fallen on hard times. The once vibrant marketplace now echoed with the empty chatter of merchants long gone, their stalls gathering dust under the relentless desert sun. But Elara's workshop remained, a stubborn bastion against the encroaching decay, its stone walls whispering tales of a brighter past.  

Today, however, the familiar comfort of her craft offered little solace. A commission had arrived, one that promised both wealth and danger â€“ a sculpture for the enigmatic Oracle, rumored to reside in the shadow of the ancient Citadel. Elara knew that accepting this task meant venturing into a world beyond the dusty streets she called home, a world where secrets whispered on the wind and shadows held more than just darkness.
