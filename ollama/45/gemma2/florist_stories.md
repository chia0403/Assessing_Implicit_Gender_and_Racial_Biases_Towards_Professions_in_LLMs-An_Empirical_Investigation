The scent of hyacinths hung heavy in the air, their intoxicating perfume mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly dug soil. Sunlight streamed through the skylights of "Bloom & Wither," bathing the shop in a warm glow that danced across rows of vibrant blooms.  

Elara Willowbrook hummed along to a soft jazz tune playing on the old radio, her hands deftly arranging lilies into a heart-shaped bouquet. Elara loved this time of day, just as the morning rush subsided and she was left with a quiet symphony of rustling leaves and buzzing bees. The bell above the door chimed, announcing a customer, pulling Elara from her peaceful reverie.  


She straightened up, wiping a stray pollen speck from her cheek, and smiled at the woman who entered. "Good morning," Elara greeted, "Welcome to Bloom & Wither. What can I help you find?"
