The humid air hung heavy over the cobblestone streets of Prague, thick with the scent of roasting almonds and the faint tang of Vltava River water.  Sunlight glinted off the gilded spires of St. Vitus Cathedral, casting long, dancing shadows across the throngs of tourists meandering through Old Town Square. 

Eliska Petrova, a tour guide with hair as dark as raven's wings and eyes that sparkled like the Bohemian crystals she occasionally hawked to her captive audiences, adjusted the strap of her crossbody bag and scanned the faces before her.  A motley crew of wide-eyed adventurers had gathered at her feet, ready to be swept away by her tales of Prague’s haunted past and its intricate web of legends. 

"Welcome, everyone!" Eliska's voice, crisp and melodic, cut through the din of the square. "I'm Eliska Petrova, and I'll be your guide on this journey through time."  Her smile was bright, but beneath it lay a glimmer of something else – an air of knowing, perhaps, or even a hint of trepidation. 


Eliska knew Prague like the back of her hand. Every nook, every cranny, whispered stories to those who listened closely. But today, there was a different energy in the air, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck that told her this wasn't just another ordinary tour.  Something felt…off.
