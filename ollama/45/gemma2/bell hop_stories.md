The humid New Orleans air hung thick and heavy over Bourbon Street, clinging to Theodore "Teddy" Dubois like a damp shroud. He wiped sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, leaving a smudge on his crisply pressed uniform. The Grand Magnolia Hotel, an ornate relic of pre-war elegance, pulsed with the vibrant rhythm of the city.  

From his perch behind the grand mahogany reception desk, Teddy surveyed the chaotic tableau before him. Tourists jostled each other, vying for space with street performers and vendors hawking their wares. Bourbon Street was a symphony of cacophony - the clanging of brass bands, the raucous laughter from open-air bars, and the persistent thrum of bass vibrating through the cobblestones. 

Teddy sighed, the familiar weariness settling in his shoulders. Another night, another deluge of eccentric guests, misplaced luggage, and outlandish requests. He was just a bell hop at the Grand Magnolia, but he knew every inch of its hallowed halls, every creaking floorboard, every whispered secret echoing through the corridors. Tonight, though, something felt different, a subtle shift in the air that sent a shiver down his spine.
