The pungent aroma of blood and iron hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Silas Finchfeather. He stood hunched over his stainless steel counter, cleaver glinting under the harsh fluorescent lights that cast long shadows across the cramped butcher shop. The "Finchfeather's Fine Meats" sign creaked gently in the afternoon breeze that pushed through the open door, stirring the wisps of sawdust that perpetually danced on the floor. 

Silas’ weathered hands expertly navigated the carcass of a recently slaughtered boar, his knife slicing through sinew and fat with practiced ease. The rhythmic thud of cleaver against bone echoed in the quiet shop, punctuated by the occasional grunt as Silas worked. He wasn't just butchering meat; he was sculpting it, transforming raw flesh into edible art. Each cut, each twist, spoke to a lifetime spent honing his craft, a legacy passed down from generations of Finchfeathers before him.

But today, the familiar scent of blood and bone couldn't mask the undercurrent of unease that prickled Silas’ skin. The silence of the afternoon was too heavy, the air thick with an unspoken tension. He could feel eyes watching him from beyond the dusty windowpanes, their gaze unseen but undeniably present. Something wasn't right.
