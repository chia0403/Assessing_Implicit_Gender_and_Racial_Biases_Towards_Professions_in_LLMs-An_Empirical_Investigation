The scent of crayons and glue hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of spilled juice boxes and the faint, cloying sweetness of a forgotten birthday cupcake left on the shelf. Sunlight streamed through the rainbow-colored streamers strung across the classroom windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in its golden beams.  

Amelia Rose Hawthorne surveyed her kingdom, a whirlwind of tiny humans buzzing like overexcited bees. Five-year-olds with mismatched socks and paint-splattered faces clambered over blocks, shrieked during a boisterous game of tag, and whispered secrets in hushed tones while drawing fantastical creatures on oversized sheets of paper. Amelia smiled, her heart swelling with the familiar warmth that came with watching them blossom. She loved this chaos, this vibrant tapestry of childhood dreams and messy realities woven together within these four walls. 


It was a Monday morning in Ms. Hawthorne's kindergarten class at Sunnybrook Elementary, and anything could happen.
