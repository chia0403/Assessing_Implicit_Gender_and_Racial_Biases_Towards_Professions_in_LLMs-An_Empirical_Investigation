The pungent smell of stale beer and desperation hung heavy in the air of The Dusty Curtain Theatre. Director Emilia “Em” Beatrice Cartwright surveyed her kingdom – a cramped stage littered with mismatched props, flickering fluorescent lights casting long shadows over faded velvet curtains.  

Em traced a finger across the cracked surface of an ancient director's chair, its once vibrant crimson now a dusty rose. This was her sanctuary, this ramshackle theatre on the fringes of London, where she poured her heart and soul into bringing stories to life, no matter how outlandish or forgotten.  

Tonight, however, a sense of unease gnawed at her. The usual buzz of rehearsals was absent, replaced by an unnerving quiet. The cast, usually a chaotic symphony of voices and emotions, were conspicuously missing. Em sighed, the weight of mounting anxieties settling heavy in her chest. Her phone rang, shattering the silence. It was Michael, the stage manager, his voice strained with worry.  

"Em," he whispered, "they're gone."
