The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Harper's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the linoleum floor that had seen better days.  She tapped her acrylic nails against the cracked surface of the register, counting down the minutes until her shift ended. The late afternoon rush at Big Bob's Bargain Bins was always a trial: a relentless stream of bargain hunters, haggling over chipped mugs and dented cans, leaving behind a trail of crumpled receipts and dust bunnies. 

Amy glanced at the clock - 4:52 pm. Just eight more minutes until freedom. She sighed, wishing she could escape this purgatory of discount goods and endless small talk.  The door jingled as another customer entered, shattering her fleeting daydream. This one looked different, though. He wasn't rummaging through the aisles; he was staring intently at something in Amy’s peripheral vision – a dusty glass case holding an assortment of vintage trinkets.
