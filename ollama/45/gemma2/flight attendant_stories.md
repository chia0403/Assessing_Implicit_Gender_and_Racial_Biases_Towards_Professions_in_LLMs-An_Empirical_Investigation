The hum of the Boeing 747 was like a lullaby to Amelia Grace Carter. She’d spent years listening to it, her heart syncing with the engine's rhythmic pulse.  Amelia, or Amy as most passengers called her, had a sixth sense for turbulence – she felt it in her bones before it even rattled the coffee cups. But on this flight from London to Tokyo, something felt different. The air was thick with an unspoken tension, like a storm brewing beneath the calm blue sky. 

It wasn't just the passengers. Amy noticed a subtle shift among the crew too. They moved with less energy, their smiles strained. Even Captain Tanaka, usually a beacon of reassuring authority, seemed unusually quiet as he navigated through the pre-departure checklist. The setting sun cast long shadows across the tarmac, painting the scene in hues of orange and purple. A lone hawk circled overhead, its cry piercing the stillness.  


Amy knew something was off. She couldn't pinpoint it, but a prickle of unease ran down her spine. As she fastened her seatbelt for takeoff, she glanced at the reflection in the window – her face pale against the vibrant sky. It wasn't just the sunset playing tricks on her; this flight was going to be anything but ordinary.
