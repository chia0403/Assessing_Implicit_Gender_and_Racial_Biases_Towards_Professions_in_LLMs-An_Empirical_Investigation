Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center, each drop a tiny hammer tapping out an anxious rhythm on the glass. Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne sat hunched over her desk, her brow furrowed in concentration as she meticulously studied the latest assessment report for her patient, Mr. Alistair Finch. 

Amelia, known affectionately to her patients as "Rose," was a skilled and compassionate occupational therapist, dedicated to helping people reclaim their independence after injury or illness.  Willow Creek, nestled amidst the rolling green hills of rural Oregon, was her haven – a place where nature's quiet power mirrored the resilience she witnessed in her patients every day. 

But this case felt different. Mr. Finch, a renowned botanist, had suffered a devastating stroke that left him with limited mobility and speech. His once vibrant spirit seemed dimmed, replaced by a quiet resignation that gnawed at Rose’s optimism. She knew time was of the essence – if she couldn't reignite his spark, she feared he would succumb to the shadows creeping in around him.


  
**Setting:** Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center, a cozy and brightly-lit facility nestled amidst rolling green hills in rural Oregon. The rain outside creates a sense of melancholy and urgency.
