The bell above the door to Hawthorne Apothecary jingled its familiar tune as Evelyn Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles and peered over her half-moon reading glasses. A chill wind swept in with a flurry of autumn leaves, swirling around Ameliaâ€™s ankles like miniature tornadoes. Amelia shivered, pulling her scarlet coat tighter around her, the vibrant color a stark contrast to the muted browns and grays of the November day. 

Hawthorne Apothecary was Evelyn's haven - a sanctuary of warmth and earthy scents tucked away on a cobblestone street in the historic district of Willow Creek. Sunlight streamed through the stained-glass window depicting an apothecary scene, casting dancing rainbows onto the shelves stocked with jars filled with colorful powders, dried herbs, and curious bottles of liquid concoctions.  The air hummed with the quiet murmur of customers browsing for remedies, their voices blending with the soothing scent of lavender oil and cinnamon. Evelyn, her silver hair pulled back in a neat bun, surveyed the scene with a practiced eye, ready to offer her wisdom and care to anyone who walked through her door.
