The air was thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume that usually calmed Alistair Blackwood. Not today. Today, the forest seemed to hold its breath, waiting. The usual symphony of birdsong was muted, replaced by an unsettling stillness. Alistair wiped the sweat from his brow, leaving a streak through the grime coating his face. He hefted the chainsaw in his calloused hands, the familiar weight both comforting and ominous. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the clearing where he stood, illuminating swirling dust motes dancing in the air. The towering pines around him seemed to lean inwards, their branches interlacing like gnarled fingers against the dying light.  Beyond the treeline, a jagged silhouette of mountains rose against the crimson sky, a silent backdrop to the unease gnawing at Alistair's gut. He had been logging these woods for twenty years, knew every twist and turn of the trails, every creak of the ancient trees. But today, something felt different.  


Something wasn't right.
