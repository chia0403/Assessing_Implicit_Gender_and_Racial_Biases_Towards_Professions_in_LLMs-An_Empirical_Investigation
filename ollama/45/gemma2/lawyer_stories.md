The humid August air hung heavy in Amelia "Amy" Brighton's office, thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the turmoil churning within her. A stack of files teetered precariously on the edge of her desk, each one a ticking time bomb threatening to explode if she didn't find a solution soon.

Amy wasn't just any lawyer; she was known in the bustling city of New Orleans as "The Nightingale," a moniker earned for her ability to weave intricate legal arguments that could sway even the most hardened judge. But lately, the music had died. The cases felt more like a chorus of despair than a symphony of justice. 

Her current client, a single mother named Marie Dupree, was facing eviction from her modest apartment in the historic French Quarter.  Marie's landlord, a ruthless property developer known as Mr. "Big Easy" Dubois, had been systematically driving out long-term residents to make way for luxury condos and trendy boutiques. Amy knew this fight wouldn't be easy. Big Easy Dubois was notorious for his legal maneuvering and unwavering greed. But Amy Brighton wasn't one to back down from a challenge, even if it meant facing the storm alone.
