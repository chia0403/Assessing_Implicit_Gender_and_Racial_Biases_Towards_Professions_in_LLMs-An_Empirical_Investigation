The humid Miami air clung to Elias Beaumont like a second skin as he surveyed the lobby of the Edenia Hotel. Palm trees swayed languidly outside the expansive glass doors, their fronds whispering secrets in the gentle sea breeze. Inside, the polished marble floors gleamed under the warm glow of crystal chandeliers, reflecting the vibrant energy buzzing through the opulent space.  

Elias, with his perfectly knotted tie and bespoke suit, was a pillar of composure amidst the swirling chaos of arriving guests. He greeted each one with a practiced smile and an effortless grace that had become his trademark as head concierge at the Edenia. He knew every guest by name, their preferred drinks, and even their travel anxieties. But today, Elias felt a prickle of unease beneath his polished exterior. A woman in a crimson dress stood apart from the throng, her gaze fixed on something beyond the velvet ropes that separated the lobby from the exclusive Eden Suite. Her silence was heavy, almost palpable. This wasn't just another check-in. This was different.
