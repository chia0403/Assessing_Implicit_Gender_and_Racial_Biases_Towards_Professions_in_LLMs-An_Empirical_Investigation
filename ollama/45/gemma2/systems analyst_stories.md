Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's office, blurring the cityscape outside into an impressionistic watercolour of neon and shadow. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the glass panes and sending shivers down her spine despite the artificial warmth emanating from the underfloor heating. It was the kind of storm that brewed discontent, and Amelia, usually content in the ordered chaos of her work as a systems analyst for a multinational corporation, felt it gnawing at the edges of her peace. 

Her monitor glowed a pale blue in the dim office, displaying lines of code scrolling like an endless river. She was knee-deep in debugging the new payroll system, a labyrinthine beast she'd affectionately dubbed "The Leviathan." It hummed with a malevolent energy, spitting out error messages that felt personally directed at her competence.  

Amelia sighed, pushing back a strand of dark hair that had escaped its braid. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempest brewing within The Leviathan's digital core.
