The air hung thick with the scent of hay and manure, a familiar perfume to Amelia Briarwood that never failed to ground her. Sunlight slanted through the gaps in the corrugated tin roof of the barn, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. She knelt beside Daisy, a calico cow with one ear perpetually flopped over, gently massaging the knotted muscles in her neck. Daisy mooed contentedly, her large brown eyes fixed on Amelia with a trust that warmed the young woman's chest.  

Amelia Briarwood, known affectionately as Millie to the animals and the handful of regulars who frequented their little farm, was more than just a caretaker. She was a confidante, a healer, a friend to every creature under her charge. From the skittish chickens pecking at fallen grains to Bartholomew, the grumpy old goat with a penchant for headbutts, Millie knew each animal's quirks and habits like the back of her hand. This farm, nestled on a windswept hill overlooking the sleepy village of Willow Creek, was her sanctuary, a place where life moved at a gentler pace, dictated by the rhythms of nature and the needs of her furry, feathered, and scaled companions.
