The siren's wail cut through Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's dreams like a shard of glass, jolting her upright in bed. She didn't even need to check the clock; the rhythmic pulse of the emergency lights filtering through her bedroom curtains told her it was 3:17 AM, another Tuesday night just like any other in Firehouse Station 5.  

Amy stumbled out of bed, pulling on her uniform with practiced ease. Her reflection in the dusty mirror showed a woman hardened by years of battling blazes and the ever-present weight of responsibility. She wasn't pretty in the conventional sense; her face was weathered, etched with laugh lines around eyes that held a flicker of perpetual alertness, and her auburn hair was usually tied back in a tight bun, escaping in stubborn strands. But there was a raw beauty about her, a fierceness that came from facing danger head-on, time and again.

Outside, the air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and impending rain. Station 5, perched on a hill overlooking the sprawling metropolis of New Haven, looked like a solitary sentinel against the dark, its red brick facade glowing faintly in the emergency lights. Inside, the familiar hum of activity greeted Amy: the clinking of metal, muffled conversations, and the occasional barking order from Lieutenant Jackson, her grizzled mentor. The city was never asleep; tonight, it needed them.
