The sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Thorne's neck, turning his already sweat-slicked brow into a gleaming river. His calloused fingers tightened around the hammer, knuckles white as bone. Dust motes danced in the golden afternoon light that slanted through the gaps in the steel skeleton of the new skyscraper. The city sprawled beneath them, a sprawling canvas of concrete and glass shimmering with heat haze. Eli squinted, his gaze tracing the dizzying heights they'd already scaled, another story added to the ever-growing monument to ambition.

Eli grunted in response, heaving another heavy steel beam into place. He loved the physicality of this work, the raw power it demanded. But today, even the familiar rhythm of construction couldn't fully drown out the unease gnawing at him.  He had a feeling this building, towering over the city like a jagged tooth, held secrets - secrets that might soon be uncovered, secrets that could pull him down with them.
