The air in Alistair "Ace" Worthington's office smelled faintly of burnt coffee and desperation. The sleek mahogany desk, usually gleaming under the harsh glare of the Manhattan sun, was now cluttered with half-empty energy drink cans and crumpled reports, casualties of a market downturn that had gripped Wall Street like a fever dream. Ace himself looked every bit the part of a man battling an invisible enemy: sweat beaded on his brow, dark circles clung stubbornly to his eyes, and his tie was askew, mirroring the chaotic state of the markets he so desperately tried to tame. 

The city outside his floor-to-ceiling windows thrummed with a frenetic energy, oblivious to the financial turmoil unfolding within the glass and steel canyons of downtown Manhattan. Yellow cabs screamed through intersections, their horns blaring in a symphony of urban anxiety, while pedestrians hurried by, faces etched with a mix of ambition and unease. Ace watched them all, a detached observer caught in the whirlwind of his own world.


He knew he was living on borrowed time. His clients, jittery and demanding, were watching every dip and dive of the market with hawk-like intensity. One wrong move, one miscalculated bet, and it would all come crashing down around him.
