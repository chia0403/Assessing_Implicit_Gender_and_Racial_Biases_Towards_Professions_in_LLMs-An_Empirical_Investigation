The midday sun slanted through the dusty windows of Dr. Amelia Brighton's office, casting long shadows across the faded floral wallpaper. The air was thick with the sterile scent of antiseptic and the faint hum of the dental drill that sat silent on its stand. A worn copy of "Dental Digest" lay open on a nearby table, the glossy pages showcasing impossibly straight teeth and beaming smiles. Amelia sighed, pushing back her spectacles to peer at the appointment schedule taped to the wall.  

It was slow today. Not uncommon for a Tuesday in Harmony Creek, population 437 and shrinking. The town's once vibrant core had dwindled into a sleepy collection of boarded-up storefronts and aging residents clinging to memories of better days. Amelia wondered if her practice would be next.  


She glanced at the clock â€“ almost 1 pm. Time for lunch. She grabbed her worn leather purse, its zipper sticking stubbornly, and headed out into the quiet afternoon heat. Outside, the dusty main street stretched before her, lined with houses that seemed to sigh in the wind.
