The biting wind whipped across the obsidian plains, carrying with it the scent of sulfur and the mournful howl of distant beasts.  Elias Thornewell, his breath frosting in the air, tightened his grip on the hilt of his axe. He scanned the desolate landscape, the twilight sky bleeding into a bruised purple. The rusted spires of Citadel Aethelgard rose like skeletal sentinels against the encroaching darkness, a grim reminder that even in this forsaken wasteland, civilization clung to existence. 

Elias was one of the last remaining guards of the Citadel, his loyalty unwavering despite dwindling numbers and ever-present threats from the creatures that stalked the plains. The once bustling city had become a shadow of its former self, consumed by an eternal twilight cast by the monstrous Shadowmaw that roamed beyond the city walls. He stood at the western gate, the only barrier between Aethelgard and the encroaching darkness, his duty a constant vigil against an inevitable onslaught.
