Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond. The flickering neon sign of the Chinese takeout across the street cast an anemic glow onto her cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of case files teetering precariously beside a half-eaten bowl of instant noodles. A faint smell of mildew hung in the air, battling for supremacy with the pungent aroma of stale coffee. 

Eleanor sighed, rubbing weary eyes that felt gritty and dry. Another late night, another mountain of paperwork.  She was starting to feel like she lived more inside this cramped office than her own apartment. Yet, she couldn't bring herself to leave just yet. Not when tomorrow's hearing loomed large â€“ a case that could make or break her fledgling career.

This wasn't some white-collar embezzlement case or a divorce with assets worth millions.  No, Eleanor Vance specialized in the forgotten, the overlooked, the downtrodden. Her client this time was Mrs. Amelia Diaz, an elderly woman facing eviction from the only home she'd known for sixty years. A faceless corporation was bulldozing its way through her neighbourhood, leaving behind a trail of broken promises and shattered lives.  


Eleanor stared at the photo of Mrs. Diaz smiling brightly, framed on her desk. She wouldn't let her down. Not tonight. Not ever.
