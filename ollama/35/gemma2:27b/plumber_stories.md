Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' van, drumming out a chaotic rhythm that mirrored the state of his stomach. He hunched over the steering wheel, knuckles bone-white as he wrestled with the ancient Ford Transit, its engine coughing and spluttering like a chain smoker with emphysema.  

The address on the crumpled work order – 13 Raven's Crest Lane – seemed miles away down this sodden country lane. Twisted oak branches clawed at the van's rusted sides, dripping icy water onto Bart's already drenched overalls. He hadn't wanted this job, a late-night call out to some remote manor house for a "suspected leak." But desperation had forced his hand.

Bart needed the money.  The last few months had been lean.  His wife, Eleanor, was expecting their second child, and the bills were piling up faster than he could fix leaky faucets. So here he was, driving into the heart of a storm, towards a looming silhouette barely visible through the driving rain – Raven's Crest Manor.
