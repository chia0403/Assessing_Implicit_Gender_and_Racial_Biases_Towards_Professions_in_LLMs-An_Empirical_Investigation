The air hung thick with the smell of tar and dust, a familiar cocktail to Eli who'd spent the last decade patching up this unforgiving stretch of Route 66.

It started with a string of strange tire blowouts â€“ cars screeching to sudden halts, drivers stumbling out in confusion and fear. Then came the whispers, spreading like tumbleweeds through the crew: sightings of a pale figure standing at the edge of the road just before dusk, its eyes glowing an unnatural yellow.


Eli scoffed at the rumors, attributing them to sunstroke and overactive imaginations. Yet, as he surveyed the endless ribbon of highway disappearing into the hazy horizon, a shiver ran down his spine. Something felt off, deeply unsettling. The silence that followed the last truck's rumble was broken only by the incessant buzz of cicadas, their song now sounding unnervingly ominous.
