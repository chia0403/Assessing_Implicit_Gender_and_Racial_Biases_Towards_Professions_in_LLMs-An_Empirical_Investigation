Rain hammered against the dusty windowpane of Dr. Amelia Blackwood's chiropractic clinic, blurring the neon sign that flickered "Open" in a futile attempt to attract patients on this dismal Tuesday afternoon. Amelia sighed, leaning back in her ergonomically designed chair and running a hand through her fiery red curls. Business had been sluggish lately, a fact she blamed partly on the persistent drizzle that seemed determined to drown the small town of Oakhaven.

Oakhaven was a place where time moved slower, a sleepy hamlet nestled amongst rolling green hills and ancient oak trees (hence the name). It was the kind of town where everyone knew your name and gossip travelled faster than the wind whistling through the oaks. Amelia, who had arrived two years ago seeking a quieter life after the hustle and bustle of Chicago, was starting to feel the weight of that small-town scrutiny. 

The bell above the door jingled, startling her. A figure emerged from the gloom, shaking raindrops from a worn leather jacket. It was a young man, his face obscured by the shadow of a battered fedora. He looked out of place in Amelia's brightly lit clinic, his eyes wary and guarded.
