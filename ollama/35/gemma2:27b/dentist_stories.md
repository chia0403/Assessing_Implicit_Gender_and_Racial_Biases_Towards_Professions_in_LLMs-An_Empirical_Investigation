Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental practice, blurring the already dreary cityscape outside. A lone streetlamp cast an anemic yellow glow onto the cobblestones below, reflecting off the puddles with the faint shimmer of oil slicks. Inside, the air hung heavy with the sterile scent of disinfectant and anticipation.

Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight braid, stared at the reflection of her own weary face in the stainless steel instrument tray. Tonight was supposed to be different. Tonight, she wasn't just fixing chipped teeth and battling gingivitis. Tonight, she was meeting a patient who had promised to change everything â€“ a mysterious benefactor who claimed to hold the key to Eleanor's long-forgotten dreams.
