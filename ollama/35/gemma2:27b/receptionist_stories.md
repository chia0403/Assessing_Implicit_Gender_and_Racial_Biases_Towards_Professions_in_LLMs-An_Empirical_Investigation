The air conditioning wheezed its tired breath, battling the relentless July heat seeping through the glass facade of "Innovative Solutions Incorporated."  Anya Petrova tapped her manicured nails impatiently on the polished mahogany desk, the rhythmic click echoing through the cavernous lobby.  She watched the second hand tick by on the antique clock above the fireplace – a relic from the company's supposed "golden age" – and sighed.

It was 4:57 pm, three agonizing minutes before closing time. Outside, the city pulsed with the frenetic energy of rush hour, horns blaring and tires squealing against hot asphalt.  Inside, everything was eerily silent except for the rhythmic whir of Anya's computer fan and the occasional cough from Mr. Henderson, the head of accounting, who had taken up residence in his office corner since lunchtime. 

Anya longed to escape the stifling air and join the throngs on the street below, but she knew better than to leave before precisely 5:00 pm. Ms. Davenport, the CEO, was notoriously strict about punctuality, even for receptionists like Anya who were practically invisible in the grand scheme of things.
