Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Tap, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of light from the neon "Open" sign flickering precariously above the door. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale beer, sweat, and regret.  

Elias Thorne, his salt-and-pepper hair slicked back and a weary smile etched on his face, polished a chipped pint glass with methodical precision. His movements were practiced, almost robotic, honed by years spent behind the bar listening to the woes of the city's downtrodden. 

He wasn't sure what had drawn him to this life, tending bar in this dimly lit den of desperation. Maybe it was the comforting rhythm of clinking glasses and hushed conversations, or perhaps it was the fleeting glimpses into the lives of others, their stories spilling out like spilled liquor onto the worn wooden surface before him. Whatever the reason, The Rusty Tap had become his sanctuary, a place where he felt strangely at peace amidst the chaos.


Tonight, however, even Elias felt the oppressive weight of the storm raging outside. The usual motley crew of regulars were absent, leaving him alone with his thoughts and the incessant drumming of rain on the glass.
