The air in Elara Blackwood's atelier hung thick with the scent of lavender and singed silk. Sunlight streamed through the grimy attic window, illuminating motes of dust dancing above spools of thread and bolts of vibrant fabric. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Prague thrummed with life, but here, in this haven of creation, time seemed to stand still. Elara, her fingers stained indigo from a spilled dye bath, hunched over a half-finished gown, its bodice shimmering with silver embroidery like a constellation fallen to earth. The dress was destined for the Countess Von Habsburg's upcoming masquerade ball, and Elara felt the weight of expectation pressing down on her. Every stitch had to be perfect, every detail meticulously crafted, for whispers traveled fast in the elegant salons of Prague, and she couldn't afford a single misstep.
