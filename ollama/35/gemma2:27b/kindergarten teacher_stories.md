The aroma of crayons and hand sanitizer hung thick in the air, a peculiar but comforting blend that Amelia Cartwright had come to associate with home. Sunbeams slanted through the dusty windows of her kindergarten classroom, illuminating swirls of glitter glue on the tables and lopsided crayon drawings pinned haphazardly to the walls. Outside, the shrill screech of playground laughter punctuated the quiet murmur of story time.

Amelia perched on a tiny stool at the edge of the reading rug, her bright red cardigan a splash of color against the pastel rainbow backdrop.  She traced the worn edges of "Corduroy" with a fingertip, anticipating the inevitable chorus of "He needs a button!" when they reached the crucial page. Today felt different though. A restless energy hummed beneath the surface of her usual kindergarten chaos.


What will Amelia discover today that makes this day so different?
