The wind clawed at Elias "Hawk" Hawkins' weathered face as he wrestled the eighteen-wheeler along the lonely stretch of Interstate 80. Snow swirled in angry gusts, obscuring the world beyond his headlights into an ethereal white void. His CB radio crackled with static and the occasional unintelligible transmission, a testament to the storm's ferocity. Hawk gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles bone-white against the worn leather. He was hauling a load of timber from Oregon to Denver, a journey that had already taken longer than expected thanks to the unexpected blizzard.

The world outside was a canvas of blinding white and gray. The towering pines that normally lined the highway were now skeletal silhouettes, their branches bowed low under the weight of snow. Hawk squinted through the swirling flakes, his gaze searching for any sign of civilization â€“ a rest stop, a diner, anything to offer a moment's respite from the unrelenting storm.

He knew he should pull over, wait it out. But time was money, and Hawk needed this delivery. He had a daughter in college who relied on his paycheck, a roof over her head that depended on him keeping moving. So he pressed on, gritting his teeth against the howling wind and the gnawing worry that crept into his gut.
