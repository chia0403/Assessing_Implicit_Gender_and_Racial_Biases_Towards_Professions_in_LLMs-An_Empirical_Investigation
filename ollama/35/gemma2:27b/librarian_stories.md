Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Hawthorne Public Library, a relentless torrent mirroring Eleanor Beatrice Sinclair's mood. The towering oak shelves, usually a source of comfort, felt oppressive tonight, their dusty scent heavy in the air. Outside, wind howled through the ancient elm trees lining the cobblestone street, rattling the windowpanes like skeletal fingers.

A sense of unease had settled upon her, a prickling awareness that something wasn't right. It began with the peculiar book returned earlier â€“ its pages blank except for an intricate symbol etched into the leather cover. Now, the silence felt too profound, punctuated only by the ceaseless drumming of the rain and the unsettling creak of the building settling.
