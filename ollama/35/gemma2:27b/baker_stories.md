The aroma of caramelized sugar and cinnamon hung heavy in the air, mingling with the yeasty scent of rising dough. It was a symphony only Emilia Rose Beaumont, head baker at "The Sugarplum Fairy," could truly appreciate. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh were slick with morning rain, the grey sky mirroring the brooding mood that had settled over Emilia. 

She kneaded the brioche dough with frustrated vigor, her knuckles white against the warm, yielding mass. This wasn't how she'd pictured her life at thirty. She should be knee-deep in wedding cake orders, not staring out the window, wondering if she'd ever find a love as sweet as the pastries she crafted.
