Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Alistair Finnegan's cramped office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. Spreadsheets overflowed with red ink, each number a testament to his dwindling hope. He was drowning in debt, the once-solid ground of his accounting firm crumbling beneath the weight of bad investments and unforeseen circumstances. The clock ticked relentlessly, a mocking reminder that his creditors wouldn't accept excuses, only payments.

His office, tucked away above a bustling fish market in the heart of Dublin, reeked of salt and desperation. Stacks of dusty ledgers threatened to topple over, while forgotten coffee mugs sported rings of dried, brown despair. The flickering fluorescent light cast long shadows that danced ominously across the walls, further amplifying Alistair's sense of impending doom. He ran a weary hand through his thinning hair, wondering if he'd ever see the sun shine again.
