Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Benny "Sparks" Sullivan's truck, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. He gripped the steering wheel, knuckles white, as he stared at the dilapidated Victorian house looming before him. Its peeling paint and overgrown ivy whispered tales of neglect, a stark contrast to the sleek, modern homes he usually wired in affluent suburbs. This wasn't Benny's usual clientele.

He’d been hired by a Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood, a name that conjured images of lace handkerchiefs and afternoon tea, not flickering lights and faulty wiring. Her frantic phone call about “unnatural occurrences” tied to the house's electrical system had piqued his curiosity, if not his sanity. Benny wasn't one for ghosts or goblins, but something about Mrs. Blackwood’s trembling voice and hushed pleas had convinced him to take the job.

Now, as he wrestled with the decision of whether to turn tail and flee back to the comfort of predictable circuits, a sudden flash of lightning illuminated the house, momentarily casting grotesque shadows that danced on the lawn. A low rumble echoed in the distance, followed by an eerie silence that seemed to amplify the pounding of Benny’s heart. He took a deep breath, reminding himself that he was simply an electrician, there to fix faulty wiring, not exorcise demons.
