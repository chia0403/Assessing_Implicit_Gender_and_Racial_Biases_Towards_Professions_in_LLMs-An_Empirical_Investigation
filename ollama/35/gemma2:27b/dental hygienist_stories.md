The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the stainless steel instruments laid out on Eloise Penelope Ainsworth's tray. A faint scent of peppermint lingered in the air, battling with the ever-present antiseptic smell that permeated Dr. Miller's office. Eloise adjusted her mask and peered into the mirror reflecting back at her from the dental chair. Her usually bright green eyes looked tired, mirroring the exhaustion gnawing at her soul. It was Tuesday, 3:17 pm – the precise moment when she always started to question her life choices.

Eloise wasn't unhappy exactly, but a sense of monotony had settled over her like plaque on a neglected molar. For five years she'd diligently scraped, polished, and flossed away at other people's problems, but what about hers? The desire for something more, a spark to ignite her passion, burned beneath the surface. Today, it felt particularly intense.

As she waited for her next patient, Eloise idly tapped on the x-ray image displayed on the computer screen. It was an unremarkable set of molars – perfectly aligned and cavity-free. Just like everything else in her predictable life.
