The scent of lemon polish hung heavy in the air, a sharp contrast to the cloying sweetness of lilies that choked the grand foyer. Esmeralda "Esme" Hawthorne sighed, her reflection wavering in the polished mahogany surface of the antique table. She tugged at the starched collar of her uniform, the fabric itching against her neck like a swarm of tiny ants. 

This house, sprawling and imposing with its turrets and ivy-covered walls, was known as Blackwood Manor. It had once been filled with laughter, music, and the intoxicating aroma of Mrs. Blackwood's famous chocolate chip cookies. Now, it echoed with an unsettling stillness, punctuated only by the tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the hall and the mournful cry of wind whistling through the eaves.

Esme straightened her spine, determined to banish the melancholic air that clung to the manor like cobwebs. She wasn't one to succumb to sentimentality. For Esme Hawthorne, Blackwood Manor was simply another job, albeit a more demanding one than usual. The late Mrs. Blackwood had been a meticulous woman, and her daughter, Miss Amelia Blackwood, seemed intent on upholding her mother's legacy of pristine order. 

Today, however, Esme sensed something amiss. A tension hung in the air, heavier than the scent of lemon polish. As she pushed open the heavy oak door leading to Miss Blackwood's study, a shiver ran down her spine. Something wasn't right.
