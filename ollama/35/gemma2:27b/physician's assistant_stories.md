The rusted swingset creaked mournfully in the wind, its peeling paint mirroring the state of Hopewell Clinic. Amelia Rose Cartwright, PA-C, sighed, tugging her threadbare cardigan tighter against the chill October air seeping through the clinic’s warped windows. The waiting room was sparse – a lone magazine lay discarded on a table scarred with years of patient anxieties and coffee spills.

Hopewell, nestled in the heart of Appalachia, was a town teetering on the edge of forgotten. Its coal mines had long since gone silent, leaving behind a desolate landscape punctuated by crumbling homes and weary faces. Amelia, with her kind eyes and unwavering empathy, was a beacon of hope in this fading community.  But even her spirit was beginning to fray. The clinic’s dwindling funds, coupled with the relentless tide of chronic illnesses and addiction that plagued Hopewell, felt like an insurmountable challenge.

Today, however, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thicker than the autumn fog rolling in from the mountains.  As Amelia stepped into her cramped office, a manila envelope lay on her desk, addressed in bold, unfamiliar handwriting. Her curiosity piqued, she reached for it, a flicker of unease dancing in her gut.
