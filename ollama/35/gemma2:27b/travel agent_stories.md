The aroma of cardamom and clove wafted from Amelia Blackwood’s desk, mingling with the scent of old maps and dusty guidebooks.  Her office, tucked away on a quiet side street in Edinburgh's charming Stockbridge neighbourhood, was a haven for wanderlust. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating rows of vintage travel posters – snow-capped Himalayan peaks, turquoise Caribbean waters, and the terracotta rooftops of ancient Rome. Amelia herself embodied the spirit of adventure, her auburn hair always slightly windswept, freckled nose dusted with sun, and eyes that sparkled with a thousand untold stories. 

Today, however, a knot of anxiety tightened in Amelia's stomach. The phone lay silent on her desk, an unsettling absence for a Tuesday afternoon. Business had been slow lately, the usual flurry of honeymooners and intrepid explorers replaced by a disheartening lull.  Amelia tapped a finger nervously against a postcard depicting Machu Picchu, its ancient ruins bathed in golden sunlight. Could she keep "Wanderlust Travels" afloat?

Just then, the bell above the door jingled merrily, breaking the silence. A young woman with hesitant eyes and a battered backpack hesitantly stepped inside, her gaze darting around the room like a startled bird. This, Amelia thought, was just what she needed – a spark of adventure to ignite her own spirit once more.
