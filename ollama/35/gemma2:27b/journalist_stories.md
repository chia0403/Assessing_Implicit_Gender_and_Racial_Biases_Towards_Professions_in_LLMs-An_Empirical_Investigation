The humid Kolkata air clung to Eliza Chatterjee like a damp sari as she pushed through the teeming crowd in New Market. The cacophony of hawkers' cries, rickshaw bells, and Bollywood music blaring from a nearby stall assaulted her senses, but Eliza barely noticed. Her gaze was fixed on the crumpled newspaper clipping clutched in her hand - a grainy photo of a young woman with haunted eyes and a headline screaming "Missing Girl Found Dead in Ganges." This wasn't just another statistic; this was Maya Ghosh, a childhood friend Eliza had lost touch with years ago. Now, Maya’s face stared back at her from the newsprint, prompting Eliza to embark on a quest for truth that would lead her deep into the city's underbelly. 


Eliza, a tenacious journalist known for her unflinching pursuit of justice and her sharp wit, wasn't content with the police labeling Maya's death a simple suicide. Something felt off - Maya had been vibrant, full of life, a budding artist with dreams bigger than the cramped alleyways they both grew up in. Eliza's gut screamed foul play, and she vowed to uncover the truth behind Maya’s untimely demise, even if it meant facing powerful enemies who lurked in Kolkata’s shadowy corners.
