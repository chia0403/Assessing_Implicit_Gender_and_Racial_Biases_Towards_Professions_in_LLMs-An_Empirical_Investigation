The air hung thick with the smell of crayons and desperation. Emilia Finch, her brown curls escaping their haphazard bun, surveyed the chaos of her afternoon classroom. Seven-year-old Leo was attempting to build a tower out of blocks taller than himself, his tongue poking out in concentration. Three-year-old Maya wailed inconsolably beside him, convinced her teddy bear had been kidnapped by a rogue crayon.  And somewhere amidst the cacophony, little Liam had managed to get glitter glue all over his face and the carpet.

Emilia sighed, pulling a wet wipe from the dispenser clipped to her apron. This was the norm at Sunshine Daycare. A whirlwind of tiny humans, each with their own unique brand of adorable mayhem.  But today, Emilia felt a different kind of tension in the air. The usual joyful buzz had been replaced by an unsettling stillness.

Just then, the door swung open, revealing a woman Emilia didn't recognize. Her face was pale, her eyes red-rimmed. She clutched a small, worn teddy bear – eerily similar to Maya's missing one – in her trembling hand.
