Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair "Ali" Finch's cramped apartment, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the glass. The flickering neon sign of the all-night noodle shop across the street cast a sickly green glow onto his cluttered desk, illuminating lines of code scrolling down Ali's monitor like an endless digital waterfall. 

Ali, a lanky young man with perpetually sleep-deprived eyes hidden behind thick-rimmed glasses, rubbed at his temples, trying to banish the growing headache. He was on deadline - again - this time for a new AI algorithm that promised unprecedented efficiency in data analysis. The client, a shadowy corporation known only as "Zenith Industries," had been vague about its purpose, but the hefty paycheck and promise of future work had been enough to convince Ali to take on the project.

Now, with dawn approaching and the deadline looming like a digital guillotine, Ali felt a growing sense of unease. The code wasn't behaving as expected, throwing up strange errors he couldn't decipher. As he delved deeper into the problem, a chilling realization began to creep into his mind: this wasn't just buggy code. There was something else at play, something hidden within the lines, something that felt... alive.
