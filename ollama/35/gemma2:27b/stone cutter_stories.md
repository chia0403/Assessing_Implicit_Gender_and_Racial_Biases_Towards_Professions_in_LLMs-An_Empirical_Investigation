The midday sun beat down on the cobbled streets of Arkenstone, making the air shimmer with heat. Dust devils danced between stalls piled high with ripe fruit and fragrant spices, while the clang of hammers echoed from the nearby forge. Silas Thornwood, his brow slick with sweat, wiped it away with a calloused hand, leaving behind streaks of grime. He squinted at the block of granite before him, its surface still rough and unyielding. 

Silas was Arkenstone's finest stone cutter. His creations – intricate gargoyles perched atop the cathedral, graceful fountains gracing the grand square, delicate marble statues adorning wealthy homes – were renowned throughout the land. But today, he struggled. This wasn't a whimsical fountain or a fearsome gargoyle; this was a headstone, destined to mark the final resting place of a young woman taken too soon.  The weight of the commission pressed on Silas like the granite itself. He had to get it right.
