Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's clinic, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the worn linoleum floor. Ellie sighed, running a hand through her already dishevelled auburn hair. Outside, the sleepy coastal town of Seahaven was cloaked in an ominous grey fog, the relentless waves crashing against the cliffs like angry fists.

Ellie hadn't slept properly in days. The recent influx of sick and injured animals, many brought in from the storm-battered fishing boats, had her on edge. Today, she faced a particularly heartbreaking case: a young harbour seal pup, its once playful eyes now clouded with pain. It lay whimpering on the examination table, its tiny flipper mangled and swollen. Ellie's heart ached for the creature, a stark reminder of the fragility of life in the face of nature's fury.

The clinic door creaked open, breaking Ellie from her thoughts. A figure emerged from the swirling mist, their silhouette obscured by the rain-soaked hood of their coat. The newcomer paused, shaking droplets from their garment, before stepping inside and into the waiting room. Ellie straightened, bracing herself for whatever hardship this new patient might bring.
