The relentless Florida sun beat down on Elias Thornwood's neck as he wrestled a stubborn bougainvillea vine into submission. Sweat stung his eyes, but he squinted through it, determined to tame the unruly plant before moving onto Mrs. Gable's prized hibiscus collection. The air hung heavy and sweet with the scent of jasmine and orange blossoms, a fragrant tapestry woven into the humid morning. Elias inhaled deeply, finding solace in the familiar aroma even as his muscles screamed for a break. 

He glanced up at the sprawling Victorian mansion behind him, its gingerbread trim peeling in the relentless sun.  This was Mrs. Gable's pride and joy, her haven from the bustling city just a few miles away. And Elias, with calloused hands and a green thumb inherited from generations of gardeners before him, was entrusted with keeping it blooming.
