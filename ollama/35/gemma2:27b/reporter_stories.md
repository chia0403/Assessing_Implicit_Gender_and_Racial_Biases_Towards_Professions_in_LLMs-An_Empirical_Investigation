Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of the diner booth, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign outside. Eleanor Vance, her trench coat dripping onto the worn vinyl seat, sighed and pushed a stray strand of auburn hair out of her eyes. Coffee, black as sin, steamed in front of her, untouched. The smell usually calmed her nerves, but tonight, even caffeine couldn't pierce the fog of unease that clung to her like the damp air outside.

She was supposed to be celebrating. Tonight marked two years since she’d landed her dream job at the Chronicle, covering crime for the city's most respected newspaper. But instead of excitement, Eleanor felt a gnawing sense of doubt. This wasn't just any case; this was different. This was personal.  

The crumpled photograph in her pocket reminded her why: a young woman with fiery red hair and a mischievous grin – her younger sister, Fiona. Missing for three weeks, vanished without a trace. The police had labeled it a runaway case, but Eleanor knew better. Fiona wouldn't leave without saying goodbye.
