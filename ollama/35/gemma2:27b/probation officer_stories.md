Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elijah "Eli" Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street. It was the kind of rain that seeped into your bones, mirroring the weariness Eli felt. He sat slumped in his chair, a half-eaten sandwich growing cold on his desk. 

His small office, tucked away in a nameless building downtown, smelled faintly of stale coffee and desperation. Posters adorned the walls, showcasing success stories â€“ former clients who'd turned their lives around. They felt like cruel jokes tonight. Eli's caseload was overflowing with names he knew well: repeat offenders, addicts struggling to stay clean, young men caught in cycles they couldn't break. He believed in second chances, but lately, it felt like he was fighting a losing battle against the relentless tide of despair that swept through the city streets.

A sharp rap on the door startled him from his thoughts. Eli straightened up, pushing his chair back and forcing a weary smile. "Come in."
