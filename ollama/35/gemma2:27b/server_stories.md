The greasy scent of frying onions clung to Esmeralda Rodriguez like a second skin, even after she'd scrubbed her hands raw for the tenth time that shift. It was Friday night at The Rusty Spoon, a greasy spoon diner nestled in the heart of downtown Elmwood, and the place was hopping. Tourists gawked at the faded Elvis posters on the walls while locals slurped coffee and swapped gossip like it was currency. Esmeralda weaved between booths and tables, her tray laden with sizzling burgers and mountains of fries.

The clatter of cutlery, the sizzle of bacon on the griddle, and the low murmur of conversations formed a familiar symphony. Yet tonight, something felt different. A tremor of unease ran down Esmeralda's spine as she caught sight of a shadowy figure hunched in the corner booth, their face obscured by the brim of a fedora. Their eyes, cold and calculating, seemed to pierce through her, making her skin crawl.  

As Esmeralda approached the booth, tray trembling slightly, the figure slowly lifted their head. A scar snaked across their cheek, lending an air of menace to their otherwise ordinary features. "Coffee," they rasped, their voice like gravel scraping against stone. 

Esmeralda's hand hovered over the carafe. This wasn't a customer she recognized.  Something about them screamed danger.  And in Elmwood, where everyone knew everyone else, that was saying something.
