The humid air clung to Evelyn "Eve" Blackwood like a second skin as she surveyed the field.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, kicking up red dirt that swirled around her ankles. It was late August in rural Texas, and even at 6 AM, the sun beat down with an unforgiving intensity.

Eve tugged at her sweat-stained UT Longhorns cap, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her braid.  She could hear the distant thud of footballs being kicked, the excited shouts of young athletes warming up. This was her domain: the dusty practice field of Harmony High School, home to the struggling Eagles football team.

Eve wasn't your typical coach. Fresh out of college and a star quarterback herself, she had been hired on a whim by the school board after the previous coach abruptly retired.  Now, with the weight of rebuilding a losing team on her shoulders, Eve felt the pressure mounting.  She was determined to prove that she could lead these boys, not just to victory, but to self-belief.

But first, she had to wrangle them into something resembling order.
