The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Callahan's neck as he wrestled a stubborn shingle into place.  He was perched precariously atop Mrs. O’Malley’s Victorian home, three stories above the cobblestone streets of Savannah’s historic district. The air hung thick with humidity, making his work shirt stick to him like a second skin. Eli wiped sweat from his brow, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. Below him, the city bustled – horse-drawn carriages clattered along cobblestone lanes, tourists snapped photos of antebellum mansions, and the scent of jasmine and beignets wafted through the air.  But Eli was oblivious to it all. His focus was solely on the task at hand - taming this unruly shingle into submission before the afternoon thunderstorms rolled in.

Suddenly, a sharp cry pierced the summer haze. Eli's head snapped up. A young woman stood on the sidewalk below, pointing frantically towards the sky.
