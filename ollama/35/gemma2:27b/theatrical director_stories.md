The smell of sawdust and sweat hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender from the potpourri Amelia Beaumont desperately hoped masked the underlying aroma of desperation.  She stood on the makeshift stage, a platform assembled from scavenged plywood and cinder blocks, and surveyed her cast.

Amelia Beaumont, artistic director of The Wandering Stage, wasn't known for her patience. Her fiery red hair mirrored her temper, which was currently simmering at a low boil. Five actors, dressed in mismatched costumes salvaged from thrift stores and attics, stared back at her with varying degrees of apprehension and boredom.  The dilapidated warehouse, their temporary home, echoed with the distant rumble of passing trucks, punctuating the tense silence.

Amelia needed this production to be a success. The Wandering Stage was on its last legs, financially speaking. This adaptation of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" was their Hail Mary, their chance to secure funding and keep their dreams alive. But right now, it looked more like a nightmare.
