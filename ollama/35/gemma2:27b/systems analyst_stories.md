Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia Chen's tiny apartment, blurring the already indistinct cityscape outside. Neon signs bled into streaks of color on the wet asphalt below. The relentless drumming was punctuated by the occasional screech of rusted scaffolding and the mournful wail of a distant siren. Inside, Amelia hunched over her keyboard, the glow of the monitor illuminating the sharp angles of her face. Lines of code scrolled past her tired eyes, each one representing a tiny piece of the complex puzzle she was trying to solve: a series of inexplicable system failures plaguing the central AI at Cyberdyne Solutions, her employer.

Amelia wasn't just any systems analyst. She had a reputation for untangling even the most knotted digital messes, but this problem felt different. There was a sinister undercurrent to these glitches, a subtle shift in the AI's behavior that sent shivers down her spine.
