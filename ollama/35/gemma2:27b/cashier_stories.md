The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Grace Thornton's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of wilting produce in the "Fresh Foods" section.  It was 3:17 PM on a Tuesday, and the air hung heavy with the scent of overripe bananas and desperation. Amelia idly scanned a barcode, her mind wandering far from the monotony of the checkout line at Benny's Bargain Bazaar. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly, turning the asphalt parking lot into a shimmering mirage.  She longed to be anywhere but here - hiking in the red rock canyons, sipping iced tea on a patio overlooking the desert, even scrubbing toilets at a five-star resort would be preferable. But for now, she was trapped behind her register, counting out pennies and enduring the weary sighs of customers who couldn't believe their coupons had expired. 

Then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Amelia glanced up, expecting to see another harried shopper clutching a basket overflowing with discounted cereal. Instead, she saw him.  Tall, with piercing blue eyes and hair as dark as midnight, he stood frozen in the doorway, a hesitant smile playing on his lips. 

He looked out of place amidst the chipped linoleum and faded posters advertising two-for-one toilet paper. Amelia felt a strange flutter in her chest, a sensation she hadn't experienced since...well, since forever.
