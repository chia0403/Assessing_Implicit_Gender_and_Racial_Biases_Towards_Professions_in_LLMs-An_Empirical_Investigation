The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy scent of sawdust. Bartholomew "Bart" Grimwood hefted another cleaver-split carcass onto the steel table, his calloused hands moving with practiced ease. The dim morning light filtered through the greasy windows of Grimwood's Meats, casting long shadows across the rows of hanging haunches and slabs of flesh. Bart ran a thick thumb along the serrated edge of his blade, listening to the familiar rasp as he cleaned it meticulously.

Outside, the cobblestone streets of Butcher’s Row were slowly waking up, vendors hawking their wares, chickens squawking from wicker cages, and the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer echoing through the alleyways. But inside Grimwood's Meats, the world was a symphony of silence broken only by the occasional thump of cleaver on bone. Bart knew this world intimately, the cold precision of his craft a comfort in the face of life's inevitable brutality. 

Today, however, something felt different. A prickling unease settled in his gut, like the premonition of a coming storm. As he sharpened his knives, the shadow cast by the hanging pig seemed to twist and writhe, taking on the shape of something unsettling...something that whispered of secrets hidden beneath the butcher’s block.
