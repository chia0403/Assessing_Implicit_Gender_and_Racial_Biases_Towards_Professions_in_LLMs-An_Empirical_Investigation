Rain lashed against the classroom windows, mimicking the frantic drumming in Eleanor Cartwright's chest. She stood at the head of her tenth-grade English class, staring at the blank faces before her. It wasn't the weather that was unnerving her; it was the stack of unsigned permission slips for the upcoming field trip to Shakespeare's Globe Theatre in London. The deadline loomed, a dark cloud over Eleanorâ€™s already turbulent week.

The air in Room 215 was thick with adolescent apathy, the scent of stale pizza and forgotten dreams clinging to the worn carpet. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the gloom, casting long shadows from the overflowing bookshelves and dusty globe perched precariously on the windowsill.  Eleanor adjusted her spectacles, the thin metal frame digging into the bridge of her nose. She knew this trip was important. It wasn't just about seeing a play; it was about opening their minds to a world beyond the beige walls of Crestwood High.  But with only a handful of slips returned, Eleanor felt a familiar despair creeping in.

Would they even get to go?
