The sun hammered down on Elias "Eli" Thornton's neck as he wrestled with a recalcitrant sheet of plywood. Sweat beaded on his brow, dripping into his eyes, stinging. He grumbled under his breath, wiping them away with the back of his calloused hand. The air hung thick and humid, smelling faintly of tar and sawdust â€“ the usual symphony of scents on a construction site in mid-July. 

Eli was perched precariously on a scaffold overlooking the bustling cityscape. Below him, the foundations for a new high-rise were taking shape, a skeletal framework reaching towards the hazy blue sky. Cranes groaned and beeped, hauling steel beams and concrete slabs, while workers scurried like ants around the base, their voices barely audible above the din of machinery.

Eli wasn't one for heights, but he knew this job was crucial if he wanted to keep his head above water. His wife, Maria, was due any day now with their first child, and the prospect of fatherhood weighed heavily on him. He needed every cent he could earn, especially with medical bills looming.
