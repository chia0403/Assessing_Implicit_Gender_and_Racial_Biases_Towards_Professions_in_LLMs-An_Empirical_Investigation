Rain lashed against the arched windows of The Gilded Cage, blurring the Parisian skyline into an impressionistic wash of grey and gold. Amelia Rose Dubois sighed, her breath fogging the cool glass.  The sprawling Art Deco apartment, with its intricate mosaic floors and sculpted plaster walls, felt strangely empty despite being crammed full of furniture and objet d'art. It was supposed to be a haven for her latest client, Monsieur Durand, a retired perfumer with a penchant for opulent decadence.

But Amelia couldn’t shake the feeling that something was amiss. The furniture, though impeccably chosen and arranged, lacked a certain je ne sais quoi. The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and vanilla – Durand's signature perfume blend – but it felt more like an artificial mask than genuine comfort.  She knew she had the skills to create breathtaking spaces, but this project felt different. It was as if the apartment itself was resisting her vision.
