The Nevada sun beat down on Evelyn "Eve" Lancaster's shoulders as she prepped her Cessna 172 for takeoff. Dust devils danced across the cracked runway of the abandoned airstrip, their ghostly swirls mirroring the unease churning in Eve's gut. The rusted hulk of a decommissioned B-52 bomber loomed in the distance, a silent sentinel against the azure sky.

Eve ran her hand over the Cessna's worn leather seat, its familiar scent offering a sliver of comfort. This wasn't just another routine cargo run; this was her chance to finally leave behind the ghosts that haunted her dreams and the whispers that followed her every move. Her destination: a remote research outpost nestled deep within the Nevada desert, shrouded in secrecy and fueled by rumors. Eve had no idea what awaited her there, only that she needed to escape the past that threatened to consume her present.

She gripped the yoke, her knuckles white against the worn leather. This flight was more than just a job; it was her lifeline. With a deep breath, Eve pushed the throttle forward and felt the Cessna rumble beneath her, eager to break free from the earthbound chains of doubt and fear.  The runway stretched ahead, beckoning her towards the unknown.

Eve Lancaster was ready to fly.
