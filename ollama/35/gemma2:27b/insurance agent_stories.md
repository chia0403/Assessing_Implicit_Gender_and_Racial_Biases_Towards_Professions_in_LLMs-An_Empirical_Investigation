Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane of Elias Finch's office, blurring the already dismal view of the industrial park. A single flickering fluorescent bulb cast harsh shadows across his cluttered desk, illuminating stacks of claim forms and policy documents. Elias, a man whose perpetually rumpled suit seemed to mirror the state of his soul, sighed and rubbed his tired eyes. He was drowning in paperwork, each file a testament to another misfortune: car accidents, house fires, freak lightning strikes. 

It wasn't that Elias lacked empathy. He genuinely wanted to help people navigate the complexities of insurance, to offer them some solace amidst their troubles. But lately, it felt like every claim was tinged with despair, every interaction leaving him feeling drained and disillusioned. 


Today promised to be no different. The insistent ringing of his phone jolted him back to reality. He glanced at the caller ID: "Unknown." Elias hesitated for a moment before picking up the receiver.  "Elias Finch speaking," he said wearily. A voice, muffled by static, responded, its tone urgent and unsettling.

"Mr. Finch... you need to come to Blackwood Manor. There's been an incident."
