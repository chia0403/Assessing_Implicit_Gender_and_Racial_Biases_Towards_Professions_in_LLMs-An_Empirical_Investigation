Rain hammered against the skylights of Serenity Spa, each drop a tiny drumbeat echoing the frantic rhythm in Elara Solstice's chest.  She gripped the edge of her massage table, knuckles white, as the last client of the day departed. Usually, the soft chime above the door brought Elara a sense of relief, but today, it only amplified the knot of anxiety twisting in her gut.

Serenity Spa, nestled on a quiet side street in Asheville, North Carolina, was more than just a place of work for Elara. It was her sanctuary, her escape from the chaos that had followed her since childhood.  She'd built this business with her own two hands, pouring every ounce of passion and skill into creating a haven of healing touch. But tonight, the walls felt suffocating, the scent of lavender oil acrid in the air.

Her phone buzzed on the reception desk, jolting Elara back to reality. It was a call she'd been dreading – a call from her landlord reminding her that rent was due tomorrow, a sum she hadn't come close to earning this month. The weight of responsibility pressed down on her, threatening to crush the fragile peace she’d so carefully cultivated.

Elara needed a miracle, and fast.
