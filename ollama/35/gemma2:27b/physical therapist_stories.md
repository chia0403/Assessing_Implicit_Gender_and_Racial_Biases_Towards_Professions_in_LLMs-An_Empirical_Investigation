Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the already dreary cityscape beyond. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the sparsely decorated room. Posters depicting anatomical diagrams and healthy posture tips lined the walls, their cheerful colours seeming out of place in the gloomy atmosphere. Eleanor sighed, running a hand through her auburn hair that had escaped its usual bun. It was a Tuesday, which meant another gruelling day filled with back pain sufferers, post-surgery patients, and the occasional athlete pushing their body to the limit.

She glanced at the clock - 8:55 am. Her first appointment, Mr. Henderson, a retired accountant recovering from a hip replacement, was due any minute. Eleanor straightened her crisp white coat and prepared herself for another day of coaxing aching muscles and shattered confidence back to life.
