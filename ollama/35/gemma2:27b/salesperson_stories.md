Rain lashed against the dusty windows of "Second Chance Cars," blurring the neon "OPEN" sign into a swirling mess of pink and green. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Esmeralda "Esme" Delacroix sighed, adjusting her crimson lipstick in the cracked reflection of her phone screen. She hated rainy days. Not only did they scare away customers, but they also made her perpetually damp cardigan smell like mildew. 

Today, Esme needed a sale. Rent was due tomorrow, and her fridge held nothing more promising than a wilted carrot and a jar of questionable pickles.  She eyed the hulking '78 Cadillac Eldorado parked prominently in the lot, its faded metallic blue paint shimmering under the anemic fluorescent lights. Maybe today was the day she'd finally convince someone to see past its rust spots and appreciate its vintage charm.
