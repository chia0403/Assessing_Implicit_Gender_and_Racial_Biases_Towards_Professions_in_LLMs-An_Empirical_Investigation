Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," the rhythmic drumming echoing Emilia Rose Carrington's growing anxiety. Her newest client, Mrs. Beatrice Davenport, was due any minute, and Emilia hadn't quite cracked the code on Beatrice's peculiar dietary restrictions: vegan, gluten-free, sugar-free, but with a peculiar fondness for durian fruit.

Emilia glanced at the clock – 2:57 pm. Beatrice was notoriously punctual, which only amplified Emilia's unease.  She fidgeted with the hand-painted sign on her desk, "Food is medicine, let me show you how." Was it arrogance to believe she could help someone as unique as Beatrice? The cozy atmosphere of her office – adorned with lush houseplants and framed botanical prints – usually calmed her nerves. Today, however, the scent of lavender essential oil couldn't quite mask the fear that Beatrice wouldn't find Emilia's expertise palatable.
