Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Ezekiel "Zeke" Blackwood's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside him. The stale scent of cheap whiskey and regret hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic tick-tock of a grandfather clock that had seen better days – much like Zeke himself.

His office was tucked away on a forgotten side street in New Orleans, where crumbling brick buildings wore their age like faded tattoos.  The French Quarter buzzed with life just a few blocks away, but here, amidst the shadows and peeling paint, the world seemed to stand still. 

A single dim bulb cast long, grotesque shadows across Zeke's cluttered desk: overflowing ashtrays, stacks of dusty files, and a half-empty bottle of rye beckoning him like an old friend. He ran a hand through his unruly gray hair, squinting at the photograph on his desk. A young woman with eyes that sparkled even in black and white stared back – Claire Moreau. She'd vanished without a trace three weeks ago, leaving behind only whispers and unanswered questions.
