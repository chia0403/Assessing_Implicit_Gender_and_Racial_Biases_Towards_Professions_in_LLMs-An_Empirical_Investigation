Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Cartwright's third-grade classroom, mimicking the frantic beating of her own heart. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an unsettling glow on the normally cheery yellow walls plastered with misspelled spelling words and lopsided crayon drawings.  It was 3:15 p.m., a full fifteen minutes past dismissal, and the only sound besides the relentless rain was the ticking of the clock and Eleanor's ragged breaths.

The empty desks were eerily silent, each one a testament to the children who usually filled them with laughter and boundless energy. Today, however, those desks remained vacant. A note pinned to the door from Principal Thompson read: "School closed early due to unexpected weather conditions. Please ensure all students are safely collected." 

But Eleanor's heart sank with every tick of the clock.  One student remained unaccounted for: nine-year-old Daniel Peterson, a shy boy who often lingered after class, captivated by stories of faraway lands and mythical creatures. A shiver ran down her spine as she remembered Daniel mentioning he lived alone with his grandmother, who struggled with arthritis and rarely ventured out in bad weather.

Eleanor grabbed her raincoat from the back of the door, a sudden sense of urgency propelling her towards the rain-soaked streets.
