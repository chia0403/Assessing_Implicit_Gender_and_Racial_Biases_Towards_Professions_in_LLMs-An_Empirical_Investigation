Rain hammered against the grimy windows of St. Jude’s Free Clinic, blurring the neon sign that flickered intermittently: "Compassionate Care For All." Inside, Eloise Amelia Cartwright adjusted her surgical mask, its floral pattern clashing magnificently with her lime green scrubs. The air hung thick with disinfectant and the faint metallic tang of blood. It was a Tuesday afternoon, which meant overflowing waiting rooms and a steady stream of patients needing their vitals checked before they saw the overworked doctor.

Eloise sighed. Phlebotomy wasn’t exactly glamorous, but it paid the bills and allowed her to help people in a small, tangible way. She found solace in the precision of drawing blood, the quiet hum of the centrifuge, the delicate dance of veins beneath the skin. 


Today, however, something felt different. A palpable tension pulsed through the clinic, carried on the worried whispers of the patients and the harried steps of the nurses. Eloise couldn't shake a sense of foreboding that prickled at the back of her neck. As she prepped a vial for the next patient, a shadow fell across the doorway. A man stood there, tall and gaunt, his face obscured by the shadows cast from the brim of his hat. His eyes, cold and piercing, met Eloise's, sending a shiver down her spine.

This wasn't just any Tuesday at St. Jude’s. Something was amiss.
