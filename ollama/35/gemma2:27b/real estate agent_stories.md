The humid Miami air clung to Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz like a second skin as she navigated the crowded street vendors and honking scooters towards her next showing. Palm trees swayed languidly overhead, their fronds casting dappled shadows on the pastel-hued buildings that lined Ocean Drive. Esme, however, was far from relaxed. Today's client was notorious for being difficult - a wealthy tech mogul with impossibly high standards and a reputation for walking away at the slightest inconvenience. This penthouse overlooking South Beach had better be perfect, or her commission would evaporate faster than the ocean mist under the blazing sun.

Taking a deep breath, Esme straightened her crisp white linen blouse and plastered on her most dazzling smile. Time to impress Mr. Vanderlyn.
