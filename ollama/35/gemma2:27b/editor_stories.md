The smell of old paper and ink was Amelia Blackwood's comfort zone. Her cramped office, tucked away on the third floor of a building that hadn't seen a renovation since the 1970s, was her sanctuary. The yellowing wallpaper peeled at the seams, revealing faded brick underneath, and sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windows in dusty shafts. Amelia preferred it this way. It felt authentic, like the stories she poured over day after day.

Today, a manuscript lay open on her desk, its pages dog-eared and marked with frantic scribbles. "The Shadow of the Ancients," it was titled, promising an epic fantasy adventure. Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples. The prose was clunky, the plot convoluted, but there was a spark in it, something raw and untamed that whispered of potential.  Could she polish this rough gem into something truly special?
