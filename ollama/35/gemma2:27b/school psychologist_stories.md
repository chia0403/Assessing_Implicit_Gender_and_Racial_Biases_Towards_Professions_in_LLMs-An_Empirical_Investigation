Rain lashed against the warped windowpane, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Thorne's chest. The flickering fluorescent lights of Westbridge Elementary hummed an anxious melody, amplifying the tension coiled in her gut. 

It was Friday afternoon, the air thick with the anticipation of freedom. But for Amelia, school psychologist and self-proclaimed "child whisperer," the day felt far from over.  Across from her desk sat ten-year-old Leo Harrison, his freckled face crumpled in a mask of despair. His usually bright blue eyes were dull and distant, reflecting the turmoil that had brought him to Amelia's office. 

Westbridge Elementary, with its peeling paint and echoing hallways, felt like a vessel adrift in a sea of forgotten promises. It was a place where dreams struggled to bloom amidst overcrowded classrooms and underfunded resources. But for Amelia, it was a lifeline, a haven where she could fight for the well-being of children like Leo, whose silent struggles often went unnoticed.
