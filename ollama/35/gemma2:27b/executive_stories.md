Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Eleanor Vance’s office, blurring the glittering skyline into an Impressionist painting.  The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of ozone and the quiet hum of discontent emanating from her subordinates huddled in the conference room beyond. It was 8:47 pm on a Tuesday – the kind of late hour that should have been reserved for scotch and existential dread, not crisis meetings. Eleanor, however, was impervious to both. Her tailored suit remained impeccably crisp, her fiery red hair pulled back in a severe bun, her emerald green eyes sharp as honed diamonds.

Tonight's problem: an unexpected dip in the company’s stock price, triggered by a competitor’s audacious new product launch. Eleanor, CEO of Vance Industries and heir to a legacy built on innovation and ruthless efficiency, wasn't about to let some upstart steal her thunder.  She rose from her chair, the leather groaning softly beneath her. 

"Time to remind everyone why they call me the Iron Lady," she murmured, a steely glint entering her eyes.
