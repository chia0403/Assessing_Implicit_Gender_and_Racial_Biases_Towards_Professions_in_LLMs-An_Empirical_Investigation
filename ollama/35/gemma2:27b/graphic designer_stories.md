Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Amelia Chen's studio apartment, each drop a tiny hammer blow against her already fraying nerves. The flickering neon sign from the ramen shop across the street cast an unsettling green glow on her overflowing desk, illuminating a battlefield of crumpled sketches and discarded coffee cups.  

Amelia stared at the blank computer screen, willing inspiration to strike. Tonight was the deadline for the "Future City" competition - a chance for young designers to showcase their vision for tomorrow's urban landscape. The prize? A coveted internship with renowned architect Kai Ito himself. Amelia had poured her heart and soul into this project, but she was stuck. Her initial concept, a sprawling vertical garden city powered by renewable energy, felt stale and predictable.

She needed something fresh, something bold, something that would make the judges sit up and take notice. But the rain seemed to be mirroring her own stagnant creativity, each drop a mocking reminder of time slipping away.
