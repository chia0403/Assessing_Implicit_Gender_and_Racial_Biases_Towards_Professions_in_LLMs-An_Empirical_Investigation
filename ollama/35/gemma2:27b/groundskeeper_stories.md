The morning mist clung to Rosalind Hawthorne's weathered face as she surveyed the sprawling gardens of Blackwood Manor. Dawn painted the sky in soft hues of rose and lavender, illuminating the dew-kissed petals of the roses she meticulously tended. The air was heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and damp earth, a familiar symphony that calmed her troubled soul.

For decades, Rosalind had been the sole caretaker of these magnificent grounds, tending to each bloom and shrub with unwavering dedication. She knew every twist and turn of the manicured pathways, the secret whispers of the ancient willow tree by the pond, and the precise rhythm of the fountain's gentle spray. But lately, a disquiet had settled upon her. Strange occurrences plagued the manor: flickering lights in the dead of night, disembodied whispers carried on the wind, and an unnerving chill that seemed to follow her through the labyrinthine gardens.
