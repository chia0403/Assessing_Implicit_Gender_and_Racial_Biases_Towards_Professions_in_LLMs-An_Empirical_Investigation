Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the community center, blurring the cityscape beyond into a watercolour wash of greys and blues. Inside, fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn linoleum floor. Amelia Reyes, her dark curls escaping their haphazard bun, adjusted the height of a parallel bar with a sigh. The air was thick with the scent of disinfectant and damp wool. 

Amelia wasn't sure why she bothered coming anymore.  The cramped space, the lack of equipment, the apathetic stares from some of her clients - it all felt like an uphill battle against futility. Yet, there was something about seeing a flicker of hope in a patient's eyes, a hesitant first step taken with newfound confidence, that kept Amelia tethered to this thankless job. Today, she hoped, would be one of those days.
