The biting wind whipped across Silas Blackwood's face, carrying with it the scent of brine and something else, something faintly metallic that set his teeth on edge. He hunched further into his threadbare cloak, pulling the heavy hood tighter around his head. The flickering gaslights of the Watchtower cast long, grotesque shadows against the cobblestone walls, making the already unsettling landscape seem even more sinister.

Silas Blackwood was a man weathered by years spent staring down the abyss. His eyes, the colour of storm clouds, held a weary wisdom that belied his youthful thirty-two years. A scar, jagged and white, ran from his temple to his jawline, a grim reminder of a past encounter he'd rather forget. He clutched the hilt of his sword, its familiar weight offering him a meager sense of comfort in this desolate place.

He stood atop the crumbling battlements overlooking the Whispering Sea, an expanse of murky water that seemed to devour the light. The ancient legends spoke of creatures lurking beneath its surface, monstrous leviathans with scales black as night and eyes glowing with malevolent fire. Silas scoffed at such tales, dismissing them as sailor's superstition. Still, he couldn't help but feel a prickle of unease as he scanned the horizon for any sign of movement. 

Tonight felt different. The air crackled with an unseen energy, the waves crashing against the rocks with unnatural ferocity. Even the gulls had vanished, leaving an eerie silence broken only by the mournful cry of the wind.
