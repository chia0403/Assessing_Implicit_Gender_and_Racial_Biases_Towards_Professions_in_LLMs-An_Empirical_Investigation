The bell above the door chimed its familiar, high-pitched song as Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzwilliam adjusted his spectacles and peered over the rim of his newspaper. Outside, a steady drizzle painted the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh in shades of grey, mirroring the gloom that had settled over Bart's shop for weeks. 

His once bustling barber shop, “Bart’s Blades,” now sat mostly empty. The familiar rhythm of snipping scissors and buzzing clippers had been replaced by an unnerving silence punctuated only by the ticking of the antique grandfather clock in the corner.  Even the scent of bay rum and shaving cream, usually so comforting, seemed to hang heavy in the air, a constant reminder of better days. 

Bart sighed, setting down his newspaper and straightening the faded velvet cape draped over his worn barber chair. He'd been a fixture in this neighbourhood for over forty years, trimming the hair of generations of men. But lately, something had changed. The young lads preferred the trendy salons downtown, while the older gentlemen seemed content with letting their silver locks grow wild.

Today, Bart was expecting only one customer -  Mr. Alistair MacDougall, a gruff but loyal client who insisted on getting his hair cut every Thursday. Bart hoped Alistair wouldn't notice the tremor in his hand as he prepared his tools, for Bart had a secret gnawing at him, one that threatened to shatter the routine and familiarity of his life.
