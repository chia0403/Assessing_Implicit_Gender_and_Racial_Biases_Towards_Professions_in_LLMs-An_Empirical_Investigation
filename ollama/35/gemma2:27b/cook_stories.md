The air hung thick with the scent of caramelized onions and woodsmoke, a familiar comfort to Elara Devereux. Her small kitchen, nestled in the heart of the ancient forest bordering the village of Oakhaven, was ablaze with activity. Pots bubbled merrily on the stovetop, their contents promising a feast fit for kings. Outside, the wind whispered through the gnarled branches of ancient oaks, carrying with it the promise of rain and the distant hoot of an owl. Elara hummed along to a forgotten tune, her hands working deftly as she kneaded dough for her famous sourdough bread, each movement ingrained from years of practice. Tonight was the annual Harvest Festival in Oakhaven, and Elara, renowned throughout the land for her culinary artistry, was tasked with preparing the grand feast.
