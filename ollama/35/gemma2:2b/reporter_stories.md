## The City That Never Sleeps

**Setting:**  Neon-drenched 1950s Chicago - The glittering towers of downtown pierce the smog-filled sky while jazz riffs spill from dingy cafes and smoky backrooms. This city never sleeps. Not for reporters, not for gangsters, not for anyone trying to find their way in this concrete jungle.

**Character:**  Amelia "Amy" Thorne -  Her hair is a mess of auburn curls usually pulled back in a messy bun but today it’s escaping its confines, framing her determined face with an urgency that mirrors the city's own pulse. A reporter for the Chicago Sun-Times since graduation, Amy is driven by a relentless pursuit of the truth, fueled by childhood stories about police brutality and systemic corruption. Today, she has one shot at finding out if the whispers are true –  the truth behind the disappearance of notorious mobster “Big” Tony Falcone. 

**Opening:**

The stale coffee tasted like regret in Amy's mouth as she stared down at the faded "Black Cat" bar from her worn-out taxi seat. The air hung thick with cigar smoke and the faint scent of desperation, a perfume that seemed to cling to this city's underbelly.  Big Tony Falcone’s last known location was this very establishment. His sudden vanishing act had sent shockwaves through Chicago's underworld - and for Amy, it felt personal. Her own father, a cop lost on the same beat years ago, whispered in her sleep: "The city has its secrets, Amy." 

The bar door creaked open like a tired sigh, revealing a sea of shadowy figures huddled over drinks and hushed conversations.  A lone man stood out – tall and imposing, his fedora casting a shadow that devoured the rest of him. His eyes, however, were burning bright - an intense, almost predatory glare. 

“You're Amy Thorne, right?” he asked in a voice like gravel sliding down old concrete. “We got something for you.”
