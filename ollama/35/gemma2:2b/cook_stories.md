The rain hammered against the cobblestones, each drop exploding in miniature fireworks on the grimy asphalt. Inside "The Rusty Spoon", Eloise Beaumont - known as El to those who knew her well - was battling a storm on a much larger scale than the one outside. Her usually calm kitchen was a whirlwind of flour dust and simmering pots, the aroma of her latest creation –  a pumpkin risotto with sage and burnt butter – competing with the acrid scent of burnt sugar from a failed attempt at gingerbread cookies. The storm had rolled in just as she’d finished preparing the last batch of her famous apple crumble, leaving El to face an onslaught of impatient customers and mounting anxieties. 

The old bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival. It was Mr. Thorne, her most frequent and difficult customer. Always clad in his tailored overcoat and perpetually grumpy expression, he wouldn't admit it even if he tripped over a stray cat and fell flat on his face. But El knew better. He liked to complain about the weather, the quality of the coffee (though she swore it was perfectly brewed), and how the only reason anyone ever visited her tiny, unassuming eatery was because they couldn’t get into the fancy restaurants in the city. 

“El,” Mr. Thorne grunted, his voice a low rumble like thunder rolling across a distant mountain range. "What's cooking?"
