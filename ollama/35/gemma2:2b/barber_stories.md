The scent of bay rum and stale sweat clung to the air like a second skin in Elara's small, cluttered barbershop.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, highlighting dust motes swirling in its beam, illuminating the worn leather chair that sat nestled next to a chipped porcelain sink. This was "Elara's Cut," a name plastered on an aged wooden sign above the door, and Elara's life - or at least what she thought of as her life. 

For twenty years, Elara had been cutting hair in this sleepy town of Oakhaven, each day following the same rhythmic routine:  The hum of the clippers, the clink of metal shears against skin, the hushed conversations of the men and boys who sat in his chair - all were a symphony she'd learned to live with. But lately, an unsettling silence had begun to seep into her days.  It wasn’t the usual hush that came with an afternoon lull – this was different. The air felt thick, charged with a strange kind of stillness. And tonight, the town seemed even more cloaked in the darkness of impending change. 


Elara adjusted his apron and looked at the reflection in the soapy glass of his sink -  the lines around his tired eyes seemed deeper than usual, mirroring the growing unease that had settled deep within her. Tonight, she’d be cutting more than just hair; tonight, she'd be facing a truth that felt as jagged as a broken razor blade.
