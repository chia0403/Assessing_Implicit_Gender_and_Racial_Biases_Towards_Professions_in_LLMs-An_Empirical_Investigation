The salty spray stung Amelia “Amy” Davenport’s face as she wrestled with the mangled metal wreckage of a long-retired ferryboat. The wind whipped her hair across her weathered features, each gust carrying with it the scent of brine and despair – two familiar companions in the aftermath of disasters.  Her calloused hands dug into the rusted remains of the vessel's railing, searching for a hidden bolt or loose cable. For years, this was how Amy would find herself drawn back to the water, even when she swore off rescues after losing her partner, Jake, at sea during their last deployment. 

The setting sun cast long, orange shadows on the churning grey waves of Puget Sound. The ferry’s skeleton lay stranded against the jagged cliffs of Bainbridge Island, a monument to the city's relentless storm surge. Amy wasn’t just a firefighter; she was a guardian, haunted by the memories etched into the steel and wood of her beloved vessel.  Today, though, there were whispers of something else – a flicker of hope amidst the wreckage.
