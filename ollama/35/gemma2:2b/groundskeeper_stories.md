The air hung thick with the smell of decaying leaves and damp earth as Barnaby Thistlewick adjusted his worn brown cap.  He hated this time of year – autumn. It marked the slow decline of the vibrant green that had dominated Evergreene manor's landscape all summer, replaced by a melancholic palette of browns, golds, and reds. As he surveyed the vast expanse of overgrown meadows behind the sprawling estate, Barnaby shivered. Not from the cool October air, but from the gnawing unease that clung to him like morning mist.

Evergreene was a relic, its grandeur fading into the shadows of time. The once manicured grounds now resembled an unruly garden – tangled blackberry bushes clambered towards the crumbling stone walls, while ancient oaks and sycamores stood sentinel over overgrown paths. Barnaby, the lone groundskeeper entrusted with its maintenance, had grown intimately familiar with its secrets – whispers carried on the wind, forgotten paths leading to places no man should tread. 

He was a quiet, unassuming figure, his face weathered by years spent battling weeds and dealing with the occasional eccentric guest.  But as he gazed at the manor’s imposing façade - now draped in heavy drapes that concealed the dust-laden rooms from view – Barnaby couldn't shake the feeling of being watched.
