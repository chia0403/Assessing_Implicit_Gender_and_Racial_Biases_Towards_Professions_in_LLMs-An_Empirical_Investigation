## The Sky's Canvas: Story Opening

**Setting:** A luxury transatlantic Boeing 777, soaring above the clouds at 35,000 feet.  The cabin shimmers with its signature in-flight lighting and plush velvet seats. The hum of the engines blends seamlessly with the soft murmur of conversations in hushed tones as passengers drift into a state of relaxation amidst the serene atmosphere.

**Character:** Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, a flight attendant with eyes as bright as the sapphire skies she navigates. Amy exudes quiet confidence as she effortlessly moves through the cabin, tending to her passengers with an intuitive grace that has made her one of the most sought-after flight attendants on this particular route. 

**Story opening:** "Another glass of champagne, Mrs. Evans?" Amy's voice was a soothing melody amidst the soft murmur of conversation. Her fingers delicately lifted the delicate flute, her gaze lingering on the elegant lady before her with the kind eyes and silver smile that spoke volumes about years lived well.  "Or perhaps something stronger? We have some exquisite single-malt Scotch here, if you'd prefer." 

The old lady chuckled softly. "Champagne, dear Amy.  A touch of the sky's canvas, wouldn't you say?" she mused, her eyes meeting Amy's with a knowing warmth. The faintest hint of melancholy played upon her lips as she took a sip, her gaze drifting towards the clouds that were beginning to swirl into an intricate dance against the backdrop of the setting sun.

Amy smiled back, her heart filled with a quiet understanding of the womanâ€™s inner world. "Just how I like it," she said softly, placing the champagne flute down and stepping away from the passenger's table.  "But don't let yourself get lost in the clouds, Mrs. Evans. There's still quite a journey ahead of us."
