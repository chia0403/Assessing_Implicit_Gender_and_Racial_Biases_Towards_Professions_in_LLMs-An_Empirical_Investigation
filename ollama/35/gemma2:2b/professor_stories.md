## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  The sprawling library of Oakhaven University, nestled amidst rolling hills and ancient oaks in Vermont's charming Green Mountain region. 

A thick silence pressed down on Professor Amelia "Amy" Blackwood as she navigated the labyrinthine shelves, her worn leather satchel slung across her shoulder. Dust motes danced in the afternoon sunlight that slanted through the arched windows, illuminating faded portraits of long-gone professors and whispering secrets of forgotten tomes.  She had always felt a kinship with these silent witnesses to time, their ages etched upon the wood and paper of centuries past.

**Opening:** 

Professor Blackwood, renowned for her meticulous research on Victorian literature and her sharp wit, was drawn to Oakhaven's grand library for its unique collection.  It wasn't just the towering shelves or the fragrant air of aged parchment that beckoned; it was a faint hum she felt in the walls themselves – a subtle thrumming, like an echo of long-silenced voices whispering tales yet untold. A shiver ran down her spine as she reached for a volume, its cover bearing a faded illustration of a raven perched on a crumbling castle.  "The Raven's Prophecy," the title read in elegant script. Amy knew this was no ordinary library – it held within its walls an ancient energy that seemed to beckon her forward, promising both revelation and perhaps a little danger. 

**Note:** This opening sets up several key elements for your story:
* **Mysterious setting:** The whispering walls and the unseen energy suggest something more than just bookshelves.
* **Conflicted character:** Amy is a professor seeking knowledge, but there's a hint of unease in her demeanor, suggesting she might be dealing with something beyond academic research. 
* **Intrigue and danger:**  The title and the faint hum create anticipation for an unfolding mystery and possibly even some form of conflict.
