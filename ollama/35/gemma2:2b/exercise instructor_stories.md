The midday sun hammered down on the gleaming steel gym floor, casting stark shadows as if trying to outwit the heat itself. A thick haze hung in the air, punctuated by bursts of sweat-slicked bodies shifting and groaning through their routines.  This was Amelia's domain - a symphony of grunts, clangs, and rhythmic pounding that pulsed like an unseen heartbeat. 

Amelia "Storm" Harrington, owner and head instructor at the Ironclad Gym, surveyed her space with the practiced eye of a seasoned storm chaser.  Her signature teal-and-silver leotard clung to her lean frame as she moved from one corner to another. Today's class was in full swing - a mix of young twenty-somethings eager for an edge and veterans weathered by time and countless workouts, their bodies moving with the grace born from years of dedication. 

Her eyes caught on a new face nestled amongst the regulars: a timid woman with eyes wide and uncertain. Amelia’s lips curled into a slight smile as she approached, a warm wave of familiarity washing over her. “Welcome,” Amelia said, her voice a gentle rumble against the din of the gym.  “First time here? We don’t bite… well, not too hard.” She gestured with a practiced flick of her wrist towards the open door that led into the heart of the workout zone. “Ready to storm?”
