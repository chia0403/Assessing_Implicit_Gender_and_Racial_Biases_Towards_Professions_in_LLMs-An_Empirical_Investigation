## The Whispering Saw

**Setting:**  A tiny workshop tucked away in the heart of Prague’s Old Town, cobblestone streets echoing with the rhythmic clatter of hammers on wood. The air hung heavy with sawdust and the faint scent of birch tar. 

**Character:** **Jan Veselý**, a man whose age was as hard-worn as his oak bench.  His hands were gnarled and weathered like ancient tree roots, each calloused finger capable of shaping wood to life – or carving it into something beautiful and terrifyingly real. For twenty years he’d carved his livelihood in the workshop's shadows, known only by the whispers of the saw he held dearest: The “Whisperer.”  

**Opening:**

A sliver of dawn bled through the grimy windowpanes as Jan stirred, pulling on the tattered apron that clung to his lean frame like a second skin. He ran his calloused fingers along the worn wood of the Whisperer, the familiar weight comforting. This was his sanctuary, his world of knots and grain, where the language of wood whispered secrets he understood all too well. 

He glanced at the clock on the wall – 6:00 am sharp, just as his father had insisted. But today wasn’t like other days. The air held a peculiar tension, an undercurrent of unease that made the Whisperer seem to hum against his calloused palm.  The old saw, usually content with its silent symphony, was singing out a discordant tune. Something was wrong in Prague's quiet cobblestone streets today.
