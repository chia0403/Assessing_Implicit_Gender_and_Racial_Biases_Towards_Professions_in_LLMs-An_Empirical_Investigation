## Setting: 

A bustling city street bathed in the hazy orange glow of a late summer sunset. Neon signs cast flickering shadows on the cobblestones, reflecting the nervous energy rippling through the crowd.  The air crackles with anticipation and the scent of cheap pizza wafting from a nearby kiosk. This is Prague, Czech Republic, where history whispers from every corner and magic seems to linger in the evening breeze.

## Main Character: 

**Name:** Elias "Eli" Kovacs
**Profession:** Emergency Medical Care (EMR) Technician with the city's specialized trauma team.

**Story Opening:**

The red siren on his jacket bag pulsed in rhythm with Eli’s racing heart, mimicking the frantic beat of his own pulse. He gripped the handle of a heavy wheeled stretcher, its worn rubber squeaking against the cobblestones as he navigated through the throngs of people heading home from work. The air vibrated with a cacophony of languages and the rumble of trams. Eli's eyes scanned the street ahead, his gaze flitting from panicked faces to shadowed corners before landing on an older woman huddled under a bus stop shelter.  Her face was pale, her shoulders slumped against a worn coat. 

She clutched a dog-eared handbag, its contents visible only in glimpses through a gap between two cracked leather panels. A thick fog of anxiety rolled off her like the damp chill clinging to the evening air. 

"Just stay with me," Eli muttered under his breath, adjusting his gloves and checking the pulse on the woman's wrist. "We’re gonna be okay."  But as he took a step closer, the weight of her story settled heavily upon him.
