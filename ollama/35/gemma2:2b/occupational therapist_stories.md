The humid Miami air hung thick and heavy as Evelyn "Eve" Thorne adjusted her oversized sunglasses. It was August, and even at the beach, the heat refused to yield its grip on the city. Eve's patient, Mrs. Perez, sat by the water’s edge, a faded floral print dress clinging tightly to her frail frame.  She watched the ocean with wide, glassy eyes as if trying to catch a glimpse of something just beyond reach, while Eve struggled to decipher the source of the underlying fear that seemed to cloud Mrs. Perez's usually sunny disposition. 

It wasn’t unusual for Mrs. Perez to be withdrawn after her recent hospitalization for pneumonia. It was more peculiar seeing the usually vibrant woman struggling with this new level of helplessness.  Eve, armed with a well-worn toolbox of exercises and techniques, had been tasked with helping Mrs. Perez regain some semblance of normalcy, though even she wasn't sure what that meant anymore. 

The scene was a stark contrast to the usual lively atmosphere in Eve’s small office back in Coral Gables. There were days when her work felt like a beacon of hope, guiding patients towards regaining their independence and confidence after a traumatic event.  But today, with Mrs. Perez's case unfolding like a puzzle she couldn’t quite solve, Eve found herself grappling with an uncertainty that seemed to be spreading faster than the humid air itself.
