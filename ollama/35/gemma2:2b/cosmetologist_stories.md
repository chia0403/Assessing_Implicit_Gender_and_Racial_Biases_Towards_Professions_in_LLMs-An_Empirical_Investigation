Rain lashed against the windows of "The Velvet Petal," a vintage salon nestled in the heart of old San Francisco.  Moonlight spilled through gauzy curtains onto the worn, burgundy carpet as Amelia "Amy" Sinclair, a seasoned cosmetologist with eyes like polished amethyst and hands that coaxed beauty from even the most defiant strands of hair, swept a stray strand of auburn out of her client's face.  It was 2:30 am, a time when the city seemed to hold its breath before shedding the cloak of night for the dawnâ€™s gentle blush.

"The world sleeps," she murmured, tucking a curl behind her client's ear. "And you," she added softly, leaning in close,  "need a little bit of magic."
