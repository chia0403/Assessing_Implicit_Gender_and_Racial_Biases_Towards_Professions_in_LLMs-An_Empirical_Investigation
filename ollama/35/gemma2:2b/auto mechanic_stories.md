The smell of oil and burnt rubber was familiar to Elias "El" Thorne like a song he’d been humming since he was knee-high to a grasshopper. The grease under his nails wasn't just grime; it was history, testament to years spent beneath the hood of countless cars.  His little shop, “Thorne's Garage,” perched on the edge of Willow Creek, had weathered its share of storms and seen more engines come alive than die-offs. 

Today, however, was a different kind of storm brewing. The rain was coming down in sheets, drumming a frantic rhythm on the corrugated roof of his shop. Elias squinted out at it through the wind whipping across the parking lot. It wasn't just the weather; there was something else about the air, a tension that clung to it like last-minute engine oil.  The front door creaked open with the force of a disgruntled gust, and in walked a woman, dripping wet and clutching a small, crumpled suitcase. 

**“Mr. Thorne,”** she said, her voice trembling slightly.  "I need help."
