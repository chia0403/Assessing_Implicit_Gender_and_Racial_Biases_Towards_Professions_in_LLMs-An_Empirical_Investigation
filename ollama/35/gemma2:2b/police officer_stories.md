Rain lashed against the windows of Officer Elijah Pierce's patrol car, each drop echoing like tiny drumbeats against the glass. The fluorescent light overhead buzzed in his ears, its sterile hum punctuated by the crackle of static from his radio. He was on the edge of Elmwood Park – a grimy patch known for late-night drug deals and even more nefarious secrets. Tonight, though, it seemed to be holding its breath before something inevitable spilled out like cheap whiskey - an uneasy anticipation that clung to the damp air like fog in the depths of winter. 

The call had been a short one: "Suspect fleeing the scene, possible armed," it rasped from his partner's voice on the radio. A quick scan of the address confirmed it – Mrs. Henderson's house. Old woman known for her baking, her kindness to stray cats, and her peculiar aversion to anyone coming near after sundown.  

Elijah shifted in his seat, the rain blurring the lights of Elmwood's street corner into a kaleidoscope of greys and blues. A shiver ran down his spine as he thought about Mrs. Henderson's story – an old woman alone with a cat for company, robbed at gunpoint, just hours before. The weight of her silence felt heavier than any threat she might have faced.
