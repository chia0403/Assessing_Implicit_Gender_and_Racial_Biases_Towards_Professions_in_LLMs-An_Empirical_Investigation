The air hung thick with the sticky scent of grape juice and freshly cut crayons in Mrs. Eleanor Bellweather’s classroom at Maplewood Elementary. Sunlight streamed through the windows, painting squares of light on the rainbow-colored rug where 12 pairs of tiny feet danced between playdough mountains and a miniature cityscape constructed from cardboard boxes.  Mrs. Bellweather, her neatly braided hair escaping its confines as she leaned over to help little Timmy balance his giant giraffe, sighed contentedly. It was a typical Tuesday in her world, one filled with the chaotic symphony of 5-year-olds and the constant thrumming of their boundless energy.

But today felt different. A tension, unseen but palpable, hung in the air, crackling like static electricity between Mrs. Bellweather's usual bubbly optimism and the quiet unease that had gripped the school since yesterday morning’s announcement. The news:  Mr. Henderson, the beloved kindergarten principal, was leaving for a new job in another state.
