Rain lashed against the windows of "Serenity Dental," blurring the already dim light from outside into an even more muted greyness. Inside, Amelia “Amy” Grant ran a practiced hand over her patient's mouth as she meticulously worked through her checklist. The air hummed with the quiet whirring of the ultrasonic cleaner and the rhythmic clicks of the electric scaler. Outside the storm raged on, but inside, Amy felt strangely calm. It wasn't just the familiar comfort of routine that brought a sense of peace; it was the way the storm seemed to mirror the storm brewing within her own soul.

She’d been working at Serenity Dental for five years – five years of meticulously cleaning teeth and chasing away cavities, five years of trying to piece together the fragments of what once had been. The loss of her husband, David, two years ago still felt fresh and raw like a newly-planted wound. Now, with each patient's appointment, Amy felt both a familiar pang of longing for someone she could no longer see, and a fierce determination to rebuild the life that they’d dreamt together.
