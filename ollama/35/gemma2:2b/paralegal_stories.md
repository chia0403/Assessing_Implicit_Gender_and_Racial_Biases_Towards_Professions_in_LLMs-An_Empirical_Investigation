## The Case of the Disappearing Documents

**Setting:** 
A bustling law firm in New York City, known for its high-profile clients and even higher stakes. 

**Characters:**

* **Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes:**  An intelligent and dedicated paralegal with a sharp wit and an unwavering sense of justice. She's been working at Miller & Thorne, her dream job after graduating from Columbia Law School, for three years now. 

**Opening:**
The smell of stale coffee and desperation hung in the air like a fog as Ellie stared at the pile of documents on her desk. Not just *any* documents – these were blueprints, case files, financial records – everything related to the ongoing battle over the Manhattan skyline's most coveted piece of land: The Grand Meridian Estate.  

Ellie had been meticulously organizing the "chaos" - a term coined by her senior partner, Mr. Thorne himself, for the overwhelming volume of papers in this sprawling skyscraper he called “the heart” of his firm. But it felt more like chaos today. 
Something was terribly wrong. The Grand Meridian case always carried a tangible weight – not just from its legal complexities, but because of the impact it had on people's lives. Today, that weight was heavier than usual. 

Ellie had noticed something missing: a vital set of blueprints - the ones crucial to proving the defendant's liability in their lawsuit against the city council for environmental negligence. A few days ago, she’d found them open at her desk and double-checked, but they were gone now.  

The silence was unsettling. The usual hum of phones ringing, emails buzzing, and murmurs of legal strategy seemed to have faded into a low-frequency drone. 
**Ellie's eyes darted around the room, taking in the tension that hung like smoke in the air. A feeling prickled at her skin - a sense of dread she couldn’t quite place.**  It was time for the next step: **She needed answers – and fast.**
