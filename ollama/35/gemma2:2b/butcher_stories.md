The morning mist hung heavy in the air like a shroud over Blackwood's Market, swallowing the gaslights in their own spectral light before they even flickered on.  Inside "McAllister's Meats", Bertram McAllister's weathered hands moved with an almost hypnotic grace as he sliced through a hindquarter of lamb. His face, creased by years spent staring into the abyss of fat and bone, was half-illuminated by the crimson glow of the butcher block where the meat lay. 

Blackwood's Market had always been a tight-knit place, its aroma of charring wood, sweat, and fresh blood mingling in an intoxicating cocktail. This morning, however, Bertram felt the weight of something deeper than his usual weary sigh.  He was expecting a visitor. Not a regular customer - this wasn't one of the regulars who would stop by for their weekly cuts of venison or a pound of sausage. No, this was someone else entirely. Someone with an aura he couldn't quite place, who made his pulse quicken as he entered the shop, his shadow stretching long and thin across the worn floorboards.
