The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Coach Amelia "Ace" Lawson like an unwelcome second skin.  Even after years coaching the high school's undefeated track team, she felt as though she was perpetually trapped in this humid Georgia swamp. Her whistle screamed into the sweltering air, jarring the quiet of pre-dawn practice. The setting sun cast long, ominous shadows across the worn-out track, highlighting the chipped paint and cracked lines. Ace surveyed her team huddled near the starting block - a mix of nervous anticipation and simmering competitiveness. 

A year ago, she'd been forced to watch from the sidelines as the school’s star sprinter, Jackson "Jax" Harris, had fallen off the track with an injury.  Her usual fire was dampened. Now, fueled by a burning ambition to rebuild the team and reclaim the lost glory, Ace's eyes burned with a fierce resolve.
