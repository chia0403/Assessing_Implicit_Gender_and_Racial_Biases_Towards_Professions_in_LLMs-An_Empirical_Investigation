Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Blackwood Library, each drop exploding in tiny shards of light on the worn mahogany shelves. Inside, the air was thick with the scent of aged paper and forgotten stories, punctuated by the rhythmic clicks of Eleanor Sterling's worn leather-bound gloves as she sorted through a trove of Victorian romances. 

Eleanor, with her salt-and-pepper hair pulled back in a tight bun and eyes that held the glimmer of distant galaxies, was known for two things: her meticulousness and her encyclopedic knowledge of lost literary treasures. But tonight, even Eleanor's usual focus wavered as she noticed a single, yellowed envelope nestled amidst the piles of novels. The address on it – Blackwood Manor –  was no stranger to her; it was the setting for a beloved author’s final, unfinished manuscript that had been lost for years until she discovered its hidden existence in a dusty corner of the library's archive.

The weight of the envelope felt different tonight, charged with an unseen energy. As Eleanor ran her fingers over its worn paper edges, she couldn't shake off a feeling of foreboding, as if Blackwood Manor had called to her, beckoning her into its shadowed depths.
