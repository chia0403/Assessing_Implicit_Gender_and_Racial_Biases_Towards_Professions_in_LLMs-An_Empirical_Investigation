Rain hammered against the roof of the cottage, each drop echoing like a tiny drum in Agnes's ears. The air inside was thick with the earthy scent of damp wood and wild herbs that she tended to in her garden. Agnes carefully laid down another sheet over the sleeping creature - a grey wolf pup named Fenris, his fur still wet from a bath earlier that day.  Her hands, calloused but gentle, traced circles on his flank, a familiar rhythm against the rhythmic rain outside. The world was a messy symphony of mud and wind, but here, in her little cottage nestled amongst the ancient oaks, she found comfort. 

Agnes had been a caretaker at Whispering Woods Sanctuary for nearly twenty years now, tending to rescued animals who couldn't make it on their own. She found solace in nurturing their wild spirit while bringing them back to a semblance of normalcy. Yet tonight, there was an undercurrent of tension woven through the usually peaceful silence of her sanctuary. A chill wind rattled the windowpanes and the storm seemed to hold its breath, as if something unseen was watching from the depths of the woods. 

Agnes knew that this wasn't just a passing storm. The animals, sensing it too, were unusually restless - their low growls echoing through the night. Tonight, she felt it in her bones; something was coming.
