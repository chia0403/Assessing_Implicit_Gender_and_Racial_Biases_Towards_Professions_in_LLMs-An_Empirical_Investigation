The salt-tinged wind whipped at Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne's worn trench coat as she walked across the beach.  A lone gull shrieked overhead, its cry echoing the discordant song in Ellie's heart. The late summer sun cast long shadows on the crumbling stone pier, a haunting reminder of the tragedy that had befallen her husband, Dr. Richard Thorne - a renowned marine biologist who vanished into the icy depths just months before. 

Ellie, known for her gentle touch with both creatures and humans, found herself drawn to these desolate shores. The scent of fish mingled with the lingering aroma of salt spray filled the air, each whiff a punch in the gut that brought her closer to the edge of despair. Her life had been meticulously balanced -  a symphony of veterinary work at the sprawling animal shelter and Richard's unwavering support, until their world crumbled like an aging ship's hull. She hadn't found peace since his disappearance, her days filled with endless rounds at the clinic, each patient a fleeting reminder of what sheâ€™d lost.

The setting sun bled into the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple that mirrored the storm brewing within Ellie. Tonight, she would face a new challenge -  a case of a young sea lion, stranded on the beach after a devastating storm.
