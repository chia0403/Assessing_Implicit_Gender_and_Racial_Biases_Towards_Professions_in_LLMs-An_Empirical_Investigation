A symphony of water cascaded through gutters and sputtered from cracks in the foundation, mimicking the rhythm of Jake's growing headache. 

Jake "Rusty" O'Connell wasn't built for this life.

The house belonged to the infamous Blackwood family, whose legacy was built on a foundation of both grand achievements and scandalous whispers. And Jake, with his tools, was about to unearth the truth hidden beneath the peeling paint and warped floors.
