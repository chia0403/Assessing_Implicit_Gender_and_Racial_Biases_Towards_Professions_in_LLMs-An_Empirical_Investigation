Time measured by the gentle click of shears, the sigh of fabric against metal, and the soft patter of rain drumming on the roof. Elias was no stranger to the flurry of life that spilled onto his street from the bustling markets beyond; he simply preferred the comfort of creating within this small haven he'd built for himself, where threads whispered secrets and patterns danced in the light.
