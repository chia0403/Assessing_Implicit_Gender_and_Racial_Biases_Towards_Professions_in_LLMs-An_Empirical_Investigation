## Setting: The Neon Cathedral

**Location:** A gleamingly modern hospital wing in Seoul, South Korea - The "Neo-Temple" where cutting-edge medical technology meets traditional Korean healing philosophies. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Ji Hye Kwon, a renowned heart surgeon known for his calm demeanor and meticulous surgical technique. He's a man of logic, efficiency, and precise movements – his scalpel seemingly an extension of himself. 

## Story Opening:

The fluorescent hum of the Neo-Temple’s operating room reverberated through Dr. Ji Hye Kwon's bones. His sharp gaze was fixed on the monitor displaying a beating heart, its rhythmic thump the only sound that dared interrupt the clinical silence.  He felt a familiar pang in his chest – a sense of both profound responsibility and weary acceptance. 

It had been years since he’d held this patient's hand, decades since a younger Dr. Kwon first entered this hallowed ground. The boy with a hopeful gaze in his eyes, now a man standing before him was a living testament to the relentless march of time, of lives that were intertwined and forever changed by the delicate act of surgery. 

As he carefully adjusted the sterile drapes, he whispered a silent prayer – not for the patient's well-being alone, but for a deeper truth: for life, in all its complex beauty, to continue pulsating within these fragile vessels. It was a question that haunted him in the quiet moments between surgeries, as he navigated the ethical and moral labyrinths of healing. 

His journey into this world wasn't about ambition or fame. He sought to heal, not just through technology, but through an unwavering understanding of life itself - an understanding he was still striving to grasp.
