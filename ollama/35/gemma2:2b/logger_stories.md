The mist clung to the pines like a phantom embrace, swirling around Silas "Stonehand" Blackwood's boots as he climbed into his worn pickup truck.  He puffed on a long, ash-filled cigarette, watching the sun bleed out behind the jagged peaks of the Northern Rockies. The air was crisp, biting cold even with layers upon layers of flannel and leather. He squinted at the fading light, feeling a familiar ache in his shoulders - a constant reminder of years spent wrestling trees and hauling timber. 

His campsite, nestled in a forgotten corner of the ancient forest, hummed with the quiet symphony of nature. A crackling fire danced against the gathering darkness, casting flickering shadows on the weathered logs that housed him for months at a time. He was alone. His wife had left after years of watching his life bleed out into wood and bark, longing for something she could only find in the stories she read. 

Tonight, he wasn't just working to provide; he was working to forget.
