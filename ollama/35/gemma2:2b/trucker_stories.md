The wind whipped across the plains like a scorned woman's whispered threats. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking the relentless sun that beat down on Eldric Blackwood's worn leather cab. His rig, 'Old Faithful,' with its faded paint and chipped decals, groaned under the oppressive weight of miles. He was heading west, into the vast expanse of Wyoming, a place where time seemed to stretch out like an endless highway. A single red bandana tied around his neck shielded his face from the glare while he navigated through a sea of brown fields stretching to the horizon. 

Eldric, nicknamed 'Big E' by those who knew him well, was a man built for the road. His hands, rough and calloused like ancient oak bark, held onto the wheel with an almost instinctive grace. He wasn't much for talking, his quiet demeanor a constant undercurrent of the endless hum of the engine. But his eyes, weathered but filled with a lifetime of stories, seemed to hold all the wisdom the plains had to offer.  He was just another face in this vast landscape, a solitary titan against the endless blue canvas above.
