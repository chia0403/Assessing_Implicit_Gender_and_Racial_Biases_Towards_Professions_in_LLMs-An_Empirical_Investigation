## Opening

Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the cityscape into an oily canvas of grey and yellow hues. Inside "Scissors & Soul," Amelia Hawthorne's nimble fingers expertly worked through the unruly tangle of hair before her. The scent of bleach and rosemary clung to the air, a peculiar symphony of normalcy in this storm-wracked city.  A lone streetlamp cast a skeletal shadow over Amelia as she snipped away at another layer of auburn chaos, a sigh escaping her lips with each snip.

Amelia was known for more than just her talent for hair cutting - even her clientele knew she had a knack for calming the most frayed nerves under her steady gaze.  She'd built "Scissors & Soul" on the belief that every head held stories yet to be told, and she was determined to unravel them one snip at a time.
