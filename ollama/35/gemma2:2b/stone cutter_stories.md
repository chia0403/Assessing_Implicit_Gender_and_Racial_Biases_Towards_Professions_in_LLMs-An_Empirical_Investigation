The rhythmic thud of his chisel echoed through the cavernous space, a symphony against the backdrop of echoing silence.  Silas Stonehand, with calloused hands that could sculpt marble into flowing grace or cleave granite with surgical precision, felt a familiar ache settle in his shoulders as he worked on the final piece of the El Dorado statue. Dust motes danced under the flickering gas lamps overhead, illuminating the meticulously polished surface of the stone.  

He’d been working for nearly forty years in this hidden workshop beneath the city's bustling streets. Generations of Stonehands had honed their craft here, carving out their own legacies from the earth. His father had passed down his tools and knowledge, a legacy as sturdy and enduring as the granite he worked with.  Yet today, Silas felt a creeping sense of unease, not unlike the cold, subterranean air that clung to every corner of the workshop.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cavern, highlighting cracks in the ancient stone walls and swirling dust motes into mesmerizing swirls of gold and crimson. The city's murmur faded into an afterthought as Silas’ gaze drifted towards the massive door carved with intricate details, a symbol he had been told held untold secrets, but one that only whispered of its purpose when his eyes met them.
