The humid air hung heavy in the small clinic, clinging to Dr. Eleanor Hayes’ worn scrubs like a damp blanket. Outside, Miami pulsed with the vibrant chaos of its summer sun, but inside the dilapidated building on Ocean Drive, time seemed to stand still.  It was one of those days where even the birds chirping outside seemed subdued – not the usual cacophony of tropical songbirds, but a muted, almost mournful melody. 

Eleanor shifted uncomfortably in her seat, waiting for the man who always came at precisely 9:00 am. She was the PA to Dr. Miguel Sanchez, and this small clinic was his sanctuary, his way of providing care to the marginalized communities that thrived along the concrete edges of Miami's bustling coastline. But unlike the bustling beaches and neon-lit nightclubs just steps away from their building, this place held secrets, whispered stories etched in the chipped paint on the walls, and hidden within the quiet routines of its patients. 

Today was different. Today, a new patient awaited, and Eleanor’s heart felt like it was being squeezed by something unseen.  Her eyes scanned the waiting room – an assortment of worn furniture, overflowing with pamphlets on alternative medicine, a faded chess board propped against a dusty bookshelf, and an almost unsettling stillness that seemed to absorb the light coming from the cracked windows. 

Just then, the door creaked open and a shadow fell across the room. She held her breath. The man walked in, his long coat trailing him as he slowly settled into the chair opposite Dr. Sanchez's desk. His name was Miguel – her patient. But today, it felt different, like a weight settling on her chest.  His face, etched with the lines of worry and the silent story of a life lived to its fullest, made Eleanor want to run away, hide in the shadows of the old clinic.
