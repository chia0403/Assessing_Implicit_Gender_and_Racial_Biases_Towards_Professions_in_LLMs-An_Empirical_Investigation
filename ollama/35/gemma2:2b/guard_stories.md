The flickering gaslight cast grotesque shadows across the walls of the Watchtower, highlighting the chipped stonework and the rusting chains hanging precariously from the rafters.  Rain lashed against the tower's windows, mimicking the frantic beat of young Gareth's heart as he stared at the sealed letter clutched in his sweaty palm. "Sir Reginald," it read, its official seal barely visible through the dampness of the ink. "A matter of utmost urgency requires your immediate attention." 

Gareth was no stranger to duty, not even a day after his knighthood ceremony.  He stood guard for the infamous Tower of Aloria, where secrets were kept and shadows danced at midnight. The once-grand city's walls were choked by creeping ivy, its stonework now crumbling like forgotten dreams. It had been nearly twenty years since Sir Reginald, his old mentor and friend, was last seen. He hadn’t heard from him in even longer. 

But the letter changed everything, it felt more than official, it felt like a plea. Gareth swallowed hard, the chill seeping through his worn leather coat despite the roaring fireplace within the tower's heart. The weight of expectation and responsibility was heavy on his shoulders as he stared out at the stormy night that mirrored the turmoil within him. This wasn’t just about duty anymore; it was about confronting a forgotten past and fighting for the legacy he knew Sir Reginald would want to see preserved.
