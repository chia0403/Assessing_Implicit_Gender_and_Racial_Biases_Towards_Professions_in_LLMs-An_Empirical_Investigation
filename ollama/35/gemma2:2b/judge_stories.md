Rain hammered against the stained glass windows, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the opulent mahogany courtroom.  The air thrummed with anticipation; even the normally imposing oak door seemed to hold its breath as it creaked open, allowing in Judge Elias Thorne and his weary entourage of assistants.

He surveyed the room, taking in the hushed faces of witnesses, lawyers with their finely-dressed suits radiating tension, and the ever-present cloud of uncertainty hanging heavy in the air.

The young man stood apart from the others, his face obscured by a hooded cloak that seemed to absorb any light and cast him into an almost-invisible form. His name was Ethan Blackwood, accused of murder.
