The air in Mr. Alistair Thorne's office hummed with an unnerving quiet that was almost as stifling as the mahogany desk piled high with financial reports. Outside, New York City throbbed with its usual frenetic energy, but within these four walls, time seemed to have stopped. The only sound was the faint ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner, a relic from another era. Alistair stared at the ticker tape that fluttered like an agitated moth on his monitor, his usually sharp eyes dulled with fatigue. 

**Setting:** A high-rise office building in Manhattan.  The year is 2023. The office has floor-to-ceiling windows offering a breathtaking panoramic view of the city's skyline, reflecting both its dizzying ambition and Alistair's own internal turmoil.


**Character:** Alistair Thorne:  A successful stock broker who, despite his impressive portfolio, feels like he's lost his way. He struggles with an unyielding sense of unease and questions his place in a world that seems increasingly indifferent to personal connection.
