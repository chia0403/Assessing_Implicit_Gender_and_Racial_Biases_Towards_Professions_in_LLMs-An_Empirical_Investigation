The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Frank "Sparks" Sterling's workshop, each drop like a tiny hammer blow to his already weary mind. Outside, the wind howled through the rusted skeletal limbs of the abandoned factory, churning the sea-fog into swirling, mournful shapes. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of ozone and stale beer. Sparks, perched precariously on a rickety stool near the workbench, squinted at the blueprints spread across the table. His calloused hands, dusted in chalk and grease, traced the lines, his brow furrowed in concentration. 

This wasn't a typical day for Sparks. He wasn’t usually called upon for this kind of job – restoring an ancient lighthouse during a hurricane was not exactly on the "standard electrician" checklist.  But with every passing hour, the urgency in Mayor Thompson’s voice grew louder over the crackling radio static. The old light needed to be working by morning or the island would plunge into darkness, and that was where Sparks came in – a reluctant hero of the storm-battered coast. 


**Location:** An abandoned industrial factory on a remote island, battered by a fierce hurricane.
