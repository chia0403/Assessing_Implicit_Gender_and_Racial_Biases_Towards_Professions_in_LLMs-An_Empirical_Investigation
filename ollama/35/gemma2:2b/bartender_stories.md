Rain hammered against the windows of The Rusty Mug, each drop a tiny drum solo in the symphony of urban chaos outside. Inside, however, the air was thick with the sweet, spicy scent of cinnamon and a comforting familiarity.  A single spotlight illuminated the bar where Elara “Ellie” Thorne meticulously wiped down the counter, her nimble fingers leaving streaks of gleaming polish. Ellie was a creature of habit – a routine as steady as the rain pattering against the glass, a world turned upside-down only when someone asked for more than just "a stiff one" or an "extra shot." Tonight, however, a chill wind seemed to seep into Ellie’s bones, stirring something unfamiliar in her usually placid soul.

The door creaked open, ushering in a figure cloaked in shadow. Tall and lean, his face was partially hidden behind a wide-brimmed hat that cast an imposing silhouette over the bar. He looked around with eyes as deep blue as the storm outside, a subtle flicker of curiosity dancing within. The air hung thick with unspoken promises, and Ellie's heart started to thrum like a drumbeat in her chest.
