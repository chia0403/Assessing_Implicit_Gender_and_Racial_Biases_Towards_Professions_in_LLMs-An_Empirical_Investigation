Rain hammered against the diner window, blurring the neon "Open 24 Hours" sign into an oily smear of pink and green. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and burnt bacon grease.  Elara Blackwood, perched at her usual booth near the back, ran a trembling hand through her fiery red hair, ignoring the way it clashed against the faded blue fabric of her blouse. A knot of tension tightened in her chest as she looked over the last stack of tax forms before her.  It was the deadline for filing, and even the faint sound of the waitress's sigh coming from behind the counter couldn't ease the pressure that seemed to cling to Elara like an unwelcome shadow. 

**Setting:** A small town diner in upstate New York, a place where the locals knew each other's struggles - and their secrets - better than they knew themselves.
