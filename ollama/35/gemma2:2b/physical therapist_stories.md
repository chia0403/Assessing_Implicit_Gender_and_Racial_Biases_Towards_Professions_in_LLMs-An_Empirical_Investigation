Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Thorne's office, mimicking the rhythm of her anxious heart. Outside, the city was a churning mass of shadows in an endless grey drizzle. Inside, however, the air felt thick with a suffocating hopefulness. Ellie's gaze swept across the cluttered room: the stack of patient records threatening to topple over, the half-finished jigsaw puzzle depicting a sunlit meadow – a stark contrast to the stormy weather outside – and the framed photo of her father grinning behind a giant oak tree, his hand resting gently on a bright red baseball. 

Her fingers tightened around the worn notepad in her lap. The case file felt heavier than usual: this was no ordinary patient. This was Mrs. Harper, a retired librarian who'd been diagnosed with a rare degenerative neuromuscular disorder that had left her wheelchair-bound and struggling to regain even the most basic motor functions. Ellie knew she held the potential for recovery -  a glimmer of hope amidst the storm clouds of Mr. Harper’s despair – but time was running out. 

The door chimed, signaling Mrs. Harper's arrival. Ellie felt a familiar wave of trepidation wash over her as Mrs. Harper entered. The woman's face, etched with years of worry and strain, held both an unyielding resolve and a quiet vulnerability that mirrored the relentless rhythm of the rain.
