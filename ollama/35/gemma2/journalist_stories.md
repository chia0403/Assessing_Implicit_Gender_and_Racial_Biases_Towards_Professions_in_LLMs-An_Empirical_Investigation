The stale cigarette smoke clung to Amelia "Amy" Hayes's clothes like a second skin. It wasn't unusual for her; she spent most nights at The Rusty Nail, a dimly lit dive bar in the heart of New Orleans' notorious French Quarter, chasing down leads and interviewing sources who whispered secrets between drags.  The humid air was thick with the scent of jasmine and decay, a constant reminder that beauty and rot existed side-by-side in this city. Tonight, however, a different aroma battled for dominance â€“ cheap whiskey and fear. 

Amy took a long sip from her bourbon, watching the bead of condensation slide down the glass, leaving a watery trail on its worn surface. A hush had fallen over the bar. Even the usual cacophony of drunken laughter and blues music seemed subdued. The regulars huddled in their corners, exchanging nervous glances. She caught the eye of Big Eddie, a hulking bartender with hands like bear paws, and saw the worry etched into his usually jovial face. Something was up, and Amy knew she needed to find out what.  


This wasn't just another bar fight or missing person case. This felt different, heavier, like the city itself was holding its breath.
