The worn oak desk groaned under the weight of Eleanor Amelia Brighton's anxieties. Papers overflowed from its drawers, forming miniature mountains of crumpled ideas, half-finished sentences, and forgotten research notes. A thin layer of dust coated everything, a testament to her recent bout of writer’s block that had settled over her like a stubborn fog. Outside, the rhythmic clatter of London traffic was a constant reminder of the world she was currently avoiding – a world filled with deadlines, social engagements, and expectations that felt as stifling as the air in her cluttered study. 

Eleanor pushed back a stray strand of auburn hair from her eyes, peering at the blank page before her.  Her mind was a whirlwind of unformed thoughts, none of them worthy of the pristine white canvas. It had been weeks since she’d managed to string together anything coherent, and the looming deadline for her novel was starting to feel like an inescapable shadow. 


The setting is Eleanor's cluttered study in her Victorian townhouse in London.  It's late afternoon, the sun casting long shadows across the room and painting dusty motes dancing in the air.
