The red dust swirled around Amelia "Ace" Petrova's boots as she surveyed the barren landscape. The twin suns beat down on the ochre plains, baking the already parched earth until it cracked like brittle bone. A thin veil of haze obscured the horizon, painting the world in a hazy, ochre glow. This wasn't Earth. This was Kepler-186f, a planet light years away, colonized just two decades ago by pioneers desperate for a new home. 

Ace ran a gloved hand over the weathered metal hull of her ship, the Phoenix. It was patched and scarred from countless runs across this unforgiving terrain, each dent a testament to its resilience â€“ just like its pilot. Her hazel eyes, normally bright with mischievous glint, were narrowed in concentration as she adjusted the preflight settings on her wrist console. Today's mission was critical: delivering vital supplies to a remote outpost struggling against a devastating dust storm. 

The radio crackled to life. "Ace, this is Base Command. Weather conditions are deteriorating rapidly. Stand by for updated coordinates."


Her heart tightened. This wasn't the welcome she had hoped for.
