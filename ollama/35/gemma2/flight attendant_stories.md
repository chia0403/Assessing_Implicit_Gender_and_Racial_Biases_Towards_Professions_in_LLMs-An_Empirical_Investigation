The roar of the engines vibrated through Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's teeth as she finished her pre-flight safety demonstration.  Her smile, plastered on for the benefit of the passengers in Economy Class, felt brittle against the churning anxiety in her stomach. This wasn't just any flight; this was Flight 378 to Reykjavik, a route notorious for turbulence, and Amelia had a secret gnawing at her like a persistent parasite.

The setting sun cast an ethereal glow on Iceland's volcanic landscape through the panoramic windows of the Boeing 747. A tapestry of crimson and purple stretched across the sky, mirroring the fiery hues swirling within Amelia's chest. It was breathtaking, but she couldn't find herself appreciating it. Her mind was occupied with a single, ominous thought: what if the rumors were true? What if Flight 378 wasn't just prone to turbulence, but something far more sinister?
