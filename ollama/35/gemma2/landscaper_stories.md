The sun beat down on Amelia Thistlewoodâ€™s neck like a blacksmith's hammer, sweat beading on her brow and stinging her eyes. She squinted at the overgrown mess before her, a tangled jungle of weeds and neglected shrubs choking out what little remained of Mrs. Hemlock's once-proud rose garden in Maple Creek, Oregon. Amelia sighed, wiping her forehead with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of grime across her already dusty cheek. 

This wasn't the kind of restoration project she usually tackled. Her business, "Thistlewood Gardens," specialized in delicate perennial beds and whimsical water features, not battling invasive ivy and pulling out gnarled, century-old rose bushes. But Mrs. Hemlock, a fragile woman with eyes like faded sapphires, had begged Amelia to save her garden.  "It's the last piece of my husband left," she'd whispered, clutching Amelia's hand, "I can't bear to see it die."

Amelia couldn't refuse. 


So here she was, armed with a pair of heavy-duty shears and a trowel, surrounded by buzzing bees and the mournful chirping of cicadas, ready to embark on her most challenging landscaping project yet.
