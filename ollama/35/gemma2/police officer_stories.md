The neon glow of the "All-Nite Diner" sign pulsed like a dying heartbeat against the slick asphalt, reflecting off Detective Elias Blackwood's rain-streaked trench coat. Rain hammered on his fedora, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest. A steady stream of cars splashed through puddles, their headlights cutting through the thick fog that clung to downtown Asheville like a shroud. 

Elias stared at the diner's window, watching the figures move inside, blurred and indistinct in the warm yellow light. He should have been inside, warming himself with coffee and greasy food, but a call had pulled him away from his shift just as he'd settled into the familiar rhythm of late-night patrols. 


This was the kind of night that made Elias question why he'd ever joined the force. The damp cold seeped through his bones, the city felt alive with a hidden menace, and the weight of another unsolved case pressed heavy on his shoulders.  He tugged his coat tighter, steeling himself for whatever awaited him in the darkness beyond the diner's flickering light.
