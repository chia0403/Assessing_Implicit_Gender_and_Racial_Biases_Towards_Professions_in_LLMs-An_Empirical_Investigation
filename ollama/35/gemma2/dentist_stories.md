The midday sun beat down on Dr. Alistair Finch's gleaming white office building, turning the glass facade into a shimmering mirage. Inside, the air conditioning hummed a soothing counterpoint to the distant whir of traffic on bustling Elm Street. Alistair himself was anything but serene. He sat hunched over his desk, peering at a set of x-rays with furrowed brows. 

His usually impeccable white coat was rumpled, and dark circles shadowed his eyes. The image before him wasn't what he expected to see in Ms. Peterson's otherwise healthy mouth - a cluster of cavities nestled deep within the molars, appearing like tiny black moons against the pale bone. It was unusual, even for someone with a predilection for sugary treats like Ms. Peterson, and Alistair felt a prickle of unease. This wasn't just another routine filling; there was something more here, something that gnawed at his professional intuition. 


The chime announcing a new patient broke through his thoughts. Alistair sighed, pushing the x-rays aside. He plastered on his usual practiced smile, ready to face whatever dental dilemma awaited him next.  He hoped it wouldn't be anything like Ms. Peterson's enigmatic case.
