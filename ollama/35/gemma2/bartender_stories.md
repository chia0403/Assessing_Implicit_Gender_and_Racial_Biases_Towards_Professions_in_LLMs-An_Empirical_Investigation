Neon signs cast a sickly green glow across the cracked linoleum floor of The Rusty Tap, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale cigarette smoke.  Behind the bar, Amelia "Amy" Rose tapped her nails impatiently against the chipped Formica counter, her gaze flitting between the empty stools and the worn clock ticking away the late Tuesday night. It was one of those nights where even the regulars seemed lost in their own silent dramas, nursing drinks that tasted like regret. Amy sighed, her reflection wavering in the dusty mirror behind her.  This wasn't exactly how she envisioned her life, but it wasn't a complete disaster either. At least not yet. 


The Rusty Tap was on the outskirts of Harmony Ridge, a town where the biggest excitement usually involved who won the county fair pie contest. Amy dreamed of bigger things, of bustling bars in vibrant cities, of serving cocktails with names as exotic as their ingredients. But for now, Harmony Ridge was all she had. And maybe, just maybe, tonight would be different.
