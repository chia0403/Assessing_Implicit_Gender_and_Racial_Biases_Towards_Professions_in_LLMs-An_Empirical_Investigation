The greasy scent of motor oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of burnt coffee that permeated Benny "Grease Monkey" McAlister's workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the cluttered space: tools draped haphazardly over workbenches, tires stacked high against the walls, and a symphony of clanks, grinds, and the occasional hiss of escaping steam.  Benny, a burly man with arms thicker than most people's thighs, was hunched over a sputtering 1967 Ford Mustang, his brow furrowed in concentration as he wrestled with the carburetor.

His calloused fingers danced across the metal, a practiced ballet honed by years spent coaxing life back into forgotten machines. He muttered under his breath, half-curse, half-encouragement to the stubborn engine. The air crackled with the anticipation of success - or perhaps impending failure.  Either way, Benny McAlister was ready for it, as he always was. 


Benny's small garage, nestled on a forgotten side street in a decaying town called Rustbelt, was his sanctuary. It was where he felt truly alive, surrounded by the rhythmic symphony of engine roars and the satisfying clang of wrenches against metal. Outside, the world was filled with worries, anxieties, and an endless parade of disappointments. But within the greasy confines of his workshop, Benny found solace - a haven where he could fix not just machines, but broken spirits too.
