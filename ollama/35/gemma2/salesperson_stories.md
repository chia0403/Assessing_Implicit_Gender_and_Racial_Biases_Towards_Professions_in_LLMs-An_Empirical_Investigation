The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and freshly cut grass. Amelia "Amy" Hayes wiped the sweat from her brow, smoothing down the starched collar of her emerald green blouse. Her platform heels clicked on the cracked asphalt as she approached the sprawling, red-brick house. The lawn was meticulously manicured, a patchwork of vibrant clover and perfectly pruned bushes. This wasn't just another "average Joe" she was trying to sell solar panels to.  This was the McCallister estate – the crown jewel of Magnolia Creek and owned by Mrs. Eleanor McCallister, a woman known for her discerning taste and even more discerning wallet. 

Amy took a deep breath, adjusting the strap of her leather bag. Inside lay brochures, sample panels, and a meticulously crafted sales pitch – all tailored to Mrs. McCallister's desire for sustainability and luxury. Today was make or break; if she could secure this deal, it would be the biggest win of her young career at Solar Solutions, Inc. But with a client like Mrs. McCallister, Amy knew it wouldn't be easy.
