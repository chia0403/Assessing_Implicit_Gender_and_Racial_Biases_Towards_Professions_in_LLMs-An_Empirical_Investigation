The air in Bartholomew "Barty" Grimshaw's butcher shop hung thick with the scent of iron and brine. Not the metallic tang you might find after a storm, but the rich, earthy aroma of blood and meat left to cure overnight. Dawn was just breaking over the cobblestone streets of Alderbrook, casting long shadows across Barty’s weathered counter piled high with slabs of cured ham, glistening sausages, and plump cuts of beef. 

Barty himself stood at the back, his apron stained with the map of a butcher's life – splatters of crimson and brown like constellations on worn canvas. He was a man forged in the fires of Alderbrook’s relentless winters, his hands calloused, his face etched with the lines of a hundred cuts and even more stories. He hummed a tuneless melody as he sharpened his cleaver, the rhythmic clang against the whetstone punctuating the quiet morning air. 


Alderbrook was a town that lived and breathed off the land. Farmers brought their animals to Barty every week, their faces etched with the same resilience that marked his own. The butcher shop was more than just a business; it was the heart of the community, a place where gossip flowed like the ale at the local pub, and Barty held court as its king.  But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Barty’s spine, a premonition that the usual rhythm of Alderbrook was about to be shattered.
