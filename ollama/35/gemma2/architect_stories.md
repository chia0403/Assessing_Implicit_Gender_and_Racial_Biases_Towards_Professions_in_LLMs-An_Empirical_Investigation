The scent of fresh-baked bread drifted through the open window, mingling with the dust motes dancing in the late afternoon sun. Amelia Claire Beaumont squinted at the blueprints spread across her drafting table, the lines blurring against the golden light filtering through the tall panes of glass that looked out onto the bustling city below. Her Parisian apartment was perched on the fourth floor of an old Haussmannian building, a symphony of worn wood floors, chipped plaster walls, and faded velvet curtains. The constant hum of the city was a familiar lullaby, punctuated by the occasional honking taxi or the melodic chatter emanating from a café downstairs. 

Amelia ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, frustration tugging at her brow.  The project – a modern art museum perched precariously on the edge of the Seine – was proving to be more complex than she anticipated. The city council had issued another set of demands, each one pushing further against the boundaries of what she envisioned. Amelia sighed, leaning back in her chair and staring out at the cityscape unfolding before her. 

She wasn’t sure if she could keep fighting this battle.
