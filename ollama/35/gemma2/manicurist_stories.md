The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and almond polish as Esme Juniper carefully pressed her tools into the velvet-lined tray. It was always the same ritual before every client – a ballet of preparation, each movement honed over years spent crafting beauty on chipped nails and tired fingertips. Her tiny salon, "Esmeralda's Elixirs", nestled on a cobblestone street in Prague’s Old Town, pulsed with a quiet hum. The afternoon sun slanted through the lace curtains, casting playful shadows on the worn wooden floorboards. A stray ray illuminated a dust mote swirling like a miniature galaxy, before settling onto the chipped enamel of a vintage French manicure set – Esme's favorite piece. 

The bell above the door tinkled, announcing her next appointment. A woman with eyes as bright and sharp as amethyst stones entered, leaving behind the scent of rain and something else, something wilder, something that prickled at the back of Esme's neck. This wasn't just another manicure.
