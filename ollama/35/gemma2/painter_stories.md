The air in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's studio was thick with the scent of linseed oil and damp canvas.  Sunlight streamed through the single skylight, casting long shadows across the chaotic expanse of her workspace. Tubes of paint, squeezed like colorful toothpaste, lined the edges of the battered table. Brushes of every size lay scattered amongst stacks of canvases, some bare and expectant, others bursting with vibrant hues that hinted at half-formed ideas.  

Amelia, a woman whose fiery red hair mirrored the smoldering passion in her eyes, stood before a nearly finished canvas. She squinted, stepping back to assess her work. The scene depicted a bustling Parisian street, captured in a whirlwind of brushstrokes that gave life to the cobblestones, the laughter spilling from cafes, and the vibrant tapestry of humanity weaving through it all. But something was missing. A spark.  A story waiting to be told.


This wasn't just another painting for Amelia. This was her ticket out of this cramped studio, out of this city that felt increasingly like a cage. It was a chance to prove herself, to finally break free from the shadow of her famous grandmother, the celebrated portrait artist who had set the bar impossibly high.
