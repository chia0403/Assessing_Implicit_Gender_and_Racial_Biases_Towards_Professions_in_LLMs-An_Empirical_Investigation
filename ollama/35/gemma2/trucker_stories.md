The diesel engine hummed like a contented beast beneath Daniel "Deacon" Blackwood's calloused fingers. Outside his window, the Oklahoma plains stretched out, a sea of amber waves rippling under the relentless summer sun. A lone hawk circled overhead, its silhouette stark against the endless blue canvas. Deacon squinted at the horizon, the sweat beading on his forehead stinging his eyes.  He was four days into a haul from Dallas to Denver, and the monotony was starting to gnaw at him. The air inside the cab felt thick with the scent of stale coffee and dust, but it was the silence that bothered him most. He craved the rumble of conversation, the laughter shared over greasy diner food, the camaraderie of other truckers - anything but the endless solitude of the open road. 


Deacon gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles turning white.  He needed a break, something to shake him out of this rut. Maybe he'd pull into that little town up ahead, grab a burger and see what kind of trouble – or maybe just conversation - he could find. He knew, deep down, that this trip was more than just delivering cargo; it was a journey inward, a search for something he couldn’t quite name.
