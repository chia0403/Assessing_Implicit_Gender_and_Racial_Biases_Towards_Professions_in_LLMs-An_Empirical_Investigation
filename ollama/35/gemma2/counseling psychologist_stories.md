The flickering neon sign outside Dr. Eleanor Vance's office cast an eerie green glow across the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, Eleanor sat behind her desk, its polished surface reflecting her tired eyes. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and the lingering aroma of lavender hand sanitizer, a futile attempt to mask the underlying mustiness of the old building.  

The city outside hummed with a frenetic energy she couldn't quite decipher. A constant backdrop of sirens and distant laughter mingled with the rhythmic patter of rain against the windowpanes. But inside her small office, nestled in a forgotten corner of downtown Seattle, time seemed to move differently. Each tick of the antique clock on the wall felt heavy, pregnant with the weight of unspoken anxieties and hidden pain. 

Eleanor ran a hand through her short, auburn hair, trying to banish the growing sense of unease that had settled over her like a shroud. Tonight was different. She could feel it in her bones. The usual anxious hum of anticipation before each session was amplified, replaced by a sharp, almost electric tension. 


And then, the bell above the door jingled, signaling the arrival of her next patient â€“ and potentially, something far more complex than she'd ever encountered before.
