The air in Anya Petrova's apartment hummed with the low thrum of her gaming rig. Outside, Moscow was cloaked in the oppressive grey of a late autumn evening, the streetlights casting long, skeletal shadows across the slick pavement. Inside, however, it was a different world – a vibrant, pixelated landscape filled with fantastical creatures and impossible landscapes. Anya, bathed in the ethereal glow of her monitor, expertly maneuvered her avatar through a treacherous dungeon, her fingers flying across the keyboard.

Anya wasn't just playing; she was coding. She was one of the top programmers at "Codex," a cutting-edge AI development firm, and this virtual world wasn't just entertainment – it was her testing ground. She poured countless hours into tweaking algorithms, crafting intricate puzzles, and building immersive experiences within the game engine.  

But tonight, something felt different. A strange glitch flickered across the screen, momentarily distorting the familiar landscape. Anya frowned, instinctively reaching for the keyboard to fix it. But before she could intervene, the world around her dissolved into a blinding white light.
