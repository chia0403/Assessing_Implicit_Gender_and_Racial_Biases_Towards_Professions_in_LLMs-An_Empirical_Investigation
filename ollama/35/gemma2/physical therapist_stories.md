The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and lavender oil in Amelia "Amy" Harper's office. Sunlight streamed through the floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking a bustling city street below, casting warm squares on the faded Persian rug that lay before her desk. A gentle jazz melody played softly from a speaker tucked away in the corner, providing a calming counterpoint to the clinking of metal weights and the muffled grunts of patients working out in the adjacent gym. 

Amy sat at her desk, reviewing Mr. Evans' medical chart with furrowed brows. The man had been referred for chronic back pain stemming from years spent hunched over a keyboard as a graphic designer. Amy knew the drill: assess his range of motion, strength, and gait; develop a personalized treatment plan; guide him through exercises and stretches designed to relieve his pain and restore his mobility. 

But something in Mr. Evans' case felt different. There was a tightness in his shoulders that went beyond muscle strain, a tremor in his hand she couldn't quite place. And then there were the bruises, faint and scattered across his arms and legs, like the aftermath of a struggle he didn't want to talk about. 


Amy closed the file, her mind buzzing with questions. This was more than just a routine physiotherapy appointment. This was a puzzle she had to solve.
