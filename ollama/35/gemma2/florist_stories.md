The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, a cloying sweetness that both comforted and suffocated Eloise Clementine Bellweather. It was always like this at the beginning of summer - the floral shop, "Bloom & Breathe," felt less like a sanctuary and more like a greenhouse on overdrive. 

Eloise, her fingers stained purple from hydrangeas, wiped a stray bead of sweat from her brow. Outside, the midday sun blazed down on Maple Street, casting long shadows that danced across the sidewalk in front of her shop. Tourists flocked to the charming downtown area, snapping pictures of the quaint storefronts and indulging in overpriced ice cream cones. But Eloise barely noticed them. Her focus was locked on the unruly bouquet she was attempting to tame - a riotous mix of roses, sunflowers, and baby's breath that screamed "amateur hour."  

The bell above the door tinkled, announcing a new customer. Eloise took a deep breath, willing herself to smile.  Maybe this one would buy something, anything, to help offset the cost of the exorbitant rent increase she was facing next month.
