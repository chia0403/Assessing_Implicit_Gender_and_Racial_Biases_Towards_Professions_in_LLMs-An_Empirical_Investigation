Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vanceâ€™s office, mirroring the tempest brewing within her own mind. The small, book-lined space, usually a sanctuary of calm amidst the chaos of her patients' lives, felt claustrophobic tonight. Outside, the city lights blurred into an anemic glow beneath the storm clouds, casting long, distorted shadows across the worn Persian rug. 

Eleanor had always found solace in routine, in the structured predictability of her work. But tonight, a gnawing unease was chipping away at her carefully constructed facade. The case files stacked on her desk seemed to pulse with an unsettling energy, each one whispering secrets she couldn't decipher. And then there was the dream - the recurring dream that had haunted her for weeks, a chilling premonition of something terrible yet to come. 


Eleanor glanced at the clock: 8:52 pm. She needed to close up, to escape the suffocating atmosphere and find some semblance of peace in the quiet solitude of her apartment. But something held her back, an invisible tether keeping her tethered to this office, to the storm raging both inside and out.
