The scent of jasmine tea and old leather clung to the air in Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne's workshop. Sunlight streamed through the dusty skylight above, illuminating motes of dust dancing around a half-finished design for a Victorian townhouse renovation. Outside, the cobbled streets of Bath hummed with the usual Saturday morning bustle, but inside Eleanorâ€™s sanctuary, time seemed to move at its own languid pace.

She tapped her charcoal pencil against the rendering, frowning at the placement of the antique fireplace in the drawing room.  It felt off, somehow, like a misplaced comma in a perfectly crafted sentence. Eleanor prided herself on an innate sense of balance and harmony, finding beauty in the subtle interplay of textures, colours, and historical details. A space, she believed, should breathe with personality, whispering stories of its inhabitants past and present. This townhouse, with its intricate plasterwork and faded grandeur, begged to be revitalized, to reclaim its lost elegance. But Eleanor knew that achieving true harmony required more than just aesthetic choices. It demanded an understanding of the soul behind the walls, a connection she hadn't yet made with this house or its prospective owners.
