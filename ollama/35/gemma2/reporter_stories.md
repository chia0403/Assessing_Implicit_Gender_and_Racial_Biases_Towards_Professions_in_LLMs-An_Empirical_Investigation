The humid Atlanta air hung heavy, thick with the smell of honeysuckle and impending rain. A swarm of cicadas buzzed in the overgrown ivy clinging to the brick facade of the courthouse, their chorus a rhythmic counterpoint to the clanging of Amelia Grace Thornton's typewriter keys.

The words felt hollow, lacking the grit and urgency that defined Amelia's best work. She needed more than speculation and whispers; she needed answers. But so far, every lead had gone cold, every interview a dead end.  Amelia sighed, pushing back her unruly auburn hair from her face. This case was proving to be more challenging than she'd anticipated, and the clock was ticking.
