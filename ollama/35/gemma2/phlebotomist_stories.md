The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Roseblood, casting a sterile sheen over the tiny vials lined up on her tray.  She could smell antiseptic, faint traces of lavender hand sanitizer, and something else - a metallic tang that always clung to the air in her domain: Room 3B at Mercy General Hospital. Amy loved it. The rhythmic buzz of the machines, the hushed whispers of anxious patients, the gentle clink of needles against glass â€“ it was a symphony of medical precision she knew better than any opera.  

Today's patient, however, wasn't humming along to the familiar tune. Mrs. Peterson, her forehead creased with worry, clutched a rosary in her trembling hands. Amy knelt beside her, placing a reassuring hand on the frail arm. "Mrs. Peterson," she said, her voice as calm and steady as ever, "Just take a deep breath, and we'll get this over with quickly."

But something felt off. The usual calm had been replaced by an unsettling tension in the room. The air crackled, not with static electricity, but with a subtle energy that sent a shiver down Amy's spine. She couldn't quite place it, but she knew, deep down, that this wasn't going to be just another routine blood draw.
