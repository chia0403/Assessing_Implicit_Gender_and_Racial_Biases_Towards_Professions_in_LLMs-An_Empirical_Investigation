The air hung thick with the scent of bay rum and talc in "Frank's Fine Fades," a barbershop tucked away on a sleepy side street in Bayonne, New Jersey. Outside, the late summer sun beat down on cracked asphalt, making the day feel heavier than usual. Inside, Frank Delacroix hummed along to the rhythmic whirring of his clippers, his skilled hands working magic on Mr. Esposito's unruly gray hair. 

Frank wasn’t just a barber; he was a confidant, a therapist, and sometimes even a reluctant advisor to the men who sat in his worn leather chairs. He knew their stories, their worries, their dreams, all gleaned from years of listening while they ran their fingers through their newly trimmed beards or admired themselves in the dusty mirror. 


Today, however, something felt different. A strange tension buzzed beneath the usual chatter and clink of shears. Frank couldn’t place it, but a knot of unease tightened in his stomach as he watched Mr. Esposito leave, his face uncharacteristically grim. He glanced at the clock – almost noon. Time for his lunch break. But before he could even reach for his well-worn fedora, the bell above the door chimed, ushering in a figure Frank hadn’t seen in years.
