Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Alistair Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of "Finch Investigations" into an indecipherable smear. The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock that seemed to mock the stillness of the night. 

Alistair, his trench coat dripping with rainwater and his fedora casting a shadow over weary eyes, stared out at the desolate cityscape. He hadn't had a decent case in weeks, just a string of petty thefts and missing cat reports – hardly the stuff of noir legend he'd always dreamt of. But tonight, something was different. The insistent ringing of his phone snapped him back to reality. 

"Finch Investigations," Alistair rasped into the receiver, his voice rough from days of stale coffee and unfulfilled ambition. "Yes?"


The caller identified herself as Mrs. Elara Davenport, her voice trembling with a mixture of fear and desperation. She needed Alistair's help, she said, to find something… someone… that had been taken from her under the cover of night. And she was willing to pay handsomely for his expertise. 

Alistair felt a flicker of excitement ignite within him. This could be it. The case he'd been waiting for, the one that would finally pull him out of this rut and plunge him into the heart of the city's underbelly. He straightened his tie, adjusted his fedora, and replied, "Mrs. Davenport, I'm on my way."
