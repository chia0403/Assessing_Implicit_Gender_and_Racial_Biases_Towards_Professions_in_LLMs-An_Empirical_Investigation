The stench hit Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins before he even rounded the corner onto Elm Street. It was the unmistakable aroma of rotten eggs, mingled with a metallic tang that spoke of rusted pipes and ancient plumbing nightmares. Bart, veteran of countless bathroom battles and sewer skirmishes, knew this smell all too well: it meant another day in his life as Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, the plumber.

His beat-up Ford truck rumbled to a stop in front of a dilapidated Victorian house, its gingerbread trim peeling like sunburn and paintwork faded to a sickly shade of green. A handwritten sign taped to the door read, “Help! Leaking Sink, Overflowing Toilet!” Bart sighed. Classic case of neglect. This wasn't his first rodeo, though, and he was armed with his trusty wrench, plunger, and a can-do attitude that could rival a honey badger on a sugar rush. 


He grabbed his toolkit from the truck bed and approached the house, prepared to face whatever plumbing horrors awaited him inside.
