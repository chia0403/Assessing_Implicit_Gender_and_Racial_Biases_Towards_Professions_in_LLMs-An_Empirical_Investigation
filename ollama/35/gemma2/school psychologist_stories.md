The stale smell of disinfectant and unfulfilled lunches clung to the air in Ms. Evelyn Thistlewick’s office. Sunlight, filtered through the grime on the windowpane, cast dust motes dancing in a lazy waltz. Outside, the cacophony of Northwood Elementary – children's laughter, slamming lockers, and the drone of distant announcements – was a muffled symphony. 

Ms. Thistlewick, her auburn hair pulled back tight in a bun, tapped absentmindedly on her desk blotter, its faded floral pattern barely visible beneath years of accumulated pen marks and spilled coffee. Today was Monday, which meant another week of navigating the emotional minefield that was elementary school. And today, she had a particularly troubling case: eight-year-old Samuel Jenkins, who claimed his pencil drawings were coming to life.
