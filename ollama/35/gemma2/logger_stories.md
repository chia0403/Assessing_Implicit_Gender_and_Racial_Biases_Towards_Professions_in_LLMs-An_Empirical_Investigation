The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, the only sounds the crunch of boots on frost-covered ground and the rhythmic chirp of unseen sparrows. A thin veil of mist clung to the valley floor, swallowing the distant peaks in a hazy shroud. The first rays of dawn were just beginning to pierce through the canopy, casting long, skeletal shadows from the towering Douglas firs that lined Elias Blackwood's path.

Elias, his face weathered and tanned by years under the open sky, paused at the edge of the clearing. His calloused hands tightened around the worn handle of his axe, the steel gleaming faintly in the weak light. He squinted towards the north, where a massive fir tree stood sentinel, its crown barely visible through the swirling mist. This was the one. The heartwood giant, whispered about by seasoned loggers and rumored to be centuries old. It was Elias's quarry today, his challenge for this crisp autumn morning.
