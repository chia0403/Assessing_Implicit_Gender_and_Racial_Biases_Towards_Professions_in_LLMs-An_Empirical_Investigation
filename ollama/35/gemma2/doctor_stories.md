The pungent scent of antiseptic mingled with the metallic tang of blood in Dr. Eleanor Vance’s nostrils.  She stood at the head of the operating theatre, her reflection wavering in the cool, sterile surface of the stainless steel table. The rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor was a steady metronome in the hushed silence, punctuated by the occasional clipped commands from Nurse Davies and the hiss of pressurized air as instruments were passed between them.  

Eleanor’s focus was laser-sharp on the pale canvas stretched out before her: the open chest cavity of a young man, his lifeblood a scarlet tide flowing into a waiting basin. He lay unconscious, his youth starkly juxtaposed against the harsh reality of the trauma that had brought him here. A mangled limb, a fractured ribcage, and a bullet lodged deep within his lung - each wound a silent testament to the chaotic world beyond the operating theatre walls.  

The city of New Alexandria was a cauldron of simmering tension. Gang warfare raged in the shadows, and violence spilled onto the streets with sickening regularity. Eleanor knew that this young man’s story was just one among many, another casualty in a war fought not on battlefields but within the concrete canyons of their urban sprawl.  

Tonight, her battlefield was here, in the sterile confines of this operating theatre. Tonight, she was his only hope.
