The aroma of burnt sugar and cardamom hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the sterile white walls and gleaming stainless steel of Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's consulting room. She inhaled deeply, trying to separate the comforting scent of her grandmother's chai from the bitter tang of the man before her -  Mr. Henry Worthington, CEO of Worthington Pharmaceuticals and notorious for his penchant for late-night donut runs. Ellie pushed a notepad towards him, its pages blank except for a single question scrawled across the top: "What are your dietary habits?" 

Ellie's office was tucked away on the second floor of a bustling medical complex in downtown Chicago, a world away from the sprawling mansions and private jets Mr. Worthington inhabited. Sunlight streamed through the large bay window, illuminating the rows of colorful healthy snacks lining one wall, and the framed posters showcasing nutritional guidelines.  It was Ellie's sanctuary, a space where she could help people understand their bodies and make informed choices about their well-being. 


But with a client like Mr. Worthington, whose company profited from fast-acting, often addictive medications rather than holistic health solutions, Ellie knew this wouldn't be an ordinary consultation. His gaze flickered nervously between the notepad and his reflection in the window, revealing a man on edge, desperately clinging to the image of success he'd carefully crafted. This wasn't just about donuts, Ellie sensed - it was about control, power, and the very foundation of Mr. Worthington's empire.
