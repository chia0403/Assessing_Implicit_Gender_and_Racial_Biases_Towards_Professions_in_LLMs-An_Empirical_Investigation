The Grand Magnolia Hotel reeked of old money and desperation, a heady perfume that clung to Theodore Alistair Bellweather like a second skin.  Theodore, or Ted as most folks called him, had been hauling luggage and delivering forgotten slippers up the winding staircases of the decaying grandeur for longer than he cared to remember.

The year was 1938, and the Great Depression had taken its toll on even the grandest establishments. The once bustling halls were now echoing with the quiet footsteps of dwindling guests – weary travelers clinging to fading dreams and wealthy widows trying desperately to hold onto their last shred of dignity.  Ted knew them all by name, by habit, by the way they held their heads a little lower each day. 

He leaned against the mahogany counter in the lobby, wiping down his already spotless uniform with a tired sigh. Outside, the rain lashed against the ornate windows, mimicking the ceaseless churn of Ted's own thoughts. He longed for something more than this life – a world beyond the sticky floors and faded wallpaper, where hope hadn't been so thoroughly extinguished. A world where perhaps, just perhaps, he could be someone other than just another cog in the broken machine of the Grand Magnolia Hotel.
