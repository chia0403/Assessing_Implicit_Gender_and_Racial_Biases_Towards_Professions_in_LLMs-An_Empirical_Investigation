The salty air whipped Elara Thistlewood's hair across her face as she squinted out at the choppy Atlantic. The cries of gulls mingled with the rumble of the approaching storm, sending shivers down her spine despite the thick wool coat pulled tight against the chill. Dawn was barely breaking, casting an ethereal glow over the ramshackle buildings that huddled together like frightened sheep on the edge of the craggy cliffs. This was Seahaven Sanctuary, a haven for injured and abandoned marine animals – Elara's world, her purpose. 

Seahaven wasn't your typical seaside tourist trap. There were no souvenir shops or brightly painted cafes here. Instead, it was a collection of repurposed fishing sheds and weathered barns, home to rescued seals, recovering dolphins, and even the occasional stranded whale calf. The scent of salt, fish, and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the delicate balance Elara strived to maintain between care and survival. 


Today promised to be particularly challenging. A fierce storm was brewing, threatening to unleash its fury on the already battered coast. And nestled amongst her usual charges – a grumpy harbor seal named Finnigan and a young dolphin pup nicknamed "Whisper" – lay a new arrival: a majestic grey whale calf, tangled in fishing nets and clinging to life. Elara knew she had to act fast. This storm wasn't just about battling the elements; it was about fighting for another soul's chance at survival.
