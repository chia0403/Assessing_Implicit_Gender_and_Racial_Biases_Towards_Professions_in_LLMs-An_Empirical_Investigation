The smell of sawdust hung heavy in the air, thick and comforting like a familiar blanket. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Elias Thornewood’s workshop, illuminating motes dancing in its golden rays. Outside, the bustling town of Oakhaven hummed with activity, but inside this sanctuary, time seemed to move at a different pace. 

Elias, his hands calloused and strong from years of working with wood, carefully measured a length of mahogany, his brow furrowed in concentration. He was crafting a cradle, a commission for the baker’s wife expecting her first child. Each curve and joint had to be perfect, a testament to his skill and dedication. A melody drifted from the nearby town square, a cheerful tune that hinted at the warmth of the summer day. 


Elias paused, listening. His thoughts drifted away from the delicate curves of the cradle to his own quiet life, a life spent surrounded by the comforting scent of wood and the rhythmic hum of his tools. He was content, but lately, a faint restlessness had begun to stir within him, a whisper of something more waiting just beyond the familiar walls of his workshop.
