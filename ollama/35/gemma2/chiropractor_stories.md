The scent of sandalwood incense hung thick in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of eucalyptus oil and the faint metallic tang of sterile instruments. Sunlight slanted through dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness of Dr. Evelyn Albright's office. 

Evelyn ran a hand over the worn leather of her exam table, its smooth surface familiar beneath her fingertips. Outside, the Arizona desert stretched relentlessly, a sea of ochre and burnt orange under the merciless midday sun. Inside, however, time seemed to slow, held captive by the rhythmic ticking of an antique clock on the wall and the hushed murmurs of patients seeking solace from their aches and pains. 

Evelyn adjusted her crisp white coat, its collar crisp against her neck. Today was a typical Wednesday, filled with the familiar symphony of creaks and pops as she coaxed relief from tight muscles and misaligned spines. But beneath the routine, a sense of unease lingered in the air, like a tremor before an earthquake.  Evelyn couldn't shake the feeling that something unusual was about to occur, a disruption in the predictable rhythm of her life.
