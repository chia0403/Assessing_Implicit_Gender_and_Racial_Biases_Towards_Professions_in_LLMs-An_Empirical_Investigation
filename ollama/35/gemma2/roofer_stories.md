The morning sun, already fierce in July's grip, beat down on Elias Thorne’s back as he precariously balanced atop Mr. Henderson's Victorian home. The smell of tar and dust hung heavy in the air, mingling with the cloying sweetness of honeysuckle blooming by the crumbling brick wall.  Elias tugged his faded baseball cap lower, shielding his eyes from the glare reflecting off the freshly laid shingles. He whistled a tuneless melody, its rhythm dictated by the rhythmic clang of his hammer against the copper flashing.

Mr. Henderson's house was a patchwork quilt of colors – peeling crimson siding on the second floor, moss-green trim that whispered secrets to the wind, and a sky-blue dormer window where a lone hummingbird flitted from bloom to bloom in a pot of geraniums. The roof itself was Elias’s canvas for the day, each shingle he placed a brushstroke against the aging canvas of the house.  

Today, however, there was more than just shingles and sun on his mind. Rumors had been swirling through the neighborhood about a string of break-ins, each targeting homes with elaborate gardens like Mr. Henderson's, and Elias couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. He scanned the street below – deserted but for a lone jogger in bright yellow spandex – and felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine.
