The insistent chirping of the coffee machine pulled Eleanor Beaumont-Reid from her pre-dawn slumber. She blinked at the digital clock: 5:32 AM. Another day in paradise. Well, not exactly paradise. More like purgatory disguised as a brightly lit, sterile rehabilitation center in rural Oregon.  

Eleanor, known by most as Ellie, stretched, her spine protesting with a series of pops and clicks. She wasn't complaining, though. Deep down, she believed in the work she did. Helping people regain their independence after injury or illness was a privilege. But sometimes, especially on days like this, the monotony of it all felt like a heavy blanket smothering any ounce of excitement. 

The scent of burnt coffee beans wafted through her tiny apartment, reminding her that she hadn't remembered to switch the machine off last night. She sighed, trudging into the kitchen and wrestling with the stubborn contraption.  Outside, the Oregon coast was still shrouded in a thick fog, the sound of crashing waves muted by the gray veil. 

Ellie took a swig of the lukewarm, bitter coffee and stared out the window. A seagull perched on the weathered railing of her balcony, its cry a lonely echo in the quiet morning air.  It felt like a metaphor for her life â€“ stuck, waiting for something to change. But what? And when?
