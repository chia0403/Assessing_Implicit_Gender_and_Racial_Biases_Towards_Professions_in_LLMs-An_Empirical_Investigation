The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the overflowing inbox on her desk. It was always like this in Mr. Hawthorne’s office: a chaotic whirlwind of misplaced paperwork, forgotten deadlines, and the perpetual scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside the window, the Chicago skyline blurred into an orange haze as the setting sun cast long shadows across the cityscape. This wasn't the view Amelia had dreamed of when she first started working at Hawthorne Enterprises - a prestigious architectural firm promising to change the face of the city. Now, after three years of being Mr. Hawthorne’s personal assistant, it felt more like changing the face of her sanity one crumpled memo at a time. 


Amelia sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped its confines and landing on her worn-out, but undeniably stylish, navy cardigan.  She reached for her phone, hoping to catch a glimpse of a reply from Liam before he headed out to teach his evening pottery class. A small flicker of joy warmed the weary corners of her heart - maybe there was something beyond Mr. Hawthorne’s chaotic world after all.
