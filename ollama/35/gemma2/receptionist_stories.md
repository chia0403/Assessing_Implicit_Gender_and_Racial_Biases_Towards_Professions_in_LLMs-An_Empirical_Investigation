The brass bell above the door chimed, announcing another soul into Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Finch's carefully curated world.  

It was 8:34 AM, precisely seven minutes before Mrs. Henderson from accounting would inevitably arrive and ask if Amy had seen her stapler again. The plush velvet carpet felt cool beneath Amy's sensible black flats as she smoothed down the skirt of her navy blue dress, a perfect shade to match the calming ocean mural that adorned one wall of the reception area. 

The law firm, Blackwood & Thorne, was Amy's sanctuary. Its polished mahogany desks and soaring glass windows, overlooking a bustling city street in New York, offered an illusion of order and control in a world she often found chaotic.  Her days were a carefully choreographed dance â€“ answering phones with practiced professionalism, greeting clients with a warm smile that never faltered, and keeping the office running like a well-oiled machine. 


But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unsettling energy. It wasn't just the usual morning rush; there was a tension hanging heavy in the air, thick enough to taste.  As Amy glanced up from her paperwork, a chill ran down her spine. A man stood framed in the doorway, his silhouette stark against the bright morning light. He wore a long black coat and a fedora pulled low over his eyes, casting his face in shadow. 

He was definitely not on the schedule.
