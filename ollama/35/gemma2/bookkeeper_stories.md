The flickering fluorescent lights of the "Books & Beans" coffee shop cast a sickly yellow glow over Elara Beatrice Finch's meticulously organized spreadsheets. She hunched over her laptop, her brow furrowed in concentration as she reconciled last month's accounts for Mrs. Peabody's antique teacup collection business. A symphony of clattering ceramic mugs and murmured conversations played around her, but Elara existed in a world of figures and debit entries. 

The setting was a cozy haven nestled on the edge of a bustling market square in the historic district of Charleston. Rain hammered against the large storefront windows, blurring the colorful facades of the neighboring shops into impressionistic swirls.  Elara loved this time of day â€“ the quiet lull before the evening rush, when the aroma of freshly brewed coffee mingled with the scent of rain-soaked cobblestone. 


It was during one of these lulls that a customer would walk in, shaking raindrops from their coat and disrupting Elara's peaceful world.  Little did she know, this particular customer would change everything.
