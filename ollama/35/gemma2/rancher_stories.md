The wind whipped across Clara Juniper’s weathered face, tasting of dust and distant rain. She squinted at the horizon, where the sky bled into the ochre-colored plains of the Panhandle. It had been weeks since the last decent shower, and the grass was starting to wither under the relentless Texas sun. Her trusty steed, Gus, shifted impatiently beneath her, his flanks slick with sweat.

Clara ran Juniper Ranch, a sprawling 500 acres inherited from her grandfather. She’d never wanted anything more than this life – the freedom of the open land, the rhythm of the seasons, and the quiet company of her cattle.  But this year, the drought was testing her like never before. The well was running dry, the livestock were gaunt, and the bank was breathing down her neck for payment on a loan she'd taken out to buy new fencing. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the parched land, painting the world in shades of orange and purple. It was a beautiful sight, but Clara couldn’t find any solace in it. She knew tomorrow would bring more hardship, and a gnawing anxiety settled deep within her stomach. Would she be able to hold onto Juniper Ranch, the legacy her grandfather had left her?
