The humid Florida air hung heavy, clinging to Esmeralda “Esme” Valencia like a second skin as she hurried through the bustling Farmer’s Market.  Vibrant colors assaulted her eyes – crimson tomatoes glistening under the morning sun, emerald kale piled high in wicker baskets, and sunflowers that seemed to reach for the sky. The scent of freshly baked bread mingled with the earthy aroma of blooming jasmine, creating a heady mix that both energized and overwhelmed Esme. 

She weaved through the throngs of people, her bright pink hair (a temporary dye job, thankfully) bobbing against her shoulders as she navigated a sea of denim shorts, linen dresses, and floppy sun hats. Reaching her destination, a small stall adorned with hand-painted signs advertising “Esme’s Beauty Bar,” she let out a sigh of relief. The market was chaotic, but it was also her haven – a space where creativity met community, and Esme could truly be herself.


This Saturday, however, a different kind of chaos awaited her. A whispered rumor had snaked its way through the stalls, casting a shadow over her usual sunny disposition. Something big was happening. Something that threatened to change everything.
