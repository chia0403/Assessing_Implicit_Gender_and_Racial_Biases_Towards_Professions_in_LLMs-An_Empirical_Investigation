The rain hammered against the windshield like a thousand tiny fists, blurring the city lights into shimmering halos. Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, better known as "Amy" to her colleagues, gripped the steering wheel tighter, knuckles white against the worn leather. The siren wailed, its mournful cry swallowed by the storm's fury.  

They were racing towards Mercy Hospital, the flashing blue and red lights cutting a desperate path through the deluge. Amy glanced at the monitor strapped to her chest, the EKG tracing irregular, panicked rhythms. A young boy, no older than ten, was fighting for his life in the backseat. He'd been hit by a car, an accident seemingly innocuous yet carrying consequences too severe for his fragile frame.

The city itself seemed to be mirroring the boy's struggle. Towering skyscrapers huddled against the onslaught, their glass facades reflecting the turbulent sky. The usually vibrant streets were deserted, swallowed by the swirling darkness. Even the air tasted of rain and fear.


Amy felt a familiar pressure build behind her eyes, the weight of responsibility settling like a leaden cloak.  She had to stay focused. She couldn't afford to falter, not when every second counted. Not when a young life hung in the balance. The hospital was their only hope.
