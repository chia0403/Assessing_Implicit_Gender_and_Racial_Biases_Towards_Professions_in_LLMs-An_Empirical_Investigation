The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of "Bargain Bin Bonanza."  Dust motes danced in the thin air, illuminated like miniature galaxies against the backdrop of mismatched shelves overflowing with clearance items.  A faint aroma of stale popcorn lingered from the long-defunct concession stand at the back of the store, a ghostly reminder of happier times before the manager had decided to "repurpose" it as storage for chipped mugs and broken plastic toys. Amelia ran her fingers along the worn countertop, her gaze drifting to the digital clock that blinked 3:47 PM.  Another hour until she could escape this purgatory and head home to her cat, Schr√∂dinger, who was undoubtedly plotting a world-domination scheme while he napped.


Just as she was contemplating the existential dread of being trapped in a dead-end job at a discount store, the bell above the door jangled, announcing a customer. Amelia forced a smile, hoping against hope that it wasn't another frantic teenager looking for discounted ramen or a middle-aged man trying to barter a broken toaster oven for a half-price box of cereal.
