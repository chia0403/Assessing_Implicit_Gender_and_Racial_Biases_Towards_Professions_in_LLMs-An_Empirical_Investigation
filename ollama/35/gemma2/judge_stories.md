The humid Georgia air hung heavy in Judge Amelia Beaumont’s chambers, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and old law books. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, casting elongated shadows across the mahogany desk where she sat. Outside, the courthouse clock chimed four times, each clang echoing through the quiet room like a hammer blow against the stillness.

Elias Thorne*. A simple theft case, at least on the surface. But something about it gnawed at her, a prickling unease she couldn't shake. The details were sparse, but the defendant’s name was familiar – and so was the stolen object: a worn, leather-bound journal, its pages filled with secrets best left buried.
