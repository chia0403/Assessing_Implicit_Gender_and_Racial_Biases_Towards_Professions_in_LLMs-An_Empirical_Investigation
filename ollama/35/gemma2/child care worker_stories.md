The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of banana bread and the faint tang of chlorine from the pool outside.  Elara Mae Blackwood sighed, pushing back a stray blonde curl that had fallen into her eyes. Another Saturday morning at Sunnyside Daycare meant another symphony of shrieks, giggles, and the occasional dramatic wail. 

Sunnyside was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a town where every house seemed to boast a perfectly manicured lawn and the smell of freshly baked pies lingered on every breeze. It was a picture-perfect community, if a little too saccharine for Elara's taste. She preferred the gritty edges of the city, the anonymity of crowds, but she found herself here, surrounded by sticky hands and boundless energy, caring for twenty rambunctious children aged three to five.  


It wasn't that Elara disliked children.  She simply preferred them in measured doses, not the overwhelming tsunami that was Sunnyside on a Saturday morning.
