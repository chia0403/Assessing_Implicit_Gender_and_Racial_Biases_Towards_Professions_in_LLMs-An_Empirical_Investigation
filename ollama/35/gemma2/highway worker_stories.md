The sun beat down on Elias James “Eli” Thornton’s neck like a blacksmith’s hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he squinted at the asphalt ribbon unfurl before him, shimmering under the relentless August heat.  

Eli worked for County Line Paving, keeping Highway 17 snaking through the Montana wilderness in decent enough shape to ferry tourists and locals alike between dusty towns. He spent most days elbow-deep in gravel or battling stubborn potholes with a jackhammer that vibrated up his arms like a live wire. Today was different, though.  Today, they were laying fresh asphalt, a task Eli found oddly satisfying, watching the smooth black ribbon snake across the highway, burying the rough patches and imperfections beneath it.

The wind whipped through the tall pines lining the road, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and sagebrush, a familiar aroma that usually calmed Eli's nerves. But today, a prickling unease sat on his skin, a feeling he couldn’t shake off.  As if something was watching him from the woods, hidden beneath the rustling leaves. He pushed the thought aside, focusing on the rhythmic clang of his tamper as he pressed the hot asphalt into place. 


The setting is a desolate stretch of Highway 17 in the Montana wilderness, under a scorching August sun. The air is thick with the scent of pine and sagebrush, but there's also an underlying tension that makes Eli uneasy.
