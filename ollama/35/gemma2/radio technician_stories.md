The humid Florida air clung to Elias Beckett like a second skin as he crouched beside the sputtering AM radio tower. The rusted ladder creaked under his weight, a discordant symphony against the buzzing cicadas filling the twilight air. Below him, the sprawling citrus groves of Lake Wales stretched out, their leaves shimmering like emerald waves in the dying sunlight. 

Elias, with his grease-stained overalls and unruly brown hair, felt more at home amongst these towering metal structures than amidst the manicured lawns of civilization. The radio tower, a relic from a bygone era, was his kingdom – a tangle of wires, vacuum tubes, and crackling static that whispered secrets of the world beyond the groves. He knew its every hum and groan, could diagnose a fault with a mere touch.  

Tonight, though, the familiar symphony was off-key. A low, insistent whine emanated from the heart of the tower, a sound Elias had never heard before. It prickled at his skin, raising goosebumps like miniature antennae. He gripped his tool belt tighter, a knot of apprehension tightening in his gut. This wasn't a simple fix. This was something… different.
