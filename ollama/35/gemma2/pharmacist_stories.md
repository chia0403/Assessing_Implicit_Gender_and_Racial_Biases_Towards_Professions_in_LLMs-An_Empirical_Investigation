The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the rows of brightly colored pill bottles lining the shelves. A bell chimed softly as Amelia Beatrice Cartwright, or Amy as everyone called her, stepped out from behind the counter and into the small pharmacy's waiting area. It smelled faintly of antiseptic and lavender hand sanitizer – a scent that had become as familiar to Amy as her own heartbeat. 

The town of Oakhaven wasn't much bigger than a pinprick on the map, nestled between rolling hills and a winding river, its main street lined with quaint shops and cozy cafes. The pharmacy, tucked away on one corner, was more than just a place to fill prescriptions; it was the heart of the community, a place where gossip flowed as freely as the cough syrup, and Amy knew everyone by name – their ailments, their families, even their favorite candy bar.

But today, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, thick and palpable like the humidity that had settled over Oakhaven this summer. Amy couldn't quite place it, but a prickle of unease crawled up her spine.  A woman sat on the worn leather chairs by the window, her face pale and drawn, clutching a crumpled note in her hand. She looked up as Amy approached, her eyes wide with an unspoken plea.


Amy knew this wasn't just another refill. This was something bigger, something that threatened to unravel the delicate fabric of their small world.
