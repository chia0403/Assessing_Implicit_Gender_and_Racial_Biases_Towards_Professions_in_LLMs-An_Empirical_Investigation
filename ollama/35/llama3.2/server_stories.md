The dim glow of the neon sign creaked in the gentle breeze as it cast its reflection onto the wet pavement outside the door of McGillicuddy's Pub. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of stale beer and yesterday's conversations. Amidst the hum of clinking glasses and muted laughter, 25-year-old Emmeline "Evie" Sullivan polished a mug with a white apron wrapped tightly around her waist.

As she expertly slid a plate of fried chicken wings onto a waiting table, Evie's eyes scanned the room, taking in the familiar faces of regulars sipping pints and chatting over trivia night. The pub was a staple in the small town of Oakdale, where everyone knew everyone, and Evie had grown up behind the bar, learning the ins and outs of the business from her father. But tonight felt different – the atmosphere was electric, with a group of rowdy college kids on spring break and a local musician set to take the stage in an hour's time.

Evie's gaze lingered on the door, where a young woman stood hesitantly, clutching a small suitcase and eyeing the crowd with a mix of curiosity and trepidation. Evie felt a spark of recognition, though she couldn't quite place her – it wasn't until the woman's eyes met hers that Evie knew this newcomer was about to shake things up in McGillicuddy's forever.
