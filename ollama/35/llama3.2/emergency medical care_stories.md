Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Story Opening:**

As the sirens wailed outside her hospital room window, Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson couldn't shake off the feeling of unease that had been growing inside her for weeks. A senior paramedic with 10 years of experience, Lexi had seen her fair share of traumas and emergencies, but nothing could have prepared her for the sense of disconnection she felt after a recent shift gone wrong.

**Setting:**

The story takes place in the bustling city of New Haven, where the emergency medical services (EMS) department is based at Mercy General Hospital. The hospital is located on the outskirts of the city, surrounded by the vibrant streets of downtown New Haven. The EMS team is tasked with responding to emergencies across the city, from life-threatening car accidents to medical evacuations in remote areas.

Lexi's shift had ended just hours before, and she was still reeling from the events that had transpired during her last call. A patient had been critically injured in a shooting, and despite Lexi's team's best efforts, they had been unable to save him. The feeling of failure and guilt had lingered with her long after she'd finished her report and changed out of her uniform.

As the night wore on, Lexi couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. She felt restless, like there was a storm brewing inside her, waiting to be unleashed. Little did she know, this would be just the beginning of a series of events that would test her skills as an EMT and push her to confront the darkest corners of herself.

The neon lights of New Haven's streets reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the city. The sound of sirens echoed through the night air, a constant reminder that emergencies were always just around the corner. And for Lexi, this was just the beginning of a long and difficult journey to redemption.
