Here's a potential story opening:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the sky, casting the city in a warm orange glow, Elliot James Wellington polished his glasses for what felt like the hundredth time that evening. A bell hop at the swanky Bellwether Hotel, Elliot had grown accustomed to the hustle and bustle of downtown's elite, but tonight felt different. Maybe it was the air thick with anticipation as the guests prepared for the city's most exclusive New Year's Eve party, or maybe it was the nagging sense that something was off, like a faint echo in the background of his mind.

Elliot, dressed in his crisp black suit and sporting his signature slicked-back hair, stood at the entrance of the Bellwether, surveying the crowd with an air of quiet confidence. He had worked at the hotel for five years, and in that time, he'd seen it all – the champagne toasts, the diamond ring proposals, the whispered secrets shared between strangers in the lobby's plush armchairs. But as the clock struck nine, signaling the start of the countdown to midnight, Elliot couldn't shake the feeling that this night would be different.

The city outside seemed to vibrate with tension, like a guitar string strummed just so. And at the heart of it all was Elliot, poised and ready to serve the evening's revelers with his usual charm and precision – but with a growing sense that something beneath the surface was waiting to be uncovered.
