As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy town of Willow Creek, hairstylist extraordinaire, Ruby Mae Reynolds, stirred from her cozy apartment above the local vintage shop. The soft hum of the old record player she had named "Bertha" still lingered in the air, a gentle accompaniment to the quiet morning hours. Ruby stretched her arms, yawned, and swung her legs over the side of the bed, her feet dangling in the air as she gazed out the window at the sleepy streets below.

The town was slowly coming to life – the early risers were filtering out of their homes, and the sounds of sizzling coffee and chatter began to fill the air. Ruby smiled, feeling a sense of contentment wash over her. She loved this time of day, when the world felt like it was holding its breath in anticipation of the new day ahead.

As she made her way downstairs, Bertha's vinyl crackled back to life, playing a soft rendition of "Moon River" that seemed to match the rhythm of Ruby's own heartbeat. She slipped on a pair of worn jeans and a faded band t-shirt, grabbed her trusty scissors and comb, and set off for the salon, ready to face whatever the day might bring – including a particularly demanding client who was rumored to be coming in for a last-minute appointment before her wedding rehearsal.
