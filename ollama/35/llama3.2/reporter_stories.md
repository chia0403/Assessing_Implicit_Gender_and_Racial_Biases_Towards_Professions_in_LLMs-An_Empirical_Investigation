Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven gleamed like polished onyx as Evelyn Rose Wellesley stepped out of her small apartment building, her eyes fixed on the old clock tower looming in the distance. The clock's chimes echoed through the misty air, marking the start of another drizzly evening in this coastal town.

As a reporter for the New Haven Gazette, Evelyn had grown accustomed to the city's perpetual grayness, but tonight felt different. Tonight, she sensed that something was stirring beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.

Evelyn adjusted her worn denim jacket and slung her camera bag over her shoulder, the familiar weight a comforting presence as she set out to chase down leads on the latest development in town: the mysterious disappearance of local business owner, Reginald Thornton-Pierce. The police were stumped, and Evelyn was determined to get to the bottom of it.

She hailed a taxi on the corner of Main and Elm, giving the driver an address that would take him straight to the waterfront district where Reggie's boutique had stood vacant for weeks. As they sped away from the curb, Evelyn gazed out into the rain-soaked night, her mind already racing with theories and questions. This story was going to be big, she could feel it.

Little did she know, the evening would bring more than just leads â€“ it would bring secrets, surprises, and a journey that would take her to the very heart of New Haven's dark underbelly.
