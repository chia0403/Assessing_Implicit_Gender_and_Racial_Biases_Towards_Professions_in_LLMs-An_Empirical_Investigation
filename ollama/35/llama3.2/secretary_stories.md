Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the small town of Willow Creek like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy shroud over the crumbling Main Street. Inside the dingy office building where Emilia Victoria Jenkins worked as a secretary, the fluorescent lights hummed above her desk, casting an eerie glow on the rows of dusty files and worn furniture.

Emilia, a petite woman with curly brown hair and wire-rimmed glasses perched on the end of her nose, pushed aside her thoughts of the impending storm and focused on the stack of papers in front of her. She had spent the morning sorting through receipts and invoices for the local hardware store, but her mind kept wandering to the mysterious letter she had received that morning.

The letter was addressed to her, but there was no return address and no indication of who might have sent it. The words "Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight. Come alone." were scrawled in red ink across the top page, making Emilia's heart skip a beat as she wondered what could be behind such cryptic instructions.

As she carefully filed away the last of the papers and shut her computer down for the day, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this letter. She tried to push the thoughts aside, telling herself it was just her imagination running wild, but as she glanced out the window at the rain-soaked streets below, she couldn't help but feel a sense of unease wash over her.

Little did Emilia know, this was only the beginning of a night that would change everything.
