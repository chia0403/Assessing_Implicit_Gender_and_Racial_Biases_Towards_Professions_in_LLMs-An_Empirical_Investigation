Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The fluorescent lights overhead cast a sterile glow over the cramped waiting area of Dr. Lee's medical practice, illuminating the tired faces of the patients who lingered in their chairs, waiting for their appointments to be called. Behind the front desk, receptionist Emily Jane Wilson gazed blankly at her computer screen as she mechanically typed out patient records and confirmed appointments on her days off.

As the sun began to set outside, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy suburban neighborhood, Emily's thoughts wandered from the drudgery of her job. She had always dreamed of leaving this small town behind, chasing her passion for photography and travel to more vibrant cities. But life had taken a different turn. After college, she'd returned home with high hopes and a degree in communications, only to find herself stuck in a dead-end receptionist role at her father's medical practice.

As the afternoon drew to a close, Emily's mind began to wander to the mysterious letter that had arrived in the mail earlier that day. The plain white envelope was addressed to her, with no return address or indication of who might have sent it. The single sentence inside read: "Meet me at the old oak tree at midnight if you want to escape."
