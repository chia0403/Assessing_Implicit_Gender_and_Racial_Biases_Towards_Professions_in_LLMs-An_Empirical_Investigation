Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexander Ryker Wellington stood at the edge of the small hospital room, his eyes fixed on the faint pulse beating steadily in the wrist of the young patient lying before him. The soft hum of the fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the sterile environment, and the scent of disinfectant and sweat hung heavy in the air.

It was 3:47 AM on a chilly autumn evening in late November, and the hospital was quiet, save for the occasional beep of a monitor or rustle of fabric. Dr. Wellington's eyes, tired from a long shift at the emergency room, scanned the chart on his clipboard, committing every detail to memory.

The police were still waiting for an ambulance to arrive with Emily's parents, and Dr. Wellington was the only doctor on call for this late-night shift.

As he studied Emily's chart, Dr. Wellington couldn't shake off the feeling that something wasn't quite right. The patient's vitals were stable, but her injuries seemed... unusual. A small laceration above her left eyebrow, a bruise on her cheekbone, and what looked like a faint scratch on her upper arm - but no visible wounds or broken bones.
