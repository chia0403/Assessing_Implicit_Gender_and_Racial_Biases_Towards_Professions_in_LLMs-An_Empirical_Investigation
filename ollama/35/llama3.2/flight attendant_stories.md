As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the sky, Aurora "Rory" Wynter gazed out the cockpit window of Flight 213, a small regional jet soaring through the darkness towards the distant glow of Denver's International Airport. The soft hum of the engines and the gentle rocking of the aircraft were the only sounds that broke the silence of the night air.

Rory, with her long, curly brown hair and piercing green eyes, stood tall amidst the cabin, surveying the rows of seats as she prepared for the overnight flight to Denver. She was a seasoned flight attendant, with over five years of experience under her belt, and had worked on countless flights across the country. But tonight was different - tonight was the one that would test her skills, her nerves, and her resolve.

The storm system that had been brewing all day had finally begun to intensify, its dark clouds stretching out like an unforgiving shroud over the mountains. The air traffic control warnings had grown more urgent, and Rory's captain, Mike, had sounded a stern note on the intercom: "Prepare for turbulence, crew." As she began her pre-flight checks, Rory felt a thrill of adrenaline mixed with a healthy dose of trepidation - this was going to be one long night.
