Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The fluorescent lights above the school's cafeteria ceiling hummed in unison with the quiet murmur of lunchtime chatter, casting an eerie glow over the emptying hallways. It was 12:45 PM on a typical Wednesday afternoon at Lincoln High School, and most students were oblivious to the fact that their janitor, Julian Michael Reed, had just witnessed something extraordinary.

Julian, a lanky man in his mid-30s with a scruffy beard and a penchant for rumpled khakis, pushed his cart of trash cans down the deserted corridor. He'd worked at Lincoln High for over five years, quietly maintaining the school's cleanliness despite being largely invisible to its students and faculty. Julian took pride in his work, but he also had a nagging feeling that something was off today.

As he turned the corner onto the cafeteria wing, Julian noticed that the usually spotless floor seemed to be speckled with an unusual number of crumbs and spills. He shook his head, chalking it up to the lunch rush, but his instincts told him otherwise. Suddenly, a faint scent of smoke wafted through the air, making his heart skip a beat.

Julian's eyes scanned the area, taking in the rows of empty tables and chairs. The cafeteria was usually bustling during lunch, but today it seemed deserted... except for one thing: a small, neatly folded piece of paper on the floor near the trash cans.

Julian's mind began racing with questions: What could be so important that the principal would want him involved? And what exactly had happened to make her need such secrecy?

With the invitation clutched in his hand, Julian felt like he was about to embark on a journey that would change everything. Little did he know, the events of this ordinary-seeming school day were only the beginning of an extraordinary adventure for the humble janitor...
