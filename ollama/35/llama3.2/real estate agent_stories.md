Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glowed like polished onyx in the dim light of evening, casting long shadows behind the towering skyscrapers of the city's financial district. Inside her cozy office, nestled between a vintage bookstore and a Korean restaurant, real estate agent Emilia Kwon poured herself a steaming cup of jasmine tea, the fragrance wafting up to mingle with the scent of fresh paint and stale air.

As she sipped her tea, Emilia gazed out the window at the wet pavement, her mind preoccupied with the peculiar property listing that had crossed her desk earlier that day. A dilapidated Victorian mansion in Capitol Hill, rumored to be haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a reclusive millionaire named Malcolm Wychwood. The seller was willing to let it go for a song â€“ but Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that there was more to this listing than met the eye.

Little did she know, her investigation into the mysterious mansion would set off a chain reaction of events that would test her skills as an agent and push her to confront secrets about her own family's past.
