Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glowed like a dirty mirror in the dim light of the evening, casting long shadows behind the towering buildings that seemed to lean in, as if they were sharing secrets. In a small, cluttered office above a used bookstore on Capitol Hill, Jack "Mac" McAllister sat hunched over his desk, nursing a lukewarm cup of coffee and staring at the latest file from a mysterious client.

A soft knock at the door broke the silence, and Mac's eyes flickered up to see his partner, Lena Grant, a petite woman with a sharp jawline and an IQ that rivaled Mac's own. She slipped into the chair opposite him, her eyes scanning the room before focusing on the file.

"Anything new?" she asked, her voice low and even.

Mac shook his head, cradling the cup in his hands. "Just more questions than answers. The client wants me to dig up dirt on some guy named Victor LaGrange. Says he's been making waves in the business world, but refuses to give any specifics."

Lena raised an eyebrow. "Sounds like a classic fish story. You think there's substance to it?"

Mac shrugged, his eyes drifting back to the file. "I don't know yet, but I'm going to find out. Victor LaGrange is about to become my most interesting client in months."

As Mac began to pour over the file, the sound of raindrops pattering on the roof seemed to grow louder, like a drumbeat calling him into the darkness outside. Little did he know, this case would take him down a rabbit hole of corruption, deceit, and secrets that would challenge everything he thought he knew about the city and its inhabitants.

The name "Jack 'Mac' McAllister" is now established as the main character in this private detective story.
