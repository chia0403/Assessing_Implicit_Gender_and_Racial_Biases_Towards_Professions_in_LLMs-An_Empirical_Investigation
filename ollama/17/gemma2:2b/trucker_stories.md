The Nevada desert stretched out before him like an arid canvas, cracked earth shimmering under the relentless sun. Dust devils danced across the parched landscape, swirling erratically as Carl "Dusty"  McCullough craned his neck, searching for any sign of life in the desolate expanse. His beat-up Kenworth rig, nicknamed "Betsy," hummed a lonely tune beneath him, its air conditioner struggling to keep pace with the unforgiving heat.

Carl, known across countless highway miles as just “Dusty,” had been driving for three decades. He'd seen it all: towering mesas sculpted by time and wind, shimmering lakes that held their secrets close, and ghost towns whispering tales of forgotten dreams. But this stretch of desolate interstate felt different, a quiet hum of tension vibrating in the air.  

He parked Betsy on the shoulder, the familiar rumble of her engine dying down to a low growl. The air was thick with the dry scent of sagebrush and the promise of coming rain, but it didn't alleviate the nagging sense of unease that had been growing inside him all day. A feeling he couldn’t quite place. 

His hand rested on his worn leather vest pocket containing a battered paperback copy of "The Odyssey," his grandfather's favorite book. It was a comfort, a reminder of home and adventure. Yet the story felt oddly detached today, unable to offer solace from the unease that had gripped him since he passed through El Paso yesterday.
