The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Frank "Fingers" O'Malley's latest conquest – a forgotten coffee stain on the polished mahogany floor of the old law library. He’d been scrubbing and swishing for twenty minutes now, each movement a measured rhythm in the symphony of silence that permeated the room after everyone else had left for their nightly escapades into the world of legal drama and high-society intrigue.  It was the kind of place where dust bunnies held court on ornate antique bookshelves, and the silence was thick enough to cut with a rusty butter knife. 

Frank’s worn canvas shoes tapped against the linoleum, the sound swallowed by the oppressive quiet.  He hummed along to an internal monologue - "Clean floors, clear head," he muttered under his breath. A man accustomed to dust, grime and stale coffee fumes, Frank had found a strange solace in the mundane act of keeping this forgotten sanctuary sparkling. 

Frank's days were a tapestry woven with the threads of cleaning supplies, mop water, and the lingering scent of burnt toast – the daily ritual that kept him anchored to this quiet corner of the universe. 


**Setting:** A sprawling old law library, steeped in history and brimming with the weight of secrets whispered through countless years. It's a place where legal battles were fought, arguments debated, and destinies changed - all under the watchful gaze of dusty tomes and antique furniture.
