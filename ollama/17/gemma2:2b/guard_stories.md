The flickering gaslight casts long shadows on the cobblestone courtyard as Silas Thorne, Sergeant at Arms to the esteemed Lord Abernathy, adjusts his helmet. It's always been a rough job; guarding the gates, being responsible for the safety of a lord and his family. Today is particularly daunting, though, thanks to the swirling autumn wind that chills even the stone walls of the manor. The air carries with it an icy threat of snow, not unlike the apprehension gnawing at Silas's gut.

Lord Abernathy, known for his vast wealth and opulent lifestyle, was due back from a diplomatic trip in the neighboring kingdom, bringing news of an unprecedented alliance that promised to shape the future of their land. Silas, ever loyal and wary, stood vigilant beneath the heavy oak doors of the manor, his eyes scanning every corner, every shadow. The silence hung thick as cobwebs, punctuated only by the occasional creak of the ancient structure or the distant howl of a stray dog searching for warmth. Tonight was the night; tonight, they would know if the alliance had materialized or if their future lay in ruin.
