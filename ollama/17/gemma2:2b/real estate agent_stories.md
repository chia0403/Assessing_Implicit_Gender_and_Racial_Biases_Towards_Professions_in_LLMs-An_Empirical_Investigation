## Story Opening: The Magnolia Dream 

**Setting:**  The bustling heart of Savannah, Georgia. Oak trees draped in Spanish moss shade quaint squares filled with antebellum architecture. A cobblestone path leads to a historic storefront, its faded blue paint a vibrant splash against the grey stone. Inside, the scent of magnolia blossoms hangs heavy and sweet, a jarring contrast to the harsh fluorescent lights that illuminate the dusty office. 

**Main Character:**  Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne, known affectionately as "The Magnolia Whisperer" in the local community. A woman with hair like spun copper and eyes like melted caramel, Amy's smile could charm even the most reluctant buyer. Though she has spent years selling houses, her heart always yearned for something more, a longing reflected in the faded magnolia drawing hanging above her desk. 

**Opening lines:**  "There's magic in these streets," Amy murmured to herself, brushing a stray strand of hair from her face as she looked at the worn photograph. "But sometimes, it gets lost." She traced the outline of a woman with auburn curls and a mischievous grin, holding her little niece's hand under the watchful gaze of a massive oak tree draped in ivy. "Maybe that's what my life is missing." 

**What happens next?** The photograph isn't just any image; it's Amelia's last memory of her grandmother, Eleanor Hawthorne - the legendary owner of the historic Magnolia Manor which she inherited and attempted to restore. But, with time, the dream has turned into a burden.  Now, a new client arrives at Amy’s office: Mrs. Elizabeth Montgomery, an eccentric recluse who wants to sell her beloved "The Raven's Nest" - a sprawling Victorian home rumored to be haunted. 

**What will happen?** How does this case link back to the dream of restoring The Magnolia Manor and what secrets does it hold?  How will Amy’s past intertwine with this new client, creating an unexpected journey through Savannah’s hidden corners and its lingering ghosts?
