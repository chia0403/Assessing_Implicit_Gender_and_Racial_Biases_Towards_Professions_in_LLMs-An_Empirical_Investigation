## The Whispering Pines

The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, clinging to Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood's worn leather gloves like a familiar shroud. The sun was already dipping below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of burnt orange and bruised purple as he surveyed the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor. A lone figure sat perched on a stone bench beneath the ancient weeping willow, its roots gnarled and intertwined with the centuries-old stones that formed the manor's foundation. 

Teddy was known to be quiet, more comfortable amongst the rustling leaves than in the bustle of human company. For decades he had tended to the sprawling grounds of Blackwood Manor, his life a silent symphony of rakes, shears, and careful pruning. But something felt different tonight. The air thrummed with an unseen energy, prickling Teddy's skin like static electricity.

The whispers began as a breeze brushed against him, carrying a faint melody, a sorrowful lament that seemed to seep from the heart of the ancient pines that stood sentinel along the manor's perimeter.  Teddy knew better than most what these murmurs meant - they were not just the wind, not just rustling leaves. They were the voices of the woods, the echoes of forgotten stories, and tonight, they held a secret too deep to ignore.
