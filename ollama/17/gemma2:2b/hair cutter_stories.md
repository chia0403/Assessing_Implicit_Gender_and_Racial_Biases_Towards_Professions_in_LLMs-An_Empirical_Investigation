Rain hammered against the windowpanes of "Scissors & Suds," the familiar clatter like a metronome keeping time with Amelia's rhythmic shears. She hummed along to her favorite 80's power ballad, eyes glued to the mirror as she worked.  The late afternoon sun slanted in, casting long shadows across the small shop, but it couldn't quite illuminate the storm brewing inside Amelia, a tempest of emotions only a good set of clippers could calm. 

Amelia "Amy" Sinclair was known for two things: her unparalleled talent with scissors and her uncanny ability to read people like an open book. This talent came in handy as she helped folks find their most flattering cut - or, more often, the one they needed to avoid embarrassment at the next family gathering. However, today felt different. A knot of anxiety tightened its grip on her chest. Her latest client had been unusually quiet; a stark contrast to his usual boisterous self. He looked like a wilted rose as he sat in the chair, fingers tracing patterns against the frayed fabric of his shirt. 

This was about more than just cutting hair; it felt like the start of something bigger - something potentially messy and unpredictable.
