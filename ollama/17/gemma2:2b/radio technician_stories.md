The whirring of the ventilation system was the only sound louder than Elara's anxiety in the control room.  Dust motes danced across the fluorescent lights, illuminating the grid of wires snaking across metal surfaces like an alien spider web. Elara sat at her station, a worn-out headset resting on the side of her face as she listened to the crackling static on the main frequency. The signal was faint â€“ almost swallowed by the city's relentless hum. 

She checked the dials and switches one last time, their familiar grooves a comfort in this sterile, high-tech haven. "Five One Three," Elara murmured under her breath, tracing the worn inscription on the control panel. It stood for five miles out from the coast line, an island off the beaten path, where she worked as the lone radio technician for the Coastguard's outpost.  A thick fog had rolled in this morning, shrouding the surrounding waters and making it nearly impossible to make a clear connection with anyone outside of their small, isolated community. 

Elara was just about to give up hope when a distorted voice crackled through the speaker. "Mayday! Mayday! SOS! Repeat... SOS!"  The signal was weak, fragmented, but undeniably there. It was coming from somewhere in the churning fog that seemed to mock her efforts with its suffocating density.
