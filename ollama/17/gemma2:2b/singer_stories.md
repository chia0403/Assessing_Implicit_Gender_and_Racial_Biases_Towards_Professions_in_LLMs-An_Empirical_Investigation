The rain hammered against the neon-bright facade of The Last Chance Saloon, each drop like a tiny drumbeat in the swirling storm outside. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of cheap beer and despair, punctuated by a haze of smoke from countless cigarettes.  This wasn't exactly Serena Van Derlin's usual haunt, but tonight was one of those nights when even a world-renowned opera singer like her felt the pull of the melancholy undertow. 

Her name was synonymous with soaring melodies and crystalline voices that could cut through the most hardened heart. But tonight, Serenaâ€™s voice felt trapped in a cage of self-doubt. Her upcoming concert at the opulent Grand Palace Auditorium had been her dream for years, but after weeks of grueling rehearsals and mounting pressure from critics, she felt anything but ready. The weight of expectations pressed down on her like the humidity clinging to the air. 
  
The bar stools were lined up against the stage like soldiers awaiting a call to arms. A lone spotlight played over a dusty guitar case sitting under one of them.  Serena approached the man behind it, a gaunt figure whose weathered face held the weight of countless late nights and unspoken stories. His name was Jasper, The Last Chance Saloon's resident musician and her only confidante in this storm of self-doubt. 


"He is here," said Jasper as he raised his voice to Serena's silent plea for solace. "You are not alone."
