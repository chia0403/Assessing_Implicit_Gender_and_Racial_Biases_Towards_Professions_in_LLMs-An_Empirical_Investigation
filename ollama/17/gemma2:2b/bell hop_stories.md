The crisp January air hung heavy with anticipation, smelling faintly of coal smoke and hot coffee from the nearby diner. It bit at Amelia "Amy" Bell’s cheeks as she hurried across the marble foyer of The Grand Majestic Hotel. Her worn leather gloves clutched a stack of fresh linens, her eyes scanning for the room number to check in on Mrs. Hawthorne. 

The hotel was an imposing beast - ornate Victorian, with gilded balconies and towering staircases that spiraled into the silent abyss above.  She'd been working here for three years now, ever since she lost her mother, a tragic accident which left her clinging to hope of a better life in this bustling city. 
The Grand Majestic was a monument to dreams, a place where fortunes were made and lost in the same breath, and Amy clung to that hope like a lifeline.  Her life had been one of silent work, tending to the needs of the hotel's inhabitants while she quietly dreamed of something bigger - something that wouldn’t involve endless night shifts and late-night cleanings.
