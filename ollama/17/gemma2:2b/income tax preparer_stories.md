The fluorescent hum of the office lights was the only soundtrack to Evelyn "Eve" Sterling's Friday evening. It was a symphony of boredom she’d learned to endure as well as anyone could. Her clients were coming in droves; people just didn't have time for their taxes anymore than they had time for a hot cup of coffee and a good chat with someone who wasn't staring at the spreadsheet on her computer screen. Eve was used to it, though. She'd been doing this since college, after all, back when she first thought about working in accounting would be more glamorous than it actually was. 

The air hung thick with the scent of old coffee and fear as people shuffled through her door – a mix of teachers trying to figure out their deductions for classroom supplies, small business owners desperately wanting to avoid IRS scrutiny, and middle-aged professionals who'd just lost their dream jobs and were hoping to minimize their tax burden. Eve glanced at the clock on her desk - 7:30 pm. Another year, another mountain of paperwork. The office was a monument to the American dream’s absurdity – a cramped room with dusty files, flickering fluorescent lights, and a constant hum that reminded Eve of a broken heart trying to be mended by taxes.
