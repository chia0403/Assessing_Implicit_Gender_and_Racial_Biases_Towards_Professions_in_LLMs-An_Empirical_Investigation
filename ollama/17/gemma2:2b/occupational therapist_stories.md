## Setting: 

The sun, sinking low in the sky, painted Longview Retirement Village in hues of burnt orange and amethyst as Evelyn "Evie" Thorne pushed through the double doors of Room 204.  It was a haven for the elderly, nestled amongst sprawling oak trees and whispering willows, with a quaint little fountain splashing a melody of tranquility against the backdrop of a symphony orchestra playing on her headphones. This setting, with its comforting familiarity, was where Evie felt most at home - or as close to it as she could get.

## Character: 

Evie Thorne, a woman whose vibrant personality and quick smile rivaled the cheerful hues of the blooming magnolia trees in the courtyard, had become synonymous with resilience for her residents.  While some might be skeptical of the gentle touch of an occupational therapist at Longview Retirement Village, where mobility was often hampered by age and time, Evie’s quiet determination and empathy offered a lifeline to those struggling with everyday tasks. 

## Opening: 

“Morning, sunshine!” Evie chimed, her eyes sparkling behind her thick-rimmed glasses as she entered the room.  Mrs. Peterson, her resident of choice, sat slumped in a wheelchair, staring forlornly at the peeling floral wallpaper bordering the windowsill. “How’s that lovely new tea set you've been using?” Evie asked, her tone both playful and concerned.   

Mrs. Peterson just groaned and muttered something about the "dusting" being “a terrible ordeal,” before trailing off into a silence deeper than any she had ever felt before.
