Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Earl "The Wrench" Thompson's tiny apartment, mimicking the relentless rhythm of his inner thoughts. The water in the sink was barely trickling, a pathetic trickle against the deluge that raged outside.  His phone vibrated on his workbench, another abandoned plumbing job notification. This time, it wasn't for an overflowing bathtub or a clogged garbage disposal; this one involved the city's new underground network of geothermal pipes – pipes prone to bursting in the unforgiving New England winters.

Earl ran a calloused hand over his beard, its gray hairs streaking out like ink across the canvas of his life.  At 52 years old, he was a veteran plumber with more wrinkles than miles on his trusty van, "Betsy." Her paint was faded, and her engine grumbled like an aging grizzly bear, but Betsy could hold up to Earl's gruff demeanor and unpredictable work schedule.

His workshop, crammed with pipes of every size, a toolbox overflowing with tools older than some of the city's founding fathers, was his sanctuary, a place he retreated to find solace amidst the chaos of everyday life.  But even here, the relentless storm outside seemed to echo the ever-growing emptiness inside him, mirroring the growing dread as another notification popped up: "Sewage spill – emergency call needed."
