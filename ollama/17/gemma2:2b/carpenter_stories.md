The air hung thick and humid, heavy with the scent of sawdust and pine.  A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves of the old oak trees that lined Hawthorne Creek, whispering secrets amongst their rustling limbs.  Ethan Thorne, his weathered hands clasped tightly around a mug of lukewarm coffee, watched the sky turn from azure to bruised purple as the sun dipped below the horizon. His workshop, nestled in the heart of Willow Creek's oldest district, was bathed in the last rays of daylight, its windows showcasing a patchwork quilt of wood-grained warmth and cool, pale blue moonlight that slithered in through the gaps in the boarded shutters.  

Ethan had built this very workshop from scratch. A legacy project of sorts, passed down from his grandfather who'd done the same. The workshop was a sanctuary for Ethan, a haven from the ever-present humdrum of Willow Creek life; a place where wood whispered its stories to him and he transformed their silent echoes into sturdy homes, graceful furniture, and sometimes even whimsical toys for the children in town. 
But tonight, his usual tranquility felt strained. The silence of the workshop was broken only by Ethan's ragged breathing as he wrestled with a stubborn piece of oak, its grain defiant against the chisels that clawed at it. A nagging unease settled like dust on his heart, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth. He knew something was amiss. Something felt off,  not just in this quiet workshop, but in the very air around him, like a phantom draft from an unseen wind had crept into the room and chilled him to the bone.
