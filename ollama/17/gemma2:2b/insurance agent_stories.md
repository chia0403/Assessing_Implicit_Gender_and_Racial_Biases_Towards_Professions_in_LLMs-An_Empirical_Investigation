Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Eleanor Blackwood's office, blurring the world outside into streaks of grey and emerald green. The scent of rain-soaked earth clung to the air, a sharp contrast to the floral perfume she always wore.  Eleanor, her auburn hair tucked neatly beneath a sensible, charcoal fedora, sighed and leaned back in her creaky leather chair. 

Her phone rang, jarring her from her contemplative state. "Mrs. Henderson?  Yes, it's Eleanor." Her voice, usually warm and soothing as she dealt with anxieties of policy renewals and unfortunate house fires, came out flat and clipped. This wasn't a usual call. It was the kind that made even seasoned insurance agents like Eleanor feel a creeping unease.

"Just got off the phone with Mr. Thompson," Mrs. Henderson's voice whispered over the line, laden with a quiet dread. "Heâ€¦ he thinks someone's been watching him."  


**Setting:** A small, cozy office nestled in a quiet corner of Oakhaven, a bustling town where life moved at a leisurely pace. 

**Main character:** Eleanor Blackwood, an insurance agent known for her calm demeanor and sharp wit who had seen it all - from broken promises to sudden bursts of generosity when faced with unexpected tragedy.  Eleanor was meticulous, but she also had a secret: the quiet, hidden world of the supernatural fascinated her, and sometimes, those whispers of fate felt strangely real in her small corner of Oakhaven.
