The rain hammered against Dr. Amelia Thorne's window like someone trying to shatter the glass with their grief.  Amelia stared out into the storm-tossed night, her reflection warped and blurry in the greasy sheen of water on the pane. In her small London flat, normally brimming with the comforting aroma of chamomile tea and old books, a thick tension clung to the air as she dialed another number. 

The line crackled like static before a weary voice answered. "Amelia? It's time."

**Setting:** A cozy yet cramped flat in London's vibrant but often-overlooked Notting Hill neighborhood.  It's filled with books, medical journals, and the quiet murmur of hope and desperation that hangs heavy in the air after another long shift at St. Bartholomewâ€™s Hospital. 

**Character:** Dr. Amelia Thorne - a brilliant yet deeply conflicted doctor working on the front lines of the NHS. She is haunted by the ghosts of past patients she couldn't save, burdened by a sense of responsibility for those who rely on her, and struggling to find balance in a life consumed by medicine.
