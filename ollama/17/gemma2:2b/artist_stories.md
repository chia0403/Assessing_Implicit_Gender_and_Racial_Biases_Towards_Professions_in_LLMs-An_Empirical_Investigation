The air hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine, a familiar comfort in Amelia Everly's tiny studio tucked away on the top floor of a century-old townhouse in Edinburgh. Rain lashed against the grime-coated windows, blurring the cobblestone streets below into watercolor smears of grey and brown. The roar of the wind echoed through her windowpanes as if trying to shatter the fragile calm of the evening. 

Amelia, with her vibrant auburn hair pulled back into a tight bun, hunched over her canvas. Her usual palette - a riot of blues and greens, inspired by the turbulent Scottish skies - lay scattered before her in front of a single sun-drenched window. It was here she poured her soul onto the canvas; transforming the swirling chaos of emotion into tangible form with every brushstroke. 

Today, however, something felt different. A tightness in her chest, like an unfurling storm cloud, threatened to swallow her creativity whole. The melancholic symphony of the wind and rain seemed to amplify this unease, each gust a harsh chord against her soul. Even the vibrant hues that usually pulsed through her art felt muted, their vibrancy dulled by the growing darkness within.
