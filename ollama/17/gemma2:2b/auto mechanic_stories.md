The morning sun sliced through the greasy grime of Earl's Auto Shop, painting long, thin strips of light on the faded blue paint of his workbenches. It was 5:00 am, which meant the usual symphony of engine coughs and screeching brakes had been replaced by the gentle hum of the refrigerator and the rhythmic clanging of the washing machine that Earl used to pre-treat his tools with a concoction of bleach and dawn. 

Earl Thornton wasn't just an auto mechanic; he was a man who understood every grumble, groan, and squeak under the hood of any car he touched, from rusted old beaters to sleek modern sports cars. He could sniff out a faulty spark plug from miles away, his weathered hands knowing exactly which wrench to grab. 

But this morning, Earl felt different. A tightness sat in his chest, something not entirely unpleasant. It was the kind of feeling that came with anticipation â€“ he'd received a call from Mrs. Peterson, who, for reasons unknown, insisted on being picked up at dawn by someone who wouldn't "rattle her nerves" like some of his younger colleagues. The engine of her classic 1967 Mustang, affectionately nicknamed "The Stallion," had sputtered its last and needed to be revived before the sun rose over the bayside town of Sunset Bay.
