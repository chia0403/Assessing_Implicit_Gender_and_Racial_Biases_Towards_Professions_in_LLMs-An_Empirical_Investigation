The scent of jasmine blossoms clung to the air, thick as fog on a Parisian morning. It was a smell that clung to Madame Laetitia Beaumont's very being – even in the frigid December chill seeping through the worn velvet drapes of the Château de l’Orangerie.  She stepped into the grand hall, her silver-chained heels echoing against the polished marble floor of the hotel lobby. As always, it was a symphony of silence - broken only by the occasional rustle of an old newspaper or a hushed whisper from the lone maid diligently polishing a dusty vase. This was her world: a sanctuary of hushed elegance and timeless decorum. 

Her name was Laetitia Beaumont – not just "Laeti" to her friends and colleagues, but  the concierge that could anticipate your needs before you even knew you had them. Tonight, though, the silence seemed heavier than usual. It wasn't the kind of stillness found in a library after closing time; it was the weight of unspoken expectations and the hushed tension held by the family she served. 

"Everything alright, Madame?" she inquired to the elderly maid who stood silently behind her, her eyes trained on the worn oak door leading into the grand ballroom. Laetitia's gaze shifted towards the heavy mahogany doors, their intricate carvings etched with scenes of French history – a silent testament to the life that unfolded within.
