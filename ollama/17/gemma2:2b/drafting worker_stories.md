## The Draftings of Despair

**Setting:**  A grimy, cramped apartment in Chicago's South Side. Dust motes dance in the thin afternoon light streaming through the cracked windowpane. 

**Character:** Elias Thorne, his calloused hands nervously twisting a worn leather notebook as he waits for his mentor, old Mr. Hanson.

Elias was born with a pencil in his hand. Not literally, of course, but a drafting worker since before he could walk, he'd spent his life sketching buildings and plans, dreaming of turning that world into concrete reality. He'd grown up in a world where the only skyward movement wasn't the birds flying overhead but the endless ascent of the city, each floor scraping higher than the last.

But today, Elias was stuck, trapped by a storm of his own making. A deadline loomed like a hungry raven on the horizon, threatening to swallow him whole. Mr. Hanson, a man whose age and beard looked older than time itself, had promised him guidance – but the drafts hadn't been flowing tonight, not since the news about his wife. 

His stomach growled. He just wanted something…anything…to break this monotony, a distraction from the silence of his apartment, the echoes of memories that wouldn’t be silenced by any draft he could make. His sketchbook lay open on the table beside him, a promise of fleeting solace; a testament to the dreams that seemed to slip further away with each passing moment.  
 
His fingers tightened around the notebook, its familiar worn edges offering no comfort tonight. He'd been drowning in this sea of despair since his wife, Sarah, had left. It was supposed to be a fresh start for them after their relocation; she’d even bought him that new drafting pencil set he’d dreamed of. The one Mr. Hanson swore could make "the impossible possible." Now the only thing impossible was finding hope within these lines. 


 
**Story Opening:** "She wouldn't have wanted me to crumble," Elias muttered, staring at a blank page in his notebook. The air felt thick and heavy, suffocating him like smoke from some old factory chimney. Mr. Hanson had promised him guidance, but all he’d found was this desolate room with its silence screaming louder than the city beyond.
