Rain lashed against the windowpane in Amelia Thorne's tiny office, each drop like a miniature drumbeat on the glass. The flickering fluorescent light did little to alleviate the gloom that hung thick in the air of "Thorn & Sons," an old-fashioned law firm with a decidedly outdated aesthetic.  Amelia sighed, idly tracing her finger across a sticky note pinned on the wall – “Don’t be scared, Mr. Thorne is just a bit... prickly." It was signed by a younger colleague, Emily, who seemed to harbor a secret, unspoken fascination for the grumpy, bespectacled lawyer whose name she couldn't quite bring herself to utter without giggling nervously.

Amelia worked at Thorn & Sons as a receptionist, her days filled with a symphony of phone calls, urgent inquiries, and the relentless ticking clock. While others saw it as a mundane existence, Amelia found a peculiar sort of solace in the chaos. The flow of people and the steady stream of legal jargon was almost like a hypnotic dance, each interaction another beat in the grand opera of law.  She wasn't sure why she felt so drawn to this symphony of confusion, but she did. 

Tonight, however, the usual calm was shattered when a man with a face etched with worry and a suitcase bursting with old, yellowed documents arrived at the office door, looking for Mr. Thorne himself. His name was Harrison Westcott, and he carried more secrets than the dusty books lining the shelves of Thorn & Sons' library.
