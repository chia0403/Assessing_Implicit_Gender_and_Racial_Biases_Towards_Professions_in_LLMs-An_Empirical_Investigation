The air hung thick and heavy over Willow Creek with the humidity only ever found in late July. It was a perfect day to be out trimming hedges, thought Leo "Lucky" Lawson, his worn baseball cap pulled low over his brow as he surveyed his usual patch of earth.  His fingers were calloused, strong like tree roots that anchored him to the ground, each one telling a story of hard work and years spent shaping nature's chaos into something beautiful. But this morning felt different. 

The familiar rhythm of his routine was disrupted by the sound of a rusty pickup truck rattling down the dirt road. Leo squinted at the faded "McAllister Estate" lettering emblazoned on the side, remembering how the old man who owned this property had once tried to sell him the job. A small smile played on his lips; the estate's owner was as stubborn as he was beautiful. Heâ€™d finally given up after years of polite rejections and a string of bad luck that seemed tied to this place. 

And then, right when Leo adjusted his clippers for another round of shrub trimming, the truck screeched to a halt just beyond the gate. A woman stepped out, her tall frame almost swallowed by a billowing floral print dress. He couldn't quite make out what she looked like, hidden behind a veil so thick that it mirrored his own years of trying to understand its mystery. The way she held herself, though - like the wind itself, she moved with an assured grace that seemed strangely familiar, even after all these years.  

Suddenly, Leo was standing in the middle of a world he thought he'd left behind.
