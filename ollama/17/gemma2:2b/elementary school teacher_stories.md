## The Whispering Classroom

**Setting:**  Oakhaven Elementary School, a sprawling brick building in the heart of suburban Iowa. It's a place where chipped paint on the lockers tells tales of years gone by and classrooms are often as predictable as the seasons themselves - except for Mrs. Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's fourth-grade class, which was anything but ordinary. 

**Main character:** Ellie Beaumont.  At 42, she had traded in her dreams of writing novels for the lifeblood of teaching. A former English major, Ellie still carried the weight of that unfulfilled passion, seeking solace in the quiet hum of children's voices and the vibrant bursts of creativity they brought to her classroom.  

The air hung heavy with the aroma of burnt sugar from the cafeteria's afternoon treat: cookies. Students were filing out of classrooms, their laughter echoing off the linoleum floors like a thousand tiny bells. Ellie stood at the door of her classroom, watching them go. 
A sudden draft rattled the windowpane.  Ellie glanced around – nothing seemed amiss, yet something felt off, an unsettling unease tugging at her mind. A whisper lingered in the air. "Something's happening," she said aloud, feeling a strange chill crawl down her spine. As if summoned by her words, a faint hum filled the room. The whispers intensified, forming into distinct voices –  children’s voices, but not from within the classroom walls. 

It was as if someone had opened a window to a different world. A world where the ordinary was anything but. Where magic, in its purest form, was waiting to be uncovered. 


**What will Ellie do? Will she uncover the secrets of the whispers?  Or will they remain an enigma in her classroom?**
