## Setting: 

The storm had ripped through Saltmarsh like a wild animal, tearing at the city with its howling wind and lashing rain. The streets were slick with mud and sewage, streetlights flickering in the gusts like dying stars.  A thick fog rolled in from the sea, obscuring the already bleak landscape of crumbling brick and rusted steel factories that clung to the city's edges.

## Character: 

The only one who seemed unaffected by the storm was **Silas "Slick" Donovan**. His worn leather jacket, stained with years of grime and countless spilled beers, held him upright against the wind as he surveyed his latest job site - a rickety Victorian house on the edge of town, its roof groaning under the weight of decades-old neglect. 

**Story Opening:**

Silas squinted through the driving rain.  He could feel the chill seep into his bones, but the steady rhythm of hammering and saw blades was a solace he clung to like a life preserver in a storm. He adjusted his worn beanie and muttered under his breath - "Another leaky roof for Mrs. Henderson's brood." 

As Silas climbed onto the crumbling wooden platform, the wind tore at him.  A gust slammed into the house, shaking its timbers and rattling the windows like bones in a graveyard. He tightened his grip on the ladder, steeling himself against the elements.  This storm was more than just rain - it felt like a harbinger of something deeper, an unsettling echo of the darkness lurking beneath the city's facade.
