## Setting: 

The attic of an old Victorian house in the seaside town of Oakhaven. It's August, the summer air thick with salt and memories. The windows are choked with cobwebs and sun-bleached photographs, but occasionally glimpses of green light flicker from behind a dusty bookshelf.  A single wooden chair sits bathed in the fading twilight, where Amelia Thorne spends most of her days – hunched over a tattered manuscript, fingers trailing across faded ink. 

## Character:

Amelia Thorne, her name a whisper on the wind that blows off the crashing waves. At 30 years old, she's still searching for inspiration, battling writer's block with each passing day. Her dreams are fueled by the stories of others - grand tales from dusty libraries and whispered secrets in dimly lit cafes. But Amelia yearns to write her own. She wants to paint a picture, not just tell one.

## Story Opening: 

"The lighthouse," she muttered, tracing the worn leather of the old notebook with a calloused thumb. The words swam before her eyes, like ghost ships on a stormy sea. "It was always there," Amelia said, her voice echoing in the cavernous space.  She had spent weeks circling it in her mind - a beacon against the encroaching darkness of doubt and rejection. It wasn't just a lighthouse; it was a symbol. A monument to hope, resilience, and perhaps even love. 


She looked up from the notebook. The old photographs on the wall seemed to mock her – faded faces, frozen in time. Each one held a fragment of a story that had never come to light.  And then, Amelia realised something: she wasn't just staring at ghosts; she was searching for them. For herself. 


The attic felt suffocating. A weight settled on her chest, pressing against her ribs like the tide creeping in on the shore. She closed her notebook, feeling a familiar pang of frustration. "Come on," she whispered to herself, as if coaxing a stubborn bird back to its nest.  "Show me what you want."
