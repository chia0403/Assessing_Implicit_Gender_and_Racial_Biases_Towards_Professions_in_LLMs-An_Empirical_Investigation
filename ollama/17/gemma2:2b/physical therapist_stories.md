The morning mist clung to the small town like an old sweater, its breathy tendrils barely lifting off the dew-laden grass as Elias Thorne stepped out of his car.  He adjusted the worn leather satchel slung across his shoulder, the familiar weight comforting despite its age – almost a constant companion since graduation. This was Havenwood, a place where time moved slower and people wore their hearts on their sleeves like worn patches on an old denim jacket. 

Elias had never quite fit in. He preferred the organized routine of his profession to the chaos of small-town life, but he'd stayed for family reasons – a legacy he felt compelled to uphold.  He'd come here as a young man, bright and eager to prove himself. Now, years later, his eagerness had been tempered by the quiet dignity of hard work and a profound understanding of human fallibility. He was Elias Thorne, PT - a title that held both respect and a hint of melancholy in its repetition.  

He looked across the lawn at the quaint, two-story house where Mrs. Odell lived - an elderly woman he’d been working with for the past six months. She'd suffered a stroke, her left side paralyzed, and Elias had dedicated himself to guiding her back to some semblance of independence. But today, there was something different about the silence emanating from the doorway. It wasn't just the morning chill; it felt... expectant.
