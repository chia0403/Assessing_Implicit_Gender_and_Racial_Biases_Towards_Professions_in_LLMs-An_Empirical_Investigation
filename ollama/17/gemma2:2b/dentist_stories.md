Dr. Amelia Sterling's office was no stranger to squeamish faces.  It wasn't the fluorescent lighting or the smell of chlorhexidine that unsettled patients; it was the sheer volume of them, all crammed into the waiting room like nervous beetles in a jar. The waiting room itself was an anomaly â€“ tucked away within a seemingly ordinary strip mall, it boasted stained glass depicting smiling teeth and whimsical dental instruments instead of the usual sterile waiting space.  Amelia sighed, her hand tracing a chipped ivory tooth replica on the waiting table, "Just another day," she thought wryly. 

**Setting:** A small, slightly-off-kilter office in a quiet part of San Francisco's Chinatown. The building boasts a whimsical facade with stained-glass teeth and whimsical dental instruments instead of the usual sterile waiting space.

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia Sterling, a young and compassionate dentist with an odd fascination for old-school dentistry techniques.
