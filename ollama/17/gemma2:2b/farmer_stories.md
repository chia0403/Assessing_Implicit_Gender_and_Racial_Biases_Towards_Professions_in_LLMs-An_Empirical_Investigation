The dust devils danced in the unrelenting heat, swirling around Silas Thorne's ankles as he knelt amongst his crops. His weathered face, framed by salt-and-pepper hair, creased with worry.

Years of drought had parched the land, leaving behind only skeletal stalks that swayed listlessly in the wind. Silas ran a calloused hand over his face, exhaustion clinging to him like a second skin.
