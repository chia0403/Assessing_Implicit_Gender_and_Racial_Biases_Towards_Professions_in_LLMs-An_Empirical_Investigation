The worn plush carpet muffled Amelia's heavy steps as she navigated the sprawling estate of Lord Barrington. Sunlight streamed through arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in an afternoon haze. A symphony of creaks and groans echoed throughout the vast house, each one reminding her of the weight she carried – both literal and metaphorical. In this manor filled with faded grandeur, Amelia was more than just a housekeeper; she was a silent witness to its history, a guardian of its memory. 

Her name was Amelia Thornhill, and for thirty years, she had been the unseen hand that kept Lord Barrington's crumbling castle afloat. From polishing silver in the echoing dining room to sweeping dust bunnies from cobweb-laden corners, she breathed life into the mansion’s forgotten grandeur. She had learned its rhythms: the quiet rustle of parchment as a new letter arrived, the unsettling silence when shadows deepened in the evening, and the weight of secrets heavier than any stone or brick. 

Today, however, something was different. A strange uneasiness gnawed at Amelia's gut. It felt like an unraveled thread in the tapestry of her life – a discordant note in a symphony of routine. The usual hum of activity had been replaced by an unsettling stillness. As she finished mopping the grand hall’s worn marble floor, a chill swept through the room.
