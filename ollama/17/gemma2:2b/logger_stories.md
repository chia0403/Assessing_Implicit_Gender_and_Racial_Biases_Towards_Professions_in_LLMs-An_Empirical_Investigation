The rain hammered against the canvas tarp overhead like a thousand tiny fists, each blow echoing in the cavernous space of Calvin “Cal” Blackwood’s cabin. Outside, the wind howled a mournful dirge through the towering pines that marked the edge of the Blackwood Forest – a forest so vast and ancient it whispered secrets of forgotten time and untold magic. Inside, Cal sat hunched at his worn oak table, the scent of pine needles mingling with the acrid tang of woodsmoke. The storm raged on, mirroring the turmoil brewing within him.  

For twenty years, Cal had worked the unforgiving Blackwood Forest, carving a life from its raw, untamed beauty. He'd learned to read the forest like an ancient tome, its silent language revealing hidden paths and secrets whispered in the rustle of leaves and the croak of ravens. But lately, something felt off - the usual rhythm of his life was disrupted, the familiar symphony of nature seemed discordant, replaced by a creeping unease that settled heavy in his chest like a stone. The forest itself seemed to whisper warnings, to speak of an ancient power stirring beneath its emerald surface, secrets buried deeper than the roots of old-growth trees.
