The air hung thick with the scent of burnt sugar and simmering herbs, a symphony only Elara could orchestrate into something palatable on this perpetually-drizzly Tuesday evening. Rain pounded against the awning outside "Chez L'Étoile," creating a rhythm that matched the relentless ticking of the clock above the stove. It was 8:02 PM, and Elara, her hands nimble as ever despite the persistent tremors in her left arm, was nearing the end of preparing tonight's special - roasted duck with lavender-infused jus and rosemary mashed potatoes. 

Chez L'Étoile wasn't a fancy establishment; it was more bistro than anything else. But within its creaky wooden walls, Elara had built a small empire. Every night, she poured her heart and soul into creating culinary masterpieces that drew in customers seeking solace in the familiar warmth of home-cooked meals. Tonight, however, a knot of unease twisted itself in Elara's stomach.
