The wind whipped across Silas Cartwright's worn face, carrying with it the scent of dust and sagebrush. His Stetson sat low on his brow, shadowing his eyes as blue as the Montana sky at midday.  He adjusted his weathered leather reins and surveyed his sprawling cattle ranch, a tapestry of emerald green grass and golden sunsets stretching towards the jagged peaks of the Rockies in the distance. The year was 1923, and this land had been his lifeline for the past thirty years. It held more memories than any man should have time to count -  the scent of freshly turned soil after his father's last rain-soaked day, the sound of young Will's laughter echoing across the fields, the silent pact he'd made with the earth when he first promised himself he wouldn't be swayed by city lights. 

A crow cawed from a gnarled oak tree near the barn, breaking the silence. Silas tightened his grip on the reins and looked towards the horizon, where the sun began to dip behind the jagged peaks of the mountains.  His thoughts were as far away as the land's edge, burdened by the weight of decisions he couldn't make. A storm was brewing in the distance, a dark premonition etched onto his furrowed brow. It wasnâ€™t just the weather, it was the quiet unease that settled deep within him like a stone. Silas Cartwright had always been a man who held to the land, and this time, it felt as if he was holding on for dear life.
