##  Story Opening:

Rain pattered against the stained glass windows of Miller’s Pharmacy, casting shifting kaleidoscopes across the worn linoleum floor.  Inside, Elara Miller meticulously counted out the pills in her hand – each one, carefully labeled with their potency and dosage – as she recited a mental list of the patients who would soon be filling these prescriptions. The air hung heavy with the smell of antiseptic and old wood, a comforting aroma that always calmed her nerves.  This was Elara’s haven – her tiny corner of the bustling city where she could channel her quiet intensity into healing.

But this evening felt different. The storm outside mirrored the unease gnawing at Elara's gut. The usually-optimistic smile on her patient’s face had faded, replaced by a stark worry etched deep in the lines around his tired eyes. "Miss Miller," he whispered, his voice barely audible over the relentless drumming of the rain, "I think it's worse than they thought."

**Setting:** A quaint, family-owned pharmacy nestled in a bustling city neighborhood. The interior is bathed in warm, nostalgic lighting with antique furniture and dusty shelves overflowing with remedies and medications from across the years.
