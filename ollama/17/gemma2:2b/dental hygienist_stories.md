The morning sun, filtered through the swirling dust motes in the air, illuminated Amelia “Amy” Davies’ workspace with an almost surreal glow.  Her small office was nestled within the bustling hub that was Willow Creek Dental, a place where chipped teeth and bad breath were commonplace yet somehow never outlandishly tragic. 

The steady hum of the dental drill in the next bay provided a rhythmic background to Amy's day – a familiar cadence she'd come to relish after years spent navigating the world of pearly whites.  Today, however, the usual comforting melody was tinged with an unnerving anxiety that had taken root deep within her chest.

Normally, Amy found this part of her job oddly satisfying, wielding her power like a scalpel, yet she couldn't shake the feeling that something was different about this case. A weight settled heavily on her shoulders as she prepared Mr. O’Connor's dental chair and looked at the file in his hand - a photo with a woman's smiling face.  The familiar pang of loneliness, a constant companion in Amy's life, flared within her.
