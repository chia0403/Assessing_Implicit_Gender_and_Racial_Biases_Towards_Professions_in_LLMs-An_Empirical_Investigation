Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of St. Jude's Mercy Hospital, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of the storm. Inside, the air hung thick with the mingled scent of antiseptic disinfectant and something deeper – sadness.  Nurse Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz, her normally fiery red curls now plastered to her forehead, knelt beside an unconscious woman on the bed. The woman's face was pale, etched with terror, a silent scream trapped in her closed lips. 

The storm had struck just as Esme had finished her night shift. A call had come through – someone was hurt, a car accident near the old mill ruins. She'd rushed in, adrenaline pumping, ready to deliver some semblance of calm before her own fear threatened to consume her. Now, she knew this patient wouldn't be leaving St. Jude's anytime soon. Not with the storm raging outside and a mystery that seemed as thick as the shadows clinging to the room.
