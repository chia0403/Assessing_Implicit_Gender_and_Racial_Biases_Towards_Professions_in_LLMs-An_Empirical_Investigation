Rain lashed against the windows of "The Crooked Compass," blurring the neon glow of "Open" into a watercolor smear. Inside, dust motes danced in the pale light filtering from the chipped stained-glass globe hanging above the bar. It was a quiet Friday night, even quieter than usual, and Elias's fingers idly tapped on a worn bartop as he poured another round of whiskey for a weary looking woman named Elsie.

It was the kind of place where secrets simmered with each passing hour and stories unfolded like the smoke curling off a forgotten cigarette. Elias, his real name was Elian, but 'Elias' felt right somehow; it fit the weathered walls and worn leather stools. He wasnâ€™t just a bartender at "The Crooked Compass," he was its resident chronicler, its silent guardian of tales whispered in dim corners.
