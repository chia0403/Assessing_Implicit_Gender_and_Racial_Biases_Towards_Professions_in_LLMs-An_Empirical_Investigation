The air hung thick with sugar cookies and unspoken worry as Amelia "Amy" Henderson finished tucking 4-year-old Leo into his playhouse fort.  It was an ordinary Tuesday in Mrs. O'Malley's Little Rascals daycare, but the familiar rhythm of afternoon snacks was now tinged with a sense of foreboding that Amy couldn't shake off. Leo looked unusually somber, bouncing his legs impatiently while trying to read a book about dinosaurs. 

Amy glanced at the calendar hanging on the wall – August was just days away and the anticipation for the annual summer camp registration day had everyone buzzing.  Except Mrs. O'Malley, who was as quiet as a mouse, her usually lively eyes clouded with worry.  The last few weeks had been difficult, ever since Mrs. O'Malley’s husband, John, unexpectedly passed away. The daycare, once a vibrant hub of children and laughter, seemed to be losing its shine.

Amy felt a weight settling on her shoulders as she glanced out the window at the sun setting in a blaze of orange and purple, mirroring the growing uncertainty within Mrs. O'Malley’s heart. As Amy walked over to tidy up the play area, she couldn’t shake off the feeling that this summer camp registration day could be more than just a simple event; it might hold the key to saving Mrs. O'Malley's beloved daycare and her husband's legacy.
