Outside, the bustling city was reduced to blurry streaks of grey light as thunder boomed like an angry god. Inside, however, Amy felt anything but grounded. A thick tension coiled around her stomach and a familiar itch pulsed beneath her skin â€“ the one that only came with watching a case unravel in a courtroom where words were weapons.

The Miller's story: a strained marriage, financial troubles, and accusations that the wife had stolen from her husband. The legal jargon swam before her eyes, each clause a knot in her stomach. The courtroom was just beyond this wall, a place where emotions ran raw and truth could be twisted into something sinister. Amy knew she would have to navigate this minefield, her words carefully chosen, ensuring justice wasn't lost in the storm of accusations and deceit.
