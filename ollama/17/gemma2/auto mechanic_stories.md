The air in Jax "Grease Monkey" Montgomery's garage was thick with the scent of motor oil, burnt rubber, and hope. Sunbeams slanted through dusty windows, illuminating swirling motes of sawdust and metallic flecks clinging to the worn wooden floorboards.  A symphony of clanging metal, whirring drills, and his own gravelly voice narrating his work filled the space. Jax, a mountain of a man with hands calloused like weathered leather, was hunched over a 1967 Mustang, its cherry red paint dulled by years of neglect. He was coaxing life back into the muscle car, piece by painstaking piece, just as he had coaxed life back into countless others in this tiny town nestled at the edge of the Arizona desert.  


This was his sanctuary, a refuge from the harsh realities that lurked just beyond his door â€“ a place where engines spoke a language he understood, and broken dreams could be rebuilt with grease and grit. But today, a new kind of challenge was about to roll into Jax's life, one that threatened to shake the very foundations of his world.
