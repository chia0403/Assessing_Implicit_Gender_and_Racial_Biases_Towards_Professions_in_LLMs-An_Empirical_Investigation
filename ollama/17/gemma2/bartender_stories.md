The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting a sickly green glow across Amelia "Amy" Juniper's face as she wiped down the already spotless countertop. The air inside The Rusty Mug was thick with the scent of stale beer and regret, a familiar aroma that clung to everything from the worn leather bar stools to the chipped mugs lining the shelves. A lone patron hunched over his whiskey in the corner, his shoulders slumped like a deflated balloon. 

Amy sighed, her breath fogging up momentarily in the cool night air. It was always slower on Wednesdays. Maybe it was the dreary weather, or maybe everyone had already exhausted their week's worth of misery by Tuesday. Either way, she needed to keep busy.  She reached for a bottle of gin, its label faded and peeling, a testament to countless nights like this one.


The Rusty Mug itself was an institution, a dive bar on the outskirts of Portland known for its cheap drinks, even cheaper clientele, and Amy's uncanny ability to listen without judgment. It wasn't glamorous, but it was home.
