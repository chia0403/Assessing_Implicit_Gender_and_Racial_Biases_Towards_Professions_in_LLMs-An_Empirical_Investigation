The scent of antiseptic mingled with lavender hand cream in Eleanor Rose Blackwood's nostrils as she entered the brightly-lit therapy room. Sunlight streamed through the expansive windows, casting dancing patterns on the textured floor mat beneath her feet.  Eleanor adjusted the strap of her canvas bag, its weight comforting against her hip. Inside, nestled amongst water bottles and fidget toys, was a worn copy of 'The Body Keeps The Score,' a reminder that healing wasn't always about physical strength, but about tending to the unseen wounds too. 

Today's patient, a young boy named Finn with expressive hazel eyes and a shy smile, was waiting patiently on a colourful mat, his leg encased in a bright yellow cast. He clutched a stuffed dragon, its scales stitched with vibrant greens and blues. Eleanor knelt beside him, her heart warming at the sight of his determined spirit, despite the recent accident that had landed him here. 


"Ready to make your dragon fly again, Finn?" she asked softly, pulling out a set of brightly coloured blocks from her bag.
