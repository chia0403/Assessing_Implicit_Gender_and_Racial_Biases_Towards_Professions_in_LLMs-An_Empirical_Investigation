The Oregon sun streamed through the dusty windows of Dr. Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s clinic, illuminating motes dancing in the air like miniature galaxies. A faint scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy, attempting to mask the earthy smell of cedarwood floors worn smooth by decades of foot traffic. Outside, the wind whispered through the towering Douglas firs that lined Willamette Street, their branches swaying like emerald arms reaching for the cerulean sky.

Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, stood gazing out at the bustling street corner from behind the reception desk.  Her patient’s file lay open on the counter before her: Thomas Jackson, 48, suffering from chronic lower back pain stemming from years of demanding work as a carpenter. Amelia sighed, tracing the lines of his file with a calloused fingertip. Another soul burdened by physical discomfort, another story waiting to be heard and hopefully healed. She adjusted the strap of her stethoscope, feeling the comforting weight against her chest, a constant reminder of her calling: to help others find relief through the magic touch of hands-on healing.
