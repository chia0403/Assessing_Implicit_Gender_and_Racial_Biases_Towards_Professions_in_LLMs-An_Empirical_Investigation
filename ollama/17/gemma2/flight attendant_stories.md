The humid air hung thick as Amelia Clementine adjusted her headset, the plastic digging slightly into her temple. She scanned the faces of the passengers boarding Flight 347, her smile practiced but genuine.  Singapore to London – another leg in her never-ending journey across continents, cultures, and ever-shifting time zones. The Boeing 777 thrummed with a low, comforting vibration beneath her feet. Its polished metal skin gleamed under the airport's harsh fluorescent lights, reflecting Amelia's own tired reflection back at her.  

The familiar routine of boarding, safety demonstrations, and pre-flight announcements washed over her like a warm wave. It was a life she’d chosen, traded in for adventure and fleeting moments of connection with strangers from all walks of life. Yet tonight, something felt different. A prickling unease danced beneath her skin, amplified by the low murmur of chatter that seemed to buzz with an undercurrent of tension.
