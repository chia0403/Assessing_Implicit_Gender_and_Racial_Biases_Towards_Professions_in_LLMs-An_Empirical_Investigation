The air hung thick with dust and the scent of granite. A sliver of morning sun pierced through the cracks in the corrugated iron roof of Silas Blackwood's workshop, illuminating motes dancing in the stale air. He wiped sweat from his brow, leaving a streak through the grime that had settled there over the weeks.  Silas ran a calloused hand over the rough surface of the granite block before him, its cool weight reassuringly familiar. This wasnâ€™t just any stone; it was a hunk of ancient bedrock, rumored to have been quarried from the very heart of Mount Cinderheart itself. A mountain whispered to be imbued with magic, a place shunned by most but coveted by those who sought power. Silas Blackwood, however, sought only beauty. He saw potential in every vein and fissure, every imperfection a chance to coax out the hidden art within. 


His workshop stood on the outskirts of Emberfall, a town nestled at the base of Mount Cinderheart. It was a place where reality blurred with folklore, where whispers of fire giants and obsidian dragons mingled with the clanging of blacksmiths and the scent of woodsmoke. Silas lived a solitary life, content in his world of stone and silence.  But that tranquility was about to be shattered.
