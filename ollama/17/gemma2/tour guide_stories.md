The humid Charleston air hung thick and heavy, clinging to Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Blackwood like a damp shroud.  She adjusted the straw hat perched atop her head, its wide brim offering little respite from the relentless July sun. The cobblestone streets of Rainbow Row shimmered in the heat haze, their pastel facades almost luminous. 

Amy surveyed the group of tourists shuffling behind her, a motley crew of retirees, selfie-stick wielding teenagers, and bewildered families with sticky-fingered toddlers. Her usual enthusiasm, which usually bubbled over like sweet tea on a summer day, felt sluggish. It wasn't just the heat; Charleston had been buzzing with unease lately. Whispers of strange happenings in the old houses, shadows flitting at the edge of vision, and unexplained chill spots were circulating faster than the humid air itself. 

"Alright everyone," Amy chirped, her voice a tad too chipper to mask the tremor of apprehension beneath, "Welcome to Charleston! Home of history, hospitality, and..." she hesitated, glancing at the imposing silhouette of the Battery looming against the horizon, "...the unexplained."
