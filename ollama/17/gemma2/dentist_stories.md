The midday sun slanted through the dusty windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Blackwood's dental practice, painting stripes across the sterile white tiles. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and faintly metallic fear. A lone whirring sound broke the quiet â€“ the sterilizer patiently purging its contents, a mechanical heartbeat in the otherwise hushed room.  

Amelia herself sat at her desk, fiddling with a miniature model of the human jaw, its ivory teeth meticulously crafted. She tapped on a molar with a gloved fingertip, lost in thought. It wasn't the usual pre-patient anxiety she felt; this gnawing worry stemmed from something far more personal, a creeping dread that had taken root like a stubborn cavity in her mind. 


Outside, the small town of Oakhaven hummed with its usual languid pace, oblivious to the storm brewing within Amelia's soul.
