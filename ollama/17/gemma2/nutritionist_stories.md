The aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg clung to Amelia Beatrice Croft like a comforting shroud. It was a scent that usually calmed her, grounding her in the familiar warmth of her kitchen amidst the whirlwind of her life as a celebrity nutritionist. But today, the spices did little to soothe the anxious knot twisting in Amelia's stomach. 

The sun, normally a welcome guest pouring through the stained-glass windows of her Victorian home, felt like a spotlight highlighting the mess on her countertop - scattered cookbooks, half-eaten granola bars, and a crumpled recipe for "Superfood Smoothie Supreme" that now seemed more like a cruel joke. She had been up all night, battling a migraine brought on by stress, trying to finalize the menu for Chef Ricardo's new organic restaurant, only to be met with his latest demand: gluten-free, vegan, sugar-free, and somehow still delicious. A recipe impossible, or so Amelia thought.

Her phone buzzed on the counter, reminding her of her upcoming meeting with Ms. Evelyn Sterling, a renowned actress who was rumored to be struggling with an eating disorder. This wasn't just another client; it was a high-profile case that could make or break Amelia's career. And right now, all she felt like doing was crawling back into bed and hiding under the covers until this migraine passed and the pressure subsided. 


Amelia sighed, took a deep breath of cinnamon air, and grabbed her phone. There was no use dwelling on it. She had a reputation to uphold, a client to help, and a recipe to conquer.
