The steel beams groaned under the weight of a November gale, rattling like cage bars against Amelia "Amy" Beaumont's ears as she climbed the scaffolding ladder. The wind whipped her hair across her face, stinging her cheeks with icy rain. Below, the construction site buzzed with frantic activity as workers scrambled to secure loose materials and find shelter from the storm. 

Amy pulled her wool cap lower, squinting at the skeletal frame of the building rising before her: a seven-story eco-friendly apartment complex dubbed "The Willow." It was her magnum opus, a project she'd poured every ounce of her passion and talent into for the past three years.  

Her fingers tightened around the blueprint clutched in her hand, tracing the lines that represented her vision - sustainable materials, innovative solar panels, interconnected green spaces.  Amy dreamt of The Willow as a haven, a sanctuary from the urban chaos, where residents could live in harmony with nature. But with this storm raging and the deadline looming ever closer, doubt began to creep into Amy's heart like a winter frost. 


The setting is a bustling construction site in a large city during a fierce November storm.
