The air in Dr. Elara Vance's office hummed with an undercurrent of anxiety. It wasn’t unusual; her patients often walked through those doors carrying a weight they couldn’t bear alone. But today, it felt different. Heavier. The scent of lavender from the diffuser seemed to struggle against the tension clinging to the worn velvet couch. Elara sat behind her desk, watching as sunlight slanted through the window, painting stripes across the faded Persian rug. 

Her office was tucked away on the third floor of a rambling Victorian building in Greenwich Village, New York City. Sunlight dappled the chipped paint of the windowsill, illuminating a collection of mismatched mugs – a remnant from her days as a coffee-shop barista before psychology stole her heart. The books lining the shelves were her solace: worn copies of Freud and Jung, nestled beside feminist critiques of psychiatry and self-help guides with titles promising instant happiness. But today, none of it felt comforting. 

The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, each second echoing the growing unease in Elara’s gut. She was waiting for her next patient, a woman named Amelia – a successful lawyer with a chillingly perfect life, who had requested an appointment citing "an overwhelming sense of emptiness."  Elara hadn't seen Amelia before, but she already felt a pull towards her, a sense that this session would be unlike any other.
