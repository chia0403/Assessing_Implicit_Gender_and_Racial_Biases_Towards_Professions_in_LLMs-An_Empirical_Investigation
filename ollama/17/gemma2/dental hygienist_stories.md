The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Willowbrook, casting a sterile glow over the rows of gleaming metal instruments. The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang that always seemed to permeate her dental practice. It was Wednesday morning, and Eleanor's schedule was already filling up. First on the list was Mrs. Petrov, notorious for her anxiety and a penchant for chewing on the end of her toothbrush handle during cleanings.

Eleanor took a deep breath, smoothing down the starched collar of her uniform. She loved dentistry – the meticulous precision, the ability to help people feel better about their smiles, even if it was just a small improvement.  But dealing with anxious patients like Mrs. Petrov sometimes tested her patience, especially on days when Eleanor felt her own anxieties bubbling up, threatening to spill over into the sterile world she'd built around herself.


Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine as she prepped for Mrs. Petrov’s appointment, a feeling that went beyond the usual stress of a busy morning. The air felt charged, and even the familiar whirring of the suction tubes sounded a little too loud.  Perhaps it was just a strange coincidence, Eleanor thought, trying to shake off the unsettling sensation. After all, every day brought its own unique set of challenges in her small, bustling dental practice nestled on Maple Street.
