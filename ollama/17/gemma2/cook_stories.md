The air hung thick with the scent of simmering broth and caramelized onions in Emilia Rose Hawthorne's tiny kitchen. Outside, the Parisian dawn was just beginning to bleed through the gauzy curtains, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floorboards. Emilia, her hair pulled back in a messy bun dusted with flour, hummed along to a French chanson playing faintly on the radio, stirring the pot of bouillabaisse with practiced precision.  Her apartment, perched above a bustling boulangerie on a cobbled street in Montmartre, was cramped but cozy, its walls adorned with faded posters of classic films and hand-drawn sketches of her favorite dishes. Today was Bastille Day, and Emilia's restaurant, "Le Petit Souffle," was booked solid. She was determined to make it the best celebration yet, serving up a feast that would transport each diner to the heart of Provence.
