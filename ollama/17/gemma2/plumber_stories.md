Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Benny "The Wrench" Worthington's workshop, each drop a tiny hammer blow on his already frayed nerves.  The stench of damp earth and stagnant water hung thick in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of copper pipe. 

Benny, his calloused hands wrapped around a steaming mug of coffee, peered out the grime-streaked window at the floodwaters lapping at his front porch. The storm had hit late last night, transforming his quiet corner of Willow Creek into a churning torrent. Phones were ringing off the hook with panicked homeowners reporting burst pipes and flooded basements. Benny sighed, pushing back his grease-stained cap.  It was going to be a long day.  

Willow Creek wasn't exactly known for its wealth or glamour. It was a town clinging stubbornly to life in the shadow of the sprawling metropolis just beyond the hills, a place where hard work was a virtue and everyone knew each other by name. Benny, with his battered toolbox, patched-up overalls, and reputation for fixing anything that sputtered, leaked, or broke, was as much a part of Willow Creek's fabric as its crumbling brick houses and winding dirt roads.  But today, even the familiar comfort of his workshop felt precarious under the weight of the relentless storm.
