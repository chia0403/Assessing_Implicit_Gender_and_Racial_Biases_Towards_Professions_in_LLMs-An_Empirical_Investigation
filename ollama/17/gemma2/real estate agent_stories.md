The humid Georgia air hung heavy as Amelia Grace Hawthorne surveyed the dilapidated Victorian on Oakhaven Drive. Its once-grand facade was marred by peeling paint and overgrown ivy, giving it the appearance of a forgotten relic from a bygone era. A rusty swing set creaked forlornly in the overgrown backyard, a silent testament to happier times.

There was a palpable weight about it, a sense of secrets whispering through the cracked walls.
