The air in Dr. Eleanor Vance's office was thick with anxiety, a scent Amelia Beatrice Perkins knew intimately. It clung to the floral carpet like a shroud, seeped into the worn leather of the waiting room chairs, and pulsed beneath her fingertips as she tapped out messages on her ancient, green-tinted computer.  

Amelia, perched behind her battered desk in the heart of Dr. Vanceâ€™s cluttered practice, was used to it. Every day, a parade of faces walked through those double doors, their expressions etched with worry, hope, and sometimes, a mixture of both. Some held onto medical records like talismans, others clutched at loved ones' hands for comfort. Amelia had seen it all, from the mundane anxieties of seasonal allergies to the devastating diagnoses that shattered lives. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across her small world: the faded artwork on the walls depicting idyllic landscapes that couldn't be further from the raw emotions swirling around them; the overflowing bookcase crammed with medical texts and dog-eared self-help manuals; the faint scent of lavender hand sanitizer struggling to mask the lingering aroma of fear.  

Today, a young woman sat in the waiting room, clutching a worn photograph. Amelia watched her through the half-closed door, her heart clenching. The young woman's shoulders were hunched, her head bowed, her face lost in shadows.  Amelia knew this familiar posture: a plea for solace, a desperate hope for answers. 


Today, someone needed her. And Amelia Beatrice Perkins, receptionist extraordinaire, would be ready.
