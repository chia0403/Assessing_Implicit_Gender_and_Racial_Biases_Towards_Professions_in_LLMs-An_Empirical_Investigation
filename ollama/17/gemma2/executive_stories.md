The midday sun beat down on the glass facade of Zenith Tower, making the sprawling cityscape shimmer like a mirage. Inside, Amelia Katherine Blackwood, CEO of Blackwood Industries, surveyed her domain from behind her mahogany desk. Her office was a monument to power and precision: sleek lines, minimalist décor, and floor-to-ceiling windows offering an uninterrupted view of the city's frenetic pulse.

Amelia wasn't fazed by the chaos below. She thrived on it. Every traffic light, every siren wail, every construction project – they were all pieces in a complex symphony she orchestrated with ruthless efficiency. But today, even Amelia felt a tremor of unease. A call from her brother earlier had left her with a knot of worry in her stomach. Something was wrong, something big, and it threatened to disrupt the carefully constructed world she'd built.
