The flickering neon sign outside the "Rusty Bucket" bar cast a sickly green glow across Amelia Grace Harper's face as she surveyed the scene. Rain lashed down, turning the asphalt into a treacherous mirror reflecting the swirling chaos. A half-empty beer bottle lay shattered on the sidewalk, shards glittering like fallen stars amidst the puddles. The air reeked of stale beer and something far more sinister – fear. 

Amelia, an EMT with years of experience dealing with the darker side of human nature, had seen her share of bar brawls. But this one felt different.  A thin line of blood stained the cobblestones leading to a crumpled figure sprawled against the back wall. Amelia knelt beside him, her practiced hands already working, assessing the damage. A deep gash on his forehead oozed crimson, and his chest rose and fell with shallow breaths. He was alive, but barely.


“Hold on, sir," Amelia murmured, her voice calm amidst the pandemonium. "We’re going to get you help."  But even as she spoke, a chill snaked down her spine. This wasn't just another drunken brawl. This felt personal. The glint of something sharp in the shadows beyond the rain-slicked street confirmed her suspicion – this night was about to get much worse.
