The hum of the vintage typewriter filled Amelia Celeste Harding's small office, a symphony of clacking keys punctuated by the occasional impatient sigh. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and regret – two aromas that had become permanent fixtures in her tiny world on the 12th floor of the grand Zenith Building. Outside, the Chicago skyline glittered under a merciless July sun, a stark contrast to the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light filtering through Amelia's window.  

Her boss, Mr. Archibald Thornton – a man who seemed perpetually shrouded in disapproval and powdered sugar – was currently locked in another meeting with his ever-growing roster of real estate "investors." This meant Amelia had time to stew over the latest draft of his speech for the upcoming property launch, a document riddled with clichés as tired as the carpet under her desk. 

She tapped her pencil against her teeth, her gaze drifting towards the framed photograph on her desk – a faded image of a younger, carefree Amelia, perched precariously on the edge of a Ferris wheel at the county fair.  That girl seemed a lifetime ago. Now, all that stood between Amelia and utter boredom was a stack of unanswered phone calls and a dwindling supply of coffee.
