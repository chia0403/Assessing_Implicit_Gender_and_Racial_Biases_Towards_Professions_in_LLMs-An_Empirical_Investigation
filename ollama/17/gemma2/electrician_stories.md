The acrid smell of ozone hung thick in the air, mingling with the damp scent of decaying wood that permeated Eleanor "Ellie" Blackwood's bones. The dilapidated Victorian mansion loomed above her, its once-grand facade now weathered and cracked like an old man's face. Rain lashed against the windows, each drop a tiny hammer blow on the already fragile glass. Ellie squinted through the downpour, tugging her beanie lower over her ears as she surveyed the scene. 

The call had come in just after midnight: "Power's out, strange humming sounds coming from the attic." A classic haunted house scenario, Ellie thought wryly, but she was an electrician, not a ghostbuster. Her job was to trace the problem, no matter how paranormal it seemed. Stepping onto the porch, she pushed open the creaking door and entered the mansion's maw, her trusty toolbox strapped across her shoulder, ready to face whatever electrical gremlins awaited her.
