The midday sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Harper's neck, turning her already sweat-soaked t-shirt into a second skin. Dust motes danced in the air, illuminated by a shaft of light slicing through the gaps in the half-built steel frame. Below her, the construction site buzzed with activity: gruff shouts echoing across the expanse, the rhythmic clang of hammers against metal, and the rumble of cement mixers churning like mechanical beasts. 

Amy gripped the railing of the platform, taking a moment to appreciate the dizzying view from fifty feet above ground. The sprawling city lay before her, a concrete jungle teeming with life, its skyscrapers reaching for the sky like metallic fingers grasping at the sun. 


This was Amy's domain. She wasn't afraid of heights, not anymore. In fact, she found a certain peace up here amongst the steel and wires, a sense of control amidst the chaos below. It was her sanctuary, her escape from the cramped apartment she shared with two roommates and the relentless pressure of juggling work and bills.
