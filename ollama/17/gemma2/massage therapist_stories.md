Amelia "Amy" Juniper adjusted the plush towel draped over her client's back, her fingers lingering on the tense knots that coiled beneath the surface. The room was a sanctuary: dim lights filtering through gauzy curtains, bamboo plants swaying in a gentle breeze, and soft, soulful music playing at barely audible volume. This was Amy's haven, her escape from the frenetic energy of the city just beyond the frosted glass windows. She found solace in easing the burdens she felt held captive within her clients’ bodies - physical knots mirroring the emotional strains they carried.

And something about him – the set of his jaw, the way he held his shoulders hunched - whispered of a story far more intricate than any he could have penned himself.
