The aroma of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of crayon wax and spilled juice – the signature perfume of Ms. Evelyn Harmony’s morning at "Little Sprouts Daycare."  

Evelyn hummed along to the cheesy pop song playing on the radio as she surveyed her domain: a chaotic tableau of scattered blocks, overturned toy trucks, and tiny humans in various states of pre-lunch exuberance. The morning had started with tears over missing shoes and ended with an impromptu dance party involving an inflatable banana and a suspiciously sticky blanket. 

Evelyn, with her bright pink hair pulled back into a messy bun and a perpetually smudged rainbow on her cheek (courtesy of little Timmy’s artistic endeavors), felt a familiar surge of affection for these tiny tornadoes she called her "little sprouts." They were exhausting, unpredictable, and sometimes downright messy, but their unfiltered joy was contagious.  


Setting: A brightly colored, bustling daycare center in a suburban neighborhood.
