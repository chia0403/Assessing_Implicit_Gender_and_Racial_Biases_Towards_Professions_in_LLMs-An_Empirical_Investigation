The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Vance's window, mimicking the relentless thrumming in her chest.  Her small office, tucked away on the third floor of an unassuming brick building in downtown Boston, felt more like a prison cell than a sanctuary tonight. The soft glow of the desk lamp illuminated stacks of files, each one a miniature universe of human pain and confusion, waiting to be untangled. Eleanor sighed, her breath misting in the cool air. It was nights like this, when the city throbbed with its own melancholic symphony, that she questioned if she could truly make a difference. 

Eleanor wasn't sure what had shifted within her lately â€“ perhaps it was the relentless stream of clients battling their demons, or maybe the creeping shadow of loneliness that seemed to follow her home every night. Whatever it was, the usual sense of purpose that fueled her work felt distant, replaced by a gnawing sense of inadequacy.  

As the last chime of the clock announced 6:00 pm, she finally allowed herself to shut down for the day.  The rain showed no sign of stopping, and the city lights outside seemed to dim in response to the storm's fury. Eleanor pulled on her coat, feeling the damp chill seep into her bones, and stepped out into the waiting darkness.
