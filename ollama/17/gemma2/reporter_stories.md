The stale air of the diner hung thick with the scent of burnt coffee and regret. Amelia “Amy” Beatrice Hawthorne hunched over her lukewarm mug, the fluorescent lights reflecting in her tired eyes. Her notepad lay open before her, filled with scribbled notes and crossed-out leads – all dead ends in the case that had consumed her for the past month. 

The town of Harmony Ridge, nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains, was anything but harmonious. Whispers of a hidden cult, bizarre disappearances, and unsettling ritualistic symbols carved into abandoned houses plagued the small community. Amy, an investigative reporter for the Asheville Gazette, had arrived with the ambition to unravel the truth, but so far, all she'd uncovered were walls of silence and evasive glances. 

Outside, the late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Main Street, where a solitary figure in a worn-out cowboy hat stood gazing towards the old abandoned mill on the outskirts of town – a place locals spoke of with hushed fear.  Amy knew this was the next stop on her investigation, whether she was ready for it or not.
