The sun, a molten fist in the bruised sky, hammered down on Silas Blackwood's calloused back as he knelt amongst his rows of corn. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the horizon where the golden stalks swayed like dancers in a silent, relentless wind. Dust devils pirouetted across the parched earth, mocking his desperate hopes for rain. This was the worst drought Silas had seen in his forty years tending these fields, and the worry gnawed at him like a persistent rat in his belly. 


The farm, nestled in the heart of the Red River Valley, stretched for miles, its patchwork quilt of cornfields, wheat, and fallow land bordered by the ever-shifting course of the river itself. The once fertile soil was now cracked and dry, resembling the dusty bottom of a forgotten well.  

Silas ran a hand over his sun-beaten face, squinting at the horizon again. He needed rain. His crops were withering, his livestock growing weaker by the day, and the bank's patience, like the river's flow, was running thin.
