The air hung thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation.  It wasn't the kind of atmosphere that usually inspired good music, but then again, Elara Seraphina never had much patience for convention. 

She perched on the edge of the rickety stage at The Rusty Spigot, a dimly lit dive bar nestled in the forgotten alleyways of New Albion.  The clientele - a motley crew of weary souls and hopeful dreamers - barely glanced her way as she strummed a hesitant chord on her battered guitar. 

A lone spotlight cut through the haze, illuminating Elara's face with its warm, unforgiving glow. Her eyes, the color of a storm-tossed sea, flickered across the audience, searching for a flicker of recognition, a spark of something real in the sea of apathy.


Her fingers tightened around the neck of her guitar. 

This was it. This was the moment she'd been working towards, dreaming about, since she was a child singing into a chipped teacup microphone.  Tonight, she would pour her heart out, raw and unfiltered, to whoever would listen. Tonight, Elara Seraphina would finally show them who she truly was.
