The stale scent of burnt coffee hung heavy in Amelia Beatrice Finch's office, mingling with the ever-present aroma of old paper and desperation. Rain lashed against the windowpane, each drop like a tiny hammer on the glass, echoing the relentless drumbeat in Amelia's head. 

She hunched over her desk, illuminated by the harsh glare of the overhead fluorescent light, her brow furrowed as she reread the file for the tenth time. It was a simple case, at least on paper: a small-time art dealer accused of forging a Van Gogh. But Amelia knew better than to trust appearances. The details were tangled, the motives murky, and something about it felt off â€“ like a discordant note in an otherwise harmonious melody. 

Her office, located in a faded brownstone building tucked away on a forgotten side street in Greenwich Village, was as much a reflection of her personality as the case itself: a jumble of legal documents, overflowing bookshelves, and scattered trinkets that whispered stories of past victories and defeats. Outside, the city throbbed with life, oblivious to the quiet drama unfolding within these walls. But for Amelia, every case, no matter how seemingly insignificant, was a universe unto itself, demanding her complete attention and unwavering commitment. 


The phone on her desk buzzed, snapping Amelia back to reality. It was likely Mr. Goldstein, her client, anxious for an update. With a sigh, Amelia reached for the receiver, bracing herself for the storm brewing both inside and outside her office.
