The air in Mildred Periwinkle’s office hummed with the low thrum of the vintage computer she'd salvaged from an antique shop. Dust motes danced in the single beam of sunlight filtering through the grimy windowpane, illuminating a desk piled high with receipts and invoices – a testament to Mildred's meticulous nature. Outside, the bustling city of New Albion roared to life, but within her small, cramped office on the fourth floor of an unremarkable brick building, time seemed to stand still.  

Mildred, her spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose and her grey hair pulled back in a tight bun, squinted at the ledger before her. A discrepancy, as subtle as a misplaced decimal point, gnawed at the edges of her mind. It was an anomaly she couldn’t ignore, a ripple in the otherwise predictable flow of numbers that constituted her world. This wasn't just another day crunching figures for local businesses; this felt different, like the faint tremor before an earthquake.
