The air hung heavy with the scent of pine needles and damp earth. Sunlight, filtered through the thick canopy above, cast dancing shadows on the forest floor where Silas Blackwood stood, axe resting against his calloused shoulder. A bead of sweat trickled down his temple, mingling with the grime that clung to his sun-weathered skin. He was a man carved from the very wood he felled, strong and silent, his every movement practiced and deliberate.

The towering pines surrounding him whispered secrets in the wind, a language Silas understood better than any spoken word. He had lived among these trees all his life, his small cabin nestled on the edge of this sprawling expanse of ancient forest in the remote Cascade Mountains of Washington state.  His father before him, his grandfather before that - generations of Blackwoods had made their living here, hewing timber and shaping its destiny. But lately, Silas felt a growing unease. The forest seemed to be shrinking around them, swallowed by the relentless march of progress, leaving behind scars on the land that refused to heal.
