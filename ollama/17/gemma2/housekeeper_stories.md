The scent of lavender polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea brewing downstairs.  Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne, known affectionately as Ellie to the few people she spoke to regularly, surveyed the drawing-room with a critical eye. The silver tray holding Mrs. Van Derlyn's afternoon tea sat untouched on a pedestal table, the delicate china cups gleaming under the warm glow of the chandelier. 

Ellie meticulously straightened a throw pillow perched precariously on the velvet chaise lounge, its embroidered floral pattern faded from years of sun exposure. This grand Victorian house, with its sprawling gardens and labyrinthine hallways, had been her home for twelve years - her silent companion, witness to her joys and sorrows, now a familiar stage in the play of her life. 


The setting sun cast long shadows across the polished oak floors, hinting at the approaching dusk. Outside, birdsong gave way to the distant rumble of traffic on Baker Street, a faint reminder that life pulsed beyond these gilded walls. Ellie sighed, knowing the evening would bring its own set of tasks: dusting the antique grandfather clock, polishing the crystal decanter for Mrs. Van Derlyn's nightly brandy, and finally, extinguishing the last flickering candle before settling into her cramped quarters in the attic. Another day done, another story whispered through the halls of this grand but lonely house.
