The humid Florida air hung heavy in Amelia "Amy" Grace Hawthorne's office, thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Outside, palm trees swayed lazily in the relentless sunshine, a stark contrast to the storm brewing inside Amy's small cubicle. Her phone sat on her desk, silent – an ominous absence considering it usually buzzed with frantic calls from anxious clients. 

Amy sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its braid.  It was the third Tuesday this month she'd been stuck in this purgatory of waiting. The hurricane season had brought more than just sunshine and palm trees; it brought chaos. Claims piled up faster than she could process them, leaving her drowning in paperwork and feeling increasingly useless. Today, however, felt different. A gnawing unease settled in her stomach, a premonition that something big was about to happen – something beyond another leaky roof or shattered window.  


It wasn't the usual kind of storm brewing in Amy's life; this one was personal. It had started with a cryptic phone call from a number she didn't recognize and an unsettling warning: "Your clients are not who they seem."
