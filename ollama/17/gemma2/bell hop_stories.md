The Grand Magnolia Hotel was a monument to faded grandeur. Its once pristine white facade now bore the scars of countless storms and indifferent sunbeams. The brass doorknobs, dulled with age, held onto their shine with stubborn tenacity, and the mahogany elevator doors groaned like an arthritic giant each time they opened. It was the kind of place where secrets lingered in the shadows, whispered by the rustling velvet curtains and echoing in the cavernous halls.

This is where Bartholomew "Bart" Fitzwilliam found himself every morning. He wasn't born a bellhop, no sir. His family had once held titles and wielded influence, but those days were long gone, swallowed by history like dust motes in sunlight. Now, Bart navigated the labyrinthine corridors of the Grand Magnolia with the practiced grace of a seasoned dancer, his polished shoes whispering across the worn carpets. 


He was a master of appearances: impeccably dressed in his crisp uniform, a polite smile perpetually plastered on his face, and eyes that held a world of unseen stories. Bart knew every guest by name, their preferences, their anxieties, and sometimes, their deepest desires. After all, he was the one who carried their burdens, both literal and figurative, day after day.
