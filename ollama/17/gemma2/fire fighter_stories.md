The acrid smell of smoke clung to Captain Amelia "Amy" Thorne like a second skin. She stood at the edge of the inferno, her helmet reflecting the dancing flames that consumed the old Victorian mansion across the street. The roar of the blaze was deafening, a symphony of crackling timber and shattering glass punctuated by the desperate cries for help from trapped souls within.  

The air hung heavy with heat, thick enough to taste, and Amy could feel sweat prickling under her turnout gear. This wasn't just another fire; this was a monster, fuelled by decades of accumulated debris and greedily consuming everything in its path. 

She took a deep breath, steeling herself against the fear that always threatened to creep into her heart during these moments. It was a fear for the lives entrusted to her, a fear for the unknown horrors that might be lurking within the flames. But above it all was the unwavering commitment, the oath she had sworn years ago: protect and serve, no matter the cost.  

This inferno was just another test, another chance to prove her worth. Amy tightened her grip on her axe and stepped into the maelstrom. 


The setting is a small, historic town in the American South, where old Victorian mansions line cobblestone streets. The fire rages through one such mansion on a humid summer night.
