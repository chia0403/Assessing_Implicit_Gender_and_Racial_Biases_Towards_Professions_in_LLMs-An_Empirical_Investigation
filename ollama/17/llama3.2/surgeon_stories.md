Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Emilia Alexandra Vasquez stepped out of the rain-soaked hospital parking garage, her eyes scanning the darkening streets of Manhattan as she fumbled for her keys in her soaked leather jacket pocket. The neon lights of the city's towering skyscrapers reflected off the wet pavement, casting an eerie glow over the deserted sidewalks. It was a typical New York evening, with the hustle and bustle of the day giving way to the quiet, sedate rhythms of night.

As a surgeon at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Emilia had spent countless hours in the operating room, her hands moving with precision and skill as she saved lives and restored health to those who needed it most. But tonight, she had taken a rare evening off, looking forward to unwinding with a drink and some time on her own after a long day of surgeries.

As she unlocked her apartment door and stepped inside, Emilia felt a sense of relief wash over her. She kicked off her shoes and slipped out of the damp jacket, letting it fall to the floor in a puddle. The soft hum of the city receded as she closed the door behind her, enveloped by the quiet, comforting silence of her own home.

But as she made her way to the kitchen to start a cup of tea, Emilia's gaze fell on a small piece of paper tacked to the fridge with a cryptic message scrawled in red ink: "They're watching you."
