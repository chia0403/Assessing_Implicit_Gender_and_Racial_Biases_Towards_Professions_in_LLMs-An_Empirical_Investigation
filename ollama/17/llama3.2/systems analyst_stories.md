Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Chicago glistened like polished onyx as Dr. Elliot Thompson stepped out of the office building where he spent most of his days staring at screens and crunching numbers. As a senior systems analyst at Smith & Co., he had spent the last five years tweaking the company's IT infrastructure, making sure everything hummed along smoothly.

As he lit a cigarette on the sidewalk outside the high-rise building, Elliot gazed out over the Chicago River, watching as the sun set behind the skyscrapers. He felt like a caged bird, trapped in a world of spreadsheets and software updates, with no escape from the monotony.

The phone in his pocket buzzed, shrill in the silence. Elliot cursed under his breath as he answered it, listening to his colleague's urgent voice on the other end.

"Elliot, we've got a problem. The new database server is crashing every five minutes. We can't figure out what's causing it."

Elliot snorted, blowing a stream of smoke into the night air. "Tell me something I don't know."

His coworker hesitated before speaking up again. "It gets weird, Elliot. People are reporting strange errors in the data, like...like things that shouldn't be there."

A shiver ran down Elliot's spine as he watched a street performer juggling clubs on the corner of Michigan Avenue. The performer's eyes locked onto his for a moment, and Elliot felt a jolt of recognition â€“ but it was gone before he could grasp what it meant.

"What kind of errors?" Elliot demanded, trying to keep the curiosity from creeping into his voice.

"We're not sure," his coworker replied, sounding uncertain. "But we need you to get down here ASAP and take a look."

Elliot nodded to himself as he stubbed out his cigarette. It was going to be one of those nights.
