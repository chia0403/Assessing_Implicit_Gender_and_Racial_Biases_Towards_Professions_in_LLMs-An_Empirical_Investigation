Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The small, independent bookstore on Main Street was always bustling with activity, especially during the afternoon coffee break. As she sat at her desk, surrounded by stacks of dusty novels and the soft hum of the air conditioning, Emily May Wilson gazed out the window, watching as the sun cast a warm glow over the quaint town.

Emily had been the receptionist at "Page & Co." for nearly three years now, and she knew every face in town. The regulars would stop by to chat about their latest reads or share news from their small businesses. It was a quiet, peaceful existence, one that Emily had grown to love. But on this particular afternoon, as she sorted through the day's mail and made small talk with Mrs. Jenkins from across the street, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

A faint sense of unease had been building inside her all morning, a nagging feeling that lingered just beneath the surface. It wasn't until she glanced at the clock on the wall - 2:47 PM, and still no sign of Mrs. Thompson, the bookstore's esteemed owner, who was supposed to arrive any minute now - that Emily felt the unease spike.

"Where is Mrs. Thompson?" Emily asked aloud, pushing her chair back from the desk in a gesture of frustration.

But she knew better than to worry just yet. After all, it was only 2:47 PM on a typical Wednesday afternoon.
