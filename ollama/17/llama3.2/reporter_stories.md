Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle were always at their most unforgiving on Wednesdays, but for Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, the grey skies and drizzly pavement only added to the city's allure. As a reporter for the Emerald City Times, Lexi had spent countless hours navigating these very same streets in search of the next big story.

Tonight was no exception. With her trusty camera slung over one shoulder and a notebook clutched tightly in her other hand, Lexi made her way down to the waterfront, where rumors of a long-abandoned shipwreck had been circulating among locals for months. According to whispers, the vessel – a 19th-century cargo ship known as the "Maelstrom's Revenge" – had lain hidden beneath the surface of Puget Sound for decades, its secrets waiting to be uncovered.

Lexi had always been drawn to stories like this one: mysteries that spanned generations, legends that refused to die. And tonight, she was determined to uncover the truth behind the Maelstrom's Revenge, no matter what it took.

As she approached the dock, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched – not just by the faint lights of the nearby warehouses and apartments, but by something far more sinister lurking in the shadows. The rain seemed to grow heavier, drumming against her skin like a thousand tiny fingers, as if the city itself was warning her away from this particular path.

But Lexi Thompson was no stranger to danger. With a fierce glint in her eye and a smile that could charm the feathers off a startled seagull, she stepped forward into the darkness, ready to face whatever secrets – or terrors – lay hidden beneath the waves.
