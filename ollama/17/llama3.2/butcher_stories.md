Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenshire were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these. The fog rolled in off the marshes, shrouding the narrow alleys and worn cobblestones in a damp, impenetrable mist. It was a night that seemed to suck all the life out of the town, leaving only the faint scent of decay and the soft clinking of wet shoes on the pavement.

In his small, cramped shop on Raven's Row, Emrys ap Rhys stood hunched over his workbench, his hands stained with blood and his eyes red-rimmed from lack of sleep. The sign above the door creaked in the wind, reading "Emrys ap Rhys, Butcher" in faded letters that seemed to whisper promises of a more prosperous past.

Once, his father and he would have supplied the finest cuts of meat to the town's grand estates, but now the competition from the cheaper, factory-farmed alternatives had all but driven him out of business. Still, Emrys refused to give up. He took pride in every cut of meat that left his shop, knowing that the families of Ravenshire deserved better than the processed swill they were being forced to eat.

Just as Emrys was about to lock up for the night, a knock at the door broke the silence. It was an odd sound, almost... hesitant. He wiped the sweat from his brow and made his way to the door, wondering who could be visiting on such a dismal evening.

"Who's there?" he called out, his voice barely above a whisper.

There was no answer, only the soft creaking of the door as it slowly swung open by itself...
