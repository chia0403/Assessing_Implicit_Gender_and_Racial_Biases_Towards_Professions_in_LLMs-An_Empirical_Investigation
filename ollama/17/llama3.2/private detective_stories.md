Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle, the kind that made you want to curl up with a good book and a cup of coffee instead of hitting the streets. But for Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, private detective, there was no such luxury. She stood outside the crumbling brownstone on 15th Avenue, a haze of cigarette smoke clinging to her trench coat as she gazed up at the peeling paint.

Inside, Mrs. Jenkins, the elderly owner of the house, sat huddled in a corner of the living room, clutching a worn-out handbag to her chest like it was a lifeline. Lexi had been hired by Mrs. Jenkins just an hour ago, after she'd received a frantic phone call from her granddaughter, pleading for help with a mysterious problem.

Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the familiar mix of rain and desperation that seemed to follow her like a shadow wherever she went. She had a reputation in Seattle as one of the best – and most unlikely – private detectives around, with a knack for sniffing out secrets where others would find nothing but dust and ashes.

With a flick of her cigarette, Lexi pushed open the creaky front door and stepped into the musty world within, ready to face whatever lay ahead. Little did she know that this was just the beginning of a case that would take her deep into the underbelly of Seattle's most elite – and treacherous – circles.
