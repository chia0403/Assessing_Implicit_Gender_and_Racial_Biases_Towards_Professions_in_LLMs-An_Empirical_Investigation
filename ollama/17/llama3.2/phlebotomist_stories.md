Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights above the hospital's blood bank hummed like a chorus of restless bees as Phoebe Alexandra "Phoebe" Thompson carefully lifted the arm of the waiting patient, Mrs. Jenkins, onto the examination table. It was a typical Monday morning at Mercy Hospital, with the sound of beeping machines and hushed conversations filling the air. The smell of disinfectant and stale coffee wafted through the narrow corridors, mingling with the scent of antiseptic that clung to Phoebe's scrubs.

As a phlebotomist, Phoebe had spent countless hours in this very bank, extracting blood samples from patients for lab tests and treatments. She knew every nook and cranny, every quirk of the machines and every trick of the trade. But on days like today, when the morning rush threatened to overwhelm her, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Phoebe glanced at the clock above the bank's entrance – 8:47 AM – and wondered if Mrs. Jenkins' blood test results would be ready by now. The elderly woman had been in for what felt like an eternity, and Phoebe was starting to worry about her. As she expertly threaded the needle and attached the venipuncture catheter, a shiver ran down Phoebe's spine, leaving her with a sense of foreboding that lingered long after the test was complete.
