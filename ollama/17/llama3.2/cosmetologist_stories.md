Here's a potential story opening:

The dim fluorescent lights above the worn vinyl booths cast an eerie glow over the small, cramped salon on 5th Street. It was a place where time seemed to stand still, where the worries of the outside world were left at the door and all that mattered was the art of transformation.

Aurora "Rory" Wystan, a talented cosmetologist with a passion for creating works of art from hair and makeup, worked tirelessly behind the chair. Her eyes scanned the reflection in the mirror as she expertly twisted and coiled her client's dark locks into a stunning updo. The scent of warm honey and vanilla wafted through the air, mingling with the hum of conversation from the other patrons.

As Rory finished the final touches on her latest design, the door swung open, admitting a blast of cool air and the faint sound of raindrops pattering against the pavement outside. A young woman, shivering beneath a soggy denim jacket, slipped into the booth beside Rory's client. Her eyes scanned the salon, searching for someone â€“ or something.

And that was when everything changed.
