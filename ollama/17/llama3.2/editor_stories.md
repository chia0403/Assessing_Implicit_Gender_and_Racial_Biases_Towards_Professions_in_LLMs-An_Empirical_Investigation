The rain poured down on the streets of Ashwood, casting a gloomy mist over the already worn-down facades of the old town's buildings. The smell of damp earth and decay filled the air as Emilia Rose Winters stepped out of her small apartment and onto the wet pavement. She pulled up the hood of her waterproof jacket, blowing a strand of dark hair out of her face as she checked her watch for what felt like the hundredth time that morning.

As she pushed open the door and stepped inside, a bell above it rang out, and Emilia's eyes scanned the empty office for any signs of her colleagues. The silence was oppressive, and for a moment, Emilia wondered if anyone was even working today...
