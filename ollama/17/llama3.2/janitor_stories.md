Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights of the old library hummed overhead, casting an eerie glow over the dusty shelves that stretched all the way to the ceiling. In the midst of this musty silence, Janitorial Specialist Arthur Everett Jenkins trudged through the aisles on his worn-out sneakers, pushing his cart filled with discarded books and broken chairs.

Arthur, or AJ as he was known to the regulars, had been keeping the library running for over a decade. He knew every nook and cranny, every creaky floorboard, and every forgotten corner. But despite his familiarity with the space, Arthur felt like an outsider in this place of quiet reverence.

As he worked, AJ's mind wandered to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the library lately. Books would go missing, only to reappear days later with no signs of wear or tear. The sound of whispers seemed to emanate from nowhere and everywhere at once, making it impossible for him to concentrate on his work.

AJ sighed, wiping the sweat from his forehead with a dirty rag. It was just another day in the life of a janitor, but as he looked around at the rows upon rows of silent tomes, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss - and that he might be the only one who noticed.

Would you like me to continue with the story or is there anything else I can help you with?
