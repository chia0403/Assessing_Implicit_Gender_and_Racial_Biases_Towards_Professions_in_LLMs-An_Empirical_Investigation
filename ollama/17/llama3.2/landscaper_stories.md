Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was just starting to set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the neatly manicured lawns and blooming gardens that lined the streets. In a small truck with a faded logo reading "Green Thumb Landscaping" emblazoned on the side, landscaper Julian Alexander "Jules" Thompson made his way down Elm Street, pushing a wheelbarrow loaded with freshly dug plants and mulch.

As he worked, Jules couldn't help but feel a sense of satisfaction at the work he did. He loved being outdoors, surrounded by nature and the sounds of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the breeze. It was a feeling that had stayed with him even after years of working as a landscaper, when his hands were no longer steady from exhaustion and his back wasn't as spry.

Jules's thoughts, however, weren't on the task at hand. His mind kept drifting to the strange letter he'd received earlier that day, addressed to him by name but with no return address or indication of who might have sent it. The words "We know what you did" had been scrawled across the page in bold black letters, making Jules's skin crawl and his gut twist into knots.

As he rounded a bend on Elm Street, Jules spotted a small cottage nestled among the trees - Mrs. Jenkins' house, where he'd worked for years to keep her garden looking its best. The woman who lived there was known in town as the most fiercely protective of her property, and Jules couldn't help but wonder what she might make of the ominous message that had landed on his doorstep.

Jules's eyes narrowed as he pulled up to Mrs. Jenkins' house. He knew one thing for sure: this wasn't the kind of trouble he needed right now.
