As the last wisps of sunlight faded behind the worn brick facades of Willow Creek's Main Street, Aurora "Rory" Wynter began her daily ritual of transformation. Aged 25, Rory was the proprietor and resident genius behind "Locks & Luxe," a small but vibrant salon nestled between a vintage clothing boutique and a used bookstore.

On this particular autumn evening, the air clung to the streets like a damp shroud, carrying the whispers of long-forgotten secrets and lingering scents from the nearby bakery. The scent of freshly baked pastries wafted through the open door of Locks & Luxe, mingling with the rich aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the hum of chatty regulars.

As Rory expertly wrapped her hair around a towel to shield it from the evening's approaching chill, she mentally prepared for another long night of listening to her clients' deepest confessions, watching as their eyes sparkled behind layers of carefully crafted makeup, or simply enjoying the simple pleasure of helping someone feel like their best self. Little did Rory know, tonight would bring a new face to the salon, one who would disrupt the tranquility of Willow Creek's small-town life and send shivers down her own spine.
