Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the Parisian sky, casting a golden glow over the City of Light, Aurélien Dumont slipped into his uniform, adjusting his tie with precision. A concierge at the prestigious Hôtel de la Paix since 2015, Aurélien had seen it all - the romantic proposals, the family reunions, and the countless late-night room service requests for everything from croissants to champagne.

Tonight was no exception. As he locked up the lobby door behind him, Aurélien noticed a figure lingering by the grand piano in the foyer. The woman's hair was a rich, dark brown, and her eyes sparkled like diamonds as she listened intently to Chopin's Nocturne in E-flat major. She seemed out of place among the hotel's usual clientele - the businessman on his way home from a long day at the office, or the young couple celebrating their anniversary.

Aurélien's curiosity was piqued. Who was this mysterious woman, and what brought her to Hôtel de la Paix on such an ordinary Tuesday evening? He made a mental note to introduce himself when she left, and perhaps - just perhaps - he could uncover the story behind her enchanting presence.

As the final notes of the nocturne faded away, Aurélien's gaze met the woman's, and for a fleeting moment, they shared a connection that went beyond mere acquaintanceship. It was as if the universe had brought them together, and now it was up to Aurélien to uncover the secrets she kept hidden behind those captivating eyes.

The lobby fell silent once more, but Aurélien knew that this chance encounter would change everything - for him, at least. Little did he know, this ordinary Tuesday evening would set off a chain of events that would take him on a journey into the heart of Paris's most intricate mysteries.
