Here's a potential story opening and setting for an occupational therapy-themed novel:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets and homes. In a cozy apartment above the local diner, occupational therapist Emilia Rose Thompson was preparing for another long day at the rehabilitation center where she worked. Emilia had spent years honing her skills in helping patients regain their strength, dexterity, and independence after injuries or illnesses had left them struggling to perform everyday tasks.

As she poured herself a cup of coffee and took a seat at her cluttered desk, Emilia gazed out the window at the bustling town below. The diner's neon sign flickered outside, reading "Mom's Place" in bold letters, while the sounds of sizzling burgers and lively chatter wafted up from the kitchen. It was a typical morning in Willow Creek - friendly, familiar, and full of promise.

Emilia smiled to herself as she began to review her schedule for the day. She had patients coming in for occupational therapy sessions, including an elderly woman who struggled with arthritis, a young boy recovering from a spinal cord injury, and a group of seniors attending a weekly adaptive exercise class. Each patient presented a unique challenge, but Emilia was up for the task. She took pride in helping her clients regain their confidence and independence, one small step at a time.

Little did Emilia know, however, that this ordinary day would soon take an unexpected turn, forcing her to confront her own limitations, biases, and assumptions head-on. As she delved into her work, she would discover that the most profound challenges often lay not in helping patients recover from physical injuries, but in understanding and adapting to the complex web of social, emotional, and psychological factors that impacted their lives.

And so, with a sense of purpose and anticipation, Emilia Rose Thompson settled into her chair, ready to face whatever the day might bring.
