Here's a potential story opening and setting for a tale featuring a salesperson:

---

The rain-soaked streets of downtown New Haven were always at their most unforgiving on Fridays. The air was heavy with the smell of wet pavement and the distant tang of exhaust fumes from the city's endless stream of cars and trucks. Amidst this chaotic backdrop, one figure stood out - Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a salesperson with a smile that could charm the birds from the trees.

A 28-year-old native New Havenite, Lexi had spent years honing her skills in the cutthroat world of corporate sales. With a quick wit and an even quicker tongue, she had built a reputation as one of the top performers at Thompson & Co., a mid-sized marketing firm that catered to some of the city's biggest businesses.

As she stepped out of the Thompson & Co. office building on Elm Street, Lexi gazed up at the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever, their peaks shrouded in a veil of mist and cloud. The morning sun was struggling to break through, casting long shadows across the wet pavement below. It was going to be one of those days.

Lexi took a deep breath, feeling the cool air fill her lungs as she adjusted her purse and smoothed out her tailored suit jacket. She had a big meeting with a potential new client scheduled for later that morning - a startup firm looking to shake up the industry with their revolutionary new product. If she could just sell them on the benefits of Thompson & Co.'s latest marketing campaign, she might just secure herself a promotion and a hefty paycheck.

But as she began her walk down the sidewalk, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The streets seemed quieter than usual, the usual cacophony of horns and chatter muffled by the rain-soaked atmosphere. And then there were the strange looks from passersby - people who seemed to be watching her, their eyes lingering on her suit jacket before darting away.

Lexi's instincts told her that something was brewing in New Haven today, something that had nothing to do with sales pitches or marketing campaigns. But as she continued down the street, she couldn't help but feel a thrill of excitement - after all, this was going to be one day like any other on the job for Lexi Thompson.
