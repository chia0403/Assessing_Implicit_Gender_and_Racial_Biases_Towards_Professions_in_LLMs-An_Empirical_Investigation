Here's a potential story opening:

Detective Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her cruiser and onto the misty streets of Ravenswood, the small town in the Pacific Northwest where she had grown up. The rain-soaked night air clung to her like a damp shroud, but Lexi hardly noticed as she gazed up at the old Victorian mansion looming above the sidewalk.

The house was a relic of Ravenswood's once-grand past, its turrets and gargoyles reaching towards the sky like skeletal fingers. It had been the home of the wealthy and reclusive industrialist, Henry Blackstone, who had made his fortune in the timber industry decades ago. Rumors swirled that Blackstone's family was cursed, and the mansion had a reputation for being one of the most haunted places in town.

Lexi's eyes narrowed as she surveyed the scene before her. The Blackstone estate had been the site of a mysterious fire earlier that night, and the Ravenswood PD had received a frantic call from a neighbor claiming to have seen someone lurking around the mansion. As Lexi began to process the scene, she couldn't shake the feeling that this was going to be a long night.

With her gaze scanning the darkness, Lexi's mind wandered back to the cryptic message she'd received earlier that evening: "The fire is just the beginning."
