Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Story Opening**

As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the horizon, Captain Ryder Alexander Thompson banked the Cessna 172 Skyhawk to the left, its tires scorching the dry earth as it descended into the dusty airstrip. The twin engines roared in protest, their pitch dropping slightly as they fought against the headwind. Ryder's eyes locked onto the runway, his mind racing with the events of the past few days.

**Setting**

The small airfield, aptly named "Red Rock," lay nestled in the heart of Arizona's desert landscape like a forgotten relic from another era. The sun-scorched terrain stretched out for miles in every direction, punctuated only by the occasional rocky outcropping or scrubby mesquite tree. Ryder had flown into Red Rock countless times before, always feeling a sense of nostalgia wash over him as he descended onto the rough, unpaved surface.

The airfield itself was small, with only three buildings: a weathered hangar, a crumbling terminal building that seemed to lean precariously against its neighbor, and a long, narrow fuel tank that hummed quietly in the background. It was a place where time moved slowly, where the only sound was the wind rustling through the cacti and the occasional rumble of thunder on hot summer days.

Ryder's eyes scanned the horizon as he taxied towards his hangar, his mind still reeling from the strange occurrences that had been plaguing him for weeks. He'd flown cargo shipments across the country, transporting goods from one end of the nation to the other, but something was off. Equipment would malfunction, navigation systems would fail, and the occasional passenger would vanish in mid-air.

Ryder's gut told him it was more than just a coincidence. And now, as he shut down the engines and climbed out of the cockpit, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.
