Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Dr. Maya Jensen hurried down the sidewalk, her stethoscope clutched in one hand and a worn leather bag slung over her shoulder. As an ER resident at Harborview Medical Center, Maya was no stranger to chaos, but tonight felt different - the hospital's fluorescent lights seemed to hum with an extra layer of tension, as if the very fabric of reality was about to unravel.

Maya had just finished a long shift in the trauma bay, where she'd witnessed her fair share of gruesome injuries and life-or-death dilemmas. Now, she was on her way to meet a colleague at the hospital's rooftop bar for a well-deserved whiskey-fueled debrief. As she pushed through the revolving door, the cool night air enveloped her like a shroud, carrying with it the scent of wet earth and possibility.

Little did Maya know, tonight would be one of those nights that would test her skills to the limit - a night that would push her compassion, expertise, and very humanity to the breaking point.

Setting: Seattle, Washington

Timeframe: Late evening, around 10 PM on a rainy autumn night.
