Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emily Elizabeth Thompson stepped out of her small office in the quaint town of Willow Creek, taking a deep breath of the crisp morning air as she gazed up at the misty mountains rising above the valley below. As a counseling psychologist with a private practice specializing in grief counseling and trauma recovery, Emily had seen her fair share of dark days and troubled souls. But there was something about this particular morning that felt different - perhaps it was the lingering sense of unease in the pit of her stomach, or the feeling that she was being watched from the shadows.

Emily had always loved Willow Creek, with its tight-knit community and scenic beauty. She had grown up here, raised by her parents in a cozy little house on Elm Street, where the smell of fresh-cut grass and baking cookies still transported her back to happier times. But as she walked down the main street, lined with shops and restaurants that seemed frozen in time, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The town's usual warmth and welcome seemed tempered by a sense of foreboding, like the storm clouds gathering on the horizon.

As she turned onto her street, Emily noticed a piece of paper stuck under her office door. She pulled it out, her heart sinking as she saw the familiar logo of the Willow Creek Sheriff's Department. A note was scrawled on the back in hasty handwriting: "Dr. Thompson, we need to talk. -J."
