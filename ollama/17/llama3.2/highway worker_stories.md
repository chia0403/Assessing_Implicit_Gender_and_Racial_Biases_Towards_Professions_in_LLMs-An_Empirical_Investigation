Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the vast expanse of Route 17, casting a golden glow over the cracked asphalt and litter-strewn median. Highway worker Ryder Everett Jenkins rubbed the fatigue from his eyes as he surveyed the stretch of road before him, his worn denim jacket flapping in the gentle breeze. It had been another long day on the job, with the scorching summer heat draining the life from his bones. As he scanned the horizon, Ryder's mind wandered to the stack of unpaid bills waiting for him at home, a constant reminder that this grueling life of traveling from town to town in search of decent work was taking its toll.

Ryder had grown up on the open road, the son of a truck driver who'd taught him everything he knew about the highway system and how to fix just about anything that broke. He'd always dreamed of settling down, finding a quiet spot to put down roots and watch his kids grow up in a small town, but life had other plans. A string of dead-end jobs and failed relationships had left Ryder with nothing but the worn denim jacket he'd inherited from his father and the endless miles of highway stretching out before him.

As he stood there, lost in thought, Ryder's earpiece crackled to life, breaking the spell. "Ryder, we got a problem at mile marker 23," came the voice on the other end, a gruff but familiar sound that signaled trouble was brewing. Ryder's heart quickened as he set off towards the source of the distress call, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead in the darkening light of day.
