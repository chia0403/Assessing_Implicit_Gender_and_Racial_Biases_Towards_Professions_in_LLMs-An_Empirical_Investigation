Here's a potential story opening:

The neon sign creaked in the gentle ocean breeze, casting a gaudy glow over the small town of Tidal Cove. Inside the local watering hole, McGillicuddy's Pub & Grill, the sounds of sea shanties and laughter filled the air as bartender extraordinaire, Asher Flynn McGillicuddy, expertly mixed drinks with a flourish.

Asher, a 28-year-old Tidal Cove native with piercing blue eyes and jet-black hair, had spent years honing his craft behind the bar. He knew everyone's drink of choice by heart, from the rum-soaked fishermen to the young tourists looking for a taste of the local scene. But on this particular Friday evening, Asher felt a sense of unease wash over him as he polished a mug with a white apron and surveyed the crowd.

A group of rough-looking strangers had just walked in, their eyes scanning the room with an air of desperation that made Asher's instincts twitch. He couldn't quite put his finger on it, but something about them didn't feel right. As he poured a pint for the newcomer nearest to him, he caught the eye of the mysterious stranger and felt a shiver run down his spine.

Little did Asher know, this was just the beginning of a night that would change everything in Tidal Cove forever.
