Rain lashed against the windowpane of Eloise Ainsworth's tiny office, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously in the window. The familiar scent of chamomile tea and turmeric lingered in the air, fighting a losing battle against the damp chill seeping through the cracks in the old building.

Eloise herself, perched on a stool behind her cluttered desk, was a picture of controlled chaos. Her fiery red hair was pulled back in a loose bun, escaping tendrils framing freckled cheeks and emerald green eyes that shone with both weariness and unwavering determination. Papers overflowed from folders, each one representing another client grappling with dietary demons, while half-eaten bowls of quinoa salad dotted the desk â€“ a testament to her own commitment to healthy living.

Today, however, Eloise's usual calm was replaced by a gnawing anxiety. A knock on the door, barely audible over the storm's crescendo, made her jump. This wasn't just any client. This was Mrs. Evelyn Davenport, the formidable matriarch of the Davenport family, renowned for their sprawling wealth and even more sprawling reputation for extravagance. Eloise had been summoned to untangle the dietary knots of Evelyn's ailing son, Alistair, a task that felt as daunting as climbing Everest in stilettos.
