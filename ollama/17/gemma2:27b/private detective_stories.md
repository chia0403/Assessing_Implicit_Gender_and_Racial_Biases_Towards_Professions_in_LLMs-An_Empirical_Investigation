Rain hammered against the warped glass pane of Alistair Finch's office window, blurring the neon glow of the 'Lucky Dragon' sign across the street. The air hung thick with cigar smoke and desperation, punctuated by the insistent tick-tock of a grandfather clock in the corner â€“ a relic from a time when Alistair actually believed in second chances. 

Alistair himself, slumped deep into his threadbare leather armchair, was a man worn down by years of chasing shadows and secrets in the labyrinthine alleys of New Orleans. His face, etched with wrinkles deeper than the Mississippi itself, bore the weariness of a thousand sleepless nights spent grappling with the city's underbelly. He idly swirled the amber liquid in his glass, bourbon barely masking the bitter tang of disappointment that clung to him like stale cigarette smoke. 

The door creaked open, momentarily disrupting the melancholic symphony of rain and regret. A woman stood framed in the doorway, her silhouette obscured by the dim light spilling from the hallway. Alistair sighed, bracing himself for whatever new torment fate had thrown his way. "Come in," he rasped, his voice gravelly from years of chain-smoking and cheap whiskey.  "Don't just stand there soaking up my misery."
