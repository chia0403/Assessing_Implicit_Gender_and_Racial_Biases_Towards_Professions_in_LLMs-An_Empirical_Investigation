Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Amelia Cartwright's third-grade classroom, mimicking the drumming anxiety in her chest.  The old oak tree outside, its branches gnarled like arthritic fingers, scraped against the windowpane with unsettling intensity.  Amelia glanced at the clock – 3:15 p.m. – just fifteen minutes until dismissal, and the storm showed no signs of letting up.

Her classroom, usually a haven of colorful posters and boisterous creativity, felt strangely oppressive today. The scent of damp earth and ozone lingered in the air, making her head throb.  Outside, the wind howled like a hungry wolf, sending shivers down Amelia's spine. A knot of worry tightened in her stomach; with roads likely flooded and parents stuck at work due to the storm, what was she going to do with twenty restless third-graders?

This wasn't how she envisioned ending her Friday afternoon.
