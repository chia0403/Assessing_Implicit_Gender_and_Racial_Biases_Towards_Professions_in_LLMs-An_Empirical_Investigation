Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's small veterinary clinic, blurring the neon sign that read "Pawsitive Care" into an impressionistic swirl of pink and green. Inside, the air was thick with the comforting smells of antiseptic and animal fur. A ginger tabby cat named Marmalade was nestled on a warm towel in the corner, purring contentedly despite the storm raging outside. Evelyn sighed, her gaze lingering on the creature's relaxed form. She envied Marmalade's serenity; her own nerves were frayed.

The phone had been ringing incessantly since dawn - panicked calls about flooded barns, lost pets, and injured wildlife swept up in the deluge. It was the kind of day that tested even the most seasoned vet, and Evelyn, while experienced, wasn't sure she was ready for whatever chaos the storm might bring next.  

Just then, a frantic pounding on the door startled her. Marmalade lifted his head, ears perked, his green eyes wide with alarm. Taking a deep breath to steady herself, Evelyn crossed the room and swung open the door.
