Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Eleanor Cartwright's cozy office, blurring the vibrant cityscape beyond into an impressionist painting. The aroma of cinnamon and nutmeg wafted from the teapot on her desk, a comforting counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Eleanor herself was a whirlwind of nervous energy, pacing back and forth, phone pressed to her ear.

The young woman's optimism in the face of adversity mirrored Eleanor's own youthful idealism, a fire that had dimmed somewhat over years of navigating the bureaucracy and cynicism often found within the healthcare system.
