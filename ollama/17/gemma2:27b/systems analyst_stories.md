The flickering neon sign of the 'Lucky Dragon' cast an unsettling green glow across Eleanor Vance's face as she wrestled with her overflowing tote bag. Rain lashed down, turning the alleyway into a slick, treacherous path. "Systems analysts don't belong in places like this," she muttered, adjusting her glasses that perpetually threatened to slide down her nose.

Inside the dimly lit establishment, the air hung heavy with cigarette smoke and the murmur of Cantonese conversation. Eleanor scanned the room, searching for the contact who'd promised vital information about a system breach threatening a major pharmaceutical company. Her client, a notoriously tight-lipped CEO, had insisted on this clandestine meeting, promising anonymity and a hefty bonus if she could uncover the source of the attack.

Eleanor nervously smoothed down her sensible cardigan, acutely aware of being the only one in the room not sporting tattoos or leather jackets. This was far outside her comfort zone - usually, her world revolved around lines of code and data analysis, not shadowy backroom deals. But this case was different. The potential fallout from the breach could be devastating, impacting millions reliant on life-saving medication. Eleanor had a responsibility to unravel the mystery, even if it meant venturing into the murky depths of Hong Kong's underworld.
