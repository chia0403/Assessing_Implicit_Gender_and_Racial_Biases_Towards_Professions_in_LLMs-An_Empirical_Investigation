The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth as Silas Blackwood wrestled a gnarled spruce trunk onto his sawhorse.  Sunlight, filtered through the dense canopy of ancient firs, dappled the forest floor in shifting patterns. Birdsong echoed through the silent giants, a melody punctuated by the rhythmic whine of Silas's chainsaw. He wiped sweat from his brow, the grit of sawdust mixing with the grime already ingrained in his skin. This was his world: the hushed cathedral of towering pines, the earthy scent that clung to everything, the satisfying crunch of wood under his boots.

Silas wasn't a man who enjoyed the company of others. The solitude of the forest suited him just fine. He found solace in the rhythm of his work, the physicality of it grounding him. Yet, today, something felt different. A prickling unease crept along his spine, an unsettling awareness that he was being watched.
