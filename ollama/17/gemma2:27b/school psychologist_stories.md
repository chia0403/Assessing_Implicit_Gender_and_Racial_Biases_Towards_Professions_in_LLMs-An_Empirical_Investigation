Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her. It was a Thursday, the kind that seemed to stretch on forever, filled with meetings and paperwork that threatened to drown her in bureaucracy. She sighed, pushing aside the stack of student evaluations, each file representing another young mind grappling with anxieties she couldn't always untangle.

But today, the school felt oppressive, the air thick with an unspoken tension she couldn't quite place. 


Eleanor glanced at the clock â€“ 2:45 pm. The final bell would ring soon, unleashing a wave of restless teenagers onto the already soggy streets.  She hoped she wouldn't be needed for another crisis before then. But deep down, a nagging feeling told her the day was far from over.
