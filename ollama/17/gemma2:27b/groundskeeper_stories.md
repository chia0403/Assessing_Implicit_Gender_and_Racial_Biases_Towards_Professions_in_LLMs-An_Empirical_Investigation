The first tendrils of dawn were just beginning to lick over the horizon, painting the sky in hues of lavender and apricot as Elias Hawthorne knelt amongst his roses. Dew sparkled on the velvety petals, each one a miniature jewel reflecting the nascent light. Elias hummed softly, a melody passed down from his grandmother, his nimble fingers delicately pruning away dead blooms. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and blooming jasmine, a symphony for the senses that only he seemed to appreciate in the hushed stillness of dawn.

The grand Victorian manor loomed behind him, its silhouette stark against the burgeoning light. ivy clung to its aged brickwork like ghostly fingers, and the once vibrant paint was now faded and peeling. It was a beautiful ruin, whispered Elias to himself, a testament to bygone grandeur. He'd been tending these grounds for nearly twenty years, long enough to know every twist of the ancient oak, every hidden nook in the overgrown rose garden. But lately, something felt different. A sense of anticipation, an almost tangible shift in the air.
