The air hung thick with the scent of garlic, oregano, and simmering tomato sauce. It clung to Emilia Rossi's apron like a second skin, a familiar aroma that had become both comforting and suffocating over her three years working at Enzo's Trattoria. Tonight, however, the smell was tinged with something else â€“ a sharp metallic tang that made her stomach clench.

It wasn't unusual for Enzo's to be bustling on a Friday night. Families crammed into booths, boisterous groups filled the long communal tables, and couples huddled in dimly lit corners, sharing plates of steaming pasta and glasses of ruby-red wine. But tonight, there was a palpable tension thrumming through the restaurant, a discordant note amidst the usual convivial hum. Emilia chalked it up to the storm raging outside, rain lashing against the windows like angry fists.

The flickering neon sign outside cast an eerie glow on the street slick with rainwater, reflecting the flashing red and blue lights that had just pulled up across the street. Emilia glanced at Enzo, her burly boss with a perpetually furrowed brow and hands stained crimson from years of kneading dough. He stood frozen by the window, his gaze fixed on the arriving police car.

Something was wrong. Very wrong.
