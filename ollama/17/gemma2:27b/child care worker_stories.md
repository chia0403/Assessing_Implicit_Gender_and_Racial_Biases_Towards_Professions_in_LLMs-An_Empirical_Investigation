The pungent aroma of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of crayons and the faint tang of overripe bananas from yesterday's snack. Amelia Cartwright grimaced as she scrubbed another sticky handprint off the play kitchen counter. It was only 9:30 am, and already her day felt like it had been running on overdrive for hours.

She glanced across the brightly coloured room at the gaggle of toddlers playing with building blocks. Little Liam was determinedly trying to stack them into a precarious tower, while Maya giggled uncontrollably as she toppled his creation with a single swipe of her chubby hand. Amelia smiled, despite the exhaustion gnawing at her. This was why she loved her job; these tiny humans, bursting with energy and unfiltered joy, had a way of melting away even the toughest frustrations.

But today felt different. A strange unease prickled at the back of Amelia's neck. It started subtly: the unusually quiet morning routine, the flickering lights in the hallway, the faint metallic smell that lingered beneath the disinfectant. Something was off. And as she watched Liam stumble and fall with a soft thud, her intuition screamed: this wasnâ€™t just an ordinary day at Sunnyside Daycare.
