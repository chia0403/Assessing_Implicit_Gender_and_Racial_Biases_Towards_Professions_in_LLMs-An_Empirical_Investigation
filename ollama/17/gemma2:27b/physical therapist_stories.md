Rain lashed against the windows of the "Healing Hands" clinic, blurring the view of the vibrant autumn foliage outside. The air inside was thick with the scent of lavender and disinfectant, a strange but oddly comforting combination. Amelia Winthrop, her auburn braid snaking down her back, adjusted the weight on a patient's ankle, her brow furrowed in concentration.  

"Just a little further," she encouraged softly, her voice tinged with the gentle lilt of her New England upbringing. "You're doing great, Sarah."

Amelia was known for her unwavering patience and empathy, traits that made her an exceptional physical therapist. Yet, beneath the calm exterior, a shadow lingered.  She hadn't expected to find herself back in her hometown after years of building a successful practice in Boston. But life had a way of throwing curveballs, forcing you to re-evaluate your path. Now, Amelia was facing down her own demons while helping others reclaim their physical strength. 

But something else was stirring in the air, a tension Amelia couldn't quite place. It started with whispered rumors among patients, stories of strange occurrences and unexplained injuries. And then there were the dreams... vivid, unsettling visions that haunted her sleep.

Amelia had always been a pragmatist, dismissing superstition as mere folklore. But as the days grew shorter and the wind howled louder outside, she began to question everything she thought she knew.  Could there be something more sinister lurking beneath the surface of this seemingly idyllic town?
