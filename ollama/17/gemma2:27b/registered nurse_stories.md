Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, blurring the neon glow of the city beyond. The wind howled like a banshee down the chimney flue, rattling the old building's bones. Inside the ER, however, a different kind of storm raged. 

Eleanor Grace Thornton, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun and the faint scent of antiseptic clinging to her scrubs, fought against the tide of patients. A gurney with a young boy suffering from asthma wheezed past, followed by an elderly woman clutching her chest and muttering about heartburn. Eleanor, her face etched with fatigue but her hazel eyes sharp and focused, navigated the chaos with practiced ease. Tonight, St. Jude's was a crucible, testing the mettle of its staff.
