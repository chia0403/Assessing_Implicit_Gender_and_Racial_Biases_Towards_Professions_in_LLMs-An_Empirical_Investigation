Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear as she stared at the overflowing in-tray on her desk. It was Tuesday night, and everyone else in the office had long since gone home. Bea, however, was stuck wrestling with a particularly thorny insurance claim â€“ a stolen antique vase valued at more than the policy holder's entire annual salary.  

Bea wasn't just any insurance agent. She had a nose for sniffing out fraud, an uncanny ability to decipher the subtle discrepancies in people's stories. It was this talent that had landed her in the dimly lit office of "Hawthorne & Sons Insurance," inheriting the family business after her father's untimely passing. But tonight, even Bea's sharp instincts seemed dulled by the persistent drizzle and the gnawing loneliness that always crept up on Tuesdays.
