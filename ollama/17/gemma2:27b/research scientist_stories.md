The sterile white walls of Dr. Eleanor Vance's lab hummed with the quiet thrum of machinery. Pipettes clicked, centrifuges whirred, and the faint scent of formaldehyde lingered in the air. Outside, the Colorado Rockies were cloaked in a blanket of fresh snow, but inside, Eleanor was lost in a world of microscopic wonders. 

A digital microscope displayed an intricate web of branching fungal hyphae on her screen. They pulsed with an otherworldly luminescence, the result of genetic manipulation she'd painstakingly perfected over the last decade. This wasn't just any fungus; it held the key to breaking down plastic waste at an unprecedented rate, a potential solution to the global pollution crisis that haunted Eleanor's dreams. 

But tonight, something was different. The luminescence flickered erratically, and the hyphae pulsed with unnatural speed. A shiver ran down Eleanor's spine. This wasn't normal behavior. Something had changed.
