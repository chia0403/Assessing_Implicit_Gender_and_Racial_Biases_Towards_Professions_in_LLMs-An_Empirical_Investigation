The rusted antenna creaked in the wind, a skeletal finger pointing accusingly at the cloudless Nevada sky. Below, nestled amongst sun-baked rocks and scrub brush, sat Amelia "Amy" Sanchez, her forehead furrowed in concentration as she tinkered with the guts of a vintage Hallicrafters receiver.  

Heat shimmered off the cracked asphalt driveway, baking the air thick and heavy. A lone lizard darted across the parched earth, disappearing into the shadow of a weathered Joshua tree. Amy ignored the relentless sun, her focus solely on coaxing life back into the ancient radio. This wasn't just any repair; it was her last chance to hear her grandmother's voice, preserved on a decades-old tape recording.

Her workshop, a converted shipping container, hummed with the quiet whir of fans struggling against the desert heat. Tools lay scattered across her workbench - pliers, soldering irons, and a tangle of wires that looked more like modern art than functional electronics.
