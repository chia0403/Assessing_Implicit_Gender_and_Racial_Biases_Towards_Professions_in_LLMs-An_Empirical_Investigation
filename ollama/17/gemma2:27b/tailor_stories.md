The air in The Golden Needle hung thick with the scent of beeswax and lavender, punctuated by the sharp tang of iron from Elias Finch's needle as it pierced through fine silk. Sunlight streamed through the shop window, illuminating motes of dust dancing above bolts of vibrant fabric stacked high against the walls.

The weight of years sat heavy on Elias's shoulders, etched in the lines around his kind eyes and the silver threading through his once dark hair. He’d been plying his trade in Silkhaven for over four decades, earning a reputation as one of the finest tailors in the realm.
