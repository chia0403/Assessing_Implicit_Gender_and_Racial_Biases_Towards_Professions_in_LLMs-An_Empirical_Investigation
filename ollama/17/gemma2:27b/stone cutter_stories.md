The air hung thick with the scent of granite dust and sweat. Helios, god of the sun, beat down mercilessly on the quarry, turning the white stone into blinding beacons. Elias Thorne wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his forehead. He squinted at the unfinished obelisk before him, its surface still rough and uneven. 

Elias was known throughout the region for his skill as a stone cutter. His creations – from delicate tombstones to imposing columns – adorned the homes and public spaces of the nearby city. But today, he felt the weight of expectation pressing down on him like the mountain above the quarry. This obelisk wasn't just another commission; it was to be the centerpiece of the new Temple of Artemis, a project steeped in religious fervor and political ambition. 

Elias gripped his chisel tighter, the cool metal a welcome contrast against his heated palm. He could feel the eyes of his apprentices on him, eager for guidance but wary of interrupting his concentration.  The silence was broken only by the rhythmic clang of hammer against stone, a sound that had become the soundtrack to Elias's life. Today, however, it felt like a dirge – a reminder of the immense responsibility he carried.
