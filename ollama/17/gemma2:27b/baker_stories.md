The scent of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, clinging to Emilia Beatrice Cartwright's apron like a persistent ghost.  Emilia sighed, her breath fogging the cool morning air. She’d overshot the caramel again, just a smidge too long on the heat. It was a small setback, easily remedied with another batch. Still, it nagged at her, a reminder of the constant pressure she felt running "Beatrice's Bites," the tiny bakery tucked away on Lavender Lane.

Lavender Lane itself was a charming cobblestone street, lined with pastel-colored houses that seemed plucked straight from a fairytale.  But Emilia’s shop, despite its cheery yellow awning and whimsical gingerbread men sign, struggled to attract customers in this affluent neighborhood where sourdough starter cost more than Emilia's entire weekly flour budget.
