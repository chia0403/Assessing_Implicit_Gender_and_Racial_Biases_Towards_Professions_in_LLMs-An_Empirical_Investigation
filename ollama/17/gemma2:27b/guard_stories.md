The biting wind whipped across Alistair Finch's weathered face, stinging his eyes with icy needles. He hunched deeper into his threadbare cloak, pulling the collar tighter against the relentless onslaught. Above him, the moon, a sliver of pale bone in the obsidian sky, cast long, skeletal shadows from the ancient oaks that lined the cobblestone path. Alistair trudged on, his boots crunching on the frost-covered stones, each step echoing through the eerie silence of the Whispering Woods.

He was a guard, one of the last remaining protectors of the crumbling ruins that lay ahead â€“ the once majestic Abbey of Eldoria, now a haunting testament to forgotten grandeur. For years, Alistair had stood vigil against the encroaching darkness, his loyalty unshaken despite whispers of ancient curses and phantom apparitions said to haunt its crumbling halls. Tonight, however, a gnawing unease settled deep within him. The wind carried a strange disharmony, an unsettling tremor in the usual nocturnal symphony of owls hooting and wolves howling. 

Something was amiss.
