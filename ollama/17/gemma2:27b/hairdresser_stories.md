The pungent smell of bleach mingled with sweet jasmine perfume, hanging heavy in the air like a humid summer afternoon. Outside, the sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Elm Street, baking the chrome trim on Evelyn Grace Hawthorne's vintage Chevy Impala to a shimmer. Inside "Evie's Emporium," however, it was cool and alive with the buzz of conversation and the snip-snip-snip of scissors. 

Evelyn, a woman whose silver hair defied its age with bouncy curls framing her sharp blue eyes, surveyed her domain. Three clients sat under the whirring dryers, their faces illuminated by a kaleidoscope of colors reflecting off the salon's chrome fixtures.  A young man nervously tapped his foot while waiting for his trim, and Evelyn's niece, Maisie, was expertly weaving cornrows into a woman's thick black hair. 


The bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival. Evelyn turned, a smile already forming on her lips. This was going to be an interesting afternoon.
