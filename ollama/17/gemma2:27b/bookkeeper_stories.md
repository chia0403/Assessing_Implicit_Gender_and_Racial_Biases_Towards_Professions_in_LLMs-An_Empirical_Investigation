Rain lashed against the warped glass of Agnes Periwinkle's office window, blurring the already dreary view of the alleyway behind her building. The smell of mildew and wet asphalt wafted in whenever someone carelessly left the door ajar. Agnes sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair from her face as she squinted at the ledger before her. Numbers danced and twisted on the page, mocking her with their refusal to add up.

She'd been the bookkeeper for "The Rusty Quill" tavern for nearly ten years, ever since Mrs. O'Malley had taken pity on a fresh-faced girl with a knack for figures and a desperate need for employment. But lately, things had beenâ€¦off. Receipts were missing, inventory inexplicably low, and whispers of gambling debts circulated amongst the regulars like a persistent draft. Agnes suspected something was rotten in the heart of "The Rusty Quill," but uncovering it meant facing her own fears - fears she'd carefully buried beneath stacks of invoices and balance sheets.
