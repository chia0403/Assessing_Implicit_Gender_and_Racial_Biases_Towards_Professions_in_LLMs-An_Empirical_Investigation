The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and rosemary in Bartholomew "Bart" Grimbly's shop. Dawn had barely broken over the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven, but Bart was already knee-deep in cleavers and carcasses. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the sawdust-strewn floor and the gleaming array of sausages hanging from the rafters. A symphony of squelches and scrapes accompanied Bart's expert movements as he deftly broke down a side of beef, his burly arms glistening with sweat. Outside, the town was just beginning to stir - milkmaids clinking pails, blacksmiths hammering anvils, and the distant bleating of sheep drifting in on the morning breeze. But inside Grimbly's Butchery, it was already a world unto itself: one ruled by sharp blades, crimson stains, and the unspoken rituals of a centuries-old trade.
