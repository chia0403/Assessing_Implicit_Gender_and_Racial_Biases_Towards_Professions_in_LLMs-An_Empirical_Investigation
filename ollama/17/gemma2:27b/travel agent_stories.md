Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Wanderlust Travel," mirroring the tempest brewing inside Eloise Beatrice Davenport.  The shop, usually awash in warm sunlight reflecting off glossy brochures of turquoise seas and snow-capped mountains, felt suffocatingly dim. Stacks of untouched itineraries mocked her from the corner desk, each a testament to her dwindling clientele.

Eloise sighed, tracing a finger along the worn spine of a travel guide to Patagonia. Just last year, she'd booked three honeymoons there, each couple eager to explore glaciers and hike through emerald forests. Now, those adventures seemed as distant as the stars twinkling faintly behind the rainclouds. 


The aroma of freshly brewed coffee wafted from the back room, reminding her that Mrs. Henderson, her octogenarian landlady and resident caffeine aficionado, would be checking in soon. Eloise straightened a crooked stack of postcards depicting Parisian cafes and Santorini sunsets, hoping to project an air of normalcy before Mrs. Henderson's keen eyes could pierce through her fa√ßade.
