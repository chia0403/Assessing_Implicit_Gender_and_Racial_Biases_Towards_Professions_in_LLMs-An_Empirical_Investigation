Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mimicking the relentless drumming in Eloise Amelia Cartwright's chest. She smoothed her already-perfectly pressed lavender scrubs, trying to quell the tremor in her hands. Today was different.  Today wasn't just another routine blood draw in the bustling oncology ward. Today, she was facing Mr. Hawthorne â€“ a man whose name echoed through the hospital hallways like a whispered prayer, a legend for his gruff demeanor and unwavering refusal of any medical intervention beyond the absolute bare minimum.

Eloise had heard tales about him from the other nurses: how he'd growl at anyone who dared approach him with a smile, how he hoarded his precious collection of vintage comic books like they were gold doubloons, and how even the strongest doctors trembled before his steely gaze. But Eloise, despite her nerves, was determined to treat him with the same respect and compassion she offered every patient, no matter their reputation.
