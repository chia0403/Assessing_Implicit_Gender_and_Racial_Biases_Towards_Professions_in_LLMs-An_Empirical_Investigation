Rain lashed against the warped wooden windowpane of Juniper Hayes' studio, mimicking the frantic drumbeat in her chest. The flickering neon sign outside, "Juniper's Kneads & Knots," cast an eerie green glow across the cluttered room.  Her phone lay on the worn oak massage table, screen glowing with a message she couldn't bring herself to read again.

"Cancelation due to unforeseen circumstances." It was her third cancelation this week, and the hollow pit in Juniper's stomach deepened.  The rent was due tomorrow, and her meager savings were dwindling faster than the lavender oil on her shelf. 

Juniper sighed, the scent of chamomile from a recently used diffuser mixing with the metallic tang of anxiety in the air. She glanced at the dusty yoga mat in the corner, longing for simpler times when she'd envisioned opening a serene haven for weary souls. Now, it felt more like a refuge for her own anxieties than anyone else's.

Outside, thunder boomed, shaking the windowpanes as if warning her of the storm brewing within. Juniper knew she needed to do something, anything, to turn the tide.  But what?
