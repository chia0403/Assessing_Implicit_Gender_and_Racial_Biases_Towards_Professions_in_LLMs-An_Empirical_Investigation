The midday sun hammered down on Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he balanced precariously on the steep pitch of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already chaotic skyline of Chicago spreading out beneath him. The wind whipped at the loose shingles he held, threatening to send them tumbling down onto the manicured lawn below.  

Eli wasn't afraid of heights. He'd been climbing roofs since he was a kid, following in the footsteps of his grandfather who had instilled in him a respect for the craft and an almost spiritual connection to the sky. But today, something felt different. The air crackled with an unnerving energy, like a storm brewing just beyond the horizon. It wasn't just the heat. A gnawing unease settled deep in Eli's gut, making his usually sure hands tremble slightly as he hammered down another nail. 

Suddenly, a flash of movement caught his eye.  Across the street, on the roof of a dilapidated warehouse, a figure emerged from the shadows. He couldn't make out any details - just a silhouette against the blinding sun. But something about its posture, the way it seemed to be watching him, sent a shiver down Eli's spine.
