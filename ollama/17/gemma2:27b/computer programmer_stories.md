Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Elias Finch's tiny apartment, mimicking the frantic rhythm of his fingers on the keyboard. Code scrolled across the screen, lines blurring into a sea of green and white. Elias, bleary-eyed but determined, wrestled with a stubborn bug in his latest project – a program designed to predict stock market trends with uncanny accuracy.

His cramped workspace, tucked into a corner of the living room, was a testament to his dedication: empty instant ramen cups littered the desk alongside crumpled energy drink cans. The air smelled faintly of stale coffee and burnt popcorn, casualties of countless late-night coding sessions. Outside, the neon glow of the city reflected in the puddles on the street below, painting an abstract cityscape that Elias barely noticed. His world was confined to the screen before him, a digital universe where he hoped to crack the code not just to financial success, but also to something far greater – understanding the hidden patterns of the world itself.
