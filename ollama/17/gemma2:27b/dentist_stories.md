The midday sun beat down on Elmwood Street, turning the Victorian houses into shimmering gingerbread replicas.  Inside his cluttered office at 237 Elmwood, Dr. Alistair Finch wrestled with a stubborn molar, sweat beading on his forehead despite the whir of the ceiling fan. A faint smell of cloves and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood from the unfortunate patient currently reclined in the chair.

Alistair sighed, his brow furrowed in concentration. Dentistry was supposed to be a precise science, but today felt anything but.  He glanced out the window at the swaying oak tree, its leaves casting dancing shadows on the worn rug. He longed for a brisk autumn breeze, crisp air that would wash away this stifling summer heat and the nagging sense of unease settling in his stomach. It wasn't just the molar. There was something else, a whisper of dread he couldn't quite pinpoint.
