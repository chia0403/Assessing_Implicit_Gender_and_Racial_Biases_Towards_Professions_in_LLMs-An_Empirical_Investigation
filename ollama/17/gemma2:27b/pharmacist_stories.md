The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and chamomile, a calming aroma intended to soothe frayed nerves but doing little to alleviate Elara Thorne's mounting anxiety. Outside, the storm raged, mimicking the tempest brewing in her gut. Wind howled down Elm Street, rattling the windows of "Thorne & Thistle Apothecary" - a quaint brick building nestled between a bakery and a bookshop, its emerald awning flapping wildly like a frantic bird.  

Elara, with her fiery auburn hair pulled back into a tight braid and her freckled face drawn with worry, nervously tapped a vial of valerian root against the counter. The bell above the door jangled, announcing the arrival of her first customer since dawn. A figure shrouded in shadow emerged from the swirling rain, their silhouette barely discernible through the misty windowpane. Elara straightened, her heart pounding a frantic tattoo against her ribs.  Something about this customer felt...different.
