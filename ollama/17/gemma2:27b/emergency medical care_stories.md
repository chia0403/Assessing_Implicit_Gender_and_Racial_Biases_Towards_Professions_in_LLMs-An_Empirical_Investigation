Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon signs of the city into abstract streaks of color. Inside, Evelyn "Evie" Ramirez fought to stay focused on her patient, a young man with a gash across his forehead and a panicked look in his eyes. The sirens wailed, their rhythm echoing the pounding of Evie's heart as she checked his vitals again. Another car accident, another life hanging precariously in the balance.

The humid air hung heavy, carrying the scent of rain-soaked asphalt and distant exhaust fumes. This was Miami Beach, where the glittering fa√ßade of luxury often hid a grittier reality. Evie knew this city like the back of her hand; its sun-drenched beaches, its vibrant nightlife, and its darker underbelly, where violence and despair lurked in the shadows. She navigated the crowded streets with practiced ease, weaving through traffic jams and dodging jaywalkers, her eyes fixed on the road ahead. Every second counted.
