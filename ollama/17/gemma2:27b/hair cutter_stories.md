The pungent scent of peroxide mingled with lavender shampoo hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume Amelia Rose knew better than her own mother's perfume. Sunlight streamed through the shop window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path and casting sharp shadows across the worn linoleum floor of "Amelia's Snips & Clips." It was a Tuesday morning, slow as molasses, and Amelia idly twirled a strand of auburn hair around her finger, contemplating the quiet lull.

A chime announced the arrival of a customer, breaking the spell. Amelia turned, her blue eyes widening with surprise. Standing hesitantly in the doorway was a woman unlike any she'd ever seen â€“ tall and willowy, draped in layers of shimmering emerald silk, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat adorned with a single, impossibly vibrant peacock feather.
