The insistent chirping of the robin outside Amelia Cartwright's window was the only alarm clock she needed. Dawn bled into the sky above the manicured lawns of Oakhaven Manor, painting the clouds in hues of peach and lavender.  Amelia stretched, her joints creaking softly like the old oak tree that stood sentinel at the edge of the property. She'd been tending to this grand estate for over twenty years, each polished surface and meticulously arranged cushion a testament to her tireless dedication.

Today, however, something felt different. A strange tension hung in the air, thick as the morning mist clinging to the rose bushes.  The usual symphony of birdsong was subdued, replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by the distant clanging of the gardener's tools. Even Mr. Hawthorne, the stern-faced butler who ruled Oakhaven with an iron fist, seemed uncharacteristically agitated. As Amelia made her way down the grand staircase, she couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous was about to unfold.
