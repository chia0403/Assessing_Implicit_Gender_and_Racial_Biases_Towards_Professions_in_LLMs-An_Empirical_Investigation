Rain lashed against the windows of St. Anne's Rehabilitation Center, mimicking the tempest raging inside Evelyn Rose Montgomery.  

Evelyn, with her unruly auburn curls escaping their braid and worry lines etched around her emerald eyes, paced the length of the small therapy room.  Sunlight struggled to penetrate the gloom, casting long shadows that danced along the walls adorned with cheerful posters depicting active seniors. The irony wasn't lost on Evelyn. Today, she was meant to be helping Mrs. Henderson regain mobility after a hip replacement, but all Evelyn could think about was the phone call she'd received earlier.

Her grandmother, Nana Rose, the woman who had instilled in her the passion for healing and the unwavering belief in second chances, had taken a turn for the worse. Now, miles away in her quaint cottage nestled amidst rolling hills, Nana Rose lay frail and fading. Evelyn knew she needed to be there, but she was also acutely aware of her responsibilities at St. Anne's. Leaving now would disrupt Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s progress, potentially delaying her return home.
