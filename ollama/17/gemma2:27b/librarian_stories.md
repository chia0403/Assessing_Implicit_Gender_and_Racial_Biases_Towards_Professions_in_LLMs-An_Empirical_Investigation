Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Blackwood Library, blurring the gaslights outside into hazy halos. Inside, Eleanor Vance straightened a stack of leather-bound volumes on a mahogany cart, her gaze drifting to the clock ticking relentlessly above the fireplace. It was past closing time, yet she lingered. Not for the first time, she felt a prickling unease in the silence that settled around her after the last patron had departed.

A shiver snaked down her spine, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something unseen was watching her from the shadows between the shelves.
