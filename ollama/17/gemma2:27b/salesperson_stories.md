The air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and diesel fumes, a strange but undeniably Bangkokian perfume. Elara Songchai wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, tucking a stray strand of dark hair behind her ear as she surveyed the crowded market stall. Bolts of shimmering silk fabric spilled over the edges, competing for space with hand-carved wooden elephants and fragrant incense sticks.

Elara wasn't here to haggle over souvenirs. Her mission was far more delicate: to convince Mr. Somchai, a notoriously shrewd textile merchant, to stock her company's latest line of sustainable dyes. It wouldn't be easy. Mr. Somchai was known for his traditional methods and his distrust of anything new-fangled. 

Taking a deep breath, Elara squared her shoulders, straightened the crisp silk blouse she wore (dyed, ironically, with her company's vibrant indigo), and prepared to charm her way into a deal.
