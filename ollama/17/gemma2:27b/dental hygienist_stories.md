Rain lashed against the window of Dr. Anya Patel's office, blurring the already dreary view of the strip mall parking lot. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Chen meticulously polished a set of dentures, the rhythmic whirring of her ultrasonic cleaner a steady counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Amy wasn't fazed by the weather – she'd seen enough rain in her 25 years living in Seattle to last a lifetime.

But today was different. Today was the day Dr. Patel had promised a surprise, and Amy's curiosity simmered beneath her calm exterior. Was it new equipment? A bonus for exceeding patient quotas?  Or maybe...a new dental assistant to help with the ever-increasing workload? 


Amy glanced at the clock – 10:45 AM. Dr. Patel was usually late, but never *this* late. Maybe the surprise involved her absence altogether? A flicker of apprehension danced in Amy's chest. She liked Dr. Patel. They had a good rapport, and Amy appreciated the flexibility she was given with her hours. The thought of working with someone new, someone unknown, unsettled her.
