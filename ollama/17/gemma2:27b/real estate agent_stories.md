The salty tang of the ocean breeze whipped through Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's auburn hair as she surveyed the dilapidated Victorian mansion perched precariously on the cliff edge. Salt spray coated the peeling paint and rusted ironwork railings, making the whole structure look like a forgotten shipwreck run aground on the jagged rocks below. Ellie shivered, despite the late summer sun warming her back. This wasn't exactly the charming coastal cottage she usually dealt with in her real estate business.

This was Seahaven Manor, a relic of a bygone era, shrouded in whispers and rumors. Locals avoided it, claiming it was haunted by the ghost of its former owner, a shipping magnate who met a grisly end on a stormy night a century ago. Ellie, however, saw potential beneath the crumbling facade - ornate moldings peeking through layers of dust, stained glass windows hinting at forgotten grandeur. 


This wasn't just another listing for Ellie; it was a challenge. Could she breathe life back into this haunted behemoth and convince someone to call Seahaven Manor home?
