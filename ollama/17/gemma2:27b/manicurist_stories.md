The air hung heavy with the scent of acetone and lavender. Outside, neon signs flickered to life, painting the rain-slicked alleyway in alternating hues of pink and turquoise.  Inside "Nails by Nala," however, the only light came from the trio of desk lamps illuminating Natalia Perez's meticulous work.

Natalia, with her fiery red curls piled atop her head like a crown of cinnamon, was lost in concentration. Her client, Mrs. Goldberg, chatted animatedly about her grandson's upcoming bar mitzvah while Natalia delicately applied a shimmering gold polish to each nail. The rhythmic tapping of the file against Mrs. Goldberg's nails provided a steady beat to the symphony of city sounds filtering in from outside â€“ car horns, distant sirens, and the occasional yowl of a stray cat. 

But tonight, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced on Natalia's skin, a whisper of unease mingling with the familiar scents of her trade. It started subtly, like a change in the wind, but it grew stronger with every passing minute, culminating in a jolt that sent shivers down her spine. 

Natalia glanced at the clock - 9:47 pm.  Too late for walk-ins. Mrs. Goldberg was her last appointment of the night. Yet, the feeling persisted, an insistent hum beneath the surface of normalcy. Natalia couldn't shake the sense that something unexpected, perhaps even unwelcome, was about to unfold.
