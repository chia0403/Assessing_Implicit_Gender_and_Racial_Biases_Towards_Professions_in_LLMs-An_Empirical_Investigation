Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Petal & Bloom," blurring the vibrant colours of the tulips and lilies arranged in neat rows. Emilia Rose Hawthorne sighed, her breath fogging the glass. Another dreary Tuesday in Oakhaven, a quaint town nestled amidst rolling hills that seemed to perpetually wear a veil of mist. 

The bell above the door chimed softly, startling Emilia from her reverie. A man stood hesitantly on the threshold, his tall frame swallowed by a rain-soaked trench coat. Water dripped from the brim of his fedora, obscuring his features. He looked like he belonged in a noir film, not a cozy flower shop.  

Emilia straightened her apron and offered him a tentative smile. "Good morning. Welcome to Petal & Bloom. What can I do for you?"
