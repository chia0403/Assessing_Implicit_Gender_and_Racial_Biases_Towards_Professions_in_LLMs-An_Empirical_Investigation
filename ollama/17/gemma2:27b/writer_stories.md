Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, mimicking the staccato rhythm of Elara Blackwood's fingers flying across the keyboard. The cramped space was illuminated by a single bare bulb, casting long, dancing shadows on the dusty stacks of books and forgotten furniture that crammed the room. Elara, her dark curls escaping their braid and falling over her forehead in damp strands, was lost in the world she was crafting, oblivious to the storm raging outside. 

Her latest manuscript lay open on the ancient oak desk before her - a sprawling fantasy epic titled "The Obsidian Throne."  For months, she had poured every ounce of her imagination into its pages, breathing life into fantastical creatures and perilous quests, forging alliances and igniting bitter feuds. Tonight, though, a persistent snag in the plot threatened to derail her progress. How could she realistically weave the prophecy of the Crimson Dragon into the unfolding narrative without resorting to clumsy exposition?

The wind howled, rattling the old windowpane, as if echoing Elara's frustration. She leaned back in her chair, the worn cushions groaning under her weight, and stared out at the swirling grey chaos beyond the glass. A flicker of lightning illuminated the skeletal branches of a gnarled oak tree that stood sentinel outside, its leaves clawing desperately at the stormy sky.  Perhaps inspiration lurked amidst the tempestuous beauty of the storm?
