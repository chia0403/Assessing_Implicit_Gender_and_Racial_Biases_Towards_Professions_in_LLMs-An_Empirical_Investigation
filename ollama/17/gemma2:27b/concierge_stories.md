The chandeliers in The Grand Astoria's lobby glittered like a thousand captured stars, their light reflecting off the polished marble floor and the immaculately dressed guests milling about. Eloise Sinclair, with her perfectly coiffed auburn hair and a smile that could charm a gargoyle, stood behind the concierge desk, her fingers dancing across the gleaming mahogany surface. A symphony of hushed voices, clinking champagne flutes, and the soft melody from the hidden orchestra painted a backdrop to Eloise's world â€“ a world she navigated with the grace of a seasoned conductor. 

Tonight, however, a discordant note threatened the symphony. A stranger stood before her, his face shrouded in shadow by the brim of his fedora. He clutched a worn leather suitcase and his eyes, when they finally met Eloise's, held an unsettling intensity.  "I need to see Mr. Alistair Hawthorne," he rasped, his voice as rough as gravel.

Eloise felt a shiver run down her spine. Mr. Hawthorne, the hotel's enigmatic owner, rarely received visitors. And this man, with his air of secrecy and desperation, was unlike any guest she had encountered in her years at The Grand Astoria.
