The acrid smell of chlorine and stagnant water hung heavy in the air, clinging to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' greasy overalls like an unwanted guest. A symphony of dripping faucets and gurgling pipes filled the cramped basement bathroom, punctuated by the occasional mournful groan from the ancient cast iron radiator. Bart sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. This was shaping up to be another one of those jobs – the kind that made you question your life choices. 

The house, a Victorian behemoth with peeling paint and crooked shutters, stood perched precariously on a hill overlooking the town of Oakhaven. Bart had seen better days for both houses and humans. The homeowner, Mrs. Agatha Grimshaw, was a formidable woman with a voice that could curdle milk and a glare that could melt steel. 

"Hurry along now, Higgins!" she'd barked from the top of the stairs, her words echoing down like thunder. "This blasted leak is ruining my prize-winning begonias!"


Bart surveyed the mess before him – a tangle of rusty pipes and mismatched fittings, all leading to a sink that wouldn't stop spitting water.  He knew this was going to be a long afternoon.
