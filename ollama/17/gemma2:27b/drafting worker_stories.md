Rain hammered on the corrugated iron roof of the drafter's shed, each drop a tiny percussionist in a relentless symphony. Inside, Elias Finch hunched over his drafting table, the faint glow of the oil lamp casting long shadows across his face and the meticulously detailed blueprints laid before him.  Elias wasn't just any draftsman; he was known throughout the city as "Finch the Fastidious," famed for the precision and artistry with which he rendered architectural dreams onto parchment.

The air in the shed was thick with the scent of lamp oil, graphite, and aged paper. Elias squinted through his spectacles at the lines before him, tracing the delicate curve of a balustrade on a grand mansion planned for the wealthy textile baron, Mr. Hawthorne. Outside, the wind howled, mimicking the restlessness brewing within Elias himself.  He had been working on this commission for weeks, each detail meticulously rendered, but something felt amiss. 


This wasn't just any job; it was his chance to prove himself. A chance to leave behind the cramped shed and step into a proper drafting office. Mr. Hawthorne, with his grand plans and even grander purse, could be Elias's ticket to a brighter future. But as the hours ticked by, Elias felt a nagging doubt gnawing at his confidence. He had meticulously followed Mr. Hawthorne’s instructions, but something about the design, about the placement of that balustrade… it just didn't feel right.
