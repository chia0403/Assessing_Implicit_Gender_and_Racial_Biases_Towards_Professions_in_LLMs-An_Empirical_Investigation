The rusty whine of the Cessna 172’s engine echoed through the pre-dawn stillness, barely audible over the insistent chirping of cicadas in the overgrown field. Amelia "Ace" Hawthorne squinted at the instrument panel, her reflection flickering in the cracked Plexiglas. A thin sheen of sweat glistened on her brow despite the cool morning air seeping in through gaps in the aging fuselage.  

The runway ahead was barely discernible – a rutted strip of dirt choked with weeds and obscured by a veil of mist rising from the swamp bordering it. This wasn’t Amelia’s usual landing strip, but desperate times called for desperate measures. She needed to get this load delivered, no matter the risk.
