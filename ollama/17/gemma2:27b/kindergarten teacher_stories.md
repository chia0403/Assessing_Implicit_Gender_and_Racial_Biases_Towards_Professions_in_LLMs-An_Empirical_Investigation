The crayon drawing on Ms. Amelia Willowbrook's desk depicted a purple sun with seven rays and a giant smiling caterpillar munching on a cloud.  Amelia smiled, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the chaos of her kindergarten classroom. Tiny chairs were haphazardly strewn around the room, evidence of a recent game of musical chairs gone awry. A trail of glitter led from the art table to the reading nook, and the unmistakable scent of fingerpaint lingered in the air.

It was 3:00 pm, and the usual afternoon lull had yet to arrive.  Five-year-olds were notoriously unpredictable creatures, their energy levels fluctuating like a yo-yo on a string. Amelia loved them dearly, but even she longed for a moment of quiet, a chance to sip her lukewarm tea and catch her breath before the onslaught of pick-up time.
