The sun, a molten fist in the bruised sky, beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he wrestled the behemoth excavator into position. Dust devils danced across the barren expanse, mocking his attempts at precision. The air hung thick and heavy, smelling of diesel fumes and burnt earth. Around him stretched miles of what used to be lush farmland, now scarred and gouged by the insatiable maw of progress. A new highway was being carved through the heartland, swallowing everything in its path. Eli, a man whose hands were calloused and strong from years of coaxing steel giants into submission, felt a growing unease amidst the chaos. 

It wasn't just the unrelenting heat or the gnawing guilt of destroying something beautiful. There was something else, something unsettling that whispered on the wind - a disquiet in the land itself, an ancient sorrow stirring beneath the surface.
