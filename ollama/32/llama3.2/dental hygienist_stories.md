Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a dental hygienist as the main character:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the sleepy coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets lined with shops and restaurants. Dr. Sophia Elena Vasquez, a 35-year-old dental hygienist, wiped down the counter of her family's dental practice, The Cozy Smile, as she sipped on a steaming cup of coffee.

Sophia had spent countless hours in this very same office, scrubbing away at the tartar and plaque that seemed to accumulate on every patient's teeth. But today was different. Today, Sophia felt restless, like there was more to life than the routine of cleaning teeth and making patients smile. She had always dreamed of traveling the world, exploring new cultures and meeting new people, but as a single mother working to support her 8-year-old son, Alex, she had put those dreams on hold.

As she finished prepping for the day's appointments, Sophia gazed out the window at the bustling harbor, where fishermen were unloading their catch and the sound of seagulls filled the air. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved living in Tidal Cove - the natural beauty, the sense of community, and the feeling that anything could happen on a sunny morning just like this one.

But Sophia's thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of her best friend and practice manager, Rachel, who burst into the office with a panicked expression on her face. "Sophia, it's happening," she whispered urgently, her eyes darting around the room as if she feared being overheard.
