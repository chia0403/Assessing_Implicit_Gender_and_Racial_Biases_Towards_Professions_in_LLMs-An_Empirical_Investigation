Maybe it was the lingering fatigue from a sleepless night, or perhaps it was the nagging sense of unease that had been growing inside her since the phone call earlier that morning.

Whatever the reason, Phoebe couldn't shake off the feeling that something was about to go terribly wrong. She took a deep breath and steeled herself for the task ahead, her eyes never leaving the patient's anxious face as she reached for the syringe...
