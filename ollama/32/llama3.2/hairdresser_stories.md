The smell of saltwater and freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of seagulls crying overhead.

Still, Emilia was both intrigued and intimidated by the prospect of working with such a fascinating (and feared) figure.

As she began to style her own locks for the night ahead, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that tonight's appointment would be anything but ordinary...
