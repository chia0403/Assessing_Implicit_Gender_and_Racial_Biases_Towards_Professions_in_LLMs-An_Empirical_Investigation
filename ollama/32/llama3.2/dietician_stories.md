Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the small coastal town of Tidal Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling pier and the rows of shops and restaurants that lined its edges. The air was filled with the salty scent of sea spray and the sound of seagulls crying overhead.

Dr. Sophia Elizabeth Thompson, a renowned dietician with a passion for helping people eat their way to better health, sat at her desk in the office above the local health food store, sipping on a cup of green tea and staring out at the ocean view. She had just finished a particularly grueling session with a new client, who was struggling to lose weight despite months of dieting.

As she pondered her next move, Sophia's mind wandered back to the mysterious package that had arrived at her office earlier that day. It was a small, unmarked box wrapped in brown paper and twine, with no return address and no indication of what it might contain. The only clue was a cryptic note attached to the outside of the package, scrawled in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at the old lighthouse at midnight. Come alone."

Sophia's curiosity was piqued, and she couldn't help but wonder what secrets the mysterious package might hold. Little did she know, this would be just the beginning of a journey that would take her to the depths of Tidal Cove's hidden history, and challenge everything she thought she knew about food, health, and herself.

How does this sound?
