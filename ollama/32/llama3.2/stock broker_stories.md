Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had long since set on the bustling streets of Manhattan, casting a warm orange glow over the towering skyscrapers of Wall Street. The hum of the city never truly slept, but for Jack Edward "Jack" Thompson, CEO of Thompson & Co., it was already time to start his day.

Perched atop his 30th-floor office, looking out over the glittering lights of the financial district, Jack felt a sense of pride and accomplishment wash over him. He had built his career from scratch, working tirelessly to turn his small investment firm into one of the most respected players on the market.

As he gazed out at the city, Jack's mind began to wander to the meeting he had with his top client, billionaire investor Harrison Green, scheduled for 9 AM sharp. The deal they were negotiating was worth millions, and Jack knew that getting it right would make or break Thompson & Co.'s future.

But as he turned away from the window, his eyes caught on a small, unassuming package on his desk. It was addressed to him, but there was no return address and no indication of who might have sent it. The plain white envelope seemed out of place among the sleek, high-tech gadgets that lined Jack's office.

Curious, Jack picked up the envelope and turned it over in his hand. He knew better than to open anything without knowing who had sent it, but something about this package felt...off. Suddenly, Jack's instincts were on high alert. What was inside this mysterious package, and who could have sent it?
