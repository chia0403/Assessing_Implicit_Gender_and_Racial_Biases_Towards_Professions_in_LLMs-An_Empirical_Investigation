Here's a potential story opening:

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a grey mist over the already cramped streets of New Haven. It was a typical autumn evening in this small, industrial town, where the only thing more plentiful than the trash than the people who made their livings sorting it out.

In her small office above the dumpster at 345 Main Street, investigative reporter Evelyn Anne Welles poured herself a lukewarm cup of coffee and stared out the grimy window at the city below. The neon signs of the local bars and diners reflected off the wet pavement like a bad tattoo, casting an eerie glow over the deserted sidewalks.

Evelyn's eyes scanned the news wires on her computer screen, searching for the latest story to sink her teeth into. She was known in New Haven as one of the toughest, most tenacious reporters around - always sniffing out the big scoop and never backing down from a fight.

Tonight, however, something felt off. A hunch had been nagging at Evelyn all day, ever since she'd received a cryptic phone call from an anonymous source that morning. The caller had whispered only two words in her ear before hanging up: "Raven's Peak".
