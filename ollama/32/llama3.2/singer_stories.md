Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The dimly lit studio was silent, except for the soft hum of the guitar amplifier in the corner. Aurora Wystan, a 25-year-old singer-songwriter with a voice like honey and smoke, sat on the edge of her chair, her eyes fixed on the microphone in front of her. The fluorescent lights above flickered, casting an eerie glow over the room.

Aurora's fingers danced across the fretboard of her guitar, coaxing out a melancholy melody that seemed to capture the mood of the entire city. It was a rainy night in March, and the streets outside were empty and gray, like the sky itself had given up hope. But inside this small studio, surrounded by dusty old instruments and faded concert posters, Aurora felt alive.

She had always known she wanted to be a singer. Growing up in the sleepy town of Ashwood, where everyone knew everyone's business, she would sing in her room for hours on end, belting out tunes that only seemed to exist inside her head. But now, as she sat on the cusp of stardom, Aurora couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

Aurora took a deep breath and began to sing, letting her voice soar through the empty studio like a bird set free. The notes were raw and emotional, pouring out of her like blood from a wound. As she sang, the shadows on the walls seemed to come alive, like dark spirits dancing to the rhythm of her music.

And yet, despite the magic that seemed to emanate from her very pores, Aurora couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. That something – or someone – was waiting just outside those studio doors, waiting for her to slip up and reveal her true self.
