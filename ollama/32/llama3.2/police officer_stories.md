Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

Detective Emily Rose Thompson stood at the edge of the rain-soaked pier, gazing out at the dark waters of Puget Sound. The city of Seattle was always alive with energy, but on nights like these, when the mist rolled in off the ocean and shrouded everything in a damp gray veil, it felt especially foreboding.

As she scanned the deserted pier, her eyes caught on a figure huddled at the far end, wrapped in a worn denim jacket and clutching a battered cardboard cup. Emily's trained instincts immediately went on high alert – this was no ordinary drifter. There was something about the way he seemed to be watching the water, his eyes lost in thought, that sent a shiver down her spine.

She radioed for backup, her voice low and steady as she spoke into the comms device on her wrist. "Units 12 and 17, I need assistance at the pier. Possible homicide scene. Requesting additional units to secure the perimeter."

As she waited for her team to arrive, Emily's gaze never left the mysterious figure. Who was he? What had brought him out here tonight? And what did he have to do with the disappearance of local teenager, Sarah Lee – whose mother, a prominent businesswoman, had gone missing just hours before?

The rain began to fall harder, drumming against her leather jacket as Emily's mind began to spin with possibilities. She took a deep breath, squinting through the misty veil, and steeled herself for what was about to come.

"Okay," she whispered into her radio, "time to get to work."
