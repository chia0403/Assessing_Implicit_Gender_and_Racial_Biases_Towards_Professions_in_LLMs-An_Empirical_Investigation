Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished black leather as Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment, shaking the droplets from her long, dark brown coat. It was a chilly autumn evening in 1995, and the Pacific Northwest was known for its gray skies, but tonight the fog seemed especially thick, obscuring the glittering lights of the city's iconic Space Needle.

Lexi, a determined and resourceful journalist in her late twenties, took a deep breath as she gazed out at the dark waters of Puget Sound. She had always felt most alive when the rain was pouring down, its rhythmic beat matching the pounding of her own heart. And tonight, she had a story that felt like it could change everything.

As she locked the door behind her, Lexi slipped on her worn leather gloves and began to make her way through the wet streets, her eyes fixed on the address scrawled on a crumpled piece of paper in her hand: 3454 East Madison Street. It was an old Victorian house, rumored to be the residence of the reclusive millionaire Henry Blackwood. Lexi had received a cryptic letter earlier that day, hinting at a shocking revelation about Blackwood's past, and she knew that she had to get to the bottom of it.

Little did she know, her investigation would lead her down a dark path, one that would test her courage, her wits, and her very sense of justice.
