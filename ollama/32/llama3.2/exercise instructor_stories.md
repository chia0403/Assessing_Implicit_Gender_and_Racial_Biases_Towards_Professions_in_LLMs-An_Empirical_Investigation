The sun had just begun to set over the bustling streets of Downtown Los Angeles, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded sidewalks and neon-lit storefronts. The smell of freshly brewed coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the sound of laughter and chatter from passersby.

Inside the sleek, modern gym that Kaitlyn Rose Thompson owned and operated, "Sweat & Strength," a sense of excitement and anticipation hung in the air.
