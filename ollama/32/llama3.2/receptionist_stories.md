Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

It was a drizzly Wednesday morning in late October when Emily Rae Wilson trudged into the office, her eyes half-closed from the early dawn commute and the lingering fatigue of a long weekend spent at home recovering from a nasty cold. She shuffled through the lobby, exchanging quiet hellos with the sleepy security guard who nodded in greeting as she made her way to the reception desk.

The old stone building that housed the offices of Wilson & Co., a mid-sized law firm in downtown Seattle, seemed to loom over Emily like a damp specter, its Gothic spires and gargoyles reaching towards the gray sky like skeletal fingers. As she settled into her chair, the soft glow of the fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie pallor on the drab beige walls, making the whole space feel like a damp cave.

Emily yawned, stretching her arms above her head to work out the kinks from sleeping in too deep and waking up with a crick in her neck. She rubbed the sleep from her eyes, gazing out the window as the rain pattered against the glass, casting tiny rivulets of water down the pane like a slow-moving film.

It was just another day at Wilson & Co., where Emily spent most of her time answering phones, scheduling appointments, and pretending to be interested in the latest developments in litigation law. But little did anyone know that this was about to change - for better or for worse - with the arrival of a mysterious new client who would shake up the status quo of the firm, and put Emily's own life on an uncertain trajectory.
