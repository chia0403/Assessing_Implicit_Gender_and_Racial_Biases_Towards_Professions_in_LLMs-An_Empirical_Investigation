Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the bustling streets of Portland, Oregon, casting a warm orange glow over the crowded food cart pod on SE Main Street. The air was filled with the sweet scent of freshly baked goods and the hum of lively chatter as patrons waited in line for their favorite treats.

Inside one of the carts, "Sugar & Spice," Emily Rose Thompson expertly piped a delicate border onto a wedding cake, her hands moving with precision and artistry as she worked to create the perfect finish. As a freelance cake decorator, Emily had built a loyal client base among Portland's trendy couples and special occasion enthusiasts. She took pride in crafting intricate designs that were both beautiful and delicious, often incorporating seasonal flavors and ingredients into her creations.

As she finished the last of the piping, Emily gazed out at the crowded cart, feeling grateful for this life she'd created for herself. It wasn't always easy â€“ the hours were long, the competition was fierce, and the pressure to produce perfect desserts day in and day out could be overwhelming. But there was something about making people happy with her creations that made it all worth it.

Just then, Emily's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend and business partner, Lily. "Hey Em, I need you to meet me at the bakery ASAP," the message read. "We've got a crazy wedding cake order coming in tonight... and I have a feeling it's going to be trouble."

Emily's heart sank as she wondered what kind of trouble could possibly arise on a typical Tuesday evening. But with Lily by her side, she knew she was ready for whatever came next.
