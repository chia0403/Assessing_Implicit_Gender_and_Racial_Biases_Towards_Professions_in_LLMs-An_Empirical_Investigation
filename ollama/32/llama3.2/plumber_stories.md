Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ravenswood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like this, when the darkness seemed to press in from all sides like a physical force. It was as if the very fabric of the town itself was wrapped tightly around its residents, holding them captive beneath a shroud of gloom and mist.

Inside the cramped, dimly lit workshop of "McGowan's Plumbing", Jack McGowan hunched over his workbench, his calloused hands moving with practiced ease as he wrestled with a stubborn pipe fitting. The soft glow of the overhead light above cast eerie shadows on the walls, making it seem as though the pipes themselves were writhing and twisting like living serpents.

Jack was a man in his mid-forties, with a thick beard and eyes that seemed to hold a perpetual glint of weariness. He had spent years working the streets of Ravenswood, fixing leaky faucets and unclogging drains for the town's residents, but tonight he felt like something was off. The wind outside howled through the streets like a chorus of restless spirits, and Jack couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.

Just as he finished tightening the last bolt on the pipe, the workshop door creaked open, admitting a blast of cold air and a figure shrouded in shadows. "Got a job for me?" Jack asked gruffly, his hand instinctively going to the wrench that hung from a hook on the wall.

The figure stepped forward, its features illuminated by a faint light that seemed to emanate from within its very being. For a moment, Jack's eyes locked onto those of the stranger, and he felt a jolt of recognition run through him like ice water. It was as though he had seen this person before, but couldn't quite place where.

"McGowan," the figure said, its voice low and smooth. "I have a job that requires your particular... talents."

And with that, Jack's world began to shift on its axis, plunging him into a darkness from which he knew he might never emerge again.
