Here's a potential story opening:

The neon signs of the city's bars and clubs cast a gaudy glow over the rain-soaked streets of downtown New Haven. Inside "McGillicuddy's Pub", the only sound was the hum of the refrigerators and the occasional clinking of glasses as Jack "JD" McGillicuddy polished a mug with a dirty rag.

At 25, JD had been tending bar for over five years, watching generations of locals come and go. He knew everyone's story, from the struggling artist who sipped on cheap beer to the wealthy businessman who ordered a $15 whiskey. JD had seen it all, but tonight felt different. The pub was quiet, with only a handful of patrons huddled at the bar or nursing tables. The air was thick with tension, like the storm outside was going to break at any moment.

JD wiped down the counter for what felt like the hundredth time that night, his mind wandering back to the strange phone call he'd received earlier that day. A mysterious woman's voice on the other end, speaking in hushed tones and asking him a question that had left him feeling unsettled: "JD, do you know anything about the Blackwater?"
