Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes, 32-year-old Elijah Julian Watts made his way to his workshop, a small, cluttered garage tucked away on Elm Street. The sign above the door read "E.J. Watts Electric" in faded letters, and Elijah's eyes crinkled at the corners as he smiled to himself - this was where he felt most at home.

Ravenswood was a place where time seemed to stand still, where the air was thick with the scent of freshly cut grass and the sound of children's laughter carried on the breeze. It was a town where everyone knew each other's names, and Elijah was no exception - he'd grown up here, learned the trade from his father, who'd passed away when Elijah was just a teenager.

As an electrician, Elijah had seen his fair share of broken circuits, flickering lights, and faulty wiring. But tonight, as he began to unpack his tools and prep for the next day's jobs, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease settled in the pit of his stomach, like a cold draft on a chilly autumn evening.

Elijah pushed the feeling aside, telling himself it was just nerves - he'd been working late hours all week, and maybe he just needed to get some rest. But as he locked up the garage and headed out into the night air, he couldn't help but wonder what was waiting for him in the shadows of Ravenswood's quiet streets...
