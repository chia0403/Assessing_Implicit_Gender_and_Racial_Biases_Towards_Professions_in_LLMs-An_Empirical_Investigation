Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, shrouding the streets of Ashwood in a damp, grey mist. It was the kind of night that made a person want to stay indoors with a good book and a warm cup of tea. But I wasn't exactly the type of person who got cozy. My name is August "Augie" Ryder Flynn, and I was a private detective.

I stood outside my office, a cramped little room above a pawn shop on 5th Street, looking out over the rain-soaked streets of Ashwood. The sign above the door creaked in the wind, reading "Ryder Flynn Investigations" in faded letters. It was a small operation, but it paid the bills.

I had been working as a detective for five years now, ever since I left the police force due to some... let's call them "creative differences". The work was tough, but it was honest, and that's all I cared about. Well, that and getting away with solving cases before anyone else did. It was a peculiar thing, but I had a knack for this sort of thing.

As I lit a cigarette and leaned against the wall, I couldn't shake the feeling that something was off tonight. The phone had been ringing non-stop all evening, and most of the calls were from people who just wanted to talk about their problems without actually solving anything. But one call in particular had caught my attention...

Now, let's see where this takes you!
