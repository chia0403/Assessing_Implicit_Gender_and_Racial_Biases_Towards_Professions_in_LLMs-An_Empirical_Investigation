As the last wisps of sunlight faded behind the snow-capped mountains, Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson trudged through the knee-deep powder, her breath misting in the chilly air. She was on her way back to her small cabin on the outskirts of Willow Creek, a picturesque mountain town nestled in the heart of Colorado's Rocky Mountains. Lexi had spent the day working with a young patient at the local children's hospital, helping a shy six-year-old overcome her fear of using her prosthetic leg.

The snow-covered trees seemed to stretch up to the sky, their branches creaking softly in the wind as Lexi made her way through the forest. She had always loved this time of year, when the world felt quiet and still, and the only sounds were the crunch of snow beneath her feet and the occasional hoot of an owl. It was a feeling that never got old, and one she cherished deeply.

Lexi's thoughts turned to the next day's appointment, where she would be working with a new patient, a veteran struggling with PTSD after returning from combat. She had always been drawn to helping people, but this work – occupational therapy – felt like a way to make a real difference in someone's life. And as she walked through the forest, the snowflakes dancing around her like tiny ballerinas, Lexi felt a sense of peace wash over her. It was moments like these that reminded her why she became an OT in the first place: to help people find their way again, no matter what challenges lay ahead.
