Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a dentist as the main character:

**Story Opening:**

Dr. Emily Adelaide Wellesley sat in her dimly lit dental office, the soft glow of the computer screen casting an eerie light on her face as she stared at the stack of unpaid bills in front of her. The fluorescent lights above the dental chairs flickered and hummed, a familiar comfort in a day that had already felt like a struggle. It was 8:45 PM on a Tuesday, and Emily was supposed to be home with her husband, Michael, and their two-year-old son, Jack, but she'd ended up putting off the paperwork until now.

**Setting:**

The small town of Willow Creek was a charming, sleepy community nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. The streets were lined with old oak trees, their gnarled branches creaking in the gentle breeze that carried the scent of rain and damp earth. Emily's dental office, Wellesley Dental Care, was situated on Main Street, just above the town's beloved bakery, Sweet Treats. Across the street, the old movie theater stood vacant, its faded sign reading "Cinema Royale" a constant reminder of Willow Creek's rich history.

As she sorted through the bills, Emily's mind wandered to her husband Michael, who was working late at his own job as a journalist for the local newspaper. Their son Jack was sleeping soundly in his crib upstairs, dreaming of dinosaurs and candy. But despite the peacefulness of their home life, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The town's economy had been struggling lately, and she'd heard rumors of businesses closing and jobs being lost. She pushed the thoughts aside, focusing on the bills in front of her.

But as she began to organize the stack, a piece of paper slipped out from between them, catching her eye. It was an invitation to a town hall meeting, scheduled for that night at 7 PM at the community center. The topic: "Exploring Options for Willow Creek's Future." Emily felt a shiver run down her spine as she read the words. What did this mean for their small town? And what role would she play in its future?
