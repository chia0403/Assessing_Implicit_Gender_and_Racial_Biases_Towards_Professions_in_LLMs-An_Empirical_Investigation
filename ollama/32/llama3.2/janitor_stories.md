Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dim fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the drab, linoleum-floored corridors of Ravenswood High School. It was a chilly autumn evening in October 2023, and the students had long since gone home for the day. The only sound was the soft hum of the school's ancient HVAC system and the occasional creak of the old wooden floors beneath the feet of the lone janitor, Elmer Edgar Winston III.

Elmer, or "Eli" to those who knew him, trudged through the empty hallways, his worn sneakers making barely a sound on the tile. He had been working as a janitor at Ravenswood for over 20 years, and he knew every nook and cranny of the school like the back of his hand. Despite his dedication to his job, Eli felt like a ghost, invisible to the very people he was supposed to be serving.

As he emptied the trash cans in the cafeteria, Eli's eyes wandered out the window to the overcast sky. The clouds seemed to match his mood â€“ grey and oppressive. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was off, that something was waiting for him just beyond the edge of perception.

Little did Eli know, his life was about to take a dramatic turn. A mysterious letter had arrived at school earlier that day, addressed to him in handwriting he didn't recognize. The words "Meet me in room 314" were scrawled across the top, followed by a single sentence that made Eli's heart skip a beat: "Your past is waiting for you."
