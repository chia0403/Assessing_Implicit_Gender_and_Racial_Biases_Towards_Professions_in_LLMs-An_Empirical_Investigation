The asphalt was slick with morning dew, reflecting the dawn sky in an oily sheen.  The air hung heavy with the scent of diesel and pine needles, a familiar aroma for Bartholomew "Bart" O'Malley, as he started his day patching potholes on Highway 71. The sun hadn't yet breached the horizon, casting long shadows across the desolate stretch of road snaking through the Montana wilderness.  The only other sound besides the rasping of Bart's shovel was the mournful cry of a distant hawk circling above. He took a swig from his thermos, the lukewarm coffee doing little to chase away the chill that seeped into his bones despite the thick layers of flannel and wool he wore. His calloused hands gripped the handle, each bump in the road a reminder of the harsh realities of his life â€“ a solitary existence spent battling the elements and the relentless monotony of road repair. Today, however, promised to be different. 


Bart could feel it in his gut, a prickling sensation that sent a shiver down his spine. He wasn't sure what it was, but something about the stillness of the morning felt off, like the calm before a storm.
