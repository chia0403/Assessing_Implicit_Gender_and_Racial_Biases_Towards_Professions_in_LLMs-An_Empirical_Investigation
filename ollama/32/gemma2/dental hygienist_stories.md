The air hung thick with the sterile scent of peppermint and bleach, a fragrance that Eleanor Beatrice Thompson found both calming and unsettling. It was like walking into a sanitized version of reality, where the only sounds were the whirring of the ultrasonic scaler and the occasional nervous sigh from a patient braced for their cleaning. Ellie, as she preferred to be called, navigated the familiar maze of dental chairs, her stethoscope bouncing gently against her scrubs. 

She paused at the doorway of room three, peering inside. A young woman sat hunched in the chair, chewing nervously on her lip. Her file revealed a student nurse named Sarah Jenkins, anxious about a chipped tooth that had been bothering her for weeks. Ellie smiled reassuringly.

"Hi Sarah, I'm Ellie," she said, stepping into the room. "Ready to get that taken care of?" 


Ellie's world was the bright, chrome-laden domain of Dr. Lewisâ€™s dental practice in a bustling Chicago suburb. A haven for pearly whites and nervous chatter, where gossip about the neighbourhood flowed freely alongside fluoride rinses.
