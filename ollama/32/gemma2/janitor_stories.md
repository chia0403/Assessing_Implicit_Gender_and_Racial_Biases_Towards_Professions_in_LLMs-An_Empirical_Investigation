The stale air hung thick in the bowels of the Grand Blackwood Theatre, clinging to Bartholomew Thistlewick like a second skin. It smelled of dust, forgotten dreams, and the faint, cloying scent of mothballs â€“ a potent aroma that Bartholomew had come to associate with both sorrow and solace.  

He pushed his mop across the sticky linoleum floor, its frayed edges catching on loose threads and grit. The stage lights above cast long, distorted shadows, making Bartholomew's already gaunt figure appear even more skeletal against the backdrop of velvet curtains, now faded and patched like a well-loved quilt. 

Bartholomew, or "Bart" as he was known to the handful of regulars who ventured into this twilight realm after closing time, loved the theatre. Not for the glamour of its past, nor the whispered legends of haunted dressing rooms, but for the hushed stillness that descended upon it after the final curtain fell. It was a space where thoughts echoed unburdened, and loneliness found a strange kind of comfort in shared silence. 


The Grand Blackwood had seen better days, that much was clear.  Its once-vibrant facade now wore a patina of neglect, its ornate balconies draped in cobwebs, and the laughter that once filled its hallowed halls replaced with an unsettling quietude. But for Bartholomew, even in its decay, it held a kind of beauty - a testament to the fleeting nature of time and the enduring power of dreams.
