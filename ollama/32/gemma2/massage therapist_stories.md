The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint aroma of stale coffee from the nearby café. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of Willow Creek Massage Therapy, illuminating motes dancing in the warm air.  

Amelia Rose Thornbury, her long fingers delicately kneading a ball of dough for sourdough bread, glanced at the clock ticking on the wall. 8:55 AM. Just five minutes until the first appointment of the day. She carefully placed the risen dough into its proving basket, humming softly to herself. It was a Saturday morning ritual - baking and calming her mind before the day’s flow of aching shoulders, tight hamstrings, and knotted anxieties washed over her.

Amelia wasn't just any massage therapist. Her touch, whisper-light yet powerful, seemed to possess an almost magical quality. People would leave her studio not only feeling physically relaxed but also with a sense of lightness, as if the burdens they carried had been gently lifted.  It was this gift, this ability to soothe both body and soul, that drew people in, whispering about Amelia Thornbury's healing touch throughout Willow Creek.


Today, though, Amelia felt a flicker of unease beneath her usual calm. A new client, Mr. Silas Blackwood, was booked for 9:00 AM.  His request – a deep tissue massage focusing on his “inner turmoil” – had set off a tiny alarm in her gut. She couldn't quite explain why, but something about this appointment felt different. Like the beginning of a story she wasn't yet ready to read.
