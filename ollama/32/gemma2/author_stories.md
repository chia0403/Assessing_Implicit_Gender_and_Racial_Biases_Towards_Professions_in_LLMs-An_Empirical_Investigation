The scent of rain-soaked parchment clung to Amelia Blackwood's worn cardigan as she sat in her attic study, overlooking the cobbled streets of Edinburgh. Rain lashed against the mullioned windows, mimicking the relentless tapping of her fingers against the antique typewriter, its brass keys reflecting the flickering gaslight. 

A draft whistled through a gap in the window frame, sending shivers down Amelia's spine. She pulled her cardigan tighter, its wool scratching against the faded ink stains on her forearms – remnants of countless manuscripts that had found their way out of this very room and into the world. But tonight, the words wouldn’t come. 

Amelia Blackwood, once a rising star in the literary scene, now found herself adrift in a sea of writer's block. The pressure to produce another bestseller was suffocating, the weight of expectation a leaden shroud around her creative spirit. Outside, the storm raged on, mirroring the tempest within her own mind.
