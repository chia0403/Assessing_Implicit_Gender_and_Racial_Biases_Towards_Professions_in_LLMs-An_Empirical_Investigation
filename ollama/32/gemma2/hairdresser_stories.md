The bell above the door chimed its usual cheerful melody, but Penelope "Penny" Featherstonehaugh barely registered it. Her focus was laser-sharp on the auburn cascade before her, expertly weaving strands into intricate braids while simultaneously offering words of encouragement to Ms. Higgins, whose 80th birthday party loomed large this weekend.

The salon, aptly named “Feather & Flair,” buzzed with its usual Saturday morning hum. The scent of lavender shampoo mingled with the faint aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the nervous whispers of clients anticipating their transformations. Sunlight streamed through the large front window, casting rainbows across the polished wooden floor where stray strands of hair danced like fallen leaves. 

Penny adjusted Ms. Higgins’s floral headband, her movements as practiced and precise as a surgeon’s. She glanced at the reflection in the mirror, catching her own tired eyes beneath her usual bright smile. Another busy day, another dozen dreams sculpted with shears and color. But today felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickling sensation on her skin - like something was about to change.
