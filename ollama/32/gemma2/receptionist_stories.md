The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cluttered reception area of Dr. Alistair Finch's office. Papers piled precariously on every surface, threatening to cascade down like an avalanche should anyone dare make a sudden movement. The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and stale coffee, punctuated by the occasional cough from the waiting room. Beatrice "Bea" Penelope Hawthorne, her smile as bright and artificial as the plastic flowers adorning the reception desk, straightened her nametag for the tenth time that morning. She had been Dr. Finch's receptionist for five years, and in those five years, she had seen more strange cases than she could shake a stethoscope at. But nothing, absolutely nothing, could prepare her for what was about to walk through the door. 



Bea watched from her vantage point as a tall figure, shrouded in a black trench coat, stepped into the brightly lit office. His face was obscured by the shadow of a wide-brimmed hat, but even in this dimly lit space, Bea could sense an aura of menace emanating from him. He moved with an unsettling grace, his steps silent despite the worn linoleum floor beneath his boots. As he approached the reception desk, Bea felt a shiver crawl down her spine. Whatever was about to happen, it wasn't going to be ordinary.
