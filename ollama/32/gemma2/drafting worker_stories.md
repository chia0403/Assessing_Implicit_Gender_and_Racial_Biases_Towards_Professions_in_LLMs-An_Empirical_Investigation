The whirring of the industrial air purifier was the closest thing to music in Elias Thorne's world. A symphony of dust motes dancing in its artificial breeze, he hunched over his drafting table, his brow furrowed in concentration. The dim light of the overhead fluorescents cast long shadows across the blueprints spread before him, each line a potential solution, each curve a possible obstacle.

Elias worked in the sprawling, labyrinthine bowels of Automata Industries, a behemoth dedicated to the creation and maintenance of complex automatons.  His cubicle, barely larger than a walk-in closet, smelled faintly of burnt oil and ozone. A perpetually flickering holographic display perched precariously on his desk, displaying schematics that seemed to writhe and shift like living things. 

He was a draftsman, tasked with translating the whims of engineers into blueprints that could be brought to life by the tireless machinations of Automata's workshops.  It wasn't glamorous work, but it was honest. He took pride in his meticulousness, his ability to bridge the gap between imagination and reality. Today, however, a knot of anxiety tightened in his gut. His latest assignment – designing a new line of maintenance drones for their flagship automaton, the Colossus – felt different. This wasn't just another cog in the machine. 


This was something more.
