The late afternoon sun bled through the dusty glass panes of the Grand Bellini Hotel's lobby, painting long stripes across the faded Persian rugs. The air hung thick with the scent of lilies from the overflowing vase on reception and the lingering aroma of stale cigarettes from the smokers huddled in their designated corner. 

Behind the grand mahogany desk, Bartholomew "Bart" Wellington adjusted his pristine white gloves. A lifetime spent catering to the whims of the city's elite had rendered him an expert in reading people – a skill honed by years of deciphering the subtlest of frowns and furrowed brows. He could tell, with a practiced glance, that Mrs. Van Der Snoot, perched like a porcelain doll on a velvet settee, was unhappy about something, though what exactly was lost behind the veil of her carefully applied rouge.  

His eyes drifted towards the clock ticking ominously on the wall. Six p.m. – time for his daily ritual: a quiet gin and tonic in the dimly lit staff room, a sanctuary from the incessant demands and manufactured smiles of the Grand Bellini’s guests. Until then, Bart would continue to navigate the intricate dance of service, ensuring that each guest, however demanding or absurd, felt like royalty within the gilded cage of his hotel.
