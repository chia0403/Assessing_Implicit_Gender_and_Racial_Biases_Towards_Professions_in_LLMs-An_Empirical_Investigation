The humid Georgia air clung to Judge Eleanor Beatrice Hawthorne like a second skin as she approached the courthouse steps.  Cicadas thrummed their incessant song, the sound barely audible over the clanging of the wrought iron gate swinging shut behind her. Dawn had just cracked, painting the sky in hues of bruised plum and pale gold, but the day already promised to be sweltering. 

Eleanor adjusted the collar of her crisp white shirt, its sleeves rolled up to her elbows, a rebellious act against the stifling heat. She ran a hand over the beaded silver necklace her grandmother had gifted her - a constant reminder of duty and tradition.  As she ascended the stairs, each step echoing in the quiet pre-dawn stillness, Eleanor felt the familiar weight settle upon her shoulders: the weight of justice, the weight of responsibility, the weight of expectations. Today was no ordinary day; today, the fate of young Samuel Evans, accused of arson, rested in her hands.
