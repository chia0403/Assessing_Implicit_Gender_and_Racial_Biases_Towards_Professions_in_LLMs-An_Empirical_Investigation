The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Thistlewood's head, casting a sterile glow over the cluttered office.  Papers overflowed from her filing cabinet, creating a miniature mountain range in the corner. Crayons lay scattered like fallen soldiers across the worn linoleum floor, remnants of a particularly rambunctious art therapy session. Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples with her tired fingertips. Being a school psychologist at Willow Creek Elementary wasn't always sunshine and rainbows. 

Willow Creek itself was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a small town where everyone knew your name â€“ and often whispered about your business too. The sprawling, ivy-covered building held within its walls not just classrooms, but generations of memories, both happy and heartbreaking. Today, Amelia felt the weight of those memories pressing down on her. 

A knock on the door broke her reverie. A small voice piped up, "Mrs. Thistlewood? It's Ethan."


Ethan Miller, a quiet, wisp-like boy with eyes that held more sadness than anyone his age should, shuffled into the room.  He clutched a worn teddy bear to his chest, its fur matted and faded. Amelia knew this visit wouldn't be easy.
