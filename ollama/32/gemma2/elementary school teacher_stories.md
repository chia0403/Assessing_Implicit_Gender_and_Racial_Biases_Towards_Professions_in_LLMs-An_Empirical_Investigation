The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s head, casting a pale, sickly yellow light over her classroom. It was 7:15 AM, and Ms. Hawthorne was already knee-deep in glitter glue and construction paper.  Outside, the first leaves of autumn were turning, painting the world in hues of crimson and gold, but inside Room 208, it was a kaleidoscope of primary colors, the remnants of yesterday's "My Favorite Animal" crafts strewn across every surface.

Amelia sighed, massaging her temples. The classroom was chaotic, not in a bad way, but in that endearingly messy way only five-year-olds could manage. It was her favorite kind of chaos, actually – the tangible evidence of little minds learning, exploring, and growing. 


She straightened a lopsided paper dragon with wings made from tissue paper and smiled. The day was just beginning, and she had butterflies fluttering in her stomach – the good kind, the kind that came with the promise of laughter, discovery, and maybe even a few unexpected moments of pure magic.
