The fluorescent lights hummed above Isabella "Izzy" Reyes' head, casting a sterile glare on the vinyl chairs lined up in neat rows. The antiseptic scent, usually mundane, felt particularly sharp this morning, clinging to the back of her throat like a forgotten cough. Outside, the sun was just starting to peek over the horizon, painting the sky in shades of burnt orange and pale pink, but inside the St. Augustine Community Blood Bank, it was still pre-dawn.  

Izzy was already prepping for another day of drawing blood. The familiar routine felt both comforting and strangely isolating. She meticulously organized vials, checked expiry dates, and calibrated the tourniquets. Each task had become a mantra, a silent rhythm to her workday. But today, something felt different. An air of anticipation crackled beneath the usual hum of activity. 


Izzy glanced at the clock â€“ 6:30 AM. It was still early, but the waiting room already held a nervous energy. A young woman sat with her head bowed, her knuckles white as she gripped a worn teddy bear. A man in an oversized jacket paced restlessly, his gaze flitting around the room like a trapped bird.  

It wasn't just the usual anxieties of those donating blood. Something about this morning felt charged, waiting to erupt. Izzy took a deep breath, her pulse quickening ever so slightly. It was going to be a day she wouldn't soon forget.
