The humid New Orleans air hung thick with the scent of jasmine and stale beer as Amelia Katherine Dubois surveyed the scene before her. A symphony of car horns blared from Bourbon Street, a cacophony punctuated by the occasional shriek of laughter and the soulful wail of a blues guitarist.

She belonged amidst rolling hills of California wine country, where sun-drenched days gave way to star-studded nights, not these humid, shadowed streets teeming with life and desperation. But here she was, her latest film project - a gritty neo-noir about a jaded detective battling the demons of his past - demanding its attention in the heart of this city that oozed secrets like spilled liquor.
