The scent of fresh linen and beeswax hung heavy in the air, mingling with the tang of pipe tobacco that clung to Elias Alistair Finch's tweed coat. Outside, London thrummed with the pre-dawn energy of horse-drawn carriages rattling over cobblestones and the distant bleating of sheep heading to market. Inside his workshop on Swallow Street, however, time seemed to move slower, governed by the rhythmic snip of shears and the steady whirring of his treadle sewing machine.  Elias, a man built like a sturdy oak with hands that could coax miracles from even the most stubborn fabric, was hunched over a bolt of midnight blue velvet, its depths swirling with silver threads. He was crafting a gown for Lady Eleanor Ashworth, a woman known for her impeccable taste and even more impeccable disdain for anything less than perfection. This dress, Elias knew, had to be flawless. 


He paused, pressing his thumb against the velvet's smooth surface. A shiver ran through him, not from the chill seeping in through the drafty workshop window, but from a sudden, inexplicable sense of foreboding. It was an unsettling feeling, one he couldn't quite place, like a discordant note in a carefully composed melody.
