The rain hammered against the cracked windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office, mimicking the insistent drumming in his head.

Outside, the neon signs of Bleaker Street flickered, casting a sickly yellow light onto the rain-slicked asphalt. 

Bart Quill was used to darkness, both literal and figurative.
