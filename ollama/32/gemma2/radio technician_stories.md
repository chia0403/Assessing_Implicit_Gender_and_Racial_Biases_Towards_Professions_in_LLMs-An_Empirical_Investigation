The humid air clung to Elsie Mae Peabody like a damp blanket as she knelt beside the crackling radios, their metal cases warm beneath her calloused fingertips. The station’s cramped attic studio in rural Pine Ridge, Mississippi, was lit by a single flickering bulb hanging precariously from a frayed wire, casting long shadows that danced across dusty equipment and faded posters of country music stars. 

The air crackled with static, punctuated by bursts of garbled voices and the occasional mournful wail of a train whistle carried on the AM band. Elsie Mae squinted at the dials, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tried to isolate the source of the interference. Her fingers, stained with graphite from years of tinkering, nimbly adjusted potentiometers and capacitors, hoping to coax a clearer signal from the unruly wires.  

Elsie Mae was known throughout Pine Ridge for her ability to fix anything electronic, from broken toasters to malfunctioning televisions. But lately, something had been off. The interference on the radios had grown worse, whispering cryptic messages in code that she couldn’t decipher. And sometimes, in the quiet hours after sunset, she swore she heard voices – faint, disembodied voices calling out her name.
