The flickering neon sign of the Rusty Spigot cast an oily rainbow across Amelia Celeste’s trench coat as she hunched over her worn notepad. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the bar, drumming out a rhythm that mirrored the anxious beat of her own heart.  

Amelia wasn't here for the lukewarm beer or the stale cigarette smoke. She was here because whispers had reached her about a man with secrets, a man who frequented this dive bar tucked away on the edge of New Orleans’ French Quarter. His name, she was told, was Gabriel Moreau, and he knew something about the unsolved disappearance of Clara Dubois – a case that had haunted Amelia for months.


The humid air inside the Rusty Spigot hung thick with the scent of stale bourbon and desperation. The bar itself was dimly lit, its worn wooden counters scarred with countless stories etched into their surface. A handful of regulars huddled in shadowy corners, nursing their drinks and avoiding eye contact with Amelia.  But Gabriel Moreau… he wasn't one to blend in. He sat alone at the end of the bar, a silhouette against the flickering light, his back ramrod straight, his gaze fixed on something beyond the grimy windowpane.

Amelia took a deep breath and squared her shoulders, ready to face whatever secrets this man held.
