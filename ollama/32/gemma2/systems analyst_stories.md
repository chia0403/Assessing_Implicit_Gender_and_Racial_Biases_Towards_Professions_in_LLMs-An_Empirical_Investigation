This wasn't just another bug fix; it threatened the very foundation of InnoTech’s reputation, built on delivering seamless, reliable software solutions.  The weight of responsibility pressed down on Amelia, but she thrived under pressure. Her analytical mind, honed by years of dissecting complex code, was her weapon against this digital demon.
