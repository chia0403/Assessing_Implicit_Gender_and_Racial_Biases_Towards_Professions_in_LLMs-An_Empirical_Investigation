The late afternoon sun slanted through the grimy windows of Ms. Amelia Juniper's cramped office, casting long shadows across her desk piled high with case files. Outside, the humid August air hung heavy over New Orleans, buzzing with cicadas and the distant wail of a police siren. 

Amelia sighed, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her braid. She ran a hand over the worn leather of her binder, its cover emblazoned with the words "Probation Department - City of NOLA." Her gaze fell on the file currently open: "Raymond 'Ray' Delacroix Jr., Case #23479."  It was his fifth offense â€“ petty theft this time, a pair of antique cufflinks stolen from a tourist shop.  

Amelia had a sinking feeling that Ray wasn't cut out for life outside the confines of prison. This case felt different, like a turning point in his trajectory. A knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach as she reached for her phone to schedule his meeting.
