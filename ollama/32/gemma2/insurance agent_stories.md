The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne like a damp shroud as she stepped out of her Ford Focus. Her stilettos sunk slightly into the soft gravel of Mrs. Delacroix’s driveway, leaving two tiny impressions in the dusty earth. The late afternoon sun beat down on Amelia’s shoulders, making her linen blouse stick uncomfortably to her back.  

Amelia adjusted her designer sunglasses and took a deep breath. This wasn’t exactly the type of day she’d pictured for herself when she’d landed the coveted position at Hawthorne & Sons Insurance. No ocean breezes, no glamorous cocktail parties with wealthy clients. Just a sweltering summer afternoon spent in a run-down suburb, trying to sell homeowners insurance to a woman who clearly didn’t want to talk to her. 


Mrs. Delacroix was known for being difficult –  unpredictable and prone to sudden outbursts. Amelia suspected she'd inherited that trait from her famous actress daughter, who had once threatened to sue the company for denying a claim on a "magical" tapestry stolen by fairies. Today, Amelia hoped to avoid a repeat performance.
