The sun hadn't yet crested the ragged peaks of the Bitterroot Mountains when Jebediah "Jeb" Caldwell kicked open the stable door. The air was crisp with the promise of frost, carrying the scent of pine needles and damp earth. A thin layer of mist clung to the valley floor, shrouding the sprawling fields of his family ranch in an ethereal veil. 

Jeb ran a hand through his grizzled beard, squinting at the rising sun. Another day on the Caldwell Ranch, another day wrestling with the whims of nature and the stubbornness of cattle. He glanced towards the weathered barn, its wooden timbers groaning under the weight of years and countless storms. This land was in his blood, each furrow etched by generations before him, their sweat and sacrifice woven into the very fabric of the earth.

He breathed deeply, the familiar scent grounding him, reminding him of who he was â€“ a rancher, born and bred, with the calloused hands and weathered face to prove it. 


The Bitterroot Ranch, nestled deep in the heart of Montana, was Jeb's entire world. It was his legacy, his responsibility, and the one place he truly felt at home.
