The air hung thick with the sweet scent of coconut oil and lavender shampoo as Elara Beatrice Beaumont adjusted the purple silk scarf draped around her neck. Sunlight streamed through the dusty storefront window, casting long shadows across the mismatched chairs that lined the waiting area. A chipped porcelain vase held a bouquet of wilting sunflowers, their heads bowed in defeat like tired dancers after a long performance. 

Elara sighed, smoothing down the wrinkles on her crisp white uniform. It was always quiet this early. The salon, "Beaumont's Beauty & Bravery," wasn't exactly booming yet. After all, it was only open for a few weeks now and nestled between a laundromat and a dusty antique shop in the less-than-trendy part of Willow Creek. But Elara had dreams – big, beautiful, glitter-bomb dreams - and she wouldn't let a few wilting sunflowers and an empty waiting room dim her sparkle. 


Today, however, even Elara couldn’t shake the feeling of unease that clung to the air like morning mist. It was more than just the usual pre-opening jitters; there was something else in the silence, something unseen, waiting…watching.
