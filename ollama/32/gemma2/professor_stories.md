The wind howled like a banshee outside Professor Eleanor Ainsworth's window, rattling the panes of the old Victorian house she shared with her equally eccentric cat, Edgar Allan. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the view of the ancient oaks that lined the drive leading up to their secluded home on the moors of Yorkshire. Inside, the only light came from the flickering flames of a log fire, casting dancing shadows across Eleanor's cluttered desk, piled high with books, manuscripts, and half-eaten packets of digestive biscuits. 

Eleanor, her silver hair pulled back in a loose bun, hunched over a leather-bound volume, its pages illuminated by the pale glow of a vintage lamp. She was engrossed in deciphering an ancient Sumerian tablet, its cuneiform script whispering secrets from millennia past. Her fingers, weathered and stained with ink, traced the intricate symbols, her brow furrowed in concentration. 

Suddenly, a deafening crack split the night.  Eleanor jumped, startled, nearly spilling her steaming mug of Earl Grey tea. Edgar Allan hissed from his perch on the windowsill, his emerald eyes fixed on the storm raging outside. The house shuddered, and another crash echoed through the halls. This wasn't just wind, something else was out thereâ€¦
