The smell of bay rum and sandalwood clung to Bartholomew “Bart” Finch like a second skin. It was a familiar comfort in his small barbershop on Maple Street, tucked between a dusty antique store and a bakery that perpetually smelled of sugar and yeast. 

Sunbeams slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes dancing in the air, each one catching the golden light like a tiny jewel. Bart ran a hand over his neatly trimmed beard, the weight of the vintage clippers warm in his palm. His shop was old, its mahogany shelves groaning under the weight of antique shaving mugs and rusted straight razors, but there was a quiet charm to it, a rhythm to the day that had been playing out for decades.  

He heard the familiar jingle of the bell above the door before he even saw him. It was Mr. Henderson, his usual Monday morning client, shuffling in with a sigh, clutching his newspaper like a shield against the world. 


Bart smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. "Morning, Mr. Henderson," he said, already reaching for a towel and setting up his tools. 

"Mornin', Bart," Mr. Henderson mumbled, sinking into the worn leather barber's chair with a groan.  “Another week starts.”
