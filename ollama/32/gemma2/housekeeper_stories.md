The scent of lavender clung to Amelia Celeste Bellweather's apron like a stubborn ghost, a reminder of Mrs. Haverford's obsession with all things flowery and frivolous.  Amelia preferred the earthy smell of polished wood and beeswax, the silent comfort of order achieved in a meticulously dusted corner. She liked things precise, predictable, safe. 

The grand old Victorian house perched on the cliffside, shrouded in perpetual fog, was anything but safe. It whispered secrets through the floorboards and sighed with the weight of its history. Each creaking step Amelia took echoed the ghosts that supposedly haunted its halls, stories Mrs. Haverford spun with theatrical glee over a cup of Earl Grey tea. 

Today, however, the house seemed unusually quiet, even for a Monday morning. The only sounds were the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the hall and the mournful moan of the wind outside. Amelia straightened her spine, tucked a stray strand of brown hair behind her ear, and began her rounds, leaving a trail of lavender-laced silence in her wake.
