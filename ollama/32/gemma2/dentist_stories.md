The stale scent of antiseptic hung heavy in Dr. Eloise Beaumont's office, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of blood that always seemed to cling to her tools. Outside, a storm raged, wind howling like a banshee and rain lashing against the windows of her small, brick building nestled on a quiet street corner in Maplewood. It was the kind of night that kept most people huddled inside, but Eloise preferred the solitude it brought, a welcome escape from the constant chatter and demands of her patients. 

She glanced at the clock: 7:45 pm. Her office hours officially ended at 6, but tonight, like most nights, she'd stayed late, caught in the familiar trance of meticulous cleaning and precise drilling.  A flicker of movement outside caught her eye. A lone figure stood on the opposite side of the street, silhouetted against the lightning flashes. It was a young man, hunched over as if sheltering from the wind, his face obscured by the shadow of his hood. Eloise frowned, wondering who would be out in this weather, particularly at this hour.
