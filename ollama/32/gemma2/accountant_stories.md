The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's head like a chorus of disgruntled bees, their buzzing a constant reminder of the endless spreadsheets stretching across her computer screen.  Outside her office window, London sweltered under a late summer sun, but inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. It was tax season, the bane of Amelia's existence, a relentless torrent of invoices, receipts, and deductions that threatened to consume her entire being. 

Amelia sighed, rubbing her weary eyes. She longed for the crisp autumn air, for walks through Hyde Park with the scent of fallen leaves, for evenings spent curled up with a good book and a cup of tea. But for now, she was trapped in this cubicle, her only companions a calculator that clicked rhythmically like a metronome counting down to her inevitable breakdown and a stack of tax forms threatening to topple over like a Jenga tower of doom.
