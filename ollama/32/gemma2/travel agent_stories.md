The aroma of stale coffee mingled with the faint scent of jasmine from the potted plant perched precariously on the windowsill. Sunlight streamed through dusty glass, illuminating motes dancing in the air above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's desk. Papers – itineraries, brochures, reservation confirmations – formed a haphazard mosaic across its surface. 

Amelia, her silvering hair pulled back in a loose bun, sighed and rubbed her temples. The morning rush had been brutal; honeymooners wanting Santorini under a cloudless sky, families seeking adventure in the wilds of Patagonia, a solitary businessman yearning for the anonymity of Tokyo's neon-drenched streets.  Each dream was unique, each desire specific, yet they all landed on Amelia's desk, their hopes and anxieties wrapped in the thin paper veil of a travel inquiry.

This wasn't how she envisioned her retirement. She'd dreamt of sunrises over turquoise waters, lazy afternoons spent reading beneath swaying palms, perhaps even learning to paint watercolors in Provence. Instead, here she was, surrounded by maps and brochures, the echoes of wanderlust ringing hollow in her own heart.


But then, a new email popped up on her screen. The subject line simply read: "Escape." 
Amelia clicked it open, a flicker of curiosity igniting within her weary soul. This wasn't just another mundane request. This was different. This was... intriguing.
