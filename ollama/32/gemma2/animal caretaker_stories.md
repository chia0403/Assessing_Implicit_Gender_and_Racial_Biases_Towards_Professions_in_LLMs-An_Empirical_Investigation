The smell of damp hay and pungent manure hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elara Willowbrook’s worn leather boots like an unwelcome shadow. A rooster crowed somewhere in the distance, its call swallowed by the mist swirling around the sprawling, rambling barn. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky with streaks of pale pink and lavender over the rolling green hills that cradled Willow Creek Farm.

Elara, a wisp of a girl with sun-kissed cheeks and eyes as green as the spring grass, trudged through the mud-slicked floorboards. Her hands, calloused from years of tending to animals, were already reaching for the worn bucket hanging from her hip, preparing for the day's ritual: feeding the resident menagerie. 

She was the heart and soul of Willow Creek, a solitary guardian to its mismatched collection of rescued creatures – a one-eyed donkey named Patches, a flock of clucking hens with personalities as big as their wattles, and a grumpy old goat named Bartholomew who had a particular fondness for Elara’s boots.  She knew each animal by name, understood their quirks and fears, and loved them fiercely. But today, a feeling of unease gnawed at her like a persistent itch. Something was different, off-kilter in the familiar rhythm of the farm.
