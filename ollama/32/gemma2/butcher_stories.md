The air hung thick with the metallic tang of blood and the earthy aroma of sawdust in Bartholomew "Bart" Cleaver's shop. Dawn was just breaking, casting long, skeletal shadows across the worn linoleum floor as Bart meticulously honed his cleavers against a whetstone, the rhythmic rasp cutting through the pre-dawn silence. Outside, the city of Grimsborough stirred, its cobbled streets soon to be teeming with people on their way to work and markets. But inside "Cleaver's Cuts," time seemed to move slower, measured by the patient swing of the cleavers and the gentle thudding of meat being weighed on the ancient brass scales. 

Grimsborough itself was a town of contrasts â€“ cobbled streets lined with centuries-old houses jostling for space with newly erected brick buildings, a mix of old money clinging to its traditions and a growing class of merchants eager for a piece of the expanding trade routes. It was a place where secrets were as common as rain, whispered in hushed tones over steaming mugs of ale in dimly lit pubs, or etched into the faces of weathered townsfolk who had seen generations come and go. And Bartholomew Cleaver, with his quiet demeanor and keen eyes, knew every secret the town held, hidden beneath layers of flesh and bone just like the stories themselves.
