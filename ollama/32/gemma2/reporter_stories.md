The humid Georgia air clung to Amelia Grace Carter like a second skin as she pushed through the bustling farmers market. The scent of peaches mingled with the earthy aroma of freshly tilled soil, a symphony of summer that usually soothed her nerves. Today, however, it did little to quell the storm brewing inside her. 


Amelia,  a reporter for the Savannah Chronicle, was on deadline. Her editor, a man known for his iron fist and even tighter deadlines, had tasked her with finding a story about the increasingly strange occurrences plaguing the historic district. Whispers of phantom footsteps in cobblestone alleys, spectral figures glimpsed in antique shops, and unexplained cold spots in centuries-old homes were circulating amongst the locals. 

The farmers market, a melting pot of eccentric personalities and colorful characters, was Amelia's best chance to uncover some truth behind the town’s eerie rumors.  She scanned the crowd, hoping for a spark, a glint in someone's eye that hinted at knowledge, or perhaps even fear. Savannah, with its rich history and lingering shadows, held secrets – secrets Amelia was determined to unearth. 


The sun beat down on her neck as she approached an old woman selling hand-knitted scarves. The woman’s face, a roadmap of wrinkles etched by time and sun, seemed to crinkle deeper as Amelia approached. Perhaps this woman, with her eyes that held the weight of generations past, knew something about the ghostly whispers haunting Savannah.
