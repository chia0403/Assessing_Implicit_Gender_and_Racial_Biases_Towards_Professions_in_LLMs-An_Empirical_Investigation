The scent of freshly-brewed Earl Grey and lilies hung heavy in the air, doing little to mask the underlying aroma of despair emanating from the living room.  It wasn’t the chipped porcelain vase, the faded floral wallpaper, or even the dust motes dancing in the weak morning sunlight that spoke of sadness; it was the way the furniture seemed huddled together, as if afraid of being left alone.

Eleanor Adelaide Finch, perched on a worn velvet armchair, surveyed the scene with the practiced eye of a seasoned interior decorator. Her pencil tapped rhythmically against her notepad, a counterpoint to the ticking clock on the mantlepiece.  This wasn’t just another job for Ellie – fixing up homes, injecting personality into spaces, and helping people rediscover joy in their surroundings. This was personal.

The house belonged to Mrs. Beatrice Winthrop, Ellie's beloved grandmother, who had retreated within its walls after the passing of her husband, George. It hadn't been long, but the silence had already begun to echo with emptiness. The once vibrant space felt choked by grief, and Ellie knew it was time for a change.  

The setting sun cast long shadows across the overgrown garden, where rose bushes, neglected for months, drooped like weary mourners. Inside, the air held a chill despite the crackling fire in the hearth. This wasn't just a house; it was a monument to memories, both happy and heartbreaking. And Ellie was determined to transform it into a sanctuary again, a place where her grandmother could find solace amidst the echoes of loss.
