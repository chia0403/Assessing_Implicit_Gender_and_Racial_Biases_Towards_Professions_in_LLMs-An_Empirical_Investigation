The flickering fluorescent lights of Gate 37 cast long, skeletal shadows across the departure lounge. A symphony of coughs, murmured conversations, and the rhythmic click-clack of rolling suitcases filled the air, a familiar soundtrack to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's life. She straightened her crisp blue uniform, adjusting the tiny silver wings pinned to her chest, feeling the weight of responsibility settle on her shoulders like a well-worn blanket. 

Amelia, known as "Rosie" by her colleagues, scanned the faces waiting at the gate for Flight 723 to Miami. A sea of anticipation and restless energy rippled through the crowd – honeymooners holding hands, nervous business travelers clutching their laptops, families with children bouncing off the walls. Each passenger carried a story, a destination, a secret yearning. And Rosie, with her decades of experience navigating the skies, had become a silent witness to them all. 


Today, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced on the back of her neck, a sense that something was just out of place. The air itself seemed thicker, charged with an unspoken tension that lingered even after the boarding call was announced.  Amelia took a deep breath, pushing aside the creeping feeling. It was probably just pre-flight jitters, she told herself. She had faced storms, turbulence, and even the occasional unruly passenger – this was nothing new. But as she led the passengers onto the plane, her gaze lingered on a solitary figure waiting at the back of the line. A man shrouded in shadow, his face obscured by the brim of a wide-brimmed hat. He met Amelia's eyes for a fleeting moment, a flicker of something cold and unreadable passing through them. 

A shiver ran down Rosie's spine. This flight was about to take on an unexpected turn.
