The stale scent of burnt coffee mingled with the metallic tang of blood clung to Dr. Eleanor Vance like a second skin. Outside her office window in the dimly lit wing of the Baltimore City morgue, the storm raged, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the city lights into an oily smear, casting flickering shadows across the autopsy table where Detective Miller was meticulously cataloging the victim's wounds. 

Eleanor wasn't a fan of these scenes â€“ the raw brutality of death always left her feeling hollowed out. Yet, here she was, staring at the lifeless body of a young woman, her vibrant auburn hair now matted with blood, her eyes forever closed in silent terror. The victim's identity remained unknown, another nameless soul lost to the city's underbelly. 

Her job wasn't to grieve for the deceased; it was to understand the monster who had taken them.  Eleanor Vance, forensic psychologist extraordinaire, was about to delve into the twisted mind of the killer lurking in the shadows, hoping to unravel the secrets hidden beneath a veil of violence.
