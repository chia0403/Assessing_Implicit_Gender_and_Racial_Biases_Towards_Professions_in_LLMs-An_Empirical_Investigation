The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aethelred, carrying with it the sting of snow and the whispers of forgotten battles.  Sergeant Elara Stormbreaker pulled her fur-lined cloak tighter around her, the rough wool offering little solace against the relentless cold. Her breath plumed out in white puffs, each exhale a tiny rebellion against the vast, uncaring expanse that stretched before her. The Watchtower of Cinderstone, a solitary sentinel against the encroaching darkness, loomed over the plains like a brooding giant. Its stone walls, weathered and scarred from centuries of harsh storms and skirmishes with the nomadic tribes of the north, held firm against the elements as Elara approached its crenellated ramparts. 


A lone wolf howled in the distance, its mournful cry echoing across the frozen wasteland.  It was a sound that spoke of loneliness and hardship, a melody familiar to any soul who dared to stand guard on the edge of civilization. Elara knew that sound well. It had become the soundtrack to her life, a constant reminder of the precarious balance between order and chaos that she, and the other members of the Aethelred Watch, struggled to maintain. 


As she reached the gate, its heavy iron bars groaning in protest as they swung open, Elara felt the weight of responsibility settle upon her shoulders like an anvil. It was a weight she bore with stoic acceptance, her gaze unwavering as she looked out at the unforgiving landscape. For Sergeant Elara Stormbreaker, duty was not just a word; it was a way of life.
