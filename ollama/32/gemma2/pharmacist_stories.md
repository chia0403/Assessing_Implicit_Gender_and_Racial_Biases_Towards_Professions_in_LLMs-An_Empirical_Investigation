The scent of lavender hand sanitizer and dusty medical textbooks hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Amelia Grace Hawthorne as she unlocked the shop door. Outside, the late August sun beat down on Willow Creek, baking the asphalt streets and turning the world into shimmering heat waves. Inside, her apothecary, "Hawthorne's Remedies," remained refreshingly cool, a haven from the day’s oppressive warmth. 

Amelia surveyed the shelves stocked with jars of dried herbs, neatly labeled bottles of tinctures, and homemade soaps with names like "Sleepy Time Lavender" and "Energizing Citrus." A bell tinkled softly as she stepped inside, the sound echoing through the quiet shop. The air was thick with anticipation; it was the day before Willow Creek's annual Harvest Festival, and Amelia knew her little apothecary would be buzzing come morning.  

But for now, it was just her, the comforting scent of chamomile tea brewing on the stove, and the lingering mystery of a strange new prescription that had arrived earlier in the week, addressed to "The Patient." It wasn't signed by a doctor, nor did it include any identifying information beyond a vague request for “something potent.” Amelia frowned, setting down her satchel. Whoever this Patient was, they certainly knew how to pique her curiosity.
