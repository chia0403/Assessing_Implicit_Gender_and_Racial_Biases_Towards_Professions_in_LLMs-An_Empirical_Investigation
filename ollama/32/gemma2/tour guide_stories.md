The humid air hung heavy over Amelia "Amy" Juniper's neck as she surveyed the throng of tourists gathered before her. They were an eclectic mix: sunburnt families with screaming children, stoic couples clutching selfie sticks, and lone backpackers sporting faded band t-shirts. Amy, her own brow damp with perspiration, adjusted the microphone clipped to her polo shirt and plastered on a smile that could rival the garishly bright hibiscus flowers blooming nearby.

The setting was the heart of Machu Picchu, the ancient Incan citadel perched high in the Andes Mountains of Peru. The ruins, shrouded in mist and legend, sprawled before them like a forgotten dream. Stone walls climbed towards the sky, their weathered surfaces whispering tales of a lost civilization.  A hawk screeched overhead, its cry echoing through the vast plaza where Amy stood, a lone figure amidst the eager crowd.

"Welcome to Machu Picchu," she announced, her voice amplified by the microphone, "a place that has captivated imaginations for centuries..."   


Amy took a deep breath, savoring the moment. This was what she lived for â€“ sharing the magic of this extraordinary place with others.  But today felt different, a prickle of unease running down her spine. Perhaps it was the way the shadows seemed longer than usual, or the unsettling silence that fell over the crowd as she spoke. Whatever it was, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
