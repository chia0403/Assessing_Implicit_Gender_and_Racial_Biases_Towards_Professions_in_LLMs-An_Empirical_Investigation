The biting wind whipped across Clara Evangeline Beaumont's face, stinging her cheeks raw. The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the endless plains in bruised purples and fiery oranges.  Clara, her calloused hand gripping the worn leather of the steering wheel, squinted at the road ahead. A ribbon of black winding its way through the skeletal remains of abandoned farms and rusting oil derricks. 

This stretch of Route 66, nicknamed "The Devil's Backbone" for its treacherous curves and unforgiving heat, was her least favorite part of the haul. It always seemed to amplify the loneliness that clung to her like a shadow. Clara wasn't one for company â€“ she preferred the silent hum of the engine and the rhythmic thump of the tires against asphalt to the clatter of human conversation. But even the comforting monotony couldn't mask the gnawing emptiness that settled in her gut when she crossed this stretch of desolate land.
