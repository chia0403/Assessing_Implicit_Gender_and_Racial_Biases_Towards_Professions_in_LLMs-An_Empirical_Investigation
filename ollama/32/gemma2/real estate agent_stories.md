The air in Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's vintage Chevrolet Bel Air hung heavy with the scent of lavender car freshener and impending rain.  She tapped her manicured nails on the steering wheel, impatiently eyeing the amber streetlights blurring past. A shiver ran down her spine despite the heat radiating from the dashboard. This was a bad neighborhood, even for a seasoned realtor like Amelia. 

Amelia parked in front of a dilapidated Victorian mansion draped in shadows and overgrown ivy. The once grand structure now sagged precariously, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin.  This was her final appointment of the day, and frankly, she'd rather be sipping champagne on her balcony overlooking the city lights. But desperate clients often demanded desperate measures. This particular client, a woman with haunted eyes and whispers of dark secrets, had insisted on viewing this house at dusk. 

Amelia took a deep breath, adjusted her perfectly sculpted bob, and stepped out into the gathering gloom. The air felt charged, electric even, as if the very walls of the house were holding their breath. This wasn't just another property sale; it felt like entering a forbidden world.
