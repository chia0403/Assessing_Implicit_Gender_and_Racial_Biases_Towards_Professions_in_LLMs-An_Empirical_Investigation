The sticky scent of maple syrup clung to the air in Ms. Amelia Everly’s classroom. It wasn't unusual; Saturday mornings at Tiny Treasures daycare were pancake day, and the aroma always seemed to permeate every nook and cranny, even after the last plate was cleared. Amelia surveyed her domain: a jungle gym draped in colorful streamers, a half-deflated balloon animal teetering precariously on the bookshelf, and a scattered mess of crayons and playdough.  

Tiny Treasures wasn't exactly what you'd call upscale. The building was a converted bungalow with peeling paint and creaky floorboards, but it held a certain charm that Amelia couldn't deny. It was here, amidst the chaos and laughter, that she found her purpose. Being a child care worker wasn’t just a job for Amelia; it was a calling. She thrived on the energy of the children, their boundless curiosity, and their unyielding belief in magic. But today, something felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, even amidst the usual morning cacophony. 


Amelia adjusted her glasses, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her ponytail. Her gaze landed on Lily, a shy girl with wide blue eyes, who was quietly clutching her teddy bear and staring intently at the doorway. A shiver ran down Amelia's spine. It wasn’t the usual pre-naptime jitters; there was something deeper in Lily's expression, something that whispered of an unspoken fear.
