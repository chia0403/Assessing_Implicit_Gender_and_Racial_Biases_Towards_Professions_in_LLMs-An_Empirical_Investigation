The city lights below were blurred streaks of gold and crimson, swallowed whole by the storm brewing over Chicago.

She had poured years of her life into this project, sacrificing sleep, relationships, even her own sanity. Now, with the deadline looming and the storm raging outside, the weight of responsibility felt crushing.
