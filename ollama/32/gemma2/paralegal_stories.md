The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia Beatrice Carter's meticulously organized desk. Papers, neatly stacked in color-coded folders, formed a miniature cityscape on her workspace. Outside, rain lashed against the windows of the small legal firm, drumming a steady rhythm that mirrored the anxious beat of Amelia’s heart.

She wasn’t a lawyer, not by any stretch, but as the firm's lone paralegal, she was often thrust into positions far beyond her title.  She knew Mr. Henderson had high expectations, and this case – involving allegations of stolen vineyard secrets and a potentially multi-million dollar lawsuit – felt like it could make or break their small firm. 


As Amelia began sifting through the latest files, a sliver of unease crept in. The Golden Goose Winery case wasn't just about spilled wine and broken contracts; there was something deeper, darker lurking beneath the surface, something that made her stomach churn with premonition.
