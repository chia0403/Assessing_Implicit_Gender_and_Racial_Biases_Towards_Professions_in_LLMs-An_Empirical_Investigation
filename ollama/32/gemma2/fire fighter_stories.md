The acrid scent of smoke clung to Elias "Eli" Vance like a second skin.  He couldn't remember a time when it hadn't been a constant companion, woven into the fabric of his life like the faded red and yellow stripes on his fire engine boots. Eli had grown up with the clatter of sirens and the roar of flames; the firehouse was more home than any brick-and-mortar dwelling ever could be. 

He stood now on a street corner in downtown New Haven, Connecticut, bathed in the sickly orange glow spilling from a burning bakery across the road. Flames licked greedily at the sky, painting the night with grotesque shadows that danced along the brick facades of the surrounding buildings.  A cacophony of screams and shouts filled the air, mingling with the mournful wail of sirens approaching in the distance. The heat pressed against Eli's face like a furnace blast, but he didn't flinch. This was his element, chaos contained within the boundaries of duty and courage. 


This was where Eli Vance belonged.
