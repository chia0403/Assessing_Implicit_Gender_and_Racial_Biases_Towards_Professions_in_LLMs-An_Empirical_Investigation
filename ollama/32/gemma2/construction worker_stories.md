The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and sweat. Sweat that wasn't just from the work; the humidity in New Orleans clung to everything like a damp shroud, making each movement feel like wading through molasses. Silas "Si" Beaumont wiped his brow with a grimy handkerchief, his calloused hand leaving a streak across his already dusty face. He squinted at the half-built frame of the mansion rising before him, its intricate wrought iron balconies and regal columns promising a world of luxury far removed from Si's own humble existence.

Si wasn't meant for this life. Not really. He dreamt of open skies, wind whipping through his hair, not the suffocating stillness of the construction site. But dreams were cheap in New Orleans, easily traded for the next meal and a roof over his head. And besides, there was something strangely satisfying about taking raw materials and shaping them into something tangible, something that would stand long after he was gone. 


This particular mansion, though, felt different. Its grandeur seemed to mock him, a constant reminder of the gulf separating his world from theirs â€“ the world of wealth and privilege represented by the gleaming mahogany doors waiting to be installed. Today, Si was tasked with laying the foundation for the grand staircase, each brick a potential stepping stone towards a future he could barely imagine. He heaved another block into place, the thud echoing through the humid air, a small sound in the vast symphony of construction that filled his days.
