The air in Violet Willow's shop was thick with the scent of lilies and petrichor, a strange yet alluring combination that only a storm-soaked city afternoon could conjure. Rain lashed against the glass storefront, blurring the vibrant displays of roses, hydrangeas, and ferns within. Sunlight peeked through the clouds intermittently, casting dappled shadows on the polished floorboards, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.

Violet Willow, her name as delicate and fragrant as her creations, surveyed the scene with a sigh. The bell above the door tinkled, announcing another customer braving the downpour. She straightened her apron, a floral print that matched her shop's namesake perfectly, and turned to greet them.  But her smile faltered as she saw the man standing in the doorway, his face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and a frown etched deep into his brow. He looked out of place amongst the pastel pinks and sunny yellows, like a storm cloud himself amidst a field of wildflowers. 


"Welcome to Willow's Blooms," Violet said softly, hoping her voice held enough warmth to dispel the chill radiating from him.  "Can I help you find something?"
