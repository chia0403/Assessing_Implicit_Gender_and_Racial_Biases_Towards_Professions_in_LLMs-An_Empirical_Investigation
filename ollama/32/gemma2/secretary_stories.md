The insistent click-clack of Harriet Beatrice Thistlewick’s heels against the linoleum floor was the only sound in the otherwise hushed office. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky outside her window, casting long, pale fingers of light across the clutter on Mr. Fitzwilliam’s desk – a half-eaten croissant, a crumpled newspaper with a headline screaming about impending “Alien Contact”, and a coffee stain that had already taken root and begun its slow, inexorable journey into the woodgrain.  

Harriet straightened her beige pencil skirt, smoothing out the faint wrinkles that came with the constant motion of filing and answering phones. The air in the office was thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee, a perfume she’d come to associate with Mondays. She sighed, a quiet rustle in the stillness, and reached for the overflowing inbox. This one promised to be another long day. 


The setting is Mr. Fitzwilliam's small, cluttered office in a mid-century modern building on a busy city street.
