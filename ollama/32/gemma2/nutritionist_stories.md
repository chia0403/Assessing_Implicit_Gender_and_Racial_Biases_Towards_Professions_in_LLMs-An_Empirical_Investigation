The aroma of roasted garlic and rosemary hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of sanitiser that seemed to permeate every surface of Isabella "Izzy" Clementine's clinic. 

Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air.  Izzy surveyed her domain: a vibrant space crammed with plants, brightly coloured posters promoting healthy eating habits, and an impressive collection of cookbooks stacked on shelves that groaned under their weight. Despite the sunny disposition of the room, Izzy couldn't shake the feeling of unease. Her first client of the day was due to arrive any minute, a renowned chef notorious for his extravagant, calorie-laden creations, and Izzy had a sinking feeling this consultation wouldn't be your average "eat more greens" chat. 


This was The Nourishing Nest, tucked away in a quiet corner of bustling Melbourne, Australia. It was Izzy's haven, her sanctuary where she helped people rediscover the joy of wholesome food. But today, something felt different, a storm brewing beneath the surface of the cheerful decor.
