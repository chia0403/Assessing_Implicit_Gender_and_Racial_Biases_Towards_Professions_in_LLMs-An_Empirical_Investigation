The scent of antiseptic hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender from Amelia “Amy” Rosethorn’s essential oil diffuser. Sunlight streamed through the large windows of her therapy studio, casting warm rectangles across the polished wood floor. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves of the oak tree outside, creating a soothing melody that underscored the soft whirring of the treadmill in the corner. Amy straightened her purple scrubs, adjusting the stethoscope around her neck before turning to greet her next patient.  He shuffled in, leaning heavily on his cane, a grimace etched across his face. 

“Morning, Mr. Evans,” Amy greeted warmly, her voice as bright and welcoming as the space itself. “Ready for another round?”


Mr. Evans sighed, the sound heavy with years of pain. "As ready as I'll ever be, Miss Rosethorn."  His eyes, though clouded by age, held a flicker of hope that she saw often in her patients – a longing to reclaim their lost mobility, to feel whole again.
