The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. Rain lashed against the windows of the ambulance, blurring the neon glow of the city lights into an impressionistic smear of colour. Inside, Amelia Grace Davenport, better known as Amy to her colleagues, wrestled with the gurney straps, securing the unconscious man beneath them.  

He was young, maybe early twenties, his face pale and slack, a thin trail of blood trickling from a gash on his forehead. A shard of glass protruded from his arm, glinting wickedly in the flashing red lights that illuminated the cramped space. Amy worked quickly, her movements precise and efficient, honed by years of dealing with life-or-death situations. This was routine for her, a symphony of adrenaline and calm practiced to perfection. But tonight, something felt different. The air crackled with an unseen tension, a sense of foreboding that prickled the hairs on the back of her neck.

As she flipped open his airway and checked his pulse, Amy caught sight of a tattoo peeking out from beneath the man's shirt sleeve: a single raven perched on a skull, its eyes glowing an unnerving crimson. A shiver ran down her spine. She had seen this before, in a dream, a fleeting image that felt strangely familiar yet utterly impossible.  

The city lights pulsed outside, mirroring the erratic beat of Amy's heart as she prepared for the unknown that awaited them at the hospital. 


This was no ordinary call. This was somethingâ€¦ else.
