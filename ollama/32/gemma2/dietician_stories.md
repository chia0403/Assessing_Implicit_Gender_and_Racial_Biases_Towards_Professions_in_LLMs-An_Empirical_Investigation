The aroma of roasted garlic and rosemary hung heavy in the air, competing with the sharp tang of disinfectant that clung to every surface of Amelia "Amy" Rose Hawthorne's office. Outside, the San Francisco fog rolled in like a silent predator, swallowing the Golden Gate Bridge whole. 

Inside her cozy corner space nestled above a bustling Vietnamese bakery, Amy meticulously prepared a plate for her next client – a hulking linebacker with a sweet tooth the size of the Bay itself. He was due any minute, and Amy fidgeted with the colorful napkin she'd chosen, patterned with adorable cartoon vegetables that seemed wildly inappropriate considering his dietary needs. A sigh escaped her lips as she glanced at the half-eaten kale smoothie in her own mug – the irony wasn't lost on her.  

Amy Hawthorne, dietician extraordinaire and champion of the healthy plate, was struggling to eat her way through a lunch of green goodness while dreaming about the warm, buttery aroma emanating from the bakery downstairs.
