The air hung thick with humidity and the smell of salt marsh as Amelia "Millie" Brighton wrestled a length of coax cable into its conduit. Sweat dripped from her brow, stinging her eyes, but Millie didn't flinch. She was used to working in these conditions -  the unforgiving heat of late August on the marshes bordering New Orleans was just another Tuesday for an electrician like her.

Her current project: restoring power to a dilapidated shrimping boat, "The Cajun Queen," which had been struck by lightning during the last storm. The old vessel sat in its slip, a rickety skeleton against the backdrop of the fiery Louisiana sunset. Rusty chains creaked and barnacles clung to its hull like ghostly memories, whispering tales of countless tides and weathered storms.

Millie tugged at the cable again, her frustration mounting.  She could hear the rhythmic slap of waves against the boat's side, a steady beat in the symphony of the marsh. 


"Damn it," she muttered under her breath, "This thing's as stubborn as a crawfish."
