The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the meticulously manicured lawns of Meadowbrook Cemetery, painting the headstones in hues of amber and rose. Bartholomew Thistlewick, or "Bart" as he preferred, hummed a jaunty tune as he swept fallen leaves into neat piles, his movements precise and efficient after decades spent tending to this hallowed ground.

Meadowbrook wasn't just Bart's workplace; it was a sanctuary. He knew the stories etched on each granite slab like the lines on his own weathered hands. He'd witnessed generations come and go, watched children grow into adults who returned with their own families, seeking solace among the whispering willows and ancient oaks.  

But today, a prickle of unease danced across Bart's skin. A chill wind whipped through the cemetery, rustling the leaves in an unsettling way. The air felt thick with a presence he couldn't quite place. And for the first time in his memory, the usual symphony of birdsong was absent, replaced by an eerie silence that pressed against him like a heavy shroud.
