The sun, a fiery fist punching through the morning mist, woke Elias Thistlewood with its warmth on his weathered face. He stretched, the joints in his knees popping like dried corn husks, and gazed out over his fields. They lay bathed in a golden light, dew clinging to the emerald leaves of young barley like scattered jewels. This was his domain, this patch of earth nestled in the valley beside the gurgling River Wren. For Elias Thistlewood, it was more than just land; it was a legacy, passed down through generations of his family, each furrow etched with their love and toil.

But lately, a shadow had fallen over the once vibrant landscape. The barley was struggling, stunted and pale, whispering tales of drought in the wind.  The river, usually a source of life and laughter, now flowed sluggishly, a skeletal ribbon reflecting the sun's harsh glare. Elias felt it in his bones, this creeping unease.  Something was amiss, something that threatened the very heart of his world.
