The humid July air hung heavy in Amelia Grace Hawthorne's throat as she adjusted her silk scarf for the tenth time that morning. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, leaving a damp streak on her carefully applied foundation.  She surveyed the gleaming showroom floor of "Luxury Living," its polished marble reflecting the harsh fluorescent lights overhead. Rows upon rows of impeccably designed furniture beckoned, each piece a testament to extravagance and wealth - the very things Amelia sought to sell.  

But today, the usual thrill of the chase felt absent.  A gnawing emptiness sat in her stomach, fueled by missed sales quotas and the ever-present pressure from Mr. Davenport, her relentless boss. Heâ€™d been breathing down her neck all week, reminding her that her position was tenuous at best. 

Amelia sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  The day was young, she reminded herself. Perhaps the perfect client would waltz in soon, ready to spend their fortune on an exquisitely crafted sofa or a hand-woven rug. Or perhaps... perhaps this would be the day Amelia finally realized that "Luxury Living" wasn't living up to its name for her anymore.
