The sun, barely peeking over the horizon, cast long shadows across the dusty main street. Eli watched it all unfold from his perch atop a stack of tires, a wrench clutched loosely in his hand. He wasn't ready for the day to start just yet. His mind was still tangled in a complex problem: a sputtering engine with an elusive fault code that had him stumped.
