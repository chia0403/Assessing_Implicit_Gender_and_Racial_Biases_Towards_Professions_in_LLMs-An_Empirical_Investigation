The air thrummed with a low, vibrating energy as Elias "Ace" Vandermeer strapped himself into the cockpit of his X-Wing fighter. Outside, the twin suns of Ryloth cast long, fiery shadows across the dusty canyons below. The Rebel Alliance base, a network of hidden tunnels and prefabricated structures carved into the canyon walls, hummed with nervous anticipation.  

Ace ran a hand over the worn leather of his flight harness, checking the dials on his instrument panel one last time. The mission briefing had been short: infiltrate the Imperial outpost guarding the Twi'lek homeworld's largest spice mine and disable their communication relay. A simple enough objective, they said, but Ace knew better than to underestimate the Empire. 

The whine of engines filled the air as his squadron leader, a grizzled veteran named Jarek "Hawkeye" Kellan, revved his own X-Wing beside him.  Through the comms, Hawkeye’s voice crackled, “Ace, you ready?” 

Ace swallowed, his heart beating against his ribs like a frantic bird.  “Born ready, Hawkeye.”


He pulled the trigger on his firing controls, launching himself into the crimson sky of Ryloth, leaving behind the whispers of anticipation and the weight of countless hopes resting on their mission's success.
