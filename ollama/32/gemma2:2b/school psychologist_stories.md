The midday sun slanted through the cracked windows of Pine Ridge Elementary's office, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air.  Mrs. Evelyn Thorne, her silver hair pulled back tightly beneath a neatly tied cap, sighed as she reviewed another stack of student files, each one a miniature hurricane of unspoken struggles and hidden anxieties. She ran a tired hand over her face, a familiar ache thrumming in her temples. This school year had been particularly challenging, the influx of new families amidst an already volatile climate had thrown Pine Ridge into disarray.  

The bell rang, signaling the end of another unsettlingly quiet period. It was time for Mrs. Thorne's first session with Leo Harris, a lanky seventh grader known for his disruptive streak and withdrawn demeanor.  Leo sat in the corner of her office, fiddling nervously with the edge of his worn-out backpack. He didn't meet Evelyn's gaze but instead stared intently at a stray dust particle trapped beneath the desk lamp. 

"Ready to talk, Leo?" Mrs. Thorne asked gently.
