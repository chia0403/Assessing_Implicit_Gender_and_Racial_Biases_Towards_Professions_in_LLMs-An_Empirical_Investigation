## Setting: Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary 

**The sanctuary's windswept grounds were alive with chirps and rustling leaves.** Sun dappled through the towering pines that lined its edges, casting dancing shadows on the stone paths winding towards the various enclosures. The air was thick with the earthy scent of soil, damp wood chips, and a hint of wild chamomile –  the plant Maya used to ease the anxieties of her rescued animals.

**Maya Thorne,** her auburn braid bouncing slightly as she walked, gently lifted the lid of the pen housing Willow, a timid fox with fur like burnished copper. Willow's eyes, large and amber, looked up at her, an unspoken plea for reassurance. "Don't worry, little one," Maya whispered, stroking Willow's back, the soft fur radiating warmth in her hands. "I got you." 

**The sun dipped lower, casting a dusky orange glow over the sanctuary. A chill wind whistled through the pines, carrying with it the distant murmur of an approaching storm.** This was no ordinary night; tonight was the full moon. The legend spoke of a power imbued upon this night – a time when even the most resilient animals felt their spirits flicker and falter.  

Maya shivered, pulling her thick sweater closer around her shoulders. It wasn't just the wind that brought chills; it was the weight of responsibility she carried each night. These weren't just pets; these were creatures wounded by the world, their past a tangled web of fear and loss. She had to be strong for them, but even her strongest resolve couldn't truly shield them from the moon’s influence.
