Rain lashed against the windowpanes, mimicking the tempest brewing inside Evelyn Hayes's mind. The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of antiseptic from the waiting room where she sat, her brow furrowed beneath the soft white cap that adorned her hair.  The worn-down rubber band on her wrist, a constant reminder of her 20th anniversary as a physical therapist, felt oddly loose today, echoing the tension in her chest. The file in her hand – Mrs. O'Donnell's case – was like an unwelcome guest at her home; it wouldn’t leave.  Evelyn had always been comfortable with pain, helping patients regain their bodies after injury and illness. But this…this felt different. 

The small town of Oakhaven nestled among rolling hills was a world away from the bustling metropolis she'd left behind. The quaint antique shop across the street held the same allure it did for Evelyn: a gateway to her younger self, back when dreams were bigger than bills and possibilities were endless. Her parents had always instilled in her a love for this town, its small-town charm a stark contrast to the urban sprawl she now navigated in her professional life. Today, though, Oakhaven felt suffocating. Every creaking step on the worn wooden floor of Mrs. O'Donnell’s home, every whisper of wind through the ivy-laden window frames, was a reminder of her past – one filled with ambition and youthful dreams that had been replaced by a weariness she hadn’t anticipated.

 **Evelyn Hayes**, armed with a gentle touch and an unwavering belief in healing, stood on the precipice of a new chapter.
