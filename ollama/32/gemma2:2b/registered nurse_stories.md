Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of St. Cecilia's, mimicking the frantic beating of Emilia Thorne's heart. She was used to tending to patients' wounds - physical and emotional - but tonight felt different. The air thrummed with tension, a palpable weight that settled like dust on her chest.  

Emilia glanced at the clock – 10:32 pm. Another long shift at the oncology ward in the heart of Chicago. It was hardly glamorous, more often than not involving whispered prayers and the endless cycle of hope and despair. But tonight, it felt… personal. A storm raged outside, mirroring the tempestuous emotions brewing within her. The man standing by the window, his back turned towards her, seemed a tangible representation of that internal struggle.

His name was Mr. Hawthorne, though few knew him by anything other than the shadowed figure he’d become.  He had arrived just days ago – frail, emaciated, and shrouded in silence, his only company an ever-present ache in his eyes. He was all but a ghost, consumed by an illness that even the best minds of St. Cecilia's couldn't quite decipher. 

His arrival had shattered Emilia's carefully constructed routine.  Her usual calm demeanor was replaced with an anxious restlessness; she felt as if her world were tilting on its axis. The weight of his mystery pressed down on her, threatening to swallow her whole.
