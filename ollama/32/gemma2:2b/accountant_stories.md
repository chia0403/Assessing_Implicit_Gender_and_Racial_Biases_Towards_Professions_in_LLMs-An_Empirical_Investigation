## Story Opening

The fluorescent lights hummed overhead like a thousand angry bees trapped in a wire cage, mirroring the restless energy that buzzed through Arthur Beaumont's head.  He sat hunched over his desk, the worn leather of his chair digging into his lower back with each meticulous entry on his tax returns. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and yesterday's anxieties, which seemed to follow him like a shadow in this dingy office space. Outside, the city throbbed with a life he could only observe from behind the impenetrable walls of his desk.  It was a Saturday, but Arthur felt as though he were trapped inside a time loop, the same monotonous routine played out week after week for the past decade. 

Arthur Beaumont, certified public accountant and resident recluse, had always known that his life wouldn't be filled with thrilling adventures or breathtaking discoveries. He found solace in order, logic, and spreadsheets, a symphony of numbers in which he played a critical role.  But even the most satisfying melody can become a cacophony when it repeats endlessly without a change of tempo.

**Setting:** Arthur works for "Goldberg & Associates", a mid-sized accounting firm situated on the 10th floor of a building overlooking a bustling, yet somehow sterile, city. The air is thick with the smell of stale coffee and paper, punctuated by the occasional whirr of the air conditioning system and the low hum of phone calls being made.
