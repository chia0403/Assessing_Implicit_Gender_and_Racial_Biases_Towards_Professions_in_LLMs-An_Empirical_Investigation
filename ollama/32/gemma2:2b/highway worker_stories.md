The sun was sinking low, its fiery orange gaze painting the dusty Nevada landscape in hues of rust and gold.  Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt, swirling like miniature tornadoes amidst the endless stretch of highway that stretched before Daniel "Hawkeye" Harrison's tired eyes. Hawkeye shifted his weight, an aching reminder of years spent hauling heavy loads under a harsh desert sun. His calloused hands gripped the wrench tighter, knuckles white against the worn metal.  

He wasn’t meant for this life. Not really. Years ago, he’d dreamt of becoming a writer, crafting stories that would bring comfort to weary souls and stir their imaginations with adventure. But life, as it often does, had other plans. A wife, a child, bills piled higher than the nearby mountains— they'd all called him down a path far less poetic, one marked by asphalt and concrete rather than ink and paper. 

The air hung heavy with heat and anticipation as Hawkeye surveyed the last stretch of the highway before dawn’s first light. Tonight, he was tasked with repairing a critical section - the very same stretch where a freak truck accident had caused a temporary halt to traffic earlier that day.  His gut twisted with a familiar unease; something about this job felt wrong. Something whispered of danger lurking beneath the surface of routine.
