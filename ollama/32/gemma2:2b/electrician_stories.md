The rain hammered against the corrugated metal roof of the shack like a thousand fists on an old man's belly.  A lone figure, silhouetted by the flickering orange light emanating from his battered tools, hunched over a tangled mess of wires in a damp basement. This was the life of Thomas "Mac" Macpherson, a wiry young electrician who seemed to be cursed with an unerring ability to find trouble wherever he went.  The air was thick with the smell of stale beer and something vaguely chemical, like burnt ozone mixed with despair. Mac’s workshop in the forgotten corners of New Orleans felt more like the setting for a crime novel than a place where men made their living fixing lights. 

It was here, amidst the buzzing transformers and flickering neon signs of this ramshackle haven, that he'd stumbled upon her - Amelia Rose, the siren of the French Quarter, with eyes the color of moonlit water and a voice like an echo from the depths of a forgotten cathedral. He hadn’t even known she was missing until he heard it - the desperate plea for help in the dead silence of the night.  Now, Mac was tangled in more than just wires, ready to unravel the mystery that lay buried beneath the dusty floorboards and flickering streetlights of New Orleans.
