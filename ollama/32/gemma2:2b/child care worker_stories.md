The scent of sugar cookies and chamomile tea hung thick in the air as Evelyn "Eve" Thorne carefully arranged the age-appropriate puzzles on the table. Her smile was wide and patient, mirroring the faces peering up at her from amongst a cluster of colorful plastic blocks, their tiny fingers clutching crayons with a fierce determination to create. The small room, bathed in the warm glow of afternoon sunlight streaming through the window, felt like a cocoon of gentle chaos—a sanctuary for seven-year-old dreams and anxieties. 

Eve had loved this job since she was a teenager, watching children blossom under her watchful care. Now, after years of steady devotion to this particular group at "Sunshine Haven," Eve knew their lives better than she knew her own. She'd learned the rhythms of their giggles and tears, the delicate balance between play time and emotional moments. Today felt different, though. There was a palpable energy in the room, an underlying tension that tugged at Eve’s heartstrings. It wasn’t unusual for kids to be jittery before a visit from Mrs. Henderson, the school counselor who came twice a month to offer reassurance after incidents of "the big blues" as she'd called it - those rare moments when sadness threatened to consume even the most resilient little hearts. 


Eve straightened her starched apron and glanced around, taking in the scene: The crayon-covered table groaned under the weight of unfinished masterpieces, a mountain of forgotten blocks, and the scattered remnants of a rainbow of construction paper creations.  She took a deep breath, ready to face the tide of emotions about to crash upon them, yet knowing there was magic hidden within this room's walls.
