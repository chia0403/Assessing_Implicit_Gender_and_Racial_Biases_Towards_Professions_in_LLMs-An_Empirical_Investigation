The smell of crayons sharpened to an almost painful degree filled Amelia “Amy” Thorne’s classroom. It was a Tuesday in early April, meaning that even the sunlight seemed sluggish, reluctant to fully break through the layers of grime and dust that clung to every surface. The children were in their usual chaotic state, running, squealing, and demanding juice boxes and more glitter glue, but Amy found her gaze fixated on one corner of the room: a box overflowing with discarded art projects. 

Amy ran a hand over a canvas of mismatched paint splatters, remembering the day before when she had watched eight-year-old Liam attempt to sculpt a dragon. He'd ended up with something vaguely resembling a grumpy, winged blob that looked like it was struggling to escape its own self-imposed prison of gooey glue and glitter. This box housed a microcosm of all of their artistic aspirations – the soaring highs and crushing lows. There was a beauty in the chaos, she knew.  

The bell rang, and with it, the floodgates opened as her 30 kindergartners erupted into a cacophony of sounds and demands for playdough and sticker sheets. As Amy watched them all blur together in a swirling sea of bright colors, she couldn't help but think about the tiny hands that would soon be molding clay, painting their dreams onto paper, and exploring the world through her own eyes, a world she was determined to shape into something beautiful, even if it meant embracing the messy and unpredictable nature of childhood.
