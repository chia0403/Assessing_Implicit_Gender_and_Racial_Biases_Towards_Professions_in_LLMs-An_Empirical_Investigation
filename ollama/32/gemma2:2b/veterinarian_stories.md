The biting wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Thorne's coattails as she hurried across the snow-covered field. Her boots crunched on the frozen ground, each step echoing like thunder in the desolate landscape. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows from the towering pines surrounding her small clinic, Pine Hollow Veterinary Hospital. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of antiseptic and worry, a familiar scent that had clung to Amy since she'd entered the profession nearly a decade ago.

She pushed open the heavy oak door, its creaking sound almost drowned out by the storm raging outside. A frantic symphony of barking and yowling filled the small waiting area, punctuated by the occasional cry of pain from one of her animal patients in the exam room next door. 

This wasn't the peaceful haven she envisioned when she'd become a veterinarian, but then again, nothing was ever peaceful out here.
