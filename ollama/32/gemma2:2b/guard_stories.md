The iron bars of the watchtower groaned as Elara adjusted the weight on her hip, the familiar clink a counterpoint to the rhythmic thrumming in her chest.  Below, the sprawling market of New Asteria pulsed with life: merchants hawked wares under striped awnings; children chased pigeons; and the air vibrated with the murmur of a thousand conversations. It was the kind of day where even the dust seemed to shimmer – an echo of the boundless, untamed beauty Elara had known in her childhood on the outskirts of the city. Now, at just 24 years old, she was a hardened guard within the protective walls of New Asteria's central fortress.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the stone courtyard, and a chill wind whistled through the worn latticework of the tower. Elara tightened her grip on the sword strapped to her waist, its polished steel catching the last vestiges of sunlight. Today was no ordinary watch. The rumors had been swirling for weeks: the Night King's return, whispered in hushed tones by the city elders and spread like wildfire through the marketplace. 

The Night King – a phantom whose legend grew with each passing day. He was said to be a creature of the twilight, wielding an otherworldly darkness that threatened to consume the very heart of New Asteria. Elara's duty now lay not in fear, but in vigilance.  Tonight, she would stand guard against the encroaching shadow, her heart heavy with responsibility for the city and its people.
