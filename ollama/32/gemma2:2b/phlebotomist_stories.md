The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Croft's head, casting an almost sickly yellow glow on the waiting room patients.  Her crisp white coat felt tight against her arms as she adjusted the leather strap across her body, its weight a familiar comfort amidst the unnerving energy of the place. The day was already buzzing with a low-grade anxiety that would only escalate when she stepped into the main clinic. Today's schedule was filled with the usual suspects: diabetics with stubborn blood sugar issues, young mothers who hadn't gotten around to their annual checkup, and elderly patients trying to navigate their Medicare for the first time.  

Amy felt a familiar pang of empathy as she witnessed another patient's face crumple before her.  The woman's hand trembled in hers as Amy began to prepare the equipment for blood draws. The routine was calming, grounding, providing a sense of purpose that few jobs could match. But even with the mundane task at hand, something about today felt off â€“ like the air itself was charged with an unspoken tension.
