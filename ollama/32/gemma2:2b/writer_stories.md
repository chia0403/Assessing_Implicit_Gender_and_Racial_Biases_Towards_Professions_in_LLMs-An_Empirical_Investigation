## Story Opening: 

The rain hammered against the windowpane, each drop exploding like a miniature starburst in the pale moonlight spilling across the worn wooden desk. Amelia "Amy" Sterling hunched over her typewriter, the keys clacking out a rhythmic counterpoint to the storm's fury. She hadn't slept in two days. Her story, her magnum opus, was proving as elusive as a ghost in the attic of an old Victorian mansion.

**Setting:** A dimly lit, cobwebbed studio apartment above a dusty antique store in Edinburgh. 

**Main Character:** Amy Sterling -  A young writer burdened by inspiration and plagued by doubt. She's struggling to finish her debut novel, "The Ghost of Grey Abbey," set amidst the ancient shadows of Edinburgh's historical district.
