The air hung thick with the smell of salt and sunscreen, a dizzying mix that mirrored Amelia's headache as she surveyed her chaotic office. The "Luxury Escapes" banner above her door was crooked, held together by more desperation than charm.  Amelia 'Emmy' Thorne, queen of travel arrangements (or at least so she thought), stared at the mountain of unsold brochures and unfulfilled bookings, a storm brewing in her usually sunny eyes.  The island of Isla Verde, once a haven for honeymooners and jet-setters, had become a victim of its own abundance: overtourism was swallowing paradise whole.  Her last client, Mrs. Henderson, an elderly woman who'd booked a "romance retreat" at the local spa (which she now described as being "slightly run down"), had just left, muttering about her "youthful vigor" fading away. 

Emmy's phone buzzed, a notification of another cancellation - this time from a couple hoping for a quiet island getaway, their honeymoon ruined by the sudden influx of tourists, each vying for the same space on the pristine beach.  She rubbed her forehead; this was worse than she'd ever imagined when she started planning a career in travel after being kicked out of her family's antique shop. 


**Setting:** Isla Verde, an idyllic island off the coast of Florida known for its vibrant coral reefs and luxury resorts, is now struggling with the overwhelming influx of tourists that threatens to drain it of its charm.
