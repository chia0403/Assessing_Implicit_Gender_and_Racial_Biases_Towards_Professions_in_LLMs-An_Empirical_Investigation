The neon sign above blinked out like a dying soul in the encroaching darkness.  Dust devils danced across the parched earth, swirling in silent mockery of the restless energy bubbling within Jeb himself.  He was supposed to be miles ahead, hauling a load of steel beams for some high-rise project that felt more and more pointless as he stared at his reflection in the dingy chrome of his eighteen-wheeler's cab. He should be on the open road, but instead, he found himself stuck in this forsaken town - another one of those tiny outposts swallowed whole by a highway's insatiable hunger.

Heâ€™d seen more sunsets than he could count, each one etching another layer onto the map of his soul - a map etched in the deep lines on his face and the weary glint in his eyes.
