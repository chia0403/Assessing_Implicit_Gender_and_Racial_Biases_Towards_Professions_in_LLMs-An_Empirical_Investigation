The wind whipped around Evelyn Thorne's face, carrying with it the tang of salt and the faint scent of decay that lingered in the air.  She stood on the crumbling stone terrace of a once-grand lighthouse, now a skeleton against the relentless march of the sea. It was here, amidst these remnants of forgotten dreams, that Evelyn would spend her days lost in the labyrinthine world she created: buildings not made of bricks and mortar but spun from paper, threads, and memories. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the desolate island, bathing Evelyn's workshop â€“ a repurposed shipping container nestled beneath the shade of towering sea-grass - in a warm orange glow. Inside, her canvas was a riot of vibrant colours, a testament to her untamed imagination. Buildings stretched from blueprints to lifelike projections, each one a reflection of her own chaotic spirit, as raw and unyielding as the ocean that surrounded them.
