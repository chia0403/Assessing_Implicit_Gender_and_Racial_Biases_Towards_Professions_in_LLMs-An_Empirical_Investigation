**Atmosphere:**  A peculiar blend of tranquility and frenetic energy hangs in the air. The summer heat brings a constant buzzing hum of activity – beachgoers flocking to the sandy shores, tourists snapping selfies by historic lighthouses, and locals tending to their gardens bursting with vibrant blooms. Yet, beneath the seemingly idyllic facade lies a dark undercurrent: Havenwood harbors a secret - one that whispers on the salty breeze and chills in the shadows at night.

**Time:** A sweltering June afternoon. 


## Character Introduction:

**Name:** Dr.  Amelia "Amy" Hayes 
**Age:** 32
**Profession:**  A brilliant, yet introverted, dentist with a gentle touch, Amy finds solace amidst the whirring of her drill and the faint, sweet smell of antiseptic. The familiar routine of her work provides a necessary anchor in a life that often feels adrift.


## Story Opening:

The salt-laced air whipped strands of Amy's hair across her face as she leaned out the office window, gazing down at the town’s bustling waterfront. Havenwood was in its full summer glory, with its cobblestone streets shimmering beneath the relentless sun, and tourists thronging to the small pier for a glimpse of the legendary "Sea Witch" – the local legend that had haunted the shores since time immemorial.  Amy smiled wryly, shaking her head at the superstitious tales plaguing the town. For years she’d tried to ignore them, even scoff at their existence when her colleagues dared to mention the whispers about a dark undercurrent beneath Havenwood’s idyllic facade. 

She was Amelia Hayes, not Sea Witch's Daughter.  A name that was both reassuring and maddeningly impossible. Her mother had died in childbirth; her father, a renowned but reclusive historian, never revealed much of the truth behind their family lineage. All Amy knew was that his research on Havenwood's ancient history had unearthed some unsettling whispers about hidden truths lurking beneath the surface of their town’s peaceful facade.  

As she continued to watch the tourists flocking to the pier, a single name surfaced in her mind, a name whispered by her late father: "Sebastian." 

Amy knew she couldn't ignore this call; it felt like a persistent storm cloud gathering on the horizon of her meticulously ordered life. The more questions she asked herself, the louder the storm grew within her. And tonight, Amy Hayes had no choice but to face it all - even if it meant stepping into the unknown depths of Havenwood's darkest secrets.
