Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof, each drop a tiny drumbeat on the old warehouse's skeletal bones.  Inside, amidst the tangle of scaffolding and dusty machinery, John "Ironhand" Callahan hunched over his coffee mug, its warmth barely reaching through the cold chill that seemed to seep into his very marrow. It was a familiar misery; the kind he'd become accustomed to after years spent in the unforgiving grip of the city's construction boom.  The warehouse, nestled on the edge of the forgotten industrial district, held memories as deep and thick as the oil stains coating its concrete floors. It was here, surrounded by ghosts of past projects, that John felt most at home. 

He hadn't wanted this job. He'd been a painter, his hands crafting beauty on canvases before reality chipped away at his dreams like sand through a time-worn hourglass. But when the city whispered its promise of quick riches, he'd answered the siren song.  Now, with each passing storm, John felt that same despair gnawing at him - an echo of a dream that had slipped past his grasp and vanished into the swirling dust of forgotten possibilities.
