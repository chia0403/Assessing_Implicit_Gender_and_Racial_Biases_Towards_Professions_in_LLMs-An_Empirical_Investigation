The rhythmic hum of clippers against hair was Amelia's lullaby.  She loved the smell of hairspray, the sheen of freshly-cut curls, the satisfying click of shears on canvas – her life as a stylist at "Hair Haven" was a symphony in its own right. The salon itself was an old Victorian mansion perched precariously on a hill overlooking the sprawling coastal town of Seahaven.  Its faded grandeur and creaky floorboards whispered stories of generations past, each one a tapestry woven into the very fabric of the building. 

Amelia ran a calloused thumb over her own carefully-maintained blonde bob, tracing the pattern where her grandmother's silver hair had once danced in the wind when she was young.  Today, however, was different. The familiar comfort of the place felt suffocating.  Something was out of kilter. 

Her usually bright eyes were clouded with a dull ache as she glanced at the vacant chair across from her – a mirror reflecting back a stranger's face: a woman whose skin was pale as moon dust and whose deep-set blue eyes, normally sparkling with life, held an icy terror.  The air crackled with a tension she couldn’t quite grasp. 


**Setting:** Seahaven, a coastal town known for its quaint charm and quiet lifestyle, is nestled amidst towering cliffs and serene beaches. The town has a slightly faded grandeur due to being untouched by modern development for decades. 

**Main character:** Amelia Hawthorne
