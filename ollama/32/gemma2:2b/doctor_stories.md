The neon glow of "Midnight Treats" cast long, wavering shadows across Dr. Amelia Blackwood's worn leather shoes as she hurried down the deserted alleyway. A low hum vibrated from inside the bakery, a discordant counterpoint to the symphony of city sounds that normally filled her ears.  She adjusted her coat collar against the unexpected chill of the night air and tugged the hood further over her head. Tonight, though, the usual comfort of her hospital uniform felt alien in the unfamiliar warmth of the alleyway's brick walls. 

**Setting:** A bustling, multicultural city with a vibrant arts scene, yet shadowed corners hold secrets and whispers of danger.  The year is 1980; neon lights flicker against fading black-and-white movies playing on television screens, and disco music starts to fill the air. The aroma of fresh bread hangs in the air, but an underlying tension, almost tangible, threatens to crack it open like a stale baguette.

**Main character:** Dr. Amelia Blackwood, known for her sharp wit and even sharper scalpel, is now wrestling with something far more complex than a diagnosis - she's unraveling a mystery that stretches beyond the hospital walls.  Her late husband, a famed photographer, had left behind a cryptic note hidden in his old camera case, urging Amelia to follow "the scent of forgotten dreams" and find the truth behind a family secret. 


**Possible next steps:**

* **Mystery unfolds:** What specific events or clues might Amelia encounter that hint at the existence of the "scent of forgotten dreams"?  
* **Family ties:** Who could have been affected by this family secret? Are there hidden connections to her work, to the city's underbelly?
* **Internal conflict:**  Does she trust the notes left behind by her husband or face the possibility that something sinister may be at play? 


Let me know if you want to explore any of these possibilities further!  I can develop the story from here.
