The scent of old soap and wood polish hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elias Thorne like a familiar shroud. It was a smell that held decades of memories – each swipe of the comb, each lather of his famed boar bristle soap, bringing back a parade of faces from his 40 years at "Thorne's Trim."  His shop, tucked away on Oak Street in the heart of old New Salem, was more than just a place to shave; it was a sanctuary. Its worn wooden floors creaked softly underfoot, the metal shears sang their song with each snip of fabric, and the faded green paint on the walls seemed to whisper tales of countless lives lived. 

Elias Thorne was as much a part of New Salem as the oak tree whose gnarled branches scraped the sky outside his shop window. His hands moved with the precision of a surgeon, his eyes studying his clientele like a poet deciphering a sonnet. Yet tonight, Elias found himself staring at the reflection in his mirror – a man older than he felt, his face lined with years etched by both laughter and worry.  A shadow fell across the shop's entrance as a young girl, her eyes wide and filled with trepidation, stepped into his world.
