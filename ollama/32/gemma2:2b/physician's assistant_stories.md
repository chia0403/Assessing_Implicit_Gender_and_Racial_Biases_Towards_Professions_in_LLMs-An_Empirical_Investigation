## Story Opening:

**Setting:**  A bustling clinic in a quiet suburb outside Seattle. The aroma of fresh-brewed coffee mingled with antiseptic smells; a worn record player played mellow jazz from a corner shelf. 


**Main Character:** Amelia “Amy” Jensen, Physician's Assistant to Dr. Eleanor Hayes, a renowned cardiologist, was the only one who could navigate the chaotic flow of patients and emergency calls without losing her cool. Her calm demeanor was something Dr. Hayes relied on, even during the most stressful moments. Amy’s days were punctuated by hurried rounds through exam rooms, a constant hum of electronic medical records, and the occasional phone call with a frantic family member of a patient in crisis.  

**Opening Paragraph:** 


“You ready for another ‘miracle cure,’ Mr. Henderson?” Dr. Hayes asked, her voice a symphony of warmth and gentle sarcasm as she adjusted her glasses. Amy chuckled – it was a familiar refrain, one that often followed every patient meeting. “I don’t know, Doc,” Amy replied with a smirk, knowing full well how improbable any “miracle cure” truly was in the intricate world of human health. Yet, there was an undeniable hope in her eyes as she looked at Mr. Henderson, his face etched with a blend of fear and desperation. This wasn't just another routine check-up; this was a man on the brink, clinging to every thread of his fading life.  It was a testament to their shared purpose - to bring order to chaos, to offer some semblance of hope in the face of illness. 


**Prompt for you:** How does Amy feel about her job? What are the challenges she faces?
