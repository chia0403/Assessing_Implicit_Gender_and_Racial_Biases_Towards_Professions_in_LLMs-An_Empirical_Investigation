## Story Opening

**Setting:** A sun-drenched summer afternoon in rural Vermont.  Homestead winds whispered through the towering pines, their needles catching the fleeting rays of sunlight that danced across the valley floor. 

**Main Character:** Elias Thorne, a man built like a redwood and as weathered as an old barn roof he'd once installed himself. Elias worked as a roofer - a trade passed down from father to son for three generations in his family. His hands, calloused and strong, knew the feel of every shingle, every seam, every ridge cap. 

**Opening Lines:**  Elias tightened the screws on the final shingle, the afternoon heat clinging to him like the weight of years spent under a summer sky. He'd been up on that roof for hours now, sweat stinging his eyes as he surveyed the finished line between sky and wood. The house across the street was almost entirely rebuilt - from the frame to the gutters, Elias had brought this old farmhouse back to life. But even with his hands covered in grease and grime, a sense of pride washed over him that transcended the physicality of the job.  This one felt special. 

"Something's different about this one," he muttered aloud, tracing the worn wood of the gable. "It feelsâ€¦lighter." He couldn't explain it. The house held a story too deep for words. And as the sun dipped below the horizon, casting long shadows across the valley, Elias started to wonder if this wasn't just another job, but the start of something more.
