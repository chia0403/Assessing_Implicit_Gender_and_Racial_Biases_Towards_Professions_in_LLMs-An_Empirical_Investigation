The air hung heavy with the scent of sawdust and pine as Elias Thorne finished hammering the final nail into his latest masterpiece. A weathered oak chest sat proudly on its side, polished smooth by years of careful work.  It wasn't just any chest; this one was destined for Mrs. Eleanor Featherstoneâ€™s attic room in the old manor house at the edge of town. It was a commission Elias had taken on after finding a single tattered photograph hidden inside, depicting a woman with hair like raven's wings and eyes that shone like sunlit river stones. The image had haunted his dreams ever since he found it, driving him to complete this chest, hoping to somehow understand the mystery behind its enigmatic subject.

Elias was known throughout the small town of Oakhaven as a craftsman of unparalleled skill, with hands that moved like water over wood and a heart that hummed with quiet wisdom. His workshop, nestled in the shadow of the old mill, boasted shelves groaning under the weight of finely-grained mahogany, the scent of cedar lingering even in the dusty air.
