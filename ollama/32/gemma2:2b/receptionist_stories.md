Rain lashed against the windows of "The Grand Blackwood," a Victorian monstrosity perched precariously atop a hill overlooking a swirling sea of grey clouds. Inside, Amelia Bellweather nervously straightened her crisp blue uniform as she glanced at the clock. 7:12 pm. The hour marked a grim turning point for every receptionist in this crumbling establishment.

Amelia was known as "The Nightingale," not just for her penchant for whistling during mundane tasks, but also for the uncanny way she could find lost items â€“ a misplaced pair of spectacles, a forgotten engagement ring, even the occasional stray sock belonging to the eccentric Mrs. Featherstone.  Her talent, however, seemed less useful than ever tonight. The air was thick with tension; whispers and hushed voices were carried through the opulent yet forlorn hallways like a mournful wind.

The owner, Mr. Blackwood himself, had gone into town earlier that day for what he called "a personal matter." His absence had been met with a mixture of resignation and trepidation amongst the staff. Amelia glanced at her reflection in the polished surface of a framed portrait of the first black-eyed Blackwood (Mr. Blackwood's ancestor).  The man's smile seemed to mock her as she caught sight of his piercing gaze, a stark contrast to the faint flicker of fear dancing across her own face.
