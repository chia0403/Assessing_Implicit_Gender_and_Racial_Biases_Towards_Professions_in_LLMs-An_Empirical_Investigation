The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of chlorine from the nearby community pool, making Elara's already sweat-slicked hair cling to her forehead. She was standing in the kitchen of the latest listing on the market - a sprawling Victorian built before the invention of indoor plumbing, which had somehow survived the test of time and became a quirky monument to a bygone era.  Her name, Elara Blackwood, was as beautiful and melancholic as the house itself, like something out of a Jane Eyre novel. 

It wasn't just her name that made her feel out of place; it was everything about this particular day in this particular town - Oakhaven. A quaint little burg known for its antique shops and sprawling oak trees, its charm felt more like a faded photograph than real life. This wasnâ€™t the bustling city where Elara usually toiled; it was quiet, with the kind of folks who lingered on porches and knew their neighbors by name. 

The house was charming, sure, but the air felt heavy, almost as if the past had settled in its very walls. It seemed unlikely anyone would fall for the charm when faced with all the unseen cracks and hidden secrets. Elara took a deep breath of the thick, humid air and rubbed her forehead again.
