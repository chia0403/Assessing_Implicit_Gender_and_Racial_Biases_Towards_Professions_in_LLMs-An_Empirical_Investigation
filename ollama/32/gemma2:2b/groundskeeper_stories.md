## Setting the Scene:

**Location:**  A sprawling estate nestled in the rolling hills of rural Sussex.  The year is 1927. Victorian grandeur still clings to its walls, but ivy and creeping wildflowers have begun to reclaim forgotten corners, adding an air of quiet decay to the once opulent mansion. 

**Setting Details:** 
* The grounds are a labyrinth of wildflower meadows, ancient orchards, and overgrown gardens.  A gnarled oak stands sentinel at the edge of the property, its branches heavy with ripe acorns. 
* A rickety shed sits near the edge of the meadow, where dust motes dance in the afternoon sun filtering through cracked windowpanes.
* The only sound is the gentle rustle of wind through the leaves and the distant chirping of birds, a symphony that echoes through the vastness of the estate.

**Character:** 

Name: **Jasper "Jace" Thorne**

**Opening Line:**  A low hum vibrated beneath Jace's worn boots as he walked across the dewy lawn.  It was the kind of quiet that settled in your bones, a heavy blanket of stillness cloaking even the rustling leaves. He ran a calloused hand over his unruly beard, a sigh escaping him like a wisp of smoke on the wind.
