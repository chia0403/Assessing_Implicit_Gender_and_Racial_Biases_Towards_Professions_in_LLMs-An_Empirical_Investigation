The scent of dust and granite clung to Elias Thorne like a second skin.  He lived and breathed his craft in the heart of the Granite City, its towering skyscrapers piercing the sky like jagged teeth. This city, named for the very substance that formed the bones of its populace, was built on stone - rough, unforgiving, and yet strangely beautiful. Elias worked in the shadow of the Grand Monument, a colossal obelisk carved from an ancient granite slab, a testament to mankind's enduring ambition.  He felt himself dwarfed by the monument, his own small workshop nestled amidst the bustling symphony of industry that surrounded it. 

His fingers, calloused and scarred, danced across the chisel, carving away at another piece of the monument. He was known as Elias the Stone Carver, and he poured his life's passion into each piece, coaxing out a silent song from the granite's heart. But tonight, something felt different. The air thrummed with an unspoken tension; a palpable shift in the city's usual hum.
