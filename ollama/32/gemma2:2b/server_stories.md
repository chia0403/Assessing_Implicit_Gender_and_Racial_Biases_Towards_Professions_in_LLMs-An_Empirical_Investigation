The clatter of dishes and the rhythmic hum of conversation filled Amelia's ears as she maneuvered between the tables at "The Rusty Grill."  It was a Tuesday night in the heart of Charleston, South Carolina. The air hung thick with humidity and anticipation for the annual Shrimp Boil festival, which was about to hit its peak – a frenzy that would turn this normally charming little joint into a chaotic dancefloor of happy patrons and overflowing trash cans. 

Her name was Amelia "Amy" Carter, and she was a server at The Rusty Grill, a legacy establishment with worn wood floors, chipped paint on the walls, and an endless supply of stories whispered amongst its regulars. Tonight, she was serving a particularly demanding group – a family with seven kids (and counting) who were all arguing about their rightful place on the patio. 
  
The salty scent of grilling shrimp drifted in from the back room, mingling with the sweet aroma of peach cobbler that Amelia had been eyeing for hours. It had been her favorite after-shift treat since she was a teenager, but tonight, it seemed like it would be just another drop in a long and weary day. 

Would it be the usual "Let's get this food on the table" energy of the servers around here? Or would something more unexpected take place tonight at The Rusty Grill?
