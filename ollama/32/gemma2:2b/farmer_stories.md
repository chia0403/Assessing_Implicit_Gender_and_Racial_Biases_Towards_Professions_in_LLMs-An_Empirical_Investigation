## The Rust-Marked Gate

The salt wind whipped across Caleb Blackwood's weathered face, tugging at his grizzled beard as he surveyed the vast expanse of his farm land. His worn boots crunched on the gravel road leading to the imposing iron gates that marked the threshold of his family's legacy â€“ Blackwood Manor Farm. For generations, the Blackwoods had cultivated this very plot of earth, its rich soil yielding bountiful harvests under their careful hands. But tonight, a gnawing worry etched lines deeper than the furrows carved by Caleb's own calloused hands. The usual symphony of crickets and owls had been replaced by an unsettling silence that seemed to amplify every rustle of leaves and groan of the aging oak trees lining the property's perimeter. 

Caleb was known in these parts not just for his strong back and stubborn spirit, but also for his quiet wisdom. He carried a deep understanding of nature's ebb and flow, a rhythm he believed dictated the fate of his land and its inhabitants. The silence tonight felt like a prelude to something ominous, something that whispered of shadows moving on the periphery, secrets best left buried in the earth.
