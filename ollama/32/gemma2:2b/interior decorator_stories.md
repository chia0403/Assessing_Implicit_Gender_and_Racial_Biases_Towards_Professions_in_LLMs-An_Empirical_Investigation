## The Gilded Cage

**Setting:**  A sweltering summer evening in Palm Beach, Florida. The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of salt spray from the ocean just beyond the expansive windows of Cecile Fontaine's penthouse apartment. 


**Character:** Cecile Fontaine - a woman whose life was an elaborate tapestry woven from silk scarves, designer furniture, and the meticulous art of interior design.  Her name, a French testament to elegance, reflected her own refined personality. She ran her firm "Fontaine & Co." with fierce determination, transforming ordinary spaces into works of art that would make even the most jaded interior decorator gasp in awe. 

**Opening:** Cecile stood at her window, surveying the city's glittering expanse – a symphony of gold, blue, and turquoise reflected on the ocean. The city hummed around her, yet it felt like she was trapped within the gilded cage of her own meticulously curated world. A wave of dissatisfaction washed over her like the tide, leaving behind a bitter aftertaste.  The latest commission for the Vanderbilts – restoring their opulent 1920s mansion - had left her feeling hollowed out. 

**What could be happening? Why is Cecile unhappy? What's the conflict at the heart of this story?**
