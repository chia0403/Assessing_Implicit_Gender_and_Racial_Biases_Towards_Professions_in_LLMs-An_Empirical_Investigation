The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and anticipation. Rain pattered against the windowpanes of Mrs. O'Malley's tiny office, blurring the already muted streetlights outside. Inside, Esmeralda "Essie" Delacroix, her worn-out floral apron tied tightly around her waist, nervously smoothed a stack of tax forms under a flickering lampshade. 

Each form was like another layer to peel back on this year; revealing stories of hardship and hope, of missed opportunities and unexpected windfalls.  Essie's fingers itched with the desire to reach into the file stacks, to unravel each puzzle piece of the lives she was preparing for her clients. But first, she needed a break. 

A quiet sigh escaped Essie's lips as she glanced at the clock. She had been up since dawn, and the relentless drumbeat of deadlines threatened to drown out even the gentle hum of the radio.  It felt like Groundhog Day â€“ but with tax returns instead of fur-covered creatures peering from their holes. This was it. The yearly pilgrimage to the heart of America's financial chaos; a task she performed with an unmatched dedication, despite the mounting tension and occasional bouts of existential dread that came with it.
