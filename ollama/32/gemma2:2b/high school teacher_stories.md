## Setting:

The air hung heavy in the small coastal town of Havenwood.  Salty wind whipped through weathered wooden buildings as it chased away the remnants of the last summer storm, leaving behind a stillness that felt almost suffocating for 17-year-old Ms. Amelia Thorne. The year was 1985, and Havenwood’s charm, once a haven for surfers and sunbathers, had become shrouded in a quiet melancholy. The once bustling pier stood deserted, its rusted railing creaking with each gust of wind. Even the usual symphony of waves crashing against the shore seemed muted.

## Story Opening: 

Ms. Thorne straightened her cardigan sweater, its pale blue fabric contrasting sharply with the grey sea fog rolling into the classroom. It was supposed to be a Friday afternoon – a time reserved for lively chats about upcoming field trips and weekend plans – but a strange silence clung to everything. The usual hum of anticipation from students seemed muted, even absent. Her gaze flitted across the empty desks, each one radiating an unspoken sense of unease. 

"Ms. Thorne," Ms. Johnson's voice came from behind her, hesitant but firm. "We need you in the office."
