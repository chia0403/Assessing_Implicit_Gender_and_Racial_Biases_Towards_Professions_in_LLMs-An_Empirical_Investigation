The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Harold "Chuck" Callahan's shed like a thousand tiny fists hitting a giant drumhead. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of ozone and copper wiring, all punctuated by the hum of the old, vintage radios tucked in every corner. It was 3:00 am, the hour Chuck always swore his magic happened. The dial on his latest project clicked rhythmically as he adjusted a capacitor, its hum vibrating through his worn leather gloves.  He'd been at it for hours, trying to tame the wild signals of the Aurora Borealis – or rather, his attempt to build a radio receiver that could pick up those elusive auroral broadcasts.

The small town of North River was a place where time moved like the slow crawl of an aurora’s lights and memories drifted on the wind. Chuck wasn't just a radio technician; he was the keeper of secrets, the one who listened to the whispers of long-gone voices through crackling transmissions and distant echoes. He'd built his life here, in this shack by the river, surrounded by the ghosts of forgotten radios, each hum a story waiting to be told.
