The greasy spoon's fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Amelia Finch, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cracked Formica tabletop she was wiping down. The air hung thick with the scent of frying bacon and stale coffee, a symphony Eloise had come to know by heart in her two years at Millie's Diner. Outside, the dawn was just breaking, painting the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange. It was too early for tourists, but the regulars were already filtering in: construction workers with calloused hands and weary eyes, truck drivers needing a caffeine jolt before hitting the road, and Mrs. Henderson from down the street who always ordered her scrambled eggs "light as a feather." Eloise sighed, tucking a stray auburn curl behind her ear. Another day, another dozen cups of coffee, another slice of her dreams deferred.
