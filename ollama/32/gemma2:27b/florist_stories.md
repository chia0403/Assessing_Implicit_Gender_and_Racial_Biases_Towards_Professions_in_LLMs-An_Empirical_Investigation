The scent of lilies mingled with the sharp tang of carnations hung heavy in the air, a fragrant fog that clung to Amelia Rosalind Bloom's worn velvet apron. Her shop, "Bloomsbury Blooms," sat nestled between a boisterous bakery and a dusty antique store on Mulberry Lane, its window overflowing with vibrantly colored hydrangeas and cascading ferns. The morning sun, slanting through the dusty panes of glass, painted stripes across the floorboards, illuminating motes of pollen dancing in the air. Amelia sighed contentedly, her fingers brushing against the velvety petals of a crimson rose. Today was market day, and she was eager to see what fresh bounty the farmers had brought.  

But as she reached for a bucket of water lilies, the shop bell chimed, startling her. A figure stood silhouetted in the doorway, shrouded in shadow. Amelia straightened, smoothing down her apron and offering her warmest smile. "Good morning! Welcome to Bloomsbury Blooms. How can I help you?"
