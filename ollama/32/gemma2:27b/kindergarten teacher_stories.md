The aroma of crayons and glue hung thick in the air, punctuated by the occasional shriek of laughter or frustrated sob.  Evelyn Rose Cartwright, her auburn braids pulled tight against the frizz that humidity always brought out, surveyed her kingdom of chaos with a tired smile. Twenty miniature humans were sprawled across the brightly colored rug, absorbed in their individual artistic endeavors. Some were meticulously coloring within the lines, others were using their crayons as weapons, and a few brave souls had abandoned the paper altogether, opting instead to paint elaborate designs on their own faces and arms.  

Evelyn loved her job, truly she did. But today, the relentless summer heat seemed to be amplifying the usual kindergarten cacophony. Beads of sweat gathered on her forehead, threatening to streak down her face like misplaced watercolor paint. A fly buzzed insistently against the windowpane, adding its own irritating drone to the symphony of childish noise.  It was going to be a long afternoon.

The bell for snack time finally rang, bringing a momentary lull to the chaos as twenty tiny hands scrambled towards their cubbies. Evelyn took a deep breath, relishing the few precious seconds of quiet before the inevitable juice spills and cracker crumb explosions commenced.
