The wind, a relentless hand across the plains, whipped Eleanor Mae Callahan's grey braids against her weathered face as she surveyed her domain.  Sunrise painted the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange, casting long shadows from the gnarled cottonwood trees that lined Crooked Creek.  Beyond them stretched endless acres of golden prairie grass, dotted with the dark silhouettes of grazing cattle. Eleanor Mae's heart swelled with a familiar blend of pride and weariness. This land, passed down through generations of Callahan ranchers, was both her burden and her sanctuary.

Today, however, the peace she usually found in the vast expanse before her was shattered by an unsettling stillness.  The cattle, normally restless at dawn, stood eerily still, their heads raised as if sensing a disturbance on the wind. Eleanor Mae frowned, a deep crease etching its way across her forehead. Something wasn't right.
