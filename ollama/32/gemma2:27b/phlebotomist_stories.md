The flickering fluorescent light above cast Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's reflection in a sickly yellow hue as she surveyed the waiting room.  It was barely 8:00 AM on a Tuesday, but already the vinyl chairs were starting to fill with nervous energy. A young mother bounced her fussy toddler on her knee, while an elderly gentleman meticulously folded and unfolded his newspaper. Amelia took a deep breath, the scent of antiseptic mingling with something faintly sweet – perhaps anxiety.

She'd been a phlebotomist at St. Jude's Hospital for five years now, drawing blood like a maestro conducting a symphony. Each vein was a different instrument, requiring a delicate touch and an intuitive understanding of its rhythm. But today felt different. A knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach, fueled by the unusual request she’d received last night: draw blood from a patient in room 304 – a man known only as "Mr. Smith." He was shrouded in secrecy, his identity and reason for being at St. Jude's a closely guarded mystery.

Amelia smoothed down her navy blue scrubs, steeling herself. Whatever lay behind the closed door of room 304, she was ready to face it, needle poised.
