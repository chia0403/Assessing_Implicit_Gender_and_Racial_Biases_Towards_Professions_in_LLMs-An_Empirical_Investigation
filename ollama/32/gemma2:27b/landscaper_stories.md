The air hung thick with the smell of pine needles and freshly cut grass as Elias Thorne surveyed his latest project. Sunlight filtered through the towering redwoods that fringed the sprawling Sonoma County estate, dappling the manicured lawn in a mosaic of light and shadow. Elias ran a calloused hand over the smooth bark of a young Japanese maple he'd just planted, its vibrant crimson leaves a stark contrast against the emerald green backdrop.

This was Elias's domain – transforming barren spaces into verdant havens. He understood the language of plants, the rhythm of nature, the subtle dance between sun and shade.  He could coax life from the driest soil and sculpt unruly vines into graceful arches. Today, however, a disquietude gnawed at him, something beyond the usual ache in his knees after a long day's work.

The house itself was imposing – a Victorian mansion with gingerbread trim and turrets that seemed to pierce the sky. But it was eerily silent. No laughter spilled from open windows, no music drifted on the breeze. It felt like a sleeping giant, its secrets locked away behind heavy oak doors. And Elias couldn't shake the feeling that he wasn't just tending to the grounds – he was stepping into something far more mysterious.
