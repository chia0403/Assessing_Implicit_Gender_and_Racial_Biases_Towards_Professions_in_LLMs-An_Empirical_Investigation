Elias ran a hand through his greying hair, pushing aside the fatigue that threatened to pull him under.

The weight of responsibility, the fragility of hope hanging in the balance â€“ it pressed down on him with an almost unbearable force.  As the nurse wheeled in the gurney, Elias took a deep breath and squared his shoulders. It was time to go to work.
