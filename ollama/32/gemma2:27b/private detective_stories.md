Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Alistair "Al" Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into an impressionistic smear of red and green. The air hung thick with the scent of stale cigarette smoke and desperation, a perfume unique to Al's line of work. His desk, cluttered with half-empty coffee mugs and case files teetering precariously, reflected the chaos brewing within him. A knock, sharp and insistent, sliced through the rhythmic drumming of the rain.

Al squinted at the clock - 2:17 am.  Who the hell would be knocking on his door at this ungodly hour? He pushed himself away from his desk, the springs groaning in protest, and trudged towards the door. Peering through the peephole, he saw a silhouette shrouded in shadows, their face obscured by the brim of a fedora.

Al knew better than to trust appearances. In his line of work, everyone wore a mask, be it literal or metaphorical. He unlocked the door with a click that echoed like gunfire in the silence. "Can I help you?" he rasped, his voice rough from too much whiskey and too little sleep.
