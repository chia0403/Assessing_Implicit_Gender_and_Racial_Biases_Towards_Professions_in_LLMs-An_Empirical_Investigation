She'd spent the last hour staring at brochures showcasing pristine beaches and snow-capped mountains, each image a tantalizing reminder of the adventures she meticulously planned for others. 

Amelia yearned for an escape from her own mundane routine, a break from the endless stream of honeymooners, retirees seeking cruises, and families craving theme park getaways.
