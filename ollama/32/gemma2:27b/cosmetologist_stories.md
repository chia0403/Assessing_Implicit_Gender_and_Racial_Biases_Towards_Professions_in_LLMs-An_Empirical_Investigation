The air hung thick with the scent of coconut oil and burnt sugar as Eloise Marie Delacroix surveyed her handiwork in the mirror. Her client, Mrs. Peterson, beamed back at her, wrinkles deepening around her kind eyes.

"Eloise, darling, you've worked magic!" Mrs. Peterson exclaimed, her hand fluttering to touch the newly vibrant auburn waves cascading down her shoulders. "I haven't felt this beautiful in years!"

Eloise smiled warmly, a familiar flutter of satisfaction filling her chest. Her small salon, nestled above a bustling bakery on Rue Burgundy in New Orleans, was more than just a place to get your hair done; it was a sanctuary for transformations, both internal and external. 


But today, something felt different. A prickling unease lingered beneath the usual contentment, as if a storm cloud had gathered over Eloise's normally sunny disposition. Perhaps it was the insistent rapping at her salon window, the sound muffled by the thick glass but undeniably urgent. Or maybe it was the cryptic note tucked under Mrs. Peterson's appointment card: "Be careful, Eloise. They're watching."

Eloise hesitated, glancing at the note again before tucking it into her apron pocket. She had always prided herself on her intuition, and today, it whispered a warning she couldn't ignore.
