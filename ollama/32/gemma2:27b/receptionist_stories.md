The flickering neon sign outside buzzed erratically, casting an unsettling green glow across Elara Nightingale's tired face. Rain lashed against the dusty windowpanes of "Nightingale Investigations," blurring the city lights into abstract watercolor splashes. A low rumble of thunder echoed through the deserted street, making Elara jump. She sighed, her fingers drumming a restless rhythm on the ancient mahogany desk that served as her post. 

Elara had been alone in the office for hours, the only sound the ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner and the occasional scrabble from a stray pigeon who'd found its way into the dusty air vent. The late-night phone calls usually started around this time, but tonight, the silence felt heavier than usual.
