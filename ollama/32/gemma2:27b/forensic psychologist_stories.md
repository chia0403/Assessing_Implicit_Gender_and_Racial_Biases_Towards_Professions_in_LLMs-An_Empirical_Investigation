Rain lashed against the windowpanes, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the grimy glass. The air hung heavy with the scent of damp wool and stale coffee. Dr. Eleanor Vance stared out at the swirling grey chaos beyond her office window, her reflection superimposed onto the blurred cityscape.  

Eleanor was no stranger to bleakness; it seemed to permeate every facet of her work. As a forensic psychologist for the NYPD, she delved into the darkest recesses of the human mind, piecing together fractured psyches and deciphering the motives behind unspeakable acts. Today's case, however, promised to be particularly unsettling. A string of seemingly random murders had plagued the city for weeks, each victim chosen with chilling precision. The only common thread was a single playing card left on each corpse - the Queen of Hearts.

The phone on her desk buzzed, shattering the silence. It was Detective Michael O'Connell, his gruff voice laced with urgency. "Dr. Vance," he said, "we need you down at the scene. Another one."
