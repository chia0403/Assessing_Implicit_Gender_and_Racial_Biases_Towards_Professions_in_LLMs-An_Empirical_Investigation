The air hung thick and heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and decay. A symphony of cicadas droned in the ancient oak trees that lined the pathway leading to Blackwood Manor.  Elias Thorne, his weathered face creased with years of sun and toil, paused by the rusted gates, a sigh escaping his lips like steam from a kettle.  

The once-grand manor loomed before him, its ivy-choked walls whispering tales of forgotten grandeur. Paint peeled from window frames, revealing glimpses of faded floral wallpaper within. The rose gardens that had once been Elias' pride and joy were now overgrown with weeds, their thorny stems reaching out like grasping claws. Even the fountain, its marble basin cracked and dry, seemed to weep for a bygone era.

Elias straightened his back, pulling his gardening gloves tight. He knew Blackwood Manor was beyond saving, but he refused to let it succumb entirely to neglect. It was more than just his job; it was a duty, an obligation to the memories that echoed within its crumbling walls.
