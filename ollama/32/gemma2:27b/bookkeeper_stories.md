Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Bartholomew Quill's office, blurring the already indistinct view of the cobblestone alleyway below. The incessant drumming was matched by the frantic tapping of Bartholomew's quill against his ledger, each stroke another desperate attempt to balance the books of the notorious Iron Serpent Tavern.

Bartholomew Quill, a man whose name seemed as dusty and antiquated as his ledgers, squinted through his thick spectacles at the tangled mess of figures before him. He wasn't built for brawls or back-alley dealings, which were the Iron Serpent's stock-in-trade. His domain was order, precision, the soothing rhythm of debits and credits. Yet, here he sat, wrestling with a ledger that smelled suspiciously of spilled ale and desperation.

The tavern owner, a hulking brute named Slag, had a reputation for "persuading" his debtors to pay up, and Bartholomew feared becoming another casualty of Slag's brutal methods if he couldn't make the numbers work.
