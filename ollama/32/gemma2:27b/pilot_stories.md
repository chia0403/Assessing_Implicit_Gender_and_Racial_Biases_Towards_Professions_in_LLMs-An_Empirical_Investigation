The rusty scent of aviation fuel hung heavy in the air, mixing with the sweet tang of brine from the nearby harbor. Amelia "Ace" Cortez squinted at the rising sun, its orange glow painting the sky a bruised purple. Her Cessna 172, affectionately nicknamed "Sparky," sat patiently on the tarmac, its single propeller glinting in the dawn light.  Ace ran a calloused hand over the aging plane's fuselage, her gaze lingering on the faded blue paint and the handwritten inscription above the cockpit door: "Aim High, Fly Free."

Today was different. This wasn't just another cargo run to the remote island villages scattered across the turquoise archipelago. Today, Ace was flying into the heart of a mystery. A missing fisherman, an abandoned boat, whispers of a legendary sunken treasure - all clues leading her deeper into the treacherous currents and misty secrets of the Azure Sea.
