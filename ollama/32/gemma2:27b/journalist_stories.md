The stale air of the newsroom hung heavy with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation. Outside, rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Daily Grind, mirroring the storm brewing inside Amelia Kensington's chest.  Five years she'd slaved away at this paper, chasing down mundane stories and dodging her editor's impatient glares, all for a chance to break something big.

Something like the whispers swirling around the abandoned Blackwood Manor on the edge of town. Locals spoke in hushed tones of strange lights flickering within its crumbling walls, of disembodied voices carried on the wind, and of a family curse that had haunted the Blackwoods for generations. Amelia scoffed at first, dismissing it as folklore. But the unsettling glint in the eyes of her interviewees, the goosebumps prickling her arms despite the stifling heat â€“ they were too real to ignore. 

Tonight, she decided, she would finally face the whispers head-on.  She grabbed her battered trench coat and notebook, a surge of nervous excitement coursing through her veins.  Blackwood Manor awaited.
