Rain lashed against the mullioned windows of Blackwood Manor, each gust rattling the ancient panes like skeletal fingers. Inside, Elspeth Thistlewick, her grey bun as tight as a drum, navigated the cavernous hall with practiced ease. The scent of beeswax and dust mingled in the air, a familiar perfume that clung to Elspeth's starched apron like a second skin. For thirty years, she had tended to this grand but decaying house, its secrets whispering from the faded tapestries and echoing in the drafty corridors.

Tonight, however, something felt different. A prickling unease settled on her shoulders as heavy as the rain-soaked shawl draped over the grandfather clock. The silence, usually punctuated by the ticking of the antique timepiece and the crackling fire in the drawing room, was unnervingly profound. Even Mr. Blackwood's gruff voice, typically booming through the halls like thunder, was conspicuously absent. Elspeth paused at the foot of the grand staircase, her gaze drawn to a single flickering candle casting elongated shadows across the dusty portraits lining the wall.


This night, she felt, would be unlike any other.
