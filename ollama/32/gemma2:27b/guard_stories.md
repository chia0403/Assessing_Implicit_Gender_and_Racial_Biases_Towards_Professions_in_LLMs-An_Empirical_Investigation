The biting wind whipped across the desolate expanse of the Obsidian Fields, clawing at Elara Vance's threadbare cloak and stinging her exposed cheeks.  A gritty layer of volcanic ash coated everything, turning the once vibrant land into a monochrome wasteland punctuated by jagged black rock formations. Above, a sky perpetually stained the color of bruised plums hung heavy with storm clouds, promising more icy torment. Elara shivered, tucking her chin deeper into her collar as she trudged along the crumbling stone wall that marked the perimeter of the Sanctuary.  

She was one of five guards tasked with protecting the last vestiges of civilization – a cluster of dome-shaped dwellings huddled together against the elements, their shimmering energy shields flickering like fireflies in the gathering gloom. It wasn't a glamorous job. The threat of raiders from the Ash Wastes was constant, and boredom stretched endlessly between skirmishes.  

Today, however, something felt different. A low thrumming vibration resonated through Elara's boots, a discordant hum that clashed with the wind’s mournful howl. She stopped, scanning the horizon. In the distance, a plume of black smoke rose from beyond the jagged peaks of the Shattered Spine mountains, an ominous sign she couldn't ignore.
