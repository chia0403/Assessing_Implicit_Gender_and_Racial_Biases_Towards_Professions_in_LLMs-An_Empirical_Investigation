The incessant wail of the ambulance siren pierced through ElizaBeth "Beth" Avery's thoughts like a rusty nail through wood.  Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the neon lights of downtown Chicago into impressionistic smears of color. Beth gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white as bone. This call felt different. The dispatcher’s voice had been strained, his words clipped and hurried: "Possible multiple casualties…industrial accident…chemical spill…"

Beth's gut churned with a familiar cocktail of adrenaline and dread. She'd seen it all in her five years on the Chicago Fire Department EMS team – car crashes, drug overdoses, even the occasional bizarre kitchen mishap – but industrial accidents always held an element of unpredictable chaos. 

As the ambulance skidded to a halt in front of a hulking factory building, its windows glowing an eerie orange against the stormy sky, Beth felt a shiver crawl down her spine.  This wasn't just another routine call; this was something big, something dangerous.  Something that could test every ounce of her training and resolve.

The doors swung open with a pneumatic hiss, unleashing the cold, damp air and the pungent smell of burnt metal. Beth snatched her medical bag and braced herself for whatever awaited inside.
