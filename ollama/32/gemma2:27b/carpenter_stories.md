The salt-laced wind whipped Elias Blackwood's greying hair across his forehead as he surveyed the skeletal frame of the new lighthouse keeper's cottage. The timber groaned beneath him, protesting the relentless onslaught of the North Sea breeze. Craggy cliffs plunged dramatically into the churning waves below, a constant reminder of the unforgiving nature of this wild coastline. Elias tightened his grip on the worn handle of his hammer, its head dulled with years of use against stubborn oak and defiant pine. This cottage, perched precariously on the edge of the world, was more than just another commission; it represented a lifeline for a community battered by storms and shrouded in mist.  He needed to finish it before the winter gales arrived, turning the exposed cliffside into an icy tomb.
