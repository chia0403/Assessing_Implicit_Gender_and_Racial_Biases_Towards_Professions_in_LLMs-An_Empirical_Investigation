Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Estelle Ramirez's office, mimicking the relentless drumming anxiety in her chest.  She stared at the file before her â€“ thick, overflowing with incident reports, court documents, and faded photographs. The subject: 19-year-old Damien "D" Cruz, recently released from juvenile detention for a string of petty thefts. He was on probation for six months, reporting directly to Estelle.

Estelle's cramped office in the heart of Oakland's bustling yet troubled downtown felt suffocating. The air conditioner sputtered and wheezed, struggling against the humid summer heat.  She ran a hand through her short, dark curls, trying to quell the rising tide of doubt. D Cruz was a wildcard, a young man teetering on the precipice between redemption and recidivism. Estelle's job was to guide him towards the former, but she couldn't shake the feeling that he might just pull her down with him. 

Today was their first meeting.
