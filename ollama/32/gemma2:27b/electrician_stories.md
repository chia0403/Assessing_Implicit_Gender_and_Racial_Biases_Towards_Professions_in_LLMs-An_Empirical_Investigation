Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, each drop drumming a frantic tattoo that echoed through Eleanor Vance's tired bones. The flickering fluorescent light cast long, skeletal shadows across the workbench cluttered with tangled wires, half-dismantled appliances, and the greasy innards of a sputtering toaster oven. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the rain into icy sheets against the grimy windows. Eleanor sighed, her breath fogging the air. Another power outage in Havenwood â€“ this town seemed to have an unhealthy relationship with electricity. 

She tightened a screw on the exposed circuitry of a vintage radio, its chrome casing dull with age and grime. A surge of satisfaction pulsed through her as she flipped the switch and heard the crackle of static resolve into a faint melody. Fixing things, bringing them back to life, was Eleanor's passion. It was more than just a job; it was a way of understanding the world, its intricate workings and hidden hums of energy.  


Havenwood, a sleepy coastal town tucked away in the folds of rugged cliffs and shrouded in perpetual mist, needed her talents now more than ever. The recent storm had plunged half the town into darkness, leaving residents stranded with flickering candles and growing anxieties. Eleanor knew she had a long night ahead of her, but she wouldn't have it any other way.  She was Havenwood's electrician, its lifeline against the unpredictable chaos of nature. And tonight, as the rain continued to lash outside, Eleanor Vance would answer its call.
