Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Elodie Marchand's sewing machine. The cramped space smelled of damp wood, lavender sachet powder, and something faintly metallic â€“ the tang of forgotten dreams. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Montmartre throbbed with the nightlife Paris was famous for, but Elodie barely registered it. Her focus was narrowed to the emerald silk shimmering under her needle, its luxurious weight promising a transformation. This dress, commissioned by the flamboyant actress Madame Dubois, was not just a garment; it was Elodie's chance, her desperate grasp at escaping the suffocating limitations of her life.

The attic room, with its slanted ceiling and dusty beams, was more workshop than home. Bolts of vibrant fabric spilled from overflowing chests, their colours muted by the fading light filtering through the grime-coated windowpane. Sketches lay scattered across a rickety table, each one a testament to Elodie's artistry, her ability to weave dreams onto silk and lace. Yet, despite her undeniable talent, she remained hidden away in this garret, an unseen hand crafting beauty for others to flaunt.
