Rain lashed against the windows of the St. Jude's Rehabilitation Center, blurring the already muted colors of the autumn afternoon. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright adjusted her spectacles, her brow furrowing as she studied the progress notes on Mr. Henderson, a stroke patient struggling to regain control of his left hand. The rhythmic beep of the heart monitor provided a somber counterpoint to the storm raging outside. 

Amelia wasn't fazed by the weather or the melancholic atmosphere. In fact, she found solace in the steady routine of St. Jude's. Helping her patients rediscover their abilities, however small, filled her with a quiet sense of purpose. Today, though, Amelia felt a prickle of unease. Mr. Henderson seemed withdrawn, his usually jovial eyes clouded with a distant worry.  Something was different, and Amelia intended to find out what it was.
