The fluorescent lights buzzed above Elias Thorne's head like a chorus of agitated wasps. Their pale glare illuminated the swirling dust motes dancing in the stale air of the Grand Blackwood Library, making them resemble miniature galaxies. Elias sighed, his calloused hands tightening around the worn handle of his mop. He wasn't sure what was more oppressive: the silence of the empty library after hours, or the weight of centuries-old knowledge pressing down on him from every towering bookshelf. 

Tonight felt different though. The air crackled with an unseen energy, a subtle hum that set Elias' teeth on edge. As he pushed his cart past the towering oak shelves crammed with leather-bound tomes, a shiver snaked down his spine. He swore he heard a whisper carried on the draft from beneath a cracked windowpane, a voice like dry leaves rustling in a forgotten graveyard. 


Elias stopped, his mop poised mid-air. The library held countless secrets whispered between its aging pages, but this felt different. This felt...alive.
