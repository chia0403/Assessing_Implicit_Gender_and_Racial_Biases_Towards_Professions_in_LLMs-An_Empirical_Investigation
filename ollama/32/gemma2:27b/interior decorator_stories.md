Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Brooklyn brownstone, each drop a frantic drumbeat against Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's already frayed nerves. The air inside was thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. A jumbled mess of fabric swatches, paint chips, and furniture catalogues littered her desk, each representing a design dream gone awry.

Amelia wasn't known for panicking, but this project, a complete renovation of a century-old Victorian mansion in Greenwich Village, was pushing her to the brink. The client, Ms. Vivienne Davenport, a renowned art collector with a penchant for the dramatic and an equally dramatic collection of priceless antiques, had given Amelia free rein, which translated into overwhelming pressure. 

"Amelia Beatrice Cartwright," she muttered to herself, staring at the reflection in the rain-streaked windowpane. "Get it together. You can do this."  She took a deep breath, straightened her floral blouse, and reached for her phone. It was time for a pep talk from her best friend, Sophia, a whirlwind of creative energy and unwavering support who always knew how to calm Amelia's stormiest seas.

But as she pressed the call button, a loud clang from downstairs interrupted her. A shiver ran down her spine. This old brownstone had its quirks – creaking floorboards, whistling radiators, and the occasional inexplicable noise – but this one sounded different. Deeper. Foreboding.
