The stench of disinfectant and anxiety hung heavy in the air of Willow Creek Veterinary Clinic. Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the frantic thudding of Eleanor Hayes' heart. It was 3:02 am, and she hadn't slept in nearly 48 hours.

Eleanor, a woman with eyes as deep and brown as the earth after a storm and hands perpetually stained with antiseptic, stared at the trembling form on the examination table. It was a small terrier mix named Pepper, barely more than a year old, who had been brought in by a frantic young couple hours earlier. Pepper's usually playful demeanor was replaced by whimpers and laboured breaths.

Willow Creek, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains, was known for its tranquil beauty and close-knit community. But tonight, the idyllic setting felt miles away as Eleanor grappled with Pepperâ€™s unknown ailment.  The clock ticked relentlessly, each second a reminder of the precious time slipping away.
