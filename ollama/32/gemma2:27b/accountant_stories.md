Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Theodore "Teddy" Albright's third-floor office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest. Spreadsheets filled his screen, each cell blinking accusingly like a thousand miniature red eyes. His normally tidy desk was buried under piles of receipts and invoices, a testament to the impending audit that felt like a monstrous shadow looming over him.

Teddy rubbed his weary eyes, wishing for nothing more than to escape this suffocating cubicle and disappear into the anonymity of the storm-ravaged streets below. But duty called, as it always did.

And Teddy, despite his quiet demeanor and penchant for meticulously balancing ledgers, found himself entangled in a web of intrigue far more complex than any financial statement he'd ever encountered.
