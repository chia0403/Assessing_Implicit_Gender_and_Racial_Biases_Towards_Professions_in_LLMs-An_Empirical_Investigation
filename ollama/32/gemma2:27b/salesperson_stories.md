The air hung thick with humidity and the smell of frying onions, a peculiar combination that always seemed to permeate the streets of New Orleans' French Quarter. Evangeline "Eva" Dubois smoothed down her emerald green dress, its fabric clinging slightly in the heat.  She adjusted the brim of her straw hat, casting a wary glance at the darkening sky. A sudden downpour wouldn't be good for business. Eva was on her way to meet Mr. LeBlanc, a notoriously difficult antique collector with a penchant for 18th-century French porcelain. She had just acquired a rare set of teacups and saucers, delicate as butterfly wings and painted with scenes of pastoral bliss, and she was determined to make the sale.  

Her heels clicked on the uneven cobblestone street, leading her past wrought iron balconies overflowing with bougainvillea and shops brimming with voodoo dolls, hand-painted masks, and beignet-scented air. Eva's destination, a stately townhouse with faded grandeur, loomed ahead, its windows reflecting the bruised twilight sky.  

A knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach. This wasn't just any sale; it could make or break her. Eva had poured her savings into acquiring these teacups, and she desperately needed this deal to go through.
