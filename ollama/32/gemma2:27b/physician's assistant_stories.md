The stale air in the exam room hung thick with anxiety. Amelia Grace Hawthorne, PA-C, glanced at the clock ticking on the wall â€“ 4:57 PM. Just three minutes until the end of her shift, and she still had Mr. Henderson to see.  He was a new patient, referred for persistent chest pain, and Amelia could already tell by the tremors in his hands that he was deeply worried.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the linoleum floor of the small clinic nestled in the heart of rural Vermont. Outside, the crisp air smelled of pine needles and woodsmoke, but inside the fluorescent lights buzzed relentlessly, casting a sterile glow over everything. Amelia sighed, straightening her neatly pressed scrubs. She wished she could just send Mr. Henderson home with a reassuring pat on the back, but that wouldn't be responsible. Chest pain was never something to brush off lightly, and Amelia prided herself on thoroughness.
