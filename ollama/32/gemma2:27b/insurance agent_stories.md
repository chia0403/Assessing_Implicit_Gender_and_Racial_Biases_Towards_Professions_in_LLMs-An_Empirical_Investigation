Rain hammered against the warped glass of Theodore "Teddy" Finch's office window, blurring the already grimy view of Elm Street. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Teddy, his tie askew and a dark circle under one eye, tapped a chipped pen against a claim form, the rhythmic clicking doing little to soothe his frayed nerves.  

Elmwood Insurance wasn't exactly thriving. Nestled in a forgotten corner of the city, their clientele consisted mostly of down-on-their-luck individuals with more hope than money. Teddy knew every crack in the faded floral wallpaper, every squeak of the rusty floorboards â€“ they were as worn and weary as he felt. Today, however, was different. A new claim had landed on his desk, one that promised to shake up the monotony of his existence and thrust him into a world he could barely comprehend.
