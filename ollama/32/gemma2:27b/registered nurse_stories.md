The incessant beep of the heart monitor cut through Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's sleep like a rusty saw blade. She groaned, shoving her tangled blonde hair out of her face as she fumbled for the snooze button on her phone alarm. 5:30 AM – shift start at St. Jude's General in an hour. Amelia dragged herself out of bed, her bones protesting with every creak and groan. 

St. Jude's was a sprawling brick behemoth nestled amidst the urban sprawl of Cleveland, Ohio. The scent of antiseptic and bleach hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder of the life-and-death battles waged within its walls. Amelia loved her job, truly she did, but sometimes the relentless pressure felt like it would crush her. Today was one of those days.

A gnawing anxiety filled her stomach as she remembered last night's shift – Mr. Henderson, gasping for breath in room 204, his eyes pleading with her to make him better. He hadn't made it through the night. The weight of responsibility, the knowledge that every decision could mean the difference between life and death, pressed down on Amelia like a physical burden.

As she pulled on her scrubs, her reflection in the bathroom mirror stared back at her – weary eyes, hair escaping its messy bun, a faint tremor in her hands. Today was going to be tough. But Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, RN, wouldn't let it break her. She had patients counting on her. And somewhere, deep down, she knew she couldn't do anything else but face the day head-on.
