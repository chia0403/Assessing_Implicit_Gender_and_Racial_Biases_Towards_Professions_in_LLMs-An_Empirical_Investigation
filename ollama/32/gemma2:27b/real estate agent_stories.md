Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "For Sale" sign across the street. Penelope Thistlewick sighed, her reflection momentarily distorted in the rain-streaked glass. She tugged at her collar, feeling the crisp starch of her blouse chafe against her neck. It was a good blouse, one she'd specifically chosen for today's showing – a Victorian fixer-upper with "potential" (Penelope's euphemism for "years of neglected repairs and questionable plumbing").

The address glared back at her from the crumpled listing sheet: 13 Blackmoor Lane. The name alone conjured images of gnarled oaks and cobwebs, whispering secrets in the wind. Penelope wasn't superstitious, but even she felt a prickle of unease as she grabbed her umbrella and headed out into the storm.  

Blackmoor Lane was aptly named. The streetlamps cast long, skeletal shadows onto the deserted sidewalks, and the rain seemed to fall with an unnatural intensity, echoing off the weathered brick facades of the houses. Penelope shivered, pulling her coat tighter around herself. This wasn't exactly the kind of welcoming atmosphere she envisioned for her new clients – a young couple eager to put down roots in this quaint, historic neighborhood.
