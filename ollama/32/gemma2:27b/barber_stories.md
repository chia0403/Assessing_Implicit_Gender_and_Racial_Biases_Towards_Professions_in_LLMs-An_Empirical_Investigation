The scent of bay rum and talcum powder hung thick in the air, clinging to the faded floral wallpaper and worn leather chairs of Enzo's Barbershop. Outside, the midday sun beat down on Mulberry Street, turning the asphalt into shimmering waves of heat. A lone pigeon cooed from a fire escape across the way, its mournful cry echoing Enzo Marconi's own weary sigh. 

Enzo, his salt-and-pepper hair slicked back and his white apron stained with the ghosts of haircuts past, stared out the window. The usual bustle of lunchtime customers was missing today.  His reflection in the dusty mirror – a man etched with worry lines and shadowed by years of early mornings – seemed to mock him. Business had been slow lately, and Enzo couldn't shake the nagging fear that his beloved barbershop, a fixture on Mulberry Street for three generations, might soon be forced to close its doors.
