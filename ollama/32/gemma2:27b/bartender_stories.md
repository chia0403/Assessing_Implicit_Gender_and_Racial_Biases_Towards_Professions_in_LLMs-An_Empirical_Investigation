The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting an unsettling green glow across Elias Thorne's tired face. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Last Call, blurring the streetlights into hazy orbs. Elias sighed, wiping down the already spotless mahogany bar for what felt like the hundredth time that night. The usual Wednesday night lull had settled in, leaving him alone with the ghosts of spilled bourbon and forgotten dreams. 

He was a man carved from shadows and silence, his salt-and-pepper hair perpetually falling into his steel-blue eyes, which seemed to hold an endless well of melancholy. Years tending bar had etched lines around those eyes, each one a story untold. Tonight, though, the stories were muted by the relentless drumming of rain and the unsettling stillness that hung heavy in the air. 


Elias knew something was different tonight. It wasn't just the empty stools or the oppressive atmosphere. It was a feeling, a prickling at the back of his neck, like someone was watching him from the shadows outside.
