The air in the Grand Blackwood Hotel lobby hung thick with the scent of lilies and something else, something metallic and vaguely unsettling. Edgar Bartholomew Quillfeather III straightened his burgundy livery jacket, tugging down the collar to hide the faint tremor in his throat. The grand chandeliers, usually glittering beacons of opulence, cast long, unnerving shadows across the polished marble floor. 

Edgar had worked at the Blackwood for five years, and he'd never seen it so deserted. Usually bustling with socialites and businessmen, tonight the lobby echoed with an unsettling stillness. Only a few guests lingered near the grand fireplace, their faces pale and drawn under the flickering firelight.

A gust of wind rattled the stained-glass windows overlooking Blackwood Avenue, momentarily extinguishing one of the chandeliers. Edgar shuddered, his gaze drawn to the darkened windowpanes. It was as if the hotel itself were holding its breath, waiting for something terrible to unfold.
