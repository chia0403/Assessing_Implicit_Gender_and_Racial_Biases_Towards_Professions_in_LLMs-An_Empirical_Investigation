The acrid smell of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of ozone from the outdated photocopier that wheezed its disapproval every time someone dared to use it. It was 6:47 am, and Elias Bartholomew III was already three espressos deep, his eyes glued to a Bloomberg terminal blinking insistently in the dim light of the pre-dawn trading floor. 

Elias wasn't your typical Wall Street wolf. His tailored suit felt more like armor against the relentless pressure of the market than a symbol of power. The lines around his eyes spoke of sleepless nights spent analyzing charts and deciphering whispered rumors, but beneath the fatigue flickered a glint of determination â€“ a fire that burned brighter than the flickering neon signs outside his office window reflecting on the glass facade. Today was different. Today, Elias had a hunch, a gut feeling that told him this wasn't just another day in the trenches. This was the day he could change everything.
