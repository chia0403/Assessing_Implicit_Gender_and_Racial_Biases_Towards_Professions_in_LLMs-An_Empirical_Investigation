The scent of old parchment and pipe tobacco hung heavy in Professor Elias Blackwood's cluttered office.  Sunlight slanted through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing over stacks of leather-bound volumes that threatened to engulf his mahogany desk. Elias himself, a man with silver hair perpetually escaping its tidy comb-over and piercing blue eyes magnified by thick spectacles, hunched over a faded map spread across the worn surface. His fingers traced the jagged lines depicting the Serpent's Spine mountains, a notoriously treacherous range rumored to hold forgotten secrets. A shiver ran down his spine, not entirely from the chill emanating from the ancient stone walls of his office in Oxford University.

This wasn't just another academic pursuit for Elias; it was an obsession that had consumed him for years. The map, unearthed from a crumbling monastery library in the Swiss Alps, hinted at a hidden temple nestled deep within the Serpent's Spine, a place whispered to hold knowledge lost since the dawn of civilization.
