The midday sun beat down on Rusty Wrench Repair, turning the corrugated iron roof into a frying pan.  Inside, sweat beaded on Elias "Eli" Beaumont's forehead as he wrestled with the seized engine of a '67 Mustang. The smell of burnt oil and gasoline hung thick in the air, punctuated by the occasional clang of Eli's wrench against stubborn metal. Outside, cicadas shrieked their relentless summer song.

Eli wasn't one for complaining. He loved the grit and grime of his work, the satisfaction of coaxing a wheezing engine back to life. But today, even he felt the heat bearing down on him.  He paused, wiping his brow with a grease-stained rag, and stared at the Mustang, its faded blue paint peeling like sunburned skin. This beauty deserved better than to be languishing in his dusty garage, forgotten by time and neglect. 

Just then, the bell above the door jingled, signaling a customer. Eli straightened up, hoping it wouldn't be Mrs. Henderson again with her whining minivan and endless list of imaginary problems.
