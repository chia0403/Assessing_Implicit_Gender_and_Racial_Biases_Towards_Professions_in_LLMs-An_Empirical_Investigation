Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Albright's chiropractic office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The quaint, Victorian-era building nestled on Maple Street in Harmony Creek was usually abuzz with the comforting clicks and pops of spinal adjustments, interspersed with lighthearted banter. Today, however, an oppressive silence hung heavy in the air.

Evelyn stared out at the swirling grey sky, the weight of her father's recent diagnosis pressing down on her chest. His failing health had brought her back to Harmony Creek after a decade building a successful practice in bustling Seattle. Leaving behind her thriving clientele and the promise of partnership felt like a betrayal, but Evelyn couldn't bear the thought of her father facing his illness alone.

The chime above the door tinkled, momentarily breaking the spell. A young woman with bright red hair and anxious eyes stepped inside, clutching a worn-out backpack. This was no ordinary patient. This was Amelia Evans, the daughter of Harmony Creek's reclusive, rumored-to-be-a-witch baker, Agnes Evans. Evelyn knew Amelia needed more than just a spinal adjustment. She needed hope, and perhaps, a little magic of her own.
