The scent of chlorine and sweat hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the rhythmic thump of electronic dance music.  Beaming from behind the instructor's podium, Amelia "Amy" Rodriguez surveyed her class with a mix of pride and amusement. Their faces were flushed, brows furrowed in concentration as they mirrored her every move during the high-intensity interval training session.

The AquaFit Studio was a converted warehouse space in Miami's vibrant Wynwood district, its exposed brick walls adorned with colorful murals depicting scenes from local life.  Giant windows flooded the room with sunlight, showcasing the turquoise waters of Biscayne Bay shimmering beyond. 


Amy, her toned physique clad in a neon green sports bra and matching leggings, moved with the grace and energy of a seasoned dancer. Her infectious enthusiasm was impossible to resist, even for those struggling to keep up with the demanding routine.  

But today felt different. A tension thrummed beneath the surface, a sense of unease that had nothing to do with burpees or squats. It started with a cryptic message she received earlier that morning - just three words: "He's watching you."
