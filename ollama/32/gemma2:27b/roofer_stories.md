The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his collar damp with sweat. He perched precariously on the ridgeline of a Victorian mansion in Oakhaven, its ornate shingles casting intricate shadows across the overgrown lawn below. Eli gripped the slate tiles tightly, feeling the grit dig into his calloused palms. The wind, a mischievous child tugging at his safety harness, threatened to rip him from his perch. He squinted at the horizon, where a wall of charcoal clouds promised an afternoon deluge. 

Eli wasn't afraid of heights. He was afraid of time, of deadlines looming like vultures circling overhead. This roof needed to be finished by sundown; Mrs. Hathaway wouldn't tolerate another delay. But with every gust of wind, with every creak of the aging timbers beneath his boots, doubt gnawed at him. Would he make it?
