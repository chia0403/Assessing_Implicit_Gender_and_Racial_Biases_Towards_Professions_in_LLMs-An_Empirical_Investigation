The air hung thick with humidity and the scent of lilac hairspray, a familiar perfume to Elara Cartwright.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes of "Elara's Enchantment," illuminating swirling motes of dust and casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Outside, cicadas buzzed relentlessly in the Georgia heat, their chorus punctuated by the occasional honk of a passing car on Main Street.

Elara leaned against her vintage styling chair, its chipped chrome reflecting her image â€“ a woman with fiery red curls piled atop her head and eyes the color of melted chocolate. She sighed, picking at a loose thread on the faded floral upholstery. Business had been slow lately, leaving her with too much time to dwell on the weight of her overdue bills and the persistent ache in her knee from years of standing.

Suddenly, the tinkling bell above the door announced a customer. Elara straightened, smoothing down her apron and plastering on her best smile. A young woman, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, hesitantly stepped inside.
