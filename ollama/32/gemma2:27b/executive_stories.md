Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Alistair Blackwood's corner office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside him. Forty-seven floors above the bustling streets of Manhattan, the CEO of Zenith Innovations stared at the plummeting stock prices on his monitor, a knot tightening in his gut. The launch of their flagship AI product, "Prometheus," had been disastrous. Glitches, unforeseen errors, and scathing reviews from tech giants - it was a PR nightmare.

The sleek, minimalist office, usually a sanctuary of calm efficiency, felt oppressive tonight. Alistair, a man accustomed to controlling every variable, found himself grappling with the unpredictable hand fate had dealt him. He ran a hand through his silvering hair, the weight of thousands of employees and investors pressing down on him. The future of Zenith Innovations hung precariously in the balance, and he was running out of time.
