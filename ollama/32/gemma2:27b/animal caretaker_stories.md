Rain lashed against the windows of The Whispering Willow Animal Sanctuary, a quaint farmhouse nestled on the edge of the whispering woods. Inside, Esmeralda "Esme" Hawthorne, a woman whose smile lines rivaled the wrinkles on her worn leather boots, hummed softly as she refilled feeders for the rescued barn owls. Their amber eyes blinked at her with gratitude, or perhaps just annoyance at the interruption of their slumber.

Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, threatening to rip the ancient oak tree by the gate from its roots. Esme knew that meant trouble â€“ probably a stray cat seeking shelter or, worse, an injured bird caught in the storm's fury. She sighed, wiping her hands on her apron, and glanced towards the old grandfather clock ticking away in the corner. It was almost midnight.

Just as she reached for her raincoat, a sharp rapping on the door startled her.  Who would be out in this weather?
