The acrid sting of smoke filled Elias Finnigan's nostrils as he wrestled with the tangled fire hose. Flames roared behind him, licking hungrily at the boarded windows of the abandoned warehouse. The heat was an oppressive beast, radiating off the warped metal walls and threatening to consume everything in its path. 

Elias grimaced, pulling harder on the hose, his muscles burning with exertion. He could hear Captain Reynolds' gruff voice barking orders through the crackling static of his radio. "Finnigan! Get that line secured! We need water on those back rooms!" Elias knew this building like the back of his hand â€“ a childhood haunt for daredevil explorations and graffiti art. Now, it was a raging inferno, its charred bones spitting sparks into the night sky.
