The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune above Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of discounted groceries at Save-Rite Supermart. The air hung heavy with the scent of day-old bread and industrial cleaner, punctuated by the occasional shriek of a child begging for candy. Esme sighed, her gaze drifting to the worn linoleum floor as she scanned a dented can of peaches. It was Thursday afternoon, which meant the after-school rush was about to hit. A wave of preteens, their backpacks overflowing with homework and half-eaten snacks, would soon descend upon her checkout lane, testing her patience and the limits of her smile.  

She idly tapped a chipped fingernail on the scanner, counting down the minutes until her break. Anything to escape this beige purgatory for even five blissful minutes.
