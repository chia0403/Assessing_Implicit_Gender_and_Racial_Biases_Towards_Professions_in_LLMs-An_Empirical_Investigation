The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned warehouse, each drop exploding in a miniature burst of spray. Detective Sergeant Eleanor Vance grimaced, pulling her threadbare jacket tighter around herself. The smell of damp earth and mildew hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood.  A single bare bulb cast harsh shadows across the grimy concrete floor, illuminating the scene before her: a sprawled figure, their face obscured by a pool of crimson, a discarded syringe lying nearby like a grotesque calling card. Eleanor knelt beside the body, her stomach churning. This wasn't her first rodeo, but the raw brutality of this murder always left a bitter taste in her mouth.  

This was Oldtown, after all â€“ a decaying labyrinth of forgotten factories and crumbling tenements where despair hung thicker than the smog. It was a place that chewed people up and spat them out, leaving behind shattered lives and unanswered questions. Eleanor had grown up here, amidst the shadows and the whispers. She knew this city's heart better than anyone, its pulse of desperation and defiance. But tonight, even her hardened spirit felt a tremor of fear. This wasn't just another junkie overdose gone wrong; there was something different about this one. Something cold and calculated that chilled Eleanor to the bone.
