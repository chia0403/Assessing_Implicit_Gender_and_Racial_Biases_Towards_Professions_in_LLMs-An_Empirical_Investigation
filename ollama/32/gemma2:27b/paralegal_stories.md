Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's cramped office cubicle. The flickering fluorescent lights cast an anemic glow over stacks of legal briefs threatening to engulf her desk. Ellie, a woman whose sharp wit and even sharper cheekbones were perpetually hidden behind thick-rimmed glasses and a no-nonsense ponytail, sighed deeply. Another late night at the firm, another mountain of paperwork demanding her attention. 

She was working on the Peterson case - a messy divorce involving accusations of infidelity, hidden assets, and enough bitterness to curdle milk. Ellie tapped her pen against the table, her mind replaying the heated exchanges she'd witnessed during the initial depositions. Something about Mr. Peterson's evasive answers and Mrs. Peterson's icy glare felt off, like pieces of a puzzle that didn't quite fit.  Ellie had a hunch there was more to this case than met the eye, but her intuition rarely held sway in the cutthroat world of corporate law. 


The setting: A dimly lit, cramped office cubicle within a bustling law firm located in downtown Chicago. The year is 2023.
