Rain lashed against the gothic windows of Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's office, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the weathered stone sill. The scent of old books and damp earth permeated the air, punctuated by the faint, metallic tang of Ellie's anxiety. She sat perched on the edge of her antique leather armchair, a worn copy of Freud's "Interpretation of Dreams" lying open but unread on her lap. 

Her waiting room, usually bustling with nervous anticipation, was eerily silent tonight. Only a lone grandfather clock ticked away in the corner, its rhythmic clang echoing the tumult brewing within Ellie. She was expecting a patient unlike any she had encountered before â€“ a man claiming to have visions of the future. Was he delusional? A cunning manipulator? Or something altogether more extraordinary? 

Ellie rose, smoothing down her tweed skirt and taking a steadying breath. The grandfather clock chimed eight times, its resonant gong a call to face the unknown. She walked towards the heavy oak door leading to the waiting room, her heart pounding in her chest like a trapped bird. This wasn't just another case; it felt like a precipice, the edge of something profound and potentially terrifying.
