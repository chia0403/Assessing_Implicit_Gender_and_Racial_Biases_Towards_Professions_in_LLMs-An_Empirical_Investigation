The flickering gas lamps cast dancing shadows across the worn stone of the Grand Citadel's outer courtyard. A biting wind whipped through the gaps in the iron bars surrounding the fountain, sending shivers down the spine of  Sir Alistair Thorne, a veteran guard known for his stoic demeanor and unwavering loyalty to King Alaric. His thick chainmail armor, more suited to guarding against the cold of a winter's night than the scorching summer sun, offered little comfort against the stifling humidity that seemed to cling to him like a second skin. 

Sir Alistair stood silently, his gaze fixed on the sprawling city beyond the fortified walls. The Citadel, once a bastion of hope and progress for the young kingdom, was now shrouded in an atmosphere of unease. Whispers of unrest echoed within the stone corridors; whispers that spoke of an approaching storm more ominous than any weather phenomena.  He felt a familiar knot tighten in his gut – a feeling that whispered of danger lurking just beyond sight. 

It was a feeling that gnawed at him, particularly today. It wasn't merely the unsettling silence, nor the way the usually vibrant tapestry of life seemed muted and strained.  Something about the King’s demeanor, the way he would pace his chambers before dawn, or the ever-present tension in his voice when addressing his advisors, sent a ripple of unease through the castle. 

Tonight, however, was supposed to be different. Tonight was the night that Alistair's watch began. The night he and the other guards were tasked with leading the King into a grand celebration - a symbolic act that should appease the growing discontent of the populace. But as Alistair walked towards the main gate, his mind felt heavy, burdened by a premonition that something terrible was about to unfold.
