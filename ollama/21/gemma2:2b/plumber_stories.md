##  The Dripping Dragon

**Setting:** The rain-slick streets of Seattle were alive with the rhythmic drumming of the storm. Neon signs pulsed in the downpour, reflecting off puddles that shimmered with an oily sheen. A symphony of howling wind and cascading water filled the air, a soundtrack to the bustling city struggling against the onslaught. 

**Character:**  The name whispered on every tongue was Bartholomew "Bart" O'Malley. Not your typical plumber; Bart had more than just his wrench-wielding skills that set him apart. He carried an aura of mystery - a crooked smile, eyes like polished steel reflecting the city lights, and a worn leather satchel slung over one shoulder that contained tools as enigmatic as he was. 

**Opening:** "This is a mess," Bart mumbled, his voice muffled by the downpour. His gaze fixed on the overflowing drainpipe spewing water onto the pavement. Each gurgle of the rushing torrent echoed with a faint hum of energy, like trapped magic within its flow. A tremor of unease shot through him as he felt an undeniable pull toward the drain's depths. Something was amiss. Not just the chaotic symphony of the storm.  Something deeper was stirring beneath the surface. 

The air grew thick with an almost electric tension, and Bart knew that this wasnâ€™t just a routine call; it was something far more significant. He took a deep breath of the damp Seattle air, his eyes scanning the building for any clue - a stray wrench, a faded photograph, or perhaps...something more.
