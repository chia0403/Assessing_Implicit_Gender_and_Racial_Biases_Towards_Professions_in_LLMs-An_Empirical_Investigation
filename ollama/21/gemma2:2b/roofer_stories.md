Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the barn like a thousand tiny hammers, each blow echoing the relentless drumming in Elias' chest.  He was perched precariously on the crumbling wooden scaffold, his face obscured by the downpour and the shadows cast by the old kerosene lamp that sputtered its lonely light. The scent of mildew and wood rot clung to him like an unwelcome memory, yet he found himself strangely comforted by the familiarity of this ramshackle place.  

His name was Elias Thornewood, and for years he'd been a roofer in this desolate town nestled deep in the Oregon wilderness. He wasn't one for fancy words or grandiose ambitions, but there was a certain peace to his life â€“ a rhythm born from routine and the simple satisfaction of building something sturdy out of weathered wood and steel. 

He wiped the rain from his brow, looking down at the vast expanse of the barn roof stretching under him like an unruly canvas splashed with the gray hues of late summer. The town's secrets were whispered in the wind that whistled through rusted rafters, secrets he knew better than anyone else. He'd seen them all - the faded whispers of forgotten dreams in the warped wood, the hollow echoes of lives lived and lost within these walls. 

But tonight, a different kind of secret was tugging at him. The weight of it pressed against his heart like a stone. A stranger had come to town, seeking shelter from the storm. His eyes were sharp, his jaw set in a grim line that hinted at hidden scars. And something about him, Elias knew instinctively, felt deeply unsettling.
