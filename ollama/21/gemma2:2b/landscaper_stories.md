Rain hammered against the canvas tarp stretched over his shoulders as Liam "Leaf" Callahan surveyed the battlefield: the overgrown backyard of Mrs. Henderson's sprawling Victorian estate.  He hated this kind of work. The rich families of Maplewood seemed to think their manicured lawns were an art form, a tapestry woven with carefully chosen blades of grass and pruned hedges that could make a saint weep. Liam, on the other hand, found solace in the untamed wildness of nature he brought back from his grandfather's old orchard in Vermont. But Mrs. Henderson’s yard, with its suffocating precision and sterile formality, was like a forced smile upon a withered face.  

"Mr. Callahan?" A voice as crisp and sharp as newly-cut ice crackled through the rain. It was Henry Davis, her personal gardener, standing on the porch steps adorned with a polished brass railing that looked more suited to a grand ballroom than a backyard in Maplewood. "Just a little… persuasion for your masterpiece," he said, gesturing towards the wilting rose bushes that refused to bloom amidst a sea of meticulously trimmed lawn grass.
