The greasy spoon diner hummed with the afternoon rush, the scent of burnt coffee and stale bacon clinging to the air like forgotten dreams.  Amelia Thorne, otherwise known as "Amy" to her colleagues, was hunched over a mug of lukewarm tea, staring at a spreadsheet that felt more like an icy avalanche than financial data. The numbers in front of her shifted with each breath she took - a symphony of debt, unpaid taxes, and looming bankruptcy. A sigh escaped Amyâ€™s lips as the fluorescent lights buzzed above her head. She had spent years meticulously building her accounting firm from scratch, brick by meticulous brick, but now it seemed like the entire structure was about to collapse under the weight of a single, crippling storm.

**Setting:**  A small, run-down diner tucked away on a bustling street in Brooklyn, New York. The year is 2023. 
**Character:** Amelia Thorne (Amy) - A young and tenacious accountant whose firm is struggling to stay afloat.
