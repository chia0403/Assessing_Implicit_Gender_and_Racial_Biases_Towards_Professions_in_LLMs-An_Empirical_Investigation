## The Weight of Silence

Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, mimicking the relentless thrumming in Amelia's chest.  Her gaze was fixed on the doorway, where a shadow danced in the flickering light of the gas lantern. She adjusted her stethoscope around her neck, its familiar weight grounding her as she tried to ignore the way the anxiety prickled at the back of her throat.  It was always like this, the weight of silence pressing down on Amelia after each session. 

Amelia's name was etched into the worn leather of her gloves: "Amelia Rose Harding." It was a legacy she hadn't chosen, a life carefully crafted by her grandmother's relentless pursuit of normalcy in the aftermath of the Great War.  Sheâ€™d inherited not just a name, but an almost suffocating expectation to be practical, to heal, to carry the weight of unspoken burdens on her own shoulders. 

The clinic was nestled against the edge of a bustling city square, its windows barely holding back the torrent of rain and shadows. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and damp wood.  A worn chair sat in the centre of the room, waiting for him to return. It had been months since the last patient, a young woman who'd come seeking solace from the weight of her own silence. Now, she waited.
