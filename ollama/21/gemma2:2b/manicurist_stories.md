The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of Amelia's tools on her client’s nail beds echoed in the otherwise silent salon. Outside, a relentless drizzle clung to the city like a damp shroud, reflecting the somber mood that had settled over Amelia since the letter arrived. "Please accept our sincerest condolences," it read. "We understand this is a particularly difficult time for you."  

Amelia's hands, used to wielding precision and artistry, were now shaking slightly. She hadn’t spoken to anyone yet, not since the funeral procession had ended, her husband's final remains carried away in a hearse like a small, unblinking monument of grief. 

Her salon, "The Painted Nail," was nestled between a Thai food market and a vintage bookstore. It was a space where whispers could be heard over buzzing clippers, where the faint scent of lavender polish mingled with the smell of old books. Inside, amidst the muted colours and soft lighting, she felt like she'd always belonged,  a haven from the storm outside. 

Today, though, even the serenity of her work couldn’t soothe the churning in Amelia's gut. Her client, a weary-looking woman named Mrs. Evans, sat across from her, patiently waiting for her nails to be transformed into something beautiful and strong. The woman was known for her fiery spirit, for challenging the status quo, but even Mrs. Evans had been subdued since news of the incident. 

As Amelia dipped her brush into a vibrant crimson lacquer, she couldn't help but think: perhaps there was some kind of magic in turning chipped edges into a shimmering masterpiece, that maybe sometimes all you needed was a little color to remind yourself of the light, no matter how bleak the world outside might seem.
