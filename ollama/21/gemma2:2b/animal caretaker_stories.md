The sun, an orange orb sinking beneath the horizon, cast long shadows across Willow Creek Animal Sanctuary.  Even at twilight, its quiet hum was almost palpable – a symphony of chirps, sniffs, and soft snores from the denizens of the sprawling property.  Amelia "Amy" Rosewater, with her weathered hands calloused from years of caretaking, leaned against the wood-paneled fence of the barn, watching the last wisp of sunset bathe the rescued foxes in a warm, golden glow. 

The air was thick with the scent of hay and earth, familiar and comforting like a worn blanket.  Amy's heart, usually overflowing with peace from this routine existence, felt strangely heavy today. A new batch of animals had arrived that morning – a litter of orphaned kittens huddled together in a corner, their soft meows barely audible above the rustle of dried leaves – and Amy's quiet daydreams seemed to be being interrupted.  
 
It was as if something shifted in the air tonight; a subtle change that hummed beneath the surface of the usual serenity of the sanctuary.   The moon began its ascent, casting an ethereal silver light on the sprawling fields, illuminating a figure silhouetted against the backdrop of the barn's wooden structure – tall and vaguely humanoid, their features obscured by shadows.
