The whirring of the ultrasonic cleaner was like a lullaby to Amelia Jones, her hands gently maneuvering between the rows of gleaming white teeth. Outside, the San Francisco fog swirled around the building, blurring the lines between reality and dream with its ever-shifting forms. It was that time again - the hour before closing when the clinic's gentle hum became a symphony of hushed whispers and nervous coughs in her ear.  But for Amelia, the comforting routine wasn’t just about dental hygiene; it felt like a ritual she'd carved out of her life to keep the edges of reality sharp. 

It wasn't easy. The world outside the clinic was a swirling vortex of chaos – political unrest, financial woes, and whispered secrets that echoed through the crowded streets like phantom voices. Her own private life mirrored this turmoil – a messy love affair with an unfaithful artist, a stubborn refusal to move out of her mother's apartment, and a gnawing fear she couldn't shake off about the future.
