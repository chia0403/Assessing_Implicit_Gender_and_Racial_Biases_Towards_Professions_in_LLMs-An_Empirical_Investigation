## The Setting:

**A.M. Clinic:** Nestled in the heart of the bustling city of New Haven, Connecticut, A.M. Clinic was a monument to practicality.  Built upon the foundation of Dr. Amelia Mooreâ€™s late father's practice, it housed not just a doctor but also a phlebotomy center, a testament to the family's dedication to accessible healthcare. The clinic itself had aged beautifully - its worn mahogany reception desk and well-loved examination rooms whispered tales of generations served, while a vintage record player hummed a soothing jazz melody beneath the soft fluorescent lights.  

**B. Main Character:**

* **Name:** Evelyn "Eve" Carter
    * **Age:** 34
    * **Personality:** Eve was quiet and observant, with a calming presence that always seemed to soothe even the most anxious patient. Though her hands were steady as she skillfully drew blood, her heart yearned for something beyond the routine of drawing vials.

**Opening Scene:**

Eve's reflection stared back at her from the stainless steel sink, her eyes shadowed by exhaustion.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, their harsh glare doing little to dispel the weariness that clung to her like a second skin. Tonight's schedule had been brutal - a marathon of anxious patients and needles.  A sense of melancholic calm settled over Eve as she finished washing her hands. Her usual late-night coffee was nowhere in sight; the thought of it seemed more distant than ever before. 

"Just one more hour," she whispered, her voice echoing through the empty room. "Then tomorrow will be a new day."  She tucked a strand of dark hair behind her ear and took a deep breath. The familiar scent of antiseptic and the faint whisper of blood still lingered in the air; a reminder of the delicate dance between humanity and science that she embraced as her profession, her life.
