The worn brass handle glinted dully under the dim lamplight as Amelia straightened her apron, its fabric dusty from years of dusting and cleaning. The air in the Blackwood Manor hung thick with dust and the faint scent of decay – an unwelcome cocktail that had become all too familiar to her over the past decade.  A century-old mansion perched on a hill overlooking a desolate moor, it was hardly the picture of domestic bliss, and Amelia, known affectionately as Millie by the staff, was its undisputed queen of chaos. 

The Blackwood children, twins named Jasper and Iris, were as different as chalk and cheese – their personalities mirroring the stark landscape itself.  Jasper, with his steely grey eyes and a mop of unruly hair, often seemed to disappear into his room, leaving a trail of unraveled threads and forgotten ambitions behind him. Iris, on the other hand, was a vibrant whirlwind of colour and noise, flitting around the house with an impish grin and a boundless energy that kept Millie perpetually behind schedule. 

Today's chore list seemed like it had been written in ancient runes: dust every inch of the vast library, polish the tarnished silver collection to a blinding shine, and prepare the grand dining room for an annual family dinner - all by dusk.  But as Millie surveyed the daunting task ahead, she couldn't help but feel a flicker of something unfamiliar: hope. Perhaps it was the faint aroma of jasmine that clung to the fading evening breeze or the way the sunlight danced across the peeling wallpaper, reminding her of a forgotten summer. She sighed – even a haunted manor could hold some beauty if one dared to look for it.
