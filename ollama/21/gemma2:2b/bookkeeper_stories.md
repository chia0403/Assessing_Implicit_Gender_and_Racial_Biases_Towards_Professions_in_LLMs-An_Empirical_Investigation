The rain hammered against the windows of Elias Thorne’s office like tiny fists trying to punch through the panes. A mournful wind howled around the old Victorian building, its groans echoing Elias' growing unease.

He was just a bookkeeper, tasked with keeping the Manor's intricate financial world afloat, navigating its treacherous currents of debt and intrigue. Yet, lately, Elias felt an undercurrent of unease – like a storm brewing in the quiet heart of the manor that threatened to engulf him whole.
