The sun bled across the endless plains, painting streaks of fiery orange and deep violet onto Jebediah's worn leather hat. He squinted at the horizon, a familiar ache thrumming in his shoulders as he surveyed his cattle herd. The vast expanse stretched before him, dotted with dusty green patches that promised meager rain this late spring. 

Jebediah was one of the last holdouts, clinging to the weathered traditions of his family's cattle ranch for generations. He'd inherited their sprawling property and a legacy heavier than any saddle leather, his father's words echoing in his mind: "This land ain't just soil, boy. It's your heartbeat."  

He adjusted the reins of his trusty mare, her fur as dusty as the earth beneath his boots. The air hung heavy with the scent of sagebrush and dry wood smoke, a constant reminder of the unforgiving desert that surrounded them. His cattle, weary from the scorching summer sun, stood huddled near the water trough, their breath misting in the arid wind. 

Even the shadows seemed to whisper secrets under the relentless gaze of the sun. Jebediah knew there was more at stake than just surviving this dry spell; he felt a responsibility to carry on the mantle of his ancestors, and for that, he needed answers from the land itself.
