The morning mist clung to Willow Creek like a lover's embrace, obscuring the usually vibrant sunrise in a veil of pale gray. Inside "Bloom & Bloom," Elara Thorne, her auburn hair pulled back tightly from her forehead, carefully adjusted the delicate buds of lilac that she was weaving into a bouquet.  Her shop, nestled between an antique bookstore and a bustling bakery, always seemed to hold its breath on these days, waiting for something to break free of the quiet fog. It had been weeks since anyone had dared to cross Willow Creek's threshold for anything other than necessities - too many rumors about the missing postman and whispers of strange things in the woods surrounding the town.  Elara knew she shouldnâ€™t be letting fear hold her back, not with a new shipment of roses just arriving from the coast this afternoon. 

But lately, even the scent of fresh lilies and rose petals seemed to carry an edge of unease.  The townsfolk, usually so eager for a reason to celebrate, were hesitant now. Elara, with her heart as much in the flowers she crafted as in her quaint shop, was starting to wonder if there would be anything left to bloom by the time the season truly began.
