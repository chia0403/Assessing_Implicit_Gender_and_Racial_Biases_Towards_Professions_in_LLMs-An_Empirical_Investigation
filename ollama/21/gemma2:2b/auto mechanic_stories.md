The smell of gasoline and hot oil hung thick in the air, clinging to Daniel's worn leather apron like an unwelcome second skin. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated window of "Danny’s Garage," illuminating the chaos of his workshop: half-disassembled lawnmowers, a sputtering motorcycle with flames painted on its tank, and a pile of spare tires threatening to topple over.  It was 7:00 AM on a Wednesday, and Danny, at the young age of 25, already felt the familiar buzz of adrenaline coursing through his veins as he surveyed the day's work list: Mrs. Johnson's '67 Chevy Impala, a rusty old truck belonging to Mr. Henderson, and an electric scooter that looked suspiciously like a miniature UFO.

Danny wasn’t your typical mechanic; he saw more stories in the rust of a car than most people saw in their lives. His world was one of gears, oil, and worn-out dreams -  a place where each engine's growl whispered secrets of long gone journeys. He knew these stories because his dad, an old-timer who had breathed life into countless automobiles before him, had instilled a love for the craft that burned brightly within Danny.
