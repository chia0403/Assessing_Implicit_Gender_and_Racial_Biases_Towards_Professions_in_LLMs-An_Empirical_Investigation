The rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Elias Thorne's office like tiny fists pounding on a weathered door. The rhythmic drumming was almost soothing, until it wasn’t.  Elias, with his sharp hazel eyes that seemed to see through even the most carefully constructed facades, surveyed the stormy landscape outside. He adjusted the worn leather chair for Mrs. O’Malley, whose anxiety was palpable as she clutched her purse like a shield. 

“It's just a storm,” he said gently, attempting to mask the tremor in his own voice that mirrored the rain itself.  He knew better than most how storms brewed inside people, their anxieties, regrets and desires swirling in a tempest of their own making. He was Elias Thorne, a counseling psychologist whose practice was as much an art as it was science - a craft honed by years of listening to the stories of humanity’s triumphs and failures alike.

Mrs. O'Malley was here for the second time this week.  Her husband had passed away only last month and she was struggling to navigate the treacherous waters of grief, her usual sense of purpose now tossed about like a discarded toy in the storm.   Elias knew there were things he couldn’t fix, but tonight, just as the wind howled outside his window, he hoped he could help weather this tempest with Mrs. O'Malley.
