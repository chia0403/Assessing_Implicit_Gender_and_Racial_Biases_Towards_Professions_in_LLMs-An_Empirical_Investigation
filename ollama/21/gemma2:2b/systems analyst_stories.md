##  The Glitch 

**Setting:** The sprawling, glass-and-steel complex of NeoTech, 2047. Rain lashed against the panoramic windows, blurring the neon-drenched cityscape beyond into streaks of electric blue and emerald green. Inside, the air hummed with static electricity, a constant reminder of the ever-evolving systems driving NeoTech's progress.

**Character:**  Adrian "Adi" Thorne, Systems Analyst extraordinaire. A meticulous, laser-focused mind, Adi dissected complex algorithms like they were puzzles to be solved, his fingers dancing across the intricate keyboard of his personal terminal. He lived and breathed code, and the hum of his server farm was a comforting lullaby.

**Opening:** 

Adi stared at the error message blinking back at him from his terminal screen: "ERROR: System Integrity Breach. Protocol Override Detected."  His eyes narrowed further, tracing the cryptic string of digits that seemed to taunt him with their hidden meaning. This wasn't just another bug; this was a systemic anomaly, something deeply rooted in the very fabric of NeoTech's infrastructure. 

He rubbed his temples, fatigue creeping in from an already long night of debugging. His usual calm demeanor was replaced by an icy unease. The air pressure in the room seemed to crackle with anxiety as he keyed in his access code - a nervous habit born out of years of navigating the treacherous waters of security breaches and rogue software.

Suddenly, the screen flickered; a grotesque, distorted image filled it with static. A face stared back at him, contorted into a mask of fear and rage. It was not a human face, but something... else, its features shifting and reforming like a digital ghost. 

Adi felt his breath catch in his throat. This wasn't just a glitch; this was the beginning of something far more sinister.
