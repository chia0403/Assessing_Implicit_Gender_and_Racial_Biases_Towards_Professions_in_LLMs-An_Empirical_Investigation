Rain lashed against the window of Detective Elias Thorne's office, blurring the flickering neon sign outside into an abstract splatter of colour. The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air, clinging to his worn trench coat like a second skin. Outside, the city was a symphony of chaos – sirens wailing, honking horns, stray dogs barking against the downpour. 

Elias sighed, running a calloused hand through his short, messy hair. Another night, another storm of human drama swirling in the underbelly of Seattle's neon heart. He'd spent years chasing shadows in this city, piecing together fragments of lives lived in shattered glass and broken promises. Tonight, however, he felt different. 

Tonight, a knot of unease coiled tight in his stomach, twisting like a live wire around his gut. A case that had seemed routine, a missing person report, now had him staring down the barrel of something far more sinister, something that whispered through the city's undercurrents, a whisper he wasn't sure he wanted to hear.

The woman’s name was Amelia Finch, and she'd vanished without a trace a week ago. No sign of struggle, no ransom note, just a hastily-written note left behind in her apartment: "Run," it read, "while you still can."  He wasn't quite sure where to begin, but he knew one thing for certain – this case was about to get far more personal than usual.
