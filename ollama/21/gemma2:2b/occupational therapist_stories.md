The air in Dr. Amelia Croft's clinic was thick with the scent of peppermint and the quiet hum of medical machines. The walls were adorned with bright artwork created by her young patients â€“ abstract splatter paintings reflecting their unfiltered joy. Sunlight streamed through the expansive windows, illuminating rows of meticulously organized exercise equipment: weighted balls, resistance bands, even a small bouncy castle that seemed to defy gravity.

Amelia, known affectionately as "Amy" by both colleagues and families, was used to this quiet symphony of recovery.  She navigated a world where limitations were overcome with determination and sometimes just a little bit of playful chaos. Today, however, the usual peace was disrupted. A sharp intake of breath echoed through the room as she watched a young boy named Ethan, his face contorted in fear, struggle to lift his tiny cast-covered hand.  His eyes darted between Amelia and his mother, who sat beside him with an exhausted frown. 


The scene had opened like a book waiting for an exciting chapter.
