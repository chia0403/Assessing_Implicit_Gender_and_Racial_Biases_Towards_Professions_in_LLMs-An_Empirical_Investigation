Rain hammered against the windshield, blurring the already hazy cityscape into a watercolour mess as Amelia “Amy” Hawthorne wrestled with the stubborn bolt on her lunch box. It was another brutal July afternoon in the heart of the Mojave Desert - a place where even the wind carried the grit and dust of the vast emptiness. 

The roar of trucks pulling out from the nearby construction site filled the air, punctuated by the occasional screech of metal on metal as a crew shifted around the heavy equipment. Amy, stationed at the side of Highway 108, was one hand digging into her thick, leather-bound work gloves to grip the wrench tighter. The other hand worked feverishly, trying to pry open the latches of her lunch box. It was an old relic from a time when metal lunches and paper trays were still the norm, not fancy insulated containers with built-in chargers and Bluetooth speakers. 

The sun, already dipping towards the unforgiving desert horizon, cast long shadows across the worksite. The heat lingered, clinging to Amy like a stubborn ghost as she finally managed to pry open the box, revealing the battered contents of her lunch: a ham sandwich, two limp apples, a thermos of lukewarm coffee, and a worn copy of “The Odyssey” tucked inside.
