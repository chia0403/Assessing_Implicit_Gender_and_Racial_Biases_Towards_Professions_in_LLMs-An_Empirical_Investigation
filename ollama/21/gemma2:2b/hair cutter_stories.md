The late afternoon sun bled through the worn-down windowpane, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. A melody from an old radio played faintly, the tune seeming to echo the quiet rhythm of the barber chair as it creaked slightly under Amelia "Amy" Carter's nimble fingers. Her small shop, nestled on a cobblestone street with faded grandeur and whispering history, hummed with the barely perceptible buzz of hair clippers and the gentle rustle of fabric against wood. 

For over forty years, Amy had presided over this corner of town, her scissors a familiar symphony of sharp precision, transforming men into their best selves through carefully crafted cuts and whispered advice. The city's rhythm was woven into the very fabric of her shop: the hurried pace of lunchtime crowds flowing in and out like waves on a shore, the lingering aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the faint scent of aftershave from regulars who’d return for their weekly touch-ups. 

Today, however, an unsettling air lingered around Amelia. A man with eyes that reflected the storm clouds gathering overhead sat across from her in the chair. His hair, a wild mane once, was now a tangled mess.  He kept glancing down at his hands, as if searching for something he couldn’t find.
