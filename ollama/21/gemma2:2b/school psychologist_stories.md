## Story Opening

**Setting:** A quaint, almost idyllic coastal town nestled against a sprawling redwood forest in Northern California. The air is thick with salt spray and the promise of rain. 

**Main Character:** Dr. Amelia "Amy" Pierce, a sharp-witted, yet eternally optimistic school psychologist for the Redwood Pines High School. She runs through the hallways each morning before the school bell rings, her presence as comforting as the familiar scent of old books from the library. Amy is known for her unique blend of clinical expertise and genuine warmth - she’s not just a counselor; she's a confidante to teenagers facing a world that can feel overwhelmingly overwhelming. 

**Opening Scene:**  The smell of burnt coffee hangs heavy in the air as Amy settles into her chair, its worn leather creaking with every movement. The afternoon sun, filtered through the stained glass window, paints a kaleidoscope of colours across the floor – from vibrant reds to muted blues and soft greens. It’s the start of another day at Redwood Pines High, and Amy already feels the weight of unspoken anxieties and hopes swirling around her. A student's frantic voice echoes from the hallway - "She ran out! My mom is going through withdrawals again!"  

**Amy sighs**, a familiar mixture of concern and resignation settling in her chest. Another day, another wave of teenage drama to navigate. 


**End Scene:** The words "Another day" hang heavy on Amy's lips as she catches sight of the crumpled note left on her desk – an invitation to a local festival, promising music, food, and perhaps, just perhaps, some respite from the daily storm brewing in Redwood Pines.
