The desert wind whipped Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's worn leather jacket around her like a phantom, its icy fingers clawing at her bare arms as she surveyed the construction site. Dust devils danced across the ochre expanse, swirling in silent fury against the backdrop of towering steel skeleton structures that would eventually pierce the sky.  She sat on the rusted hulk of a bulldozer named "Betty" - a relic from a time before their little project dared to dream of reaching for the clouds.  Amy adjusted her welding mask and squinted through the gritty haze, chewing on a piece of hardtack. 

It was brutal out here. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the air into shimmering amber waves, while the relentless wind carved harsh cuts into her already worn features. Yet, with every creak and groan of the machinery, Amy felt a strange sense of satisfaction.  She was home here, amongst the giants she could command, in this vast emptiness where nature had laid bare the raw potential of human ambition. This wasn't just about moving dirt; it was about building something that would reach beyond the horizon, leaving its mark on time itself.
