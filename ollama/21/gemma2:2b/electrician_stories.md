## Setting: 

The flickering neon sign outside "The Rusty Sprocket" cast a greasy orange glow across the rain-slicked asphalt. The air was thick with the smell of stale beer and burnt grease, punctuated by the rhythmic clanging of an old jukebox in the corner. This ramshackle bar, tucked away on a forgotten side street, housed more secrets than the city's history textbooks ever knew. 

## Character:

**Jasper "Sparks" Thorne** was a man who understood the language of electricity like he could read a book. He was everything his name hinted at - wiry and quick, with eyes that sparkled as fiercely as his work. The wrinkles around his eyes deepened by years spent under flickering fluorescent lights, hinting at stories untold, but one thing about Sparks never faltered: his unwavering focus on the electrifying dance of power. 


## Story Opening:

Jasper “Sparks” Thorne hunched over the busted wiring of an old boiler in the back room of The Rusty Sprocket. Rain hammered against the leaky roof, a symphony for a weary soul. He’d been here for three days, tangled in a maze of copper and metal - just another Tuesday night at his usual haunt.  Sparks tapped on the last meter with a sigh, frustration radiating off him in waves. "Come on," he muttered to himself, his fingers tracing the charred remnants of last week's failed repair.

The door creaked open, revealing Mrs. Henderson, the bar’s owner, her silhouette barely illuminated by the dim red glow of the jukebox.  "Jasper, you're a sight for sore eyes." she drawled, placing a steaming cup in his hands. "A mug of your usual, eh?" 

Sparks took a sip, the bitter brew burning a familiar trail down his throat. The air hung heavy with unspoken tension, and Mrs. Henderson's eyes held a glint he couldn’t quite read.  "Something on my mind," she said, leaning closer, "and a job that needs doing." 

 Sparks felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise. There was an undercurrent to her words, something deeper than just another repair bill. A storm brewing somewhere, and he had yet to decipher the meaning of its thunderous roar.
