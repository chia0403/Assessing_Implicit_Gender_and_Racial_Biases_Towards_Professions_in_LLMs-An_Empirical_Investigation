Rain hammered against the roof of Dr. Amelia Blackwood's clinic like a thousand tiny fists pounding on wood. The wind howled outside, carrying with it the scent of salt and seaweed from the nearby beach.  Inside, however, the air hung thick and warm, smelling faintly of disinfectant and a hint of lavender – Amelia’s favorite calming essential oil. Her gaze drifted to the reflection in the stainless steel sink, her own tired eyes shadowed by the dim light of the room. Tonight, like every night for the past two weeks, she felt utterly outmatched.  The storm had not only unleashed a torrent of rain but also an avalanche of unexpected cases: a feral cat with rabies, a dog missing its leg, and a flock of rare birds suffering from a strange ailment. The weight of it all seemed to press down on Amelia like the heavy silence after each vet appointment. 

Amelia ran her hand through her auburn hair, feeling the familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. She'd dreamed of a peaceful life working with animals, rescuing them from harm and alleviating their suffering. The idyllic image had been shattered when she discovered that running a clinic for small mammals in this storm-battered coastal town was less about compassion and more about sheer grit and an endless supply of courage.
