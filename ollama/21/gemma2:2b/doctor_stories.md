The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Dr. Amelia Vance's crisp white coat like an unwanted shroud.  She stood on the cracked tarmac of the remote airstrip, the only sound her worn boots crunching on gravel and the distant drone of cicadas. The jungle canopy above, a symphony of green and crimson, pressed in, threatening to swallow the flimsy airstrip whole. It was supposed to be paradise, a haven for wildlife research and healing for the isolated indigenous tribes.  Instead, it felt like an unwelcome prison for a woman who'd traded her penthouse views for a canvas painted with the scent of decay and the cries of unseen creatures.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the makeshift camp, turning the usual vibrant greens into a bruised mosaic of colour. Amelia's gaze snagged on the weathered door to the infirmary â€“ a single light flickered from within.  She'd been here for two weeks now, her mission to tend to the tribal elders after a sudden outbreak of a strange illness, one that seemed as elusive as its cause. Her colleagues back in the city had already declared it 'nothing' - some sort of natural fever - but Amelia knew better. There was something more, something deeper, lurking beneath the surface.  She was determined to find it before the jungle swallowed it whole and left a stain on history that wouldn't wash off easily.
