The air hung thick with the musk of blood and cured meats in the cramped back alley behind Peterson's Meat Market.  It was an aroma both repulsive to most and strangely comforting to Elias "El" Thorne, owner and operator of the establishment since his grandfather's retirement. El wasn't like other butchers; he didn't dream of fine cuts or high-falutin' sauces, he dreamed of making meat sing - coaxing out every ounce of its primal joy in each perfectly seasoned chop.  He stood behind a monstrous steel counter cluttered with cleavers and knives, the butcher block beneath his calloused fingers stained with years of sacrifice and blood. It was on this night, the first full moon of autumn, that El knew something was different; a shiver ran down his spine as he looked at the door's newly-installed, ornate brass handle.  It wasn't just another customer walking in - it felt like the beginning of an entirely new chapter. 


 **Setting:** A bustling city street corner, but behind the market, an alleyway hidden from view. The air smells of cured meat and sweat, with a faint trace of rain.

**Character:** Elias "El" Thorne, known for his love for meat and his unique approach to butchering.  He's a man built like a bear - strong yet gentle, with weathered hands that seem to hold the stories of every animal heâ€™s ever touched. He's got a heart full of passion for his craft but also a quiet loneliness that makes him crave something more.
