The salt-laden wind whipped through Silas Hawthorne's hair, carrying with it the scent of brine and something else - an unsettling note of decay.  He squinted across the vast stretch of his family farm, weathered barn in the foreground like a forgotten relic against the setting sun. It had been generations since any other soul graced these fields, not since his great-grandfather's stories about the whispers on the wind and shadows that danced at dusk. The only company Silas had was the stubborn crows circling overhead, their dark eyes gleaming with an unsettling intelligence.  His worn boots crunched over dry earth as he made his way towards the weathered oak door of his barn, each step a weary echo in the vast emptiness.
