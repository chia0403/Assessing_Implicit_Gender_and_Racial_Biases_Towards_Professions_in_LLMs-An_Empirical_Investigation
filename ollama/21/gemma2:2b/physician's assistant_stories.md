## The Smoke Ring

**Setting:**  A bustling emergency room in a ramshackle city hospital on the edge of the Mississippi Delta. August air hangs thick with humidity, punctuated by the low drone of cicadas and the rhythmic hum of fluorescent lights. 

**Character:** Cassandra "Cassie" Moreau, her fingers still stained crimson from drawing blood for the tenth time that night, felt a familiar weariness settle into her bones. Her crisp white scrub pants felt too tight after three consecutive nights on call, a constant reminder of the weight she carried each day â€“ not just as a physician's assistant, but also as the sole lifeline to hope in this forgotten corner of America.

The air itself seemed heavy tonight, laden with an undercurrent of anxiety. The smell of disinfectant clung to everything, masking the more potent aroma of fear that permeated the room like smoke seeping through cracks in the walls. A young girl, no older than five, lay on a gurney, her small frame seemingly wilting under the sterile white sheets. Her mother sobbed softly beside her, clutching at thin air with shaking hands, her face etched with terror.

Cassie's heart beat against her ribs like a trapped bird. She wasn't sure if it was the fear she saw reflected in the girl's eyes or the way they both seemed to be watching something unseen, but it left her feeling like a shadow clinging to the edge of a nightmare.
