The midday sun beat down on Havana like a blacksmith's hammer, turning the cobblestones to molten pools. Even the normally vibrant street vendors seemed subdued, their colorful wares barely catching the eye beneath the oppressive heat. The air hung heavy with the scent of frying plantains and jasmine, a fragrance that usually brought comfort, but today felt stifling, almost suffocating.

Carmen Esperanza Garcia, known to most as Espe, sat hunched over her battered typewriter in the back room of La Flor del Café, her fingers flying across the keys. She was chasing a story, one that felt bigger than herself, bigger even than this sprawling city she called home. It was about corruption, whispers swirling through the underbelly of Havana, rumors of deals made in shadowy corners and secrets buried deep beneath layers of bureaucracy.

Espe wasn't sure if she believed it all yet, but her gut churned with a familiar unease – the kind that had always propelled her forward, pushing her to unravel the truth, no matter how dangerous it might be. She glanced at the faded photograph pinned above her typewriter: her grandfather, a revolutionary writer who had vanished without a trace decades ago. His story fueled Espe’s own, a burning desire for justice and an unwavering commitment to exposing the darkness that threatened to consume them all.
