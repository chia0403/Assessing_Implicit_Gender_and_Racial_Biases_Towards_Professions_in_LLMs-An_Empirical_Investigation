The antiseptic scent of peppermint hung heavy in the air, battling the faint sweetness of burnt sugar that clung stubbornly to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's nostrils. She sighed, adjusting her bright blue scrub top and running a hand through her unruly auburn curls. The waiting room of Dr. Finchâ€™s dental practice was eerily quiet for a Friday afternoon. Normally, a gaggle of anxious patients would be shuffling in, their breaths held captive by the looming dread of flossing and scraping.  

Amelia preferred the calm before the storm. It gave her a moment to organize her trays, double-check instruments, and mentally prepare herself for the barrage of pearly whites (and occasionally, not-so-pearly ones) that were about to flood into her dental haven. She glanced at the clock: 2:45 p.m. Just fifteen minutes until the rush began.  

Little did Amelia know, this Friday afternoon would be anything but ordinary. A new patient, a stranger with eyes that held both curiosity and fear, was about to walk through those doors, disrupting the predictable rhythm of her day and ushering in a whirlwind of secrets, lies, and hidden truths.
