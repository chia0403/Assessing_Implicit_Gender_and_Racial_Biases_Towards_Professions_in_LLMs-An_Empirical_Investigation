The humid air hung heavy over Miami, thick with the scent of saltwater and jasmine. Penelope "Penny" Valencia, her forehead slick with sweat despite the shade offered by the palm trees lining Ocean Drive, squinted at the crumbling Art Deco building before her.  It was a relic from a bygone era, its once vibrant pastel hues faded to dusty pastels, its signature curves softened by time and neglect. It stood in stark contrast to the sleek, modern structures that now towered over the city, monuments to progress and ambition. Yet, Penny felt a pang of affection for this forgotten beauty. This was her project: The Casa del Sol, a once-grand hotel destined for demolition, but now poised to be resurrected under her hand. 


Penny ran a hand through her dark, curly hair, pushing back the stray strands that had escaped her messy bun. She took a deep breath, inhaling the salty air and the intoxicating scent of the ocean just beyond the bustling street. This was her canvas â€“ a chance to breathe new life into an old soul.
