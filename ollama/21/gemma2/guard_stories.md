The rhythmic clang of Elara Thorne's boots against the cobblestones was the only sound breaking the stillness of Dawnwatch Keep. The first light of dawn cast long shadows across the ramparts, painting the weathered stone in shades of grey and ochre.  A thin veil of mist clung to the valley below, obscuring the village nestled at its heart. Elara pulled her thick wool cloak tighter around her shoulders, the chill seeping through even the multiple layers she wore. Her breath puffed out in white plumes, a fleeting reminder of the harsh winter gripping the land.

She scanned the horizon, her keen eyes searching for any sign of movement beyond the keep's walls. Dawnwatch was isolated, perched precariously on a craggy outcrop overlooking the perilous Spinewood forest. It was a lonely posting, but Elara found solace in its solitude. 


Here, amidst the silent watchtowers and echoing corridors, she could lose herself in the rhythm of her duty, protecting the village below from the ever-present threat of the woods.
