The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Thistlewood like a second skin as she stepped out of her beat-up Honda Civic.  Palm trees swayed rhythmically in the gentle breeze, their fronds rustling like whispered secrets against the backdrop of cicadas buzzing incessantly. The scent of salt and sunscreen hung heavy in the air, a constant reminder that Amelia was perched on the edge of the Gulf Coast, where vacationers and retirees mingled in equal measure. 

Amelia straightened her blazer, feeling the familiar weight of her briefcase against her hip. As an insurance agent for "Coastal Care," she knew most people here viewed her with suspicion – a necessary evil to contend with when chasing sunshine and retirement dreams. She adjusted the collar of her blouse, hoping it wouldn't betray her nervousness. This wasn't just another routine meeting; this was Mrs. Agnes Periwinkle, a woman whose insurance claim had been inexplicably flagged as "suspicious." 


Amelia approached the quaint bungalow with its peeling pastel paint and overgrown hibiscus bushes, wondering what secrets lay hidden behind those floral curtains.  Mrs. Periwinkle had called in an urgent investigation request, claiming her beloved parrot, Captain Feathersword, had vanished under mysterious circumstances – a tale Amelia suspected was more fantastical than factual.
