The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Bellweather's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over her desk piled high with invoices. Outside, the Chicago wind howled like a banshee, rattling the glass windows of her small office in an old brick building downtown.  Elara sighed, pushing her wire-rimmed glasses up her nose and squinting at the tangle of numbers before her. It was always worse this time of year - the holiday rush had every company scrambling to balance their books before December ended, which meant Elara was drowning in a sea of receipts, expense reports, and frantic phone calls. 

She picked up a particularly messy invoice from a local bakery called "The Sugarplum Fairy."  Something about it seemed... off. The handwriting wasn't neat, like the other invoices, and the itemized list included bizarre things like "Unicorn Dust" and "Fairy Wing Powder." Elara frowned, her accountant instincts kicking in. This wasn't right. It was clearly a joke... or was it?
