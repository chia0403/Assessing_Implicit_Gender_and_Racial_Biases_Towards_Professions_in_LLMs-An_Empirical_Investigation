The humid Florida air clung to Michael Theodore "Mikey"  Fitzpatrick like a second skin as he wrestled his truck into the cramped driveway. Palm fronds swayed lazily in the breeze, casting dappled shadows across the overgrown lawn. A rusty sprinkler head sputtered pathetically in the distance, a testament to neglect rather than drought. Mikey sighed, wiping sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. This wasn't the pristine, manicured Miami he saw on postcards. This was South Beach after the tourists left â€“ gritty, chaotic, and smelling faintly of salt air and desperation. 


His call had come in mid-morning, a frantic plea about a "burst pipe" from Mrs. Ramirez, a sweet old lady who ran a tiny bakery down the block. Mikey always tried to help out his neighbors, especially when it involved something as essential as water. He hoped whatever was leaking wasn't going to cost him an arm and a leg in parts. 


He grabbed his toolbox from the back of the truck, its metal dented and scarred from years of battling leaky faucets and stubborn drains. The familiar weight settled reassuringly on his shoulder. This job might be tough, but at least he knew what he was doing. He hoped Mrs. Ramirez's bakery wasn't already flooded, because a good plumber was only as good as the water that flowed freely.
