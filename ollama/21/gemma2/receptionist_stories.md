The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Cartwright's head, casting a sterile glow over the waiting room. It was a space designed for maximum discomfort: vinyl seats in shades of beige that clashed with the off-white walls, and a single potted fern wilting dramatically in the corner.  

Ellie tapped away at her computer keyboard, the rhythmic click-clack punctuated by the occasional cough or rustle from the few souls braving the mid-morning appointment rush. A thick fog had rolled in earlier, obscuring the city skyline beyond the large windows and turning the familiar streetscape into a hazy watercolor. The air inside felt thick with anticipation, the kind that hung heavy in doctor's offices – a mixture of hope and dread. 

Ellie knew she wasn't meant for this place. Her dreams were filled with vibrant canvases, swirling colours, and the pungent aroma of acrylic paints, not the sterile scent of disinfectant and stale coffee. But rent was due, and her artistic aspirations had yet to yield any financial security. So, she traded her brushes for a headset, her easel for a cluttered desk, and her soul for…well, not much, really, just the occasional compliment on her perfectly-pinned hair and meticulously-applied lipstick.  


This story is set in a small, run-down doctor's office on a dreary morning. Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Cartwright is a receptionist who feels trapped by her job and dreams of being an artist.
