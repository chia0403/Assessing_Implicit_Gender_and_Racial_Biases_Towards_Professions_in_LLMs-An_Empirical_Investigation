The stale scent of cheap cologne and overripe bananas hung heavy in the air of the Grandview Hotel's lobby. A swarm of tourists buzzed around the ornate concierge desk, their voices competing with the rhythmic clink of polished silverware from the adjacent restaurant. Amidst this chaotic symphony, Theodore Jasper Bellweather, bell hop extraordinaire (as his mother fondly called him), stood silently observing.

His uniform, a crisp black jacket and trousers that had seen better days, hid the slight tremor in his hands. He was waiting for Mrs. Hawthorne, his most important client of the week. Not because she was wealthy or demanding, but because her husband, the renowned author Edgar Hawthorne, had recently penned a novel based on Theodoreâ€™s own life story. Now, with the book about to launch, Mrs. Hawthorne needed help navigating the whirlwind that was the literary world.  

Theodore's stomach churned with nerves. This wasn't just another luggage delivery; this was his past colliding with his present, and he wasn't sure how to handle it. 


The Grandview Hotel, a relic of bygone elegance, loomed over the bustling city like a faded dream. Built in the roaring twenties, its grandeur had long since been eclipsed by the grit of urban life, but within its walls, remnants of past opulence whispered tales of champagne wishes and caviar dreams.
