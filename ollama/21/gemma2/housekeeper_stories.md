The musty scent of forgotten linen clung to Eleanor Thistlewick's nostrils as she pushed open the heavy oak door to the attic room. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through a grimy window, illuminating a landscape of forgotten treasures and discarded dreams. Eleanor ran a gloved hand over a chipped porcelain doll, its once vibrant blue eyes now dulled with time, then glanced at the towering stacks of yellowed books, their leather spines cracked and faded. 

This sprawling Victorian mansion, perched precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, was her domain. For twenty years, Eleanor Thistlewick had kept the grand halls immaculate, polished the countless silver pieces to a blinding gleam, and tended to the whims of its eccentric inhabitants: the aging Lord Blackwood and his reclusive daughter, Iris. But lately, the air within these walls felt heavier, charged with an unspoken tension that Eleanor couldn't quite decipher.
