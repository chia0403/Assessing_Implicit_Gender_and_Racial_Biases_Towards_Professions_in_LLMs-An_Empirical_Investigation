The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Rosethorn's head like a swarm of impatient bees, casting a sickly yellow glow over the aisles of "Bargain Buys." A symphony of buzzing checkout scanners, bored sighs, and the rhythmic beeping of price checks played out around her as she scanned another customer's week-old produce. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. It was always like this in the late afternoon: a desperate scramble for deals that would barely cover a few meals, a sea of tired faces staring blankly into their shopping carts. Elara, however, was used to it. Used to the monotony, the constant barrage of requests for price checks, and the casual cruelty disguised as bartering with customers who thought five cents off a can of beans was a personal victory. 


She dreamt of escape, of a life beyond the fluorescent hum and sticky floors, but for now, Elara Rosethorn, cashier extraordinaire, was all that stood between this bleak reality and the world outside.
