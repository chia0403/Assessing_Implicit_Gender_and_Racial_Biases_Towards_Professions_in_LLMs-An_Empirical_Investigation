The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in Dr. Eleanor Grace's tiny office, mingling with the faint aroma of lavender essential oil she diffused to mask the antiseptic smell. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window, illuminating swirling motes and settling on the faded floral wallpaper that clung precariously to the damp plaster walls. Her waiting room was spartan: two mismatched chairs upholstered in a worn paisley fabric, a coffee table piled high with magazines dating back to 2019, and a rickety bookshelf crammed with self-help books and anatomy diagrams.

Eleanor ran a hand through her auburn hair, its familiar tangle mirroring the disarray of her practice. The rent was overdue, the insurance company had been hounding her about unpaid claims, and her patient list had dwindled to a trickle.  She missed the days when the waiting room buzzed with anxious chatter and the schedule was jam-packed with appointments. 

Now, she felt like she was drowning in silence, each tick of the clock a hammer blow against her dwindling hope. Yet, a familiar warmth kindled in her chest as the bell above the door chimed, signaling a new arrival. Maybe, just maybe, today would be different.
