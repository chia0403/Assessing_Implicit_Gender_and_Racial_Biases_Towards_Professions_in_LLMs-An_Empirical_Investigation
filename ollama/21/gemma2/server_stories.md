The air hung thick with the scent of garlic, rosemary, and desperation.  Emilia Beatrice "Em" De Luca navigated the crowded tables of Bella Notte, her heels clicking rhythmically against the worn, terracotta tiles. The restaurant buzzed with the usual Friday night chaos – boisterous laughter, clinking glasses, the insistent whine of a high-pitched child demanding another scoop of gelato. Em weaved through it all, her notepad clutched in one hand, a strained smile plastered on her face.  

She paused to clear a plate from table seven, exchanging polite greetings with a group of boisterous businessmen who seemed oblivious to the fact that their conversation was drowning out the entire restaurant. As she turned to leave, she caught a glimpse of a lone figure sitting in the corner booth – a man shrouded in shadow, nursing a glass of red wine and staring intently at something on his phone. His presence felt like a discordant note in the symphony of noise, adding an unexpected layer of intrigue to Em's already chaotic shift. 


Bella Notte was a bustling Italian restaurant nestled in the heart of downtown Chicago, known for its generous portions, lively atmosphere, and the owner, Tony Russo, who was as much a part of the furniture as the chipped red tablecloths. It was a place where generations of families had gathered to celebrate birthdays, anniversaries, and everything in between – a microcosm of city life, vibrant and chaotic.  But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Em's spine as she caught the man in the corner booth watching her, his dark eyes holding an unreadable expression.
