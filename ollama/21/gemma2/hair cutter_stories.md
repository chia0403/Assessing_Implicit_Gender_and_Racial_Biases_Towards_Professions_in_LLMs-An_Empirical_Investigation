The bell above the door tinkled merrily as Elias Bartholomew Thistlewick adjusted his spectacles and peered over the counter. Another Thursday afternoon in Little Haven, another parade of hopefuls hoping for a miracle at "Thistlewick's Transformations."  Elias surveyed his clientele: Mrs. Higgins with her perpetually-out-of-control curls, Mr. Peabody desperately clinging to the last vestiges of youth, and young Timmy Jackson, nervously chewing on his thumbnail as he awaited his first official haircut.

Little Haven was a quaint seaside town where time seemed to move at a slower pace. The air hung heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed, and the rhythmic crashing of waves provided a constant soundtrack to life. Thistlewick's Transformations, housed in a rambling Victorian building with peeling paint and ivy creeping up the walls, was tucked away on a cobblestone street lined with pastel-colored houses. 


It wasn’t a fancy salon, but it had character – just like Elias himself.  His shop was a tapestry woven from years of stories whispered between snips of scissors, tales shared over steaming cups of tea, and the quiet hum of transformation that filled every corner.
