The air hung heavy with the scent of salt and seaweed as Amelia Rose Blackwood squinted at the horizon. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky in hues of bruised lavender and fiery orange, reflecting off the choppy surface of the Atlantic Ocean. The small fishing village of Port Haven nestled beneath her, a patchwork quilt of weathered houses huddled against the ever-present sea breeze.  

Amelia adjusted the strap of her well-worn leather camera bag, its weight familiar on her shoulder. She was here to capture the essence of this forgotten corner of the world, to freeze the fleeting moments of life in these rugged, windswept landscapes and the faces of those who called it home. But as she surveyed the scene before her, a nagging unease settled in her stomach. There was something about the stillness of the morning, the hushed silence that seemed too profound, that made Amelia feel like she was being watched.
