The midday sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" Finch's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes as he tightened another bolt on the skeletal frame of the new skyscraper. The air throbbed with the clang of metal and the distant whine of jackhammers, a symphony of urban construction that had become Bart's daily soundtrack.

He stood atop the tenth floor, a dizzying height above the bustling city below.  Across the street, the once-proud Beaux Arts facade of an old theatre stood faded and neglected, a monument to forgotten glamour swallowed by the relentless march of progress.  Bart squinted at it, remembering his grandfather's stories of grand operas and silent film premieres, whispers of a time before steel and glass swallowed the skyline whole. 

A gust of wind whipped around him, carrying the scent of exhaust fumes and hot asphalt. The distant roar of traffic seemed to echo the churning in Bart's stomach – a familiar mixture of fatigue, apprehension, and the faint thrum of discontent that had been growing louder with every passing day.  This new building, this symbol of ambition and prosperity, felt like a cold, impersonal monolith compared to the warmth and stories of his grandfather’s city. He was just another cog in the machine, raising more steel giants into the sky while the world beneath them crumbled and changed.  


He pulled his hardhat down tighter, trying to block out the thoughts swirling in his head. Time to get back to work.
