The bell above the door chimed its familiar jingle as Eleanor Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles and peered over her counter. Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Finch & Son Apothecary," blurring the quaint, cobbled street beyond into an impressionist painting of greys and yellows. The air inside was thick with the scent of dried herbs and peppermint oil, a comforting familiarity in a storm-battered world. 

Eleanor sighed, her gaze drifting to the overflowing shelves crammed with dusty bottles and jars. It had been a quiet morning, save for the occasional cough syrup request from weary travelers seeking refuge from the downpour. She missed the bustling days of yore when Finch & Son was a hub of activity, the centrepiece of their small seaside town. Now, the apothecary existed in a melancholic limbo, teetering between tradition and modernity.

A sudden gust of wind rattled the windowpanes, causing Eleanor to flinch. As quickly as it started, the wind subsided, leaving behind an eerie silence punctuated only by the steady drumming of rain. It was then that she heard it - a faint tapping at the back door.  Eleanor's heart skipped a beat. Visitors were rare these days, and this one certainly wasn't expected.
