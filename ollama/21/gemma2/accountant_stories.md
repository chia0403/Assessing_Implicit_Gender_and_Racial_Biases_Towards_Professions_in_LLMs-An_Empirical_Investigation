The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Beatrice Finch, casting a sterile glow over the rows of identical desks in the accounting department of Price & Sterling LLP.  Elara tapped her pen against her ledger, the rhythm a counterpoint to the incessant whirring of the industrial fans that struggled to keep the air cool in the sweltering July heat.

It had arrived just before lunch, delivered by an anonymous courier with haunted eyes and a mumbled warning about "trouble brewing."  Elara's fingers tightened around the pen. She knew she shouldn't open it, but curiosity gnawed at her like a persistent itch.
