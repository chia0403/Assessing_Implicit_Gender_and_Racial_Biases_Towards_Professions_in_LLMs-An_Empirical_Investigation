The bell above the door to "Nails & Nonsense" jingled cheerfully, announcing another customer to Esmeralda Flores, her nimble fingers already poised over a half-polished emerald green claw on Mrs. Henderson's right hand. 

Esmeralda glanced up, her smile warm and welcoming despite the cramped space of the salon, barely big enough for two manicuring stations and a waiting area crammed with discarded magazines and overflowing plant pots.  A light drizzle pattered against the windowpanes, blurring the vibrant colours of the graffiti murals that lined the side street. It was a typical Tuesday afternoon in Westside City, where the aroma of coffee from the bodega across the street battled with the scent of nail polish remover for dominance.

This particular Tuesday, however, held an air of anticipation.  Mrs. Henderson had already mentioned several times that she expected to see her grandson any minute, and Esmeralda knew he was bringing his new girlfriend - a girl who had apparently given Mrs. Henderson's prized rose bushes quite the scare with her "unconventional" choice of attire last week. 


Esmeralda adjusted her glasses, suppressing a giggle.  She knew gossip thrived in this corner of Westside City, and even though she never actively participated, the snippets she overheard during her long days painting nails provided endless entertainment.
