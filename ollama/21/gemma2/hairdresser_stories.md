The bell above the door jingled merrily, announcing Penelope Beauregard’s latest client. Penelope sighed, smoothing down the already perfectly coiffed blonde bob crowning her own head in the shop’s mirrored reflection. Another Saturday afternoon spent weaving magic with shears and styling tools.  “Welcome to Hairitage!” she chirped, plastering a smile on her face. 

Hairitage was tucked away on a quiet side street in Savannah, Georgia. Its faded pink facade was adorned with a hand-painted sign featuring a whimsical caricature of a woman with cascading curls, and the scent of lavender and citrus always hung heavy in the air. Inside, sunlight streamed through dusty stained glass windows, illuminating shelves stacked with rainbow-hued hair dyes and vintage styling tools. The worn wooden floorboards creaked underfoot, and every surface held the memories of countless haircuts, color transformations, and whispered secrets shared between Penelope and her clients over the years. 

But today, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced on Penelope’s skin.  The woman who entered wasn't just another customer; she carried an aura of mystery, her crimson dress a splash of vibrant colour in the muted tones of the shop. Her face, hidden behind a wide-brimmed hat, seemed to hold a story Penelope yearned to uncover.
