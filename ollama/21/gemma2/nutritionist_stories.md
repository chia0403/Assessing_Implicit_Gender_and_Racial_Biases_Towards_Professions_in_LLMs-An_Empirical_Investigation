The morning sun, still shy about revealing itself fully, cast long shadows across the dew-kissed grass as Amelia Beatrice Thorne pulled her car into the parking lot. Her office, nestled in a charming yellow Victorian house on Maple Street, hummed with the quiet energy of anticipation. 

Amelia, affectionately known by her clients as "Amy," was a beacon of wellness in their small town of Oakhaven.  Her approach to nutrition wasn't about fad diets or restrictive eating plans, but about finding balance and nourishment within oneself. She believed that food could be both medicine and joy, a philosophy deeply rooted in the years she spent learning from her grandmother, a renowned herbalist who instilled in her a profound respect for nature's bounty. 

Today, however, something felt different. A restlessness fluttered beneath Amelia's usually calm demeanor. It wasnâ€™t just the unusually quiet morning; it was a lingering unease that whispered of change on the wind.  As she stepped out of her car, a single white feather drifted down from the branches of a towering oak tree, landing softly at her feet. 

Amelia picked up the feather, its delicate structure cradling the faintest hint of lavender. A shiver ran down her spine. It felt like a sign, an unwelcome portent of something unknown. But what?  


The answer, as Amelia was about to discover, would unravel a web of secrets hidden within Oakhaven's heart, entwining her own life with a mystery older than the town itself.
