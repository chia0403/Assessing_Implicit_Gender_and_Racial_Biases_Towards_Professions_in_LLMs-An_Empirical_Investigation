Rain hammered against the cracked asphalt, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser that quickly vanished into the swirling storm drain. Detective Amelia Rose Hawthorne hunched deeper into her trench coat, the collar pulled up against the biting wind that whipped through the narrow alley. Neon signs from the bar across the street cast lurid, flickering shadows on the grimy brick walls, painting grotesque images that danced with the falling rain. 

The stench of stale beer and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma to Hawthorne who had spent more than her fair share of nights patrolling this part of the city. The scene before her was particularly grim: a body sprawled amidst overflowing garbage bins, pale skin barely visible beneath a slick sheen of blood and grime. A crimson stain bloomed on the pavement around him, a stark contrast to the washed-out blues and greys of the storm-ravaged night. This wasn't just another drunkard passed out in an alley; something felt deeply wrong. 


Amelia Rose Hawthorne knew she was about to step into a darkness that promised few easy answers.
