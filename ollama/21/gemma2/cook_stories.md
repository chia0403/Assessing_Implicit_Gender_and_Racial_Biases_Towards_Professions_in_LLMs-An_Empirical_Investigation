The air hung thick with the scent of simmering garlic and caramelized onions, a familiar perfume in Elena Maria Rodriguez's world. The small, yellowed kitchen of her abuela's casa in Havana pulsed with life: sunlight streaming through dusty windows, the rhythmic clang of pots and pans, and Abuela Carmen’s boisterous laughter echoing off the lime-washed walls. 

Elena Maria, nicknamed "Mari" by everyone who loved her, moved with the practiced grace of a seasoned chef, her hands deftly chopping tomatoes while reciting a familiar Cuban proverb: “La mejor salsa nace de la paciencia.” (The best sauce comes from patience.) Her abuela's voice rose above the kitchen symphony, instructing Mari on the perfect way to knead dough for their famous pastelitos. Mari listened with half an ear, her mind already drifting beyond the warmth of their shared kitchen. Today was different; today, she was leaving Havana. 


The aroma of roasted coffee beans and fresh mangoes hung in the humid air outside, a bittersweet reminder of everything Mari was leaving behind.
