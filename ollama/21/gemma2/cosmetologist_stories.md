Lavender and chamomile essential oils drifted through the salon, attempting to soothe the frayed nerves of its patrons – especially Penelope Amelia Davies, whose manicured fingers were currently engaged in a battle with a tangled knot the size of a grapefruit on Mrs. Henderson's head.

This wasn't how she envisioned her life as a cosmetologist. It wasn't supposed to be this chaotic, this... ordinary. 


The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new customer. Penelope glanced up, hoping it would be someone looking for a simple trim, anything but another intricate braid or elaborate updo. But fate, it seemed, had other plans. The newcomer, a woman with eyes as bright and stormy as the approaching thunderstorm outside, stepped into the salon, her presence radiating an aura of both power and desperation.
