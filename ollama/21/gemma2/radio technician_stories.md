The rhythmic hum of electricity was a lullaby to Amelia “Amy” Rose Hawthorne.  She traced her finger across the dusty knobs of the vintage Zenith console, its wood finish worn smooth by decades of eager hands. Her workshop, nestled in the attic of her grandmother’s rambling Victorian home, smelled faintly of beeswax and solder. 

Sunlight streamed through the single dormer window, casting long shadows across the jumbled landscape of spare parts: coils of wire, a stack of mismatched capacitors, and a lone vintage microphone leaning against a pile of discarded circuit boards.  Outside, the sleepy town of Oakhaven was stirring. Birds chirped their morning greetings, and the distant rumble of delivery trucks signaled the start of another day. 

But in Amy's world, time stood still until she cracked open the shell of a malfunctioning radio, its secrets waiting to be revealed. Today, it was a battered World War II-era handheld receiver, its case scarred with battle-worn paint and missing parts. A customer had brought it in, claiming it held whispers from his late father –  a story that tugged at Amy's heartstrings. As she plugged the receiver into her workbench, anticipation thrummed through her veins. The static crackled to life, a symphony of electronic noise. Could this be more than just a broken machine?
