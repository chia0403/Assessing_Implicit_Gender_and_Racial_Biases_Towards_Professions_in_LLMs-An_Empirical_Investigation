The air hung thick with the scent of simmering tomatoes and garlic, a symphony of warmth that usually calmed Amelia Beatrice "Millie" Finch's nerves. But tonight, the familiar aromas did little to soothe the knot twisting in her stomach. Her restaurant, 'The Rustic Hearth', was packed for its Friday night opening, every table occupied by eager diners buzzing with conversation and anticipation. Millie, however, felt anything but energized. A week ago, she had poured her heart and soul into this dream - a rustic Italian bistro nestled in the cobblestone streets of Charleston's historic district -  only to face the devastating reality that her head chef, Marco, had suddenly quit, leaving Millie with a mountain of pre-orders and a sinking feeling of dread. 

Charleston was alive tonight. The humid air thrummed with the energy of summer, cicadas chirping a steady rhythm alongside the lively chatter spilling from every open doorway. Lanterns strung across the narrow street cast a warm glow on the weathered brick facades, transforming the ancient streets into a scene straight out of a storybook. But for Millie, this idyllic setting couldn't mask the frantic whirlwind swirling inside her kitchen.
