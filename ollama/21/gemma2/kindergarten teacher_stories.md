The bell above the door jingled its welcome song as little feet scrambled in, their tiny voices erupting into a chorus of greetings. Amelia Beatrice Lavender, affectionately known as Miss Lavender by her charges, surveyed the scene with a smile. Her classroom, christened "The Rainbow Room" thanks to its vibrant hues and playful decor, was alive with energy. A miniature cityscape built from blocks dominated one corner, while another housed a burgeoning art project: paper plate suns beaming with glitter glue smiles. 

Miss Lavender, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid and adorned with a single sunflower, adjusted the glasses perched precariously on her nose. Today was a special day:  Show and Tell. She took a deep breath, savoring the familiar scent of crayons, finger paints, and the lingering sweetness of homemade cookies from Mrs. Garcia's bakery across the street. 

The air buzzed with anticipation as each child, clutching their chosen treasures, lined up patiently by the brightly colored rug. Miss Lavender felt a warmth spread through her chest. This was where she belonged, amidst the chaos and wonder of kindergarten.
