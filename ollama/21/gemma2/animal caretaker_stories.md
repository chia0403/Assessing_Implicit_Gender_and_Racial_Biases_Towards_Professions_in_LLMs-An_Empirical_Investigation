The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and manure. Dew clung to Amelia Rose Hawthorne's overalls as she waded through the mud towards the barn, her worn leather boots squelching with each step.  

Sunrise painted the sky in hues of orange and pink, casting long shadows across the sprawling fields of Hawthorneâ€™s Haven, a sanctuary for rescued farm animals nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Amelia, affectionately known as "Rosie" by the residents, was already late, though it wasn't uncommon for her to start the day chasing down escaped chickens or soothing a distressed piglet. 

She paused at the barn entrance, inhaling the familiar mix of hay, oats, and animal musk. A chorus of bleats, clucks, and grunts greeted her as she pushed open the creaking door, stepping into a world of gentle chaos. Rosie ran a calloused hand over the rough wood of the stall where Buttercup, a retired dairy cow with soulful brown eyes, patiently awaited her morning feed. Her day was just beginning.
