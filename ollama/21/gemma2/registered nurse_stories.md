The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of jasmine from a wilted bouquet on Mrs. Henderson's bedside table.  Amelia Grace Hawthorne adjusted her stethoscope, the familiar weight grounding her amidst the chaos of Mercy General's emergency room. A cacophony of beeps, groans, and barked orders filled the space, each sound a testament to the ebb and flow of life within these fluorescent-lit walls. 

Outside the ER windows, twilight bled into night, casting long shadows across the bustling city below. But inside, time seemed to warp and stretch, moments elongated by the urgency of every pulse, every labored breath.  Amelia scanned her list of patients, a knot tightening in her stomach as she saw Mrs. Henderson's name - critical condition, respiratory distress. Another night on the frontlines.
