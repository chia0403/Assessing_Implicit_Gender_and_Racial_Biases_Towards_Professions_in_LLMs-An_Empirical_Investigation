The air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary in Bartholomew "Bart" Clementine's butcher shop. Dawn hadn't even breached the horizon yet, but the light from the gas lamps strung across the front cast long shadows over rows of hanging meat: slabs of beef marbled like ancient constellations, plump chickens suspended by their legs, and glistening sausages packed tightly in casings. Bart, a man built like an ox with hands calloused from years of wielding cleavers and knives, was already elbow-deep in his work, meticulously trimming fat from a side of pork. 

His shop, Clementine's Cuts, was nestled on a cobbled street in the heart of Aldergrove, a bustling port town known for its rough edges and even rougher residents. The salty tang of the sea mingled with the aroma of fresh bread from the bakery next door, creating a unique olfactory symphony that permeated the entire block. It was a world Bart knew intimately, a world where honesty was traded like coins and trust was earned through sweat and blood.  

But today, something felt different. The air hummed with an unsettling quiet, the usual banter of early morning shoppers absent. A chill snaked down Bart's spine, prickling his skin despite the warmth emanating from the coal-fired stove in the back. He glanced at the street, a premonition settling heavy in his gut â€“ something was amiss in Aldergrove.
