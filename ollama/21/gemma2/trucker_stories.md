The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Cletus "Ironhorse" McKinley's weathered neck as he squinted at the endless ribbon of asphalt stretching before him. The road shimmered in the heat, blurring the horizon into an indistinguishable haze of ochre and blue. His rig, affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," rumbled along, a steel leviathan hauling its precious cargo of frozen blueberries towards Los Angeles. 

Cletus had been on the road for three days straight, fuelled by lukewarm coffee, greasy diner food, and the rhythmic hum of Betsy's engine. He was a man of few words, his weathered face a roadmap of sunburns, laughter lines, and countless nights spent beneath a blanket of stars. The solitude was his solace, the open highway his sanctuary. But something about this trip felt different. A prickling unease settled in his gut, like a misplaced gear grinding against metal.  


He glanced at the worn picture tucked into the dashboard - his wife Mary smiling back at him with her familiar twinkle in her eye. He missed her laugh, the warmth of her hand in his, the comforting scent of her lavender soap. It was times like these, miles from home and adrift in a sea of asphalt, that he wished she was beside him. 


Suddenly, a crackle from the radio broke through the silence. A news bulletin, urgent and strained, spoke of a strange storm brewing off the coast, a tempest unlike any they'd seen before. Cletus shifted uneasily in his seat. He wasn't superstitious, but something about the announcer's voice sent chills down his spine. This journey, he knew, was about to take a turn for the worse.
