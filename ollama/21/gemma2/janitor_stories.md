The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and forgotten dreams in the Grand Central Library's silent stacks. Moonlight filtered through the arched windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stillness. Bartholomew "Barty" Quill, a man whose name was as unassuming as his job title, pushed his mop across the polished floorboards, its rhythmic swish the only sound breaking the quietude. He paused at a towering bookshelf, its spines whispering secrets from forgotten centuries, and glanced at the clock on the wall: 11:57 PM. Almost time for his shift to end. 

Barty sighed, his breath fogging in the cool air. It wasn't that he disliked his job - cleaning the library felt almost sacred, a way of tending to the whispers of history and the hopes held within its pages. But tonight, as always, a sliver of longing tugged at him.  A yearning for something more than the quiet solitude of his nights spent amongst books and forgotten dreams.
