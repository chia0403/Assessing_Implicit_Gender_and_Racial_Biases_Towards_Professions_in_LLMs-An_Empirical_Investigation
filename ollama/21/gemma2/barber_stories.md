The bell above the door chimed its melancholy tune as Elias Finch adjusted his spectacles and peered over his newspaper.  Another dreary Tuesday afternoon in Port Haven. Rain lashed against the dusty shop windows, blurring the already faded advertisements for "Finch's Fine Fades" and "Haircuts to Suit Your Style." 

Elias sighed, smoothing out the wrinkles in his starched white apron. It had been a slow morning. The usual regulars – old Mr. Henderson with his ever-growing handlebar moustache, Mrs. Peterson who insisted on a perm even though she swore it made her look like a poodle – hadn’t shown up yet. This usually meant Elias would spend the afternoon meticulously cleaning his tools, polishing the brass barber chairs, and daydreaming about the sea. He longed for the days when he could smell the salty air and feel the sun on his face instead of being trapped in this dimly lit shop, surrounded by hair clippings and the ghost of a thousand conversations.

Suddenly, the bell chimed again, interrupting Elias's reverie. A tall woman stepped inside, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat. Her coat was dripping rainwater onto the worn linoleum floor. He looked up, curious. He hadn’t seen her before in his five years running the shop.
