The stale scent of burnt popcorn hung heavy in the air, clinging to Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne like a forgotten costume prop.  Her office, perched precariously above the cavernous, dimly lit sound stage at Silver Creek Studios, was usually her sanctuary – a haven from the cacophony of filmmaking chaos. But tonight, it felt more like a pressure cooker. Amy stared out at the sprawling city below, its glittering skyline mirroring the anxieties churning in her gut. Tomorrow was picture day for "Nocturnal Whispers," her passion project, her shot at redemption after two consecutive flops. The weight of expectations, both hers and those of the studio execs who had poured millions into this gothic horror thriller, threatened to crush her.

Amy rubbed a hand over the worn leather of her director's chair. It creaked sympathetically, as if sharing in her unease.  The city lights blurred through the grime on the window pane, becoming a hazy constellation reflecting in Amy's tired eyes. 


Her phone buzzed with an incoming call – a number she didn’t recognize. With a sigh, she swiped to answer. "Hello?" 

A raspy voice responded, "Director Hawthorne? It's about your story..."
