The wind whipped across Jasper Ridge, biting at Elara Hayes' face like a hungry wolf.  Dust devils danced in the distance, their swirling forms mocking her efforts to herd the stubborn yearlings back towards the corral. The sky above was a bruised purple, promising a storm that could turn the already parched earth into a sea of mud. Elara adjusted the brim of her worn Stetson, squinting at the horizon where the last sliver of sun bled into the darkening plains. This wasn't how she imagined spending her 30th birthday. No celebratory steak dinner with whiskey, no dancing under the stars, just endless wrangling and the ever-present threat of a tempest. Still, Elara wouldn't trade this life for anything. The rhythm of the ranch, the smell of leather and horses, the solitude broken only by the occasional coyote howl - it was in her blood, inherited from generations of Hayes women who had tamed this land. 


**Setting:** Jasper Ridge Ranch, a sprawling cattle ranch nestled on the edge of the Great Plains. It's a rugged landscape of dusty plains, rolling hills, and harsh beauty, where life is dictated by the seasons and the ever-present threat of drought.
