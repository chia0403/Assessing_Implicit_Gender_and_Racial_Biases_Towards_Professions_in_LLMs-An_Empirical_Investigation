The humid Georgia air hung heavy as Elias "Eli" Thorne surveyed Mrs. Hemmings' prize-winning rose bushes, their velvety petals drooping under the relentless summer sun. He sighed, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with the back of his hand. This wasn't exactly how he envisioned spending his Saturday morning. 

Eli had dreamt of being a botanist, surrounded by lush foliage and fragrant blooms, not battling weeds and wilting flowers in the sweltering South. But life had a way of twisting dreams into unexpected landscapes.  His botanical aspirations were now relegated to the dusty pages of gardening books he devoured during his lunch breaks. 

The Hemmings estate was a sprawling Victorian mansion, its once-grand facade crumbling beneath layers of neglect. The manicured gardens, a testament to Mrs. Hemmings' meticulousness in her younger years, were now overgrown and unruly. A tangle of vines choked the ancient oak tree that stood sentinel at the front gate, its branches reaching out like skeletal fingers. This was Eli's reality: fighting for beauty amidst decay, one wilting rose at a time.
