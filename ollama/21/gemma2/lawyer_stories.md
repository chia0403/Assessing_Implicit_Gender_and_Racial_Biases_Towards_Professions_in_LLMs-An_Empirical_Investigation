The rain lashed against the windows of Eleanor Beatrice Finch's high-rise office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her. Below, the city lights were smeared into an impressionistic haze, but up here, in her sanctuary atop Manhattan, everything was sharp and defined: the clutter on her desk, the legal pad filled with furious scribbles, the tension knotting her jaw. 

Eleanor, a specialist in corporate litigation, had built her career on dissecting contracts and dismantling rivals, leaving a trail of defeated CEOs and trembling legal teams in her wake. But this case was different. This wasn't about millions of dollars or market share; it was personal. The man she was fighting, the CEO of a billion-dollar tech company, had stolen an idea from her younger brother, a struggling artist with nothing but his passion and a handful of digital sketches to his name.

The rain intensified, drumming a relentless rhythm against the glass. Eleanor looked out at the city, her face set in grim determination. She wouldn't let this man get away with it. Not when the stakes were so high, not when everything she believed in was on the line.


This case, Eleanor knew, would be her greatest fight yet.
