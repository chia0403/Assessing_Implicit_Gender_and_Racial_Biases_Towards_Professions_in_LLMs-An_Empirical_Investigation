The air in Ms. Agatha Penumbra’s office always smelled faintly of lavender and old paper. It was a scent Amelia Winthrop had come to associate with both calm and impending doom, like a well-worn velvet curtain hiding a theatrical disaster.  

Amelia, perched on the edge of her ergonomically-designed (and utterly uncomfortable) chair, chewed on the end of her pen, her gaze fixed on the swirling dust motes illuminated by the afternoon sun filtering through the dusty windowpane. It was Thursday, which meant Ms. Penumbra had a standing appointment with her “business associates” – a euphemism Amelia knew veiled shady dealings and whispered rumors that circulated like wildfire through the office grapevine. 

Today’s meeting, however, felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, as if an unspoken storm was brewing within the mahogany walls of Ms. Penumbra’s office.  Even the usually stoic portrait of a stern-faced woman (presumed to be Ms. Penumbra's mother) seemed to hold its breath. 


The rhythmic tick-tock of the antique grandfather clock in the corner echoed Amelia’s anxious heartbeat. It was almost time for the meeting to begin, and with it, likely another day closer to unraveling whatever secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of Ms. Penumbra's seemingly mundane life.
