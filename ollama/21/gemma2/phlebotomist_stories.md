The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, casting a sterile glow on the blood tubes lined up like expectant soldiers on the counter. A faint scent of disinfectant hung in the air, mingled with the metallic tang of fear – a familiar aroma to any seasoned phlebotomist working in Mercy Hospital's crowded outpatient clinic. 

Amelia, tall and slender with perpetually tired eyes that betrayed years spent navigating the tangled veins of anxious patients, felt the familiar tug of dread as the next name echoed through the waiting area: "Mrs. Evelyn Finch."  Evelyn was notorious – a legend amongst the phlebotomy staff for her ironclad grip, contorting limbs, and ability to turn a simple blood draw into a battlefield. Amelia sighed, bracing herself for another encounter with the woman who seemed determined to make taking blood an Olympic sport.


The small waiting area buzzed with nervous chatter and rustling magazines. Posters depicting healthy eating habits and smiling people jogging in sunshine plastered the walls, offering a stark contrast to the anxious energy that permeated the space.
