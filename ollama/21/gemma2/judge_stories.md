The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Judge Alistair Blackwood's mahogany desk, turning the intricate carvings into dancing silhouettes. Outside, the bustling city of Alderon hummed with life, but within the confines of his chambers, silence reigned. Alistair leaned back in his leather chair, steepling his fingers beneath his neatly trimmed beard. His gaze drifted towards the window, past the manicured lawns and fountain to the distant spires that pierced the twilight sky. He wasn't supposed to dwell on it, not with the case files piled high before him, demanding attention. But he couldn't help but feel a pang of regret as he thought about the life he could have had, a life beyond these austere walls and endless legal battles. 


Alistair was born for something more, for adventures whispered in hushed tones by traveling bards, for journeys across untamed landscapes, not this stifling routine of justice dispensed within four walls. But duty called, and he had answered, becoming one of Alderon's most respected judges, known for his unwavering impartiality and sharp intellect. 


He was about to delve into the complex legal intricacies of a particularly contentious land dispute when a knock on the door broke the silence.  

"Enter," Alistair said, his voice firm and clear, momentarily snapping him out of his reverie.
