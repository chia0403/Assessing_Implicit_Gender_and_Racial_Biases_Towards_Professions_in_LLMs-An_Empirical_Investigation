The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, a stark contrast to the vibrant sunflowers blooming outside the window of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's office. Sunlight streamed through the glass panes, dappling the worn wooden floor and illuminating dust motes dancing in the afternoon light. A faint melody from an unseen radio played softly in the background, a gentle counterpoint to the rhythmic click-clack of Amelia’s keyboard as she meticulously filled out patient notes.

Amelia sighed, pushing back her unruly auburn hair that always seemed to find its way into her face. Her day had been long – a string of frustrating sessions with patients struggling to regain their independence after strokes, car accidents, and neurological disorders. Each case felt like a puzzle, requiring patience, creativity, and a deep understanding of the human body and mind. 

Today, however, something felt different. A nervous flutter pulsed in her chest as she reviewed the file before her, the one belonging to a new patient arriving soon – a young man named Liam Carter. His case was shrouded in mystery, his reason for seeking treatment unclear beyond vague mentions of "loss of control" and "a change in how things feel." Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that Liam's story held more than met the eye.
