The red sun dipped below the horizon, casting long, skeletal shadows across the Martian plains.  A thin, rusty dust swirled in the ever-present wind, catching the dying light and shimmering like scattered rubies. Captain Elara Vance adjusted her flight helmet, the cool metal a stark contrast to the rising heat inside the cockpit of her modified Raptor lander. She checked the readouts one last time: atmospheric pressure stable, oxygen levels nominal, fuel reserves sufficient. 

Her landing site was a desolate stretch of ochre-colored rock just outside Olympus Mons, the largest volcano in the solar system. A silent, colossal monument to a long-dead world. Elara felt a familiar thrill course through her â€“ a mix of excitement and trepidation. This was it, her first solo mission beyond the relative safety of Ares Base. Her mission: to scout for potential water deposits within the extinct volcano's caldera, a crucial step in Terraforming Mars' long-term goal.  


Elara took a deep breath, the recycled air tasting faintly metallic, and whispered into the comm system, "Raptor One, requesting clearance for landing."
