The air hung thick with the scent of motor oil and burnt rubber, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of metal against metal. Sparks showered from beneath Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's wrench as she wrestled with a stubborn bolt on a rusted Ford pickup. Sunlight streamed through the grime-coated windows of her garage, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. 

Amy's workshop, tucked away on a forgotten side street in Riverton, wasn't much to look at. The faded blue paint peeled from the brick walls like sunburned skin, and a hand-painted sign proclaiming "Blackwood Auto Repair" creaked precariously above the rusted door. But within those dusty confines, Amy was queen. Her calloused hands held the secrets of engines, her mind a labyrinth of torque specs and compression ratios. She could coax life back into even the most battered of machines, whispering forgotten magic through grease-stained wrenches and welding torches.  

Today's challenge, however, had even her seasoned expertise tested. The pickup belonged to Old Man Hemmings, a fixture in Riverton known for his gruff exterior and stubborn loyalty to his beloved truck. A broken axle was just the latest ailment plaguing the old beast. 


The whirring of a delivery truck pulling up outside shattered the tense silence. Amy wiped the sweat from her brow, steeling herself for whatever new automotive crisis awaited. This was Riverton, after all â€“ where engines coughed and sputtered like tired souls, and every repair came with its own story.
