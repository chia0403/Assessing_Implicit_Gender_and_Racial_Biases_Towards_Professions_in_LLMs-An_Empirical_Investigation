Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the warped glass. Inside, Elias Thorne hunched over his ancient typewriter, its keys clacking a frantic rhythm against the steady drumbeat of the storm. The air hung thick with the scent of dust and old paper, a testament to years spent buried in forgotten tales and half-finished narratives. He was surrounded by stacks of manuscripts, their spines cracked and faded like the leather armchair he'd been perched on for hours.

Elias Thorne, once hailed as a literary prodigy, was now known mostly for his silence. The critical acclaim of his debut novel had faded with time, replaced by an oppressive weight of expectation that had strangled the very words in his mind. He'd retreated to this forgotten corner of his ancestral home, seeking solace in the ghosts of stories past and hoping to coax a new one from the shadows of his own heart.  


The setting is a dusty, neglected attic room in a sprawling, old Victorian house on the windswept coast of England.
