Rain hammered against the leaded windows of Professor Elara Blackwood's study, each drop a miniature explosion against the ancient glass. The fire in the hearth crackled merrily, casting flickering shadows across the stacks of dusty tomes lining the walls. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping through the gnarled branches of the ancient oaks that encircled Blackwood Manor.

Elara, her silver hair pulled back in a severe bun, hunched over a crumbling manuscript illuminated by a single oil lamp. Her brow furrowed in concentration as she deciphered the faded script, muttering incantations under her breath. The air crackled with an unseen energy, and the scent of lavender and ozone filled the room. 

Tonight was different. Tonight, Elara felt a pull towards this forgotten text unlike anything she'd experienced before. It spoke of a hidden power, dormant for centuries, waiting to be unleashed. A power that could change the world...for better or worse.
