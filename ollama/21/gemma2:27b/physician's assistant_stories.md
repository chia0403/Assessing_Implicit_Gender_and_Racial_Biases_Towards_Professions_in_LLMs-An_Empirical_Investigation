The humid air hung thick in Savannah, Georgia, clinging to Eloise Beaumont like a second skin as she hurried through Forsyth Park. Sunlight dappled through the ancient live oaks, illuminating swirling dust motes and casting elongated shadows on the moss-covered ground. Eloise, her crisp white PA uniform already damp with perspiration, grimaced. This was not the ideal weather for trekking across the park, especially after a grueling 12-hour shift at Memorial Health.

She was late. Not just fashionably late, but desperately, potentially career-endingly late. Dr. Eldridge, her demanding supervising physician, had specifically requested her presence at the annual Savannah Medical Association gala tonight. Eloise knew it was an opportunity she couldn't miss â€“ a chance to network, impress potential mentors, and maybe even land a coveted fellowship position.

But first, she had to navigate the labyrinthine paths of Forsyth Park, find the hidden fountain where Dr. Eldridge had insisted on meeting, and somehow manage to look presentable after sprinting across half the city in sweltering heat.  Eloise took a deep breath, her stethoscope bouncing against her hip.

This was it. Her moment. One wrong step and she could miss out on everything she'd been working towards.
