The rusted gate groaned like an arthritic giant as Elias Thorne wrestled it open. Dawn was just beginning to blush over the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, painting the dew-kissed grass with streaks of gold and rose. Elias, his weathered hands clutching a battered thermos filled with lukewarm coffee, surveyed his domain.  

Blackwood Manor wasn't your average estate. Its sprawling grounds, a tapestry of formal gardens, ancient woodlands, and hidden grottos, whispered tales of forgotten grandeur and lingering secrets. Elias knew every inch, every gnarled oak and vibrant rose bush, like the lines on his own face. He was more than just a groundskeeper; he was the silent guardian of Blackwood's history, tending to its beauty while guarding its mysteries.

Today, however, something felt different. A shiver ran down Elias' spine despite the warmth of the rising sun.  The air hummed with an unfamiliar energy, prickling his skin like static electricity. He chalked it up to nerves. The new owner, a reclusive millionaire named Alistair Blackwood, was arriving today, and rumors of his eccentricities preceded him.
