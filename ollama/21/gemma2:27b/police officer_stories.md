Rain lashed against the cracked asphalt, each drop exploding in a miniature geyser. Neon signs flickered erratically through the downpour, casting long, distorted shadows that danced across the grimy alleyway. Detective Elijah "Eli" Vance crouched behind an overflowing dumpster, his trench coat slick with water and smelling faintly of stale cigarettes. The stench of rotting garbage mingled with the acrid bite of exhaust fumes from the nearby highway, creating a nauseating cocktail that only intensified Eli's already frayed nerves.

Tonight was supposed to be a simple stakeout, a routine check on a known drug dealer operating out of this dilapidated building. But something felt off, a discordant note in the symphony of sirens and urban decay. The dealer was late, uncharacteristically so, and Eli couldn't shake the feeling that he was walking into a trap.
