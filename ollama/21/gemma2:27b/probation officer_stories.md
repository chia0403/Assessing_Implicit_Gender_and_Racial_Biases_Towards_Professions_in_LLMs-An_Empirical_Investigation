Rain hammered against Amelia Blackwood's windshield, blurring the already-dim streetlights into hazy orbs. The air hung heavy with the smell of wet asphalt and exhaust fumes. She pulled her battered Ford Focus to a stop in front of a dilapidated two-story house, its paint peeling like sunburnt skin. This was it: 347 Elm Street, home address of Michael Delaney, Amelia's newest probationer.  

Amelia sighed, running a hand through her already messy bun. A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. Delaney had been convicted of aggravated assault, a charge that always made her tread cautiously. He was young, barely twenty-two, but his file hinted at a volatile temper and a history of substance abuse. Amelia hoped tonight would be a routine check-in, but something about the oppressive silence emanating from the house felt unsettlingly wrong.
