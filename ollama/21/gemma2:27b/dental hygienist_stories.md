The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Penelope Hawthorne's head as she meticulously scraped plaque from Mrs. Gunderson's molars. The air smelled faintly of mint toothpaste and fear - a scent Eloise had come to associate with her job more than anything else. Outside, the Seattle drizzle drummed a steady rhythm against the window, mirroring the persistent tapping of Eloise's instruments. 

It was just another Tuesday at Smilebright Dental, a cheery name that belied the grim reality of most patients' dental hygiene. Eloise loved her work, truly she did. She enjoyed the meticulous detail, the satisfaction of transforming a grimy smile into something bright and healthy. But lately, a sense of unease had been gnawing at her. It wasn't just the usual dread of root canals and panicked toddlers; it was something deeper, a whisper in the back of her mind that refused to be silenced.

Perhaps it was the string of odd occurrences: Mrs. Gunderson's insistence on talking about cryptic dreams involving talking teeth, the unsettling disappearance of Mr. Henderson's dentures (found later inexplicably lodged in the office ficus), or the recurring nightmare Eloise herself had been plagued with - a vision of a grinning skull with teeth sharper than razors.


Whatever it was, Eloise knew she couldn't ignore it any longer. Something strange was brewing at Smilebright Dental, and she was determined to get to the bottom of it.
