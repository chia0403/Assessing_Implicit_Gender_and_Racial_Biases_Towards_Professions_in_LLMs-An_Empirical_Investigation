The dust hung heavy in the air, catching the morning sunbeams like motes of gold. Elias Thorne coughed, wiping a grimy hand across his brow, leaving a streak through the sweat and grime already caked there. His workshop, nestled into the hillside overlooking the bustling port town of Atheria, smelled perpetually of stone and sweat, the scent ingrained into every inch of wood and plaster. 

Elias picked up a chisel, its handle worn smooth from years of use. The sun glinted off the newly sharpened edge, promising clean cuts and perfect angles – crucial when carving delicate gargoyles for the cathedral’s spire. Today was an important day; the master mason himself was due to inspect Elias's progress. He had poured his heart into this commission, determined to prove he wasn't just a simple stone cutter but an artist capable of breathing life into cold granite.
