The incessant clatter of the train rattled Elara Vance's teeth as she stared out the grimy window at the endless expanse of industrial grey that was New Ironside. Smoke billowed from towering factories, staining the sky with an acrid orange hue. Even the rain, which lashed against the pane in a relentless torrent, seemed to carry the metallic tang of industry. Elara sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. This wasn't the glamorous legal life she'd envisioned back in law school, sipping cappuccinos in mahogany-paneled offices and arguing landmark cases. No, this was New Ironside, where justice was measured in cogs and gears, and lawyers were more likely to be defending factory workers against exploitative bosses than upholding constitutional rights. 


She adjusted the worn leather briefcase on her lap, its contents a stark reminder of the case that awaited her: a young woman facing wrongful termination after refusing to work overtime without pay. It wasn't exactly a high-profile case, but it was all Elara had been able to secure since arriving in this industrial wasteland. Still, she believed every voice deserved to be heard, even amidst the cacophony of New Ironside.
