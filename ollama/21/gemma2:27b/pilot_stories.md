The rusty hangar door groaned like an arthritic giant as Amelia "Ace" Blackwood wrestled it open. Dust motes danced in the sliver of morning sunlight that pierced through the gloom, illuminating the dusty hulk of her biplane, the "Phoenix." The aging Stearman was Ace's pride and joy, a relic from a bygone era when pilots flew by instinct and gut feeling, not by the sterile precision of computerized cockpits.

Ace ran a calloused hand over the Phoenix's weathered fabric skin, her heart thumping with anticipation. Today was the day. The annual "Wings Over Willow Creek" air show was about to begin, and Ace was determined to steal the show with her death-defying aerobatics. 


Willow Creek, nestled in a valley carved by the winding Willow River, was a sleepy town that woke up once a year for the airshow. Its quaint main street, lined with antique shops and cozy cafes, buzzed with excited chatter as planes of all shapes and sizes arrived, their engines spitting fire and roaring defiance against the clear blue sky.  Ace inhaled deeply, savoring the scent of engine oil and anticipation. This was her element. This was where she belonged.
