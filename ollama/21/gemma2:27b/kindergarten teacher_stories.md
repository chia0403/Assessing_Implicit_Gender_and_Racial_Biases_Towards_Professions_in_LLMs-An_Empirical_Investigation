The late afternoon sun slanted through the windows of Ms. Eloise Carmichael's kindergarten classroom, casting long shadows across the brightly colored alphabet rug. Crayons lay scattered like fallen autumn leaves, abandoned in mid-masterpiece. A faint scent of glue and peanut butter lingered in the air, a testament to the day's creative endeavors and snack time chaos.

Eloise leaned against her desk, exhaustion tugging at her eyelids. The cheerful posters on the walls seemed to mock her weariness. "Sharing is Caring," one proclaimed. "Kindness Counts," another declared.  She sighed. Today, sharing and kindness had been in short supply, replaced by a symphony of shrieks, tantrums, and tears. But tomorrow was a new day, and Eloise, despite the ache in her feet and the throbbing behind her eyes, wouldn't trade her job for anything.
