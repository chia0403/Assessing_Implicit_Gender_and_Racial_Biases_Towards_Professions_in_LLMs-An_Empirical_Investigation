Rain lashed against the bakery window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an abstract watercolour. Inside, Amelia Rose Winthrop kneaded fondant with a sigh, her floral-patterned apron dusted with powdered sugar. The air hung heavy with the scent of vanilla and cinnamon, a comforting counterpoint to the storm raging outside. Usually, the rhythmic thrum of the rain was soothing, but today it felt like a relentless drumbeat mirroring Amelia's anxiety. 

Her phone buzzed â€“ Mrs. Hawthorne, her most demanding client, calling about the six-tier wedding cake due for delivery tomorrow. Amelia braced herself. This wasn't just any cake; it was a towering confection of white chocolate ganache and sugared roses, meant to be the centrepiece of the most extravagant wedding Oakhaven had ever seen.  And she had just discovered a hairline crack in one of the sugar roses, threatening the entire masterpiece.
