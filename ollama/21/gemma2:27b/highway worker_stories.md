The Arizona sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Ramirez's weathered neck, his skin already turning a shade darker than its usual caramel hue. The endless stretch of asphalt shimmered in the heat, blurring the distant mesas into hazy phantoms. Eli adjusted the brim of his Stetson, squinting at the cracked pavement ahead. 

Today was pothole day. Not the glamorous work he'd dreamed of when he first signed up for highway maintenance - dreaming, back then, of operating heavy machinery and building bridges that touched the sky. Potholes were the bane of every driver's existence, but they were also Eli's bread and butter. They meant steady work, a paycheck to keep his old Chevy running, and enough left over to send a little something to his abuela back in Tucson. 

He grabbed his shovel, its worn wooden handle smooth from years of use, and sighed. Another day, another mile of asphalt warfare. The cicadas buzzed their incessant song, the only soundtrack to Eli's solitary toil. Yet, despite the monotony, there was a strange peace in it all - the rhythm of work, the vastness of the desert sky, the knowledge that he was, in his own small way, making the world a little smoother, a little safer for those who travelled through it.
