Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elmwood Pharmacy, blurring the neon "OPEN" sign into a throbbing smear of red. Inside, Beatrice Albright meticulously counted out twenty-seven lavender capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration. The scent of antiseptic and old paperbacks hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint, metallic tang of rain. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient tin roof above.

Beatrice sighed, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear. Elmwood was usually quiet this time of night, but tonight, the storm seemed to be keeping everyone indoors except for Mrs. Henderson, who needed her monthly refill of blood pressure medication. Beatrice knew Mrs. Henderson wouldn't dare miss her evening dose, and she was a stickler for routine. 

Beatrice glanced at the clock - 8:57 pm. Closing time was in three minutes. She hoped Mrs. Henderson wouldn't be late. The last thing she wanted was to be stuck here during the storm, alone with only the creaking of the old building and the rhythmic drip of a leaky pipe for company.
