The aroma of clove oil and decay hung heavy in the air, a scent Dr. Eleanor Vance had come to associate with both comfort and dread. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes of her inherited practice, illuminating motes of dust dancing above the worn leather chairs in the waiting room. Outside, the relentless summer heat shimmered off the asphalt of Main Street in Harmony Creek, a sleepy town nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering cornfields. 

Eleanor glanced at the clock on the wall - 10:32 AM. She was already running behind. Mrs. Higgins' root canal had taken longer than anticipated, thanks to her penchant for dramatic sighing and insistence on listening to "relaxing" nature sounds through her headphones. 

A nervous cough from the doorway startled Eleanor. A young boy, no older than ten, clutched a well-worn teddy bear and fidgeted with its button eye. His name was Tommy Miller, according to the hastily scribbled note his mother had left on the sign-in sheet. Today was his first ever dental appointment.
