The biting wind whipped across Silas Blackwood's face, carrying with it the stench of salt and decay. He tightened his grip on the worn haft of his spear, its bronze tip glinting dully in the pale moonlight that struggled to pierce the thick fog swirling around the crumbling ramparts. Below him, the churning waves crashed against the jagged cliffs, their ceaseless roar a constant reminder of the unforgiving sea that surrounded the island fortress of Aethelgard. Silas had been stationed here for five long years, his duty an endless vigil against threats real and imagined. He'd seen storms that could rip ships from their moorings, phantom lights dancing on the horizon, and whispers carried on the wind of forgotten horrors lurking in the depths below. Tonight, though, felt different. A prickling unease settled in Silas' gut, a feeling he couldn't shake despite years of enduring the island's oppressive isolation.  

Something was wrong.
