The rain hammered against the grimy windowpane like a thousand tiny fists, each blow echoing the anxiety gnawing at Theodore "Teddy" Albright's gut. He stared out at the neon-soaked streets of New Orleans, the vibrant colours of Bourbon Street smeared into streaks by the relentless downpour. His office, tucked away on a quieter street in the French Quarter, was as dreary as the weather outside. Dusty files overflowed from battered cabinets, and the air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and regret.

Teddy wasn't built for this life. He dreamt of being a writer, his head filled with fantastical tales and lyrical prose. But reality, like a cruel insurance adjuster, had denied him that dream. Now, he spent his days navigating the labyrinthine world of claims and policies, his imagination shackled by spreadsheets and actuarial tables.  

Today, however, promised to be different. A new client was due any minute - a woman named Evangeline Dubois, rumored to have a claim as peculiar as New Orleans itself. Teddy nervously straightened his tie, hoping this case would finally offer him the escape he craved, even if it was just for a few fleeting hours.
