The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he wrestled with a stubborn piece of rebar. Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes, but Eli ignored it.  He needed to get this section secured before the concrete truck arrived.

Around him, the skeletal frame of a new office building rose from the ground, a testament to human ambition and Eli's own calloused hands.

Today was different though. Today, a knot of anxiety sat tight in his gut, twisting with every clang and thud. It wasn't the usual fear of heights or the occasional miscalculation. This was something deeper, something that whispered of change and uncertainty.
