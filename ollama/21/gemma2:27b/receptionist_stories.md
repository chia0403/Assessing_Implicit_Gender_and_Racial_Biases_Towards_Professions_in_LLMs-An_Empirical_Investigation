Rain hammered against the glass doors of The Obsidian Tower, blurring the neon cityscape beyond into a shimmering, abstract painting. Inside, Amelia Cartwright adjusted her headset, wincing as the incessant ringing pierced through the melancholic symphony played by the building's piped-in music system – a baffling choice, considering the perpetually overcast weather in Lumina City.

The lobby buzzed with a quiet energy despite the late hour. Holographic advertisements flickered on towering screens, showcasing the latest cybernetic enhancements and designer bioluminescent plants. A sleek self-driving car glided silently through the revolving doors, its occupants obscured by tinted windows. Amelia sighed, tapping her manicured nails against the polished obsidian countertop. Another rainy Tuesday night in Lumina City – a city that never slept, but seemed perpetually shrouded in a melancholic twilight.
