The air in "Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow" buzzed with the familiar symphony of hairdryers, snipping shears, and gossiping clients. Estelle Dubois, her auburn curls piled atop her head in a messy bun, expertly maneuvered her client's chair while simultaneously weaving a story about her cat, Mr. Whiskers, who had developed an unfortunate habit of batting at her curling irons. Her salon, nestled on a cobblestone street in the heart of New Orleans' French Quarter, was a haven of vibrant color and intoxicating scents â€“ jasmine perfume mingled with the sweet aroma of hairspray and the earthy tang of styling products. 

Today, however, something felt off. A prickle of unease danced along Estelle's spine as she noticed a figure lingering in the doorway, shrouded in shadows. The woman was dressed head-to-toe in black, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat.  Estelle smiled brightly, hoping to dispel the growing sense of foreboding. "Welcome to Hair Today, Gone Tomorrow! How can I help you?"
