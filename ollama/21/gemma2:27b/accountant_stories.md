Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Archibald "Archie" Finch's office, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display against the yellowed glass. The rhythmic drumming mirrored the relentless ache throbbing behind Archie's left eye. Spreadsheets overflowed his desk, a chaotic battlefield of numbers and decimal points that only he could decipher. His calculator lay abandoned, its plastic keys slick with sweat from his tense grip.

The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. It was past midnight, the rest of the firm long gone, but Archie remained, chained to his desk by a mountain of overdue audits. He'd promised himself he wouldn't work late again, not after the last three nights blurred into one exhausted haze. Yet, here he was, wrestling with the Byzantine accounting practices of a dubious import-export company, their financials as murky as the storm raging outside.
