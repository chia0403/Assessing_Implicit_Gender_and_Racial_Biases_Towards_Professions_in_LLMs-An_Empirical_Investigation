The fluorescent lights of St. Judeâ€™s Rehabilitation Center hummed a monotonous tune as Amelia Rose Hawthorne adjusted the height of the parallel bars.  Sunlight streamed through the large windows overlooking a meticulously manicured garden, a sharp contrast to the sterile environment of the therapy room. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.

Six months ago, she'd envisioned herself working in a vibrant outpatient clinic, helping athletes regain their strength and agility. Instead, she found herself assigned to St. Jude's, specializing in traumatic brain injury rehabilitation - a far cry from the exhilarating world of competitive sports. Still, Amelia possessed an unwavering compassion that drew patients to her like moths to a flame.

Today, however, doubt gnawed at her. Her patient, Daniel, a young man who'd suffered a debilitating fall while rock climbing, seemed perpetually shrouded in a veil of confusion and frustration. Would she ever be able to break through the fog that clouded his mind and help him reclaim even a fraction of his former self?  As Daniel shuffled hesitantly towards the bars, his movements jerky and uncoordinated, Amelia braced herself for another challenging session.
