Stray hairs clung to the worn black vinyl of her chair like ghostly cobwebs, and the faint scent of bleach hung in the air, battling with the sweet, cloying aroma of her signature lavender shampoo.

Eloise sighed, running a hand through her own unruly auburn curls, reflecting the chaotic energy of the salon around her.
