The rooster's crow was lost in the symphony of cicadas buzzing amidst the tall cornstalks.  Elias Bartholomew shifted on his porch swing, the rough wood digging into his calloused hands.  He squinted at the sky, a bruised canvas of purple and orange bleeding into the rising sun. It promised another scorcher, adding to the string of days that had parched the land and withered the crops. Elias ran a weary hand over his stubbled jaw. He could feel the worry etching lines onto his face, lines as deep and unforgiving as the furrows in his fields.

This year, the rains hadn't come. 


The air hung heavy with the scent of dry earth and dust.  Beyond the porch, Elias' farm sprawled out like a thirsty beast, begging for relief. Rows of corn stood stunted and pale, their leaves curling at the edges. The once-lush pumpkin patch was reduced to a withered collection of skeletal vines. Even his prize-winning tomatoes, usually plump and red, hung listlessly on the vine, their skins cracked and dry.

Elias needed rain. Needed it bad. His livelihood depended on it.
