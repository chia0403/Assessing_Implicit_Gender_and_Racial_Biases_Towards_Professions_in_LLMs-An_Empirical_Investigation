Rain hammered against the frosted glass pane of Penelope Abernathy's window, blurring the already indistinct cityscape beyond. The late afternoon sun struggled to pierce through the grey veil, casting long, melancholic shadows across her cluttered desk. Stacks of manila folders threatened to topple over, each one containing a piece of someone elseâ€™s life, their hopes and dreams neatly typed onto crisp white paper. Penelope sighed, smoothing down a stray curl that had escaped her tight bun.

The rhythmic clatter of her vintage typewriter filled the otherwise silent office.  She was finishing up a letter of recommendation for Mr. Hemmings, a junior accountant with aspirations of becoming a pastry chef. The irony wasn't lost on Penelope - she too yearned for something sweeter than her monotonous existence as Mrs. Hawthorne's secretary.

Mrs. Hawthorne, a formidable woman with a voice like gravel and eyes that could pierce steel, was the CEO of Abernathy Industries, a sprawling conglomerate specializing in everything from textiles to pharmaceuticals. Penelope had been employed there for five years, diligently managing schedules, answering phones, and navigating the labyrinthine bureaucracy of corporate life. But lately, a restlessness had settled within her, a yearning for something more fulfilling than the predictable routine of her days.
