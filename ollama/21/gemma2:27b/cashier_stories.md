The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Hawthorne's head, casting an anemic glow over the overflowing grocery baskets lining her checkout lane.  It was 6:30 pm on a Tuesday, which meant the post-work rush had finally begun, transforming the usually placid aisles of Sunshine Market into a chaotic whirlpool of hurried shoppers and beeping scanners. Eloise sighed, already feeling the familiar ache in her lower back from leaning over the conveyor belt for hours.  

She glanced at the clock above the deli counter, willing it to move faster. Just two more hours until she could escape the fluorescent purgatory and retreat into the comforting solitude of her apartment, a paperback novel waiting patiently on her bedside table.  But first, she had to navigate the onslaught of impatient customers, each with their own unique brand of grocery-induced stress.
