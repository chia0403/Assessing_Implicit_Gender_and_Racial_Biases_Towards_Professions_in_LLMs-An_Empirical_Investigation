Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Harding's office, mimicking the tempest brewing inside her.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn armchair across from her desk, where ten-year-old Ethan sat hunched over, picking at a loose thread on his jeans.  Ethan was Amelia’s newest case – a quiet boy with haunted eyes who had begun exhibiting disturbing behaviors in school: withdrawal from friends, nightmares that left him screaming in the night, and an unsettling fixation on shadows.  

Amelia sighed, pushing aside her notes. The familiar weight of responsibility settled onto her shoulders. She knew Ethan's story wasn’t unique. Countless children carried unseen burdens – anxieties, traumas, fears that manifested in ways adults often misconstrued. Her job was to decipher the whispers behind those behaviors, to offer a safe harbor and help them navigate the stormy seas of childhood. Today, she felt ill-equipped for the task. The storm outside mirrored the one within her: doubts about her abilities, exhaustion from countless late nights poring over case files, and a gnawing sense that she was merely patching wounds instead of addressing the underlying causes.

But looking at Ethan’s trembling hands and downcast eyes, Amelia knew she couldn't afford to falter. She had to find a way through the storm, for him, and for herself.
