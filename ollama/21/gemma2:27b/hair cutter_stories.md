The scent of lavender and cedarwood hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint metallic tang of bleach. Outside, the midday sun beat down on the cracked asphalt of Sycamore Street, turning the world into a hazy mirage. Inside "Curl Up & Dye", however, it was cool and calm, the rhythmic snipping of scissors providing a soothing counterpoint to the low hum of the ceiling fan. Amelia Rose Butterfield, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, meticulously trimmed the split ends of Mrs. Henderson's silver bob.  

Amelia had inherited the salon from her grandmother, a woman whose hands could seemingly coax magic out of any head of hair. Now, it was Amelia's turn to wield that magic, transforming tangled messes into cascading curls and dull strands into vibrant masterpieces.  But lately, something felt off. The usual buzz of creativity was tinged with a restless energy, a yearning for something more than just another trim or dye job.
