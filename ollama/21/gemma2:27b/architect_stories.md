Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Thornhill's office, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic watercolor. The wind howled down the narrow alley, whistling a mournful tune through the rusted fire escape outside. Elias sat hunched over his drafting table, his brow furrowed in concentration as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn design element for a new public library. Blueprints and sketches littered the surface, a chaotic symphony of lines and curves that only he seemed to understand.

He was on the verge of a breakthrough when the insistent buzz of his phone startled him. Glancing at the screen, he saw it was an unknown number. Hesitantly, he answered. 


"Mr. Thornhill?" A gravelly voice rasped through the speaker. "I believe you're the man to see about a rather... unconventional project."

Elias straightened in his chair, curiosity piqued. He'd been craving a challenge, something to ignite his fading passion for architecture. Perhaps this was it.
