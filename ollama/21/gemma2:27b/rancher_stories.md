The wind whipped across the mesas, biting at Esmeralda "Esme" Reyes's face as she surveyed her herd. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling up red earth like phantom spirits. The sun beat down on the scrub brush and weathered wooden fences of her ranch, El Sol Dorado.  It was a tough life, but Esme wouldn't trade it for anything. This land, with its unforgiving beauty and stoic resilience, was in her blood.

She squinted, her brown eyes narrowed against the glare. Something wasn't right. The normally docile cattle were restless, their heads raised, nostrils flaring. A low rumble echoed from deep within the canyon, a sound that sent shivers down Esme's spine.  It wasn't the familiar bellow of a bull elk, nor the yipping of coyotes. This was something different, something primal and unsettling.
