The air shimmered with heat, distorting the view of the runway from Amelia "Amy" Cartwright's tiny galley window. Dubai International Airport buzzed beneath them, a chaotic symphony of ground crew signals, airplane engines groaning, and the disembodied announcements echoing through the cabin. Amy sighed, smoothing down her navy-blue uniform and tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. The humidity clung to her like a second skin, making her already tense shoulders ache even more. This was her third red-eye in as many days, and the glamorous life of a flight attendant felt decidedly less glamorous when you were perpetually running on fumes and smelling faintly of stale coffee.

Today's flight was a doozy: Dubai to London Heathrow, crammed full with weary tourists and restless business travellers. Amy braced herself for the onslaught of requests â€“ extra pillows, misplaced luggage, fussy children demanding juice boxes. But as she glanced at the worn passport clutched in her hand, a flicker of anticipation ignited within her. This wasn't just another flight; it was her ticket home. After years spent traversing the globe, she was finally returning to London, a city she hadn't seen since she left for flight school at eighteen. A mix of nerves and excitement churned in her stomach as she prepared herself for the long journey ahead.
