The greasy tang of motor oil hung thick in the air, clinging to Emilia "Em" Rossi's overalls like a second skin.  Sunlight, filtered through dusty shop windows, illuminated motes dancing over the cluttered workbench where Em hunched, her brow furrowed in concentration. She meticulously tightened a bolt on a vintage Mustang engine, its chrome gleaming dully under the fluorescent lights. The whir of power tools and the occasional clang of dropped wrenches provided a familiar soundtrack to the symphony of her workshop â€“ Rossi's Restorations, a haven for forgotten automobiles tucked away on a quiet side street in downtown Chicago.

Em loved the challenge of resurrecting these mechanical relics, coaxing them back to life from their slumber of rust and neglect. Today's project was particularly intriguing: a 1967 Shelby Cobra, its once vibrant red paint faded to a dusty rose, its engine silent but for the occasional cough and wheeze.
