The stench of iron and rosemary hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Thaddeus Bartholomew Buckleberry, proprietor of Buckleberry's Finest Meats. Dawn was just breaking, casting long shadows across the cobblestone street outside his shop, painting the rows of hanging sausages and cured hams in hues of lavender and rose. The rhythmic thump of Thaddeus cleaving through a side of beef echoed off the brick walls, a metronome marking the beginning of another day in the gritty heart of Butcher's Row.

Thaddeus paused, wiping a bead of sweat from his brow with a meat-stained forearm. His reflection stared back from the polished steel counter: a burly man with a shock of ginger hair and eyes as blue as the frost that clung to the windowpanes on winter mornings. He was known throughout the city for his impeccable cuts and even more impeccable temper, a trait honed by years spent wrangling unruly carcasses and haggling with demanding housewives.

Today, however, something felt different. A shiver ran down Thaddeus' spine despite the warmth of the shop. It wasn't the chill of approaching winter; it was a prickle of unease, a foreboding he couldn't quite place. As he reached for his cleaver once more, the bell above the door tinkled, announcing the arrival of his first customer of the day.
