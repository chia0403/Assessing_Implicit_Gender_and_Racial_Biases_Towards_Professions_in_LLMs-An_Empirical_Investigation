The Grand Blackwood Hotel loomed like a gothic titan against the bruised twilight sky. Rain lashed the cobbled street outside, mirroring the relentless drumming in Theodore "Teddy" Ainsworth's chest. He gripped the worn leather handle of a steamer trunk, knuckles white, his gaze fixed on the revolving door that seemed to spin with mocking indifference.

Teddy wasn't meant for places like this. His world was cramped tenement rooms and greasy spoon diners, not polished marble floors and gilded chandeliers. But here he was, fresh off the boat from Liverpool, clutching a letter of recommendation from his late father and a desperate hope for a better life.  The Grand Blackwood needed bellhops, the letter read. It didn't mention that they also needed souls strong enough to withstand the whispers that clung to these opulent walls like cobwebs.
