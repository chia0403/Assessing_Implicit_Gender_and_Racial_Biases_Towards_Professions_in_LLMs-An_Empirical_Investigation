The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck as he wrestled a roll of asphalt shingles onto the sloping roof. Sweat stung his eyes, but he didn't dare wipe it away – not with these gloves, thick and unforgiving. The rhythm of hammering, the hiss of compressed air from the nail gun, and the occasional shout from his crewmate below formed a familiar symphony. Eli glanced down at the ramshackle Victorian house beneath him, its peeling paint and overgrown ivy whispering stories of neglect and forgotten grandeur. This was the third roof he'd tackled this week in the historic district of Harmony Creek, a town clinging to its charm amidst encroaching modernity. But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation at the back of his neck, a whisper of unease carried on the hot summer breeze. 


Eli chalked it up to exhaustion.  He'd been working double shifts to save up for his sister's college tuition, and his body was starting to feel the strain. Still, as he hoisted another shingle into place, a glint of something unusual caught his eye – a sliver of metal peeking out from beneath the eaves. Curiosity tugged at him. This roof, with its patchwork of repairs and questionable stability, held secrets older than Eli himself. He knew he should focus on the task at hand, but that glint beckoned like a siren's call.
