Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the neon glow of the city into an impressionistic smear.  Inside, Emilia Rossi gripped the steering wheel, knuckles bone white. Sirens wailed a mournful song as she weaved through traffic, each red light a taunting reminder of time ticking away.  A frantic voice crackled over the radio: "Possible cardiac arrest at 12th and Elm... young female patient, unconscious..." Emilia's heart pounded in her chest, echoing the rhythm of the emergency lights. She knew this city like the back of her hand, every shortcut and hidden alleyway. But tonight, even the familiar streets felt treacherous, slick with rain and danger.

Emilia, a seasoned EMT with ten years under her belt, wasn't easily fazed. She'd seen it all – accidents, overdoses, heart attacks – but something about this call sent a shiver down her spine. It was the urgency in the dispatcher's voice, the mention of a "young female patient," that made Emilia fear the worst.
