The fluorescent lights flickered in a rhythm that mirrored the throb in Elias Bartholomew's temples. He leaned heavily on his mop, its damp head trailing a forlorn smear across the scuffed linoleum floor of the Grand Meridian Hotel lobby. The air hung thick with the scent of stale champagne and regret â€“ a perfume Elias had come to know intimately over his twenty years as night janitor.

Tonight, however, the usual symphony of coughs from elderly guests and muffled arguments behind closed doors was replaced by an unsettling quiet. Even the relentless tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner seemed to hold its breath. 

Elias straightened up, a prickle of unease crawling across his skin. Something wasn't right. He glanced at the grand staircase leading to the upper floors, shrouded in shadow despite the faint glow emanating from the moon outside the arched windows. It felt... expectant. Like something was waiting for him up there.
