Rain lashed against the windows of the ramshackle clinic, mimicking the turmoil in Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's chest. The pungent scent of disinfectant couldn't quite mask the underlying odor of fear and desperation that permeated the waiting room.  Ellie sighed, smoothing down her already pristine scrubs as she glanced at the clock - 2:03 AM. This was the third emergency call of the night, each one more unsettling than the last.

The clinic, nestled on a windswept cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic Ocean, was Ellie's haven. She'd inherited it from her grandfather, a gruff but beloved veterinarian who instilled in her a deep love for animals and a fierce dedication to their well-being. But lately, even this sanctuary felt besieged.  

Tonight's case, a frantic phone call from a lighthouse keeper about his injured puffin, was the latest in a string of strange occurrences that had plagued the coastal community.

Ellie's gut twisted. Something wasn't right.
