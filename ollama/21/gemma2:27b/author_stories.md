Rain lashed against the attic window, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the dusty glass pane.  Eleanor Vance, her silver hair escaping its bun, hunched over a rickety wooden desk, illuminated only by the flickering light of a kerosene lamp. The scent of old paper and damp wood hung heavy in the air, blending with the sharp tang of Eleanor's bitter chamomile tea. 

Her latest manuscript lay before her, a jumble of crossed-out paragraphs and hastily scribbled notes. For weeks, she had been wrestling with the ending, unable to find the perfect resolution for her protagonist, a tormented poet haunted by a spectral muse. The rhythmic drumming of the rain mirrored Eleanor's own mounting frustration.

Outside, thunder boomed, shaking the old Victorian house to its core. It was nights like this that Eleanor felt most keenly the isolation of her chosen profession.  She longed for inspiration, for a spark to ignite her imagination and set her story ablaze. But tonight, all she felt was the cold grip of writer's block.
