The aroma of caramelized sugar and warm yeast hung heavy in the air, clinging to Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright's apron like a comforting shroud. Outside, dawn was just beginning to blush the sky over Lavender Creek, casting long shadows from the quaint Tudor-style houses lining Main Street. Eleanor, however, paid no mind to the burgeoning day. Her focus remained squarely on the mountain of dough before her, each knead and fold imbued with years of experience and a dash of magic passed down through generations. In her bakery, "The Golden Crumb," time flowed differently, measured not by clocks but by the rising of bread, the slow bloom of yeast, and the gentle clinking of trays as they were pulled from the oven. Today was no different. Eleanor hummed a forgotten tune as she shaped croissants, their golden crescents promising flaky layers and buttery delight. But even amidst the familiar rhythm of her work, a prickle of unease settled in her gut. It wasn't the usual pre-market jitters; this felt different, deeper, like a whisper of wind carrying an unspoken threat.
