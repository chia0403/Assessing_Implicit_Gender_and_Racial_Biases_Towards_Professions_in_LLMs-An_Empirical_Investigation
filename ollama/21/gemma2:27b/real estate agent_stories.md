The midday sun beat down on Elara Montgomery’s perfectly coiffed auburn hair as she stood on the cracked concrete stoop, surveying the ramshackle Victorian mansion with a critical eye. Salt-crusted ocean air mingled with the scent of decaying wood and mildew, painting an olfactory portrait of neglect. This house, once a grand dame overlooking the rugged Maine coast, was now begging for mercy.

Elara sighed, adjusting her designer sunglasses. It wasn't the most glamorous listing, but every sale counted in this sleepy seaside town where tourism ebbed and flowed with the tide. Still, she couldn’t help but feel a pang of sympathy for the crumbling relic. Its peeling paint and overgrown gardens whispered stories of forgotten grandeur, echoing the bittersweet longing Elara often felt for her own lost dreams.  

She fished out her phone, preparing to call her client – a distant relative desperate to unload the property. As she dialed, a sudden gust of wind rattled the ancient windows, sounding like a ghostly lament. The hairs on the back of Elara's neck prickled. She was alone, miles from the nearest town, and an unsettling stillness had descended upon the air. 

This house, Elara realized, held more secrets than she bargained for.
