Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins' workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of sound. The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and rusted metal, punctuated by the sharp tang of solder. Bart, grease smudged across his forehead and a wrench clutched firmly in his calloused hand, surveyed the mangled mess of pipes before him with a sigh.

It was a Tuesday, which meant double trouble â€“ Mrs. Peabody's perpetually overflowing toilet and Mr. Henderson's basement sink that gurgled like a disgruntled ogre. Bart loved plumbing, he truly did, but sometimes it felt like he was wrestling alligators instead of pipes. Today, the alligator had teeth made of rusty bolts and scales forged from years of mineral buildup.

The workshop, tucked away in a forgotten alley behind the bustling fish market, was Bart's sanctuary. It smelled faintly of brine and sawdust, a testament to his dual passion for plumbing and woodworking. Shelves groaned under the weight of ancient tools and gleaming copper fittings, while a battered workbench held pride of place, its surface scarred with countless battles against leaky faucets and broken boilers.
