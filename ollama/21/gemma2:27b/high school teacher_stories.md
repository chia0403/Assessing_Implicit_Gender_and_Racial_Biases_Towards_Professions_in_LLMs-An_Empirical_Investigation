The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in Mrs. Eloise Winthrop's AP Literature classroom, casting a sickly yellow glow over the worn wooden desks and stacks of graded essays. Outside, the relentless August sun beat down on Willow Creek High School, turning the asphalt playground into a shimmering mirage. Eloise sighed, rubbing her tired eyes. Summer break felt eons away, and the weight of her students' expectations pressed heavily upon her.

She glanced at the clock ticking ominously on the wall â€“ 2:47 pm. Only thirteen minutes until the bell rang, freeing her from another day of dissecting Shakespearean sonnets and wrangling hormonal teenagers. Eloise longed for a long bath, a glass of Pinot Noir, and the sweet oblivion of sleep.

But first, she had to survive these last thirteen minutes.
