Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, mirroring the storm brewing within her own soul. The cluttered space, usually a haven of warmth with its worn leather armchair and overflowing bookshelves, felt suffocating tonight.  Eleanor stared out at the cityscape, blurred by the deluge, each flickering streetlight a beacon in the oppressive darkness. Tonight was supposed to be different. Tonight was supposed to be a fresh start after months of agonizing self-doubt, but her first client since returning from leave was already two hours late.

The silence, punctuated only by the rhythmic drumming of rain and the insistent tick of the antique clock on the wall, felt deafening. Eleanor chewed on her lip, battling a surge of anxiety. Had she made a mistake coming back? Was she ready to face the weight of other people's pain again after carrying her own for so long? The question hung heavy in the air, unanswered.
