Rain lashed against the windows of Mercy Hospital, blurring the neon glow of the "Emergency" sign into an Impressionist swirl. Inside, the air hung thick with disinfectant and the quiet hum of machinery.  Eleanor Vance, her auburn braid escaping its elastic band, wrestled with a stubborn IV line.

Eleanor forced a smile, "Almost there, Mrs. O'Malley," she murmured, her voice calm despite the frantic thrumming in her own veins.

Outside, sirens wailed, their urgency echoing Eleanor's unease.  Tonight felt different. The storm wasnâ€™t just meteorological; it seemed to crackle with an unseen energy, threatening something more than just a power outage.
