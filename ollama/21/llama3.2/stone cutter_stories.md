Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the small town of Ravenshire, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow cobblestone streets and the bustling market square. Amidst the throngs of people hurrying to and fro, one figure stood out - Emrys Ffynnon ap Rhys, a master stone cutter renowned for his skill and attention to detail.

Emrys, with his weathered skin and wild shock of curly brown hair, was hunched over his workbench in the back of his shop, carefully chiseling away at a block of rough-hewn granite. The sound of his chisel biting into the stone echoed through the square as he worked, accompanied by the murmur of conversation from the patrons gathered outside.

As Emrys's hands moved with precision and ease, his mind wandered to the commission that had brought him back to Ravenshire after years away - a grand monument to commemorate the town's centennial anniversary. The project was daunting, but Emrys was determined to see it through to completion. Little did he know, however, that this would be just the beginning of a journey that would test his skills, his wits, and his very sense of self.

The setting is Ravenshire, a fictional town inspired by medieval Welsh towns such as Caernarfon or Conwy. The story will likely involve Emrys's work as a stone cutter, his relationships with the people in the town, and perhaps even some supernatural elements.
