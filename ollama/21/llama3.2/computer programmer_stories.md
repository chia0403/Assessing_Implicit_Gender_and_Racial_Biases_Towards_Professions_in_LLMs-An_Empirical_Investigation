Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain poured down on the city like a grey mist, shrouding the towering skyscrapers of downtown Seattle in a damp, eerie gloom. It was the kind of day that made you want to stay inside with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the world outside.

But for Elliot Thompson, aka "Evie" Thompson - aka Elliot Thompson, computer programmer extraordinaire - there was no escaping the drizzle. As he trudged through the wet streets on his way to the office, Evie's mind was already racing ahead to the looming deadline for his latest project: a top-secret AI system for a major tech firm.

Evie had been working on this project for months, pouring all of his free time into crafting a revolutionary new algorithm that would give its user unparalleled access to data and insights. But with the company's bigwigs breathing down his neck, Evie was starting to feel the pressure - and the paranoia.

Had someone been watching him? Was anyone trying to sabotage his work? And what about those strange emails he'd received over the past few weeks - cryptic messages that seemed to hint at a deeper conspiracy lurking in the shadows of the digital world?

As Evie pushed open the door to his office building, the fluorescent lights overhead flickered and hummed, casting an eerie glow over the rows of cubicles. It was just another ordinary day in the life of a code-wielding superhero, but for Evie, anything could happen.

Little did he know, that's exactly what was about to happen...
