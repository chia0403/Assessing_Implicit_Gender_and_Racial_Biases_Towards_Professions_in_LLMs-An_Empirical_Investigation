The soft hum of the office fluorescent lights above seemed to echo through the air, making her feel like she was drowning in a sea of numbers.

Emily's mind wandered to the upcoming holiday season, when the streets would be filled with people shopping for gifts and their families would be gathering together. She couldn't help but feel a pang of loneliness, knowing that this year's Christmas celebration wouldn't be as joyful as it had been in previous years.
