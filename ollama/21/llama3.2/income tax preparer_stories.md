Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a crisp autumn morning in October when Emilia Victoria Jenkins, a meticulous and detail-oriented income tax preparer, stepped out of her small office in the heart of downtown Springfield. The sun was just starting to peek through the tall oak trees lining Main Street, casting a warm golden glow over the bustling streets below.

Emilia's own small office, tucked away on a quiet corner of the street, was a cozy haven filled with dusty tax files, stacks of worn textbooks, and the faint scent of coffee wafting from the thermos on her desk. As she unlocked the door and stepped inside, the familiar creak of the wooden floorboards beneath her feet felt like a warm hug.

It was going to be a busy day ahead, as the annual tax season was just around the corner. Emilia's clients were starting to trickle in, seeking her expertise on navigating the ever-changing tax laws and claiming their rightful deductions. With her sharp mind and kind heart, she was determined to help them make sense of it all.

But little did Emilia know, this year would bring more than just ordinary tax returns. A mysterious letter had arrived at her office that morning, bearing an unfamiliar logo and a single phrase: "Your past is about to catch up with you."
