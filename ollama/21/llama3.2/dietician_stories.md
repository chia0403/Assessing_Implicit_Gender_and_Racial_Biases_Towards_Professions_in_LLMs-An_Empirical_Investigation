As the last wisps of sunlight faded from the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the bustling streets of New Orleans, Dr. Alexandra "Alex" Thompson made her way through the crowded French Market. The air was thick with the scent of fresh crawfish and sweet coffee, enticing the senses and drawing in shoppers like a magnet.

A renowned dietician at Tulane University Medical Center, Alex had spent years studying the unique nutritional needs of the city's diverse population. From beignets and gumbo to jambalaya and po' boys, she had sampled her way through the culinary landscape, refining her expertise on everything from Creole cuisine to vegan options.

Tonight, however, Alex was not here to indulge in the local flavors or sample new recipes for her next lecture. She had a mission – to gather information about a mysterious patient who had been referred to her by a colleague at the hospital. The patient, known only as "The Lady in White," was rumored to be suffering from an eating disorder that defied explanation.

With her clipboard clutched tightly in one hand and a steaming cup of coffee in the other, Alex navigated the crowded stalls, weaving past vendors selling everything from handmade jewelry to artisanal soaps. As she walked, the sounds of jazz music and lively chatter filled the air, but Alex's mind was focused on the task at hand – uncovering the secrets behind The Lady in White's bizarre case.
