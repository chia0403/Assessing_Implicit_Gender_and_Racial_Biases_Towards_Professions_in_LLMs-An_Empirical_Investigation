Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished glass as Assistant Probation Officer Emily J. Thompson stepped out of her office building, breathing in the crisp morning air. She had just finished reviewing the case files for the week ahead, and her mind was already racing with the challenges that lay before her.

Emily's eyes scanned the crowded streets, taking in the bustling activity of pedestrians hurrying to and fro. As a probation officer working for the Seattle City Council's Department of Corrections, she had seen her fair share of lives turned upside down by crime and incarceration. But there was something about this particular case that had Emily's antennae twitching with unease.

The phone call from her supervisor earlier that morning had been brief but ominous: a new prisoner was being transferred to the Seattle facility, a young woman named Alexis "Lexi" Thompson who bore an uncanny resemblance to Emily herself. The details were sketchy, but one thing was clear: Lexi's past was shrouded in darkness, and her future looked bleaker by the minute.

Emily felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed out at the gray, rainy cityscape. She knew that when someone like Lexi came knocking on their door, it didn't bode well for anyone involved. The streets of Seattle were about to get a whole lot more complicated.
