Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished glass as Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her small apartment and into the chilly morning air. A fresh cup of coffee clutched in one hand, she gazed up at the towering spire of the Space Needle, its usually cheerful beacon now shrouded in a misty veil.

As a investigative journalist for the Emerald City Times, Lexi had spent years honing her skills on the gritty streets of Seattle. She knew every alleyway, every dive bar, and every hidden corner where secrets were whispered in hushed tones. Her nose for news was as sharp as her wit, and she had earned a reputation for tackling the toughest stories with an unyielding ferocity.

On this particular morning, Lexi's instincts told her that something was off. A sense of unease had been building in her chest all night, like the slow rumble of thunder on a summer day. She couldn't quite put her finger on it â€“ but she knew that today would be different. Today, the city would reveal its secrets to her.

As she made her way down the stairs and into the lobby of her apartment building, Lexi felt a familiar thrill run through her veins. This was what she lived for: the rush of adrenaline that came with chasing down leads, uncovering hidden truths, and bringing justice to those who had been wronged.

Little did she know, today would be the day that everything changed forever.
