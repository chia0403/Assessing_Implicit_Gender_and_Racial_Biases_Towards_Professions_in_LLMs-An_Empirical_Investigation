Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven were always at their most unforgiving in the early morning hours. The neon signs of the city's bars and clubs reflected off the wet pavement like a mirage, casting an eerie glow over the deserted sidewalks. It was 5:45 AM on a Friday, and the only sound that broke the silence was the hum of the city's traffic, a constant reminder that even in the dead of night, New Haven never truly slept.

Inside the cramped offices of "Signal Solutions," a small radio technician shop nestled between a dive bar and a vintage clothing store, the lights were still on, casting an artificial warmth over the cluttered workspace. That was where our protagonist, Elliot Everett Wembly III, sat hunched over his workbench, surrounded by tangled wires, broken radios, and the faint scent of ozone.

Elliot, a 28-year-old radio technician with a passion for restoring vintage equipment and a penchant for getting into trouble, was already up to his elbows in circuit boards and transistors. He had spent the night working on a rare 1950s-era shortwave receiver that he hoped to sell at an upcoming collector's convention. As he carefully soldered a delicate connection between two components, his eyes caught sight of a peculiar package delivered to the shop earlier that morning - addressed to him, but with no return address or indication of who might have sent it.
