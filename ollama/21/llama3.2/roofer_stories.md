As the first light of dawn crept over the sleepy town of Willow Creek, 32-year-old Jack "Hawk" Hawkins adjusted his worn leather gloves, taking a moment to survey the rooftops before him. The crisp morning air was alive with the sweet scent of fresh-cut grass and the distant hum of generators from the local construction site. Hawk's eyes scanned the slate-gray sky, his gaze lingering on the lone figure perched high atop the Wilson's residence – a fellow roofer named Mike, who had called it quits for the day.

Hawk had been in the business since he was a teenager, learning the trade from his father, a veteran roofer himself. Over the years, Hawk's reputation as one of the most reliable and skilled roofers in town had earned him the nickname "Hawk" – a moniker that seemed to stick, much like the rusty old hammer he always kept by his side.

With a quiet confidence born from years of experience, Hawk set off towards the Wilson's residence, his worn boots making barely a sound on the dew-kissed grass. The soft morning light cast long shadows across the property, illuminating the patchwork of overgrown bushes and weathered fences that seemed to stretch on forever. As he approached the house, Hawk noticed something peculiar – a strange symbol etched into the corner of the roof, partially hidden by the eaves.

Curiosity piqued, Hawk reached for his toolbox, knowing that this was going to be an interesting day ahead.
