Here's a potential story opening:

Detective Emilia Alexandra Rodriguez stepped out of her cruiser and onto the rain-soaked streets of Seattle's Capitol Hill neighborhood, the dim glow of the streetlights casting an eerie shadow over the deserted sidewalks. It was 2:45 AM on a drizzly November night, the kind that made you want to stay inside with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the world outside. But for Emilia, there was no time for that.

As she pulled out her notebook and began to jot down the details of the 911 call, a faint cry echoed through the night air - a sound that sent shivers down Emilia's spine. The caller had reported hearing a child's muffled screams coming from the alleyway behind a dilapidated warehouse on 12th Avenue East.

Emilia's eyes scanned the building, her trained instincts telling her that something was off. She checked her radio for any backup units, but it was just her and one other officer responding to the call - Officer Juan "Javi" Sanchez, a rookie with only a few months of experience under his belt.

Together, they approached the warehouse cautiously, their flashlights casting a narrow beam of light into the darkness. The air was thick with the smell of decay and rot, and Emilia could feel her gut telling her that this wasn't going to be an easy situation.

"Javi, stay close," she whispered into the comms device on her wrist. "We don't know what we're walking into."
