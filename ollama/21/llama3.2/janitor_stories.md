Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights above flickered and hummed, casting an eerie glow over the deserted corridors of Ravenswood High School. The year was 1985, and the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and worn-out dreams. Amidst the dusty lockers and peeling paint, one figure moved with quiet purpose - Emilia "Mia" Thompson, a janitor with a heart as dry as the crumbling plaster.

At 25, Mia had spent the last five years sweeping up after the students who came and went with reckless abandon. She knew every nook and cranny of the old school, from the sticky corners of the cafeteria to the creaky floorboards in the abandoned classrooms. It was a life that few people noticed - or cared about - but Mia found solace in the routine, the quiet rhythms of her work. As she pushed her cart through the deserted hallways, the soft clinking of her broom on the tile floor was the only sound that broke the silence.

Little did Mia know, however, that this ordinary day would be about to take an extraordinary turn.
