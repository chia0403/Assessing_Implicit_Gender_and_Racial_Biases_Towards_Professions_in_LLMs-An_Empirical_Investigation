Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Title: The Isolation of Raven Blackwood

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson had been working as a Physician's Assistant (PA) in the rural town of Willow Creek for three years, but she still couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off about this place. Nestled deep in the heart of the Appalachian Mountains, Willow Creek was a tight-knit community where everyone knew each other's business, and outsiders were few and far between.

Lexi lived in a small cabin on the outskirts of town, surrounded by dense woods that seemed to stretch on forever. She spent her days tending to the medical needs of the local population, from treating minor injuries to delivering babies to first-time mothers. But as the seasons changed and winter began to creep in, Lexi started to notice a strange sense of unease in the air.

People would whisper to each other in huddles on the sidewalk, their eyes darting nervously towards the woods. The town's annual Harvest Festival had been cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances," and the usually bustling streets were now eerily quiet. It was as if the very fabric of Willow Creek was beginning to unravel, thread by thread.

As Lexi sipped her morning coffee on the porch of her cabin, she couldn't help but feel a sense of foreboding. Something was coming, and she wasn't sure what it was or when it would arrive. But one thing was certain: when it did, she would be ready to face whatever lay ahead.

Little did Lexi know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would take her deep into the heart of the mystery surrounding Willow Creek, and test everything she thought she knew about herself, her patients, and the true nature of their isolated community.
