Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of asphalt that stretched out before him like a black snake. Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, a seasoned highway worker with 20 years of experience under his belt, stood at the edge of the road, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee as he surveyed the scene before him. The early morning dew still clung to the grassy median, casting a misty veil over the deserted stretch of highway.

Hawk took a deep breath, feeling the familiar weight of his 40-pound toolbox slung over his shoulder.

As he gazed out at the deserted highway, his trained eye picked up on a small anomaly - a faint smudge of dark smoke rising from the northbound lane. Hawk's heart skipped a beat as he set down his coffee cup and made his way towards the source of the smoke, his mind racing with possibilities. What could be causing this strange fire in the middle of nowhere? And what did it have to do with him?

The sun was just starting to rise over the horizon, casting a golden glow over the highway as Hawk began to make his way towards the mysterious smoke. Little did he know, his day was about to take a drastic turn...
