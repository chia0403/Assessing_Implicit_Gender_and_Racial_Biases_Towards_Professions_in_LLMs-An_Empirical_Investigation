As the sun set over the bustling streets of Camden Market in North London, 28-year-old Ruby Rose Wellington stepped out of her small flat above the market's iconic Lock Tavern, taking a deep breath of the evening air. The smell of incense and patchouli wafted through the crowded alleys, mingling with the sound of laughter and music drifting from the stalls below.

Ruby, with her wild tangle of curly brown hair and bright green eyes, had spent the day transforming the looks of market-goers at her own hair salon, 'Wildflower Locks'. From bold, edgy styles to soft, romantic up-dos, Ruby took pride in making every client feel like a million bucks. As she made her way down the narrow staircase, her hands instinctively went to the silver necklace with a small crystal pendant that hung around her neck – a gift from her grandmother, who had taught her everything she knew about hair.

Tonight was no different, however, as Ruby was on her way to meet an old friend at the market's famous 'Electric Dreams' stall. The stall owner, a fellow artist and free spirit named Zara, had promised Ruby that she had something special to show her – something that would change everything.
