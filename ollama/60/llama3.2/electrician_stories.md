Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a sweltering summer evening in the small town of Ravenswood, nestled in the heart of rural New Mexico. The sun had long since set over the vast expanse of the Sandia Mountains, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty streets and adobe buildings. In a small, weathered office on Main Street, electrician and owner of "Spark & Shine Electric" - Emily Josephine Rodriguez - sat hunched over her workbench, surrounded by tangled wires, flickering fluorescent lights, and the faint scent of burnt insulation.

Emily, a 35-year-old native New Mexican with piercing green eyes and curly dark hair, had spent countless hours in this cramped space, coaxing life from the most recalcitrant electrical systems. Her fingers moved with a practiced ease as she worked to repair the malfunctioning wiring in the local diner's kitchen, the hum of her trusty multimeter providing a soothing background melody.

As she tightened a stubborn wire connector, Emily's mind wandered to the peculiar request that had brought her here tonight - a mysterious phone call from the enigmatic and reclusive billionaire, Henry Blackwood, who owned the abandoned mill on the outskirts of town. Blackwood's message had been cryptic: "The lights are coming back on, but it won't be at the cost you think."
