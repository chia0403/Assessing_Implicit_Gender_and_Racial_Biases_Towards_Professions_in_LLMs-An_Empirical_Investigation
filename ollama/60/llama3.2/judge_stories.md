Here's a potential story opening and setting for a mystery novel featuring a judge as the main character:

The sun had just set over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a golden glow over the quaint streets and homes that lined its main thoroughfare. In the heart of this sleepy community stood the imposing stone fa√ßade of the Ravenswood Courthouse, where Judge Adelaide "Addie" Wellesley presided over the county's judicial affairs.

As she stepped out of her office at the end of a long day in court, Addie couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The air was thick with tension, and the whispers among the townspeople seemed to be growing louder by the minute. It wasn't just another case of gossip and speculation - this time, it felt like there was something more sinister at play.

Addie took a deep breath, letting the scent of fresh-cut grass and blooming flowers fill her lungs as she walked out into the cool evening air. She made her way to the courthouse parking lot, where her old Honda Civic waited patiently, its engine purring softly in the fading light. As she climbed into the driver's seat, Addie couldn't help but wonder what the next day would bring - and whether it would be enough to shake off the growing sense of unease that had taken up residence in her chest.

Little did she know, the night was just getting started...
