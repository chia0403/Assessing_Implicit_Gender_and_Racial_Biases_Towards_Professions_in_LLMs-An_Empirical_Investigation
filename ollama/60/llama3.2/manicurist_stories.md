Here's a potential story opening and setting for a story featuring a manicurist as the main character:

Opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in the bustling city of Tokyo, and Akira Nakahara was huddled over her latest client's nail bed, carefully shaping each curved finger with precision. The soft glow of the salon lights illuminated her focused face, where a few stray strands of raven-black hair framed her pale complexion. As she worked, her mind wandered to the peculiar phone call she'd received earlier that day - an invitation from a wealthy socialite to attend an exclusive charity gala at a secluded mansion on the outskirts of the city.

Setting:

Akira's salon, "Sakura & Co.", was nestled in the heart of Tokyo's trendy Harajuku district. The storefront was a colorful oasis amidst the neon-lit skyscrapers and fast-paced streets, with a hand-painted sign featuring Akira's name in elegant kanji script. Inside, the air was thick with the sweet scent of nail polish and the hum of conversation from the salon's clientele - a diverse group of fashionistas, businesswomen, and locals seeking the latest beauty trends.

As Akira carefully applied a final coat of glossy red polish to her client's ring finger, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this mysterious invitation. Who was behind it? And what did they want from her? The questions swirled in her mind as she gazed out the salon window at the rain-soaked streets below, wondering what lay ahead for her own life - and nails.

Main character:

Akira Nakahara is a 28-year-old Japanese-Canadian manicurist with a passion for nail art and design. Born to Japanese parents in Vancouver, Canada, Akira moved back to Tokyo after completing beauty school in Seattle. With years of experience working in top salons across the city, she's built a loyal client base and a reputation for her creative nail designs and exceptional customer service. Despite her success, Akira feels suffocated by the pressures of running her own business and longs for something more - adventure, excitement, and perhaps even a little bit of danger.
