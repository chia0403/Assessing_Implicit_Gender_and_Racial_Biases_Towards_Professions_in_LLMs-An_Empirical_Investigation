Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The small town of Willow Creek, nestled in the heart of rural Ohio, was bathed in the warm golden light of autumn evening. The leaves on the trees had long since changed color, but the air still carried the sweet scent of ripe apples and wood smoke from the chimneys of the old houses.

In a cozy little house on Elm Street, elementary school teacher Emily Mayfield sat at her kitchen table, sipping a cup of coffee and staring out the window at the fading light. She rubbed her tired eyes, feeling the weight of another long day at Springdale Elementary School bearing down on her. It had been a tough morning, with a particularly rambunctious class of fourth-graders getting into mischief in the classroom.

As she gazed out the window, Emily's mind began to wander back to her own childhood, growing up just outside of Willow Creek and spending countless hours exploring the woods and fields behind her family's old farmhouse. She had always loved this place, with its rolling hills and winding streams, and it was no surprise that she had ended up teaching at Springdale Elementary after graduating from Ohio State University.

But as she sat there in the silence of her kitchen, Emily couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A sense of unease had been growing inside her for weeks, ever since a mysterious package had arrived at her school with no return address and no indication of who might have sent it. The contents of the package - a small, antique locket with a photograph of a woman Emily didn't recognize - had only added to her growing sense of unease.

And now, as she sat in her kitchen watching the sun set over Willow Creek, Emily felt a shiver run down her spine. What was going on in this quiet little town, and why did she seem to be right in the middle of it all?
