Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the Hudson River, shrouding the city in a damp, grey mist that clung to everything it touched. In a small, cluttered workshop nestled between towering skyscrapers in Lower Manhattan, Amelia "Addie" Thompson hunched over her drafting table, her eyes fixed intently on the screen of her computer as she worked to meet the looming deadline for her latest project.

As a skilled drafting worker at a large architecture firm, Addie was responsible for creating precise, detailed plans and drawings for some of the city's most ambitious new developments. She took pride in her work, pouring over every line, curve, and dimension to ensure that every building she designed was not only functional but also visually stunning.

Tonight, though, Addie's focus was on more than just meeting a deadline - it was on unraveling a mystery. A cryptic message had been sent to the firm's CEO earlier that day, hinting at a potential scandal involving one of their biggest clients. The email had been quickly dismissed as a prank, but Addie couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

As she worked, the sound of construction equipment and chatter from the other workshop drifted in through the open door, mingling with the hum of the computer and the occasional ring of the phone. It was just another typical evening in the bustling world of New York City's architecture industry - but for Addie, something more was on the horizon, waiting to be uncovered.
