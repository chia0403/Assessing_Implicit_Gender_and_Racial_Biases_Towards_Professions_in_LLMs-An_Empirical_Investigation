Here's a potential story opening and setting for a mystery novel:

Dr. Emilia "Mia" Thompson stood at the edge of her dental practice's sunroom, gazing out at the tranquil morning landscape. The early sunlight cast a warm glow over the bustling streets of Willow Creek, a picturesque town nestled in the heart of the Pacific Northwest. As she sipped her coffee and surveyed the peaceful scene, Mia felt a sense of calm wash over her – a rare commodity for someone as Type-A as herself.

As a specialist in periodontics, Mia had spent years honing her skills to provide the best care possible for her patients' gums and teeth. Her practice, Thompson Smiles, was a trusted fixture in the community, with a loyal patient base that appreciated her gentle touch and attention to detail. Despite the long hours and high-stress demands of running a business, Mia loved her job – there was something satisfying about transforming smileless faces into beaming grins.

As she turned back towards her office, a sudden jolt of unease ran through her veins. It started as a whisper in her mind, a nagging feeling that something was off. She tried to shake it off as mere paranoia, but the sensation lingered, refusing to be dismissed. Little did Mia know, this sense of unease would soon become the harbinger of a dark and twisted mystery that would test everything she thought she knew about her town – and herself.

How's that?
