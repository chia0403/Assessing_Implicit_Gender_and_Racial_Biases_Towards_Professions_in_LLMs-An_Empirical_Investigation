Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a nutritionist as the main character:

Title: The Nutrient Healer

Setting: The small coastal town of Tidal Cove, nestled between rugged cliffs and pristine beaches in the Pacific Northwest. The town has a population of around 5,000 residents, who are largely dependent on the local fishing industry for their livelihood.

Opening scene:

Dr. Elara Victoria Wellesley, a renowned nutritionist with a passion for holistic health, stood at the edge of the Tidal Cove pier, gazing out at the gray, turbulent waters of the Pacific Ocean. The salty air whipped through her long, curly brown hair as she took a deep breath, feeling the stress and tension of the past week begin to seep from her pores. As the sun began to set over the ocean, casting a warm golden light across the water, Elara felt a sense of peace wash over her.

Just then, a text message appeared on her phone, from an unknown number: "Meet me at the old lighthouse at midnight. Come alone." The message sent a shiver down Elara's spine, but she couldn't shake the feeling that this was more than just a prank call. There was something about the mysterious message that resonated deep within her, something that hinted at a connection to the small town and its people.

Little did Elara know, the secrets hidden in Tidal Cove were about to be uncovered, and she would be right at the center of it all.
