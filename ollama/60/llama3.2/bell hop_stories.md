Here's a potential story opening:

---

The rain pattered against the roof of the Grand Hotel like a chorus of restless spirits, casting a melancholy mood over the grand lobby. It was 2:47 AM on a drizzly Friday night in late October, and the only sound besides the raindrops was the soft creaking of old wooden chairs and the distant hum of a lone jazz melody drifting from the hotel's piano bar.

In this dimly lit world, where the champagne toasts had given way to solitary sips and hushed conversations, our bellhop, Everett Fletcher Wellington III, moved with quiet efficiency through the deserted hallways. His worn suit and tie, adorned with a silver name tag in bold letters, seemed almost incongruous against the faded opulence of the hotel's Victorian-era decor.

Everett had been working at the Grand for five years, ever since his father's retirement from the hotel industry. He took pride in knowing every inch of its labyrinthine corridors and hidden nooks, but tonight felt different. Tonight, he was on edge, his mind wandering to the cryptic message that had arrived earlier that evening, tucked into a worn leather envelope with his name scribbled in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at room 314. Come alone."
