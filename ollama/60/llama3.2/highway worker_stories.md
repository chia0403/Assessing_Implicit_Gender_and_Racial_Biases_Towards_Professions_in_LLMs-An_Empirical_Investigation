Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the vast expanse of Oklahoma's Route 66, casting a golden glow over the deserted stretch of asphalt. Highway worker, Emmet "Hawk" Hawkins, stood at the edge of the concrete, his boots scuffed and worn from days on end of grueling labor. The familiar smell of hot tar and diesel fuel hung heavy in the air as he surveyed the latest patch job, a hastily slapped-together repair that would surely be washed away by the next rainstorm.

Hawk had worked the road for over two decades, fixing potholes, repaving lanes, and maintaining the crumbling infrastructure that kept the country's arteries flowing. He knew every twist and turn of this stretch, every hidden ditch and hidden danger waiting to snare the unwary driver. And he took pride in his work, no matter how thankless it seemed.

As he gazed out into the early morning light, Hawk felt a sense of restlessness settle over him. It was more than just the usual weariness that came with a long night's sleep and a heavy workload – there was something else lurking beneath the surface, something that had been nagging at him for weeks now.

"Hey, Hawk," his foreman, Bill Owens, called out from behind a stack of road signs. "We got ourselves a real problem on our hands."

Hawk turned to face his boss, his eyes squinting against the bright morning light. He knew that tone – it was the one that always signaled trouble.

"What kind of trouble?" Hawk asked, his voice low and even.

Bill hesitated, then spat a wad of chew onto the ground. "Ain't no one been seen on that stretch for days. And what's left of the last crew... well, let's just say they won't be driving themselves to work anytime soon."

Hawk's gut tightened with unease as he gazed back out at the deserted road. Something didn't feel right. Not for the first time in his years working this stretch, a nagging feeling had taken up residence in the pit of his stomach – and it was growing by the minute.

This is just one possible starting point. Do you want me to elaborate or continue with the story?
