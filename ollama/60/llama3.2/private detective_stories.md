Here's a potential story opening and setting:

**Opening**

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle when Emilia "Evie" Rodriguez stepped out of her office and into the rain-soaked streets. The neon lights of Pike Place Market reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the crowded sidewalks. Evie pulled her trench coat tighter around her and lit a cigarette, feeling the familiar pang of nicotine withdrawal as she breathed in the smoke.

**Setting**

Seattle was a city of contradictions – mist-shrouded mountains gave way to glass-and-steel skyscrapers, while the sound of seagulls filled the air alongside the hum of traffic. As a private detective, Evie had seen it all – from high-stakes corporate espionage to low-rent con artist schemes. She had a reputation for being one of the best in the business, but that didn't mean she wasn't struggling. The rain-soaked streets seemed to seep into her bones, weighing her down like a damp shroud.

Evie's office was a small, cramped space above a dive bar on Capitol Hill. The walls were lined with dusty files and faded photographs, while the air was thick with the smell of stale coffee and last night's cheap wine. It was a far cry from the gleaming glass towers of downtown, but Evie liked it – it felt like home.

As she flicked her cigarette into the gutter, Evie's phone buzzed in her pocket. A text message from an unknown number read: "Meet me at the Red Lion tonight. Come alone." Evie raised an eyebrow, feeling a spark of curiosity ignite within her. Who was this mysterious client, and what did they want? Only time – and the rain-soaked streets of Seattle – would tell.
