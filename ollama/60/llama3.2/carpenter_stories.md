The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and homes. In a small workshop nestled between a vintage clothing store and a bustling diner, 35-year-old Emrys "Em" Wynter was bringing his latest woodworking project to life.

As he carefully sanded down the intricate patterns on the wooden chest, Em's thoughts turned to the upcoming town festival. He had spent weeks planning and preparing for the event, determined to win first prize with his entry, a stunning handmade rocking chair. The air was thick with the scent of sawdust and wood stain as Em added the final touches to his masterpiece.

A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside him all day, like a tiny crack in the wood that refused to be filled. He pushed the feeling aside, telling himself it was just nerves about the festival. Yet, as he stepped back to admire his handiwork, Em couldn't help but wonder what secrets the night might hold...
