Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Manhattan gleamed like polished steel as Jack Alexander Wellington III stepped out of his sleek black town car and onto the sidewalk of 52nd Street. A briefcase clutched tightly in one hand, he gazed up at the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever, their peaks lost in the grey mist that shrouded the city.

At 35, Jack was a rising star in the world of high finance, a stock broker with a reputation for making bold predictions and landing big deals. His firm, Wellington & Co., was one of the most respected names on Wall Street, and Jack's own success had earned him a corner office and a salary that made him one of the wealthiest young men in New York.

But as he stood there, a gust of wind whipping his dark hair into a frenzy, Jack couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside him all week, like a low-grade fever that refused to break. He tried to push it aside, telling himself he was just tired from a long night at the office, but deep down, he knew better.

As he pulled out his phone to hail another car, Jack's gaze drifted up to the glass facade of his building, where a message scrawled across the window in bold red letters made his heart skip a beat: "Meet me on the rooftop. -J".
