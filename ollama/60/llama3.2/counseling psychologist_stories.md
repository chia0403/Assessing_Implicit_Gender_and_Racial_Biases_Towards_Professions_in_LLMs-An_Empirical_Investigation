Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office building and onto the crisp autumn morning air, taking a deep breath to clear the residue of yet another draining session with a client. As a counseling psychologist specializing in trauma and anxiety, she'd seen her fair share of broken lives, but that didn't make it any easier. The leaves on the trees outside seemed to rustle in unison with the turmoil brewing within her own mind.

Lexi took another deep breath and began the short walk to the nearby park, where she planned to clear her head before heading back to her office for a busy day of appointments. The sun was just starting to rise over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the sleepy neighborhood. It was moments like these that Lexi cherished - brief respites from the emotional chaos that seemed to follow her everywhere.

As she walked, Lexi's mind wandered to the peculiar case she'd been working on lately: the enigmatic and charismatic businessman who'd been visiting her for sessions about his increasingly erratic behavior. There was something about him that didn't add up, a sense of detachment that made Lexi wonder if he was genuinely seeking help or hiding secrets behind his charming smile.

Lexi's thoughts were interrupted by the sound of children playing in the distance, their laughter carrying on the wind as they chased each other around the playground. She smiled wistfully, remembering the carefree days of her own childhood when life hadn't been so complicated, when her biggest worry was what game to play next.

As she approached the park entrance, Lexi's gaze landed on a small piece of paper stuck to the bench with a cryptic message scrawled in red ink: "They're watching you, Lexi."
