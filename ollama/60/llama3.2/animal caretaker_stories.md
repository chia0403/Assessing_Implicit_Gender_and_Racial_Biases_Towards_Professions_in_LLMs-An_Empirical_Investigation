The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers and the sound of birds chirping in the nearby park. In a small cottage on Elm Street, a young woman named Emilia Rose Wilder was busy preparing for another day at her beloved animal sanctuary.

Emilia, or Mia as she liked to be called, was a 25-year-old animal caretaker with a passion for helping animals in need. She had grown up surrounded by the sounds of barking dogs and chirping birds, and had always known that she wanted to spend her life caring for creatures great and small.
