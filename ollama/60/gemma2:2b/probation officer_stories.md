The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the spartan office at the Crossroads Probation Center.  Rain hammered against the windows, mimicking the relentless drumming of Evelyn Thorne's pulse in her chest. Across from her sat Daniel 'Danny' Jackson, his eyes downcast, hands clenched so tightly they looked white-knuckled.  Evelyn could smell the simmering tension – a cocktail of fear and desperation that hung heavy in the air like an unwelcome guest.

Evelyn was used to dealing with troubled souls. A probation officer in a city teeming with shadows, her days were a whirlwind of meetings, court appearances, and individual sessions. She saw the best and worst of humanity – the desperate yearning for redemption versus the cold, hard reality of criminal behavior.  Tonight, though, something felt different. This wasn't just another case on her plate; this was Danny. He had been charged with a heinous act, one that echoed in the depths of Evelyn’s soul. A murder. 

The setting: Crossroads Probation Center, a stark grey building nestled between the bustling chaos of city life and the decaying whispers of forgotten urban legends.  Its cracked windows were more reminiscent of ancient graffiti than modern architecture, a reflection of the lives trapped within its walls – a constant reminder that even in the most civilized of societies, darkness lurked just beneath the surface.
