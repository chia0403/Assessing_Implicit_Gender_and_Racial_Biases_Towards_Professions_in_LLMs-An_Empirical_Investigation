Rain lashed against the windows of Havenwood Physical Therapy, mirroring the storm brewing in Eleanor "Ellie" Sinclair's soul.  The scent of eucalyptus oil and liniment hung heavy in the air, a testament to the countless hours she'd poured into helping patients regain their mobility. Outside, the city streets were a slick maze of water and shadows, but inside, Ellie was trapped by her own internal storm.  The latest rejection letter from the prestigious New York Physical Therapy Association had landed on her desk, further fueling the anger that simmered within. "They're looking for someone with 'established credentials,' they said," she muttered under her breath, "like it's some kind of magical potion." Ellie knew deep down what it was: a rigged game designed to keep the same old faces at the top.  She hadn’t achieved “established” in just one year; no, this storm had been brewing for years.

Ellie closed her eyes, taking a slow, deliberate breath. The worn wooden desk felt familiar beneath her hands. She opened them again and stared at the framed photo on the wall: her grandmother's smiling face, perched beside her own as they both leaned over to examine a model of the human skeleton with its vibrant, intricate bones. "Always believed you could build something beautiful from even the tiniest pieces," she remembered her grandmother’s voice whisper, her eyes twinkling. 

Suddenly, a patient’s cheerful voice echoed from within the therapy room: “Morning, Ellie! Did I tell you about my new dog? He's adorable!"  Ellie blinked away the lingering storm clouds in her mind and forced a smile. She couldn’t afford to let doubt cloud this day; she had a job to do.
