## Story Opening

The asphalt stretched before Elias like a ribbon woven from sun-baked dreams, its surface shimmering under the relentless gaze of the Georgia sun. Sweat stung his eyes as he ran a calloused thumb over the cracked seam running down his face mask. This was just another Tuesday in the endless expanse of I-85. He worked alongside dozens of others, their faces etched with fatigue and the same weary resignation as the chipped paint on the highway's guardrails. 

Elias, whose real name was Elias Beaumont, but everyone called him "Beam," was a third-generation highway worker. His grandfather'd started out paving back in the '40s and his father had continued the legacy for decades. He'd learned to love the rhythm of it all, the steady hum of the asphalt screener, the rhythmic clang of metal on metal as they laid new sections down. But lately, it had all begun to feel like a monotonous echo, each day blending into the next. 

His gaze drifted towards the horizon, where the sun was starting its descent, painting the sky in fiery hues of orange and red. He sighed, a wave of longing washing over him. He just wanted something different, something that would break the monotony. Something to truly ignite his spirit.
