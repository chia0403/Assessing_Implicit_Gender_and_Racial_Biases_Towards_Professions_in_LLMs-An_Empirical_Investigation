The wind whipped Amelia's brown hair across her face as she surveyed the sprawling expanse of Meadowside Animal Sanctuary. Sunlight dappled through the ancient oaks that lined the perimeter, casting shifting patterns on the dirt path that snaked toward the barn. The sanctuary itself was a kaleidoscope of color and sound: vibrant parrots squawking in their wire cages, playful puppies tumbling amidst piles of hay, and the rhythmic purring of cats curled up on warm blankets.  Amelia, ever the meticulous caretaker, meticulously checked each cage and pen, her calloused hands smoothing out any stray fur or frayed fabric. 

Today, however, a shadow clung to Amelia's heart as thick as the morning mist clinging to the old oak trees. It had been three weeks since she last saw Luna, the majestic snow leopard who roamed free in the sanctuary's remote enclosure.  Amelia knew Luna was notoriously elusive. But when the sanctuary's normally placid staff began raising alarms about her unusual silence and lack of playful interactions with other cats, even Ameliaâ€™s usually calm demeanor had begun to fray.
