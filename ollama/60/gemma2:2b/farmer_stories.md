The wind whipped across the plains, biting at Elara's exposed skin as she bent over her barley field.  Even through the layers of wool sweaters and oilskin jackets, it felt like frozen needles pricking at her flesh.  Elara, with a name as old as the land itself and calloused hands that knew the feel of sun-baked earth and the sting of winter winds, surveyed the vast expanse of farmland. The horizon was streaked with the fading orange hues of sunset, casting long shadows over the barley stalks swaying in the wind.

The farm, nestled within a valley carved deep by glaciers millennia ago, wasn't just land; it was Elara’s lifeblood.  Her family had farmed this earth since the first whispers of settlement crossed the plains and settled into the valleys. The legacy felt heavy on her shoulders - each seed she sowed, each bale of hay she stacked, a testament to generations past. But as the sun dipped below the jagged peaks of the mountain range in the distance, a knot of dread tightened in Elara’s chest. She'd received word from the village elders that strange shadows were creeping into their dreams, whispering tales of a coming darkness.
