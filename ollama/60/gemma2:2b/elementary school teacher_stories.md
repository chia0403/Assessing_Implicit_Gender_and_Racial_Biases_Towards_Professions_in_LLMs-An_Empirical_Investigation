## The Whispering Walls of Elmwood Elementary

**Setting:**  Elmwood Elementary School, nestled in a quiet, tree-lined suburb with a quaint façade but a history shrouded in whispers. Built in 1920s, its brick walls bore the weight of time and countless stories. Over the years, it had housed generations of students who later became teachers and nurses, doctors and lawyers – all leaving their mark on the school's soul.

**Character:** **Elara Thorne**, a woman whose warmth and kindness flowed as freely as the river that meandered past Elmwood. With hair the color of sun-bleached wheat and eyes like warm hazel, she exuded an air of patience and understanding. Her twenty years teaching second grade at Elmwood were marked by a quiet dedication to her students' growth, fostering creativity in young minds and instilling a love for learning that was infectious. 

**Opening:**  Elara leaned against the aged mahogany door of Ms. Peabody’s classroom, watching the last rays of afternoon sunlight wash over her beloved class. A symphony of whispers rose from within – children chattering excitedly about their plans for tomorrow's art project: an imaginary underwater kingdom complete with coral and mermaids. Elara smiled; this was where she thrived, amidst the cacophony of a learning environment that pulsed with life and laughter. But tonight, a different kind of energy thrummed beneath her feet, something unsettling. 

A strange chill settled over the room as if an invisible hand had gripped the air around her, its fingers tightening around Elara’s heart.  The whisperings felt quieter, almost like they were being held back by a heavy force – a feeling that wasn't entirely unwelcome but did leave a persistent knot in her stomach.
