The wind whipped around Elara Thorne's cloak, icy tendrils that seemed to carry the whispers of forgotten secrets. She stood sentinel on the precipice of the Whispering Wall, a granite face that held the weight of centuries against the encroaching storm clouds. The wall itself was an imposing monolith; its towering form blotted out even the most vibrant hues of the sunset, leaving the sky a canvas of bruised purple and blood orange.  Elara's breath formed fleeting white specks in the frigid air as she stared across the desolate plain towards the crumbling ruins of Eldoria - the city that was once home to her people.

For generations, her family had patrolled these treacherous borders, their duty a solemn oath sworn under the watchful gaze of ancient sigils etched on stone.  They were charged with protecting the Veil, a magical barrier that held back the encroaching darkness from spilling into the world beyond. Elara, like her ancestors before her, was expected to do the same. But as she gazed at the desolate landscape, a gnawing unease settled in her stomach.  The whispers of the wind were growing louder, carrying with them an undercurrent of fear and foreboding that sent a shiver down her spine. She could feel it; something was different tonight.
