## The Quiet Classroom

**Setting:** A crumbling brick building on the edge of a forgotten suburb.  The air hangs thick with anticipation in room 204, lit by bare bulbs buzzing precariously above overflowing desks. This was Ms. Amelia Crane's classroom - a space where history whispered through faded textbooks and teenage angst simmered beneath a veneer of quiet decorum.

**Character:** Amelia Crane, or "Mrs. C" as the students called her, stood in the doorway, adjusting her worn tweed coat. A lifetime of teaching this particular blend of apathy and adolescent defiance had honed her patience to a razor's edge.  Her grey eyes, perpetually etched with years of observing the complexities of youth, surveyed the classroom's chaotic tableau. 

**Opening:** "Alright class," Mrs. Crane's voice boomed through the room like an echo of past teachers' warnings, "Remember today's assignment: Research the lives of influential women in history. I want to see your voices, not just your dates."  She paused, her gaze sweeping over the sea of blank faces before settling on the one student who looked truly lost in thought â€“ a girl with messy black hair and eyes that seemed too old for this school.
