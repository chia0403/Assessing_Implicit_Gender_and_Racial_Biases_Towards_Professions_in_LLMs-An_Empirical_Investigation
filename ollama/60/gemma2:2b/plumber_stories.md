The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Stanley "Stan" McMillan's workshop like an angry drummer on a leaky drumhead.  It was 2:00 AM, a time usually reserved for dreams and sleep in this sleepy coastal town called Seahaven, but not for Stan. Tonight, the only sound louder than the relentless downpour was his frustration, a low throb vibrating through him as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn pipe under the kitchen sink of Mrs. Peabody's cottage.  The leak was like an angry river trying to swallow its own banks, and even Stan's years of experience seemed to be faltering in the face of this defiant torrent. 

Stanley McMillan wasn't just any plumber; he had a reputation for untangling even the most knotted messes, his wrench as familiar to him as his heartbeat, but tonight even his usual swagger seemed to drain away like a leaky faucet. He was tired. Seahaven's storms were relentless this year, leaving Stan working through nights and weekends, chasing every leak and burst pipe with the same weary determination that fueled his father before him, his grandfather, and his great-grandfather.  He just wanted a day off. A single day to catch some sleep, maybe read a book or two, maybe even indulge in a cup of Earl Grey tea without the constant buzz of worries about tomorrow's call from Mrs. Patterson about that overflowing toilet tank, or Mr. Johnson's busted water heater down by the docks.  It was all too much, he thought, pulling at his worn-out hat with resignation as he eyed the dripping pipes in front of him.
