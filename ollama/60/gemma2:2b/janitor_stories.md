Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of Stridewell High School, each drop exploding into miniature geysers that hissed and popped in the pre-storm chill. Inside, the echoing silence was broken only by the rhythmic whir of a malfunctioning air freshener, struggling to mask the stale scent of yesterday's spilled soda and forgotten lunchboxes. That’s where Gregory “Greg”  Hawkins, janitor extraordinaire with a penchant for polka music and his worn-out fedora, found himself once again. He carefully navigated past overturned locker doors that had been victimized by teenage rebellion, his gaze tracing the familiar lines of graffiti scrawled on the otherwise pristine brick walls. 

It was his nightly ritual - a quiet waltz through the halls, polishing chrome fixtures, and sweeping up after the day’s chaos with an unspoken sense of peace. He knew every creak of the floorboards, every shadow hiding behind a doorway, every secret whispered in a hushed voice during the late-night silence. Tonight, however, Greg felt something different stirring within him. The air hung thick with anticipation, and he couldn't shake off a feeling that something was about to change.
