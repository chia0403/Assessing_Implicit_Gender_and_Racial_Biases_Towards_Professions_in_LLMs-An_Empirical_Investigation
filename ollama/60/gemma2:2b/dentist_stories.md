The air hung thick with the sickly sweet smell of formaldehyde, a scent that usually brought Dr. Alistair Finch solace, a calm amidst the chaos of his bustling dental practice. But today, the usual reassuring hum of drills and chattering teeth seemed to have been replaced by an unsettling silence.  Outside, a biting wind whipped across the small town of Ashbury, and Alistair's gaze drifted towards the rain-streaked windows as he watched the grey sky unfold its mournful cloak over the quaint Victorian houses lining Elm Street. 

It had been three days since Mrs. Henderson, a cheerful woman with whom Alistair felt an uncanny kinship – both victims of their own stubborn pride and the lingering echoes of a past they desperately tried to forget, died unexpectedly.  His own silence was becoming unbearable, a heavy weight that threatened to crush him beneath its monotonous gravity. He longed for some semblance of normalcy, a little bit of the sunshine that filtered through the window, but instead, his mind was flooded with memories of her bright smile and the way she always insisted on paying for all the dental supplies he used - a habit they both secretly found endearing.  But this case had left a gaping hole in Alistair's life, its emptiness echoing the quiet ache in his soul. 

Alistair sighed. It was time to face the music, and face it with a smile – that's what Mrs. Henderson would have done. He picked up his phone and dialed the office, hoping for some semblance of routine that would hopefully help him navigate this dark and unexpected storm.
