## Story Opening

The fluorescent hum of the office was as familiar to Amelia as her own heartbeat.  Her worn nameplate on the reception desk felt like a badge that perpetually declared "Invisible." The glass panes of the front window reflected not the bustling city outside, but the ever-present grey of the corporate cubicle farm in which she worked. Amelia wasn't just another receptionist; she was Agnes Blackwood's personal assistant - and that meant everything from managing the office coffee machine to ensuring the CEO didn't burn dinner at 7pm sharp.

Amelia sighed, glancing over a mountain of unopened mail before her eyes landed on an envelope tucked into a stack.  A single, stark black feather rested atop the pile like a tiny, menacing omen. It was addressed simply, "For Amelia." This wasn't a routine delivery - this was different.
