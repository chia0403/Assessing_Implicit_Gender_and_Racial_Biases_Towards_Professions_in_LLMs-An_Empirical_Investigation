## Setting: The Saltwind Saloon, a dusty dive bar in Dustbowl, Oklahoma

**The Story:** 

It wasn't supposed to be this way.  A town called Dustbowl was more dust than soul, but even as he watched the sun set over the parched landscape, setting his dreams ablaze with orange and red hues, there was a flicker of something else in Ezra "Razor" Riley's eyes: hope. 

Ezra wasn't just a hair cutter; he was the only barber in this ramshackle town, and for years he had been the town’s unofficial therapist. His clippers hummed like a promise, and his hands moved with a rhythm that spoke of stories untold and lives lived. The Saltwind Saloon was his stage, a stage where dust storms met dreams as they did every night.

**Scene 1:**  The saloon's worn wooden floorboards creaked beneath Ezra’s feet as he entered the dimly lit space.  A lone figure sat in the corner booth, bathed in a faint blue light from a flickering neon sign advertising 'Whiskey & Wild Nights.'  His face was shadowed and weathered, etched with lines that whispered of hard living.

This man, John "Dusty" Callahan, wasn't looking for his usual haircut; he was looking for answers. He had come to Razor seeking solace in the hum of clippers and the rhythmic snip-snip of shears. 


**Ezra stood there, a silhouette against the saloon’s flickering neon, his hands held high like an offering.**

"Dusty," he said with a wry smile, his voice a low rumble echoing through the room, "I know you're not here for a trim." His gaze swept over the man's face, searching for something that only he knew.
