## Story Opening

**Setting:** A crumbling old theatre in a forgotten seaside town, bathed in the golden glow of a dying sun. Salt-spray stings the air as the wind whips through rusted balcony seats that creak with each gust. 

**Main Character:**  Evelyn Thorne, known to her friends and colleagues simply as "Evie." She's a woman etched with lines not just of age, but of untold stories whispered in the rustle of old fabric on her worn Leica camera bag. The faded red lipstick on her lips mirrors the dying embers of the setting sun.

**Opening:**

"They call it 'The Phantom', this derelict shell of a theatre," Evie muttered to herself, adjusting the strap of her worn leather satchel. "But to me, it's just another canvas." She stepped into the cavernous space, her heels clicking on the dusty floorboards like staccato notes in an abandoned symphony. The air was thick with dust motes dancing in the dying light and a faint, earthy scent of decay that seemed to cling to every corner.  Her eyes, however, were not looking at the peeling paint or crumbling plaster, but at the stage door, waiting for her muse.

"There," she murmured, spotting a figure huddled against the wall, shrouded by a heavy curtain. "A little performance for us."


This opening sets the scene and introduces Evie as a photographer driven by an undeniable passion for the forgotten and lost corners of the world. It hints at a deeper story behind her, one that will unfold through her lens.
