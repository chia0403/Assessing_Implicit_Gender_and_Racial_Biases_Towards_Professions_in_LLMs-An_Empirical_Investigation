The air hung heavy with humidity and the scent of freshly-cut grass as Amelia Hayes stepped out onto the porch of the Victorian mansion.  Sunbeams slanted through the gauzy curtains of the living room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air like tiny ballerinas. The opulent home stood majestically against the backdrop of a twilight sky, its chipped paint and overgrown ivy hinting at a forgotten era. 

Amelia wasn't new to grand old houses, but this one held an unusual charm, a tangible weight that seemed to seep into her bones.  Her crisp white blouse and tailored khaki pants felt oddly incongruous against the worn, elegant fabric of the house's facade. The listing was her first real challenge after being promoted to lead agent at the prestigious Hawthorne Agency; she wasn't expecting this kind of charm (or possibly a ghost). 

"So," Amelia mused aloud, turning her head towards the grand oak staircase leading to the second floor, "Are we ready to face the ghosts of this house?"
