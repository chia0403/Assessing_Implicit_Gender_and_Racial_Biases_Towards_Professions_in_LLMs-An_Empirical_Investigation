## Opening & Setting

**Opening:**  The air hung thick with the scent of freshly cut lilies and lavender, an unwelcome reminder of Ameliaâ€™s recent emotional breakdown. The grand living room of her client's manor was supposed to be a haven for rejuvenation, but all she could see were the chipped teacups that had been left on the ornate table, the faded floral wallpaper that seemed to mock her with its dusty grandeur. It wasn't supposed to feel like this; Amelia dreamt of creating cozy, vibrant spaces that made people feel alive, not melancholic.  

**Name:** Amelia Hawthorne 

**Setting:** The story takes place in a sprawling Victorian-era manor hidden amidst rolling hills and ivy-covered walls. This secluded haven serves as the backdrop for Amelia's work, yet it seems to be actively resisting her attempts at bringing life and joy into its aging halls. The manor belongs to a wealthy but melancholic widower named Lord Edmund Blackwood, who has entrusted Amelia with transforming his home into something resembling a semblance of happiness after years of solitude. 


**What happens next?** Will Amelia succeed in making the manor feel like a true haven for Lord Blackwood's soul? How will she navigate her own emotional turmoil amidst the grandeur and secrets of the house?
