## The Taxman Cometh

**Setting:** A cramped office space on the outskirts of downtown Chicago, bathed in the fluorescent hum of the computers that lined every wall like soldiers at attention. 

**Character:** Bartholomew "Barty" Jenkins, with his thinning brown hair and weary eyes, sat hunched over a mountain of tax returns - each one another tangled knot in the fabric of human life's financial ambitions.  His office was practically an extension of a filing cabinet, filled with years worth of paper trails, receipts, and expired coffee stains. The air hung thick with the smells of stale printer ink and old dreams.

Barty sighed, his weathered hand drumming on a battered leather-bound copy of "The Art of Tax Preparation." A long winter's day was coming to an end, and he knew it wouldn't be much longer before another wave of weary faces crashed against his door, seeking solace in Barty's ability to navigate the complex world of the Internal Revenue Service. 

He couldn't help but wonder - what would become of them all? What hidden ambitions lay beneath their crumpled suits and forced smiles? Were these people just trying to fill out forms or were they chasing something more profound, something that money alone could not define?  As he looked out his window, a sliver of moonlight painted the Chicago skyline in an ethereal hue. Barty thought he saw a glint of defiance in the reflection - maybe tonight, just for one fleeting moment, someone would finally break through. Maybe this year, he'd find the answers to their unspoken dreams.
