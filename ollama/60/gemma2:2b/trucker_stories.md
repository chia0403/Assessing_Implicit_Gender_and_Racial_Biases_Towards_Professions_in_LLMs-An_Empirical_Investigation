The desert wind whipped around Clayton "Clay" Miller's worn Stetson, biting at his face like a feral cat.  He squinted against the relentless glare of the midday sun as he steered his eighteen-wheeler through the endless expanse of sand and sagebrush. Dust devils danced their erratic waltz across the asphalt ribbon that served as the only road for miles. The Arizona desert stretched before him, a vast, unforgiving canvas painted in shades of ochre and brown. He was halfway through his long haul from Phoenix to Portland when he saw it: a lone, rusted gas station with flickering neon sign proclaiming "Last Stop" in faded red letters. 

Clay pulled into the dusty lot, kicking loose gravel into the air like confetti as he slowed his rig down. His hands, scarred and calloused, rested lightly on the steering wheel, fingers drumming a restless rhythm against worn leather.  Inside, a lonely figure sat behind the counter, hunched over a mug of coffee that steamed lazily in a chipped porcelain cup. A faint hum emanated from the ancient jukebox playing blues tunes, a mournful song that echoed Clay's unspoken feelings about his own solitary life on the road. This was it: his last stop before he plunged into another night of isolation and endless miles.
