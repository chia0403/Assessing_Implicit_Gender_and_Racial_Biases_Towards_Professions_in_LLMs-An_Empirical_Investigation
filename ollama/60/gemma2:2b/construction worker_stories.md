The wind whipped through the skeletal frame of the unfinished skyscraper, tugging at Elias "Eli" Reed's worn denim jacket like it was trying to snatch him into the swirling abyss. He perched precariously on a rusty scaffolding ladder, his gaze fixed on the steel skeleton rising from the ground like an untethered bird against the bruised sky.  The air held a metallic tang, a mix of dust and sweat. It was another day in the heart of New York's grittiest construction zone, where concrete giants struggled to be born under the unforgiving glare of summer sun. Eli squinted at the jagged skyline, the promise of his family dinner and his daughter’s bedtime story flickering like a distant firefly in his mind. He needed that warm light tonight more than ever.
