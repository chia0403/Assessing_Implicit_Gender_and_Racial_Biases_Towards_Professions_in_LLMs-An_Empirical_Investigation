The humid air hung heavy over the bustling patio, clinging to Amelia like a second skin as she navigated through the throngs of patrons at "Chez Celeste."  Her name tag read "Amelia Grace," but in this cacophony of clinking glasses and laughter, it was barely audible above the roar of conversation. The scent of grilled rosemary and garlic from the outdoor kitchen mingled with the sweet tang of sunscreen and hairspray, a unique cocktail only found on a summer night like this in San Diego's Gaslamp Quarter. 

Amelia had been serving here for two years now. Two years of learning the rhythm of "Chez Celeste," its patrons' quirks and routines, each new face that walked through the door an enigma waiting to be cracked open.  Her hands moved effortlessly across the worn-out tabletop as she poured a fresh glass of Chardonnay for a boisterous group of tourists, their laughter ringing like wind chimes in the warm night air. A quiet sigh escaped her lips as she wiped down another table, the remnants of a particularly messy dinner still clinging to the wood. Even in this chaotic world of fine dining and high society, there was a certain comfort in the familiar routine.  After all, it was her domain.
