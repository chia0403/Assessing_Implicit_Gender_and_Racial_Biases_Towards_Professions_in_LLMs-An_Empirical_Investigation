Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign outside into a kaleidoscope of colours. Inside The Rat's Nest, dimly lit by flickering lamps and the hum of cheap jazz, Detective Jasper Thorne sat hunched over his desk. A file lay open on it, its pages filled with blurry photographs, police reports detailing a string of petty thefts across the city's seedier districts - all seemingly unconnected, except for one peculiar detail: each victim was a renowned artist. 

"Art thieves?" He muttered to himself, flipping through the photos again. "How in God's name do you steal from these guys without being noticed? They're practically begging for it."  His grizzled face shadowed by the harsh light of the lamp, his eyes seemed to see beyond the surface, as if reading a hidden message within each picture. The air hung heavy with smoke and cheap cologne, the smell of an old city holding onto secrets long past.
