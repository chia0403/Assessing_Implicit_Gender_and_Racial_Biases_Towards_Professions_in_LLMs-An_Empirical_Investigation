The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow across the cluttered rows of ledgers lining Amelia "Amy" Thornton's desk.  Her cramped office smelled faintly of stale coffee and aging paper; a scent as familiar to her as the humdrum rhythm of her life.  For years, the ledger had been her universe, each entry a testament to the intricate dance of income and expense that kept Mr. Fitzwilliamâ€™s antique shop afloat.  But tonight, something felt different. 

The air held an unwelcome tang of rain and an unnerving stillness hung over the bustling town square just outside her window. Amelia watched as shadows stretched from the cobblestones, casting grotesque shapes on the grimy brick wall. The once lively atmosphere was now a hushed whisper, waiting for the storm to break.  Mr. Fitzwilliam's shop had been closed since dawn, his usual boisterous greeting replaced by the ominous silence of a town holding its breath.
