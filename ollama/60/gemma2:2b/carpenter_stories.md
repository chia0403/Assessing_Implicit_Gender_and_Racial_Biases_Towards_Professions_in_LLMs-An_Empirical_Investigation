The air in Blackwood Creek was thick with the scent of cedar and pine, but it held no solace for Elias Hawthorne. His calloused hands, worn smooth by years of crafting fine furniture, tightened around his hammer. The wood he used wasn’t just timber; it was memories etched upon its grain – the laughter of his childhood, the sorrow of a lost love, the quiet joy of his grandfather's passing – all woven into each intricate piece. 

The workshop sat nestled behind Blackwood's oldest church, its weathered clapboard siding and crooked chimney a familiar sight to Elias. It was here he found solace, his sanctuary from the unforgiving town that whispered judgment on every creak and groan of his soul.  He had refused to build anything that would stir those gossiping tongues – nothing flashy or ostentatious, just solid furniture with quiet dignity. But tonight, the weight of unspoken grief threatened to smother him. 

His wife, Mary, would be back soon from town with groceries and a smile as warm as the hearth fire she tended. She'd ask about his day, her gaze full of love, and he’d tell her stories of wood and dreams, just like he always did. But tonight, all he could hear were the mournful whispers of the wind through the ancient oak trees, each gust carrying a reminder that something was terribly, terribly wrong.
