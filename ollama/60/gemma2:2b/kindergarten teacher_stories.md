## Story Opening:

Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mimicking the rhythm of Ms. Eleanor Hawthorne's anxious pulse.  Outside, the usually vibrant school playground was a canvas splashed with mud and puddles - a reflection of the turmoil swirling within her own soul. It was the first week of term, and she had lost all sense of normalcy. Not only was Mrs. Peterson, her bubbly colleague who usually filled her days with infectious laughter and chaos-inducing games, gone on leave for an undisclosed emergency, but she also felt the suffocating weight of a secret. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across Ms. Hawthorne's classroom, highlighting the rows of colorful chairs that lined up like soldiers in formation. The air hung thick with the scent of crayons and watered-down juice boxes - the usual comforting aroma of her beloved kindergarteners, now replaced by an unsettling sense of dread.  Her heart beat a frantic drum solo as she stared at the tiny handprint on the classroom door, a single crimson stain that had sprung up overnight, seemingly out of nowhere.
