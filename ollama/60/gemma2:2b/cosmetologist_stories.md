The worn linoleum floor beneath Amelia "Amy" Sterling's boots hummed with a dull, persistent energy that was as much a part of her salon as the scent of lavender and citrus air freshener that always seemed to 
linger in its cozy corners.  Her fingers, deft and practiced, danced over the thick strands of hair, coaxing out the intricate braids she'd woven for Mrs. Henderson, whose wedding was less than two weeks away. 

The year was 1953, and the air hung heavy with the humidity of a summer afternoon in New Orleans. The wrought-iron balconies outside creaked their usual symphony against the ever-present humidity, while a gentle 
drizzle occasionally pattered down like whispered secrets on the window panes. Amy’s salon, "The French Quarter Touch," stood nestled between a bustling deli and an antique shop, its faded sign barely visible 
against the backdrop of vibrant awnings and blooming crepe myrtle trees. The only sound louder than the gentle hum of the fan was the steady murmur of gossip and hushed conversation that flowed through the doors 
like a tide of secrets. 


Amy had built her career on crafting memories for her clients, each strand of hair, each carefully-applied curl, weaving a tangible story into their lives. But lately, something was different. The usual quiet hum 
of anticipation was gone, replaced by an unsettling silence that clung to the salon like a cold draft.  Mrs. Henderson's wedding wasn’t only a milestone; it was also a turning point for Amy and her beloved career.
