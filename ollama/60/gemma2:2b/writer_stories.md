The rain hammered against the attic window like a thousand tiny fists, each blow echoing through the cavernous space. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Thorne hunched over her battered typewriter, the warm glow of the desk lamp illuminating her face in a stark contrast to the shadowy room around her. The air was thick with dust and the scent of old paper, reminding Amy of the endless hours she'd spent amidst these walls, her fingers flying across the keys, weaving tales of daring knights and fantastical creatures into existence.

The year was 1943, a time when war had painted the world in shades of grey, and even her meticulously crafted worlds seemed pale compared to the stark reality unfolding outside. Amy's current project: "The Shadow of Avalon," a historical fantasy set against the backdrop of World War II - where magic existed not as a fantastical embellishment but as a weapon used in the shadows of conflict. 

With each page she wrote, however, the line between fiction and reality blurred. The more she immersed herself in the world she was creating, the harder it became to distinguish her own life from the characters she had brought to life.  The weight of the impending war hung heavy on Amy's shoulders, a tangible presence that pressed down even as she dreamt of dragons and heroic deeds.
