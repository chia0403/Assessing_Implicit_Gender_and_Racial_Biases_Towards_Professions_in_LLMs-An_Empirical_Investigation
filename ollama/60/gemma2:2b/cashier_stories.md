Rain splattered against the grimy windowpanes of "Bob's Best Buys," each drop echoing like tiny drumbeats in Amelia “Amy” Jones’ ears. Her world was the hum of the cash register, the occasional customer complaint, and the endless cycle of restocking discounted trinkets from last week’s clearance sale. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, painting everything in a sickly yellow that did little to mask the weariness gnawing at her soul. Outside, a symphony of downpour played on the pavement, blurring into a grey canvas of city streets. Tonight was Thursday, which meant the after-midnight shift, and Amy couldn't shake off the feeling that something ominous awaited her within those steel-lined doors. 


**Setting:** A rundown corner store in a bustling, yet forgotten neighborhood of a major city.
 
**Main Character:**  Amelia "Amy" Jones, a weary cashier haunted by a past she tries to bury deep within the endless stacks of discounted trinkets.
