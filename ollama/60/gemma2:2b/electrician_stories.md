## Setting: The Rust Belt

**The year is 2045.**  Heavy rain lashes against the boarded windows of the old factory building on Main Street, blurring the neon glow of the nearby strip mall with streaks of gray and orange. The air hangs thick and stagnant, buzzing with unseen energy from a world that ran on coal just decades ago but now struggles to find its footing in a rapidly shifting climate. 

**Name:**  Elias "Eli" Thorne

Eli stands inside the skeletal remains of a former steel mill, his brow furrowed as he scans the blueprints laid out on the cold concrete floor. The air is stale and heavy with the scent of copper wiring and the faint ghost of past industry. He runs his calloused fingers over the worn paper, tracing the intricate network of wires that will soon bring life back to this forgotten corner of America – a life powered by sustainable energy, fueled by solar arrays and wind turbines, all carefully calibrated and integrated into the aging infrastructure. 

Eli is no stranger to working with old systems, but even he can't help but feel the weight of history pressing down on him as he contemplates the task at hand. He's a master electrician, known for his meticulous nature and ability to solve any electrical problem – even when it seems insurmountable.  But this project feels different. 

This isn't just about wiring lights or fixing appliances; it's about rebuilding a community, reclaiming lost hope, and breathing life back into a dying town. And as the rain continues its relentless assault on the dilapidated building, Eli knows he has to get started, even if just to make sure his own legacy doesn't become another forgotten story in this rust belt city.
