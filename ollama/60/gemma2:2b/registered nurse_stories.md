## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the windows of the small hospital room like tiny fists pounding on glass. Inside, Evelyn Thorne, RN, stood at the foot of a bed draped in sterile white sheets. Her normally cheerful demeanor was etched with worry lines, her brow creased as she observed the patient's frail form nestled beneath a mountain of blankets. 

"Anything new, Miss Thorne?" asked Mrs. Henderson, the night shift supervisor, her voice weary from countless rounds and endless paperwork. Evelyn shook her head, her gaze fixed on the young woman whose chest rose and fell with labored breaths. "Nothing yet. But I can't shake this feeling."  

The room reeked of disinfectant, a faint metallic tang in its air. The clock on the wall ticked relentlessly, each second a hammer blow against Evelyn's heart. Across the narrow hallway, she could hear the distant hum of fluorescent lights and the rhythmic clanging of machines. It was her 10th night shift this week, battling fatigue, battling fear, fighting to stay afloat in a sea of uncertainty.  


**Setting:**

The story takes place at Harmony Medical Center, a bustling hospital on the outskirts of a small city in the Midwest. The atmosphere is one of tension and urgency, reflecting the anxieties of both patients and staff alike.
