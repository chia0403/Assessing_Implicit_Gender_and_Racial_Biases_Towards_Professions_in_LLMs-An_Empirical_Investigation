The morning air hung thick with the scent of burnt toast and anxiety.  Amelia "Amy" Carter, a woman whose own life felt as chaotic as the playground outside her door, was already running behind schedule.  She’d only been assigned to this tiny after-school program at St. Michael's church for a month, but it felt like a lifetime of chaos in training, fueled by six rambunctious eight-year-olds and a constant stream of mismatched socks. 

The small building nestled amongst the towering oak trees had never quite felt welcoming, despite its warm paint and vibrant murals.  A tangle of bright red yarn clung to the corner bookshelf, like a macabre reminder that every room held something unexpected. Today’s chaos was set in motion by Timmy's insistence on wearing his unicorn costume as he marched through the kitchen.  He’d insisted on being “ready for adventure” even though his "adventure" involved a spilled carton of milk and an hour-long battle with a rogue crayon box, leaving behind a trail of sticky, rainbow chaos. 

The windowsill held a lone robin's nest, where tiny feathers peeked out through the woven twigs.  Amy sighed as she glanced at the birds’ nest, wishing for a peaceful morning like her childhood days spent chasing butterflies in sun-drenched meadows. Today’s “adventure” felt more like a runaway train with no conductor.
