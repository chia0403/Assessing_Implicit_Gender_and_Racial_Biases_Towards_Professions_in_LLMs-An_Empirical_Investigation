The wind howled through the towering pines, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and fallen leaves.  A lone figure, his silhouette sharp against the dying embers of the sunset, leaned heavily against the rough-hewn stump of an old oak. The flames in its hollow were sputtering their last breaths, casting long, dancing shadows across the clearing. This was Silas Blackwood’s domain, a land where he'd carved his life for decades –  the smell of sawdust and pine sap interwoven with the ghosts of men who'd come before him. 

His name wasn't just "Silas" - it was as synonymous with the forest itself as the ancient trees that stood tall and stoic around him. He was a logger, born to the scent of wood and water, raised by his grandfather's stories of towering redwoods and whispering pines.  He understood their language, felt their pulse in the tremor of each freshly-cut tree, knew their strength and their vulnerability like an old friend who whispered secrets only he could understand. 

But tonight, a strange unease gnawed at him. It was the type of quiet that held unspoken warnings, an unsettling stillness unlike anything he’d known before. The wind seemed to carry whispers, not of life but of something… else.  His eyes, shadowed by years of working in the sun and under the pale moonlight, caught a flicker of movement from the edge of his vision.
