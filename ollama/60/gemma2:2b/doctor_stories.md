## The Weight of Healing

**Setting:** A desolate research facility nestled amidst rolling hills near the frozen shores of Greenland. Snow clings to everything with an almost suffocating intensity, and even the wind seems hushed, holding its breath for something unspoken. The only source of light comes from flickering fluorescent tubes that cast a sickly green glow on steel cabinets lined with empty vials and dusty lab equipment.

**Main character:** Dr. Esme Thorne, her sharp, blue eyes perpetually narrowed in thought. Despite her youthful face and bright attire, the weight of responsibility seems to have etched itself into the lines around her eyes; the unspoken burden of countless lives entrusted to her care. She runs a clinic in this remote outpost, one of many scattered across the Arctic, but it remains strangely isolated from the rest. 

**Opening:** A heavy silence hung in the air as Dr. Thorne walked through the empty corridors of the clinic. The biting winds whipped at the lab coat she wore, its familiar warmth failing to penetrate the chilling solitude that clung to the facility like a shroud. She stopped by an old wooden door marked "Patient Records," and hesitated before pushing it open. A pile of crumpled papers lay on the desk, each one whispering tales of despair, resilience, and the relentless march of time. Each patient file was a story she'd been forced to read over and over, each one echoing the same silent cry for help: *Please, doctor, I just need some peace.*
