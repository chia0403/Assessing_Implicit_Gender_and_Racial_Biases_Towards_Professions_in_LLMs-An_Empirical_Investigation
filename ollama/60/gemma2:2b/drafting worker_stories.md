## Story Opening:

Rain lashed against the window, a steady rhythm that mirrored Amelia's restless heartbeat. The flickering fluorescent lights of the drafting room buzzed like trapped wasps.  Outside, the wind howled through the old factory walls, carrying with it the faint scent of rust and forgotten dreams. Amelia hunched over her desk, the thin paper blueprints in her hands trembling slightly. Each line, each curve, seemed to taunt her, mocking the fear gripping her chest.

**Name:** Amelia Hayes
**Setting:** Old Mill City, Detroit - a run-down industrial complex turned into artist studios and workshops, clinging to its past glory while struggling to keep up with the city's rapid evolution. 


This is just the beginning!  What are some more details you would like to explore:

* **Amelia's fears:** What exactly is she afraid of? Is it failing the project, losing her job, or something else entirely?
* **The drafting room:**  Is this a shared space with other draftspersons, or is Amelia working in isolation? How does the room look and feel? 
* **The blueprints:** What type of project is she working on? What makes them so important to Amelia?
