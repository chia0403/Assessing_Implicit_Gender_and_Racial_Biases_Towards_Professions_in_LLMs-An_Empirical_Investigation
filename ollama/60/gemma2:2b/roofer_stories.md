Rain hammered against the tin roof of  Edgar "Eggy" Thorne's truck as he pulled into the driveway. The mud clung to his worn work boots like lemmings to a sinking ship, each drop leaving muddy streaks on the faded denim of his overalls. 27 years and thousands of jobs later, Eggy still felt the familiar sting of rain on his skin - it was the smell of grit, of weathered wood, of home-cooked meals. But this job in Maple Ridge had a different kind of bite to it. The house looked like it'd been through a hurricane, and the way the wind clawed at the peeling paint around the windows made Eggy feel like he needed to grab hold of something solid.  He climbed out, his worn-down toolbox clinking against his legs, and surveyed the scene with a frown. 

**Setting:** Maple Ridge, a small town nestled between rolling hills, known for its quiet charm and even quieter secrets. The air hangs thick with humidity and the promise of rain, punctuated by the unsettling silence that follows a storm.
