##  The Grand Empire Hotel

**Setting:** The grand entrance to the opulent Grand Empire Hotel in New York City during its roaring twenties era. Gleaming chandeliers shimmered overhead, casting intricate patterns on the mahogany floor. Crimson velvet curtains framed ornate mirrors that reflected faces both wealthy and curious, their eyes alight with excitement as they entered the hotel's lobby for the first time. 

**Character:**  The name echoing down the hallway was **Elias Thorne**. A young man of barely 20 years old, Elias worked as a bell hop at the Grand Empire, his days filled with carrying luggage and ensuring each guest's arrival was as smooth and elegant as the hotel itself.  His dark hair fell across his forehead in waves, and a perpetual air of quiet determination sat beneath his bright blue eyes. 

**Opening:** The late afternoon sun cast long shadows on Elias' boots as he stood before the grand lobby doors, taking deep breaths to quell the nervous flutter in his stomach. Tonight was the debut party for the new "Black Diamond" suite, a room rumored to hold secrets and fortunes of its own, and Elias had been entrusted with the guest list - a daunting task considering the clientele that frequented this city's most luxurious establishment. 

Tonight, he would carry more than just luggage.  He carried the hopes of his family, who depended on him for their livelihood after years of struggle. He was determined to ensure each guest felt welcomed and pampered â€“ perhaps even earning a hint of Elias' own magic in the process.
