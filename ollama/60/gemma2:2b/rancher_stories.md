The sun beat down on Jebediah "Jeb" Cartwright's weathered face as he adjusted his worn Stetson. The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and sagebrush, a familiar comfort in the vastness of Montana's grasslands.  His boots clicked rhythmically on the cracked dirt road that snaked its way towards the sprawling ranch – Blackfoot Ridge - his legacy for over four generations. Jeb had inherited it from his father, a man whose weathered hands could coax life out of even the most stubborn earth. He'd learned to respect the land, just like he'd learned to respect the cattle – gentle giants, yet with an iron will of their own.  

Blackfoot Ridge stretched as far as the eye could see - a mosaic of golden fields, shimmering creeks, and the imposing shadow of the Blackfoot Mountains.  Jeb was alone for now, except for the usual company of his dogs - Daisy and Bandit, who greeted him with enthusiastic yelps.  He knew the ranch's rhythms like his own heartbeat – morning chores to round up the cattle, then a siesta under the blistering Montana sun. But this afternoon, something different lingered in the air – an unsettling tension that he couldn’t quite place.
