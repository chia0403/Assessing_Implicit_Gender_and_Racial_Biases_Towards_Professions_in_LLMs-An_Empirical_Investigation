The rhythmic thump of bass pulsed through Amelia Rose Cartwright's worn sneakers as she herded the gaggle of giggling toddlers towards the art table. Crayons clattered against plastic trays, unleashing a cacophony of colour that somehow only heightened the already overwhelming noise level of "Rainbow Room."

Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows of the dilapidated community centre, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air. The walls were adorned with faded finger paintings and lopsided handprints, testament to the countless tiny artists who had passed through this space.  A faint scent of disinfectant mingled with the sugary sweetness emanating from a forgotten juice box, creating a uniquely nostalgic aroma Amelia associated with childhood itself.

Today, however, something felt different. A strange tension hummed beneath the surface of the usual joyful chaos. Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched, scrutinized by unseen eyes. It prickled at her skin, an unwelcome shiver down her spine.
