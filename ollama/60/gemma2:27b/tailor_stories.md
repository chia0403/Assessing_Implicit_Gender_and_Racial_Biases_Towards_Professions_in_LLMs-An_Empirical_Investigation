The bell above the door of "Finnian's Fashions" jingled mournfully as another gust of wind whipped down Drury Lane.  Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the gaslights into anemic halos. Inside, Alistair Finnian sighed, his breath fogging the air already thick with the scent of damp wool and mothballs. He straightened a crooked mannequin adorned in a dusty velvet frock coat, its glass eyes staring blankly into the gloom. Business had been dismal since the factory closed down, leaving Drury Lane awash in unemployed men who no longer needed fine suits for their jobs.

Alistair ran a calloused thumb over a seam on his waistcoat, the intricate embroidery a testament to his skill. He was known throughout the neighborhood as the finest tailor this side of the Thames, able to conjure garments that fit like a second skin and made even the humblest man feel like a lord.  But what good was talent when there were no customers left to appreciate it?
