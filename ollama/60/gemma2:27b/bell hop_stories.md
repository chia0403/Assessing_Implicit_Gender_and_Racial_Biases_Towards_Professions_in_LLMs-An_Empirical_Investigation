The lobby of the Grand Majestic Hotel throbbed with a constant low hum – a symphony of clinking silverware from the dining hall, hushed conversations in velvet booths, and the rhythmic thump of suitcases on polished marble floors. Alistair Finchley, his crisp uniform straining slightly against his broad shoulders, expertly weaved through the human tapestry, a bellhop navigating his familiar domain. The air hung heavy with the scent of lilies and expensive cologne, a heady mix that both soothed and unsettled him. Alistair had dreamt of working here since he was a boy, mesmerized by the stories his grandmother, a former maid at the Grand Majestic, would tell about the glamorous guests and opulent lifestyle within its walls. 

Now, three years into his employment, the sheen of grandeur had dulled somewhat. The endless stream of demanding travelers, their suitcases overflowing with designer luggage and inflated egos, wore him down. Still, Alistair held onto a flicker of hope – that perhaps one day, he’d encounter a guest who would see past the uniform, past the bellhop façade, and recognize the young man yearning for something more.  Today, however, seemed like any other. The midday sun streamed through the arched windows, casting long shadows across the ornate Persian rugs. Alistair braced himself for another onslaught of arrivals, his trolley poised, ready to swallow their worldly possessions. Little did he know, this arrival would be unlike any he’d encountered before.
