Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Isabella "Izzy" Diaz's car, blurring the neon glow of the 'Open 24 Hours' sign across the street. The greasy spoon diner was the only beacon of life on this deserted stretch of Elmwood Avenue, its fluorescent hum a counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the storm. Izzy sighed, her breath fogging the windshield for a fleeting moment before being whisked away by the wind. She glanced at the address scrawled on the crumpled piece of paper in her hand: 237 Elmwood Ave. The scene of another senseless act of violence in a city already drowning in them.  

This was Izzy's third homicide this week, and she couldn't shake the feeling that something sinister was brewing beneath the surface of these seemingly unrelated crimes.
