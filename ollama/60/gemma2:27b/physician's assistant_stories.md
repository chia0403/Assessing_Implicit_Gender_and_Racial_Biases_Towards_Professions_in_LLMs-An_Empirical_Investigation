Rain lashed against the windowpanes of the makeshift clinic, mimicking the chaotic rhythm thrumming in Elara Ramirez's chest. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant, antiseptic, and something else, something acrid – fear.  Outside, Hurricane Celeste raged, churning the turquoise waters of the Caribbean into a frothing maelstrom.

Elara pressed her palm against the cool glass, squinting through the torrential downpour at the battered fishing village nestled precariously on the coast. It had been two days since Celeste made landfall, and the storm's fury showed no signs of abating.  The clinic, a single-story building hastily converted from an abandoned schoolhouse, was their only lifeline now, overflowing with the injured and the terrified.

A cough, wet and hacking, tore Elara from her contemplation. A young boy, his face pale and drawn beneath a tangled mess of dark curls, clutched at his mother's hand. His breaths came in shallow gasps, his chest heaving. Elara knew what it was before he even spoke – pneumonia, likely exacerbated by the damp, cold conditions.  She turned back to her meager supplies, a knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. Celeste had cut off all communication with the mainland, leaving them isolated and vulnerable.

Elara Ramirez, seasoned physician assistant and daughter of the sea, was facing her greatest challenge yet.
