The midday sun beat down on the dusty courtyard, reflecting off the polished granite slabs stacked neatly against the walls. Sweat stung Elias Thorne's eyes as he chipped away at a block of rough-hewn limestone, his hammer ringing out like a defiant bell against the rhythmic clanging of other craftsmen in the stone yard. The air hung thick with the smell of dust and sweat, punctuated by the occasional tang of copper from the nearby coppersmith.

Elias, a broad-shouldered man with calloused hands and a stoic face etched with years of toil, paused momentarily to wipe his brow with a worn rag. He squinted at his work, studying the emerging shape of a gargoyle intended for the cathedral's new wing. It was a challenging commission, demanding both technical skill and artistic vision, something Elias prided himself on possessing in equal measure.

But today, a restlessness gnawed at him, an unsettling premonition that lingered beneath the surface of his routine. He couldn't shake the feeling that something momentous was about to happen, something that would irrevocably alter the course of his life.
