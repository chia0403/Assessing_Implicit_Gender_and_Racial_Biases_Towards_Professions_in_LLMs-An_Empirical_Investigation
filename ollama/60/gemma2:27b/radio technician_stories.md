Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the abandoned lighthouse, each drop an echoing hammer blow on Elias Finch's already frayed nerves. He hunched over his workbench, the flickering light from a kerosene lamp casting long, dancing shadows across the cluttered space.  Wires, transistors, and vacuum tubes lay scattered around him like discarded bones, testament to hours spent trying to coax a signal out of the ancient radio receiver he held in his calloused hands.

Elias was no stranger to isolation. For years, he'd roamed the desolate coastal towns of Maine, patching up broken radios for fishermen and lighthouse keepers, content in the quiet hum of static and the crackle of distant voices. But this job was different. This wasnâ€™t a simple repair; it was a hunt. The signal Elias sought was rumored to be ghostly, faint whispers from beyond the grave, echoing across the airwaves from a long-lost shipwreck.

The lighthouse, perched precariously on the edge of a windswept cliff, seemed to lean towards the churning sea below, as if yearning for the waves that had claimed its former keeper decades ago. Elias shivered, not entirely from the cold. He could feel the weight of history pressing down on him, a sense of unseen eyes watching his every move.
