The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Edgar Bartholomew Thistlewick III as he pushed his battered janitorial cart down the echoing hallway of the Grand Blackwood Museum. Dust motes danced in the sickly yellow light, swirling like miniature tornadoes around Edgar's ankles. The air hung heavy with the scent of beeswax and ancient parchment, a peculiar mix that Edgar had come to associate with both comfort and quiet desperation.

He paused before a towering display case housing a fossilized skeleton of a prehistoric creature Edgar couldn't quite recall the name of â€“ something with too many teeth and an unsettlingly vacant stare. He sighed, wiping a smear of coffee from his faded denim overalls. Another night, another endless parade of artifacts whispering secrets he couldn't decipher.

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Edgar's spine as he rounded the corner into the Egyptian exhibit. The usually serene tableau of sarcophagi and hieroglyphics seemed to pulsate with an unseen energy. As he reached for his mop, a faint whisper grazed his ear, a sound like dry leaves rustling in a forgotten tomb.

Edgar froze, his heart hammering against his ribs. He wasn't alone.
