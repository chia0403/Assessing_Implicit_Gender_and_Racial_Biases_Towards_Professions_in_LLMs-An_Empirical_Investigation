The air hung thick with the scent of pine needles and damp earth, a familiar perfume that clung to Elijah Blackwood like a second skin.  Sunlight, filtered through the towering canopy of Douglas firs, painted dappled patterns on the forest floor as he surveyed the scene before him. A behemoth of a fir, its trunk thicker than any man Elijah had ever known, lay sprawled across the ground, felled by his expert hand just minutes ago. The echoing silence that followed the crashing blow was a testament to the sheer size and age of the fallen giant.  

Elijah, calloused hands resting on his hips, felt a pang of respect for the tree even as he planned its dissection. He'd spent his entire life in these woods, following in the footsteps of his father and grandfather before him. The rhythm of the saw, the scent of sawdust, the creak of ancient timber - they were all woven into the fabric of his being. But today felt different. There was a tension in the air, a whisper on the wind that spoke of change.
