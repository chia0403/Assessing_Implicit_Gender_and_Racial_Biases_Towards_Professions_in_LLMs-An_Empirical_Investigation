The air hung thick with the coppery scent of blood and cloves. Bartholomew "Bart" Grimbly wiped his brow with the back of his stained apron, the worn cotton rough against his skin. Dawn was barely breaking, painting the sky in bruised hues of purple and orange, but Bart's day had already begun hours ago. The cobblestone streets outside were still damp from the night's rain, reflecting the dim glow of the oil lamps that lined the narrow alleyway leading to Grimbly's Butcher Shop. 

Bart hefted a glistening haunch of venison onto the butcher block, its ruby flesh catching the weak light filtering through the shop window. He ran a calloused thumb across the smooth muscle, a practiced eye assessing its quality. Today was market day, and Bart had to be ready. The townsfolk relied on him for their meat, their sausages, their stews. He prided himself on providing the freshest cuts, knowing each family's preferences like his own - Mrs. Hathaway's love of lamb chops, young Thomas's insatiable appetite for liver, old Mr. Finch's insistence on only the finest beefsteak. But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Bart's spine, a sense that the day held more than just the usual rhythm of buying and selling.
