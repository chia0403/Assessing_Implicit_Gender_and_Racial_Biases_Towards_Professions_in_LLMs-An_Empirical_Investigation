Rain lashed against the dusty windows of "Critter Care," blurring the neon sign that flickered erratically. Inside, Dr. Evelyn Sinclair sighed, her reflection wavering in the rain-streaked glass. The clinic was quiet tonight, unusually so for a Friday.  Even Gus, the ginger tabby who usually ruled the waiting room with an iron paw and a haughty purr, was nowhere to be seen. 

Evelyn ran a hand through her auburn braid, exhaustion tugging at her eyelids. It had been a long week: a frantic search for a lost parrot, emergency surgery on a terrier with a swallowed sock, and endless rounds of vaccinations and deworming.  She longed for the simple comfort of her own couch, a steaming cup of tea, and a good book. 

But just as she was about to shut down the clinic early, a frantic pounding on the door shattered the silence. Evelyn turned, heart sinking, knowing that whatever awaited her wouldn't be a simple case of fleas or a sniffle. The storm raged outside, mirroring the unease brewing within her.
