The scent of damp earth and decaying leaves clung to Elias Finch like a second skin.  He inhaled deeply, relishing the earthy aroma as he pushed his rusty wheelbarrow along the winding path. Sunlight filtered through the ancient oak canopy overhead, dappling the mossy ground in emerald patches.

This was Elias's domain - Blackwood Manor Gardens. For forty years, he had tended to the sprawling grounds, coaxing life from the soil and sculpting the wilderness into a symphony of blooms. Each rose bush, each meticulously pruned topiary, each cobblestone path spoke of his quiet dedication.

But today, something felt different. A subtle tension hummed beneath the usual tranquility. Perhaps it was the crows congregating in unsettling numbers on the ancient yew tree, their caws echoing like morbid laughter. Or maybe it was the unsettling silence from the manor itself, a hulking silhouette against the graying sky, devoid of its usual bustling energy.


Elias tightened his grip on the barrow handle, a knot forming in his gut. Something was amiss.  He pushed forward, drawn by an invisible force towards the heart of Blackwood Manor and whatever secrets it held.
