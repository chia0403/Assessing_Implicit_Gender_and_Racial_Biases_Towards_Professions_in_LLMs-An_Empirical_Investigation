The ornate gold clock above the grand fireplace chimed twice, its dulcet tones barely cutting through the incessant hum of the air conditioning unit that struggled valiantly against the oppressive August heat. Elodie Beaumont, her meticulously styled auburn hair pulled back into an elegant chignon, adjusted the velvet sash around her emerald green dress. The fabric felt strangely stiff, a stark contrast to the humid air clinging to her skin. 

Elodie surveyed the lobby of the Grand Palais Hotel with a practiced eye. Crystal chandeliers shimmered under the vaulted ceiling, casting dancing rainbows on the polished marble floor. A lone guest, dressed in a rumpled linen suit, slumped on a plush chaise longue, his face buried in a travel guide. Elodie knew better than to interrupt; the man was likely suffering from jet lag and needed his space. 

Her gaze settled on the ornate double doors leading into the opulent ballroom. Tonight, the Grand Palais was hosting its annual Midsummer Masquerade Ball – an event steeped in tradition and extravagance. As the hotel's head concierge, Elodie was responsible for ensuring every detail went off without a hitch, from orchestrating the arrival of dignitaries to discreetly managing any unforeseen hiccups.

Tonight, however, a gnawing sense of unease tugged at her. A cryptic message left on her desk earlier that day – “The masquerade hides more than faces” – had unnerved her. Who sent it? And what did they mean? Elodie pushed the unsettling thought aside, reminding herself to focus on the task at hand. The Grand Palais awaited its guests.
