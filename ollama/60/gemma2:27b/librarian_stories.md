Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Grand Blackwood Library, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the ancient cobblestones outside. The scent of damp paper and leather filled the air, mingling with the faint aroma of cinnamon from Eleanor Ainsworth's chamomile tea, steeping forgotten on her desk. 

Eleanor, a woman whose silver hair was as neatly arranged as the Dewey Decimal system she revered, peered over her spectacles at the storm raging beyond the stained glass. She hadn't expected anyone to brave the tempestuous night, yet a figure now stood hesitantly in the doorway, backlit by the flickering gaslight on the street corner. A young man, his coat dripping and hair plastered to his forehead, clutched a battered leather satchel. Eleanor straightened her cardigan and placed her bookmark into "The Canterbury Tales," its worn pages whispering secrets of a forgotten age.

"Welcome to the Grand Blackwood Library," she said, her voice as soothing as the rain against the pane. "How may I assist you on this stormy evening?"
