Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Archibald "Archie" Finch's workshop, each drop a tiny hammer blow echoing through the cluttered space. The air hung thick with the scent of solder and mildew, punctuated by the sharp tang of bleach Archie used to disinfect his tools.  Outside, the gutters overflowed, sending torrents of muddy water cascading down the cobblestone alley behind his shop in the industrial heart of Birmingham. 

Archie wiped grime from his brow with a calloused hand, the wrinkles around his eyes deepening as he squinted at the dripping pipe in front of him. It wasn't supposed to be this difficult. A simple leak fix for Mrs. Higgins down on Ashwood Street should have been a breeze, an easy job to squeeze in before lunch. Yet here he was, wrestling with a stubborn fitting that refused to budge, frustration gnawing at his gut like the persistent Birmingham drizzle.

The door creaked open, sending a gust of wind and damp air swirling through the workshop. A figure stood silhouetted against the grey light, their features obscured by the downpour. Archie straightened up, wiping his hands on his oil-stained apron, and braced himself for whatever new problem the relentless storm had washed in.
