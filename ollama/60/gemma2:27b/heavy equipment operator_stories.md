The sun beat down on Elijah "Eli" Blackwood's neck, turning the collar of his grease-stained shirt damp with sweat. He squinted through the haze rising from the cracked asphalt of the abandoned quarry, the hulking Caterpillar excavator he piloted groaning and sighing as it scooped up another load of rubble. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking Eli's attempts to stay cool.

This wasn't exactly the life he’d pictured for himself when he graduated high school with honors. He'd dreamed of engineering, maybe even architecture, but a family emergency had forced him to take a job at Blackwood Construction, his father’s struggling business. Now, instead of designing bridges, Eli spent his days tearing them down.

The quarry was a desolate place, scarred by years of excavation and echoing with the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead. It felt like a forgotten corner of the world, swallowed by the relentless sun and choked by dust. Yet, there was a certain grim satisfaction in the work. Every load Eli hauled away was another step towards clearing the land, a blank slate for something new to rise. 

Today's job, however, felt different. He sensed it the moment his father called him over, his face etched with a worry Eli hadn't seen before. "Eli," he said, his voice raspy, "We got a problem." The words hung in the air like dust particles, foretelling trouble brewing beneath the surface.
