Rain lashed against the warped windowpanes of Dr. Amelia "Amy" Croft's clinic, mirroring the storm brewing within her. The flickering gas lamp cast long shadows on the threadbare rug and the shelves overflowing with dusty medical texts. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping the muddy streets of Grimsborough into a frenzy. It was a night for staying indoors, huddled by a roaring fire, not for venturing out into the gloom. Yet, Amy knew there would be no respite for her tonight.

The insistent rapping at her door confirmed it. She rose from her worn armchair, smoothing down her simple grey dress and bracing herself for whatever calamity awaited. Grimsborough was a town steeped in shadows and whispers, where illness often walked hand-in-hand with misfortune.  She took a deep breath, the scent of lavender oil and old parchment filling her nostrils, and crossed to the door, ready to face the storm outside â€“ and within.
