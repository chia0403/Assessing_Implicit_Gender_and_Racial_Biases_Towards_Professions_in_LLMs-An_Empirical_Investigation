The sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's weathered neck, turning his already tanned skin a shade darker. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling red dirt across the vast expanse of his Texas ranch. He adjusted the brim of his Stetson and squinted at the horizon, searching for any sign of movement from his cattle herd. The silence was broken only by the buzz of cicadas and the occasional mournful cry of a hawk circling overhead. Silas had been tending these lands for over forty years, his life a tapestry woven from sweat, grit, and the unwavering rhythm of the seasons. But lately, a disquiet had settled upon him, a feeling as unfamiliar and unsettling as a sudden hailstorm in summer.

His gut told him something was amiss. The cattle were restless, their usual grazing patterns disrupted. The creek, usually brimming with life, flowed sluggishly, its banks cracked and dry. Even the wind seemed to whisper warnings through the mesquite trees.
