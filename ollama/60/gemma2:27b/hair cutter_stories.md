The air in "Curl Up & Dye" hung thick with the scent of jasmine shampoo and anticipation.  Outside, rain lashed against the storefront window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an impressionistic smear. Inside, Emilia Rose, with her fiery red curls mirroring the shop's name, expertly maneuvered scissors through a client's tangled mane. 

Emilia loved this moment, the quiet focus as she transformed unruly strands into works of art. Each snip was precise, each twist and pull deliberate.  Today, however, her usual calm was ruffled. A stranger sat in her waiting area, shrouded in shadow from his wide-brimmed hat. His eyes, sharp and watchful like a hawk's, seemed to follow Emilia's every move.  He hadn't booked an appointment, but simply walked in off the rain-soaked street, a shiver trailing him despite the shop's warm glow. Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that this man, with his air of quiet menace, was about to change everything.
