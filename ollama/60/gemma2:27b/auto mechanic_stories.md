The air in "Grease Monkey's Garage" hung heavy with the scent of motor oil, burnt rubber, and desperation. Outside, the sun beat down on the cracked asphalt lot in Dustbowl, Nevada, a town so forgotten even tumbleweeds seemed to avoid it. 

Inside, Silas Montgomery "Monty" Greer wiped grease from his brow with a rag already saturated with grime.  His knuckles were scarred, his hands calloused – badges of honor earned over years spent coaxing life back into battered engines. Today, though, the engine he faced wasn't cooperating. A '67 Mustang, cherry red and once proud, now sat hunched on the lift like a wounded animal. Monty swore under his breath, tightening a bolt with frustration. This car was supposed to be his ticket out of Dustbowl – a chance to win the annual "Gear Grinder" race and finally leave this ghost town behind.
