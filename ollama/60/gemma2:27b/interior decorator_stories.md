The late afternoon sun sliced through the dusty windows of the abandoned bakery, illuminating motes dancing in the stale air. Eliza Beatrice Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up the bridge of her nose. Flour-dusted beams sagged precariously overhead, and cobwebs draped every corner like macabre tinsel.  It wasn't exactly the chic Parisian loft she envisioned herself transforming, but Eliza had a knack for seeing potential in the most unexpected places.

This crumbling relic of a bakery, tucked away on a forgotten side street in downtown Savannah, Georgia, was her latest challenge. The air hung heavy with the ghosts of sugared pastries and yeasty bread, whispering tales of a bygone era. Eliza inhaled deeply, trying to discern if it was nostalgia she smelled or just mildew. Either way, beneath the grime and decay, she sensed something waiting to be reborn.
