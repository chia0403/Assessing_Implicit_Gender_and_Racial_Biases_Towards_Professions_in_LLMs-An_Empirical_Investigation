Rain lashed against the dusty windowpane of Bartholomew “Bart” Finnegan’s office, mimicking the relentless pounding in his head.  The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and despair. Bart, a man whose once-sharp suits now bore the wrinkles of countless disappointments, stared at the cracked ceiling, contemplating the irony of selling peace of mind when his own life felt like a never-ending insurance claim.

His office, tucked away in a dilapidated building on Elm Street, was a testament to his dwindling fortunes.  The chipped Formica desk held mountains of paperwork, each file representing another broken promise, another dream deferred. Outside, the city of Newhaven thrummed with life, oblivious to Bart's quiet desperation. 

But today was different. Today, a glimmer of hope had flickered through the gloom - a lead on a potential client who could turn his fortunes around.  A wealthy recluse named Alistair Blackwood, rumored to possess an eccentric collection of priceless artifacts, needed insurance for… something. Bart didn't know the details yet, but the sheer size of Blackwood's supposed fortune was enough to stir something long dormant within him - ambition.
