Rain hammered against Silas Montgomery's hard hat, each drop an icy fist pounding on his skull. He hunched further into the meager shelter provided by the chimney stack, wind whipping his threadbare work jacket around him like a scarecrow in a gale. Below, the city sprawled in a gray, rain-soaked expanse. Brick and concrete blurred through the downpour, punctuated by flashes of neon from shops still stubbornly clinging to life. Silas wasn't sure what day it was anymore. Time had become as fluid as the water cascading off the slate roof he was supposed to be fixing.

He peered over the edge, his stomach churning at the sight of the dizzying drop. The wind howled again, threatening to rip him from his precarious perch. He gripped the rusty ladder tighter, nails digging into the calloused skin of his palms. This job was a nightmare, but Silas needed the money. Badly.
