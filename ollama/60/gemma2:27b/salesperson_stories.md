Rain lashed against the dusty storefront window, blurring the neon "Open" sign into an indecipherable smear. Inside, Amelia Cartwright chewed on her thumbnail, anxiety twisting in her gut.  She'd been standing at the front counter of "Curios & Curiosities" for nearly two hours, the silence broken only by the rhythmic tick of a grandfather clock and the occasional groan from the aging building. 

Amelia wasn't meant for quaint antique shops nestled in sleepy seaside towns. She belonged amongst the slick skyscrapers and bustling crowds of London, where ambition thrived and deals were struck with a handshake and a wink. Yet, here she was, exiled to her grandmother's dusty shop after a particularly disastrous sales pitch landed her on probation.  

Today was the last chance. Her grandmother, bless her heart, had agreed to let Amelia sell off some of the more "questionable" items in the back room - a collection of oddities that ranged from shrunken heads and antique medical instruments to what Amelia suspected was a cursed Egyptian amulet. If she couldn't make a single sale today, Amelia knew she'd be facing her grandmother's disappointed frown and a one-way ticket back to London.
