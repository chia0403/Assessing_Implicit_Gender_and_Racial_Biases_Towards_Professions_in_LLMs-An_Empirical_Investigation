Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the abandoned warehouse, mirroring the storm raging inside Eleanor Vance.  She ran a hand through her already disheveled dark curls, frustration twisting her features. The cavernous space, once a bustling hub for textile production, now echoed with emptiness – much like her latest project.

Eleanor Vance, known in the industry as "Ellie," was a visionary director on the cusp of greatness. Her debut feature, a gritty psychological thriller, had garnered critical acclaim and a cult following. But this follow-up, a sweeping historical epic set during the French Revolution, felt cursed from the start. Funding had dried up, her lead actor had walked off set citing "creative differences," and the script seemed to be unraveling faster than the frayed rope hanging from the ceiling.

As thunder cracked overhead, Ellie stared at the storyboard spread across a rickety table –  a tapestry of sketched scenes depicting Parisian cobblestone streets, opulent ballrooms, and the bloody chaos of guillotine executions. The images, once vibrant with possibility, now seemed faded and lifeless, like ghosts haunting a forgotten past.
