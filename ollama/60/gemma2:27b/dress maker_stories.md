The air hung thick with the scent of lavender and beeswax in Eloise Beaumont’s atelier. Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing above racks overflowing with bolts of silk, velvet, and brocade. Eloise, her fingers nimbly threading a needle through emerald satin, paused to listen to the rhythmic clatter of the tram outside. 

It was 1908, and Paris pulsed with a frenetic energy. The city seemed to be on the cusp of something extraordinary, a change brewing in the very air she breathed. Eloise herself felt it – a yearning for more than the meticulously crafted gowns she draped upon the wealthy socialites of the Faubourg Saint-Germain. She longed to create designs that spoke not only of elegance but also of freedom, of a woman’s burgeoning power in a world still dominated by men.

Today, however, Eloise had a rather tedious commission on her worktable: a corseted ballgown for Madame Dupont, a woman known more for her social ambition than her sartorial sense. Eloise sighed, longing for the thrill of designing something truly innovative, something that would make her mark on the world beyond the confines of her atelier.
