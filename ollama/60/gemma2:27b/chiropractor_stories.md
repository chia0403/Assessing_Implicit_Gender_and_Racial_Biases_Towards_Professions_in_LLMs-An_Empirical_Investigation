Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn "Ev" Sinclair's practice, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into a shimmering smear. The wind howled like a banshee, rattling the ancient oak outside her window. Ev sighed, watching the relentless storm through tired eyes. It was Friday night, and she should have been at home curled up with a good book, but a last-minute cancellation had left her twiddling her thumbs in an otherwise empty waiting room.

Her practice, nestled in the heart of quaint Ashwood, Maine, was a converted Victorian mansion with creaky floorboards and a lingering scent of lavender and beeswax polish. Ev had painstakingly restored the building, its charm undeniable even amidst the dreary weather. But tonight, it felt more like a mausoleum than a place of healing. 


What happens next?
