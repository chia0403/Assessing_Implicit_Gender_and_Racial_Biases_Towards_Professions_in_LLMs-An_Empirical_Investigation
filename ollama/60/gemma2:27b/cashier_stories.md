The fluorescent lights hummed above Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the endless stream of groceries sliding across her conveyor belt. The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and something vaguely meaty, a testament to the countless packages of chicken breasts sheâ€™d scanned that afternoon. Outside, a relentless summer rain lashed against the windows of the Save-Rite supermarket, blurring the world into an Impressionist painting of grey and green. Evelyn sighed, her shoulders slumping under the weight of another monotonous shift. She dreamed of escaping this beige purgatory, of trading in the endless beep of the scanner for the melody of a saxophone, the clink of coins for the applause of a cheering crowd.  But for now, she was stuck, scanning cans of soup and listening to Mrs. Henderson's latest woes about her arthritic knee.
