The incessant whine of the fluorescent lights above grated on Alistair Finch's nerves. He tugged at his collar, already sticky with sweat despite the arctic blast of the AC unit struggling valiantly against the August heat. The air hung heavy in the abandoned warehouse, thick with dust motes dancing in the sickly yellow glow. 

Alistair knelt beside a panel box, its rusted metal groaning under his weight. He ran a calloused thumb over a frayed wire, wincing at the spark that jumped between his finger and the exposed copper. This place was a death trap, a tangle of outdated wiring begging for a catastrophic surge. But Alistair needed the work. His rent was due, and his daughter's ballet recital loomed on the horizon. 

He flicked the switch beside him, plunging the already dim space into deeper shadows.  Suddenly, a sharp clang echoed through the cavernous building. Alistair froze, his heart hammering against his ribs. He wasn't alone.
