Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Finch's tiny studio apartment, blurring the already indistinct neon glow of the city outside. The air hung thick with the scent of instant ramen and stale coffee, a familiar perfume in Elias' world. He hunched over his keyboard, fingers flying across the keys as he wrestled with a particularly stubborn line of code. His screen pulsed with emerald green text, a digital battlefield where lines of logic clashed against unforeseen errors.

The details were sparse - build a secure platform capable of handling vast amounts of encrypted data - but the compensation was generous enough to silence Elias' nagging curiosity.

He paused, staring at the flickering cursor on his screen, feeling a prickling unease he couldn't explain. Was it just the storm playing tricks on him? Or was there something more sinister lurking within the depths of this project?
