The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty window of Beatrice Rosalind Finch's cluttered office, illuminating motes of dust that danced like miniature ballerinas in the air. The air itself was thick with the scent of old paper and forgotten coffee, a fragrance Beatrice had come to associate with both comfort and impending doom. Stacks of manuscripts threatened to topple from her desk, each one a potential world waiting to be unleashed â€“ or, more often than not, politely rejected. 

Today, however, a different kind of tension crackled in the air. A manila envelope lay open on Beatrice's desk, its contents promising something altogether extraordinary.  A single sheet of paper held a manuscript unlike any she had ever encountered before: words scrawled in a spidery hand, hinting at secrets buried deep within the forgotten corners of history. The title, boldly underlined, sent a shiver down her spine: "The Chronicle of the Obsidian Mirror".
