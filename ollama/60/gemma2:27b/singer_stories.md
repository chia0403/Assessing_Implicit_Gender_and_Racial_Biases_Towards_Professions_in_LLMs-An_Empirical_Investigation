The smoky haze hung heavy in the air of The Blue Moon Saloon, clinging to Amelia "Ember" Rose's crimson dress like a second skin.  She adjusted the microphone stand, her calloused fingers tracing the worn metal. The scent of stale beer and sweat mingled with the faint aroma of jasmine from her perfume - a jarring contrast that somehow fit perfectly in this dimly lit, ramshackle haven for music lovers and dreamers. 

Ember inhaled deeply, steeling herself against the familiar pre-show jitters.  Tonight was different. Tonight, she wasn't just singing for tips; tonight, a talent scout from Nashville was in the audience, his keen eyes scanning the crowd like a hawk. This was her chance, the one shot at escaping the dusty backroads of her hometown and chasing the glimmering dream that had been burning within her since childhood.
