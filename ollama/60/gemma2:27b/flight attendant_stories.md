The recycled air hummed with a dull throb, barely masking the insistent ping of the fasten seatbelt sign. Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz tightened her smile as she navigated the aisle, dodging overflowing carry-ons and fidgeting passengers. Her heels clicked against the worn carpet, a rhythmic counterpoint to the symphony of coughs, whispered conversations, and rustling newspapers. Outside, the Boeing 747 sliced through a tapestry of bruised purple clouds, the setting sun painting the horizon in fiery hues. Esme was heading back to her home base, Miami, after a long transatlantic flight from London.

But tonight felt different. A prickling unease danced beneath her skin, a feeling she couldn't quite shake off. Perhaps it was the passenger in seat 17A, who had been staring intently at her ever since boarding, his gaze unsettlingly focused. Or maybe it was the cryptic message scribbled on a napkin and left tucked under the safety card of the empty seat beside him: "The sky hides secrets."
