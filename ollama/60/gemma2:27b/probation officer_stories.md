Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Evelyn Carmichael's office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her.  Stacks of files teetered precariously on her desk, each one representing another life dangling in the balance – lives she was tasked with guiding back from the precipice. Outside, the neon signs of downtown Detroit blurred through the downpour, a stark contrast to the sterile beige walls and flickering fluorescent lights of the Probation Department. Evelyn sighed, her breath fogging the glass pane separating her cubicle from the waiting area.

Today's appointment, a young man named Marcus Jenkins convicted on petty theft charges, was proving particularly difficult. His file lay open before her, filled with red flags: previous arrests, unstable family life, and a history of substance abuse. Evelyn wasn't sure if she could reach him, if the system itself could offer him anything but another fleeting chance at redemption.  She glanced at the clock – 3:45 pm. Marcus was already fifteen minutes late.
