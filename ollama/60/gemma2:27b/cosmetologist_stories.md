The humid Charleston air clung to Eloise Evangeline Dupree like a second skin as she navigated the cobblestone streets towards her salon, "Eloise's Elegance." Bougainvillea spilled over wrought iron balconies, their vibrant fuchsia blooms mirroring the fiery streaks in Eloise's own auburn hair.  She hummed along to a bluesy tune crackling on her ancient iPod, her fingers already itching to work their magic. Today was prom day, and Eloise lived for these moments - transforming nervous teenagers into confident young adults, each strand of hair a brushstroke in her masterpiece. But today felt different. A prickle of unease danced beneath Eloise's usual bubbly enthusiasm. 


She paused at the arched doorway of her salon, catching a glimpse of herself reflected in the dusty windowpane. Her emerald eyes, usually sparkling with mischief, held a hint of apprehension. Maybe it was just the humidity, she thought, pushing open the heavy wooden door. Or maybe, just maybe, there was something more brewing beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary Charleston day.
