The August sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat dripped from his brow, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with a stubborn beam, its weight threatening to send him sprawling onto the dusty plywood floor.  

Eli was used to hard work. Heâ€™d spent the last decade building everything from skyscrapers in Chicago to quaint summer homes on Cape Cod. But this project, renovating an old Victorian mansion overlooking the craggy Maine coastline, was proving to be a different beast altogether. The house, with its warped floorboards, hidden drafts, and mysterious creaks, seemed to resist his efforts at every turn. 

Today's challenge: coaxing a hundred-year-old window frame back into place. It had been painstakingly removed by Eli's predecessor, a gruff old timer who swore the house was haunted. Eli scoffed at the idea then, but as he struggled with the warped wood, the oppressive silence of the empty rooms, broken only by the distant cries of gulls and the rhythmic thud of his hammer, began to gnaw at him.
