Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor "Ellie" Beaumont's classroom, mimicking the relentless drumming in her chest. Her third-grade students were abuzz with excitement for Halloween tomorrow, their anticipation almost tangible. But Ellie couldn't focus on the sugar skull masks and crayon bat drawings adorning the bulletin board. 

Her classroom, usually a vibrant haven of learning nestled in the heart of Elmwood Elementary, felt claustrophobic today. The old oak tree outside her window, normally a comforting presence with its leaves rustling secrets in the breeze, now loomed like a skeletal giant against the stormy sky. A shiver ran down Ellie's spine, unrelated to the chill in the air.

Something was wrong. Terribly wrong.
