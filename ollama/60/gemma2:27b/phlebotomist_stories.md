Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Mercy General Hospital, blurring the already dim streetlights into smudges of yellow. Inside, the fluorescent lights hummed an unceasing melody, casting a sickly pallor over everything. Elara Ramirez, her nametag clipped precariously to her starched white uniform, sighed as she surveyed the near-empty waiting room. The only occupant was a gaunt man hunched in a corner, his face obscured by a newspaper held too close to his eyes.

Elara, despite her years of experience drawing blood, still found herself tense before each patient. Today's schedule promised to be particularly taxing: a pediatric ward check-up followed by a series of geriatric patients with notoriously difficult veins. She tightened the elastic band on her wrist, the familiar pressure grounding her. It was just another day at Mercy General â€“ a place where hope and despair intertwined like tangled threads.
