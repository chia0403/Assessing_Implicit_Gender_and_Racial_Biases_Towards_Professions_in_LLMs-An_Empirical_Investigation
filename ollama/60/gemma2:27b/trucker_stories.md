Rain lashed against the windshield of Bartholomew "Bart" Callahan's rig, blurring the already fading neon signs that dotted the desolate stretch of I-80. The Wyoming sky was a bruised purple, heavy with the promise of more downpour. Bart sighed, his reflection in the rearview mirror a tired, grizzled man with eyes as weary as the road he traveled. He'd been hauling double-stacked containers from Denver to Chicago for three days straight, fueled by black coffee and the steady drone of the engine. The incessant drumming of the rain on the roof was starting to sound like a mournful heartbeat.

He needed a break, but there wasn't a truck stop in sight for miles. Just endless prairie punctuated by the occasional skeletal windmill groaning against the wind. Bart reached for his CB radio, hoping to catch someone else on the airwaves, maybe find out about road closures or even just hear another voice besides the static and the hum of his own engine.
