Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Beatrice "Bea" Haverford's cramped office, mirroring the turmoil brewing within her. The flickering fluorescent light cast long shadows across stacks of crumpled W-2s and receipts, each one representing another soul seeking refuge from the labyrinthine world of income tax. April 15th loomed like a guillotine, its blade sharp and unforgiving.

Bea sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Her office, nestled precariously above a noisy Chinese takeout joint in the heart of Brooklyn, was far from glamorous. The scent of chili oil and garlic perpetually wafted through the air vents, mingling with the stale smell of coffee and desperation. But it was hers. A tiny haven carved out from the chaos, where she could wield her calculator like a sword and slay the monstrous dragon of tax returns.
