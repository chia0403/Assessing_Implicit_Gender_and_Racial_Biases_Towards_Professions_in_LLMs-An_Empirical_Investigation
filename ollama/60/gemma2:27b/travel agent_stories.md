Rain lashed against the windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Paradise Found Travel" sign hanging outside Amelia Cartwright's cramped office. It was always busier in dreary weather, people dreaming of sunnier climates while huddled under grey skies. Amelia sighed, pushing aside a pile of glossy brochures advertising tropical getaways and European adventures. Today, though, even paradise seemed out of reach. The phone hadn't rung once all morning, and her usual caffeine-fueled energy was replaced by a gnawing anxiety.

Her landlord had left a note on her door yesterday, reminding her that rent was due in three days. Three days she didn't have the funds for. Her savings were dwindling faster than the number of tourists visiting exotic locales these days. The travel industry, once vibrant and bustling, felt like it was slowly shrinking, swallowed by the ever-growing shadow of online booking platforms.

Amelia chewed on her lip, staring at a framed photograph on her desk - a sun-drenched beach with turquoise waters and swaying palm trees. It was from her honeymoon to Bali, a trip she meticulously planned herself, back when "Paradise Found Travel" was just a dream in her heart. Now, the picture served as a painful reminder of what she stood to lose.

Suddenly, a sharp rap on the door startled Amelia from her thoughts. A tall figure cloaked in a dark, rain-soaked trench coat stood on her doorstep, his face obscured by the shadows of his wide-brimmed hat. He held a worn leather suitcase clutched tightly in his hand. "Amelia Cartwright?" His voice was gravelly and low, carrying an unmistakable air of urgency.
