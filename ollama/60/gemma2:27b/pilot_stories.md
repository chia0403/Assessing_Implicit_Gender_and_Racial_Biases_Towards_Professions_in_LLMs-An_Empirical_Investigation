The cockpit reeked faintly of stale coffee and burnt ozone â€“ a scent Amelia Sinclair knew intimately. Outside, the Arizona desert stretched out beneath her, an undulating canvas of ochre and rust. The sun beat down mercilessly, turning the landscape into a shimmering mirage. Amelia squinted through the glare, adjusting the controls of her Cessna 172 as it bucked slightly in the dry, hot air.

Today's mission wasn't glamorous: aerial survey for a pipeline company. But Amelia loved the freedom of flight, the way the world shrunk beneath her wings, problems and deadlines fading into insignificance. She was happiest when she was airborne, a solitary bird soaring above the mundane.
