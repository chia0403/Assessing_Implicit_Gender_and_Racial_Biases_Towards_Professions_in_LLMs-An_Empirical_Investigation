The aroma of burnt sugar hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of yeast and cinnamon. Eloise Beaumont sighed, her fingers stained with flour and frustration. The batch of brioche she'd been working on all morning had gone disastrously wrong – too much heat, not enough patience, a recipe for disaster, literally.

The competition was fierce, and even with her grandmother's secret sourdough starter, Eloise felt like she was constantly playing catch-up.  Today, the pressure felt heavier than usual. A renowned food critic, rumored to be notoriously harsh, was visiting Montmartre.
