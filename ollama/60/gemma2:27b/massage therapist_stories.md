Rain hammered against the windows of Serenity Spa, mimicking the frantic drumming in Elara Nightingale's chest. The power flickered ominously, casting long shadows across the dimly lit waiting room. She glanced at the grandfather clock ticking away in the corner, its hands creeping towards six o'clock. It was her last appointment of the day, and she had a feeling it wouldn't be a pleasant one. 

Mr. Thorne. A name that conjured images of sharp angles, furrowed brows, and a voice like gravel scraping across pavement. He was known for being demanding and impatient, a man who expected his knots to vanish into thin air with the mere touch of her fingertips. Elara had tried everything to appease him in their previous sessions - deeper pressure, hot stones, even aromatherapy oils â€“ but nothing seemed to ease the tension that radiated off him like heat from a furnace. Tonight felt different though, heavier, charged with something she couldn't quite decipher. 

Taking a deep breath, Elara smoothed down her lavender-scented tunic and steeled herself for whatever Mr. Thorne had in store. As the power finally gave way with a guttural groan, plunging the spa into darkness, she knew this session wouldn't be just about unraveling muscle tension.  There was something else brewing in the shadows, something that felt unsettlingly familiar.
