The incessant hum of the city, a symphony of sirens, car horns, and distant construction clanging, was Amelia Blackwood's lullaby. From her tenth-floor apartment overlooking Chicago's vibrant Loop, she could practically taste the metallic tang of exhaust fumes and hear the guttural growl of the L train snaking its way through the cityscape. Tonight, however, the city felt strangely muted. A thick fog had rolled in, swallowing buildings whole and muffling even the most persistent honks. 

Amelia stared out at the ghostly apparition that was Chicago, her reflection superimposed on the swirling grey. She was sketching – a building she’d been commissioned to design, a sleek, sustainable skyscraper destined for the rapidly gentrifying West Loop. But her pencil hovered hesitantly over the page. Something felt off. The lines felt stiff, the angles too sharp. It lacked the soul, the organic heartbeat that defined her best work.

Frustrated, Amelia pushed the sketchbook away and turned to her window, gazing into the swirling abyss. Perhaps it was the fog, playing tricks on her vision, but she could have sworn she saw a flicker of light in the distance – a singular, pulsating beacon cutting through the grey. A strange compulsion seized her; she had to know what it was.
