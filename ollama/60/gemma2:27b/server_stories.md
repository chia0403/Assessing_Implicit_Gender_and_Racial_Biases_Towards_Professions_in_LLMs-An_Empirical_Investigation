Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Rusty Spigot, blurring the neon beer sign into an abstract swirl of red and green. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of stale cigarettes and fried food, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of plates and the guttural grumbling of regulars. Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont, her dark hair plastered to her forehead, navigated the crowded floor with practiced ease, a tray laden with steaming burgers and greasy fries balanced precariously in her hand. 

The Spigot wasn't much to look at, but it was Ellie's haven, a place where she knew every nook and cranny, every face etched into the worn leather booths. It was a world away from the sterile monotony of her tiny apartment above a laundromat, where silence reigned and loneliness echoed in the empty rooms.
