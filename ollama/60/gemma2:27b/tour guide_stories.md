The humid air hung thick in the cavernous cathedral, heavy with incense and centuries of whispered prayers. Elodie Beaumont, her dark braid snaking down her back beneath her crisp white linen shirt, adjusted her microphone. It was always a gamble speaking into this contraption amidst the echoing stone â€“ one minute you were clear as a bell, the next your voice vanished into the ether, swallowed by unseen gargoyles and whispering angels sculpted into the vaulted ceiling.

Elodie took a deep breath, her gaze sweeping over the faces of her assembled tour group: a gaggle of eager retirees, two honeymooners giggling shyly at the back, and a lone backpacker scribbling furiously in a notebook. This was her stage, this grand cathedral its backdrop. A lifetime spent in its hallowed halls had transformed Elodie from a curious child into a walking encyclopedia of its history. Every stone whispered secrets to her, every stained glass window told a story she could weave into tapestry for her listeners. 

Today, though, something felt different. An unsettling current hummed beneath the usual stillness of the cathedral. As Elodie launched into her carefully crafted spiel about the origins of the magnificent rose window, she couldn't shake the feeling that unseen eyes were watching them, hidden amongst the shadows cast by flickering candles.
