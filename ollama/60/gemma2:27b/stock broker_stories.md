The air in Bartholomew "Bart" Finnegan's office crackled with tension, thick as the cigar smoke curling from his mahogany ashtray. Outside, Manhattan pulsed with its usual frenetic energy – yellow cabs honking, sirens wailing, pedestrians weaving through the canyons of glass and steel. But inside Bart's corner suite on the 47th floor of the Morgan Stanley building, the world narrowed to the flickering numbers dancing across his five monitors.

Bart, a man whose tailored suits seemed sculpted onto his lean frame and whose icy blue eyes missed nothing, tapped a manicured finger against the glass table. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was plummeting, dragging down with it the carefully constructed house of cards Bart had built for his most prestigious client, Mrs. Vanderlyn. He needed to make a move, and fast, before her fortune – and his reputation – crumbled into dust.
