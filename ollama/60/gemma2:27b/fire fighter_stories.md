The air hung heavy with smoke and the acrid scent of burning plastic.  Flames danced ravenously against the night sky, licking at the skeletal remains of what was once a bustling apartment building.  Captain Amelia "Amy" Reyes coughed, her lungs protesting the onslaught of noxious fumes. Sweat beaded on her brow despite the chill November air. Her helmet light sliced through the darkness, illuminating the charred debris strewn across the street.

This wasn't Amy's first rodeo. She had seen fire consume homes and businesses countless times before. But something about this blaze felt different. The inferno roared with an unnatural intensity, fueled by a hidden source she couldn't quite pinpoint. Her gut churned with unease. This was no ordinary accident.
