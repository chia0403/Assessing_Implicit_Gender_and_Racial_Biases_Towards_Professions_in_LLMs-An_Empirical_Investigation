The air hung heavy with the scent of iron and blood, a perfume that clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Hemlock's worn leather apron like an unwelcome shadow. The rhythmic thud of cleavers against bone echoed through the cramped shop, punctuated by the guttural rasp of his practiced butchering song - an old lullaby passed down through generations of Hemlocks, said to calm both animal and man during the final act.  Barty, a mountain of a man with hands like knotted oak branches, worked with a methodical precision honed by years in this small shop nestled on the cobbled backstreets of Newhaven. The town itself was a place perpetually caught between twilight and dawn, where gas lamps struggled to illuminate the grime-coated walls and whispers of dark secrets clung to the damp alleyways.  

It was a Saturday morning, the sun struggling to pierce the perpetual gloom, when a figure entered the shop, casting a long, unsettling shadow across Barty's work.
