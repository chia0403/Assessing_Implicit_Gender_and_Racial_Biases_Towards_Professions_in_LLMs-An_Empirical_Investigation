The scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Bartholomew "Bart" Greenleaf. He inhaled deeply, savoring it like fine wine as he surveyed his domain â€“ Elmwood Cemetery.  A symphony of birdsong filled the twilight hours, competing with the rhythmic whirring of Bart's ancient mower. 

Elmwood wasn't just a place for the departed; for Bart, it was a sanctuary, a tapestry woven from centuries-old oak trees reaching towards the sky like gnarled fingers and moss-covered headstones whispering forgotten stories. He knew every plot, every inscription, every crooked tree branch that cast peculiar shadows across the manicured lawns.  

He was more than just a groundskeeper; he was Elmwood's guardian, its silent shepherd tending to the memories of those who had passed. But tonight, as Bart wheeled his mower towards the willow-lined path leading to the oldest section, a new story whispered on the wind. A chill ran down his spine, unsettling even in the twilight warmth.  Something felt different.
