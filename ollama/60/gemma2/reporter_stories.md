The air hung thick with the smell of salt and decaying fish as Beatrice "Bea" Evergreen hunched over her notepad, scribbling furiously. The docks of Port Blackwood were a cacophony of shouts, creaking masts, and gulls screaming overhead – a symphony of chaos that somehow felt comforting to Bea. She’d been raised on these docks, amidst the tangled nets and weathered faces, learning the rhythm of the sea before she could read. Now, as a reporter for The Blackwood Bulletin, she used that knowledge to weave stories from the very fabric of this bustling port town. 

Today's story was proving particularly difficult. The usually jovial fishermen had been tight-lipped all morning, their faces etched with worry. A storm had rolled in unexpectedly last night, fiercer than any they’d seen in years, and one boat hadn't returned. Bea knew the unspoken fear that gnawed at them – the sea was a fickle mistress, and sometimes, she demanded payment in blood. 


Bea adjusted her worn-out leather satchel, its weight heavy with notebooks and pencils, and took a deep breath of the salty air. This storm wasn’t just about missing fishermen; it felt like a crack in the foundation of Port Blackwood, a warning that something darker was stirring beneath the waves. She needed to find out what happened to the missing boat, and she suspected the answers lay hidden somewhere within the tangled web of secrets that bound this town together.
