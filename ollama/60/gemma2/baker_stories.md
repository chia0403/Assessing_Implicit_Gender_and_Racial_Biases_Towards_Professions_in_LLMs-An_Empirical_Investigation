The scent of caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, a warm blanket against the biting November chill that had settled over Oakhaven. Inside "Sugarplum Dreams," Amelia Rose Hawthorne kneaded dough with practiced hands, her brow furrowed in concentration as she tested the consistency.  

Oakhaven, nestled in the foothills of the Appalachians, was a town where life moved at a slower pace. Everyone knew everyone else, and generations of families had woven their stories into the very fabric of the cobbled streets and weathered brick buildings. Sugarplum Dreams, with its whimsical name and pastel-colored awning, had become as much a fixture in the town as the old clock tower that chimed every hour, its bell ringing out like a comforting metronome.
