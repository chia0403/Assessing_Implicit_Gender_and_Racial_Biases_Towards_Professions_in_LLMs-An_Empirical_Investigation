The sirens wailed, a mournful chorus echoing through the deserted streets just after midnight. Rain lashed against the windshield of the ambulance, blurring the neon signs of closed businesses into abstract streaks of color. Inside, Amelia Grace Harper, head EMT and self-proclaimed queen of chaotic calm, gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white against the worn leather. 

The call came in ten minutes ago - a possible cardiac arrest at the abandoned warehouse district on the city's edge. A place notorious for its illicit activity, its boarded-up windows like vacant eyes staring into the storm. Amelia knew it wasn’t going to be pretty.  She glanced at her partner, rookie EMT Ben Carter, his face pale under the flickering red and blue lights. 

“First time at the Warehouse District?” she asked, a hint of amusement in her voice. He swallowed hard, nodding mutely. “Don’t worry,” Amelia said, flashing him a reassuring smile. “Just another night at the office.” But even as she spoke, a knot of apprehension tightened in her stomach. The warehouse district held secrets, and tonight, it seemed, those secrets were about to spill out into the rain-soaked streets.
