The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst in Ms. Amelia Juniper's office.  Fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the worn floral wallpaper. Outside her window, the parking lot of Northgate High School buzzed with the chaotic energy of students rushing to class, their backpacks bouncing like oversized, colorful projectiles. 

Amelia pushed a stray strand of silver hair behind her ear and leaned back in her creaky swivel chair. Another Monday morning.  Another avalanche of existential crises, parental complaints, and academic woes waiting to be sorted through. She sighed, idly flipping through the pile of student files on her desk. Today's first appointment was with Jeremy Peterson, a junior wrestling champion grappling with an uncharacteristic slump in performance, and his increasingly concerned mother. 

Amelia knew this wouldn't be your typical "I can't focus" or "My parents won't let me join the football team" type of session. This one felt heavier, like a storm cloud gathering on the horizon.  She hoped Jeremy was ready to open up. Sometimes, even with years of experience, Ms. Amelia Juniper found herself feeling utterly unprepared for the weight of young lives landing in her lap.
