The humid Alabama air clung to Coach Evelyn Delacroix like a second skin as she surveyed her team sprawled across the artificial turf. Sweat glistened on their sun-baked foreheads, mixing with dirt kicked up from the relentless practice drills. The setting sun cast long shadows across the cracked field at Westview High School, turning the worn goalposts into skeletal figures against the bruised sky.

Evelyn felt a familiar knot in her stomach. This wasn't just another Friday night under the stadium lights; it was the state championship game. A chance for these kids to etch their names in school history, to prove that years of grueling practices and self-doubt hadn't been in vain. She watched them, each one battling fatigue and the rising pressure, a flicker of hope igniting within her. They were ready. And so was she.
