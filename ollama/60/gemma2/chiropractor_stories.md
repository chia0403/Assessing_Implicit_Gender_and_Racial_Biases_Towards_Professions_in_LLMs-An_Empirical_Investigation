The rain hammered against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Willow's clinic, mimicking the relentless ache in Mrs. Peterson's neck. It wasn't just the storm brewing outside; a tempest raged within the elderly woman, her face etched with frustration and pain. The familiar scent of peppermint oil and antiseptic hung heavy in the air, doing little to calm the tension crackling between them.

Eleanor Willow adjusted her glasses, the amber frames catching the dim light filtering through the rain-streaked glass. Her own shoulders were stiff from years of manually realigning spines, but she wouldn't let that show. Mrs. Peterson was a regular patient, and Eleanor knew her story by heart: a lifetime spent bent over bookshelves in the local library, followed by decades hunched over knitting needles, culminating in this agonizing neck pain. 

The clinic itself was nestled on a quiet side street in Oakhaven, a small town where everyone seemed to know each other's business. Its quaint wooden facade, painted a faded blue that matched the stormy sky, promised a sanctuary from the chaos of the world.  Inside, though, Eleanor knew that sometimes the most mundane problems could turn into raging storms, leaving both doctor and patient feeling battered and bruised.


Eleanor took a deep breath, steeling herself for the storm ahead. "Tell me what hurts, Mrs. Peterson," she said gently, her voice a soothing balm against the tempestuous backdrop.
