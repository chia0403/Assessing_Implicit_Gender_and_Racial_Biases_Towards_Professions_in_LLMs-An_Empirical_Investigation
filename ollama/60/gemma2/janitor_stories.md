The humid Florida air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins like a second skin as he mopped the linoleum floors of the Palm Beach Opera House. Moonlight filtered through the stained-glass windows high above, casting kaleidoscopic patterns across the empty stage. The scent of dust and old velvet lingered in the air, a ghostly echo of the night's performance - Verdi's Requiem, sung with such passion it had shaken the very foundation of the building. Now, silence reigned, broken only by the rhythmic swish of Bart's mop and the distant hum of the city beyond. He paused, leaning against his bucket, listening to the crickets chirping in the overgrown courtyard beyond the stage door. It was moments like these, amidst the hushed stillness, that Bart felt most at peace. This grand, imposing theatre, with its secrets whispered in every creaking floorboard and shadowy corner, held a strange allure for him. 


Bart wasn't just a janitor; he was a caretaker of stories, a silent witness to the dreams woven and shattered within these walls. He knew every inch of this place, from the chipped paint on the velvet curtains to the secret passageway leading to the costume room. And tonight, as he surveyed the deserted theatre bathed in moonlight, Bart felt a prickling sensation on the back of his neck â€“ a sense that something was different, something unexpected about to unfold.
