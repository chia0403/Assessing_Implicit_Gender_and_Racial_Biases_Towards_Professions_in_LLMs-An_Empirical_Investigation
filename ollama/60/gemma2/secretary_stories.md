The faint scent of stale coffee and desperation clung to the air in Ms. Eleanor Beatrice Quill's cramped office. Outside, London throbbed with a relentless energy – a cacophony of car horns, chattering pedestrians, and distant sirens. Inside, however, time seemed to crawl, each tick of the clock a tiny hammer blow against Eleanor's already frazzled nerves. 

Her boss, Lord Auberon Featherstonehaugh III, had gone missing again. This wasn't unusual. He had an unfortunate habit of disappearing at the most inconvenient times – like right before crucial meetings, during important phone calls, or when someone particularly annoying wanted to visit.  But this time was different. He'd vanished without a word, leaving behind a half-eaten breakfast and a crumpled note that simply read, "Gone fishing. Be back Tuesday."

Tuesday! That was tomorrow! And the investors were arriving first thing in the morning. Eleanor knew Lord Featherstonehaugh wasn’t the most reliable of men – but this was outrageous. His disappearance felt like an ominous prelude to something worse. 


The flickering light from her ancient desk lamp cast long shadows across the cluttered paperwork. A wave of nausea washed over Eleanor, and she clenched her jaw, refusing to panic. She had a job to do. Finding Lord Featherstonehaugh, however much he might deserve it, was now paramount.  She wouldn't let his negligence ruin everything.
