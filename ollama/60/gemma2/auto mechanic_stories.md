The air hung thick with the scent of burnt oil and hot metal, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of wrenches against steel.  Sparks showered like miniature stars from under Amelia "Amy" Rosethorn's workbench as she wrestled with a stubborn bolt on a 1967 Mustang fastback. Beads of sweat clung to her brow, but her focus remained laser-sharp. The engine block, stripped bare, gleamed under the harsh fluorescent lights of  “Rosethorn’s Repair,” a modest garage tucked away on the outskirts of Redwood City, California. 

The shop was Amy's pride and joy, inherited from her grandfather, a legendary mechanic known for his uncanny ability to breathe life back into even the most battered automobiles.  She'd learned everything she knew from him, pouring over greasy manuals and mastering the intricate dance between engine parts. But lately, business had been slow, threatening the very foundation of Amy's world. 


Now, with a stubborn grin plastered on her face, she faced this latest challenge: a vintage Mustang that hummed with potential but sputtered like a dying cat. It was more than just another job; it was a chance to prove herself, to honor her grandfather's legacy, and maybe even breathe some life back into Rosethorn’s Repair.
