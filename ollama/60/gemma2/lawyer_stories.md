The rain hammered against the glass panes of Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's office, mirroring the relentless drumming in her chest. The mahogany desk before her was piled high with files – each one a life, a story, a desperate plea for justice.  Her city, New Orleans, felt particularly oppressive tonight, its humid air thick with the scent of damp earth and brewing thunderstorms. Neon signs flickered through the downpour outside, casting an eerie glow on the rain-slicked streets below. 

Ellie, her dark hair pulled back in a tight bun, rubbed her temples, trying to quell the burgeoning headache. She was running on fumes – coffee, sheer willpower, and a gnawing sense of responsibility that never truly slept.  Tonight's case, however, felt different. It held a weight she hadn't encountered before, a darkness that threatened to swallow her whole. 


She glanced at the file in front of her: The State of Louisiana vs. Lucien Dubois. A young man accused of murder, facing life imprisonment. Ellie had seen the evidence, the testimonies, and something about it didn’t sit right. It felt…tainted. And she was determined to uncover the truth, no matter how murky the waters might be.
