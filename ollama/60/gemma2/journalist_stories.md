The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of The Blue Quill, a dive bar on the edge of New Orleans' French Quarter. Rain lashed against the windows, blurring the neon signs that promised cheap drinks and even cheaper thrills. 

Eleanor Beatrice "Ellie" Beaumont hunched over her notepad, scribbling furiously. A plume of cigarette smoke rose from the ashtray beside her, obscuring the face of the man she was interviewing.  He was a shifty character with eyes that darted around the room like trapped sparrows. His name was Jacques Dupre, and he claimed to have information about a string of disappearances plaguing the city. 

Ellie, known for her tenacity and willingness to chase down the city's darkest secrets, had been assigned this story by her editor at The Crescent City Chronicle. But something about Jacques' demeanor, his hesitant answers and veiled threats, made her gut churn with unease.  The Blue Quill wasn't the most glamorous location for an interview, but it was often a haven for those who lived in the city's underbelly - the whispers, rumors, and truths that never made it to the front page. Ellie hoped Jacques would be different, that he held the key to unraveling this mystery before another life vanished into the humid night.
