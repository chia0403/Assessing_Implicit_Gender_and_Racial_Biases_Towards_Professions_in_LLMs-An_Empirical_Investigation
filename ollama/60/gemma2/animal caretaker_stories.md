The scent of hay, manure, and wet fur hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket familiar to Amelia Grace Worthington since childhood. She ran a calloused hand down the weathered wood fence surrounding the paddock, her gaze sweeping over the three contented Clydesdale horses grazing lazily in the afternoon sun. The sprawling farm, nestled in the rolling hills of rural Vermont, had always been Amelia's sanctuary, a world away from the bustling city life she'd briefly tasted before returning to her roots.  Amelia, with her worn jeans, muddy boots, and wind-tangled red hair, felt utterly at home here. 

It was a place where time moved slower, measured by the rhythm of the seasons and the quiet symphony of farm sounds â€“ clucking chickens, snorting pigs, and the occasional bleating of sheep.  But today, an unfamiliar tension vibrated in the air, unsettling even Amelia's usually peaceful heart. A new arrival had just come to Maplewood Farm, a creature she hadn't anticipated, and one that carried with it a mystery that promised to upend her quiet life.
