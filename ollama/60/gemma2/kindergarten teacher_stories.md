The rhythmic thump-thump-thump of tiny feet echoed through Ms. Eloise Willowbrook's classroom. She knelt before a construction paper castle, its cardboard towers painted with valiant streaks of purple and orange. A small hand, sticky with glue and the lingering sweetness of popsicles, reached out to place a plastic dragon atop the turret. 

"Very good, Leo," Ms. Willowbrook chirped, her voice as warm and comforting as a freshly baked cookie.  Her own blonde curls were pulled back in a loose braid, escaping in wispy tendrils that danced around her smiling face. "That dragon looks ready to protect your castle from any knights!"

The classroom buzzed with the chaotic energy of five-year-olds. Crayons scribbled across paper, tiny voices recited alphabet letters, and building blocks tumbled into precarious towers. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, casting rainbows on the brightly colored wall murals depicting playful animals and fantastical creatures. The scent of freshly cut apples mingled with the faint aroma of crayons and playdough, a unique perfume that Ms. Willowbrook had come to cherish as her own personal blend of childhood magic. 


But beneath the cheerful facade, Ms. Willowbrook felt a knot of worry tightening in her chest. This year, something felt different. There was a quiet unease amongst the children, a shadow of sadness lurking behind their bright eyes. And she couldn't figure out why.
