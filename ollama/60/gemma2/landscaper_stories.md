The morning dew clung to Amelia Thistlewick’s shears like miniature diamonds, glinting under the weak October sun. A chill wind whipped through the rows of dahlias she was pruning, scattering stray petals like confetti across her carefully-tended beds. The air smelled of damp earth and decaying leaves, a bittersweet symphony of autumn. Amelia inhaled deeply, savoring the familiar scent that signaled the end of another growing season in her little corner of Vermont.

Her world was bounded by hedges, picket fences, and manicured lawns. She knew every inch of Oakhaven Gardens like the back of her hand, from the gnarled branches of the ancient oak overlooking the rose garden to the tiny forget-me-nots that clung stubbornly to life in the shade of the shed. 


Amelia Thistlewick, with her calloused hands and sun-weathered face, wasn't just a landscaper; she was an artist, sculpting beauty from nature’s bounty. But this year, the familiar rhythm of her work felt different. A disquiet hummed beneath the surface, whispering of change, of something unknown looming on the horizon.
