Rain lashed against the frosted windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic watercolour of neon streaks and hazy lights. The wind howled like a mournful beast, rattling the antique brass knocker on her door. Inside, Eleanor sat nestled in her plush leather armchair, a steaming mug of chamomile tea warming her hands.  The scent of cinnamon and vanilla filled the air, attempting to counter the chill that seemed to seep from the storm itself.

Eleanor was a counseling psychologist, her practice dedicated to guiding lost souls through the labyrinthine pathways of their own minds. She believed in the inherent resilience of the human spirit, but even she couldn't deny the weight of the world pressing down on her patients these days. Each face that crossed her threshold carried an unspoken story â€“  a tapestry woven with anxieties, fears, and dreams just out of reach. 

Tonight, however, the silence held a different kind of tension. She could feel it in the air, a palpable anticipation. The storm mirrored the turmoil brewing inside her own heart. A patient, she knew, was about to arrive who carried secrets that threatened to unravel everything she thought she understood.  


The rain intensified, drumming a frantic rhythm against the glass as the office door creaked open, revealing a figure silhouetted against the stormy night.
