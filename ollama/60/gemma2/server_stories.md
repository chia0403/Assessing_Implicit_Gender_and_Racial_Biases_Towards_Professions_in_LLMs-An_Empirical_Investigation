The sticky floor beneath Amelia 'Amy' Rose's worn-down sneakers felt like an unwelcome handshake as she stepped into the greasy gloom of "Benny's Burgers." The aroma of stale fries, burnt onions, and day-old coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent that usually brought a pang of nostalgia. Tonight, however, it only served to highlight the exhaustion clinging to Amy like a second skin.  

The diner was nearly empty, save for a lone trucker hunched over a mug of lukewarm coffee at the counter and a couple in a booth whispering secrets in hushed tones. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the chipped Formica tables and faded red vinyl booths, each one bearing the scars of countless spilled milkshakes and greasy kisses. 

Amy pulled her worn apron tight, its frayed edges digging into her hip bone. Another Friday night at Benny's.  Another symphony of clanging plates, impatient customers, and Benny's booming voice bellowing orders from behind the grill. It was a familiar tune, but tonight, Amy wasn't sure she wanted to hear it anymore.
