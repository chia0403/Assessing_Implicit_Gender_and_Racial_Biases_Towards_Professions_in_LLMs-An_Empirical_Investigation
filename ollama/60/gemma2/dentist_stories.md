The flickering neon sign outside Dr. Eleanor Finch's office cast an eerie green glow onto the rain-slicked asphalt. A steady drumming against the corrugated metal roof punctuated the otherwise silent night in Elmwood, a small town where secrets whispered on the wind and even the streetlights seemed to hold their breath. Inside, Eleanor scrubbed her hands for the fifth time, the faint metallic tang of disinfectant clinging to her fingertips. 

Her phone lay abandoned on the reception desk, its red notification light blinking accusingly. Another late-night call from a worried parent about their child’s toothache. It was becoming a regular occurrence, these emergency visits after hours, each one chipping away at Eleanor's carefully constructed routine. But Elmwood had no other dentist, and she prided herself on being a beacon of care in this forgotten corner of the world. 

Yet tonight, something felt different. A tremor ran through her, a prickling sensation along the back of her neck that had nothing to do with the chill seeping through the poorly insulated walls. The familiar hum of the dental drill seemed distant, replaced by an unnerving silence. Eleanor glanced at the clock – just past midnight – and swallowed hard. She was alone.
