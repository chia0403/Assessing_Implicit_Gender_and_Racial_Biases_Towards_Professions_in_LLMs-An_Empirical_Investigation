The neon sign outside "Rosie's Diner" flickered erratically, casting an oily rainbow across the rain-slicked asphalt.  A steady drizzle painted the city in shades of gray, mirroring the mood that had settled over Bartholomew 'Bart' Finchley III. He sat hunched in a booth, nursing a lukewarm coffee and ignoring the mournful crooning emanating from the jukebox. Rain hammered against the diner's windows, a relentless percussion to his thoughts. 

This case, the one that had dragged him out of a two-week bender and into this greasy spoon on the wrong side of town, was proving to be more tangled than a ball of Christmas lights in a hurricane.  His client, a nervous man named Harold Pruitt, claimed his wife had vanished without a trace, leaving behind only a cryptic note about "red sails" and "the midnight tide." 

Bart rubbed his temples, trying to coax some semblance of order out of the mess. He'd been in this business long enough to know that missing persons cases rarely had simple answers. But something about Harold's frantic desperation, the tremor in his voice when he spoke about his wife, made Bart want to dig deeper. 

The bell above the diner door jingled, announcing a new arrival. A woman stepped inside, shaking water from her trench coat. She glanced around the room, her eyes lingering on Bart for a moment before settling on the empty seat across from him. He raised an eyebrow, unsure if this was just another lost soul seeking refuge from the storm or something moreâ€¦interesting.
