The highway stretched before Jeremiah "Jay" Blackwood like a steel ribbon unfurling under the bruised sky. A thin veil of fog clung to the asphalt, swallowing the world in an eerie silence punctuated only by the rumble of his rig's engine and the crunch of gravel beneath his wheels.  He squinted through the windshield, trying to pierce the haze, but all he saw was a blurry canvas of grey and green fading into nothingness. 

Jay tugged at his worn baseball cap, pushing it back from his forehead as he shifted gears, the familiar whine echoing in the cab. He'd been on this stretch of Route 66 for hours, hauling a load of oranges from California to Chicago, but the monotony was starting to gnaw at him. The air inside his rig felt thick with diesel fumes and stale coffee, and the silence pressed down on him like a physical weight.  

He longed for the hum of conversation, the warmth of a diner booth, anything to break the oppressive solitude that came with being a trucker â€“ a lonely king navigating his own kingdom of asphalt and chrome.
