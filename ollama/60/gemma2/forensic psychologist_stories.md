The stale scent of disinfectant hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Dr. Eleanor Vance. She stood at the threshold of interrogation room two, its fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows on the linoleum floor. The faint hum of machinery emanated from somewhere beyond the concrete walls, a constant reminder that she was inside Haddonfield Penitentiary, not some sterile university lecture hall.

The year was 2024.  Haddonfield, notorious for housing some of the nation's most hardened criminals, had recently become the testing ground for a new program - rehabilitating inmates through behavioral therapy and forensic psychology intervention. Eleanor, with her impeccable credentials and steely resolve, had been chosen to lead it.  

Her gaze fell on the figure seated across the table. A man, gaunt and pale, his eyes flickering nervously behind thick glasses. This was Michael Anderson, convicted of arson and multiple counts of attempted murder. His chillingly blank expression hinted at a darkness Eleanor knew she would need all her skill and intuition to unravel. He was her first case, the bellwether for an experiment that could either change the very fabric of the justice system or shatter it beyond repair. 


The weight of those possibilities pressed down on Eleanor as she took a deep breath and stepped into the room. Her voice, calm and measured, broke the tense silence. "Michael," she began, "I'm Dr. Vance. I'd like to talk to you about what happened."
