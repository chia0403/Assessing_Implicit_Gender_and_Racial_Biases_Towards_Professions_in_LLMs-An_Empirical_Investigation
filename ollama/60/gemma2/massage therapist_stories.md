The scent of lavender and eucalyptus hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint smell of sandalwood and something else… almost metallic, like old pennies.  Elise Abernathy sighed, pushing aside a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her loose bun. The aroma usually calmed her, but today it felt cloying, heavy like the humidity clinging to Charleston in August. 

Her massage room was a sanctuary of calm: dim lighting, soft music playing through hidden speakers, and fluffy white towels stacked neatly on the stainless steel table.  But even this haven couldn't fully mask the sense of unease that had settled over her since the call that morning. An anonymous tip, whispering about a client she wouldn't recognize, seeking a "deep tissue" massage with a specific focus on… well, the caller hadn’t been clear about that last part. Just unsettlingly vague.  


Elise traced the intricate pattern etched into the wooden floorboards. She usually enjoyed her work; helping people find relief from stress and pain was deeply satisfying. But this call had thrown her off balance, leaving a knot of anxiety she couldn't quite untangle.
