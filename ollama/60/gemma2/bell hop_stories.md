The Grand Bellweather Hotel buzzed with the kind of frenetic energy only a place packed with tourists on their last day could muster. Suitcases sat in neat rows by the lobby doors, like anxious puppies waiting for walkies.  Luggage carts rolled down the polished marble floor, scattering echoes that bounced off the ornate chandeliers hanging from the vaulted ceiling. In this symphony of departure, Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew III, bellhop extraordinaire and master of navigating the labyrinthine halls with a smile perpetually plastered on his face, stood at attention by the entrance. His crisp uniform – a navy blue jacket with brass buttons, pristine white trousers, and a jaunty cap perched atop his head – practically radiated efficiency.  

Teddy loved the Grand Bellweather. The stories whispered through the walls, the guests from all walks of life, the constant hum of activity - it was like living in a well-worn novel, each day unfolding with its own peculiar charm. 


But today felt different. A palpable tension hung in the air, a disquiet beneath the surface bustle.  Teddy couldn't pinpoint it, but something felt off. Perhaps it was the way Mrs. Periwinkle, a regular guest known for her love of gossip and sherry, hadn't emerged from her suite yet. Or maybe it was the unusual number of staff members huddled in hushed whispers near the kitchen door. Whatever it was, Teddy had a nagging feeling that this last day wouldn't end as usual.
