The air hung thick with the smell of pine needles and damp earth, a scent as familiar to Thomas Blackwood as his own heartbeat. Sunlight filtered through the towering Douglas firs, casting long shadows that danced across the forest floor like phantoms. A symphony of birdsong filled the crisp morning air, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of Thomas's axe against hardwood. He swung with practiced ease, each blow splitting the ancient giants into manageable sections. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes, but he didn't falter. This was his lifeblood, this dance between man and nature, a legacy passed down through generations of Blackwoods.

He closed his eyes for a moment, drawing strength from the wind rustling through the leaves, feeling the familiar pulse of the forest beneath his boots.
