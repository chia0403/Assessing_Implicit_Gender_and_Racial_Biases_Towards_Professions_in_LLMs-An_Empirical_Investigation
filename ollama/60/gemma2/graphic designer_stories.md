The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's head like disgruntled bees, casting a sickly yellow pallor over her workspace. Rain lashed against the windows of her tiny, ground-floor studio apartment in Brooklyn, blurring the already indistinct cityscape into a watercolour wash. Papers were piled precariously high on every surface â€“ scraps of rough sketches, torn magazine pages plastered with colour swatches, and discarded coffee cups testament to Amelia's all-night design bender. 

She squinted at the screen, her reflection staring back at her -  a woman in her late twenties with smudged eyeliner and hair escaping its messy bun. The client brief for "Boldly Bloom," a new organic skincare line, glared back at her from the digital canvas. Amelia needed to come up with something that screamed "natural" but also "luxury." It was a tightrope walk, and she felt more like she was teetering on the edge of a cliff. 

She rubbed her tired eyes, willing inspiration to strike.  Maybe a walk in the rain would do the trick? Or perhaps another shot of espresso was needed... or both?
