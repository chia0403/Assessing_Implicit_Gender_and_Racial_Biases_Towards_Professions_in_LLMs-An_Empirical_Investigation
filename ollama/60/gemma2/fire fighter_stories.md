The acrid smell of smoke always made Elara Skye’s throat tighten, but this time it felt different. It wasn't the usual comforting tang of burning wood and insulation that she knew so well from countless training exercises and actual fires. This was something sharp, almost metallic, laced with a sickly sweetness that sent a shiver down her spine. 

The flickering red and blue lights of the approaching ambulance painted the deserted street in an eerie glow. Elara, perched on the fire engine ladder, her helmet tilted back to better see the scene unfolding below, felt a knot of dread tighten in her stomach.  She knew this wasn't just another run-of-the-mill call. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the dilapidated warehouse district, its decaying brick buildings looming like skeletal giants against the bruised sky. The air, thick with the smell of smoke and something else she couldn’t quite place, hung heavy over the scene.  Elara watched as paramedics rushed into the derelict building, their faces grim beneath the flashing lights. Her partner, a seasoned firefighter named Jake, nudged her shoulder.

"Get ready," he said, his voice gruff but firm. "This one's going to be rough."
