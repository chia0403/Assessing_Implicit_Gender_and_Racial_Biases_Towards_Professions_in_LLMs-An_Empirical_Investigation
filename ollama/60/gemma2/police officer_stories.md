The grimy streets of New Albion shimmered like an oil slick under the streetlights, reflecting the city's perpetual state of twilight. Ellie sighed, adjusting her collar against the chill seeping through the worn leather jacket. Another night shift in the belly of the beast, she thought, a familiar ache settling in her chest. The air was thick with the scent of stale beer and desperation, punctuated by the occasional crackle of static from her radio. It was always louder after dark, the city's underbelly stirring like a restless beast, hungry for chaos. Tonight, Ellie felt it more than usual. A prickling sensation on the back of her neck whispered that something was about to break loose.
