The aroma of burnt toast hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender hand soap from Amelia Rose Beaumont's freshly scrubbed hands. It was 6:30 AM, just as the sun peeked over the rooftops of Charleston, casting long shadows across her tiny kitchen. Amelia, a petite woman with auburn hair pulled back in a messy bun, sighed and scraped the charred remains from the toaster.  

Her apartment, perched on the third floor of a creaky old building overlooking Rainbow Row, was cluttered with cookbooks, nutrition charts, and stacks of journals overflowing with patient notes. Outside her window, the city slowly woke up, its cobblestone streets soon to be bustling with tourists and locals alike. Amelia, however, was already deep in work, reviewing the latest dietary plan for Mrs. Henderson, a retiree with a penchant for pecan pie and an aversion to vegetables. 

Charleston's vibrant food scene both fascinated and frustrated Amelia. She loved the city's culinary heritage, its Gullah cuisine, the fresh seafood, and the sweet tea that flowed like water. But her job as a dietician often felt like a constant battle against the siren call of delicious, but unhealthy treats. Today, however, she was determined to make healthy choices for herself. After all, you can't preach wellness if you can't even toast your own bread properly.
