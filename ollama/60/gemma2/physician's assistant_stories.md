The air in Mercy General’s ER was thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear.  Amelia “Amy” Reyes, PA-C, took it all in with practiced calm. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow over the flurry of activity: nurses barking orders, paramedics wrestling a gurney through the swinging doors, doctors hunched over charts, their faces etched with fatigue. 

Amy leaned against the triage desk, her worn stethoscope draped around her neck like a familiar talisman. Her eyes scanned the waiting room, landing on a young mother cradling a feverish child, her face pale and drawn.  A teenage boy with a gash above his eye sat slumped in a chair, his arm in a makeshift sling, while an elderly gentleman, his breathing shallow and labored, lay strapped to a gurney. This was Amy’s world: the constant pulse of life and death, the unpredictable ebb and flow of chaos and quiet. 

She took a deep breath, steeling herself for the shift ahead. As the head PA on duty, she was the anchor in this storm, guiding the medical team, calming anxious patients, and bridging the gap between doctors and nurses. And tonight, like every other night, she was ready to do what she did best: mend broken bodies and soothe troubled minds.
