The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Jedediah "Jed" Blackwood's weathered face as he surveyed his spread.  Dust devils danced across the cracked earth, their swirling forms mimicking the turmoil in Jed's gut. His cattle ranch, Blackwood Ridge, had been his family's legacy for generations, a testament to grit and resilience in the unforgiving heart of the Sonoran Desert. But lately, drought had turned the once vibrant grasslands into brittle skeletons, leaving the herd gaunt and the future uncertain.  

Jed leaned against the rusted fence post, squinting at the horizon where the shimmering heat distorted the landscape. A hawk circled overhead, its mournful cry a stark counterpoint to the oppressive silence that had settled over the ranch. 


"This ain't right," Jed muttered, his voice raspy from dust and worry. "Ain't right at all."
