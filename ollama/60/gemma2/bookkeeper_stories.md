The scent of old paper and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar aroma that clung to Amelia Beatrice Blackwood like a second skin. She sat hunched over her worn oak desk, the midday sun casting long shadows across the cluttered expanse of ledgers and invoices spread before her. The tiny office, tucked away on the third floor of an aging brick building in downtown Baltimore, was Amelia's sanctuary. 

It wasn't much to look at – faded floral wallpaper, cracked linoleum floors, and a window overlooking a grimy alleyway – but it was hers. Her father had bequeathed it to her after his untimely passing five years ago, and she’d painstakingly kept the bookshop he'd run for decades afloat, even as its popularity dwindled with the advent of online bookstores. 

Amelia ran a hand through her unruly auburn hair, pushing aside a stray curl that had fallen across her face. The stack of unpaid bills threatening to topple over on her desk was a constant reminder that the shop's precarious existence wasn't sustainable forever. She needed a solution, and fast.  But for now, she retreated into the comforting routine of numbers, finding solace in the neat rows and predictable patterns of the ledgers.
