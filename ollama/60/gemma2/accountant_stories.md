The whirring of the vintage fan did little to combat the August humidity clinging to Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright like a second skin. Sweat beaded on her upper lip, mirroring the tiny beads of condensation forming on the iced tea sweating in her hand. The air hung thick and heavy in her cramped office, smelling faintly of stale coffee and desperation – a common aroma these days at Cartwright & Son Accounting. 

Eleanor sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the mountain of tax forms before her. Each one represented another small business teetering on the brink, their financial futures tangled in a knot of invoices, expenses, and unpaid taxes.  She longed for the days when accounting was simply about numbers, not navigating the emotional minefield of local entrepreneurs fighting to keep their dreams alive. 


The setting sun cast long shadows through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating the faded floral wallpaper and chipped Formica desk – a testament to years of unyielding dedication to her family's business. Outside, crickets chirped a melancholic tune, mimicking the weary drumbeat in Eleanor's chest. She rubbed her eyes, hoping for a spark of inspiration, a glimmer of hope amidst the paperwork chaos.  Perhaps tomorrow, she thought, would be different. Perhaps tomorrow wouldn't feel so much like an uphill battle against an ever-growing tide of despair.
