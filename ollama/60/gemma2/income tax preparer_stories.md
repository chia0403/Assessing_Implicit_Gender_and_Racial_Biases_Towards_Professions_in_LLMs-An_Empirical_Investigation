The aroma of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of Beatrice "Bea" Juniper's tiny office.  A faded banner proclaiming "Beat the Deadline with Bea!" drooped above her desk like a wilted flower. 

Her window overlooked Main Street, where snow was starting to fall, blurring the neon signs into watercolor streaks. It was Tax Season, and the small town of Harmony Creek was in full panic mode. Everyone seemed to be clutching their receipts and wringing their hands, waiting for Bea's verdict on whether they owed Uncle Sam or were due a refund.  Bea herself wasn't feeling much better. The endless parade of spreadsheets and forms had left her with a dull headache and a longing for the serenity of her rose garden. 

But she wouldn't complain. Harmony Creek was all she knew, and helping people navigate the treacherous waters of the IRS felt like a kind of service, even if it wasn't always appreciated. Besides, there was something comforting about the predictable rhythm of tax season. It was a world she understood, where numbers told a story and every deduction held a little victory.


This year, though, something felt different. Bea could sense it in the air, a tremor of unease that went beyond the usual anxieties of April. And as the first snow flakes swirled outside her window, she couldn't shake the feeling that this tax season would be anything but ordinary.
