The insistent chirping of the phone pulled Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick from her daydream. A sigh escaped her lips as she reached for the receiver, her fingers brushing against the smooth, cool surface of the vintage Bakelite handset. 

Amelia worked at the "Grand" Apothecary, a name bestowed upon it more out of wishful thinking than reality. It was tucked away on a cobbled side street in Edinburgh, its chipped paint and dusty windowpanes doing little to inspire grandeur. The building itself, however, was old – centuries old, its walls rumored to whisper secrets from the city’s turbulent past.  

Despite the gloomy atmosphere, Amelia found solace in the apothecary’s quiet routines: sorting herbs by their pungent aromas, filing away ancient medical texts, and occasionally brewing a cup of chamomile tea strong enough to soothe even the most agitated customer. Today, though, was different. A new shipment had arrived, overflowing with exotic jars filled with shimmering powders and dried plants unlike anything Amelia had ever seen. The air crackled with an unfamiliar energy, whispering of forgotten lore and potent secrets waiting to be unlocked. And then came the phone call.
