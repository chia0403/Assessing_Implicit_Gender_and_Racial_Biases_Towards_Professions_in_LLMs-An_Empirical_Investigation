The midday sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart" McAlister's neck, turning his already tanned skin the color of mahogany. Sweat beaded on his brow, tracing invisible paths through the grime caked upon his face. He wiped it away with the back of his grimy hand, squinting at the cityscape unfolding before him. 

The city sprawled beneath him like a patchwork quilt, its buildings rising in jagged peaks and sprawling valleys of grey concrete and glass. From atop this modest three-story brownstone, Bart could see everything: the bustling market square with its cacophony of hawkers and chatter, the grand clock tower that chimed the hour relentlessly, and the ever-present plume of smoke curling from the city's factory district in the distance. This was his kingdom - a world of rooftops and eaves, flashing and shingles, where the only music was the rhythmic clang of hammer on nail and the occasional mournful wail of a passing siren.
