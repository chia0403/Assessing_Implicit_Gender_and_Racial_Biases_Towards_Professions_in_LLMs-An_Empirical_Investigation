The air in "Apothecary & Curiosities" hung thick with the scent of dried lavender and peppermint, a comforting aroma that usually soothed Amelia Rosalind Hawthorne's anxieties. But today, the familiar smells did little to ease the knot twisting in her stomach.  

The shop itself was nestled in a quaint corner of Hollow Creek, a town where time seemed to move at a slower pace. Victorian-era buildings with peeling paint lined cobblestone streets, and gossip traveled faster than the meandering creek that gave the town its name. Amelia’s shop, however, stood apart. Its windows overflowed with glass jars filled with herbs, roots, and shimmering powders, alongside antique telescopes and peculiar trinkets collected on her father's travels. 

Amelia adjusted her spectacles, their lenses catching the light filtering through the stained-glass window depicting a phoenix rising from flames. She glanced at the worn clock above the counter, its pendulum swinging erratically as if mirroring her own unease. It was almost noon, and there was still no sign of Mr. Blackwood, her most peculiar customer. He usually arrived precisely at this hour, his pale face hidden behind a wide-brimmed hat, requesting strange concoctions whispered only in hushed tones by the town’s elderly residents. 


Today, however, silence hung heavy in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic tick-tock of the clock and the soft chirping of sparrows outside the window. A sense of foreboding settled upon Amelia, making her question whether Mr. Blackwood's absence was a mere coincidence or something more sinister.
