The amber glow of the Edison bulb hanging above her station cast long shadows across Elara "Ellie" Nightingale's weary face. She wiped down the already spotless mahogany bar with a practiced flick of her wrist, her gaze drifting towards the rain-streaked window. Each drop that splashed against the glass seemed to echo the dull ache in her chest, a familiar companion after another grueling shift at The Last Drop. 

The Last Drop was a dive bar nestled in the heart of Bellhaven, a forgotten corner of Seattle where neon signs flickered with faded promises and secrets whispered like smoke through cracked windows. It was a haven for lost souls, weary travelers, and everyone caught between dreams that had died and the grim reality of their lives. 

Ellie knew them all by name, their stories etched onto her soul as deeply as the scars that marred her own past. She poured their sorrows into shot glasses, listened to their confessions with a knowing nod, and offered them solace in the bottom of a cold beer. Tonight, though, even The Last Drop felt heavy, its usual warmth suffocated by a palpable sense of unease.
