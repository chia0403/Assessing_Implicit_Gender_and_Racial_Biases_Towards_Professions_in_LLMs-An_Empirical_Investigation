The rusted swing set creaked mournfully in the drizzle, its chipped paint blending with the faded grey of the concrete playground. Rain splattered on Sarah Amelia Cartwright's trench coat as she surveyed the scene, her gaze lingering on the cracked asphalt and overgrown weeds that choked the edges of the park. This was Meadowbrook, a forgotten pocket of Detroit where dreams went to die and hope clung precariously to life. It was also the stomping ground of one Michael "Mikey" Jackson, a boy on probation for armed robbery who was Sarah's latest charge.  

Sarah wasnâ€™t sure if she felt more pity or exasperation for Mikey. He was just sixteen, his face still holding onto some traces of childhood innocence that had been brutally eroded by the harsh realities of his environment. She knew he had potential, a flicker of intelligence buried under layers of anger and resentment. Her job was to help him find that light before it was extinguished forever. But Meadowbrook had a way of sucking the hope out of even the strongest souls, and Sarah wasn't naive enough to believe this would be an easy case.
