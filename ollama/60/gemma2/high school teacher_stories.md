The fluorescent lights hummed above Ms. Eleanor Rosalind Finchâ€™s head like a chorus of disgruntled bees, their droning a constant soundtrack to her already chaotic life. The air in Room 214 smelled vaguely of stale pizza and teenage angst, a potent combination that had become the norm during her ten years at Northgate High. Papers littered her desk - graded essays, permission slips for the upcoming school play, and a stack of overdue library books threatening to topple over like a Jenga tower.  

Eleanor sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that escaped from her bun. Outside, the October wind howled, rattling the windows of the aging building. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the world outside into a watercolour wash of greys and browns. A perfect day to be inside, grading papers, sipping lukewarm coffee, and pretending she didn't feel the familiar weight of dread settling in her stomach. Today was the day of the parent-teacher conferences, and Eleanor knew it wouldn't be pretty.
