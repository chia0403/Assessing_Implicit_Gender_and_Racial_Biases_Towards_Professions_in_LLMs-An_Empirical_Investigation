The air in Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's workshop crackled with static, mimicking the nervous energy buzzing beneath her skin.  She squinted at the intricate network of wires and capacitors spread across her workbench, a mess of copper and tin mirroring the storm raging outside. Rain lashed against the corrugated metal roof of the abandoned lighthouse, each gust a drumbeat against the silence punctuated only by the hiss of Ellie's soldering iron.

The old radio tower stood sentinel over the desolate coastline of Maine, its once-bright beacon now a rusted relic casting long shadows across the windswept beach below. Here, in this forgotten outpost, Ellie had carved out her life as a radio technician, her only companions the ghosts of past transmissions and the endless roar of the Atlantic. 


She wasn't entirely alone. There were whispers, stories passed down through generations about a hidden signal, a faint whisper on the airwaves that held secrets too dangerous to uncover. A secret Ellie was determined to find.  

Tonight, the storm seemed to amplify those whispers, each crackle and pop of static sounding like a coded message just beyond her grasp. With a deep breath, Ellie tightened the last connection, her fingers lingering over the microphone as if testing its power to bridge the impossible distance between herself and whatever lay hidden in the darkness beyond the waves.
