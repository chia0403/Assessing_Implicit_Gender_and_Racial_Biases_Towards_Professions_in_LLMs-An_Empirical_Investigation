The midday sun beat down on Alexandria "Lexi" Finch's shoulders as she gestured toward the crumbling sandstone facade before her. Sweat pricked at her brow, but she plastered a smile on her face that could rival the gargoyle perched precariously above them.  

“And this, folks,” Lexi announced to her group of wide-eyed tourists, “is the majestic entrance to Castle Blackwood, shrouded in centuries of whispered secrets and… well, let's just say it’s seen its fair share of drama.” 

Lexi surveyed her audience: a gaggle of teenagers glued to their phones, a middle-aged couple snapping photos with wide grins, and an elderly gentleman who looked like he was already regretting his decision to embark on this walking tour.  The castle loomed before them, a sprawling monstrosity of grey stone against the cerulean sky. The imposing structure seemed to swallow the sunlight, casting long, unsettling shadows across the overgrown courtyard. 

It wasn't exactly the picture-perfect medieval wonderland many tourists expected. But Lexi knew that was part of its charm – and her job was to make sure they felt it, too. 


The air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a strange mix that whispered tales of forgotten grandeur and hidden dangers.  Lexi took a deep breath, steeling herself for another tour through the castle's labyrinthine halls, where history mingled with myth and every creaking step echoed with the ghosts of its past.
