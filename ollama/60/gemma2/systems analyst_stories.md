Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's cubicle, blurring the already hazy cityscape beyond. A symphony of keyboard clicks and whispered phone calls filled the air, punctuated by the rhythmic hum of the cooling fans struggling to keep pace with the demands of their vast network.  Amelia, perched precariously on a stool that strained under her considerable weight, stared at the blinking cursor taunting her from the screen.

Amelia knew time was running out. The board meeting with potential investors loomed just three days away, and failure was not an option. 


She rubbed her temples, hoping a quick coffee break would clear the mental fog. As she pushed back from her desk, a flicker of movement in the reflection of the monitor caught her eye. A single pixel, out of place, pulsed with an unnatural, almost iridescent light.  It wasn't there before. 


Amelia leaned closer, her heart quickening. Could it be…? Was Project Chimera somehow... awakening?
