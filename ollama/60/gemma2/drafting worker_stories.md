The air in the Drafting Room hummed with the dull roar of dozens of mechanical pencils scratching against tracing paper. The scent of stale coffee mingled with the sharp tang of erasers. Sunlight slanted through the grime-coated windows, illuminating dust motes swirling in the shafts of light that fell upon cluttered workbenches.  

Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne ran a trembling finger across a meticulously drawn blueprint, her brow furrowed in concentration. Her glasses perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, threatening to slide down with every twitch of her head. Amelia was one of the few women who dared to work at the esteemed architectural firm of Vandermeer & Sons, and she had clawed her way into a position as a draftsperson through sheer talent and relentless dedication. But today, even Amelia's meticulous attention to detail wasn't enough to quell the growing unease gnawing at her. 


**Setting:**

A bustling drafting room in a turn-of-the-century architectural firm in New York City.  Think cramped quarters, flickering gaslight, piles of blueprints, and the constant clatter of pencils against paper. The year is 1903.
