The crimson sun bled across the horizon, painting the vast ochre dunes of Mars in fiery hues. The air shimmered with heat, distorting the silhouette of the abandoned mining outpost jutting up against the sky like a rusted tooth.  A lone figure, Captain Evelyn Astraea Vance, emerged from the shadow of her battered landing craft, the 'Phoenix'. Her weathered face, framed by wind-whipped auburn hair, held a grim determination as she surveyed the desolate landscape. The comms crackled with static, a constant reminder of her isolation â€“ a single human beacon amidst the silent immensity of Mars.  

"Phoenix to base," she muttered into the comm unit strapped to her helmet, her voice raspy from lack of water. "No response. Come in, base."


Only silence answered.
