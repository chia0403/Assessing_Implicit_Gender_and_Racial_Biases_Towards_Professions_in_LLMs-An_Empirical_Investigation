The sterile scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of blood. Rain lashed against the windows of the emergency room, mimicking the frantic drumming of Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Harper's heart. Her fingers tightened around the cool metal of the IV stand as she glanced down at the patient – a young boy, barely more than ten years old, his face pale and drawn, his breath coming in shallow gasps. His eyes, though clouded with pain, held a spark of terrified defiance that mirrored Amy's own battle against the encroaching chaos. 

It was late, past midnight on a dreary Tuesday, the kind of night that seemed to amplify every ache and anxiety in the world. The ER was crammed – overflowing beds lined the hallways, nurses rushed between them like harried sparrows, doctors barked orders into phones, and the air buzzed with a frenetic energy that could either fuel you or break you. Amy, however, had learned to thrive in this maelstrom. For her, the ER wasn't just a workplace, it was a battlefield where she fought for life every single shift. 


This particular night, the stakes felt higher than ever. The boy needed immediate surgery, but resources were stretched thin, and another critical patient arrived just as Amy turned to call for the surgeon. The storm outside raged on, a silent echo of the tempest brewing within the walls of the hospital.
