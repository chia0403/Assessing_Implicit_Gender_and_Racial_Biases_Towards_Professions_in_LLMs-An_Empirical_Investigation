The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Harper like a second skin as she stepped out of her car. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the parking lot of "Rehab & Revive," her small private practice nestled between a bustling smoothie shop and a pawnbroker with a suspiciously dusty window display. 

Amelia ran a hand through her messy auburn ponytail, already starting to feel the sweat prickling at her temples.  She hated that summer heat, but it was a price she paid for living in this vibrant little beach town. Today, like every day, she carried the weight of her patients' hopes on her shoulders. Each ache, each spasm, each struggle with mobility felt deeply personal to Amelia. She wasnâ€™t just a therapist; she was a sculptor, coaxing strength and movement back into broken bodies. 


The bell above the door jingled as she pushed it open, releasing the scent of antiseptic and lavender essential oil that always hung in her clinic.  Amelia took a deep breath, steeling herself for another day of helping people reclaim their lives, one aching muscle at a time.
