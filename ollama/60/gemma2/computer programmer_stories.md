The neon glow from the ramen stall across the street bled into Amelia "Amy" Chandra's office window, casting long shadows across her keyboard.  Her fingers flew over the keys, battling with a particularly stubborn bug in the code for an AI-powered poetry generator. The humid Hong Kong air hung heavy outside, punctuated by the honking symphony of traffic and the distant rumble of the MTR.

Amy's cramped apartment served as both her home and office.  The walls were plastered with hand-drawn diagrams, half-finished code snippets scribbled on sticky notes, and posters from obscure tech conferences sheâ€™d attended. The air was thick with the scent of instant noodles and burnt coffee, a testament to her long hours spent wrestling with complex algorithms.

Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down Amy's spine as she stared at the lines of code on her screen. It wasn't just the bug that was troubling her; there was a strange rhythm to it, a pattern that seemed almost... intentional.
