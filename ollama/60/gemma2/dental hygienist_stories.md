The air in Aspen Dental hung heavy with the sterile scent of disinfectant and peppermint mouthwash.  Sunlight slanted through the dusty blinds, painting stripes across Eleanor Beatrice Miller's worn-out sneakers as she meticulously scrubbed the patient chair’s armrests. It wasn't exactly glamorous, but Ellie had always found a strange satisfaction in making things clean and shiny.

Her shift was just starting, a Tuesday morning like any other in this small town dentist office nestled between a laundromat and a discount beauty supply store. Outside, the familiar rumble of Mrs. Peterson’s old Ford pickup echoed down Main Street, signaling the start of another day in Harmony Ridge, a place where gossip travelled faster than the mailman and everyone knew your business by lunch. Ellie sighed, hoping that today’s appointments wouldn't involve any particularly interesting revelations from the latest town drama.
