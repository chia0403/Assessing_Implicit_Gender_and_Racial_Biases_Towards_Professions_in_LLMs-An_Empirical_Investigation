The air hung thick with pine and sawdust as Elias Blackwood wrestled the gargantuan Douglas fir to the ground. Sunlight slanted through the towering canopy, dappling his rough hands and weathered face. Sweat stung his eyes, but he didn't dare pause. The clock was ticking, always ticking in this unforgiving wilderness. He needed another full load before nightfall, or his boss would have his hide.

Elias lived for these moments - the raw power of the ancient trees, the symphony of groaning wood and whirring chainsaws, the satisfaction of felling a giant that had stood for centuries.  But today, something felt off. An unnatural stillness hung in the air, punctuated by the distant cawing of a raven. Even the wind seemed to hold its breath. He glanced nervously at the dense, shadowy forest surrounding him. Something wasn't right.

This was his territory - miles of towering redwoods and Douglas firs stretching as far as the eye could see. Elias knew every creak and groan of the ancient giants, every rustle in the undergrowth. Yet, today, a prickling unease ran down his spine. He couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.
