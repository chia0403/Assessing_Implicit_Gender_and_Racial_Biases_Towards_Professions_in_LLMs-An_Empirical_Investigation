The air crackled with static, mirroring the storm raging outside Elias Blackwood's ramshackle workshop. Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, drumming a chaotic rhythm that competed with the insistent whine emanating from the ancient radio receiver perched precariously on his workbench. Elias, a man whose face was etched with the wisdom of countless soldered connections and untangled wires, hunched over the machine, his brow furrowed in concentration.

His workshop, tucked away in a forgotten corner of the bustling port city of Saltwind, was a sanctuary of flickering fluorescent lights and the sweet, metallic scent of solder. Wires snaked across the floor like metallic vines, connecting half-assembled radios to dusty test benches. Tools, both modern and archaic, lay scattered amongst coils, capacitors, and vacuum tubes - testament to Elias's lifelong passion for coaxing sound from the ether.

Tonight, however, the static was proving particularly stubborn. A faint voice, barely audible beneath the storm's fury, seemed to be struggling for life within the radio's bowels. Elias tightened a screw on the receiver, his calloused fingers moving with practiced ease. The voice wavered, then strengthened momentarily before fading back into the static abyss.

"Who are you?" Elias muttered, leaning closer to the speaker. "What do you want?"
