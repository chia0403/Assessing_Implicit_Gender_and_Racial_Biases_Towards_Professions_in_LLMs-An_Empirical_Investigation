The air conditioning hummed in Alistair Cavendish’s office, struggling valiantly against the unforgiving summer sun beating down on Manhattan. Outside, yellow cabs honked their discontent, weaving through the concrete jungle like impatient wasps. But inside, Alistair was cool and collected, his crisp white shirt and navy tie mirroring the calmness he projected to his clients.  He tapped a manicured fingernail against a printout of Tesla’s latest quarterly report, his brow furrowed in concentration. The numbers were good, but something felt off.

Alistair wasn't just another Wall Street suit chasing quick profits. He prided himself on his intuitive understanding of the market, a talent honed through years of relentless study and an uncanny ability to read between the lines. Something about Tesla’s recent surge didn't sit right with him; it felt too orchestrated, too convenient.

As he reached for his phone to call his contact at Tesla, a sharp knock startled him. The door swung open revealing Beatrice, his impeccably dressed assistant. 


"Mr. Cavendish," she said, her voice crisp and efficient, "you have a visitor. He insists on seeing you immediately."

Alistair raised an eyebrow. Unannounced visitors were rare in his world. “Who is it?”

Beatrice hesitated for a moment, glancing nervously over her shoulder. “He says his name is Ezra Thorne. And he claims to have information about Tesla that you might find…interesting.”

A chill ran down Alistair’s spine. Interesting was one word for it. Dangerous might be another.
