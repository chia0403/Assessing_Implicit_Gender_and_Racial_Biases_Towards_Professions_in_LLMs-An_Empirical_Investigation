Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the clinic, each drop echoing like a tiny hammer blow in the cavernous space. Eleanor Vance shivered, pulling her cardigan tighter around her shoulders. The power had been flickering all morning, threatening to plunge them into darkness.  

Outside, the wind whipped palm fronds into a frenzy, mirroring the storm brewing inside Eleanor. Today was supposed to be Maya's first session with her new prosthetic leg. Maya, a bright-eyed twelve-year-old who'd lost her limb in a car accident last year. Eleanor had poured hours into preparing for this day, meticulously crafting a personalized rehabilitation plan. But now, with the clinic shrouded in gloom and the rhythmic thump of the rain a relentless soundtrack, Eleanor felt a gnawing anxiety she couldn’t shake off. What if Maya wasn't ready? What if the leg felt strange, uncomfortable, a constant reminder of what she had lost?


Eleanor took a deep breath, reminding herself of her training, of the countless successes she’d witnessed in her years as an occupational therapist. She would make this work. For Maya. For herself.  

The clinic door creaked open, revealing Maya and her mother, both clutching umbrellas dripping with rainwater. Eleanor forced a smile, hoping it reached her tired eyes. This was it. Time to face the storm head-on.
