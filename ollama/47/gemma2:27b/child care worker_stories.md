Rain hammered against the windows of "Little Explorers," blurring the vibrant crayon drawings taped to the glass. Inside, Amelia Rose Cartwright hummed along to the Sesame Street theme song blasting from the tiny Bluetooth speaker perched precariously on a shelf stacked with brightly colored picture books.

Five pairs of wide eyes stared up at her, captivated by Big Bird's antics. Amelia smiled, her heart swelling with a familiar warmth. Despite the chaos of spilled juice boxes and rogue crayon marks, this was her happy place. The laughter, the boundless energy, the sticky fingers reaching for hugs â€“ these were the things that made Amelia forget about the chipped mugs and perpetually overflowing diaper bins.

Today, however, something felt different. A knot of anxiety tightened in Amelia's chest as she glanced at the clock ticking relentlessly towards lunchtime. Mrs. Henderson, usually punctual with her son, Ethan, was already twenty minutes late. And Ethan, ever the social butterfly, sat unusually quiet, his chin resting on his fist, a furrow etched between his bushy eyebrows.
