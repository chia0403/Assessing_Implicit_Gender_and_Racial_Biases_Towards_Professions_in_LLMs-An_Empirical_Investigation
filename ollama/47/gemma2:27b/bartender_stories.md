Rain lashed against the grimy windows of The Last Call, each drop exploding in a miniature firework of grime and neon reflection. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale beer, cheap cigarettes, and something faintly metallic that Elias Finch, head bartender and self-proclaimed guardian of lost souls, couldn't quite place.  

Elias leaned against the chipped mahogany bar, polishing a glass absentmindedly. His movements were practiced and slow, mirroring the languid waltz of blues music spilling from the ancient jukebox tucked in the corner. Outside, the city groaned under the weight of another sleepless night, but inside The Last Call, time seemed to move differently - slower, heavier, steeped in the bittersweet memories held within its cracked leather booths and faded photographs. 

Tonight, however, the usual melancholy hum was punctuated by a jarring dissonance â€“ a figure slumped at the far end of the bar, shrouded in shadows so deep they seemed to swallow the light. Elias squinted, recognizing the silhouette despite the gloom. He knew that hunched back, those shoulders perpetually burdened with unseen weight. It was Silas Blackwood, a man who rarely spoke, even rarer to smile, and whose presence carried the unsettling scent of secrets best left buried.
