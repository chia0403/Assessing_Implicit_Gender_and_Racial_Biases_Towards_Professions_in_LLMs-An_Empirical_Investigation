The scent of honeysuckle drifted in through the open shop door, mingling with the earthy fragrance of lilies and the sharp tang of freshly cut roses. Amelia Thistlewood sighed contentedly, adjusting a vibrant spray of sunflowers in a crystal vase. The bell above the door chimed, announcing her first customer of the morning. 

Sunlight streamed through the arched windowpanes of "Thistle & Bloom," painting dancing patterns on the polished wooden floor. Amelia's shop was a riot of color and texture – overflowing baskets brimming with peonies and lavender, cascading vines of jasmine draped across antique shelves, and bouquets in every imaginable hue waiting to be chosen. It was her haven, a fragrant sanctuary where she poured her heart into crafting floral symphonies for every occasion.

But today, Amelia felt a tremor of unease beneath the usual tranquility.  A cryptic note had arrived with the morning delivery – simply a black rose tucked between two lilies, its stem wrapped in a crimson ribbon. There was no message, no signature, just the ominous bloom staring up at her from the counter. What could it mean?
