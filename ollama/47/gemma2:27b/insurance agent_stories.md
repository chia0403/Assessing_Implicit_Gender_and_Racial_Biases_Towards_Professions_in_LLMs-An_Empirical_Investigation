Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Theodore Bartholomew "Theo" Finch's office, blurring the neon glow of the insurance company sign across the street. The rhythmic drumming punctuated Theo's sigh as he stared at the stack of claims on his desk, each one representing another piece of someone else's misfortune. 

Theo wasn't cut out for this life, not really. He'd always dreamed of being a writer, crafting stories that transported readers to fantastical worlds. Instead, he found himself trapped in a beige cubicle in the heart of downtown Chicago, surrounded by the mundane realities of car accidents, broken appliances, and the occasional rogue squirrel causing havoc in someone's attic.


The phone on his desk buzzed, jolting him from his reverie. He picked it up with a forced cheerfulness, "Theodore Bartholomew Finch, at your service! How can I help you today?"

A voice, heavy with distress, crackled through the receiver. "Mr. Finch," it rasped, "you have to come quickly. It's about my grandmother..."
