The midday sun hammered down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck, turning his already sweat-soaked collar into a soggy mess. He squinted through the glare bouncing off the chrome scaffolding that rose precariously above him, a skeletal behemoth against the cloudless Arizona sky. The air vibrated with the insistent drone of jackhammers and the clatter of tools being tossed between burly men.

Eli wiped his forehead with the back of his calloused hand, leaving a streak of grime across his brow. He was perched precariously on a steel beam, wrestling with a recalcitrant piece of rebar that refused to fit into its designated slot. Frustration gnawed at him, a familiar companion on these sweltering summer days. This new skyscraper project, the Pinnacle Tower, was proving to be a real beast. Every angle seemed wrong, every measurement off by a hair's breadth.

But Eli wouldn't quit. He never did. He'd learned that lesson early in life, growing up in the shadow of his father's failing carpentry business. Hard work and grit were the only things he could truly rely on.  He hefted the rebar again, feeling the weight settle into his palms. This time, with a grunt of effort and a twist of his wrist, it slotted perfectly into place. A sliver of satisfaction cut through his frustration.

Just then, a shadow fell across the beam. Eli looked up to see a figure silhouetted against the sun, tall and lean with dark hair that whipped in the desert wind. It was Jasper Hayes, the site foreman, his face etched with lines of perpetual concern. "Blackwood," he called out, his voice gruff but laced with something akin to respect. "We need you on the ground floor. There's been an incident."


Eli's gut clenched. An incident. What did that mean?  He secured his tools and carefully climbed down the scaffolding, a sense of foreboding creeping up his spine. He had a feeling this wasn't going to be just another day on the job.
