The rusted swing set groaned under the weight of the late afternoon sun, its chains singing a mournful song as they swayed in the gentle breeze. Bartholomew Thistlewick, his weathered face crinkled in concentration, knelt amongst the overgrown rose bushes, meticulously pruning away dead blooms with shears older than himself.  The air hung heavy with the sweet scent of decaying petals and damp earth - a familiar perfume that Bartholomew found strangely comforting. The sprawling grounds of Willow Creek Manor were his domain, a tangled tapestry of forgotten gardens, crumbling statues, and whispering trees. For thirty years, he had been the silent guardian of this once-grand estate, tending to its wounds with unwavering devotion even as it slowly succumbed to the relentless grip of time.


Today, however, something felt different. A shiver danced down Bartholomew's spine, a prickling sensation that had nothing to do with the chill autumn air. It started subtly, a faint rustling in the hedge maze, an unsettling silence from the usually chattering sparrows. Then came the dreams â€“ vivid visions of a woman cloaked in moonlight, her eyes pools of shimmering silver, pleading for Bartholomew's help. He dismissed them at first, chalked it up to old age and too much chamomile tea. But as the days passed, the dreams grew more insistent, culminating in a terrifying premonition: danger was coming to Willow Creek Manor.
