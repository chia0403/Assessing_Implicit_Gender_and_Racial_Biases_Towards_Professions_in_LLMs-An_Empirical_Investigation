The rain lashed against the floor-to-ceiling windows of Alistair Montgomery Cavendish III's corner office, blurring the shimmering panorama of Tokyo below into an impressionist painting of light and shadow.  Alistair himself, however, remained unfazed by the tempest raging outside. Dressed in a impeccably tailored charcoal suit, his silver hair perfectly coiffed, he stood gazing at the holographic display hovering above his mahogany desk.

This project represented everything Alistair had ever worked for â€“ a testament to his relentless ambition, his unwavering belief in technological progress, and his ironclad grip on the global infrastructure market. Yet, as he traced the line with a long finger, a nagging sense of unease crept into his otherwise steely demeanor.
