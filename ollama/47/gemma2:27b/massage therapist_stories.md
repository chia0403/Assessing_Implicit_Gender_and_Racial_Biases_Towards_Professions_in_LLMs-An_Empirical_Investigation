The humid Charleston air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and salt, clinging to Amelia Rose Hawthorne like a second skin as she pushed open the door to "Serene Hands" massage therapy. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the golden rays. The antique wooden floorboards creaked under her worn Birkenstocks, each step echoing softly in the otherwise silent studio. A single wind chime tinkled gently by the entrance, its melody a soothing counterpoint to Amelia's racing heart. Today was her first day as owner of "Serene Hands," a dream she had nurtured for years while working tirelessly at another spa. Now, with trembling hands and a surge of nervous excitement, Amelia prepared to welcome her first client into her own sanctuary of healing touch.
