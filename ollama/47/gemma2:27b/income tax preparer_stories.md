The flickering fluorescent lights hummed an incessant tune above Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's head, casting harsh shadows across the cluttered desk in her cramped home office.  Stacks of W-2s and 1099s threatened to topple over, their white edges yellowed with age and stress. Outside, the relentless Arizona sun beat down on the adobe walls of her Tucson bungalow, turning the air inside thick and stifling. Esme pushed a stray curl behind her ear, her forehead already slick with sweat despite the whirring ceiling fan struggling to circulate the stale air. Tax season was in full swing, and her phone wouldn't stop buzzing with frantic clients desperate for last-minute help.

Tonight, however, it wasn't just numbers and deductions weighing on Esme's mind. A letter lay face down on her desk, its crisp white envelope mocking her with its official seal. It contained the news she'd been dreading: her father was ill, his health deteriorating faster than anyone had anticipated. He lived hundreds of miles away in a tiny New Mexico village, and Esme knew she couldn't put off visiting him any longer. But leaving during the busiest time of year felt like abandoning ship, leaving her clients adrift in a sea of forms and deadlines.
