The rooster's crow pierced through Elara Blackwood's sleep like a rusty nail hammered into wood. Groaning, she burrowed deeper into the patchwork quilt, willing herself back to the dream she'd been having - one filled with rolling hills of golden wheat and plump blueberries bursting with sweetness.  But the insistent clucking outside her window was no match for reality.

Elara threw off the covers, a chill snaking up her spine despite the humid July air clinging to the farmhouse walls. Dawn hadn't yet broken over Blackwood Farm, but she could already hear the familiar symphony of farm life: the lowing of cows from the barn, the rustling of chickens in their coop, and the rhythmic thrumming of cicadas greeting the day. 

Stepping out onto the worn wooden porch, Elara inhaled deeply. The air was thick with the earthy scent of freshly turned soil and the sweetness of ripening peaches wafting from the orchard across the field.  The sky was awash in pale hues of lavender and rose, promising another scorching summer day. Her weathered hands instinctively reached for the brim of her straw hat, a familiar ritual before facing the demands of the farm she'd inherited from her grandfather.
