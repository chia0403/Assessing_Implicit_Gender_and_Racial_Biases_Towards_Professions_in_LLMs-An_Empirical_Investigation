Rain lashed against the grand arched windows of The Grand Majestic Hotel, blurring the neon glow of the city below. Eleanor Cartwright, Chief Concierge of the establishment for almost twenty years, watched it all with a practiced eye. Her crisp white uniform was immaculate despite the evening's downpour.  Her auburn hair, always meticulously styled, was tucked away in a neat bun, not a single strand out of place. 

Eleanor surveyed the opulent lobby, her domain. Polished marble floors gleamed under the warm chandeliers, and plush velvet chairs beckoned weary travellers to rest. A crackling fire roared in the grand hearth, casting dancing shadows across the walls adorned with priceless artwork. The air hummed with the soft melodies of a string quartet tucked away in a corner.  

Tonight, however, the usual symphony of clinking glasses and hushed conversations was punctuated by an unsettling silence. Eleanor's sharp gaze darted towards the imposing oak doors leading to the hotel's private elevators. A guest was late. An exceptionally important guest.
