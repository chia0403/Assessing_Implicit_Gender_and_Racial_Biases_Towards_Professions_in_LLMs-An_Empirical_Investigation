The late afternoon light was already fading, casting long, skeletal shadows across the worn Persian rug and leather armchairs that adorned the room. Eleanor sat rigidly behind her mahogany desk, her brow furrowed as she stared intently at a file folder labelled "Patient X."

Their sessions were laced with cryptic metaphors and veiled threats, leaving Eleanor questioning her own sanity. Was she dealing with a deeply disturbed individual, or was there something more sinister at play? 


The insistent ringing of the phone shattered the silence, jolting Eleanor back to reality. Hesitantly, she picked up the receiver, bracing herself for whatever news awaited.
