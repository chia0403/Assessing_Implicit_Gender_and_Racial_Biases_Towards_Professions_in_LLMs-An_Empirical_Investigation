The humid air hung heavy in the barbershop, thick with the scent of bay rum and talcum powder. Sunlight, fractured by the grimy windowpane, painted squares of dust onto the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the cacophony of 1950s Harlem - hawkers yelling, horns blaring, music spilling from open doorways - faded into a dull roar behind the closed door.

Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, his brow furrowed in concentration, expertly navigated the curves and angles of Mr. Johnson's head with his razor. Bart's hands moved with a practiced grace honed over decades, each stroke precise and efficient. He knew every bump, dip, and line on the faces that came through his door. In this small world carved out within the bustling city, he was more than just a barber; he was a confidante, a therapist, a witness to the lives unfolding around him. 


Today, however, Bart's mind wasn't fully present. A knot of worry tightened in his chest. His daughter, Evelyn, hadn't come home last night, and every passing hour amplified his fear. He stole glances at the clock on the wall, each tick another agonizing reminder of her absence.
