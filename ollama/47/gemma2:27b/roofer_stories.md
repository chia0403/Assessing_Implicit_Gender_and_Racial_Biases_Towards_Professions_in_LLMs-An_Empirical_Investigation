The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the smell of pine sap and distant thunderstorms. Elias "Eli" Blackwood wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, squinting up at the unforgiving sun beating down on the slanted roof of the dilapidated farmhouse. Shingles lay scattered around him like discarded puzzle pieces, each one shimmering under the relentless heat. The wind rustled through the ancient oaks lining the property, whispering tales of forgotten summers and creaking like old bones. Eli gripped his hammer tighter, the worn leather handle familiar in his palm. He'd been a roofer for longer than he cared to remember, finding solace in the rhythm of hammering and the steady climb towards the sky. But today, something felt different. A nagging unease prickled at the back of his neck as he surveyed the weathered shingles, each one telling a story of time and neglect. This job wasn't just about fixing a roof; it was about uncovering secrets hidden beneath layers of decay.
