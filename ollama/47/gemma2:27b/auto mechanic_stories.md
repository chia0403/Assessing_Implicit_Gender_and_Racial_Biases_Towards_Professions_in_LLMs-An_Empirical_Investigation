The air in Jasper "Jazz" Delaney's garage hung thick with the scent of motor oil, gasoline, and desperation.  Rust-colored light filtered through the grime-coated windows, illuminating a tableau of half-dismantled engines and greasy tools scattered across workbenches. Jazz, a man built like a linebacker with hands that could coax life back into even the most stubborn carburetor, wiped sweat from his brow with a rag stained a rainbow of engine fluids. 

Outside, the midday sun beat down on the dusty lot in Harmony Creek, Nevada â€“ a town where time seemed to move slower than molasses on a cold day. Jazz glanced at the clock on the wall, its hands frozen at 1:47.  He wasn't sure if it was broken or just mirroring the stagnation he felt. Business had been slow lately, and the bills were piling up like discarded pistons in a forgotten engine block.

Just then, a battered pickup truck sputtered into the lot, kicking up a cloud of dust that settled on Jazz's already grimy overalls. A young woman with fiery red hair and eyes as green as emeralds hopped out, her face etched with anxiety.  Jazz felt a flicker of hope. Maybe this was the break he needed.
