It seemed to be coming from the locked door at the end of the hall â€“ a door she had never dared to open. A shiver ran down her spine.  Her grandmother had always warned her about that room, muttering something about secrets best left buried. But tonight, driven by an inexplicable urge, Eliza found herself drawn towards the forbidden doorway.
