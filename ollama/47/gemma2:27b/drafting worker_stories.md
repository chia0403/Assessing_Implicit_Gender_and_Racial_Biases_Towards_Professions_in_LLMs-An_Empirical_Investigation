Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of the drafters' shed, a relentless tattoo that mirrored the thrumming anxiety in Elara Blackwood's chest. The air hung thick with the smell of graphite and stale coffee, punctuated by the occasional sharp click of her mechanical pencil as she meticulously traced lines onto the translucent vellum.

The sprawling shipyards of Port Haven sprawled beyond the shed windows, a labyrinth of towering cranes, hulking hulls under construction, and the ceaseless activity of men hauling timber and iron. Elara's world, however, was confined to the two-foot square drafting table before her. 

Today's assignment was crucial: a detailed cross-section of the new airship design, "The Leviathan". It was a project whispered about in hushed tones, rumored to be the fastest, most advanced vessel ever conceived. Elara knew her work would be scrutinized by the renowned Master Shipwright himself, and the thought sent shivers down her spine.

But as she stared at the intricate network of lines representing the airship's internal framework, a sense of purpose surged through her. This wasn't just a job; it was a chance to contribute to something extraordinary, to leave her mark on the future of aerial travel. The rain continued its relentless assault, but Elara barely noticed.  She had a leviathan to build.
