The air hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary, a peculiar blend that Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick considered both comforting and invigorating. Dawn was just breaking over Thistlewick's Butchers, casting long shadows across the cobblestone street and painting the stained-glass windows in hues of ruby and amethyst. Bart ran a calloused hand through his greying beard, surveying the rows of glistening carcasses hanging from hooks, their pale flesh catching the nascent light. Today, he was expecting a special delivery: a wild boar, hunted by Lord Ashworth himself, destined to grace the table of the Duke's upcoming feast. 

Bart adjusted his blood-stained apron, anticipation tingling in his fingers. This wasn't just any butchering job. It was an opportunity to showcase his skill, to etch his name into the annals of Thistlewick Butchers alongside generations past. He inhaled deeply, the scent of rosemary momentarily masking the coppery tang of blood, and squared his shoulders. Today would be a day for legends.
