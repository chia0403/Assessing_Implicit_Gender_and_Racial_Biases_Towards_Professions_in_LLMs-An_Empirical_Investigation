The fluorescent lights hummed above Elara Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of empty desks in the BioTech Solutions lab. The scent of disinfectant mingled with a faint metallic tang â€“ the lingering ghost of last week's botched experiment, whispered Elara's supervisor, Mr. Henderson. 

Elara ran a damp cloth over a stainless steel countertop, her movements practiced and efficient. In the stillness of the late evening, the lab felt eerily alive. The whirring of ventilation fans mingled with the distant clink of beakers in the washing room, creating an unsettling symphony. Outside the panoramic windows, the city lights blurred into an incandescent haze, reflecting off the polished floor and making Elara feel strangely adrift.

Tonight, however, something was different. A prickling unease crawled beneath her skin as she approached a darkened corner lab. The door was slightly ajar, emitting a soft, rhythmic hum that wasn't part of the usual lab symphony.
