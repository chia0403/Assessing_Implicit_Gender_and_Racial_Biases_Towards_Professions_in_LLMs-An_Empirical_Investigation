Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Croft's clinic, mirroring the turmoil in her own chest. The normally cheerful yellow walls seemed to dim under the onslaught of grey, and even the chirping finches in their cage by the window sounded melancholy.  She glanced at the clock â€“ 3:17 am.  Another sleepless night. 

Amelia ran a hand through her already dishevelled auburn braid. The weight of responsibility for all the creatures entrusted to her care pressed down on her, amplified by the relentless storm raging outside.  Tonight's emergency was particularly unsettling - a frantic call from Mrs. Henderson about her beloved Persian cat, Mittens, who had suddenly stopped eating and was lethargic.

Amelia sighed. Mrs. Henderson lived miles out in the countryside, reachable only by treacherous dirt roads that were likely impassable in this weather. Yet, Amelia couldn't bear the thought of leaving a sick animal unattended. She knew she wouldn't rest until she saw Mittens for herself. Grabbing her trusty rain jacket and headlamp, she steeled herself for the journey ahead.
