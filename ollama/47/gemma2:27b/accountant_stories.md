Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Theodore "Teddy" Bartholomew's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his chest. The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. Spread across Teddy's desk lay a tangled mess of receipts, invoices, and bank statements – the financial wreckage of "Bartholomew's Bakery," his family's business for three generations.

Teddy, a man whose meticulously-kept hair mirrored the order he craved in his life, felt a tremor run through him. This wasn't just about numbers anymore; it was about legacy, about the warm smell of fresh bread wafting from the oven every morning, and the comforting clatter of trays being loaded onto shelves – sights and sounds that had filled his childhood. Now, faced with mounting debt and dwindling profits, Teddy knew he had to make a choice: save the bakery or watch his family's dream crumble into dust.
