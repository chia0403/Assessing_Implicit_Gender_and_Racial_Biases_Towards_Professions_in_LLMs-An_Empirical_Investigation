The wind whipped across the plains, biting at Elias "Eli" Blackwood's weathered face as he squinted towards the horizon. The sun, a molten ball sinking towards the jagged peaks of the Blue Mountains, cast long shadows across his sprawling ranch. Dust devils danced in the distance, their ephemeral forms mocking the stark reality of the drought that had gripped Montana for months. Eli adjusted the brim of his Stetson, a frown etching deeper lines into his already weathered face.

The once-lush pastures were now brittle and brown, dotted with skeletal cattle struggling to find sustenance. The creek that snaked through his property, once teeming with trout, was reduced to a muddy trickle.  Eli's calloused hands tightened around the reins of his paint mare, Belle, her ears flicking nervously at the mournful cry of a hawk circling overhead. He knew he had to make a decision, and soon. His livelihood, his legacy – everything he held dear – hung in the balance.
