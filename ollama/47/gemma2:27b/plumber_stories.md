The incessant dripping was driving Alistair Bartholomew Finch III up the wall – literally.  It echoed through the cramped bathroom he was trying to renovate, each drop an accusatory tap against the rusty old pipes. Alistair wasn't known for his patience, and today it had evaporated entirely along with the last of his lukewarm coffee. He glared at the offending faucet, its chrome dulled by years of hard water and neglect. "Just give me a break," he muttered to the offending fixture, "I've already wrestled three angry raccoons out of Mrs. Henderson's attic this week."

The bathroom was tucked away in the bowels of an aging Victorian mansion on Elm Street – a testament to the city's fading grandeur. Dust motes danced in the pale sunlight filtering through grimy windows, illuminating peeling wallpaper and cobwebs thick enough to snare a small bird. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and something vaguely floral, like forgotten potpourri.  Alistair tugged at his grease-stained overalls, wishing he'd listened to his mother and become a lawyer instead.

But then again, lawyers didn't get to unearth dusty treasures hidden behind crumbling walls or decipher the intricate language of aging plumbing systems. And sometimes, just sometimes, they got to meet interesting people – like the reclusive owner of this mansion, who Alistair was yet to lay eyes on.
