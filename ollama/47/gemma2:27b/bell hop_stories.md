The Grand Astoria hummed with a frantic energy that only came alive at 4:00 pm.  Sunlight slanted through the arched windows of the lobby, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and glinting off the polished brass luggage carts. Bartholomew "Bart" Quincy adjusted his burgundy bellhop cap, already feeling the familiar ache in his shoulders. A dozen weary travelers milled about, clutching suitcases that threatened to burst with souvenirs and anxieties.  The smell of stale perfume and desperation hung heavy in the air. Bart sighed, bracing himself for the onslaught. He might not have been a prince, but within these gilded walls, he was king of chaos, master of mountains of luggage, and keeper of countless secrets whispered between hushed breaths. 


Today, however, promised to be different. A ripple of excitement had travelled through the staff - a renowned inventor, Professor Alistair Finchley, was checking in. Bart had heard whispers of Finchley's latest creation: a clockwork automaton capable of mimicking human speech and movement with unnerving accuracy. The thought sent shivers down Bart's spine. He imagined meeting this mechanical marvel, perhaps even learning its secrets.  He glanced at the imposing oak doors, his heart pounding in anticipation. Today was no ordinary day at the Grand Astoria.
