The aroma of warm cinnamon and caramelized sugar drifted out of The Rolling Pin Bakery, mingling with the salty tang of the sea air that whipped in off the Cornish coast.  Inside, Amelia "Amy" Trelawney hummed along to the radio, her flour-dusted hands deftly shaping croissants. She loved this time of day, the quiet solitude before the shop doors swung open and the bustle of customers began. Outside, the fishing village of Port Isaac was waking up â€“ fishermen mending their nets, gulls squawking overhead, the distant clang of the harbor bell.

Amy glanced at the clock on the wall. Nearly 7:00 am. Time to light the ovens and get the sourdough loaves ready for baking. Today promised to be a busy one; it was market day, and she'd already received a hefty order from Mrs. Henderson, who ran the local tea room and swore by Amy's scones.
