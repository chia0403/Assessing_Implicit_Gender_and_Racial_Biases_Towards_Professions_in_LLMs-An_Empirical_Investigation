The neon sign outside The Rusty Mic flickered erratically, casting Amelia "Amy" Rose's face in an unsettling strobe effect. She adjusted her battered fedora, trying to shield her eyes from the harsh light. Rain lashed down on the cobbled street, turning it into a slick mirror reflecting the city's grimy underbelly. A chorus of honking horns and distant sirens provided the soundtrack to this urban symphony.

Amy clutched her worn guitar case tighter, its faded leather cold against her palm. Tonight was crucial. The Rusty Mic was known for its discerning crowd â€“ jaded musicians, cynical critics, and a smattering of hopeful dreamers like herself. It was the kind of place where a voice could soar or be swallowed whole. Amy was determined to make hers heard.
