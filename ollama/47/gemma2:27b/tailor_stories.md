Rain hammered against the shop window, blurring the gaslights into hazy orbs. Inside, Elias Finch adjusted the fit of a waistcoat on his customer, a portly gentleman with a handlebar mustache that quivered with every disapproving sniff.

Elias sighed inwardly. Business had been slow lately, the relentless drizzle reflecting the bleakness settling over his heart.
