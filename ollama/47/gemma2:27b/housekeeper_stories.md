Rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Blackwood Manor, each drop a tiny fist pounding on the ancient panes. Amelia Thistlewick, her silver braid swinging with every exasperated sigh, wrestled with a stubborn stain on the Persian rug in the grand foyer.

Inside, shadowy corridors stretched endlessly, echoing with whispers of forgotten secrets and lingering sorrow. Amelia, a woman who preferred the comforting predictability of dust bunnies to the unsettling mysteries of Blackwood Manor, yearned for the day she could retire her worn cleaning cloths and return to her cozy cottage by the sea.
