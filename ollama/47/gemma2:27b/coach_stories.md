The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the dusty baseball diamond, painting the infield a sickly shade of yellow. The air hung heavy with humidity, punctuated by the shrill cries of cicadas hidden in the overgrown foliage beyond the outfield fence. A lone figure, hunched over a battered clipboard, paced along the third base line, muttering to himself. This was Theodore "Teddy" Callahan, head coach of the struggling Mudville Marauders.  

His weathered face, etched with lines from years spent under the harsh glare of summer suns, reflected his frustration. Another loss. Another game where his boys couldn't seem to string together a decent inning, let alone a winning streak. Teddy loved these kids – their raw talent, their unwavering enthusiasm – but something was missing. A spark. The fire that ignited champions. He just had to figure out how to light it.
