The rhythmic clattering of the typewriter was the only sound breaking the heavy silence of the office. It was 6:30 pm, and everyone else had long gone home, leaving Eleanor alone with the lingering scent of stale coffee and Mr. Hawthorne's cigar smoke.

Eleanor adjusted the lampshade, casting a warm glow on her desk piled high with files and correspondence. The mahogany surface gleamed under the light, reflecting the anxious flutter in her chest. Tomorrow was the day. After years of diligently serving as Mr. Hawthorne's secretary, she was finally ready to present him with her proposal - a bold plan to modernize the company's outdated marketing strategies.
