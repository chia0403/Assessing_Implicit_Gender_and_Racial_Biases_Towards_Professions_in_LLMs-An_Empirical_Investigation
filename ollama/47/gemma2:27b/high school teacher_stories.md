The bell shrieked its midday chorus, releasing Eleanor Cavendish's tenth-grade English class into the chaotic churn of lunchtime. Papers fluttered to the linoleum floor like frantic pigeons, backpacks thumped against lockers with the force of tiny earthquakes, and the air vibrated with a symphony of adolescent chatter.  Eleanor watched them go, a weary smile tugging at her lips. She loved these kids, she truly did, but sometimes their boundless energy felt like a tidal wave threatening to drown her.

Leaning back in her creaky chair, Eleanor surveyed her domain: Room 217, a faded beige rectangle smelling faintly of chalk dust and teenage angst. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows, illuminating rows of desks scarred with years of pencil scribbles and chewed-up erasers. A tattered poster of Shakespeare, its edges curling like autumn leaves, hung precariously above the blackboard, a testament to the countless dramas Eleanor had helped her students unravel over the years. 

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced on Eleanor's skin. It wasn't just the usual end-of-semester exhaustion; this was a deeper, more unsettling feeling.  As she reached for her coffee mug, its familiar weight suddenly felt foreign in her hand.  A shiver snaked down her spine, and she knew, with a certainty that defied logic, that something momentous was about to happen.
