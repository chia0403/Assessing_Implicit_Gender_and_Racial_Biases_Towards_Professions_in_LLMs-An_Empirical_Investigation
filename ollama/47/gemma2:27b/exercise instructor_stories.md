The humid Florida air clung to Beatrice "Bea" Alvarez like a second skin as she bounced on her toes, waiting for the Zumba class to begin. Her playlist thumped through the speakers, a mix of Latin rhythms and pop anthems designed to energize even the most reluctant participant. The mirrored walls of the community center gym reflected Bea's infectious grin, her brightly colored workout clothes practically vibrating with enthusiasm.

Bea wasn't just an exercise instructor; she was a motivator, a cheerleader, a dispenser of high-fives and pep talks. She believed fitness was more than sculpting muscles â€“ it was about building confidence, forging connections, and unleashing joy. Today, though, a shadow lurked beneath her effervescent exterior. A cryptic note tucked into her mailbox that morning had shaken her to the core, its anonymous message promising "a reckoning" if she didn't stop pushing her clients so hard.

Was it a cruel prank? A jealous rival? Or something far more sinister? As the first participants trickled in, their faces expectant and hopeful, Bea wrestled with a growing unease. The music pulsed, beckoning them to move, but a chilling premonition whispered: maybe this Zumba class wouldn't be just about fitness. Maybe it would be about survival.
