The sticky sweet smell of maple syrup hung heavy in the air, a sugary fog that clung to Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's apron like a second skin.  It was 8:00 AM on a Saturday, prime time for hungry families at "Betsy's Buttercup Cafe," a kitschy diner with checkered floors and enough plastic flowers to rival a greenhouse.

Amelia, her fiery red hair escaping its haphazard bun, expertly navigated the crowded floor, balancing a tower of pancakes high above her head.  She dodged giggling children, sidestepped businessmen glued to their phones, and deftly avoided a poodle trying to sniff out dropped bacon. 


This was Amelia's world: a whirlwind of bottomless coffee, greasy spoons, and endless orders of "sunny-side up with extra crispy bacon." It wasn't glamorous, but it paid the bills – barely – and provided enough quirky characters to fill her notebook for her aspiring writer career.  Today, though, something felt different. A restless energy buzzed beneath Amelia's skin, a feeling that something unusual was about to happen, right here in Betsy's Buttercup Cafe.
