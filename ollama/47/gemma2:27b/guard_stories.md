The wind whipped across the desolate plains of Aethel, biting at Elias Thorne's exposed face and tugging insistently at his threadbare cloak. Above him, the sky was an endless expanse of bruised purple, mirroring the tumultuous emotions churning within him. He stood stoic, however, his weathered hand gripping the haft of his spear as he scanned the horizon for any sign of movement.

Elias was a guard stationed at the crumbling remnants of Fort Aegis, once a bastion of civilization against the relentless tide of shadow creatures that roamed Aethel. Now, it was a lonely outpost, its walls cracked and overgrown with thorny vines, a testament to the empire's waning grip on these untamed lands. 

He wasn't sure how much longer they could hold out. Supplies were dwindling, and rumors of a massive shadow horde gathering in the north sent chills down his spine.  His comrades - weary veterans like himself - muttered about abandoning the fort altogether, seeking refuge in the overcrowded cities to the south. But Elias couldn't bring himself to leave.


This was his post, his duty. As long as there was a flicker of hope, he would stand guard against the encroaching darkness.
