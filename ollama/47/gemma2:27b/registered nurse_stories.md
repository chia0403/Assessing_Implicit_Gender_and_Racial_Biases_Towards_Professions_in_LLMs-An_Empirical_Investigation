Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mimicking the erratic thudding of Amelia Grace Hawthorne’s heart. She gripped the cold metal railing outside the ICU, her nursing shoes squeaking on the linoleum floor as she nervously paced.  Inside, Mr. Henderson, a frail man with eyes like faded denim, lay tethered to machines that beeped and whirred like anxious orchestra members. He was Amelia's patient, and his condition had taken a sudden, terrifying turn. His once-steady breaths now came in shallow gasps, and the green line on the monitor tracking his oxygen levels flickered precariously.

Amelia had always been drawn to the intensity of ICU nursing, but tonight, fear gnawed at her. She’d done everything she could – adjusted the ventilator settings, administered medication, called for a senior nurse - yet Mr. Henderson continued to slip away.
