Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Eleanor Ainsworth's cramped office, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her.  Her fingers tapped impatiently on the worn surface of her desk, a symphony of frustration punctuated by the rhythmic drip from a leaky faucet. Outside, the neon sign of "Sunrise Nutrition" blinked forlornly, its cheerful yellow light a cruel mockery in the face of Eleanor's growing despair.

Eleanor Ainsworth, RD, was at her wit's end. Her dream job - helping people achieve healthy lifestyles through personalized dietary plans - had morphed into a soul-crushing struggle for survival. Business was slow, bills were piling up, and she felt like she was drowning in a sea of unsweetened almond milk and kale smoothies.

The phone on her desk remained stubbornly silent, amplifying the emptiness that echoed within her small office.  Eleanor sighed, gazing at the framed diplomas proudly displayed on the wall â€“ testaments to years of hard work and unwavering dedication. 


What was she doing wrong?
