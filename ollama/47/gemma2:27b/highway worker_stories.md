The sun beat down on Silas Bartholomew's back like a blacksmith's hammer, making the sweat sting in his eyes. The asphalt shimmered in waves of heat haze, blurring the endless ribbon of highway that stretched before him. His boots crunched on the gravel shoulder as he hauled another orange cone, its plastic dented and faded, adding it to the line marking the lane closure ahead. 

Silas squinted at the horizon, a hazy smudge of purple mountains barely visible through the sun-baked air. This stretch of Interstate 40 was notorious: desolate, dusty, and prone to sudden desert storms that could turn the landscape into a swirling vortex of sand in minutes. It wasn't glamorous work, but it paid the bills, and Silas had come to find a strange solace in the monotonous rhythm of his days â€“ filling potholes, setting signs, and directing traffic.  Today, though, something felt different. A prickling unease, like a desert wind whispering warnings he couldn't decipher.
