Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of the diner, each drop a tiny explosion echoing through the near-empty space. Beatrice "Bea" Fontaine stared out the greasy window, watching the blurry streetlights cast sickly yellow halos on the slick asphalt. She swirled the lukewarm coffee in her chipped mug, wishing it was something stronger.  

Bea hadn't closed a deal in weeks. The once vibrant energy that pulsed through her veins when she presented her line of artisanal soaps – scents like "Midnight Bloom" and "Forest Nymph" – had fizzled into a dull ache of doubt. Today’s pitch to the upscale boutique owner had been disastrous, ending with a curt “Not interested” and a dismissive wave of his manicured hand.

Now, she sat in this greasy spoon diner on the outskirts of Asheville, North Carolina, trying to figure out her next move. Maybe it was time to ditch the soaps altogether and find something more practical, something people actually *needed*.  But what? The thought sent a shiver through Bea, a chilling premonition that maybe, just maybe, she wasn't cut out for this whole "selling" thing after all.
