The salty air whipped Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's fiery red hair across her face as she stood on the windswept cliffs overlooking the craggy coastline. Below, the turquoise waves crashed against jagged rocks, sending plumes of white spray high into the air. This wasn't your typical real estate showing. Amy specialized in unique properties â€“ crumbling castles, abandoned lighthouses, and this: a breathtakingly dilapidated Victorian mansion perched precariously on the edge of the world.

The salty tang in the air mixed with the musty scent of decay emanating from the house itself. The once-grand facade was now peeling paint and fractured stone, the windows like vacant eyes staring out to sea. A sense of melancholy hung heavy over the property, a whisper of forgotten dreams and lost grandeur.


Amy took a deep breath, steeling herself for the challenge ahead. Selling this place wouldn't be easy. It needed a buyer with vision, someone who could see past the crumbling walls and overgrown gardens to the potential beauty within.
