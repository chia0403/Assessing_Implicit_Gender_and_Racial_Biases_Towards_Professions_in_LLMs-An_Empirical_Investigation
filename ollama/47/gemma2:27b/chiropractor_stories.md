Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Rosalind Cartwright's office, mimicking the relentless throb behind her left temple. The flickering neon sign outside read "Cartwright Chiropractic: Align Your Life," but tonight, it felt more like a mocking taunt than an invitation.  

Evelyn sighed, pushing away the stack of patient files cluttering her desk. She wasn't supposed to be working this late; she'd promised herself a quiet evening with a good book and a steaming cup of chamomile tea. But then Mrs. Henderson, Evelynâ€™s eighty-year-old neighbor who was as spry as a sparrow despite her age, had tripped on the uneven sidewalk and landed squarely on her hip.

Evelyn's small practice sat tucked away on a side street in the heart of Willow Creek, a quaint town nestled amidst rolling hills and whispering pines. The air usually smelled of pine needles and freshly baked bread, but tonight, it was heavy with the metallic tang of rain. 


The phone chirped, startling Evelyn from her musings. It was Mrs. Henderson's daughter, frantic and worried. Evelyn knew she couldn't say no.  Grabbing her coat, she steeled herself for a night of adjusting fractured bones and calming anxious minds. In Willow Creek, the chiropractor didn't just fix backs; they fixed lives.
