The air in the quarry hung thick with dust, fine as powdered bone and just as pervasive.  Elias Blackwood coughed, the sound swallowed by the rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel. Sunlight slanted down through the narrow gap between two sheer rock faces, illuminating a cloud of glittering particles that danced and swirled like a miniature galaxy. Elias squinted, wiping sweat from his brow with a calloused hand. He was carving another gargoyle for the cathedral spire, this one meant to ward off storms.

The stone itself was a beautiful grey-green slate, flecked with veins of quartz that shimmered like trapped lightning. Elias loved working with it, relishing the way the chisel bit into its surface, revealing hidden patterns and textures. Each stroke was an act of creation, a slow unveiling of the beauty hidden within the rough, unyielding mass. 

But today, even the familiar rhythm and satisfaction of his work couldn't quell the unease that gnawed at him. He had heard whispers amongst the other quarrymen â€“ tales of strange lights seen flickering on the mountainside at night, ghostly voices carried on the wind, and a palpable sense of dread settling over the village. Elias dismissed them as superstition at first, but lately, even he couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.

As he carved the gargoyle's stern visage, its granite eyes seemingly fixed on some distant threat, Elias swore he heard a faint whisper carried on the wind. It was barely audible, a sibilant rasping just beyond the reach of understanding. He paused, listening intently, but the sound vanished as quickly as it came. 

Elias shook his head, attributing the strange sensation to fatigue and the oppressive heat of the quarry. But deep down, a seed of doubt had been planted. Something was happening in these ancient hills, something beyond the realm of ordinary events.
