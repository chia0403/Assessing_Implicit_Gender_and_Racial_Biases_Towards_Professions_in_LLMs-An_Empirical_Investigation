The fluorescent lights of Mercy Hospital's lab hummed a monotonous tune that Eliza Cartwright had come to know intimately in her five years as a phlebotomist. The scent of antiseptic and something faintly metallic, always present in the air, clung to her scrubs like a second skin. Outside, the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in bruised shades of purple and orange. It was a beautiful sight Eliza rarely had time to appreciate.

Tonight, however, felt different. A prickle of unease danced along her spine as she double-checked the requisition forms for Mrs. Eleanor Hayes, an elderly patient admitted with unexplained fatigue. The order specified multiple vials of blood, more than usual for a routine check-up. Eliza frowned, glancing at the clock. It was almost closing time.

"Everything alright, Eliza?"  Nurse Johnson's voice broke through her contemplation.

Eliza forced a smile. "Just making sure I have everything for Mrs. Hayes. Seems like an extensive panel."


Nurse Johnson shrugged. "Doctors are being cautious these days. Best be thorough, I suppose."  She headed toward the exit. "See you tomorrow?"

Eliza nodded, but her gaze remained fixed on the requisition forms. Something about this case felt off, a discordant note in the usual symphony of lab work. As she prepared the needles and vials, a sense of foreboding settled over her, heavier than the sterile air around her.
