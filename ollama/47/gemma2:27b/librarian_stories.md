Rain lashed against the arched windows of the Blackwood Library, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the cobblestones outside. Eleanor Whitestone, her silver braid escaping its bun, peered through the cascading water at the shadowy figures hurrying past. 

The library, with its towering shelves and scent of aging paper, was Eleanor's sanctuary. It had been for decades, ever since she'd inherited it from her eccentric grandmother, a woman who believed stories held more power than any spell. Tonight, however, even the comforting weight of ancient tomes couldn't dispel the unease gnawing at Eleanor. A series of strange occurrences plagued the Blackwood Library â€“ whispers in empty aisles, books mysteriously rearranging themselves, and an unsettling chill that seemed to follow her every move. 

As a librarian, Eleanor prided herself on logic and reason. Yet, something whispered in the back of her mind, something ancient and primal, urging her to believe the impossible.
