The scent of linseed oil and turpentine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the salty tang drifting in from the harbor. Eliza Thorne-Whitby squinted through the glare reflecting off her easel, her brow furrowed in concentration. The sun dipped lower on the horizon, casting long shadows across the cobbled streets of Port Haven, painting the weathered facades of the fishermen's cottages in hues of burnt orange and dusky rose. Eliza's canvas mirrored this spectacle - a riotous explosion of colour capturing the chaotic beauty of the bustling harbor as fishing boats returned laden with their catch, gulls shrieked overhead, and children chased each other through the throngs of people. 


Eliza, with her unruly auburn curls escaping from her braid and paint splattered across her worn overalls, was a familiar sight in Port Haven. A lone wolf by nature, she preferred the company of her canvases to that of people, finding solace and inspiration in the ever-changing hues of the sea and sky.
