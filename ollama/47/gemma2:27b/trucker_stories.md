The air shimmered off the asphalt ribbon unfurling before him like a mirage. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking Ezekiel "Zeke" Holloway's thirst with their swirling, ephemeral grace. Zeke squinted, his weathered hand shielding his eyes from the relentless Arizona sun. The cab of his rig, affectionately nicknamed "Betty," hummed a steady symphony, a familiar comfort in the vast emptiness of the desert.  His CB radio crackled to life, a disembodied voice cutting through the static: "Breaker One-Nine, any long haulers out there headed east?" Zeke chuckled, his gravelly voice rumbling over the speaker, "This is Zeke, heading towards Flagstaff. Need somethin' hauled?" The silence that followed was punctuated only by Betty's engine and the mournful cry of a hawk circling overhead.

Zeke adjusted his Stetson, pushing back a stray strand of silver hair. He wasn't sure what he'd gotten himself into this time, hauling a mysterious cargo sealed in a reinforced trailer with more locks than Fort Knox. The client had been vague, paying handsomely in cash and insisting on anonymity. Zeke, ever the pragmatist with bills to pay and a wanderlust that wouldn't quit, hadn't questioned it much. But as the sun dipped lower, casting long shadows across the desolate landscape, a gnawing unease began to settle in his gut.
