The humid New Orleans air clung to Elara Dubois like a second skin as she hurried down Bourbon Street. Neon signs bled into one another, casting a kaleidoscope of colors on the slick cobblestone beneath her feet. The cacophony of drunken laughter, jazz music spilling from dimly lit bars, and the persistent thump of a nearby street performer's bass drum was almost overwhelming. Elara, though accustomed to the city's frenetic energy, felt an unfamiliar tightness in her chest. Today was unlike any other she'd faced during her time as a Physician Assistant at Charity Hospital.

Tonight, she wasn't heading towards the familiar bustle of the ER. Tonight, she was on her way to meet someone who held the key to a past Elara had desperately tried to forget.
