Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elias Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless pounding in his head. The air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale coffee, a familiar aroma that clung to him like a second skin. Outside, the neon glow of the "Starlight Lounge" sign flickered erratically, casting an eerie green light across the rain-slicked alleyway below. Elias Thorne, a man whose face bore the etchings of countless late nights and even later regrets, swiveled in his worn leather chair, the springs groaning under his weight.  He stared at the photograph clutched in his hand: a young woman with eyes the color of twilight, her smile frozen in time. Her name was Isabella Rossi, and she'd vanished without a trace three weeks ago.

The case had landed on Thorne's desk like a stray dog, hungry and wary. Isabella's brother, Marco, a man whose desperation clung to him like a shroud, had begged for Thorne's help. The police, according to Marco, weren't taking the disappearance seriously enough. 

Thorne wasn't known for his sentimentality. He dealt in facts, evidence, and the gritty truth that often lay buried beneath layers of deceit. But Isabella Rossi's case tugged at him, her vanished smile a haunting reminder of the innocence he'd long since abandoned.
