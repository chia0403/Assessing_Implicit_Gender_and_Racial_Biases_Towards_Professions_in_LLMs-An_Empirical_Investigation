The rusty whine of the Cessna 172's engine sliced through the pre-dawn stillness, echoing off the jagged peaks that ringed the remote Alaskan valley. Captain Alistair "Mac" McGregor gripped the yoke, his calloused fingers navigating the aircraft with practiced ease. Dawn was just beginning to paint the sky in hues of bruised purple and fiery orange as Mac steered the aging plane towards its destination - a tiny gravel airstrip nestled amidst towering spruce trees. 

The air smelled crisp and clean, laced with the sharp scent of pine needles and damp earth. Below him, the valley unfolded like a crumpled green blanket, dotted with glassy lakes reflecting the nascent sunlight. A wisp of smoke curled from the chimney of a lone cabin, a beacon in the vast wilderness. Mac's heart thumped with anticipation - this was his first solo delivery run to the remote outpost of Eagle Creek, and he was determined to make it count.
