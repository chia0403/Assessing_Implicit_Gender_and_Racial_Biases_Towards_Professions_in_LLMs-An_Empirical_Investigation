Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Smiles for Miles" Dental Hygiene, blurring the neon sign into an impressionistic smear of pink and blue. Inside, Eleanor Cartwright sighed, her forehead crinkling as she stared at the clock. It was 4:57 pm – three minutes until freedom. She tapped a chipped porcelain tooth on the counter with a rhythmic click-clack, her mind already drifting to the steaming mug of chamomile tea awaiting her in her cozy apartment.

Eleanor wasn't your typical dental hygienist. Beneath her crisp blue scrubs and perfectly coiffed bun hid a soul yearning for something more than plaque removal and flossing tutorials. She dreamt of dusty libraries, forgotten manuscripts, and uncovering ancient mysteries – anything but the relentless hum of the dental drill and the sickly sweet smell of disinfectant. Today, however, even the prospect of chamomile couldn't quell her unease.  A strange patient had called earlier that morning, requesting an appointment at the very last minute. Something about his voice, a low rasp laced with urgency, sent chills down Eleanor's spine.

As the clock ticked over to 5:00 pm, the door creaked open, revealing a silhouette shrouded in shadows.  Eleanor braced herself, her heart pounding against her ribs like a trapped bird. This was no ordinary patient.
