The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Juniper’s head, casting a sterile glow over the bustling pre-op waiting area. Outside, the Texas sun beat down mercilessly, but inside the hospital wing it was perpetually cool and faintly antiseptic.

She was adept at diverting attention, spinning tales about the marvels of the circulatory system, and finding the elusive vein with practiced ease. Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation ran down her spine, a feeling she couldn’t quite place.
