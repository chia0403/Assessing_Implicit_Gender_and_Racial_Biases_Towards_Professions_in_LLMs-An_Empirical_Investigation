The pungent aroma of disinfectant and damp fur hung thick in the air, punctuated by the occasional mew or woof from anxious patients.  Dr. Amelia Grace Hawthorne surveyed her bustling practice, "Heart & Paw," with a sigh. The morning had been a whirlwind of emergencies: a frantic chihuahua suffering from a suspected bee sting, a clumsy tabby who’d tangled himself in Christmas lights, and now, a German Shepherd with a broken leg.

Amelia’s small town clinic nestled on the outskirts of Willow Creek, a quaint community tucked away in the heart of Oregon's rolling hills, was always full of life, both furry and human.  Outside, the first snow flurries of winter were swirling, painting the world in a soft blanket of white, while inside, the warmth of Amelia’s worn leather armchair offered a brief respite from the chaos.  

Amelia leaned back, rubbing her temples with tired fingers. The day was young, and she knew it would only get busier. But beneath the fatigue, a familiar warmth bloomed in her chest. This was where she belonged, surrounded by creatures who needed her, big and small.
