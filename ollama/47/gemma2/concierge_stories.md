The scent of lilies clung to the air in the Grand Regency Hotel, a cloying sweetness that usually brought Eleanor Persephone Hawthorne solace. Tonight, however, it only served as a reminder of the floral arrangement she’d meticulously placed on Mr. Beaumont's desk earlier – a gesture meant to appease his delicate sensibilities after yesterday’s unfortunate incident involving a misplaced monocle and an overly enthusiastic cleaning lady.

Eleanor adjusted her crisp white gloves, smoothing the wrinkles in her black dress as she surveyed the opulent lobby. The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the Persian rugs, highlighting the polished brass of the grand staircase that spiraled upwards into darkness.  The usual hushed murmur of conversation was absent tonight; an unsettling silence hung heavy in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of the grandfather clock in the corner.

A sudden thud from above shattered the stillness. Eleanor's heart leaped into her throat. This wasn't a normal sound. She knew every creak and groan of this ancient building like the back of her hand – this was different. A shiver ran down her spine as she straightened, her gaze fixed on the shadowy upper floors. Something was amiss.
