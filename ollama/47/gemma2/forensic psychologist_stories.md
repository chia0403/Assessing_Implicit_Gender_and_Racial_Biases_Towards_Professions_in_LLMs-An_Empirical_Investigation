The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Evelyn Albright's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the sterile white walls of the interrogation room. She tapped her pen against a worn notepad, her gaze fixed on the man across from her – a hulking figure hunched in his chair, his face obscured by a tangle of dark hair and shadows. His name was Thomas Blackwood, and he was their prime suspect in a string of brutal murders that had gripped the city of Havenwood in terror.

The air hung heavy with tension, thick enough to choke on. Dr. Albright's years as a forensic psychologist for the Havenwood Police Department had hardened her against the raw brutality of human nature, but something about Blackwood’s silence unnerved her.  It wasn't just his sullen demeanor or the way his eyes darted around the room, avoiding hers. It was an emptiness she sensed beneath it all, a chilling lack of remorse that made her skin crawl. 

She knew Blackwood needed to be coaxed out of his shell, gently guided through a labyrinth of psychological questions until he revealed the truth lurking within his dark soul.  This wasn't just about finding a killer; it was about understanding the twisted mind behind the massacre, about peeling back the layers of deception and reaching the core of what made Blackwood tick. 


The clock ticked relentlessly on the wall, each second another piece added to the puzzle that she desperately needed to solve.
