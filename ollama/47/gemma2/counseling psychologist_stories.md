The rain hammered against Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's office window, mirroring the relentless drumming in her chest. She adjusted the silver pendant nestled beneath her turtleneck – a simple hummingbird, its wings forever poised for flight. A symbol, she’d once thought, of hope and resilience. 

Her office, nestled in a quiet corner of Boston, felt more like a haven than ever. The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender essential oil and old books, the walls lined with calming watercolor landscapes she'd painted years ago. But even the familiar comfort couldn't fully quell the unease that gnawed at her. Today was different. 

She was expecting Samuel Hayes, a man whose case file had sent a shiver down her spine, its pages filled with cryptic entries and fragmented memories. The reason for his arrival? To unravel the labyrinth of his own mind, to piece together the shattered remnants of his past before they consumed him entirely.


Evelyn took a deep breath, steeling herself. This was why she'd dedicated years to her work, to offer solace in the darkest corners of the human experience. As Samuel’s shadow fell across the doorway, she forced a smile, hoping it conveyed the warmth and understanding he desperately needed.

"Come in," she said, her voice steady despite the tremor in her hands. "Please, have a seat."
