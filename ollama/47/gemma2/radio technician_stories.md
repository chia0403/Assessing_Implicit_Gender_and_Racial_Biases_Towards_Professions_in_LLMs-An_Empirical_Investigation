The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and burnt solder as Elias Thorne tightened the last screw on the salvaged receiver.  His workshop, a cramped basement burrowed beneath his Aunt Millie's rambling Victorian house in Salem, Massachusetts, was lit by a single bare bulb hanging precariously from a frayed wire.  Dust motes danced in the warm glow, swirling around tools laid out on a workbench scarred with years of tinkering: soldering irons, multimeters, coils of copper wire, and a jumble of disassembled radios of all shapes and sizes. Elias ran a calloused hand over the receiver he'd just finished restoring – a sleek Art Deco beauty from the 1930s, its polished mahogany case gleaming despite the grime clinging to it.  He flipped the switch, and static crackled through the speaker before settling into a muffled murmur.

Elias leaned closer, his brow furrowed in concentration as he tuned the dial. A faint melody drifted through the airwaves, a haunting tune played on a lonely saxophone.  It wasn't a local station; this was something else entirely, something… out there. He knew it wouldn't be long before Salem's superstitious residents whispered about his "radio witchery" again. But Elias didn't care.  He had a feeling this signal held secrets, whispers from beyond the veil of reality, and he was determined to unravel them.
