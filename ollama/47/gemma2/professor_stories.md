The flickering gaslights cast long shadows across Professor Amelia Hawthorne's cluttered desk, illuminating piles of parchment, half-empty inkwells, and an anatomical model with eerily vacant eyes. Outside her window, a biting December wind howled through the cobblestone streets of Edinburgh, rattling the panes and sending shivers down her spine despite the crackling fire in the hearth.  Amelia sighed, pushing aside a tangle of auburn hair that had escaped her tight bun. Her latest research on the folklore surrounding selkies - shapeshifting creatures who could shed their sealskin to become human - had hit a wall. Days bled into weeks, and the whispers of ancient tales offered no concrete answers. Frustrated, Amelia leaned back in her chair, her gaze lingering on a dusty tome bound in aged leather. It was titled "The Sea Witch's Grimoire," a collection of forbidden lore passed down through generations of her family. 

Despite its reputation for containing dangerous knowledge, Amelia couldn't help but feel drawn to its cryptic pages. A flicker of hope sparked within her - perhaps the answers she sought lay hidden within its shadowy verses.  Just as she reached for the grimoire, a sharp rapping on the door sent a jolt through her.
