The neon sign above "The Rusty Mug" buzzed with a tired, intermittent hum, casting an anemic glow on the rain-slicked street below. Inside, the familiar scent of stale beer and regret hung heavy in the air.  A lone figure stood behind the bar, polishing a glass with a practiced hand. This was Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Finch, queen of the corner tavern, reigning over her domain with a wry smile and a bottomless well of patience. 

The rain hammered against the windowpanes, mirroring the rhythm of Amy's weary heart. It had been another slow night at The Rusty Mug, the kind where the only company was the clinking of ice cubes and the ghosts of forgotten laughter echoing in the dim corners.  Amy sighed, wiping her hands on her worn apron and glancing towards the empty stools. Maybe tonight would be the night for an impromptu karaoke session with herself, she thought, a small smile playing at the corner of her lips.
