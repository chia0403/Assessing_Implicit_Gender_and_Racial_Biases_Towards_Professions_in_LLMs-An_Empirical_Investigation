The aroma of burnt toast and old textbooks hung heavy in the air of Mrs. Evelyn Amelia Hawthorne's office.  Sunlight, filtered through the dusty blinds, cast stripes across her worn-out carpet. Papers overflowed from overflowing trays on her desk, each one representing another student grappling with a tangle of anxieties: college applications, first loves, family crises, and the ever-present dread of the future. It was Tuesday afternoon, which meant Mrs. Hawthorneâ€™s usual quiet respite before the evening deluge of tearful confessions and desperate pleas for advice. Today, however, felt different. A tremor of unease pulsed beneath the surface of her routine, as if the air itself was holding its breath. Then the phone rang, shattering the stillness. It wasn't a student calling this time, but someone with a voice thick with urgency. 


"Mrs. Hawthorne?"  the caller whispered. "There's been an accident."   


Evelyn felt her heart lurch.  An accident? Who could it be? The question hung in the air, heavy and unanswered, as she braced herself for whatever news was coming next. Her office, usually a sanctuary of calm amidst the chaos of adolescence, suddenly felt like a pressure cooker about to explode.
