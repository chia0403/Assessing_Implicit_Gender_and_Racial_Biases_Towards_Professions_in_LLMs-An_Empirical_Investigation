The lavender oil hung thick in the air, a hazy curtain between Amelia Rose Hawthorne and the outside world.  Rain lashed against the windows of her studio, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the frosted glass. Outside, the city simmered in the perpetual twilight of an impending storm. Inside, the only sound besides the steady rhythm of rain was the soft clinking of bones as Amelia worked on Mr. Henderson's perpetually knotted shoulders. 

Amelia loved the sanctuary her small studio offered. It was tucked away on a quiet side street, far from the frenetic pulse of the city center. Here, amidst the warm glow of candlelight and the soothing aroma of essential oils, she could melt away the stress and anxieties that clung to people like second skin. 


Mr. Henderson sighed, his face softening under her deft touch. "You have a gift, Amelia," he murmured.  "A real gift."

Amelia smiled faintly, focusing on the tension in his tight muscles. She appreciated his words, but knew they were often just polite platitudes. Most clients came seeking relief, not profound spiritual connection. Still, there was something about this rain-soaked evening, the way the city seemed to be holding its breath outside, that made her feel a strange sense of possibility.  Perhaps, she thought, tonight would be different.
