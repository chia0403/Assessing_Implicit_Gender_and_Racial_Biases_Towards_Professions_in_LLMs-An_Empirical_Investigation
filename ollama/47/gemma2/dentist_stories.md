The midday sun slanted through the stained-glass windows of Dr. Amelia Beaumont’s practice, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the plush burgundy carpet. The air was thick with the sterile scent of disinfectant and faintly metallic tang of…well, let’s just say it wasn't lavender. Amelia, her blonde hair pulled back in a tight bun that threatened to loosen with each patient interaction, leaned against the gleaming countertop of the reception desk, idly flipping through a dental journal.

She was bored, not for lack of patients – Beaumont Dental was thriving in its charming corner of suburban Ohio – but because this Tuesday afternoon felt as predictable as her morning coffee: two anxious children needing fillings, a middle-aged woman complaining about gum sensitivity, and a grumpy retiree who refused to acknowledge the benefits of fluoride. 

Amelia sighed, wishing for something, anything, to disrupt the monotonous rhythm of her day.  Then, the door chimed, announcing a new arrival. A man, tall and imposing with unruly dark hair and eyes that seemed to hold both curiosity and apprehension, stepped into the waiting room. Amelia's pulse quickened. He wasn't like any patient she'd seen before. There was something about him...different.
