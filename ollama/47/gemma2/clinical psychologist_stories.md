The rain hammered against Dr. Eleanor Vance's office window, mimicking the frantic rhythm of her heartbeat. Her gaze flitted between the overflowing in-tray on her desk and the closed door leading to her waiting room. 

Eleanorâ€™s small practice, nestled in a quiet corner of Boston, was usually a sanctuary of calm.  But today, an unsettling tension crackled in the air, a static charge she couldn't shake off. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within the walls, a storm about to break with the arrival of her next patient - a man named Gabriel Thorne, infamous for his chillingly accurate crime predictions and rumoured connection to a string of unsolved murders.  His appointment had arrived as a thunderclap, sending shivers down Eleanor's spine despite years of dealing with patients wrestling with their darkest demons. 


Eleanor took a deep breath, trying to quell the tide of apprehension rising within her. She adjusted the weight of her jade bracelet, a talisman against anxiety passed down from her grandmother, and steeled herself for the storm about to break.
