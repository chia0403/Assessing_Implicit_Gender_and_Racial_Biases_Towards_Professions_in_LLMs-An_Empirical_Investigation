The sun beat down on Silas "Sully" McArthur's neck like an angry blacksmith's hammer.  Sweat stung his eyes as he perched precariously on the peak of Mrs. Peterson's Victorian home, hammering another shingle into place. The air buzzed with the frantic chirps of sparrows and the distant rumble of a truck barreling down Maple Street. Below him, the quaint town of Oakhaven sprawled out like a patchwork quilt, houses nestled between swaying elm trees and tidy flower beds.  

Sully wiped his brow with the back of his calloused hand, squinting at the shimmering heat rising from the asphalt streets.  It was going to be another scorcher, the kind that made even the most seasoned roofer long for a cold beer and a hammock. He sighed, wishing he could take a break, but Mrs. Peterson's leaky roof wasn't going to fix itself. Besides, Sully had promised her it would be done by nightfall. A promise was a promise, no matter how hot the day got.
