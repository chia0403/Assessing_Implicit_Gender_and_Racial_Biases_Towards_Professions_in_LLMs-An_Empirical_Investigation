The sun hadn't even thought about rising yet, but Percival Bartholomew Quillington III was already awake, his boots crunching on the frost-covered grass as he pushed his trusty mower down the path. The air smelled of damp earth and pine needles, a familiar comfort in the pre-dawn stillness of Whispering Pines Cemetery.  

Percival, or "Percy" as everyone called him, had been tending to this sprawling haven for the departed for over twenty years. He knew every grave by heart, every twist and turn of the winding paths, every rustle of leaves that might signal a curious squirrel or an overly enthusiastic crow.  The cemetery wasn't just his job; it was his sanctuary, a place where the living and the dead coexisted in quiet harmony. 

Today, however, the usual peace felt fragile. A thick mist clung to the ground like a shroud, muting the familiar sounds of birdsong. Percy shivered, not from the chill but from an unsettling feeling that something was different, something... off. He brushed it aside as nerves, perhaps fueled by the strange dream he'd had the night before â€“ a dream filled with whispering voices and an eerie green glow emanating from beneath a specific tombstone. 


He stopped to adjust his glasses, squinting into the swirling mist as he approached the designated area for the day's work. And that's when he saw it: a single red rose, freshly plucked and lying on top of the gravestone in his dream. A chill ran down his spine, making him question if the whispers from his slumber were truly just dreams.
