The smell of sawdust and varnish hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elias Blackwood's worn denim overalls like a second skin. His workshop, nestled deep within the emerald folds of the Appalachian Mountains, was a sanctuary of wood and light. Sunbeams pierced through gaps in the corrugated metal roof, illuminating motes dancing in the dusty air. Outside, the wind whispered through towering pines, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and fallen leaves. Elias, his weathered hands calloused from years of shaping timber, ran a thumb over the smooth surface of a half-finished rocking chair. He could almost hear the rhythmic creak of its seat, felt the gentle sway as someone settled into it, lost in contemplation.  

But today, the familiar comfort of his workshop couldn't fully drown out the gnawing worry twisting in Elias's gut. A letter had arrived that morning, bearing news that sent a chill through his bones. His niece, Lily, was coming to live with him.
