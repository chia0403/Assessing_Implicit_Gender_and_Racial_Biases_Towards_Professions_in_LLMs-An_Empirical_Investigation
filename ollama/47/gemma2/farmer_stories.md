The rooster’s crow was a shrill alarm clock in the pre-dawn darkness, jolting Elias Blackwood from his uneasy sleep. He sat up on the edge of his straw mattress, listening to the familiar sounds of his farm waking: the sleepy clucking of hens, the distant snort of Bessie the cow, and the creaking of the old windmill struggling against the morning breeze.  

Elias ran a calloused hand over his stubbled jaw, squinting through the dusty windowpane at the pale sliver of sun just beginning to peek over the rolling hills. The air was thick with the scent of damp earth and hay, a smell that usually brought him comfort. Today, though, it felt heavy with a sense of foreboding.  

His farm, Blackwood Acres, nestled in the heart of the Shenandoah Valley, had always been his haven. Generations of Blackwoods had tilled these lands, their lives intertwined with the rhythm of the seasons. But lately, that rhythm had faltered. The rains were erratic, crops wilted under a relentless sun, and the whispers about drought and hardship drifted into Elias’s quiet world like unwelcome guests. 


This morning, however, the worry wasn't just about the weather. A letter arrived with the mailman yesterday - a summons from the County Council regarding the encroaching development on their land.  The council was considering allowing construction of a new highway that would slice through Blackwood Acres, tearing apart the tapestry Elias had known his entire life.
