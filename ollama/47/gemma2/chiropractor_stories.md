The rhythmic click-clack of Dr. Amelia Celeste’s adjustments echoed through her small practice, a symphony of bone popping and muscle sighs. Sunlight streamed through the windows, painting dust motes dancing in the air and warming the worn wood floor. Outside, the bustling city hummed, but within these walls, time seemed to stretch and bend, focused on the individual aches and pains brought to Amelia’s gentle care. 

Her office, tucked away on a quiet side street in Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood, was more like an oasis than a medical practice. The air smelled faintly of lavender essential oil, calming anxiety as patients settled onto plush cushions draped over antique rocking chairs.  Amelia herself exuded a serene energy, her dark eyes crinkling at the corners when she smiled, and her hands moving with a practiced grace that spoke of years spent listening to the whispers of the body. 

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Amelia's spine as she prepared for her next patient. It wasn’t the usual pre-appointment jitters – this was a deeper sense, a feeling that something out of place was about to disrupt the familiar rhythm of her day. 


The bell above the door tinkled, announcing the arrival of a man who seemed to carry the weight of the world on his shoulders. He wore a trench coat despite the warm spring air and cast a shadow over the doorway, obscuring his features from view. Amelia felt that unsettling prickle intensify as she watched him step into her sanctuary, bringing with him an unwelcome sense of foreboding.
