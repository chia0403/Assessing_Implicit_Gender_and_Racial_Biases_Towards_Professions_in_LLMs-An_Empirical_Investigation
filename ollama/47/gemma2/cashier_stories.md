The fluorescent hum of the grocery store ceiling lights buzzed in Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's ears like a persistent fly. She tapped her acrylic nails against the chipped countertop, the rhythm mimicking the monotonous beep of the scanner as she scanned Mrs. Hendersonâ€™s weekly haul of canned peaches and discount ramen. The air hung thick with the scent of overripe bananas and stale french fries. 

Amelia lived for Friday nights. Not for the movies or parties like her friends, but for the quiet lull after the dinner rush when the aisles emptied and the chatter faded to a low hum. Tonight, though, even that solace was proving elusive. A line snaked through the store, fueled by families desperate for last-minute barbecue supplies and bargain hunters seeking discounted ice cream. Amelia sighed, adjusting her nametag with a weary smile. Just another Friday night at Hawthorne's Groceries, where dreams went to die and peaches were king.
