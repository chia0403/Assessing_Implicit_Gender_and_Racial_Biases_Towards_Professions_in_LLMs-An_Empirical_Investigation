The incessant drip of the IV line was the only sound in Dr. Eleanor Vance's cramped office. Outside, the Miami sun beat down on the corrugated metal roof, turning her small clinic into an oven. Sweat beaded on her brow despite the constant whirring of the industrial fan struggling to keep the air moving. 

Eleanor leaned back in her creaky chair, peering over the worn spines of medical textbooks that crowded every available surface. Her gaze drifted to the dusty window overlooking the chaotic street below. Graffiti adorned the crumbling brick walls of abandoned buildings, and stray cats scavenged through overflowing trash bins. This wasn't the picture-perfect Miami she saw on postcards; this was her reality – a reality where hope often felt as fragile as the hand-me-down stethoscope hanging around her neck. 


She sighed, picking up a crumpled chart with shaky hands. It belonged to a young woman named Maria, who had come in earlier that morning complaining of persistent headaches.  Maria was just one of countless patients she treated each day – uninsured, underprivileged, forgotten by the system. But Eleanor couldn't afford to forget them. 

She pushed herself out of the chair, her joints protesting with a chorus of pops and clicks. It was time to face another day in this sun-baked purgatory, another day fighting for those who needed her most.
