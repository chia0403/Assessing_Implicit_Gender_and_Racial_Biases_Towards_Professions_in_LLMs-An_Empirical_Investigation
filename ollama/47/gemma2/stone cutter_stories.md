The sun beat down on Cormac Liam O'Connell's neck as he surveyed his work. Sweat beaded on his brow, stinging his eyes, but he didn't dare wipe it away. A single flick of his hand could send a tremor through the delicate veins of granite running before him, disrupting months of painstaking effort. This wasn't just any piece; this was the centerpiece for Lord Harrington's new manor, a massive, sculpted eagle intended to be the envy of every noble in the county.

Cormac lived and breathed stone. His small workshop nestled on the outskirts of Dunhaven, perched precariously atop a cliff overlooking the churning Atlantic, was more home than business. The air was always thick with the scent of grit and seawater, a constant reminder of his connection to both earth and sea. He’d learned the trade from his father, a man who had carved stories into stone before Cormac could even walk. Now, at thirty-five years old, he stood as the most skilled craftsman in Dunhaven, a title earned not through arrogance, but through quiet dedication and an almost supernatural understanding of the secrets hidden within each block. 


The eagle’s wings were almost complete, reaching out towards the sky like a promise of flight. But Cormac knew there was still work to be done - the eyes needed to be just right, capturing both power and wisdom. It was here, in the meticulous detail, that he truly found himself, lost in the rhythmic rasp of his tools against the stone, his mind a calm sea amidst the storm of creation.
