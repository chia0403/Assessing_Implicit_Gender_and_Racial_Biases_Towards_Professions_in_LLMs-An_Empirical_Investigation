Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek Elementary, mimicking the torrent swirling in Dr. Amelia Rose Thorne's mind.  The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the cramped office that served as her sanctuary. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the branches of the ancient oak that stood sentinel by the playground. 

Amelia stared at the file in front of her: "Ethan Carter, suspected behavioral issues." She knew Ethan's case was more complicated than the label suggested. He was withdrawn, often lost in a world unseen by others, his silence punctuated only by bursts of unsettling anger. Amelia craved answers, yearned to reach through the wall of fear and isolation that seemed to encase him, but she felt utterly lost.  This storm, both literal and metaphorical, mirrored the turmoil within her own heart - a struggle between her desire to help Ethan and the gnawing uncertainty of whether she could ever truly understand him. 


**Setting:** A small town elementary school nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. The weather is perpetually gloomy, reflecting the melancholic atmosphere that hangs heavy over the town.
