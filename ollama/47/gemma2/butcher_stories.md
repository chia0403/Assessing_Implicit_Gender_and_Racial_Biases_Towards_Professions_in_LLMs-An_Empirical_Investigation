The air in Arthur Thaddeus Blackwood's butcher shop hung thick with the scent of iron and rosemary. A symphony of clanging cleavers, the rhythmic thump of sausages being stuffed, and the low murmur of Mrs. Henderson haggling for a better price on her ground beef created a familiar soundtrack to Arthur's day. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating the rows of gleaming meat hooks, each laden with prime cuts waiting their turn to become someone's dinner. The shop itself was nestled on Maple Street, a quiet thoroughfare in the heart of Willow Creek, a town where secrets were whispered like sausage recipes and gossip spread faster than a butcher knife through a tenderloin. 


Arthur, his apron splattered with what could only be assumed as both blood and ketchup (he hadn't had time to wash it yet), wiped his brow with a hand that smelled faintly of lamb fat and sawdust. He surveyed the scene, a familiar sense of comfort settling over him. This was his world - a world of primal instincts and honest labor, where the rhythm of life pulsed in the beating heart of every animal he served.  


But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation danced along Arthur's skin, a whisper that warned him the familiar peace of his butcher shop might be about to shatter.
