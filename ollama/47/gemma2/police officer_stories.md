The rain hammered on Sergeant Amelia "Amy" Davies' patrol car, blurring the neon glow of the diner sign across the street.  A sickly yellow light spilled onto the slick asphalt, illuminating puddles that reflected the grimy windows and shattered dreams of this forgotten corner of Brighton. It was 3:17 AM â€“ prime time for a city drowning in its own self-destruction, and Amy felt the familiar ache of responsibility settling deep in her bones. This town didn't sleep, it just shifted through different shades of misery, and she was the one tasked with navigating the darkness.  


The radio crackled to life, pulling her from her thoughts. "Davies, we have a possible B&E at 14 Elm Street. Repeat, B&E at 14 Elm Street."  Amy sighed, gripped the steering wheel tighter, and slammed her foot on the gas pedal. Elm Street. Another night, another broken window. At least tonight it wasn't a screaming woman or a shattered life. But in Brighton, even a burglary held the potential to unravel into something much worse.
