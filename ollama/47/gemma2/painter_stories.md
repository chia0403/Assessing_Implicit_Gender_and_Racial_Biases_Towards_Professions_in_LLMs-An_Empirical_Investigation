The scent of linseed oil hung heavy in the air, mingling with the dust motes dancing in the slanting rays of the late afternoon sun that streamed through Amelia Beatrice Finch's studio window. Outside, the bustling city of Seville simmered below, its vibrant energy a world away from the quiet solitude she found within these four walls. 

Amelia leaned back, her brush poised mid-stroke on the canvas before her. A half-finished flamenco dancer pirouetted in oils and watercolors, her crimson dress a blur of motion against the stark white background. Amelia, usually so focused, felt a knot of anxiety tightening in her chest. This commission, for a prestigious gallery opening next month, was everything. It could be her ticket to recognition, a chance to finally break free from the shadow of her late father's renowned name. But lately, every brushstroke felt clumsy, every color muted. 


**Setting:**  Amelia Beatrice Finchâ€™s art studio, located in a converted loft apartment overlooking the bustling city of Seville, Spain. The year is 1928.
