The air hung heavy with the scent of hay and manure, a familiar perfume to Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne, better known as Amy to everyone at the Sanctuary. Sunlight slanted through the dusty barn windows, illuminating motes dancing in the still morning air. A rooster crowed somewhere in the distance, a sound that usually roused Amy from sleep, but today she’d been up for hours, her mind churning with worry.  

The Sanctuary was usually a haven of peace and contentment. Its inhabitants, rescued creatures great and small – from the majestic greyhound with a limp to the mischievous guinea pig who loved hiding in Amy's boot – thrived under her watchful care. But today, an unsettling silence had settled over the farm. The usual chorus of clucking chickens, barking dogs, and bleating sheep was absent, replaced by an eerie quiet that gnawed at Amy’s heart. 


Something was wrong. Very wrong.
