Rain lashed against the grimy window of Amelia Blackwood’s apartment, mimicking the drumming in her chest.  The scent of stale coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the damp chill that seeped through the crumbling walls. A lone bare bulb cast harsh shadows on the cluttered desk where a half-written article about the city's escalating homelessness crisis lay abandoned. Amelia rubbed her tired eyes, willing herself to focus. The deadline loomed, but the words refused to come. 

Amelia Blackwood wasn’t your typical investigative journalist. She didn’t chase glamorous scoops or rub elbows with power players. Her beat was the underbelly of Newhaven, a sprawling metropolis choked by inequality and riddled with secrets that whispered in the shadows.  She was drawn to the forgotten, the voiceless, the stories that mainstream media overlooked. But tonight, even her unwavering purpose felt lost beneath the weight of frustration and exhaustion. The city's incessant rain seemed to mirror her own inner turmoil, a constant, relentless pressure threatening to drown her.


The phone on her desk rang, jarring her from her thoughts. A familiar, gruff voice crackled through the receiver. "Blackwood, you got somethin' for me? My source says somethin’ big is about to break." 

Amelia straightened, a spark of renewed purpose igniting within her. This could be it. The story that would make a difference, even in this city perpetually shrouded in darkness.
