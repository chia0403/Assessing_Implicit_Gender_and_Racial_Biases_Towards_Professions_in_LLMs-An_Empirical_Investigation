The incessant drip-drip-drip echoed through the cramped bathroom like a metronome marking time’s relentless march. Amelia Rosewater tightened her wrench, cursing under her breath as she tried to coax the stubborn valve into submission. Steam swirled around her head, blurring the lines between the grime of rusted pipes and the rising panic in her chest. This wasn't just another leaky faucet; it was a symphony of disaster, threatening to overflow into Mrs. Henderson’s antique rug – a relic worth more than Amelia’s entire toolkit.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered workbench in Mrs. Henderson's spare room, turning the assortment of wrenches, pliers, and pipes into menacing silhouettes. The air was thick with the scent of old wood polish and desperation. Outside, the bustling city of New Haven hummed with life, oblivious to Amelia’s battle against a dripping faucet and her own mounting anxieties.
