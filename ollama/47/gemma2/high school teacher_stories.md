The bell shrieked its final note, sending a wave of relieved groans through Ms. Eleanor Amelia Cartwright's Advanced Placement Literature class.  They scrambled for their bags, eager to escape the stuffy confines of Room 214 at Northwood High School. Eleanor sighed, watching them go, a familiar ache settling in her chest. She loved teaching, truly she did, but sometimes the endless cycle of lessons, grading, and parent-teacher conferences felt more like a treadmill than a journey.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor as Eleanor turned to face the chalkboard, its surface a battlefield of equations and Shakespearean quotes. Outside, the summer air hummed with cicadas, a soundtrack to the quiet fading of another school year. But inside Room 214, an invisible tension lingered, like dust motes dancing in a sunbeam.  It was a feeling Eleanor couldn't shake, a premonition that this last day of term would be anything but ordinary.


Eleanor rubbed her temples, wondering if it was simply the exhaustion talking. Perhaps she needed a longer vacation than usual. Or maybe, just maybe, something bigger was brewing beneath the surface of Northwood High School.
