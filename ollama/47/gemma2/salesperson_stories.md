The air in the showroom hung thick with the scent of new leather and desperation.  Sunlight slanted through the massive plate glass windows, illuminating dust motes dancing above rows upon rows of gleaming automobiles, each one a silent plea for attention. It was this desperate silence that Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Thorne, head salesperson at Prestige Motors, desperately sought to break. 


Her day had started like any other: a symphony of ringing phones, insistent emails, and the echoing emptiness left by customers who couldn't stomach another hard sell. Amy longed for the days when cars were coveted objects, not burdens weighed down by financial anxieties and shrinking budgets.  

Today was different though. Today was her chance. A wealthy investor, rumored to be in town scouting for a new acquisition, had his eyes set on a particularly rare vintage sports car tucked away in the back corner of the showroom. It was Amy's ace in the hole, a gleaming beacon of possibility in this sea of fading chrome and lowered expectations. If she could close this deal, maybe, just maybe, she could breathe life back into Prestige Motors, and herself, before it was too late. 


The clock ticked past noon, each second a hammer blow against her dwindling hope. Then, the double doors swung open, revealing a tall figure cloaked in an air of quiet confidence.  Amy straightened her collar, took a deep breath, and launched into her practiced spiel. It was time to sell.
