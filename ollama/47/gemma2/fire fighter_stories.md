The siren screamed, a mournful wail that sliced through the pre-dawn quiet of Seattle. Elias "Eli" Thorne gripped the steering wheel tighter, his knuckles white against the worn leather. The familiar adrenaline surge pulsed through him, a mix of fear and excitement that always accompanied the call to duty. Rain lashed against the windshield, blurring the city lights into streaks of color. Eli knew this storm would make things difficult, but he wouldn't let it deter him. He was Station 19's most experienced firefighter, a veteran who had seen his fair share of hellfires and harrowing rescues. This one, though, felt different. A prickling unease settled in his gut, a feeling that gnawed at the edges of his confidence.

They skidded to a halt in front of a towering apartment building on the edge of downtown, its glass facade shimmering ominously in the flashes of lightning. Smoke billowed from a window several stories up, an angry orange tongue licking against the dark sky. The weight of responsibility settled on Eli's shoulders. Lives hung in the balance, and he was their only hope. He barked out orders to his crew, his voice sharp and clear over the howling wind and roaring flames.  Tonight, Station 19 would face a battle unlike any they had seen before.
