The scent of lemon polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea wafting from the drawing-room. Elara Thistlewood, her hands stained a pale yellow from cleaning the antique silver, peered out the window of the sprawling manor house. A grey drizzle was just beginning to fall, blanketing the manicured lawns and ancient oak trees in a veil of mist. The familiar scene always filled her with a quiet melancholy; she felt like an extra character in a story, watching life unfold around her but never truly participating. 

The grand house, known as Blackwood Manor, had been home to Elara since she was a child. Her parents had worked here for generations before her, tending to the needs of its wealthy inhabitants â€“ first Lord and Lady Ashton, then their son, Alistair, who had inherited the sprawling estate upon his father's death. Now, Alistair was gone too, vanished without a trace six months prior, leaving Elara and the other staff in a state of suspended animation.
