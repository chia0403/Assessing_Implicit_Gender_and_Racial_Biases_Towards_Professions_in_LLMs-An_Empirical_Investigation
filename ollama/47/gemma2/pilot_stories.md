The relentless Martian wind screamed through Amelia "Ace" Thorne's headset, whipping sand against the viewport of her rickety spacecraft, the 'Rusty Comet'. A crimson sun bled across the horizon, casting long shadows over the ochre dunes that stretched endlessly before her.  Dust devils danced in the distance, their swirling forms like miniature whirlwinds on an alien canvas. Ace gripped the control yoke tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. This landing was proving to be far rougher than she'd anticipated. 

The Rusty Comet lurched violently, bucking like a bronco as it struggled to descend through the thinning Martian atmosphere. The warning lights blinked frantically on the instrument panel, casting an eerie red glow across Ace's face. Sweat prickled under her helmet, but she kept her focus unwavering. A successful landing here was crucial â€“ her next shipment of bioluminescent algae for the hydroponics lab depended on it. 

Ace swallowed hard, her throat dry as the Martian air. She was pushing the Rusty Comet to its limits, and every bone in her body screamed at her to abort. But she couldn't. Not with those precious cargo containers strapped beneath her craft, containing the lifeblood of their colony.  


The ground rushed up to meet them, a blur of red sand and jagged rock. Ace braced herself for impact.
