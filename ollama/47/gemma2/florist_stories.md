The scent of lilies hung heavy in the air, mingling with the crisp autumn breeze that snaked through the open doorway of "Petals & Prose."  Inside, Amelia Rose Hawthorne surveyed her domain: a kaleidoscope of color bursting from every corner. Crimson dahlias jostled for space with blushing peonies, and vibrant sunflowers stretched towards the skylights like golden arms. Sunlight filtered through stained-glass windows, casting rainbows across the worn wooden floorboards. 

Amelia ran a gloved hand over a velvety rosebud, its crimson deepening against her ivory skin. It was a Friday morning in October, the air buzzing with the last embers of summer and the anticipation of Halloween.  As usual, Amelia found herself lost in the symphony of scents and textures, feeling a sense of calm wash over her that only surrounded by blooms could bring. 


This was her sanctuary, her haven, "Petals & Prose." And though business had been slow lately, Amelia wouldn't trade it for anything in the world.
