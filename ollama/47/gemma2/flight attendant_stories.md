The stale scent of airplane peanuts clung to Elara Amelia Vance like a second skin. She tugged at the collar of her crisp blue uniform, willing the knot in her stomach to loosen. Flight 372 from Seattle to London was already boarding, and with it came the usual pre-flight jitters. It wasn't the passengers she worried about; they were predictable, a tapestry of tired businesspeople, eager families, and solo travellers nursing dreams in cramped economy seats. No, Elara's unease stemmed from something deeper, something that whispered in the shadows of her mind every time she touched down on foreign soil.  

She smoothed out the wrinkles on her name tag - "Elara Vance" stared back at her - a constant reminder of her chosen anonymity. The world outside the cabin was a whirlwind of languages and customs, each one a potential risk to the carefully constructed life she had built. Here, amongst the recycled air and plastic trays, Elara felt safe, invisible. Yet, the whispers persisted, gnawing at the edges of her composure. They spoke of a past she desperately tried to forget, a past that threatened to catch up with her every time she took to the skies.  

The familiar hum of the engines vibrated through her body as the plane taxied down the runway. Elara took a deep breath, bracing herself for the journey ahead. Little did she know, this flight would be anything but ordinary.
