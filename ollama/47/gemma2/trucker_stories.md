The sun bled across the vast Nevada desert, casting long, skeletal shadows from Joshua trees that clung precariously to the parched earth. The air hung thick with dust and the distant hum of cicadas. 

Darrell "Red" McAlister pulled his Peterbilt, a behemoth of chrome and steel affectionately nicknamed “The Red Devil,” off the highway onto the dusty shoulder. He squinted through the windshield, wiping a smear of diesel grease from his brow. The thermometer on his dashboard glared back at him: 112 degrees Fahrenheit.  

Red stretched his aching muscles, feeling the familiar pull in his lower back from years spent hunched over the wheel. A plume of dust rose behind him as he climbed out of the cab, his boots crunching on the gravel. The silence, broken only by the distant whine of an approaching truck, pressed against him like a physical weight. 


He was two days into a haul from Los Angeles to Chicago, carrying a load of auto parts destined for a factory in Ohio. This stretch through Nevada always felt the most desolate – a tapestry woven with loneliness and endless sky.
