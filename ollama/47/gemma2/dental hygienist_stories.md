The air hung thick with the scent of antiseptic and peppermint as Emilia Blackwood carefully maneuvered her ultrasonic scaler around Mr. Henderson's molar. He was a regular, a retired history professor with a perpetual furrow in his brow that deepened whenever he mentioned his bridge club losses.  

Emilia worked at "Smiles by Sunnyside," a modest dental practice nestled on the corner of Elm and Oak Street in sleepy Willow Creek, Ohio. A charming town where the biggest news involved Mrs. Peterson's prize-winning zucchini and the monthly bake sale at the community center. It was the kind of place where everyone knew your name, your childhood dog's name, and the embarrassing dental procedure you underwent in high school.  

Emilia wasn't always so content with Willow Creek's quiet predictability. She dreamt of bigger cities, bustling hospitals, maybe even specializing in cosmetic dentistry. But life had a way of gently nudging you back to where you belonged, sometimes with the gentle persuasion of a familiar scent or a comforting routine like scraping away plaque. 


The chime above the door jangled, interrupting Emilia's thoughts. A new patient walked in, a tall woman with piercing blue eyes and a whirlwind of auburn hair that seemed to defy gravity.  Emilia couldn't help but feel a flicker of curiosity. Something about this woman, shrouded in an aura of quiet intensity, felt different from the usual Willow Creek residents.
