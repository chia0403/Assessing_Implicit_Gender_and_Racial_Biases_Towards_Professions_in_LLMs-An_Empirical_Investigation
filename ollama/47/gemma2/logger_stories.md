The dawn crept over the Cascade Mountains like a shy child, hesitant to fully reveal itself behind the towering pines. Dew clung to the thick needles, glistening like scattered diamonds in the pale light filtering through the canopy. The air was crisp and carried the scent of damp earth and pine sap, a fragrance that Elias Blackwood inhaled deeply, grounding him in this familiar world. 

Elias, his calloused hands gripping the worn leather of his gloves, adjusted the strap on his helmet, the sun's warmth just beginning to prick at his exposed skin. He squinted towards the towering Douglas fir he had marked for felling earlier that morning, a behemoth of a tree reaching skyward with ancient majesty. It was his job to bring it down, to transform this silent giant into lumber that would become someone elseâ€™s home, their desk, their firewood. A simple task, yet one that demanded respect and careful consideration. Elias wasn't just a logger; he was a sculptor of the wilderness, a craftsman of nature's raw materials. 


This particular patch of forest, nestled deep within the foothills of Mount Rainier, was his domain. It had been his father's before him, passed down through generations of Blackwoods who understood the rhythms of the forest, the language of the trees, and the delicate balance between taking and giving.  Elias knew every twist and turn of this terrain like the lines on his own weathered palms. He felt a profound connection to these woods, a sense of responsibility to protect them as much as harvest from them.
