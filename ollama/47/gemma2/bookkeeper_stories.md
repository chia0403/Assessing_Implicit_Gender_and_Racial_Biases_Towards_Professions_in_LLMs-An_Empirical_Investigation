The aroma of stale coffee and dust hung thick in the air of Evelyn Beatrice Finch's tiny office. Sunlight, filtering through the grime-streaked windowpanes, cast long shadows across stacks of invoices, receipts, and ledger books that threatened to consume her entire world.  Evelyn, perched precariously on a wobbly stool, squinted at a particularly perplexing set of figures for Mrs. Higgins' bakery. The flour shortage was throwing everything out of whack – profit margins were shrinking faster than the last loaf of sourdough in the display case.

It wasn’t the first time Evelyn had found herself wrestling with the unpredictable whims of small business owners. As the sole bookkeeper for Maple Creek's bustling downtown, she was a seasoned veteran of fluctuating inventory, late payments, and the occasional panicked phone call from someone who simply couldn't reconcile their debit card purchases. 

But today felt different. A knot of unease tightened in Evelyn’s chest as she glanced at the clock – nearly noon, and no word from Mr. Peterson, her most important client. He was a stickler for routine, always dropping off his monthly reports by eleven sharp. His silence felt like an ominous tremor, shaking the foundations of her usually predictable world.
