The flickering neon sign outside "Grimes & Garret" cast an sickly green glow over Amelia Rose Beaumont's face as she hurried across the deserted parking lot. A drizzle had begun to fall, fat raindrops splattering on her borrowed trench coat and turning the asphalt into a slick mirror reflecting the city's weary skyline. The air was thick with the smell of rain and exhaust fumes, a familiar cocktail in this part of Chicago.  

Amelia shivered, not just from the chill but also from the knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach. This was her first solo assignment for Grimes & Garret, a prestigious law firm that had scooped her up fresh out of paralegal school. Her boss, Mr. Garret himself, had entrusted her with the Carter case – a high-profile divorce with enough juicy details to make headlines and potentially ruin several lives. And she was responsible for digging through years of financial records, emails, and scandalous testimonies before the trial even began.

As Amelia pushed open the heavy glass door, the warmth of the office lobby washed over her. She was surrounded by the familiar bustle – lawyers barking into phones, secretaries tapping away at computers, and the faint murmur of hushed legal debates. But tonight, amidst this usual symphony of city life, there was a new sound: the insistent ringing of a phone that seemed to mock Amelia's growing sense of unease.
