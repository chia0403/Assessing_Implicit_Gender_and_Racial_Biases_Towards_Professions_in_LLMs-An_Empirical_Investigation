The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Thorne's head like trapped bees in a cage. Papers piled higher than her ankles on the worn wooden desk, their edges softened from years of use. The smell of stale coffee and desperation hung thick in the air of her cramped office at the downtown law firm.  It was always a Tuesday, Amy thought grimly, because Tuesdays were the day where hope seemed to die, replaced by mountains of legal jargon she had yet to decipher.

Outside, the rain hammered against the windowpanes like a frustrated drummer's erratic rhythm. The city skyline, usually a beacon of shimmering ambition in the evening light, was now shrouded in a dull gray haze, mirroring the bleak feeling that settled over Amy.  The case at hand, a desperate plea from a struggling single parent facing eviction, had her drowning in paperwork and legal jargon, each word like another nail hammered into the coffin of her own dwindling optimism. 

Amy sighed, running a tired hand through her already unkempt hair. This wasn't how she envisioned starting her career, not after years of working diligently to earn her paralegal degree. She wanted more than just endless files and legal jargon; she craved justice, real hope, even if it was just a single life changed for the better.
