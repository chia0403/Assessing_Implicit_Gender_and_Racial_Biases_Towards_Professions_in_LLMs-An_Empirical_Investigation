The flickering neon sign of the "Drain-King Plumbing" shack cast an oily yellow glow on a rain-slicked afternoon in New Orleans' French Quarter.  Sweat stung Adrian "Fingers" Lafontaine's eyes as he wrestled with a stubborn clog in Mrs. Moreauâ€™s antique iron claw bathtub, its worn porcelain surface reflecting the streetlights in warped, ghostly images. The smell of jasmine and damp earth mingled with the stench of old pipes and mildew, a familiar cocktail that was as much a part of New Orleans as the French Quarter architecture itself. 

Fingers, a man built like an oak tree but whose hands moved with surprising dexterity, had seen more plumbing nightmares than he cared to count over his twenty years working the city's hidden network of arteries.  His late father's legacy - a family business that kept New Orleans' water flowing and its citizens content (mostly) - was a thread woven through his very being. 

"Mrs. Moreau, you've got somethin' real special goin' on in here," he grumbled to the elderly woman, whose wrinkled face held an expression as stoic as the stone gargoyles that dotted the neighborhood's rooftops.  She merely smiled, her eyes twinkling like tiny beads of starlight. "Just another day for Drain-King."
