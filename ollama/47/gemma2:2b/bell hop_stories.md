The air in the Grand Astoria hung heavy with expectation and stale perfume. It clung to Edgar's crisp uniform like a second skin, even after he'd donned it just this morning, its fresh-linen scent already beginning to clash with the cloying sweetness of Mrs. Winthrop's lavender cologne wafting from her suite on the fourth floor. Edgar adjusted his fedora, its shadow falling across his face, making him look more like a silent film star than the bustling bellhop he really was. 

He knew every inch of this grand hotel â€“ from the gilded elevator doors that whispered secrets to those who dared press their ears close, to the hushed corners where dust motes danced in the afternoon light filtering through stained-glass windows. Edgar's days were filled with carrying luggage and fetching forgotten dreams; his nights, with keeping his wits about him as he navigated the labyrinthine hallways of wealth and illusion. Tonight, however, was different.  Tonight, a sense of urgency pressed down on Edgar like the weight of an unseen storm brewing overhead, leaving him feeling anything but at home in the opulent symphony of the Grand Astoria.
