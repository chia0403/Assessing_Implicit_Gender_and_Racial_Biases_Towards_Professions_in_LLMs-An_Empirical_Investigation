The fluorescent hum of the clinic's lights buzzed in Amelia's ears as she moved across the waiting room. It was almost always like this â€“ the steady, rhythmic pulse of anxiety beneath the surface of polite smiles and forced small talk. Today was no different. Her gaze lingered on a nervous young man huddled in the corner with his hand hovering precariously over the worn-out magazine. Amelia knew exactly what he was thinking: "What if they find something?" 

Her name, just as she had chosen it, was **Amelia Hawthorne**.  She'd been a phlebotomist for five years and in that time, she'd developed a knack for reading people like a well-worn book. Today, the man in the corner reeked of desperation - his eyes were downcast, fingers twisting nervously at the seams of his worn jeans. He was waiting for his mother to leave her office, where she saw patients with conditions far more serious than Amelia usually treated: cancer and heart disease, the kind that made you feel vulnerable to every breeze. 

Amelia sighed, adjusting the black scrubs beneath the badge that read "Hawthorne Phlebotomy". The fluorescent lights reflected off the polished steel of the nearby equipment - a stark contrast to the warm, earthy scent of her grandmother's herbal remedies she used in her home apothecary back when Amelia was a girl, before the clinic.  She glanced at the clock on the wall, its pale numbers ticking away like the beat of a slow heart, and started prepping for her next patient - the one who would be facing the truth.
