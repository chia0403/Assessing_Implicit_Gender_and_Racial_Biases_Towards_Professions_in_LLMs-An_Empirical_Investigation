Rain lashed against the windows, mirroring the storm brewing inside Miss Evelyn Primrose's heart.  Kindergarten was never meant to be this loud, this chaotic, and this… *heartbreaking*. She stared at her students, faces illuminated by the flickering glow of an overhead projector showing the magnificent Great Migration of Wildebeests across the Serengeti plains. It was a beautiful sight, one that had sparked the children's imagination, but it was also just another reminder of the missing piece in their mosaic lives. The only remaining puzzle piece in their tiny classroom, a void left by Liam's absence since his family moved back to Canada weeks ago. 

Miss Primrose was known for her vibrant, whimsical classroom, filled with hand-painted murals and a jungle gym where the students explored imaginary worlds like fearless explorers on a never-ending adventure.  But today, even Miss Primrose’s usually infectious laughter seemed strained. The usual playful buzz of young minds now felt sluggish, muted by a silence she hadn't anticipated, that seemed to weigh down her own spirit like an invisible blanket. The room felt oddly empty, a stark contrast to the vibrant tapestry of life she nurtured daily. 

**Setting:** A cozy, colorful kindergarten classroom in a quiet neighborhood on a rainy afternoon.  The space is filled with playful decor - bright paint splattered walls, climbing structures adorned with jungle vines, and shelves overflowing with books. 


**Main Character:** Miss Evelyn Primrose, a kind-hearted and spirited kindergarten teacher who finds joy in nurturing young minds and fostering their imaginations.
