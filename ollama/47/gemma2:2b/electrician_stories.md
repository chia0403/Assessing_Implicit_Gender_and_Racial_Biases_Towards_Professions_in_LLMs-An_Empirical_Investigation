The flicker of the fluorescent lights above seemed to mimic the anxiety throbbing in Ethan Thorne's temples. It was 2:03 am. A Tuesday.  His workshop was dark, save for the eerie glow of his voltmeter and the steady hum of the generator powering his tools. Outside, the wind howled like a tormented beast as rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof, each drop shattering into an echoing drumbeat on the metal facade. Ethan had been wrestling with this faulty wiring for hours, the frustration mounting with each passing minute. His usual solace – the comforting hum of his machinery and the quiet rhythm of his work – was being brutally interrupted by the relentless storm and a growing sense of dread.

Ethan Thorne wasn't your average electrician. Not just because he preferred the old-school charm of wire connectors over the latest automated systems, but because his job had become more than simply fixing broken circuits. He worked on the forgotten edges of society: maintaining aging community centers, repairing streetlights in crumbling urban landscapes, and even patching up the failing electrical grids powering remote villages. His work was often whispered about in hushed tones, seen as a vital lifeline for those living in the forgotten corners of the world. Yet, tonight felt different, heavier than usual. It wasn't just the storm; it was something else. Something gnawing at his confidence and driving a wedge between him and the flickering hope of a successful repair.
