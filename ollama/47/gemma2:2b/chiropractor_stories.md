The late afternoon sun dripped through the blinds of Dr. Elara Hawthorne's office, casting warm shadows across the polished hardwood floor. A faint scent of lavender lingered in the air, an incongruous touch in the sterile, modern space that was meant to evoke calm and healing.  Elara straightened her scrubs, adjusting a loose cuff on her white coat as she glanced at the clock: 4:15 pm. Just a few more patients and she'd be free for a much-needed walk through the nearby park. It was one of Elaraâ€™s favorite routines - her therapy sessions were always followed by an hour in nature, the crisp air and dappled sunlight on the grass allowing her mind to unwind from the day's pressures.

But today, she felt a knot of dread tighten in her chest.  It wasn't just the usual aches and pains that filled her mornings with patient interaction - it was something deeper, an unease that had lingered for days. Elara had never truly enjoyed the solitude that came with being a chiropractor, even when she'd been able to step back from the demands of her practice during these walks in the park. 

Now, however, with the impending deadline looming over the new building project, and a growing feeling of responsibility for both her patients and the lives she was trying to help through her adjustments, Elara felt adrift.  She stared at the calendar on her desk, marking each patient's scheduled visits in neat lines - each line seemed increasingly daunting as she looked past them, towards an uncertain future.
