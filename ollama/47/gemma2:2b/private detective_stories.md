The rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of Rex "Fingers" Fitzwilliam's office like an angry mob, each drop drumming out a frantic beat. Inside, the air hung thick with cigar smoke, cheap whiskey, and the faint whiff of fear - a potent cocktail that always accompanied his cases.  Rex, known by everyone from his shady clients to his perpetually befuddled secretary as "Fingers" for his knack for picking locks, was staring out at the neon-drenched street below, his face hidden in the dim light of a flickering bulb. The city's heartbeat throbbed around him - sirens, music, shouts, and whispers – yet all he heard were the echoes of the last case he'd lost: Evelyn Thorne's disappearance, swallowed by the maw of the city like a forgotten coin. 

Tonight, though, was different. A woman named Ms. Amelia Grey, a high-society socialite with a voice sharper than a hawk's talon and eyes like shattered ice, had walked into his office. Her silk gown was a crumpled testament to her despair; every movement spoke of a stifled scream. "My husband," she choked out, "He's gone... vanished like a ghost. And the family fortune?" She shuddered, each tremor threatening to unleash a torrent of grief that would swallow her whole. "It all went with him."

**Setting:**  A grimy but charmingly worn-down office building in the heart of New Orleans. It’s a place where jazz spills out from smoky back alleys and fortunes are made and lost on dice games and poker nights, shrouded in secrets whispered under neon signs. 
 
 **Main character:** Rex "Fingers" Fitzwilliam (a private investigator who has seen it all in his years of navigating the murky underbelly of New Orleans)
