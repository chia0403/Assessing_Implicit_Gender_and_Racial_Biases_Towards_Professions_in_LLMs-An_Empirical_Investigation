The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Amelia Sinclair's desk, casting an anemic glow on the meticulously arranged files. Her office at Redwood Ridge Behavioral Health Center was as sterile and ordered as her carefully composed demeanor. The scent of chamomile tea and lavender air freshener filled the room, a fragile attempt to appease the anxieties that simmered just beneath the surface.  It was 7:00 am, the hour when the first wave of patients poured into the waiting room, each with their own burdens to unload, their own struggles to navigate.

Amelia stared out her window at the early morning fog rolling across the San Francisco Bay. It was a picture of serenity, but it did little to ease the knot in her stomach. Her patient today, Mr. Evans, had called his session "the most difficult one heâ€™d ever had."  She'd heard similar words from others, and yet, Amelia couldn't shake the feeling that something deeper lay beneath the surface, a chasm of unspoken anguish that threatened to swallow the man whole.
