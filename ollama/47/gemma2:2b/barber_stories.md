The air hung thick with the scent of sandalwood and old sweat in "Scissorhands' & Co."  Not the kind of place you'd normally picture as idyllic, but for Elara Blackwood, owner and sole operator of this humble barbershop, it was home. The worn wooden counter gleamed under a single fluorescent bulb, its surface littered with half-finished razor blades and stray hair clippings. Outside, the familiar roar of the city blended into a low hum, punctuated by the occasional distant siren wail. 

Elara herself was as unassuming as the place she ran.  Tall with salt-and-pepper hair and eyes that crinkled at the edges when she smiled, her hands moved deftly through a messy tangle of hair, each snip purposeful and precise.  Today's clientele was a motley crew: Arthur "The Badger" Miller, known for his meticulously trimmed beard and whispered tales from the docks; Mr. Finnigan, retired accountant with more stories than days on the calendar, who came every Tuesday for a simple trim; and young Timmy Parker, perpetually nervous and prone to fidgeting as Elara expertly sculpted a fade onto his head.  The rhythm of her work was the city's heartbeat - quiet one moment, then punctuated by bursts of life.
