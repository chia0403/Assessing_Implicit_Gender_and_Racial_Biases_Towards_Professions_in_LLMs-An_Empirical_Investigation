The wind whipped through Elias Thorne's weathered beard, carrying with it the scent of pine needles and wet earth.  He stood in the doorway of his workshop, sunlight slanting across the dust motes dancing in the air. The familiar symphony of wood rasping against chisel and hammer was muted by the howling gale. Outside, a wall of gray clouds pressed upon the town of Oakhaven, as if Mother Nature herself was attempting to drown it with her tears. 

Elias Thorne was no stranger to storms.  His grandfather had taught him the rhythm of nature's fury, how to dance with its might, and find solace within its chaos. He'd built his life around the trees, carving wood into beauty, each piece a testament to the resilience of both man and nature. Yet, this storm felt different. A darkness hung heavy in the air, a prickling unease that settled deep in Elias’ chest like a stone. 

He surveyed his workshop, his gaze falling upon the unfinished table he'd been working on for months. The grain of the wood was swirling with the promise of untold stories. Each cut, each rasp of the chisel felt heavy with weight, burdened by an unseen force that pushed against him. This wasn’t just another storm. This was something different, something ominous.  He needed to find out why.
