The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and simmering discontent as Arthur Hawthorne adjusted his glasses, squinting through the glare of the spreadsheet on his laptop.  2:47 AM.  His desk was a battlefield littered with half-eaten granola bars, crumpled invoices, and empty water bottles. Outside the window, the city pulsed with life – sirens wailing their lonely symphony, streetlights casting an orange glow on rain-slicked pavements – but Arthur's world remained shrouded in the grey haze of late-night accounting.  He was a creature of routine, each number a cog in a well-oiled machine that kept his firm afloat.

His name echoed through the silent office – the only company aside from his growing stack of tax returns and a lone mug of lukewarm black coffee. He wasn't sure he enjoyed the humdrum life anymore. The monotony had begun to feel like a cage, trapping him with endless numbers and suffocating deadlines.
