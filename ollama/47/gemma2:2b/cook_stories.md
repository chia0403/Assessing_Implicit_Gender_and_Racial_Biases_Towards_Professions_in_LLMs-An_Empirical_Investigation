Rain lashed against the windowpane of 'The Salty Pelican', blurring the already murky streetlights into a dizzying kaleidoscope. Inside, the air hung thick with the scent of salt, old wood, and simmering anxieties.  Eloise "Ellie" Beaumont, her apron dusted with flour and worry lines etched deep around her eyes, surveyed the storm brewing both outside and inside her little restaurant. It had been five years since she'd opened The Salty Pelican - a cozy nook serving up hearty seafood dishes to weary travelers and locals alike. Five years of chasing dreams fueled by her grandmother's old cookbook and an undying love for the sea's bounty, yet tonight, it felt as if all that hope was clinging precariously to a single, wilting seashell.

Ellie ran a shaking hand through her auburn hair, catching a glimpse of the storm reflected in its disheveled waves.  She had received the notice earlier: their lease was up for renewal, and they were being offered a meager amount that barely covered rent. With each passing minute, Ellie felt the weight of her predicament grow heavier - the familiar comfort of The Salty Pelican threatened to be swallowed whole by the relentless storm outside and the crushing reality of financial hardship.
