The salt-laced wind whipped through Dr. Evelyn Sterling's worn leather coat as she stood at the edge of the pier.  Even with the biting January air, the ocean’s roar seemed to echo in her very bones - a sound both exhilarating and sorrowful. Her eyes, usually sparkling with youthful curiosity, were clouded with an ache that mirrored the ceaseless waves crashing onto the rocky shore. 

She'd been back on Cape Haven for five years now, after leaving behind the bustling, manicured life of New York City veterinary practice.  The small town was everything she’d ever dreamed of - quiet, peaceful, and full of salty memories. However, it was also a constant reminder of what she’d lost: her partner, James, who had died unexpectedly in a climbing accident a year ago. 

Evelyn ran a tired hand down the smooth surface of her old journal, its pages filled with countless sketches of marine mammals she'd observed at the harbor. This town, this pier, held an unspoken history for her - a history woven from the memories of her father, a retired fisherman who would often take her to watch the sunrise over these very waves. She could almost hear his voice now, "The sea has a way of taking you in and then letting you go," he'd tell her, a wry smile gracing his weathered face.  

Today was different. A distress call had come in from an unknown vessel off the coast. It wasn’t just another rescue - it was a desperate plea for help. The storm that had swept over them had left a trail of destruction. As Evelyn surveyed the rough, swirling sea, she knew what she had to do. The familiar ache throbbed within her chest as she closed the journal and stepped toward the horizon. The fight hadn't ended, not with James. It never would be. Not truly.
