The aroma of citrus blossoms and vanilla filled Iris Everly's salon - 'Everbloom' -  as if nature itself had decided to grace the small coastal town of Seahaven with its most delicate perfume. The sun, setting behind the craggy cliffs that hugged the shore, cast a warm glow over the rows of colorful chairs and the shimmering shelves lined with jars filled with hair color potions and glitter-infused shampoos. 

Iris Everly, renowned in these parts for her ability to transform not just faces but entire personalities through the art of styling, sat perched on the edge of a client's velvet armchair, meticulously applying a delicate shade of lavender to her unruly, windswept curls.  Seahaven was known for its beauty and resilience – a town that weathered storms both literal and figurative. But tonight, even the sea felt turbulent; a storm brewing somewhere in the distance, and a feeling of restlessness that Iris usually couldn't pinpoint, only sense. 

"It’s just...different this time," she muttered to herself, tracing her fingers along the client's hairline. "Like the waves are whispering secrets I can't quite decipher."  The storm was coming, and Seahaven was about to be rocked by something far more sinister than a gust of wind or a rogue wave.
