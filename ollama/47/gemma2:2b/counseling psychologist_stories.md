Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, mimicking the relentless thrumming of anxiety in her patients' minds. The warm, inviting aroma of cinnamon candles did little to subdue the storm raging outside, or the one brewing within herself. Evelyn sighed, running a hand through her already frazzled hair as she reviewed yet another file:  a young woman grappling with the aftermath of a life-altering divorce and an upcoming custody battle. 

Her own marriage – a quiet, long-standing partnership that had seen its fair share of storms – was starting to feel like a ship caught in a tempestuous sea. The whispers of "what ifs" and "maybes" had begun to swirl within her mind, mirroring the chaotic symphony of emotions emanating from the clients she tirelessly helped navigate through. 

Evelyn's office, tucked away on the quieter side of bustling downtown Portland, was a sanctuary of calm amidst the chaos.  She ran her thumb across the worn spine of a paperback titled "The Art of Listening," its words echoing a truth she struggled to apply: sometimes, even the best therapist needs a reminder that life’s currents often require more than simply offering solutions; they need empathy and understanding.
