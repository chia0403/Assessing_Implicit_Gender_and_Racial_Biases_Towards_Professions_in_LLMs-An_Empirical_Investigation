The crimson sun bled out over the horizon, painting the city walls in hues of burnt orange and deep violet.  This was the final hour before dusk, when the once vibrant streetlamps flickered to life like startled fireflies.  Within the stone confines of the City Watchhouse, Captain Reginald "Reg" Hawthorne felt a familiar knot tighten in his chest. He’d spent his entire career patrolling the bustling streets of Veridia – a city that boasted more magic users than any other - and this job, guarding the entrance to the Arcane Bazaar, was proving particularly taxing.  

Veridia's heart throbbed with arcane energy. From the air, the city pulsed with raw magic, visible as shimmering strands in the twilight.  Reg ran a tired hand through his silver hair, the weight of responsibility settling heavily on his shoulders. He watched as the guards changed shifts, a weary group of men and women all bearing the same resigned sigh. The Bazaar itself would soon overflow with citizens from every corner of the city, each one seeking the elusive magic that could either solve their problems or destroy them.  The air was thick with anticipation – a potent mix of hope and despair.
