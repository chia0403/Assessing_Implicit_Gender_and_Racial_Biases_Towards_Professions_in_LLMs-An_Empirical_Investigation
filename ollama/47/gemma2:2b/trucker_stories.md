## The Ballad of Bartholomew "Barty" Bradshaw

**Setting:** The year is 2047.  A sprawling network of hyperloop tunnels crisscrosses the American landscape, carrying goods and people across vast distances with lightning-speed efficiency.  The once-bustling interstates have shrunk into a relic of the past, their concrete skeletons now adorned with wind turbines that whisper promises of a sustainable future. 

**Main Character:** Bartholomew "Barty" Bradshaw, age 52, was a veteran trucker navigating the twilight years of his career. His weathered face, lined like an old leather map, held a lifetime’s worth of stories etched in faded wrinkles. He drove a trusty '67 Chevy semi-truck named "Betsy," its rusted paint job telling tales of countless miles on asphalt and concrete highways.

Barty's route was as predictable as the sunrise: start at his modest trailer park near Salt Lake City, navigate the labyrinthine network of hyperloop stations, then deliver his precious cargo to the bustling port in San Diego. Each trip was a symphony of familiar routines - the hum of the engine, the rhythmic sway of Betsy, and the endless drone of the automated voice announcements guiding him through each station. 

But today, something felt different. An unsettling weight settled on Barty’s shoulders, a gnawing uncertainty that echoed in the stillness of his driver's seat. A message from his family waited on his comms console - an ominous warning about unforeseen events at the docks. Something was amiss.  Something wasn't right.
