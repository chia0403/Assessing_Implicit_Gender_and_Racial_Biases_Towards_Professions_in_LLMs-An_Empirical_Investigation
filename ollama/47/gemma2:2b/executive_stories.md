## Story Opening: 

The crisp air stung Amelia Thorne's nostrils as she stepped onto the balcony of her penthouse office. The city stretched out before her like a glittering tapestry woven from steel and glass, all shimmering in the dying light of a November sunset. Below, the Manhattan skyline shifted into an array of neon colors, each building casting a grotesque shadow against the other. 

Amelia Thorne, Executive Vice President at Titan Holdings, ran a hand over her sleek crimson suit â€“ its fabric as smooth and unforgiving as the granite floors beneath her feet. She had grown accustomed to power and precision, but tonight, a strange unease clung to the crisp air like a damp cloth on her skin. 

Tonight, she felt anything but in control.
