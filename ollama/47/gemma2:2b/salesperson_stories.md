The humid Florida air hung heavy as Elias Thorne adjusted his crisp blue tie and approached Ms. Periwinkle’s immaculate living room. He was already sweating despite the air conditioning, which seemed to be working overtime in this otherwise sweltering space. The house itself was an incongruity – a pastel-colored colonial with delicate ironwork and a sprawling lawn that somehow felt choked by overgrown bamboo.  Ms. Periwinkle's smile was as wide and sharp as her perfectly manicured nails. 

"Elias, darling," she chirped, holding out a steaming cup of iced tea. "Don't you look dashing in your suit!"

His name, Elias Thorne, echoed through the house like an unfulfilled promise. He’d been given this seemingly impossible task – to sell Ms. Periwinkle, one of the wealthiest women in town and a notoriously difficult client, on a set of high-end patio furniture she wouldn’t even look at. 

"Ms. Periwinkle," Elias said, placing his briefcase on the pristine mahogany coffee table, "This is simply not a good fit for your... taste."  The words hung heavy in the air, each syllable a hammer blow against her carefully constructed facade of joy.
