The air in Mrs. Evelyn Winthrop's office hung thick with the scent of old paper and dust motes danced lazily in the shaft of afternoon sun slanting through the tall window panes.  Evelyn, perched on the edge of her worn leather chair, idly swished a pen across the notepad in front of her. The whirring of Mrs. Winthrop’s antique typewriter filled the room, its clacking rhythm a familiar song to Evelyn's ears. But today, the usually comforting symphony was strangely discordant. 

It had only been three months since Evelyn took on this role as secretary to the formidable philanthropist Mrs. Winthrop. The position, with its quiet humdrum and demanding schedule, was one she hadn’t expected at all.  Yet, there was something about the imposing woman's sharp gaze and iron will that had drawn Evelyn in.

Evelyn shifted in her chair, the creak of it announcing her discomfort to the silent room. A tremor ran through her, not entirely from the sudden draft that blew in through the open window. It was a feeling she'd become all too familiar with – a sense of unease, like a shadow lurking just at the edge of vision.  It had started subtly, an unsettling feeling accompanying Mrs. Winthrop's recent silence after their last meeting, but it grew more pronounced lately. 

Evelyn's eyes widened as Mrs. Winthrop’s voice rang out from behind her, "Evelyn, have you received the latest letter?" It was a tone unlike any she'd heard before, laced with something both alarming and unsettlingly... curious. The answer, Evelyn knew, would change everything.
