## Setting: 

The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the sterile white walls of Mercy General Hospital's emergency room. The air hung thick with the scent of disinfectant, anxiety, and the faint metallic tang of blood. It was dusk in Los Angeles, where even the stars seemed to flicker with a restless energy.  

## Character: 

**Evelyn Thorne**, RN, had been a registered nurse for over fifteen years. Her sharp gaze and quick hands were legendary amongst her colleagues. She moved through the chaos with an almost ethereal calmness, tending to patients with the kind of focused attentiveness that bordered on a zen-like acceptance. Tonight, however, the calm was slipping away.  

Evelyn's stethoscopes felt heavy in her hand as she approached the bed of a young woman whose face was etched with pain. Her name was **Isabella Garcia**, and she had been brought in moments ago after suffering a massive seizure. Now, Evelyn could barely make out Isabella's panicked eyes behind a halo of white hair, a silent scream trapped within her throat.  
 
Evelyn took a deep breath, bracing herself for the inevitable. As the young woman's chest heaved with each labored breath, a new kind of fear â€“ a premonition that went beyond the technicalities of her job - washed over Evelyn.  It was as if the very air itself felt heavy with sorrow.
