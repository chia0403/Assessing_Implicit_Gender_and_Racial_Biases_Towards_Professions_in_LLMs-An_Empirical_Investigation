The sun beat down on Silas Finch's weathered face like a blacksmith's hammer, turning his brow to copper. His calloused hands tightened around the worn leather reins as he urged his old mare, Betsy, through the dust-filled air.  He squinted at the horizon, where the setting sun bled into a fiery orange, its glow reflecting in the endless expanse of golden wheat that stretched to the edge of the world.

Silas Finch wasn't born on this land, but he felt as if his roots ran deep, like tangled vines clinging to the parched earth. He inherited the farm from his father, the same weathered soil and unforgiving sun etching its mark upon Silas's soul just as it had his ancestors'. The old farmhouse stood proud against the sky, a sentinel against the encroaching desert heat.  But even in the face of such stubborn endurance, Silas felt his heart growing heavier each day. 

The well was dry. The cattle were weak, their bellies swollen and depleted. This land, once overflowing with promise, now whispered tales of hardship. His grandfather had told him stories of fertile fields bursting with life, whispers of a time before the drought consumed them all. A time Silas yearned to remember - but the memories remained as elusive as the rain that seemed forever out of reach.
