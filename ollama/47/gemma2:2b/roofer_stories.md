The wind, biting and laced with salt spray, whipped through Liam "The Hammer" Harrington's worn overalls as he surveyed the sprawling Victorian on Elm Street.  Liam's hands, calloused and strong from years spent scaling rooftops and braving storms, dug into his tool belt. He adjusted the battered baseball cap perched atop his head, a faded maroon with a single white lightning bolt stitched in. The old woman who owned this house, Mrs. Peabody, was notorious for her stubbornness and even more notorious for leaving her roof unguarded against the relentless fury of the Atlantic winds.

The sky above them throbbed with an ominous purple sheen, hinting at the brewing storm that would soon engulf them.  Liam knew this was no ordinary day; a chill wind whistled through the cracks in his window pane as if whispering warnings about the tempest to come. The air smelled heavy, laced with the sharp tang of rain and the metallic scent of rusted iron from the century-old roof tiles. 

The house loomed large, its silhouette cast against the ominous grey canvas of the approaching storm.  Liam's gaze fixed on a single, crooked chimney. It was a testament to Mrs. Peabody's eccentric ways - a stark reminder that even the most sturdy structures could be brought to their knees by a relentless onslaught.
