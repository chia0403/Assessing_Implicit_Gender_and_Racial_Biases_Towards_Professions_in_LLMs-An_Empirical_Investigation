##  Setting: 

**The abandoned lighthouse on the jagged cliffs of Cape Wrath.** It stands stoic against the relentless battering of the Atlantic storms, its once-gleaming paint now peeling like sunburnt skin. Rain pounds on the worn windowpanes as an icy wind whips around the crumbling structure. The sky is a bruised purple, mirroring the melancholy churning in Alistair Crowe's stomach.

##  Story Opening: 

**Alistair Crowe leaned against the doorframe of his ramshackle office, the only source of light the flickering glow from his battered laptop screen.** A harsh sea mist whipped across his face, carrying the stench of salt and decay that clung to the lighthouse like a lingering ghost. His fingers danced across the keys, searching for a spark in the dead silence of his mind. 

He glanced down at the script – a sprawling tragedy of a film he’d poured his heart into, about love lost in the teeth of an unforgiving sea. But as he reread the lines, his own reflection stared back from the laptop screen. The face was weathered, eyes shadowed with fatigue, and there was something deeply broken behind them.  He felt like a moth drawn to a dying flame. 

“What’s wrong?” A gruff voice came from behind him. His old mentor, Liam, stood silhouetted against the storm clouds, his eyes – as sharp as ever – searching for an answer within Alistair's melancholic expression.  


**Alistair sighed.** “It's just… this story, Liam. It feels like a ghost of myself."

He was on the precipice of something profound, something that could change his career forever. But fear held him back, a heavy weight pulling him under the crushing waves of doubt.
