The crisp mountain air bit at Amelia's cheeks as she adjusted her worn leather boots, their buckles clicking against each other in the quiet pre-dawn stillness.  Sunrise was still hours away, but already the familiar chill of winter had settled into the valley, clinging to everything like a second skin. She inhaled deeply, savoring the scent of pine and damp earth, a sharp contrast to the sterile smells that clung to her clinic back home.

Amelia stepped out of her car and surveyed the small cabin nestled deep within the woods, its paint chipped but its windows still shining with hope. The "Mountain Haven Rehab" sign above the door seemed to hum in defiance of the harsh winter.  Inside, the smell of fresh coffee and disinfectant filled the air as she entered. 

She was a woman born for this life. Ever since she’d graduated top of her class from the University of Colorado, Amelia had yearned for the quiet solitude of the mountains, a stark contrast to the frantic pace of urban life.  There was something liberating about working with patients, helping them reclaim their bodies and rediscovering a sense of self-sufficiency in this wild landscape. 
But today, even the familiar comfort of Mountain Haven couldn't completely drown out the gnawing anxiety that clung to her like frost on a leaf.  Her first patient was an enigma - he’d been sent down from Denver after a fall, and his story was as shrouded in mystery as the winter fog clinging to the valley floor. 
He’d only spoken about wanting to walk again, but Amelia couldn't shake off the feeling that there were deeper wounds beneath the surface, scars too deep for even her keen eye to see.
