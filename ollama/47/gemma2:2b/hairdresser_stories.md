The scent of lilac shampoo hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of bleach and old dreams. Amelia "Amy" Beaumont, her auburn hair cascading down her back like fiery curtains, stood behind the worn mahogany counter in her little salon. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the space, turning dust motes into shimmering specters dancing on the air. Outside, the wind whispered a restless tale through the cracked windowpane, but inside, it was still and silent. A silence that made Amy's skin prickle with anxiety.

She glanced at the reflection in the silver hairspray bottle she held - an image of her own tired eyes framed by wisps of faded red highlights, mirroring the quiet desperation gripping her heart. Three months. It had been three months since Mr. Henderson, her former mentor and confidante, died. Three months since the whispers began.

The "new" Amy Beaumont wasn't ready for the storm she was about to face. Not yet. But soon, there would be no time left to hide.
