The relentless Arizona sun beat down on Earl's weathered face as he straightened a line of orange cones at the edge of mile marker 145.  It was another scorcher of a day like many others before it. A familiar ache pulsed in his aching joints from all the hours spent under this unforgiving sky. The air, thick with dust and diesel fumes, felt heavy on his chest. Earl wiped sweat from his brow with a rough rag, the worn canvas already stained with grime and the remnants of countless meals packed for long shifts. 

He squinted, scanning the endless desert stretching out behind him like an unforgiving expanse of ochre under the glare of the sun.  This was the life he'd chosen, or rather, been forced into – a simple job, seemingly monotonous, just another cog in the machinery of the state’s vast infrastructure project. 

Earl had always felt more at home amongst the steel and concrete than within the confines of his small town. The open road held a kind of freedom he'd never found back home. He yearned for the thrill of completion, the satisfaction of seeing something tangible rise from the earth like an unwavering testament to human ambition. His days were spent building that very thing, one mile marker at a time.
