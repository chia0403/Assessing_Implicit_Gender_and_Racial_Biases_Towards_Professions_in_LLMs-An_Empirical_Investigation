The humid air hung thick and heavy in the cramped, dimly lit office above "Rusty's Repair Shop."  Amelia Hawthorne, her auburn hair pulled back in a tight bun, tapped furiously on her laptop keyboard, its glow cutting through the swirling dust motes dancing in the afternoon sunbeams that slunk in from the broken awning. 

It was another one of those days, she thought, sighing as she looked at the stack of "For Sale" signs crammed onto her desk, each a silent testament to her dwindling optimism.  This quaint little town, with its cobblestone streets and Victorian-era homes, had once held so much promise for Amelia's budding real estate career.  Now, however, even the charm felt brittle under the weight of countless foreclosures and empty promises.

Ameliaâ€™s gaze drifted towards the chipped paint on the doorframe, a faded mural depicting a jovial sun in the center of a sunflower field barely visible beneath layers of dust and grime. Her grandmother had gifted her this very office when Amelia took the leap into the world of real estate after graduating from college with a degree in economics. But sometimes, it felt more like a burden than a blessing.
