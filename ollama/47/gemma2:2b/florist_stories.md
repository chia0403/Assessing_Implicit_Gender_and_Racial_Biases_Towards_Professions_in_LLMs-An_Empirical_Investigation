The humid air hung thick and heavy in Petalburg Florist, making even the bright bouquets feel wilting.  **Elara Thornwood**, her auburn hair pulled back tight against the sweat on her forehead, wiped down the glass display case with a tired sigh. It was 7:00 am, and already, the day felt like it would be swallowed whole by the unrelenting summer heat. 

For Elara, the quaint storefront nestled in the heart of Petalburg, was more than just a job; it was a reflection of her soul â€“ a carefully curated blend of vibrant colour, delicate fragrance, and quiet joy.  Every bloom had a story to tell, each bouquet a whispered prayer for good fortune, love, or even just a moment of solace. But this summer's heat felt different; it thrummed beneath the town's usually placid rhythm, threatening to crack the fragile calm of her beloved shop. 

Elara looked out the window, past rows of blooming hydrangeas and plump roses, towards the bustling city center that seemed a million miles away in its sun-baked haze. She knew a storm was brewing, one she couldn't quite grasp but felt in the way a spider spun her web, tight and precarious.
