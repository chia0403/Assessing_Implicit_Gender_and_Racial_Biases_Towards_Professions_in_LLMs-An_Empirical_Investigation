The air was thick with the scent of sawdust and diesel fumes, a familiar symphony to the ears of Silas "Steel" Peterson as he stood beside the half-completed skeleton of the new apartment building in Chicago's bustling West Loop. The sun, already setting behind the steel-and-glass giants that dotted the skyline, cast long shadows across the construction site.  It was twilight on a Tuesday – and like most Tuesdays, Steel could count on finding at least one unexpected surprise waiting for him as he ventured through his usual routine of laying out materials for the next day's construction.

Silas wasn't your typical Chicagoan. He came from a small town in Wisconsin, where the air was cleaner and the nights were longer, where silence often seemed to hold a secret language. Chicago was everything he wasn't - loud, fast-paced, a constant whirl of motion that never truly slept.  He’d been here for eight years now, carving his place in the city's bustling fabric, his strong hands working tirelessly, forming the very foundation on which this sprawling metropolis built its future. But tonight, something felt different, a weight settling in his chest like a fallen brick. He couldn’t shake off the feeling, a prickle at the back of his neck that hinted at an unusual presence amidst the usual humdrum of construction life. 

The wind began to pick up, rustling through the scaffolding and carrying with it a faint but unmistakable sound - almost like whispers, or maybe a low humming. It was coming from within the partially-built structure, where steel beams clashed in rhythm with a mechanical beat. Steel's eyes narrowed as he surveyed the site; his gaze fell on a single beam that seemed to be pulsating, emitting an eerie glow against the setting sun.
