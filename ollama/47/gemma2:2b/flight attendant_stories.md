##  The Weightless Waltz

**Setting:** The shimmering blue expanse of the Caribbean Sea, just before sunset. The small private plane that carried Amelia "Amy" Pierce, its flight attendant for over a decade, was slowly descending towards the white sand beaches of Saint Lucia. 

**Opening:**

"Second-time visitor to this island, Amy?"  A gruff but surprisingly friendly voice from the front spoke, breaking through the hum of the engine's descent. "First time flying in here since..." he paused, tapping his finger on his worn leather briefcase. "... before the storm."

Amy looked out at the clouds parting like a magician's grand reveal of stars.  She knew what he meant - the notorious 2023 hurricane season had brought a particularly violent tempest to the Caribbean, leaving its mark on every inch of her beloved Saint Lucia. Her usual island routine now involved navigating the wreckage of homes and businesses with a heavy heart alongside her colleagues. But even through the grief and exhaustion, she couldn't help but admire the resilience of this place, just like she admired the spirit that kept her flying.

"It's all... part of life here," Amy answered softly, taking a deep breath to clear her thoughts. Her gaze fell on the passengers, each one holding a story as complicated and beautiful as the island itself. As she finished pre-landing preparations, she couldn’t help but wonder - what would this journey hold for her? Would it be an escape from the storm, or would it reveal something even more profound about the very fabric of life and loss? 


**Amy's character:** Amy is a woman with quiet strength. A veteran flight attendant who has seen too much of life’s fragility, she carries a stoicism that masks a deep compassion for those she serves.  While she enjoys her work and finds peace in the routines, she yearns for something more, perhaps a connection to the island's beauty beyond just serving passengers.
