Rain lashed against the windows of Serenity House, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic swirl of gray and red hues. Inside, the air hung thick with the smell of disinfectant and pine-scented hand soap, a constant companion to Amelia "Amy" Chen's long days. Amy adjusted her worn cardigan, its frayed edge a testament to years spent navigating a career defined by empathy and resilience. Her patients were here for varying reasons - injuries from accidents, strokes that left their bodies incomplete, chronic pain after surgeries. All of them walked through the doors carrying burdens heavier than their limbs. 

Her current focus was on Liam, a young man in his early twenties who had been paralyzed from an accident just a few months ago.  His once bright eyes now held a dull flicker as he stared at the empty space beside him on the therapy table. He'd progressed well with the basics: learning to control his breathing through simple exercises and navigating his body with the help of physical mirrors, but today, Amy saw a flicker of frustration cross his face as he struggled with a new, more complex task - activating a hand-operated prosthetic arm.  As she watched Liam's frustration, Amy felt her own anxieties welling up within her; this was far beyond just exercises and repetition. This was about reclaiming lost control, forging a future where the present moment wasn't dictated by an accident that had forever altered Liam's world.
