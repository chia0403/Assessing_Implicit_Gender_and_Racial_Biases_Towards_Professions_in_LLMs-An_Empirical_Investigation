The air hung thick with the scent of blood, sweat, and wood smoke as Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling expertly wielded his cleaver, slicing through the massive hind leg of a steer.  His shop, 'Sterling's Meats', nestled amongst the ramshackle buildings of Oakhaven, was a testament to generations of butchering traditions passed down from his father, and now, Bart himself, was adding another chapter to that legacy. The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across the worn linoleum floor, making the steel gleams in its reflection.  Outside, a gentle breeze carried the faint chirping of crickets, punctuated by the distant sound of children's laughter from the park.


Bart was a giant amongst men, his shoulders broad and strong, calloused hands capable of wielding knives like they were extensions of himself. But even with his physique and years of honing his craft, he felt a pang of unease today. The silence in the shop felt heavy, almost oppressive. His usual rhythm of chopping meat to the steady beat of old country music was disrupted by an unsettling stillness.  A shiver snaked down his spine as he glanced at the clock. It was past 5 pm, yet the shop remained eerily empty.
