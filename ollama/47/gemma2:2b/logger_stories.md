The morning mist clung to the pines like a lover's embrace, swirling lazily around the cabin nestled deep in the heart of the old growth forest.  It was this time of year, when the air grew crisp and heavy with pine needles, that Silas Blackwood felt most at home.  He was a man who lived his life in the rhythm of nature - the thumps of chainsaws echoing against the silent symphony of leaves rustling in the wind, the smell of fresh-cut wood replacing his usual morning coffee. 

Silas Blackwood wasn't just any logger; he was considered one of the best in the valley.  His weathered hands knew every inch of his equipment - from the delicate way he handled his chainsaw to the precise way he cut down trees without causing a single tremor. His family had been logging for generations, their lives intertwined with the forest’s pulse. And yet, this morning, Silas felt an unsettling unease prickle at his skin. 

He looked out at the towering pines – each one whispering secrets of its own, but tonight's silence was thicker than usual.
