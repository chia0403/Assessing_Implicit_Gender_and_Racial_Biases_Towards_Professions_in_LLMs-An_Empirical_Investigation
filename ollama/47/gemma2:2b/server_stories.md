Rain lashed against the windows of "The Rusty Anchor," mirroring the storm brewing inside Elara Ainsworth. It was her worst shift yet â€“ three tables with the most difficult patrons imaginable. The first had been a group of boisterous businessmen demanding their steaks rare even if it killed them (and, by their insistence on extra ketchup, likely did) and then there were the overly-romantic couple arguing about whether "Romeo and Juliet" was an accurate depiction of true love in modern society. Finally, came the old woman at a corner table, her eyes glazed over as she recited Shakespeare's sonnets to a pack of pigeons that seemed far more interested in crumbs than words.  

Elara sighed, running a hand through her already messy auburn hair. She was about to give up on the last couple of tables when Mr. Peterson, the owner of the restaurant, walked past. His face, usually etched with tired good humor, held an unusual glint. "Elara," he said, his voice surprisingly loud for such a small man,  "I have an idea." 

His eyes locked onto hers, sending a sudden shiver down Elara's spine. The storm outside seemed to pause as if holding its breath. She followed him through the rain-slicked hallway, her heart pounding with both fear and curiosity, waiting to see what this new "idea" of Mr. Peterson's might be.
