## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  The sprawling high school, North Ridge Academy, hummed with an almost unsettling energy on a Friday afternoon. It was a place where cliques formed in the shade of oak trees outside, and whispers snaked through the air like smoke from the ancient chimney that housed Ms. Amelia Hawthorne's guidance office. 

**Character:**  Ms. Amelia Hawthorne, her silver hair neatly pulled back beneath a worn beret, sat perched on her leather-cushioned chair. Her gaze was steady, eyes focused not on the paper in front of her but rather on the swirling storm brewing outside through the arched windows of her office. The weight of another year at North Ridge Academy pressed down on her like an unseen hand, and she couldn't help but wonder if this school held secrets buried deeper than the whispering walls themselves. 

**Opening:**  "There’s something about this place," Ms. Hawthorne murmured to herself, tapping a pencil against her weathered notebook. “A certain… restlessness. Maybe it’s just me." She was used to students' anxieties and whispers of teenage angst, but today felt different. A sense of unease clung to the air, like a fog slowly engulfing the school grounds. 

"They say these hallways hold more than just classrooms," she thought, glancing at a faded photograph tucked away on her desk - a younger version of herself smiling back from a happier time, before North Ridge had become an arena of teenage storms.  A knock echoed from the door, interrupting her musings.  A student, face pale and trembling, stood nervously in the doorway. 

"Ms. Hawthorne?" The student's voice cracked, "Can I see you?"
