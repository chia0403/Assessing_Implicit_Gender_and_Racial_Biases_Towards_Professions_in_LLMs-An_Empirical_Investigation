Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain-soaked streets of New Haven, Connecticut glistened like polished onyx as Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office building, her eyes fixed on the pavement beneath her feet. A late-night coffee had left her hands shaking slightly, but it was nothing compared to the turmoil brewing in her mind.

As a successful lawyer specializing in environmental law, Lexi had seen her fair share of battles between corporations and small-town communities. But this latest case – one that involved a contentious pipeline project threatening the water supply of a rural town just an hour north of New Haven – had her more unsettled than usual.

The city's skyscrapers seemed to loom over her, their steel and glass façades reflecting the flickering streetlights like cold, unforgiving eyes. The sounds of the city – honking horns, chattering pedestrians – receded into the background as Lexi made her way through the crowded streets, her gaze darting between passersby with a mixture of caution and concern.

It was going to be one of those nights.
