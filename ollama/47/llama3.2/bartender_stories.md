Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The dimly lit sign creaked in the gentle ocean breeze as it read "McGillicuddy's Pub" in faded letters. Inside, the air was thick with the smell of saltwater taffy and stale beer, but behind the bar, Amelia Mae McGillicuddy was brewing up a storm. A native of the small coastal town of Ravenswood-by-the-Sea, Amelia had taken over her family's beloved pub after her father passed away, leaving it to her in his will.

As she polished a glass with a white apron wrapped tightly around her waist, Amelia gazed out at the bustling main street. Tourists milled about, snapping photos of the quirky seaside shops and eateries that lined the way. But Amelia knew Ravenswood was more than just a pretty face – it was a place where secrets lingered in every nook and cranny, and where the lines between past and present blurred like the sea mist that rolled in from the ocean.

Amelia's eyes narrowed as she watched a group of rowdy fishermen stumbling out of the pub, their faces flushed with beer and bravado. She'd seen it all before – the boorish tourists, the locals who thought they owned the place, and the strangers who came to town seeking adventure and left with nothing but regrets. But tonight felt different. Tonight, Amelia sensed a change in the air, a sense of restlessness that made her skin prickle.

And then, just as she was about to pour herself another whiskey, the door swung open and a stranger walked in, his eyes scanning the room like he owned it – which, technically, he did.
