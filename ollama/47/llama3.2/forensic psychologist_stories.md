A soft breeze carried the scent of wet earth and decaying leaves through the air, mingling with the hum of the city's nightlife. The neon lights of Pike Place Market reflected off the wet pavement, casting a kaleidoscope of colors across the street.

Sophia, a renowned forensic psychologist with a keen mind for piecing together the darkest of human psyches, pulled her dark brown coat tighter around her shoulders as she gazed out at the city. She had spent countless nights like this one poring over case files and studying the most heinous crimes in the hopes of better understanding the minds that committed them.

As a leading expert in her field, Sophia's work with the Seattle Police Department's Behavioral Analysis Unit often took her into the darkest corners of human nature. Tonight was no exception.
