Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just begun to set over the industrial complex on the outskirts of town, casting a golden glow over the rows of warehouses and factories that lined the dirt road. The air was thick with the smell of grease and asphalt, and the sounds of traffic and construction echoed through the air.

A figure emerged from the crowd of workers gathered at the edge of the site, his worn denim jeans and faded T-shirt a testament to his years of hard work on the job. Jack "Hawk" Hawkins, 32, made his way through the throng of men, his eyes scanning the area for any signs of trouble or unfinished business.

As he walked, Hawk's hand instinctively went to the silver crucifix hung around his neck, a small token from his late mother that he kept close at all times. He had worked on this site for years, and it was more than just a job - it was a way of life. But tonight felt different. Tonight felt like something was off.

The foreman, a burly man named Joe, caught Hawk's eye as he approached the scaffolding that wrapped around the side of the warehouse. "Hawk, we got a problem," he called out, his voice low and urgent. "One of the guys just found a body in the trench."

Hawk's heart skipped a beat as he quickened his pace, his mind racing with possibilities. Who was it? And how had they ended up dead on this construction site?
