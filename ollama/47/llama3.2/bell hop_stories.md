Here's a potential story opening:

---

The neon lights of the city's underbelly cast a gaudy glow over the worn asphalt of Hotel Riviera Boulevard, where the sound of jazz wafted from the lobby and the hum of the refrigerator in the kitchen provided a constant background thrum. It was a place where dreams came to die, where the lost and the lonely found temporary refuge behind closed doors.

Among the hotel's ranks of worn bell hops, room cleaners, and weary waitstaff, one young man stood out: Julian "Juice" Jackson. A native of Brooklyn, Juice had left home six months prior to start anew in the city that never slept, taking on the modest role of a bell hop at Hotel Riviera. With his messy afro and worn denim jacket, he blended into the background, yet possessed an air of quiet confidence that commanded attention.

As the sun dipped below the city's concrete horizon, casting a reddish-orange glow over the hotel's facade, Juice checked his watch for what felt like the hundredth time that night. He had a feeling tonight was going to be one for the books â€“ a night that would change the course of his life forever. Little did he know, the mysterious guest who had just checked in on floor three was about to disrupt the very fabric of Hotel Riviera's mundane routine.
