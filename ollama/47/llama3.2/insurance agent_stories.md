Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle gleamed like polished onyx under the faint glow of streetlights. It was a drizzly autumn evening in late October, and the misty veil that shrouded the city seemed to whisper secrets to those brave enough to venture out into its damp, gray world.

In his sleek, black sedan, insurance agent Julian Everett Wright sat behind the wheel, sipping on a lukewarm coffee as he navigated through the crowded streets.
