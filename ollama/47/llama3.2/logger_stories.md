The misty dawn broke over the small town of Ravenswood, Oregon, casting a golden glow over the dense forest that surrounded it. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves. In a small clearing near the edge of the forest, a lone figure emerged from the trees, his rugged boots kicking up dust and leaves as he made his way to his truck.

His name was Jedediah "Jed" Thompson, a logger who had spent his entire life working in these woods. His thick beard and graying hair were flecked with threads of brown, evidence of years spent outdoors, exposed to the elements. A worn denim jacket hung over his broad shoulders, adorned with pockets filled with tools and trinkets gathered from his days on the job.

As Jed climbed into his truck, a battered old Peterbilt with a faded paint job, he gazed out at the forest, his eyes squinting against the morning light. He knew these woods like the back of his hand, every tree, every stream, and every hidden clearing etched into his memory like the lines on a well-worn map. But today felt different, as if something was stirring beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered.

With a deep breath, Jed started the engine and began to make his way down the forest road, bound for the woods where he would spend the next few days felling trees and making a living from the land he loved. Little did he know, this trip would set him on a path that would change his life forever.
