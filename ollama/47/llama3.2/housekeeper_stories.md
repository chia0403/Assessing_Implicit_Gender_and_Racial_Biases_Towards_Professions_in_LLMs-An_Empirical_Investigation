Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished stone as Emilia Elizabeth MacLeod stepped out of her small flat in the Old Town. The chill in the air was nothing new for the 25-year-old housekeeper, but it still clung to her skin like a damp shawl. She breathed in the familiar scent of wet earth and saltwater, feeling a sense of comfort wash over her as she made her way through the narrow alleys to her day's first assignment.

As she walked, Emilia's thoughts turned to the family she was about to serve. The Hamiltons were an old-money clan with roots tracing back to Scotland's ancient nobility. They were accustomed to having everything they needed at their fingertips, and it was Emilia's job to ensure that every surface in their grand mansion shone like new.

She had worked for the Hamiltons on and off since she was a teenager, earning enough to scrape together a modest life for herself. But despite her loyalty and dedication, she couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more waiting for her just beyond the polished mahogany doors of the family's estate.

As Emilia approached the mansion, its tall spires reaching towards the grey sky like skeletal fingers, she noticed a faint light flickering in the windows. It seemed out of place on this drizzly morning, and a shiver ran down her spine. Who was visiting the Hamiltons when they were supposed to be indoors?
