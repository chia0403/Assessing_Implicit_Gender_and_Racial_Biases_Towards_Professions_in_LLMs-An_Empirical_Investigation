The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the sleepy town of Ashwood, casting a warm orange glow over the cobblestone streets and half-timbered buildings that seemed to lean in, as if sharing secrets. In a small workshop nestled between a bustling blacksmith's forge and a quaint apothecary, Emrys ap Rhys was already hard at work, his skilled hands moving with precision as he shaped and polished the day's batch of limestone.
