Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a counseling psychologist:

Dr. Sophia Elizabeth Thompson stood at the edge of the serene lake, gazing out across the tranquil waters as the last wisps of sunlight danced on the ripples. The cool evening air carried the sweet scent of blooming lilacs, a familiar comfort in this small town nestled deep within the heart of Wisconsin's Northwoods. As a counseling psychologist with a private practice in this tight-knit community, Sophia had grown accustomed to its rhythms and secrets.

The trees surrounding her office, adorned with twinkling string lights that reflected off the lake's surface like fireflies on a summer night, seemed to whisper stories of their own. She'd spent countless hours listening to the residents of Oakwood, a place where everyone knew everyone else's business, and yet still found themselves struggling to navigate the complexities of human relationships.

Sophia took a deep breath, letting the calm atmosphere seep into her bones as she began to prepare for another long night of sessions. The phone on her desk would soon ring with worried calls from families torn apart by conflict, or lonely hearts seeking solace in the dead of winter. It was a familiar refrain, one that Sophia had grown to recognize and respond to with compassion.

As she turned to leave, a soft breeze carried a whisper through the lilacs â€“ a name that made her pause, and a memory that stirred something long buried within her own heart. The evening air seemed to thicken, heavy with anticipation, as Sophia's thoughts drifted towards the secrets Oakwood held, and the mysteries waiting to be unraveled.
