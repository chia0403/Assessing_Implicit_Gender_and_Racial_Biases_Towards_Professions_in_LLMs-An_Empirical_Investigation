Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her car and onto the cracked asphalt of the deserted psychiatric hospital parking lot. The once-grand building loomed before her, its peeling facade a testament to years of neglect. As a clinical psychologist with a specialization in trauma recovery, Lexi had spent countless hours within these walls, working with patients who had been ravaged by their own experiences.

The hospital's closure was a recent development, and the news had sent shockwaves through the local community. The state had deemed it too costly to maintain, citing outdated infrastructure and dwindling patient populations. For Lexi, however, the hospital held more than just memories – it represented a personal connection to her own past.

As she gazed up at the imposing structure, Lexi felt an unsettling sense of déjà vu. It was as if she was being called back to a part of herself that had been left behind, long ago. The summer air was heavy with the scent of blooming lilacs and decay, a potent reminder of the hospital's dark history.

With a deep breath, Lexi shouldered her bag and began to make her way towards the entrance. She had received an unexpected phone call from the hospital's administrator, inviting her to return for a meeting. The reason was unclear, but Lexi suspected it might have something to do with the recent closure. Her curiosity – and a dash of trepidation – propelled her forward, into the unknown.

What happens next?
