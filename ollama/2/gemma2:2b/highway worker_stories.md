The relentless Texas sun beat down on Clayton "Mac" McClaren's neck like a blacksmith's hammer, driving a fiery rhythm against his callused skin. He shielded his eyes with his hand as he bent over to tighten a bolt on the newly paved lane of US-281, its shimmering asphalt glinting under the unforgiving sky.  He shifted his gaze from the road, where a blur of red brake lights and dust devils danced in the heat haze, to the weathered truck parked at the edge of the ditch. Its chrome gleamed like a mirage. The truck's name was emblazoned on its side in faded silver: 'Rosie'.

Mac’s calloused hands traced the faded lettering as he leaned back against the battered trailer.  The engine hummed softly, a familiar lullaby to his aging ears. He knew Rosie better than most; had learned her rhythms over years of hauling supplies and mending roads in this sprawling landscape where time seemed to melt under the searing Texan sun. His boots kicked up dust as he closed his eyes, the rhythm of the truck’s engine weaving through his soul like a forgotten song. 

He was alone, just like always.  That’s how it'd been for years since the accident that left him, and his wife Martha, forever changed. This highway stretch, with its endless asphalt ribbon, was where he sought solace, where his spirit could be at peace. But tonight, even the steady hum of Rosie seemed different, somehow louder, echoing a deeper unease in Mac's chest than usual.
