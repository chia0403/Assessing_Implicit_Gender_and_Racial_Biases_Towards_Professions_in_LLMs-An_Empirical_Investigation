The aroma of aged leather and peppermint hung thick in the air of Dr. Ethan Westcott's office.  Dust motes danced in the sunbeams slicing through the high windows, illuminating the worn leather chairs and stacks of books overflowing from ornate wooden shelves. Outside, the rhythmic hum of city traffic was a backdrop to the quiet symphony of human suffering that played out within these walls. 

Ethan sat behind his desk, fingers drumming on the polished surface of the mahogany, his brow furrowed as he studied the X-ray projection in front of him. The patient’s name, "Amelia," scrolled across the screen: a young woman whose spine was contorted into an unnatural angle, the result of years spent hunched over a drafting table, her life consumed by the relentless pressure to create. Amelia wasn't just suffering from physical pain; she carried the weight of her career on her shoulders,  the unspoken burden of societal expectation. 

As Ethan adjusted his glasses, he couldn’t help but feel a pang of empathy for the woman in the image. It was not simply about alignment and adjustment - it was about restoring harmony to a life where even the smallest movements were met with resistance, a rebellion against the physical limitations imposed by her own ambition.
