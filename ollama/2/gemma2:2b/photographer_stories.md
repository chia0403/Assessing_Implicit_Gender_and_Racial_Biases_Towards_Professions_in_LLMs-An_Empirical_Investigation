##  Dust & Dreams

The air hung thick with humidity, clinging to Amelia Thorne like a damp shroud as she stepped into the cramped studio. Outside, monsoon rains lashed against the corrugated iron roof, each drop echoing off the chipped and faded paintwork of the room's interior. The faint scent of jasmine perfume mixed with the stale smell of old film stock lingered in the air, a familiar fragrance that Amelia associated with both creation and decay – like memories trapped within dusty negatives.

Amelia, ever restless, was drawn to places where time seemed to fold in on itself. Her camera bag slung across her shoulder, she surveyed the room, its cluttered shelves overflowing with vintage lenses, forgotten tripods, and a tangle of wires that reminded her of childhood fascination with electrical circuits. 

The name "Amelia Thorne" scrawled on an aged wooden sign above the door was faded enough to be almost invisible in the dim light. But Amelia saw it clearly – she knew this room. She had created this space for herself, a haven from the chaos and noise that seemed to cling to every corner of her life. It was here she felt most alive, surrounded by echoes of the stories waiting to be told through her lens. 
 
This city, Calcutta's sprawling maze of narrow streets and hidden courtyards, was where she lived, worked, and dreamed, where stories whispered from the dusty corners, begging to be captured on film.  And Amelia, with her unyielding curiosity and her unflinching eye, sought them out.
