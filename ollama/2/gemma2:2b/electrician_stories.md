The rain hammered down on the rickety wooden awning above Elias' head as he surveyed the mess before him. It was supposed to be a straightforward job: replacing the faulty wiring in Mrs. Hemlock's Victorian mansion. Instead, it felt more like being trapped inside a decaying museum of gothic architecture and creaking floorboards.  The house had been passed down through generations, each owner adding their own idiosyncrasies, from ornate chandeliers that clattered ominously with every gust of wind to portraits of long-dead ancestors staring accusingly from the walls.

Elias, known affectionately by his friends as "Electric Elias," was a man who thrived on order and logic â€“ two things that were decidedly absent in this particular nightmare. His thick brown hair seemed to blend into the gloom cast by the flickering gaslight above him, while his calloused hands tightened around the wrench. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and dust, the ghosts of long-gone maids whispering secrets as he moved through each room. His name echoed in the silence: "Elias Blackwood," a name whispered on dusty corners and forgotten stories.

The flickering gaslight cast monstrous shadows as Elias began to work. It was more than just faulty wiring; it felt like something was watching him, something ancient and unsettling that lurked beneath the ornate wallpaper and faded portraits. The tension in his shoulders tightened with every flicker of the flame, a chill crawling up his spine despite the stifling summer heat.
