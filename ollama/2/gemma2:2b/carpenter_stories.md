The rain hammered against Silas Thorne's workshop windows like tiny fists pounding on wood. Inside, sawdust danced in the fading light of the dying sun, swirling through the air as though a miniature storm had broken loose.  Silas hunched over his workbench, the worn grain of his oak hand-plane humming a familiar melody in the stillness. He was a man forged from rough edges and sharp tools, a carpenter whose life echoed the weathered rhythm of his craft.

Outside, the world was cloaked in an icy gray gloom, mirroring the storm brewing within him. His latest commission - a custom-made chest for a young couple who'd recently moved to town - had gone terribly wrong. It wasn't just that he hadn't finished it on time, though the deadline had been tight and his nerves frayed. No, this was personal.  He’d felt the sting of rejection from them – their words laced with disappointment that somehow cut deeper than any wood-chisel could ever dream of carving.

"There's a reason why they call these storms 'squalls'," Silas muttered to himself, wiping sweat off his brow as he inspected the unfinished chest. A small piece of charred oak stood out like a scar on its once pristine surface –  the result of a momentary lapse in concentration and too much pressure on the old metal press.

His gaze fell upon a framed photograph nestled among the tools - a picture of a smiling girl, with hair that mirrored his own son's. A boy he had vowed to see through, but life, like the wood itself, was always unforgivingly dense and unpredictable. His eyes welled up, the memory of her laughter echoing in the silence. 

And somewhere deep within the heart of the storm, a new kind of pressure began to build: the weight of his unfinished legacy.
