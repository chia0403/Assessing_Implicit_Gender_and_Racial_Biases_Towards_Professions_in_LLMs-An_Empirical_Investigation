The neon "open" sign above Amelia's head buzzed like a tired bee trapped in a jar, its cheerful glow failing to penetrate the perpetual gloom that had become her Monday morning routine.  She was just 19 and felt as though she’d been stuck behind the cash register at The Emporium for eternity, surrounded by shelves crammed with vintage record albums and dusty books – relics of forgotten dreams and whispered stories.  

Amelia’s name tag read "Amelia," written in a font that looked like it had seen better days. She sighed, pushing aside a stray flyer advertising “Rare Vinyl Week” with her foot - the irony was lost on no one as she stared at her own reflection in the glass display case behind her. Her uniform was mismatched and her hair was a tangled mess. The only thing keeping this routine from driving Amelia to distraction was the faint hum of the antique cash register, its brass buttons whispering secrets as customers came and went. 

Her shift at The Emporium had started with an unsettling quiet – not unusual in the early hours, but today felt different. It was almost as if the very air was holding its breath.  It wasn't until a woman in a flowing black coat, her eyes masked by a wide-brimmed hat, approached the register that Amelia truly felt the oppressive weight of silence.
