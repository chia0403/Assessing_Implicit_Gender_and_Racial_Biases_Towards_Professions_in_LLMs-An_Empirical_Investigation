The brass bell above the grand doors chimed softly as Eloise Beaumont, her crisp white uniform practically vibrating with the energy of a hummingbird about to take flight, greeted each guest with practiced warmth. It was 8:05 AM, and the sky outside the penthouse suite's floor-to-ceiling windows had just begun to blush orange with the promise of a sunrise as breathtaking as the city it faced.  

Eloise's world was one of hushed voices, polished silverware, and whispered secrets in the gilded cage of the Astor residence. As concierge at 107 Astor, she knew each resident by heart - their quirks, their routines, their unspoken desires. Even the dust bunnies that gathered on the Persian rug in Mrs. Van Derlyn's study seemed to whisper tales about her past life, a childhood spent dreaming of grand adventures and a future far beyond the confines of this polished ivory tower.

Today was different. A hush had settled upon the usually bustling lobby.  Even the clock chimed with an unfamiliar urgency, its steady beat echoing in Eloise's ears like a siren's call. The air hung heavy, pregnant with unspoken tension and anticipation. And then, she heard it - a knock on the heavy oak door of the grand staircase, followed by a voice that chilled her to the core. 

"Mr. Astor?"  The words, clipped and cold, seemed to carry the weight of the unknown. Eloise gripped the worn brass handle of her intercom, her heart thumping against her ribs like a frantic bird trapped in a cage. "And Miss Beaumont."
