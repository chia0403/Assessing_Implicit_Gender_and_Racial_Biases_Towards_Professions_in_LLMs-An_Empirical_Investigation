Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Amelia Thorne's tiny therapy office, mimicking the relentless rhythm of her thoughts.  The storm outside was mirrored within her own heart – an icy ache that refused to subside since Mr. Henderson fell at the park last week. He was recovering, but not quickly enough. His shattered ankle had become a constant reminder of his fragility, and Amelia’s mind, fueled by both compassion and frustration, struggled to find answers beyond the prescribed exercises and ice packs. 

Amelia took a deep breath, trying to focus on the patient files spread across her desk. She was in an era of technology where physical therapists were expected to be data-driven and innovative, yet Mr. Henderson's case felt like a stubborn echo from a bygone era – one where touch, intuition, and a genuine connection with patients held more weight than any algorithm or biomechanical analysis.  

The storm outside intensified, throwing her little office into an even more somber state of darkness. But it was then that she heard the rhythmic tapping against the window pane. The sound wasn't like the wind; it wasn’t like a raindrop hitting glass. It was… almost melodic. Like a secret message whispered by nature itself.
