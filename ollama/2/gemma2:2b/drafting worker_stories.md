The air hung thick with sawdust and the smell of fresh-brewed coffee, like an old coat hanging in the closet after summer's end.  Dust motes danced in the late afternoon sunlight streaming through the skylight of the drafting room. It illuminated the chaotic tableau of metal drawers spilling over blueprints, stacks of paper notebooks piled precariously on the wooden desk that held a battered but reliable drafting table.  There was no escaping the symphony of clattering tools and hushed voices, all contributing to the rhythmic hum of construction work taking place in their old, cobbled-together workshop outside the city. This was where Elias Thorne, a draftsman who lived for the intricate dance between lines and curves on paper, felt most alive. 

Elias was hunched over his table, his thick brown hair falling into his tired eyes as he meticulously drew out the details of a building design. A half-eaten sandwich rested precariously on his knee, its bread now an uneven slope from years of nibbling. The blueprint for the Grand Citadelâ€™s new wing -  a towering structure Elias would see rise into the heart of the city - lay open before him. Each line was another step towards realizing a vision that felt like more than just work; it felt like life, and he knew this building's creation would define his legacy, even if it only served as another brick in the ever-growing wall of progress.
