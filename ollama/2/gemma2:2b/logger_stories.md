The fog clung to Blackwood Bay like a wet shroud, swirling in the dying light of the August sun. The air hung thick with the scent of salt spray and pine needles, each exhale painting a grey-hued trail across the otherwise serene landscape.  Elias "Eagle" Thorne, weathered face obscured by the shadows cast by his worn flannel shirt and a hat pulled low over his eyes, scanned the distant line where the dense woods met the churning sea. 

For twenty years, Blackwood Bay had been his sanctuary, its rough beauty mirrored in his own hardened spirit. He'd known every twist of this forest path like the lines on his own hand, knew how to coax the trees into submission with only a practiced swing of the axe. His life was rhythm - the rustle of leaves, the crack of wood against steel, and the relentless ebb and flow of day in Blackwood Bay.

But tonight, there was something different in the air. A subtle shift in the wind, an unnatural stillness that crept beneath the surface of the familiar calm. It felt wrong, a tremor in the symphony of nature's song that sent a chill down Elias' spine.
