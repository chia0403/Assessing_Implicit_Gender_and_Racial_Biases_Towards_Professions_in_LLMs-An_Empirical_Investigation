The neon sign outside "Sable's Salon" buzzed with a tired orange hum, casting an almost sickly glow on the rain-slicked pavement. Inside, Amelia Sorenberg, otherwise known as "Sable," ran her fingers lightly over the worn velvet of the back chair, smoothing out a stray crease.  It was pouring outside, the kind of downpour that made even the most seasoned New Yorkers want to hole up in their apartments with a steaming cuppa. 

Amelia's usual Saturday afternoon was usually filled with chattering women, excited chatter about wedding gowns and the latest beauty trends, the gentle whirring of hairdryers, and the comforting scent of floral shampoo. But today felt different. A quiet hum settled over her like the city's early evening sigh.  It seemed even the bustling life sheâ€™d built in her salon hadn't managed to penetrate the strange fog that clung to this storm.

There was a new kind of tension in the air, an unspoken weight that made Amelia feel like she was navigating a sea with invisible currents. She knew it wouldn't be long before her usual clientele would start flooding through the door, their anxieties and woes waiting patiently in a lineup for some semblance of normalcy. But for now, all she could do was wait, watching as the storm raged on outside, mirroring the tempest brewing inside her own soul.
