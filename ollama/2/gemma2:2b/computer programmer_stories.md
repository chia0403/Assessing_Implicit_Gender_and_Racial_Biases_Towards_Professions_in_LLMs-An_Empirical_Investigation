Rain lashed against the windows of Ethan "E-Tech" Carter's tiny apartment, mimicking the ceaseless drumbeat of his anxiety.  The neon glow of the city outside pulsed like a heartbeat, each streetlight throwing long, distorted shadows that danced across his worn laptop screen. He was staring at a single line of code, a jagged scar cutting through the pristine white sheet of HTML: 

```
ERROR: Missing parameter - "user_name"
```

Ethan rubbed his tired eyes. The deadline for the project – a revolutionary new social media app he called "Evolve" – loomed like a thundercloud on the horizon.  He had poured every ounce of energy, every late night and weekend, into its development. It was meant to be the answer to humanity's thirst for connection in a world drowning in digital isolation. But now, with only a week left before launch, it felt more like a sinking ship. 

His apartment, once a haven of creative chaos, now reeked of burnt coffee and mounting desperation. The air was thick with worry, the kind that clung to you like cobwebs after a thunderstorm. Ethan’s fingers hovered over the keyboard, his mind a vortex of conflicting thoughts and half-formed solutions. 

He needed something - anything - to jumpstart this project. A spark. A breakthrough.  A chance at saving himself, and perhaps even humanity itself.
