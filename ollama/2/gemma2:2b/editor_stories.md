The air in the cramped office felt thick with the scent of old paper and stale coffee. Sunlight, filtered through dusty blinds, illuminated motes dancing across the worn wooden floorboards. This was Amelia Thorne's domain - a world where deadlines whispered like the wind outside, and words were weapons wielded with precision and cunning. 

Amelia, her brow furrowed as she hunched over a stack of rejection letters, ran a tired hand through her unruly auburn curls. Her fingers skimmed over the familiar red "reject" stamp, each time sending a pang of frustration through her. For months, every story that crossed her desk had felt like a fight she couldn't win. 

The city outside throbbed with life â€“ a symphony of traffic horns and street vendors hawking their wares - but Amelia found herself lost in the labyrinthine world of fiction. She was surrounded by countless stories, each one vying for a spot on the final page, yet none of them seemed to belong. A single sentence echoed through her mind, like a faint lullaby sung by an unseen ghost: "We live in the spaces between the lines."
