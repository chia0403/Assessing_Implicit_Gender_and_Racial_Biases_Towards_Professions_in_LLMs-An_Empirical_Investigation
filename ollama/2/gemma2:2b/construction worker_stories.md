The air hung thick and heavy with dust and the smell of diesel as Silas "Stumpy" McHenry adjusted his welding mask.  It was supposed to be a beautiful summer night in Portland, Oregon, the kind where the sky bled into orange and purple at sunset, painting the city in streaks of vibrant light. But tonight, even the sun's last rays couldn't pierce through the gloom that had settled over the construction site for the new urban apartment complex. 

Stumpy wasn't sure what it was about this particular project that had him feeling so unsettled. Maybe it was the way the steel beams seemed to stretch towards the inky expanse of the sky, or maybe it was just his own gnawing sense of foreboding. Whatever it was, the silence felt thick and oppressive, punctuated only by the rhythmic clang of metal against metal from miles away.  The construction site itself wasn't a typical haven for night-time exploration - but Stumpy had always found himself drawn to its quiet solitude, his worn work boots echoing across the concrete slab under the moonlit sky. 

He glanced up at the imposing silhouette of the new building rising against the twilight. Its stark lines and unforgiving angles were a stark contrast to the familiar curves and warmth of their older homes, reminding him that progress often came with a sense of loss.  It was in his blood - a legacy he carried on his broad shoulders, from father to son to grandson. A legacy woven from sweat, steel, and the quiet rhythm of building something new.
