The fluorescent hum of the clinic's lights was the only music Amelia “Amy” Henderson had for company as she prepared for another day in the vein-hunting wasteland that was the 3rd floor.  Her steely blue scrubs and surgical gloves felt too formal, even on a Tuesday. She sighed. The name tags were still stuck on their respective pockets: "Mr. Jones" (again), "Ms. Smith" (always so anxious about her blood pressure), "Mrs. Davis" (never missed an opportunity to complain). Amy's mind drifted, picturing the sprawling city skyline and the bustling life that lay beyond the sterile walls of the clinic. Today's schedule was already a mess - a young boy with a mysterious rash, a frantic grandmother clutching a crumpled pink slip, a man who swore he had no idea what year it was.  

It was always something. Amy’s phone buzzed on her desk - a message from her niece Sarah, "I'm at the park! Come for lunch." 

Amy closed her eyes briefly, her mind already making plans for a day filled with sunshine and laughter (and maybe some homemade cookies). The setting sun cast long shadows over the city’s skyline. Today, she would see Mrs. Davis’ worry melt into gratitude as Amy's needle pierced the vein, followed by a warm smile. It was going to be okay.
