## The Whispering Woods

**Setting:** Deep in the heart of Redwood National Park, where ancient giants towered over the forest floor like silent sentinels. Sunlight dripped through the emerald canopy, dappling the moss-covered ground in emerald and gold. 

**Character:**  Amelia "Amy" Willowbrook, a woman whose gentle hands knew the language of every creature she cared for. Her auburn hair was streaked with silver, framing eyes that held the wisdom of years spent beneath the watchful gaze of the redwood trees. At 62, Amy still moved like the wind in the pines – light and graceful, her weathered face a testament to the countless seasons she had witnessed.

**Opening:**  A cold morning breeze whistled through the Redwood canopy as Amy knelt beside the watering hole, the gentle murmur of water cascading down into the earth. It was always a calming symphony for her, one that brought with it the soft echo of memories. Memories of children's laughter echoing in its depths, or of the quiet joy on her own granddaughter's face as she watched the deer drink, their young ones bounding behind them like playful sprites. 

Her heart ached slightly at the absence of those joyous moments this morning. She had been entrusted with the care of Willow Creek's herd for the past 20 years, ever since inheriting her grandfather's love and respect for the redwoods. But tonight was a special night - her granddaughter's graduation ceremony, an event she wouldn’t be able to attend.  

As if sensing her melancholy, a low rumble echoed through the forest – not from the wind or the earth itself, but a deep-throated growl that seemed to emanate from the very heart of the redwood giants. A wave of unease washed over Amy, an instinctual warning she couldn’t ignore.
