## The Dust Motes & the Missing Clock

The air in Blackwood Manor clung to Amelia like an old, damp sweater - heavy with the scent of lavender polish and lingering memories.  Her worn boots tapped against the polished mahogany floorboards, each step echoing in the cavernous space of the vast drawing room. As Amelia dusted the ornate silver clock on the mantlepiece, a shiver ran down her spine. Not from the chill; this was Blackwood Manor's usual autumn gloom. No, it was something deeper – an unnameable sense of dread that clung to her like cobwebs. 

Amelia's hands, calloused and strong, were nimble despite their age.  She'd been a housekeeper at Blackwood Manor for nearly twenty years, ever since she inherited the role from her late mother. It wasn’t glamorous work – dusting, cleaning, mending, and caring for the rambling house in its quiet decay. But it was a job that kept her grounded, a constant, reliable beat in the chaotic symphony of life. 

Tonight, though, something felt different. A strange silence hung over the house like an unraveled thread. Even the usual rustle of the wind in the ivy-covered walls seemed to hold its breath. And then she saw it - the missing clock face, lying half-submerged in a sea of dust motes that danced in the dying afternoon light. It wasn't just the missing face; it was the silence – and the inexplicable sense of wrongness - that made her feel like the house itself had gone quiet.
