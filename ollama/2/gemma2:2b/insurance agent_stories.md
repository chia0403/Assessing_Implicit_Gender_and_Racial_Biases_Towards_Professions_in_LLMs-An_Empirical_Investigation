Rain lashed against the windows of  Ethan "Ebby" Blackwood's office, each drop echoing like a staccato beat against the glass. The storm outside mirrored the turmoil brewing within. Ebby stared at the mangled remains of his latest client's car, sitting slumped in the middle of his cluttered downtown insurance agency. He was supposed to be comforting them through this ordeal, but instead felt an icy knot form in his stomach. 

This case wasn't just a routine collision; it was a personal tragedy.  The victim, Mrs. Henderson, had been a kind-hearted woman who ran the local bakery for years, her face always creased with a warm smile and flour-dusted cheeks. Ebby knew her well - he'd built his career on helping people like her navigate the complexities of life's inevitable twists and turns. Now, she was gone, leaving behind a gaping hole in both the town and his own life. 

The weight of Mrs. Henderson's death, coupled with the sheer brutality of the accident, had been too much for Ebby. He yearned to run, to disappear into the storm like the woman he had so dearly lost. Yet, responsibility tugged at him - not just for Mrs. Henderson and her family, but also for the weight of justice that seemed to hang heavy in the air around the shattered remains of her car. 


**Setting:**  A bustling downtown area with a mix of old architecture and modern buildings. The office is small, filled with quirky antique furniture and overflowing with stacks of policy documents. Ebby's desk holds several worn leather-bound journals, each containing handwritten notes and seemingly endless lists of clients and claims - remnants of his years spent navigating the intricacies of life insurance. 


**Character:** Ethan "Ebby" Blackwood - an earnest, yet somewhat melancholic insurance agent. Ebby is known for his empathy, a trait that often allows him to find common ground with even his most difficult clients. He is deeply affected by tragedies he witnesses and feels a responsibility to help those in need navigate the bureaucratic maze of insurance claims.
