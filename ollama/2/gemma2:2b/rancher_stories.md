The wind whipped around Jebediah "Jeb" Carter's weathered face, carrying with it the scent of sagebrush and dust.  He stood at the edge of his property line, squinting into the blazing afternoon sun that beat down on the parched earth. His eyes skimmed over the land, a vast expanse of rolling hills and scrub brush where cattle grazed lazily, their hooves drumming out an endless rhythm against the dry earth. The setting sun bled across the horizon, painting the sky in hues of fiery orange and deep violet.  This was the heart of the Wyoming plains, the place where Jeb had toiled his entire life, building a life for himself and his family. Yet, a knot of unease tightened in his chest as he looked out over the desolate landscape, wondering when the drought would end and the rains would come back. 
 
Jeb was not just any rancher;  he was known throughout the state for his stubbornness, his love for the land, and his unwavering commitment to his ranch and family â€“ a legacy passed down through generations.  But lately, that legacy felt shaky, vulnerable like the dry earth beneath his feet. A chill crept into his bones as he remembered his father's words: "A rancher lives with the land, son," he used to say, his voice gravelly with age, "and it gives you both comfort and fear." And Jeb knew right now that fear was winning out.
