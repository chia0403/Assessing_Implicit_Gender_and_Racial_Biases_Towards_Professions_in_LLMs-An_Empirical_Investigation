The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Evelyn Thorne's head as she paced the sterile floor of Mercy General Hospital's emergency room.  Night had fallen outside, painting the sky in shades of bruised purple and fiery orange, but inside it felt cold and clinical. A constant stream of anxious faces rushed past her: mothers clutching toddlers, young men with shadowed eyes, and old women gripping wrinkled hands in silent despair. All seeking answers, all hoping for a resolution.  

Evelyn's mind buzzed with worry. It was 3 am on Wednesday night, an unusual time to find herself wrestling with life-or-death decisions – especially not for a doctor who preferred the comforting routine of her small-town clinic. But this was Mercy General, a behemoth known more for its sprawling hallways and chaotic atmosphere than for its calm efficiency. This was where the city's pulse beat strongest, a heart that throbbed with life...and pain. 

Her gaze fell on the new arrival – a young man slumped against the far wall, his body shrouded in shadows from the doorway. He looked barely out of school clothes, and something about him seemed to radiate an almost unbearable sorrow. The file in her hand read "John Doe," yet Evelyn knew it wasn't just a code. It was another story waiting to be told, another life caught in the tangled threads of fate.
