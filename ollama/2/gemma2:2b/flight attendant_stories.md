The humid air clung to Amelia Hayes like a second skin as she surveyed the teeming mass of passengers spilling out onto the tarmac.  She adjusted her crisp uniform, the familiar buttons and stripes feeling somehow less comforting in this chaos.  Her smile, usually bright and ready, felt strained; the 8:00 PM flight from Miami to New York was already an hour delayed, a constant drone of frustration vibrating through the passengers' collective anxiety.  The only thing that felt remotely normal was the gentle hum of the plane’s engines as it sat on the tarmac, waiting for them.  Amelia took a deep breath and turned her attention to the chaotic symphony of boarding, a familiar but nonetheless jarring soundtrack of rushed conversations and slammed bags.
