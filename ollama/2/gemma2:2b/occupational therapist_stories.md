The humid air clung to Evelyn "Eve" Blackwood like an unwelcome second skin.  Her sandals squelched on the cracked asphalt as she walked down the narrow street in the heart of Puerto Vallarta's historic district.  It was her third month working at Casa Esperanza, a small rehabilitation clinic tucked away amongst colorful colonial houses and vibrant flower vendors. The air hummed with laughter and conversation, punctuated by the rhythmic clang of metal against metal from a nearby blacksmith's forge. 

Eve’s gaze drifted to the towering wrought iron gates surrounding the sprawling courtyard. Each gate held an intricately carved image of a mythical creature, their eyes gazing out over the seemingly endless landscape beyond. The clinic was nestled within this fantastical haven, where time seemed to slow and anxieties melted away like ice cubes in a summer storm.  

Eve's patient for the day lay sprawled on the wooden table by the window, her body a symphony of contortions. Elara Vargas, a 10-year-old girl with vibrant green eyes and braids that shone like spun gold, had been born with cerebral palsy that left her unable to walk or talk clearly.  Today’s session focused on improving Elara's hand-eye coordination for tasks like buttoning shirts. Eve knew that this seemingly mundane activity held immense significance for Elara, who yearned to wear the elegant dresses she saw her grandmother create in their vibrant colors and intricately woven patterns.
