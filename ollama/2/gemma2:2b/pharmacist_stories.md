## Opening & Setting:

**Opening:** Rain lashed against the leaded glass windows of "The Filling Station," an old pharmacy that had been in Mrs. Elara Blackwood's family for generations.  The aroma of lavender and old paper clung to the air like forgotten memories, a comforting weight in the chaos of the storm outside.  

**Setting:** 1940s America - The bustling city of New Haven holds onto its small town charm despite the ever-growing shadows of war. Mrs. Elara Blackwood (known affectionately as "Ellie" by her loyal clientele) runs a modest but beloved pharmacy, tucked away on Elm Street, serving generations of families and nursing a deep-seated aversion to anything that couldn't be cured with a pill and a good dose of elbow grease.


**Main character:**  Elara Blackwood, a woman who lived and breathed the world she created within the walls of "The Filling Station." She was a force of nature, her sharp eyes missing nothing, her hands nimble as ever, dispensing medicine with an almost mystical touch. Ellie was a contradiction - quiet and introspective one moment, then bursting into action the next, her sharp tongue cutting through any pretense, always ready to fight for her patients or defend the sanctity of her pharmacy from any intrusion. 


**Potential conflict:** A mysterious man in a dark overcoat arrives at "The Filling Station," seeking something more than just a cough syrup and a smile. His presence throws Ellie off balance, stirring long-buried anxieties and questions about both her family history and the quiet life she'd always known.
