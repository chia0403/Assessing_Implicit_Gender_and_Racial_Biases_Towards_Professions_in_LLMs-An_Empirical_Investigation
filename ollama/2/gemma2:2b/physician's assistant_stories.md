The late afternoon sun, slanting through the stained-glass windows of the clinic, cast fractured rainbows across Dr. Amelia Moreau's already cluttered desk.  It was always like this at the end of a shift in Elmwood: remnants of lives lived and stories untold scattered across surfaces that seemed to demand more than just a quick clean. The weight of it all, the unspoken histories behind each patient file, was almost tangible. 

Amelia, her nametag reading "PA Amelia Moreau," tugged at the collar of her scrubs - the same faded blue they'd worn for the past decade - as she started sorting through the stacks. Her gaze fell on a thick envelope nestled in a pile marked with Dr. Evans's familiar scrawl: "Emily Crandall, 8pm tomorrow." Amelia sighed.  It wasn't the patient, or her assignment that bothered her; it was the growing sense of inevitability hanging in the air like an unseen storm cloud. 

Elmwood. A sleepy town built on the edge of the Appalachians, where secrets lingered thicker than the coal dust that seemed to cling to the very fabric of life. It was a place where time flowed differently, where families stayed bound by generations-old stories and unspoken burdens, waiting for something...inevitable. 


**Setting:** Elmwood, a small town nestled in the foothills of the Appalachian Mountains. Its quiet streets hold whispers of a past that refuses to stay buried, and its inhabitants carry their secrets like weathered stones on a worn path.
