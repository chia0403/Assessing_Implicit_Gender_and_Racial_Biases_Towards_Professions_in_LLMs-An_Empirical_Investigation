The humid air hung thick and heavy over Maplewood High School like a damp shroud, clinging to Ms. Evelyn Hawthorne's tweed jacket as she stood before her classroom door.  A wave of teenage energy pulsed from behind the glass. Even on a Monday afternoon, there was a frenetic buzz in the hallways, students shuffling through the doors with backpacks strapped firmly to their shoulders and eyes glued to their phones. 

Evelyn felt a familiar pang of longing as she watched them. Her own life felt like a faded photograph, stuck in time.  The crisp autumn air that once promised so much was now only a reminder of all the things she'd hoped to achieve. A smile tugged at her lips, remembering the days before motherhood consumed her soul, and years ago, when dreams were as vast and open as the sky itself. 

Her class today:  Intro to Public Speaking, the one room where students would be forced to confront their own inner voices and find courage in the face of an audience. It was a cruel irony â€“ Evelyn's voice had lost its vibrancy, her words trapped within the suffocating walls of motherhood. She adjusted her spectacles and took a deep breath, hoping for some spark of inspiration, but all she felt was the weight of silence.
