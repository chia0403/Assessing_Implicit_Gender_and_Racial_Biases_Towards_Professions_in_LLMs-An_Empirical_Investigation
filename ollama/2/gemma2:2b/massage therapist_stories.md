The salt-kissed air whipped around Amelia "Amy" Thorne's hair as she surveyed the bustling beach town of Seahaven. The sun was setting in a blaze of fiery orange and crimson, its light casting long, dramatic shadows on the sand as it dipped below the horizon. A gentle wave crashed against the shore, scattering bits of seaweed like confetti across the golden sand. Amy took a deep breath, filling her lungs with the salty scent of the ocean before turning to face the quaint, brightly-painted cottages lining Seahaven's main street. 

She’d been running "Serenity Spa" for five years now, ever since she escaped the stifling confines of her former life in Manhattan. The spa was nestled within a rambling Victorian home, its white picket fence a testament to her small-town charm, and yet it still held a certain urban sophistication.  It was here that Amy’s clients sought solace from their busy lives, a haven where they could be transported into a state of pure relaxation through the gentle strokes of her hands. 

The door chimed softly as a nervous young man in his late twenties shuffled inside, seeking a massage before a crucial presentation at work. His eyes were red-rimmed and he hunched over, shoulders tense and back slumped. Amy's heart went out to him.  His world was about to collapse in on itself, and she was there to help him rebuild, one smooth kneading motion at a time.
