The faint hum of fluorescent lights flickered above Theodore "Teddy" Finch as he swept across the linoleum floor of the Grand Central Library. It was past midnight, the last whispers of afternoon's bustle replaced by an unsettling quiet that seemed to hold its breath, waiting for something to stir in the grand silence. Teddy felt it too â€“ a prickling at the edges of his consciousness, an unyielding sense of expectancy. He glanced up at the clock: 12:37 AM.  

The library, usually a haven of hushed whispers and rustling pages, was cloaked in a strange stillness tonight. The towering stacks of books held their usual silence, their wooden shelves untouched by even a single hand-drawn bookmark. But something was different. A palpable tension, laced with an unsettlingly familiar aroma of damp earth and decay, pulsed through the air. Teddy's heart beat faster as he continued his routine, the familiar dance of dustpan and broom no longer comforting but almost menacing in its predictability. Something was amiss.
