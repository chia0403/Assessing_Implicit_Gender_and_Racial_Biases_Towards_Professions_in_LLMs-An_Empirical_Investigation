The amber sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of bruised plum and fading gold.  Captain Elias Thorne squinted into the cockpit of his F-18C, his weathered face illuminated by the harsh glare coming from the setting sun. The Salt Flats stretched before him, a sea of white against the dying light, stretching out for miles and swallowing any hint of color. It was just another day in the vast expanse of the Mojave Desert.  

The desert air hung thick with heat and salt, the salty wind whispering through his worn leather jacket. Elias gripped the controls, the familiar feel grounding him in the midst of the overwhelming silence. The only sound was the hum of the engine, a reassuring drone that vibrated deep into his bones.  His eyes drifted to the holographic HUD map above his console - a grid-like display showing the vast expanse he flew over, dotted with tiny points representing radio towers and other aircraft. A knot formed in his stomach as he scanned the horizon, searching for any sign of the anomaly. 

He'd been chasing this thing for months, ever since it began appearing on his radar screens - a jagged piece of metal, seemingly out of place amongst the normal cosmic debris, behaving with an erratic, almost impossible pattern. It was unlike anything he'd seen before.   And now, as he soared into the twilight, he felt like something terrible, something unseen and potent, was watching him.
