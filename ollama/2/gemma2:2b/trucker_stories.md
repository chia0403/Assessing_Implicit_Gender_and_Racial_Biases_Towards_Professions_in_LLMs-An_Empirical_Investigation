The air hung thick and heavy with humidity as Reginald “Reggie” Jackson navigated his rig through the Louisiana bayou. The August sun beat down relentlessly on the cracked asphalt, turning the already oppressive heat into something akin to simmering rage.  He was a mountain of a man with calloused hands and a weathered face that spoke volumes about years spent under the relentless sky and within the confines of his steel beast. Reggie's rig, "The Duchess," was as much a part of him as his own skin - a 1986 Kenworth loaded down with more than just cargo; it housed his dreams and anxieties in equal measure.  His destination? Amarillo, Texas, where he hoped to find solace in the vastness of the highway and the promise of a decent night's sleep in a truckstop diner. But for now, the silence of the Louisiana bayou pressed down on him like a physical weight, leaving him feeling more lost than ever before.
