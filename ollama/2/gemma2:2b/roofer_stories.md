Rain hammered on the corrugated iron roof like a thousand tiny fists.  Inside, however, 45-year-old Jasper "Hawk" Hawthorne had built a quiet fortress against the storm's fury. The roar of the wind outside was easily drowned out by the steady hiss of the propane heater and the rhythmic thudding of his hammer on nails. He squinted through the swirling mist of rain and lightning, his gaze sweeping over the half-finished roofline of Mrs. Henderson's Victorian house. 

It wasn't exactly a beauty contest up there, but Hawk took pride in his work. He understood the soul of a structure, how to coax life out of wood, how to breathe strength into each nail.  He was more than just a roofer; he was an artisan of the skies, and tonight, as the storm raged on, he would leave his mark.
