The rusty clang of the old streetlamp echoed through Amelia Alcott's studio as she adjusted her paint-splattered apron. It wasn't midnight, not exactly, but the sky outside was bleeding into a bruised twilight that felt like the canvas in front of her. Moonlight sliced between gaps in the heavy oak doorframe, illuminating swirling streaks of cobalt and jade against the muted grey of the room. 

Amelia dipped her brush in the cerulean sky-blue she'd named 'Nocturne'. It wasn't meant to be a literal reflection of the night sky; instead, it was an expression of the storm brewing within her. The paint felt thick on her fingertips, mirroring the knot that tightened in her stomach with every stroke.

Her studio was tucked away on the edge of Newhaven, a forgotten corner where old brick houses huddled close to cobbled streets and time seemed to stand still. There was something melancholic about the place, but for Amelia, it also held a sense of solitude â€“ a sanctuary for her soul, where she could drown herself in color and let her emotions flow onto the canvas. Tonight, though, she wasn't sure what she was trying to express. The turmoil within her, bottled up like the last drop of paint in her palette, demanded an outlet.
