Rain slicked the windows of "The Glittering Gem" like a million fallen tears, blurring the neon glow of the city outside into an abstract swirl of colors. Inside, Amelia "Millie" Sterling stood poised at the counter, her usual sunny smile masked by an increasingly weary frown. It was 10 PM, and not one customer had dared to enter the store since Millie’s shift started. Not even for that little “end-of-day sparkle” deal – a discount on jewelry as the clock neared midnight – which usually brought in a steady stream of desperate shoppers.  

This evening felt different, though. Something hummed beneath the low murmur of city traffic and the distant rumble of thunder. Millie’s eyes drifted toward the large showcase behind her, where sparkling diamonds gleamed under the dim lights like captured stars. This wasn't a normal night for sales, but something felt… off-kilter.  

It was just Millie's intuition talking, she told herself, fueled by years spent navigating the delicate dance of high-end salesmanship. But as she watched the rain batter against the glass display – each drop leaving an ephemeral trail like tears on a windowpane – she couldn’t shake off the feeling that something strange was about to happen. Something… precious.
