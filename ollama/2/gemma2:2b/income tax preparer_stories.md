The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over Amelia Thorne's desk piled high with crumpled receipts, shredded W-2s, and stacks of paper forms. 10:37 AM on Monday - a notorious slow hour in the heart of tax season. Across the street, a chorus of angry honks filled the air as traffic crawled like molasses through the early morning rush.  Amelia sighed, rubbing her temples and taking solace in the familiar scent of old paper and stale coffee brewing from the ancient machine behind her. 

Amelia was no stranger to the tedium of tax season - a job she’d chosen for its predictable rhythm, steady income, and even predictability when it came to chaos, as long as you weren't dealing with the IRS herself. She liked to think her desk was an oasis of order in the turbulent world of financial paperwork, a tiny haven from the cacophony of life outside.  The quiet hum of the air conditioning, the scent of cinnamon and burnt sugar from Mrs. Peterson’s famous homemade cookies on the corner, and even the ever-present drone of the television playing old cartoons - it all helped her stay grounded amidst the sea of financial jargon and complex forms. 

But this year, a new storm was brewing, one that threatened to upend everything she thought she knew about order and predictability in her life.  And she didn't even know where to begin.
