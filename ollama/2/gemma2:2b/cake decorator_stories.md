## The Buttercream Waltz

**Setting:**  A bustling city like New Orleans in the summer. Outside, cicadas hummed their incessant song while street vendors hawked po-boys on every corner. Inside "Sweet Surrender," a quaint little shop with pastel walls and floral wallpaper, the air was thick with the scent of vanilla and cinnamon. The rhythmic clatter of baking trays mingled with the gentle whir of the mixer. 

**Character:**  **Cassia LeBlanc**, whose nickname was "Cas" by everyone who knew her, had the kindest smile you’d ever see, but a glint in her eye that spoke of hidden fire. Her hands danced across cake batter like an artist sculpting marble, creating floral patterns on top of delicate vanilla and almond creations. She wasn't just a baker; she was a magician, conjuring sweetness from flour and sugar.

**Opening:**  Cassia wiped a sheen of sweat off her forehead, the air still sticky from the morning rush. "Another wedding tomorrow," she sighed, looking at the mountain of buttercream frosting on the counter. "This time I'm aiming for something… elegant. A little bit of a waltz." Her words echoed in the small kitchen as she surveyed the towering pile of frosting, ready to bring her artistic vision to life.  But as Cassia started working, a strange feeling washed over her. The buttercream seemed less like frosting and more like an unyielding force, pushing back against her every attempt at control. This wedding was different; this wasn't just a celebration of love, but also something… unsettlingly complex.
