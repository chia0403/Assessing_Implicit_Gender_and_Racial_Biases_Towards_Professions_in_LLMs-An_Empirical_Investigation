##  Setting: Coastal Maine

The salty air whipped at Amelia "Amy" Bennett's auburn hair as she stood on the weathered wooden dock. A misty sun peeked through the clouds, casting long, wavering shadows across the crashing waves of Casco Bay. The scent of brine and freshly baked bread filled her nostrils, a comforting combination that was oddly bittersweet tonight. 

The quaint seaside town of Oakhaven had always held a special charm for Amy. She'd grown up here, helping her grandmother in her bakery, learning to love the earthy bounty of local farms and the rhythm of the seasons. But now, with the weight of her new practice on her shoulders, she felt strangely out of place.  

**Amy, a renowned dietician specializing in healthy living, had finally opened her own clinic in Oakhaven.**  The quaint, cozy space was filled with natural sunlight streaming through the windows and the soft hum of the old refrigerator humming along to the steady rhythm of life.  She'd dreamt of this moment since she graduated from college, a world away from the bustling city kitchens she'd once called home. 

Tonight, though, even the smell of her grandmother's signature blueberry muffins couldn’t quite drown out the nagging fear that she was on the verge of losing sight of what truly mattered – not just the meticulous details of nutrition plans, but the connection to this place and its people.
