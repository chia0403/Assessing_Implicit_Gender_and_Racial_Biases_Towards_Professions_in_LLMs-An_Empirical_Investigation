The greasy spoon cafe was practically vibrating with morning gossip as Reginald "Reg" Plunkett wrestled his breakfast burrito into submission. His knuckles were white against the paper-thin foil, each bite an exercise in controlled chaos. He'd been on call for the last 24 hours, a reality that wasn't exactly conducive to breakfast habits or even coherent conversation with his grumpy landlady, Mrs. Peabody.  

The year was 1985 and the grimy streets of San Francisco were still finding their footing amidst the tech boom. The city's skyline was a patchwork of old brick buildings and newly-built condos, promising both comfort and an alarming lack of public sanitation. Reg was born here, raised in this chaos, his life as familiar and predictable as the rusty pipes he dealt with every day. 

He glanced at the greasy spoon across the street - The Floozy Fiasco, a haven for sailors looking to forget their rough lives over a shot of rye and a plate of dry toast. He'd seen enough trouble on his rounds to fill several lifetimes.  But today, there was something different about the way the air hung thick with anxiety, like a storm brewing in the distance.
