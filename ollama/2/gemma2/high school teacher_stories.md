The late afternoon sun cast long shadows across Miss Amelia Thistlewick's classroom, highlighting the dust motes dancing in the air like miniature galaxies. Outside, the usual hum of suburban life – lawnmowers, barking dogs, children shrieking with laughter – was muted by the thick double-paned windows. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of stale chalk and forgotten dreams. 

Amelia straightened her cardigan, smoothing down the faint wrinkles that seemed to appear whenever she felt a pang of disappointment in her students. Today’s lesson on Shakespeare's "Hamlet" had been met with the usual glazed-over stares and stifled yawns.  It was as if they were all trapped in a play of their own, one where Shakespeare was the villain and boredom was the tragic hero. 

She sighed, peering at the clock ticking ominously towards dismissal. Only twenty minutes left before she could escape this melancholic theater and retreat to the sanctuary of her quiet apartment. She longed for the comforting silence of her bookshelves and the gentle hum of her vintage record player.


Amelia Thistlewick had dedicated her life to nurturing young minds, but sometimes, it felt like the seeds she planted were falling on barren ground.
