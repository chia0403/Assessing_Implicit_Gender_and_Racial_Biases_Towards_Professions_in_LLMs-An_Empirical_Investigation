The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the reception area of "Dr. Anya's Holistic Healing Center."  Dust motes danced in the pale light filtering through the sheer curtains that veiled the windows. The scent of lavender and sandalwood hung heavy in the air, battling with the faint aroma of burnt coffee emanating from the neglected pot on the counter. 

Eleanor Beatrice Cartwright, better known as Ellie to her regulars (and everyone else who knew her well), sighed as she tapped away at the ancient computer system. It was always slow, even when no one was using it.  Ellie hated that it lacked a decent internet connection - clients often complained about not being able to browse while waiting. 

Today, however, Ellie wasn't preoccupied with the antiquated technology or the lack of fresh flowers in the vase on the counter. A strange energy hummed beneath her skin, a tingling anticipation that made her heart beat faster than usual.  She couldn’t explain it, but she knew something different was going to happen today at Dr. Anya’s Holistic Healing Center.
