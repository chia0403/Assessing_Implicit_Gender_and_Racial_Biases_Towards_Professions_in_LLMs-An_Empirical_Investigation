The scent of vanilla and lemon hung thick in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of freshly cut hair. Sunlight streamed through the large window at the back of "Shear Delight," illuminating dust motes dancing in its warm glow.  

Seraphina Bellweather hummed along to the jazz music on the radio as she expertly snipped a client's fringe, her silver shears glinting like miniature daggers. The salon was quiet this Tuesday afternoon, just Seraphina and a few scattered patrons. 

She glanced at the clock - nearly four o'clock. Just enough time for one more client before closing up shop. A sudden gust of wind rattled the windowpanes, bringing with it a flurry of autumn leaves swirling down the street. Seraphina smiled â€“ fall was her favourite season. It brought a change of pace, a sense of quiet anticipation. 

Then, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a new arrival.  Seraphina turned, expecting another familiar face, but instead found herself staring into the eyes of a stranger. He stood in the doorway, framed by the fading sunlight, his features obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and an air of mystery that sent a shiver down her spine.
