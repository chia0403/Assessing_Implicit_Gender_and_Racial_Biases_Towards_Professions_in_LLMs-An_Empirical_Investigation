Rain hammered against Detective Isabella "Izzy" Santos's trench coat, each drop exploding in a miniature firework against the slick asphalt. The neon signs of the Chinatown district shimmered through the downpour, casting long, distorted reflections onto the overflowing gutters. Izzy hunched deeper into her collar, trying to ignore the chill that seeped through even her thick layers. 

The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and frying noodles, a familiar aroma on this rain-soaked street corner. But tonight, it was tainted by something else: the metallic tang of blood, sharp and acrid like burnt coffee.  It clung to Izzy's nostrils as she knelt beside the body, her face illuminated by the harsh glare of the patrol carâ€™s spotlight. 


A young woman lay sprawled on the sidewalk, her vibrant crimson dress a stark contrast to the pale canvas of death that surrounded her. A pool of blood blossomed around her head, a grotesque counterpoint to the delicate cherry blossom tattoo that adorned her wrist.  Izzy gently pushed aside a stray strand of hair, revealing a small jade pendant clutched in the woman's hand. 

This wasn't just another Chinatown homicide. This was personal.
