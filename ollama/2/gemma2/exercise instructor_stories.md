The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow across the mirrored walls of the Spin Zone studio.  Sweat beaded on Evelyn Beatrice Hawthorne's brow as she surveyed her class, a mismatched group of twenty bodies clad in neon spandex and determination.  Evelyn adjusted the headset microphone that amplified her voice to a stadium-worthy level, pushing back a stray strand of fiery red hair that always seemed to escape its ponytail. 

"Alright, warriors!" Evelyn boomed, her smile radiating through the mirrored maze. "Time to push your limits! Today, we're going for a personal best. We're tackling Hill Climb Inferno - are you ready?"  A chorus of cheers and groans met her challenge, punctuated by the click-clack of cycling shoes hitting pedals. Evelyn raised an eyebrow at the newcomer, a shy woman hunched over her bike with a look of pure apprehension. "Welcome to the chaos," Evelyn muttered, flashing her a reassuring grin. It was going to be a long ride.
