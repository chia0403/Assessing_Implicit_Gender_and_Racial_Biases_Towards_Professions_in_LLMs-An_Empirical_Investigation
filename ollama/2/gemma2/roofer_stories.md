The sun beat down on Bartholomew "Bart"  Harrington's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he expertly maneuvered across the sloping shingles, each step measured and precise. He was nearing the peak of Mrs. Periwinkle's Victorian mansion, its ornate turrets reaching towards the cloudless summer sky. The air thrummed with the rhythmic whir of cicadas and the distant rumble of a passing truck on Elm Street. 

Bart paused, wiping his brow with a grimy rag. Below him, the manicured lawns of Oakwood Estates sprawled like a green sea, each house a perfect picture of suburban bliss. But Bart didn't envy their inhabitants. He preferred the rough hands-on work, the freedom of the open sky, and the challenge of coaxing order from unruly materials. Besides, he had a secret â€“ beneath his calloused exterior and sun-bleached hair, Bart harbored a yearning for something more than just patching leaky roofs.
