The sun bled crimson across the dusty plains, casting long shadows from the skeletal remains of mesquite trees that lined Old Man Jebediah's fence line.  Jebediah, or Jeb as everyone called him, squinted at the horizon, his weathered face creased with worry. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling like mischievous spirits against the backdrop of a bruised sky. The air hung heavy with the smell of parched earth and impending rain. 

Jeb wiped the sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, his eyes fixed on the lone cowbell that tinkled faintly in the gathering dusk. It was Daisy's bell, his prize heifer, and she shouldn't be so far out this late.  A knot of unease tightened in his gut. Something wasn't right.
