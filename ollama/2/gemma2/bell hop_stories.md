The Grand Majestic Hotel was a relic from a bygone era, its grandeur now faded like an old tapestry, its once vibrant halls dimmed by years of neglect and the whispers of forgotten secrets. Arthur knew every creak of the floorboards, every rustle in the dusty drapes, every sigh of discontent echoing from the vacant rooms. He navigated these labyrinthine corridors with the practiced grace of a seasoned veteran, carrying luggage as if it were featherlight, his smile fixed and polite despite the gnawing emptiness that seemed to cling to him like cobwebs.

He felt a prickle of anticipation, a sense that this night would be anything but ordinary.  A guest had arrived, their name whispered in hushed tones among the staff - someone shrouded in mystery, someone who promised to disrupt the stagnant routine of The Grand Majestic, and perhaps, Arthurâ€™s own life.
