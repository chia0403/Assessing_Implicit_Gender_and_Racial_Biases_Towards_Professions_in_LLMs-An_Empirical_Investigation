The grease stained her overalls like abstract art - swirls of engine oil and grime against faded denim. A plume of exhaust smoke snaked from under the hood of the rusted Ford pickup she was wrestling with, stinging Clara Beatrice Montgomery's eyes.  Clara, better known as "Monty" by everyone who knew her, scowled at the stubborn fuel injector. This beast of a truck had been sitting in her tiny garage for a month, its owner, Old Man Hemmings, growing increasingly impatient. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across Monty's workshop, turning the clutter of tools and spare parts into menacing shapes. The air was thick with the smell of gasoline, burnt oil, and something faintly sweet, probably from the cherry pie cooling on her workbench. Outside, the familiar sounds of Maple Creek were fading into the twilight: a distant train whistle, the rhythmic click-clack of Mrs. Peterson's knitting needles, and the occasional bark from Mr. Henderson's rambunctious Beagle.  

Monty sighed, wiped her brow with a grease-stained rag, and muttered, "Just one more bolt, you old piece of junk. Then we can have some pie."
