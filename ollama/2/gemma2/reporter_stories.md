The air hung thick with the stench of saltwater and desperation.  Amelia "Amy" Brighton, a young reporter with eyes that mirrored the stormy Atlantic she called home, squinted at the rickety fishing boat bobbing precariously in the harbor. A single mast leaned at an unnatural angle, as if it had been broken by some unseen force. The captain, his weathered face etched with worry lines deeper than any map of the coast, paced the narrow deck, muttering curses under his breath. 

Amy adjusted the strap of her camera bag and approached cautiously.  The harbor was normally a symphony of boisterous chatter and clanging nets, but today it held an unsettling silence, punctuated only by the mournful cries of gulls circling overhead. The fishermen huddled on the docks, their faces grim as they watched the boat with morbid fascination.

"Captain?" Amy called out, her voice barely audible above the wind whipping through the rigging.  "Can I talk to you? I'm Amy Brighton from the Coastal Gazette."


The setting is a small, weathered coastal town named Saltwind, Massachusetts, known for its hardy fishing community and its turbulent weather patterns.
