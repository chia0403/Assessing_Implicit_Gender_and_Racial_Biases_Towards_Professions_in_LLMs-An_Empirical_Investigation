The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thompson's head, casting a sterile, pale glow over the rows of gleaming chrome instruments laid out before her. The familiar scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, tinged with a faint whiff of peppermint from the toothpaste she'd recently used on Mr. Henderson's teeth. It was 8:50 am, and Amelia was already five minutes behind schedule.  

The waiting room, usually bustling with anxious patients clutching pamphlets about gum disease prevention, was unnervingly quiet. A single newspaper lay forgotten on a plastic chair, its headline screaming about an impending storm that promised to hit their coastal town hard. 

Amelia sighed, adjusting the blue scrubs that felt more like a uniform than clothing these days.  The clinic, nestled in a sleepy seaside village called Oakhaven, was her anchor, her only connection to normalcy after... well, after everything. Today, however, even Oakhaven seemed to be holding its breath, waiting for the storm to break.
