The scent of rain-soaked earth and old paper mingled in Amelia Rose Blackwood's tiny study. Rain lashed against the attic windowpanes, blurring the view of the sprawling, ivy-choked garden below. A gust rattled the loose pane, sending shivers down Amelia’s spine. She shivered, not from the cold, but from a creeping unease that always accompanied her writing process. It was like stepping into a labyrinth, never knowing which path led to brilliance and which spiraled into oblivion.  

Amelia pushed aside the tangled mess of half-written drafts, each vying for attention like hungry wolves. Her fingers hovered over the worn keys of her antique typewriter, a relic from her grandfather, the renowned mystery novelist who'd left her with both his name and his passion. She took a deep breath, attempting to tame the tempest brewing within her own mind.

Today was different. Today, she had to find the words for "The Raven’s Shadow," her most ambitious novel yet – a gothic thriller steeped in secrets and whispers of an ancient curse.  But as Amelia stared at the blank page, the words seemed lost in the storm raging outside.
