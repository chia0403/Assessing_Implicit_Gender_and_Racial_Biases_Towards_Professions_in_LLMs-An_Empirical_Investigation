The air hung thick with the scent of lilac shampoo and impending rain.  Sunlight slanted through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the humid salon air. Outside, the bustling streets of New Orleans hummed with a Saturday morning energy, but inside "Hairitage," things moved at a slower pace. Amelia Beatrice Dupont, renowned for her transformative colour work and ability to conjure up vintage hairstyles from forgotten dreams, sat meticulously applying highlights to a blonde client named Tiffany.  

Amelia loved this time of day – the quiet before the afternoon rush when the only sounds were the hum of hairdryers and the gentle murmur of conversation. She took pride in creating havens within her salon walls, places where worries faded away with each snip of the shears and every strand of colour expertly placed. But today, a prickle of unease danced beneath Amelia's usual calm.  A phone call earlier that morning from her estranged father had left a lingering sense of foreboding, a feeling amplified by the incessant rain hammering against the windowpanes. 


He hadn’t called in years.
