The air hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and cheap perfume as Amelia "Amy" Rose adjusted her headset microphone.

He was staring straight ahead, eyes fixed on the aisle, but something about his stillness, the way he held himself rigidly in his seat, set off alarm bells in Amy's gut.  This flight, normally just another stop on her route, suddenly felt charged with an unfamiliar tension.
