The humid New Orleans air clung to Evangeline Bellefleur like a second skin as she walked down Bourbon Street. Neon signs buzzed with promises of cheap drinks and fleeting connections, casting lurid shadows across the throngs of tourists weaving between street performers and hawkers selling everything from voodoo dolls to plastic beads. Evangeline adjusted the strap of her guitar case, the worn leather cool against her clammy palm. Her heart hammered a frantic rhythm against her ribs, a counterpoint to the pulsating bassline spilling out from the open doorways of nearby bars.  

Tonight was different. This wasn't just another gig at some dive bar trying to eke out a living. Tonight, she had a chance. A real chance. The legendary jazz club, Preservation Hall, had invited her to play an open audition. Just a single song, but if it impressed the right people, it could be her ticket to something bigger, something more. 


Evangeline swallowed, tasting the metallic tang of fear on her tongue. It was now or never. She took a deep breath, letting the scent of beignets and stale beer fill her lungs, then pushed open the heavy oak door of Preservation Hall. The familiar warmth of the dimly lit room washed over her, filled with the murmurs of patrons sipping cocktails and the rhythmic thump of a bass drum.  Tonight, everything depended on the song she carried inside.
