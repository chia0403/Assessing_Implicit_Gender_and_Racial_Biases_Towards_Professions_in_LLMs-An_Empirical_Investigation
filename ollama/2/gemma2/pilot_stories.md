The air crackled with static as Amelia "Ace" Vance wrestled the rusty controls of her X-14 Sparrowhawk fighter.  Her knuckles whitened on the worn leather yoke, muscles screaming in protest as she banked hard left, narrowly avoiding a hail of debris spewing from the crumbling moonbase’s ventilation shafts. 

Below, the once pristine lunar landscape was now scarred and pockmarked, a canvas of fractured metal and dust churned by weeks of relentless bombardment.  The sky, normally a flawless black studded with diamond-bright stars, was obscured by an oppressive haze of smoke and ash. The orbital bombardment had begun just hours ago, and even from the Sparrowhawk’s cramped cockpit, Ace could feel the tremor in her teeth, the primal fear that resonated through every bone. 

Ace squinted at the flickering holographic display, desperately seeking any sign of life amidst the chaos.  Her mission: locate and extract a handful of surviving engineers, their expertise crucial to patching up the ravaged communications array and sending a distress signal to Earth. But with every passing moment, hope seemed to dwindle like the oxygen in her suit’s tank. 


This was not how it was supposed to go. Not for Ace Vance, the youngest pilot ever to earn her stripes on the lunar frontier, a woman who had faced down asteroid storms and space pirates with unwavering courage.  But here she was, trapped on a dying moonbase, fighting for survival in the midst of a war that threatened to consume them all.
