The air hung thick with the scent of granite and sweat in Elias Thorne’s workshop.  Sunlight, fractured by the grime-coated windowpanes, illuminated dust motes dancing in the stale air. Outside, the bustling city of Aethelgard roared with life, but here, within the rough hewn walls of his sanctuary, time moved differently.  Elias ran a calloused thumb over the cool surface of a half-finished sculpture, its marble form slowly emerging from the chaotic mass of stone. This wasn't just any piece – it was a commission for Lord Evermore himself, a depiction of the legendary phoenix, meant to adorn the grand hall of his manor. The weight of expectation pressed heavily on Elias’s shoulders, a burden he bore with stoic silence and unwavering focus.  Each strike of his hammer echoed through the workshop, a rhythmic beat against the relentless pressure of his ambition. 


Elias Thorne was not just any stone cutter. He was Aethelgard's most celebrated craftsman, renowned for his ability to capture the essence of life within lifeless rock. But with each passing year, the weight of his fame grew heavier, threatening to crush the fire that fueled his passion. This phoenix commission could be his masterpiece, his ticket to true immortality, or it could be his downfall.
