The air hung thick with the scent of sizzling garlic and overcooked shrimp. A low hum of conversation buzzed around Amelia Josephine "Amy" Reyes as she weaved through tables laden with half-empty wine glasses and plates licked clean. The "Sunset Cove Bistro," a place more known for its breathtaking ocean views than its culinary excellence, was buzzing on this Saturday night. Amy, her uniform crisp despite the sweat prickling under her collar, surveyed the scene with practiced ease. She knew every nook and cranny of this cramped space, the quirks of each table, the regulars' preferred seats, and the ever-shifting moods of the patrons. 

Tonight, however, felt different. A nervous energy thrummed beneath the usual clamor.  A pair of tourists argued over a wilted salad, a couple whispered heatedly in a corner booth, and Amy herself caught a glimpse of a man with eyes like storm clouds lurking near the bar, his gaze darting around the room with unnerving intensity. 


Amy adjusted the strap of her apron, her stomach churning with a premonition she couldn't shake.  Something was about to happen here at Sunset Cove Bistro, and it wasnâ€™t going to be good.
