The stale scent of lavender oil hung thick in the air, a thin veil over the familiar musty aroma of old wood and liniment. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of Dr. Amelia Thorne’s office, illuminating motes of dust dancing like tiny ballerinas in the golden light. Outside, the bustling heart of downtown Asheville thrummed with life – tourists clamoring for artisanal donuts, buskers serenading passersby, dogs on leashes sniffing at overflowing trash cans. But inside Dr. Thorne's sanctuary, time seemed to move differently. 

Amelia, with her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid and spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, surveyed the waiting room. A young woman, nervously chewing on her thumbnail, sat hunched over a dog-eared magazine. A burly construction worker grunted as he shifted uncomfortably in his chair, his neck cradled gingerly between his hands. 

Amelia sighed, smoothing down the wrinkles on her crisp white scrubs. Another day in paradise. She loved helping people find relief from their aches and pains, but sometimes, the constant flow of suffering felt like a relentless tide. But then, she’d see the flicker of gratitude in someone's eyes after a good adjustment, hear their stiff limbs creak back into life, and it would all be worth it.
