Outside, the city of New Haven pulsed with life, oblivious to the epic battle Amelia waged against lines of code in her tiny apartment on the third floor. The world felt distant, relegated to a blurry backdrop as she delved deeper into the intricate labyrinth of algorithms that held both the promise of breakthrough and the threat of total failure.
