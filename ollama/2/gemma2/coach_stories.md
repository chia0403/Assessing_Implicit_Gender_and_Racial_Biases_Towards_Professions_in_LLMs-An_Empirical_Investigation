The August sun beat down relentlessly, turning the grass into a shimmering green mirage. Her whistle felt slick and cold in her hand, its metallic sheen reflecting the light like a beacon in this sweltering afternoon. Evie adjusted her signature straw hat, pushing back a strand of auburn hair that had escaped her tight braid, and took a deep breath.

Or would they succumb to the pressure, the skepticism, and ultimately, her own self-doubt?
