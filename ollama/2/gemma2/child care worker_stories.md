The scent of hand sanitizer hung thick in the air, mingling with the faint sweetness of spilled juice boxes and the musty aroma of worn plush toys. Amelia "Amy" Rose peered over a pile of building blocks, her brow furrowed as she watched four-year-old Liam desperately try to construct a tower taller than himself. His face was scrunched in concentration, his tongue poking out from the corner of his mouth like a determined lizard. 

The setting sun cast long shadows across the brightly coloured walls of Sunshine Daycare, bathing the room in an orange glow. Outside, the first leaves of autumn were beginning to turn, fluttering lazily down onto the playground below. Amy sighed contentedly. This was her haven, a world where scraped knees were treated with kisses and tears were always met with a hug.  

But even in this peaceful sanctuary, trouble sometimes found its way in. And today, it arrived in the form of a phone call from Liam's mother, her voice tight with worry. "Amy," she said, "Liam's been acting strangely all day. He keeps talking about a shadow man and...and monsters under his bed."
