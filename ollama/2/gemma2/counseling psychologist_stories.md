The air in Dr. Amelia Beatrice Hayes' office felt thick with unspoken words, like a summer day heavy with humidity. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in its golden rays. Outside, the world buzzed with the frenetic energy of a Monday morning: car horns honking, construction clanging, laughter spilling from cafes. But within these four walls, an unsettling silence reigned. 

Amelia sat poised on the edge of her velvet-upholstered chair, her gaze fixed on the woman across from her.  Eleanor Vance, a petite woman with eyes that seemed to hold the weight of the world, sat slumped in the opposite chair, fidgeting with the frayed edges of her purse strap. Her voice, when it finally emerged, was barely a whisper.


"I justâ€¦ I don't know what to do anymore, Dr. Hayes," Eleanor confessed, her gaze drifting towards the patterned rug beneath her feet. "It's like everything is falling apart."
