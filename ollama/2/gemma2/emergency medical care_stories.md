The flickering blue and red lights painted the deserted alley in stark, pulsating hues. Rain lashed against Amelia Grace Blackwood’s paramedic jacket, each drop exploding on the pavement like tiny bursts of static.  The stench of stale beer and urine hung heavy in the air, mingling with the metallic tang of blood. 

Amelia crouched beside the victim, his chest barely rising and falling beneath a stained t-shirt. His eyes were glazed over, unfocused, staring blindly into the darkness. She checked his pulse – weak, fading fast.  "Sir? Can you hear me?" Her voice was calm, practiced, despite the prickle of fear crawling down her spine. 

The city, usually a symphony of noise and motion, held its breath in this forgotten corner. Amelia felt it around her: the oppressive silence punctuated only by the insistent patter of rain and the distant wail of a siren that seemed to mock their isolation. The weight of responsibility pressed down on her shoulders, heavier than the bulky medical kit strapped to her back. 

This was more than just another call. This was a life hanging in the balance, tethered precariously to Amelia's skill and quick thinking. And tonight, she prayed that would be enough.
