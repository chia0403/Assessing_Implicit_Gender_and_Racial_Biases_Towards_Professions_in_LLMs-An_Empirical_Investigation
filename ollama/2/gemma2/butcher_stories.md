The coppery tang of blood clung to everything in Bartholomew "Bart" Hemlock's life.  It was the scent of his father's workbench, the lingering aroma on his own calloused hands, even the worn leather of his apron seemed infused with it. He worked at Hemlock & Sons Butcher Shop, a fixture on Maple Street since before the turn of the century, its window display perpetually adorned with glistening hams and ruby-red roasts. 

Bart knew the cuts like the back of his hand: the lean flank for stir-fries, the marbled ribeye perfect for grilling, even the less popular offal, which he'd learned to appreciate in its own way. He respected the animals, acknowledging their sacrifice with a swiftness that bordered on reverence. But lately, a creeping unease had begun to gnaw at him, a feeling that the rhythm of his life, predictable and comforting as it was, was about to be shattered. It started with whispers among the townsfolk: murmurs of strange events in the woods bordering their small town of Oakhaven, whispers of shadowy figures and unnerving silence where birdsong once reigned. 


Bart dismissed them at first, the ramblings of superstitious folk who found comfort in fantastical explanations.  But then came the missing sheep, followed by a stray cat with vacant eyes and bleeding wounds that defied explanation. The unease morphed into something heavier, a prickling sensation on his skin as if he was being watched, judged. He wasn't sure what was coming for Oakhaven, but Bart Hemlock, the butcher who dealt in life and death, knew he wouldnâ€™t stand idly by.
