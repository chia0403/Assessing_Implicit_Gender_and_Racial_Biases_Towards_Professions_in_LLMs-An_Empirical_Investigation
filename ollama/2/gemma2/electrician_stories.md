The humid Georgia air clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Hayes like a second skin as he squeezed through the narrow doorway of the ramshackle cabin.  Sunlight filtered through grimy windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stagnant air. The scent of mildew and damp wood hung heavy, a testament to years of neglect. Bart, his calloused hands gripping a toolbox nearly the size of himself, surveyed the scene with practiced indifference. 

This wasn't his first rodeo.  He'd seen it all â€“ wiring nightmares cobbled together by desperate amateurs, rusted conduits choked with rodent nests, flickering lights powered by frayed extensions cords precariously taped to walls. But this cabin, nestled deep in the woods on the edge of a forgotten town, had an air of particular decay that made the hairs on his neck stand on end. It was as if the very structure was holding its breath, waiting for something to break.

Bart cleared his throat, his voice echoing hollowly in the stillness. "Hello?  Anyone here?"


The only answer was the rustle of wind through the overgrown weeds outside and the distant cawing of a crow.
