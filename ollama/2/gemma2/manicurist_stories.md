The scent of jasmine and acetone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Esmeralda "Esme" Flores as she meticulously filed the edges of Mrs. Vanderly's chipped French manicure. Sunlight streamed through the large window at La Bella Luna, casting shimmering rainbows on Esme's neatly organized station. Her salon, nestled on a quiet side street in the heart of New Orleans' historic French Quarter, was her sanctuary – a world of lavender scrubs, sparkling nail polishes, and whispered secrets.

Outside, the city hummed with its usual cacophony: jazz melodies spilling from open doors, vendors hawking their wares, and the murmur of tourists exploring the cobblestone streets. But inside La Bella Luna, time seemed to slow, each meticulous stroke of Esme's file a measured beat in the symphony of serenity she created for her clients.  


Esme paused, catching Mrs. Vanderly's gaze in the mirror. "There's something bothering you," she said gently, setting down the file. Mrs. Vanderly, normally a chatterbox about the latest social gossip, had been unusually quiet. Her normally vibrant blue eyes seemed dulled with worry.

Mrs. Vanderly hesitated, then sighed, her voice barely a whisper. "My niece, Amelia… She's acting strange."
