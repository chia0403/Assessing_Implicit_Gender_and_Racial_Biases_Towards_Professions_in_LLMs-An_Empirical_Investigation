The neon sign outside flickered erratically, casting long, wavering stripes across the rain-slicked asphalt. The "Open" sign inside, stubbornly incandescent, felt like a beacon in the swirling grey of the storm. Rain lashed against the dusty windows of The Last Call, blurring the cityscape into an impressionistic nightmare.  

Inside, Alistair Finchley wiped down a glass with practiced ease, his movements rhythmic and precise despite the drumming rain outside. He was a man carved from shadows and whiskey - lean, angular, with eyes that held the wisdom of too many late nights and forgotten stories. A faint scent of cloves and burnt sugar clung to him, a subtle reminder of the spiced rum he'd been nursing earlier. 

Alistair glanced at the clock above the bar: 10:47 PM. Another night stretching before him, another symphony of broken hearts and empty promises ready to be served. Tonight, though, something felt different. A prickle of anticipation danced on his skin, a feeling he hadn't experienced in years. This wasn't just another Friday night at The Last Call. Something was coming.
