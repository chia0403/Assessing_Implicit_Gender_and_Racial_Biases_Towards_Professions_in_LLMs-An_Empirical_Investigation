The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of "Leaky's Repairs", a symphony of metallic percussion that usually soothed Arthur Bartholomew 'Leaky' Leakey's soul.  Today, however, it was an unwelcome drumbeat driving away any semblance of peace. He sat hunched over his workbench, fiddling with a busted pipe wrench and scowling at the storm brewing outside. His workshop, a converted shed behind his grandmother's rambling Victorian house in the sleepy seaside town of Grimsby-on-Sea, was cramped, cluttered, and smelled vaguely of rust and damp wool â€“ but it was home.  

Leaky preferred the quiet solitude of his workshop to the clamorous pubs that crowded the main street, where gossips and fishermen traded tales over pints of lukewarm ale. He was content with his modest life, fixing leaky faucets, unclogging drains, and occasionally rescuing cats stuck in chimneys. 


But lately, a restlessness had been gnawing at him, a yearning for something more than plumbing pipes and patching broken cisterns.  What that "something more" was, however, remained a mystery shrouded in the mists of Grimsby-on-Sea's perpetually gray sky.
