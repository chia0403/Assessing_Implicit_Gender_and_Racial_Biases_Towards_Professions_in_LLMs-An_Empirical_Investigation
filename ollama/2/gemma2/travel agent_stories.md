The aroma of Earl Grey tea mingled with the scent of old paperbacks in Penelope Amelia Thistlewick's office. Sunlight slanted through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing in the air. Maps, framed postcards from exotic locales, and faded travel brochures plastered every available inch of wall space. 

Penelope, a woman whose wrinkles told tales of countless journeys and whose eyes sparkled with wanderlust, was staring intently at a weather report on her ancient computer screen.  It showed torrential rain forecast for Iceland, which put a dent in the meticulously crafted itinerary she'd designed for Mr. Bartholomew Billingsworth's upcoming honeymoon. 

Mr. Billingsworth, notorious for his aversion to anything remotely damp, was likely to be inconsolable. Penelope sighed, pushing her silver hair back from her face. This wasn't just about rearranging a few sightseeing stops; it was about preserving the magic of travel, ensuring that even unpredictable Icelandic weather couldn't dampen the spirit of adventure.
