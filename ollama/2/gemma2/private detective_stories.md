Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Jack "Hawkeye" Harrigan's office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street. Inside, the air hung thick with cigarette smoke and stale coffee, the only light emanating from a flickering desk lamp illuminating a half-empty bottle of bourbon and a worn photograph. The photo showed a young woman with fiery red hair and eyes that held a mischievous glint – Jack's late wife, Moira. He hadn't touched it in months, afraid to drown in the familiar ache of her absence.

A sharp rap on the door broke him from his reverie. A man stood silhouetted against the flickering streetlight outside, his face obscured by the shadows. 

"Harrigan?" His voice was gravelly, laced with desperation. "They say you're the best there is."


The year was 1947, and Jack "Hawkeye" Harrigan had carved a niche for himself in the underbelly of Chicago. He wasn't interested in solving petty thefts or chasing runaway wives. Hawkeye dealt in secrets – the kind that could shatter reputations, ignite wars, or send men to an early grave. And this man, whoever he was, seemed to have one that was about to explode.
