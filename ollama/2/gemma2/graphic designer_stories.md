The stale scent of printer ink hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elara June Hawthorne. Her fingers danced across the keyboard, pulling up her latest design: a whimsical font for a children's book about talking squirrels. She adjusted the kerning, squinting at the screen, then sighed. 

Elara was good, damn good. But she was also restless. Stuck in this cramped basement studio with its peeling paint and dusty Mac, Elara craved something more than designing logos for local bakeries and websites for dentists.  She dreamed of vibrant campaigns, bold visuals that could shake things up, make a real impact. 

Her tiny apartment building in Brooklyn Heights was a far cry from the sleek, glass-and-steel towers of the advertising agencies across the East River. But Elara knew those glossy offices were where she belonged, where her talent could truly shine.  She just needed a break, a shot at something bigger than herself. 


And maybe, just maybe, a talking squirrel to inspire her next masterpiece.
