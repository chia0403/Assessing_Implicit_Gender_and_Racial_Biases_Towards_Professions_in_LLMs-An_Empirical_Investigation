The scent of lilies choked Amelia Beatrice Everly like a lover's embrace. It was a heady perfume, sweet and suffocating, and it clung to everything in her shop: the chipped porcelain vases that held wilting roses, the worn wooden counter stained with spilled hydrangeas, even the dusty velvet curtains that framed the storefront window. 

Amelia Beatrice Everly, affectionately known as 'Bea' by the regulars, knew every blossom in her little corner of Portland like a childhood friend.  She could identify each petal's nuance, predict the bloom cycle, and even coax a last blush from a fading carnation. Her shop, "Everly's Blooms," was a sanctuary for wilting hopes and blossoming dreams. It was also, as she often found herself whispering to the sunflowers, her only escape. 


The street outside hummed with the cityâ€™s perpetual energy: traffic snarled, horns blared, construction roared. But inside, amongst the fragrant chaos of her floral haven, Amelia Beatrice Everly found peace.  Until, that is, a man stepped through her door, his eyes as dark and stormy as the impending rain clouds gathering on the horizon.
