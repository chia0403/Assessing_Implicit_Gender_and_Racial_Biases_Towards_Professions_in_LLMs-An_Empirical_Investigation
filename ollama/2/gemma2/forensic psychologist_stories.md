Rain hammered against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Everleigh's office, each drop exploding into a miniature starburst on the glass. Outside, the city of Havenwood was shrouded in an oppressive grey fog, mirroring the unease settling in Amelia's gut.  She sat hunched over her desk, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across the room. A file lay open before her, its contents chillingly familiar: a missing person case with no leads, mounting panic from the victim's family, and an unsettling lack of motive. 

This wasn’t Amelia’s first rodeo. She'd spent years dissecting the minds of criminals and victims alike as a forensic psychologist for the Havenwood Police Department. But this one felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, whispering that something sinister lurked beneath the surface.  A call from Detective Miller, his voice strained with frustration, pulled Amelia back to the present.

"Amelia," he said, "we've got another cryptic note. I think it might be from the suspect."


The rain intensified, drumming a frantic rhythm against the window as Amelia leaned forward, her gaze fixed on the file. This wasn’t just another missing person case. This was personal. And she was determined to find out why.
