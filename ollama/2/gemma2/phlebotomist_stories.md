The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Rosalind Hayes, casting a sterile glow on the plastic-covered armrest she adjusted for her next patient.  Amelia, nicknamed Amy by colleagues who found her last name too grand for someone drawing blood, wasn't particularly fond of the hushed sterility of the clinic. She preferred the vibrant chaos of city life, the clamor of street vendors and honking taxis, a stark contrast to the rhythmic beeping of the vitals monitor and the quiet shuffling of patients in the waiting area.

The setting sun bled through the dusty windowpanes, painting the room in hues of bruised orange and fading lavender. Outside, a dog barked, its cry swallowed by the hum of traffic on Elm Street. Inside, Amelia waited for her next patient, the prickle of anticipation dancing beneath her skin - a familiar thrill that came with every draw, a momentary connection forged through a needle and vein.
