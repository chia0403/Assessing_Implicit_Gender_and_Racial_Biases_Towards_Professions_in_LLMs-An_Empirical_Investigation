The scent of lavender and beeswax hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint tang of steel from the needles pricking through fabric. Sunlight streamed through the shop window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm golden light. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Prague thrummed with life – vendors hawking their wares, children chasing stray cats, and carriages clattering past. But inside “Atelier Eleanor,” a haven of hushed creativity reigned supreme. 

Eleanor Vondra, her hands nimble and quick, adjusted the delicate embroidery on a crimson silk gown, humming softly to herself. Her fingers moved with practiced ease, stitching together a vision of elegance that would soon grace the grand ball at the Old Town Square. The dress was for Madame Zborovska, Prague’s most influential socialite, known for her discerning eye and love of the dramatic.  

Eleanor prided herself on capturing the essence of each client in her creations – their personality, dreams, even their secrets whispered to her over cups of strong, black coffee. Today, however, a restlessness gnawed at her. The familiar rhythm of needle and thread felt off-kilter. A shadow had crept into her usually joyful workshop, one that had begun with a whisper and now seemed to grow louder with each passing day.
