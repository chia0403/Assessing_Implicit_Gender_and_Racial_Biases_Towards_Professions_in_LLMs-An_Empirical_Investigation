The fluorescent lights hummed above Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sterile glow over the aisles of "Everything & More," the discount store where she worked nights. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale coffee and cleaning chemicals, punctuated by the occasional burst of cheap perfume from a passing customer. Evelyn, bored as ever, counted down the minutes until her shift ended. It was 10:47 PM, the slowest hour of the night, and the only other person in the store besides herself was a man hunched over a display of dusty board games, humming softly to himself. 

Evelyn chewed on a thumbnail, watching him through the reflection of the register's touchscreen. She wished she had something interesting to do, anything to break the monotony of scanning groceries and bagging items into plastic sacks. Then, a jingle announced someone entering the store. It was too late for anyone shopping for necessities. 

Evelyn turned, expecting another lonely soul seeking refuge in the aisles. Instead, she found herself staring into the dark eyes of a woman who seemed to shimmer faintly under the harsh lights. Her clothes were strangely out of place â€“ a flowing crimson dress that whispered of bygone eras paired with worn leather boots. The woman smiled, revealing teeth like pearls. 

"Good evening," she said, her voice like wind chimes. "I believe I require assistance."
