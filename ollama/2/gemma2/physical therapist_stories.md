The insistent drip of rain against the corrugated iron roof was the soundtrack to Amelia Brightwell’s morning.  Amelia, a woman whose youthful energy still flickered through her silvering hair, adjusted the warm weight of her cardigan as she surveyed her small but well-equipped clinic nestled in the heart of rural Scotland. 

Nestled amongst rolling green hills and grazing sheep just outside the quaint village of Lochlann, The Willow Walk Clinic was Amelia’s haven.  Sunlight streamed through the dusty panes, illuminating the rows of exercise mats, resistance bands dangling from hooks like colorful stalactites, and a collection of antique medical posters showcasing the evolution of physical therapy throughout history. The scent of pine needles and damp earth lingered in the air, a reminder that even on days cloaked in grey, nature held a quiet beauty.

Today, Amelia's first patient was due – a young sheep farmer named Finn, struggling with the aftermath of a harrowing fall from his prize ram. A familiar ache settled in Amelia’s chest, not for Finn’s pain, but for the resilience these people possessed, their ability to face hardship head-on and emerge stronger.  She took a deep breath, her gaze settling on the worn leather couch where she would soon sit with Finn, listening to his story, assessing his injury, and, above all, offering him hope.
