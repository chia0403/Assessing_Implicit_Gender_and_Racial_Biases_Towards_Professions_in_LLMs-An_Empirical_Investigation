The aroma of turmeric-ginger tea hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint scent of lavender essential oil diffuser. Sunlight streamed through the large windows of Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's consultation room, illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden rays. Outside, the bustling city of Chicago hummed with its usual cacophony, but within these walls, a sense of calm prevailed.  

Amelia sat across from her client, Mr. Davis, a man whose slumped posture and drawn features spoke volumes about his struggle with chronic fatigue. His latest bloodwork revealed concerning levels of iron deficiency, and Amelia knew that addressing his dietary habits was crucial to his recovery. She smiled encouragingly, hoping to inspire a spark of hope in the weary eyes staring back at her. 

"So, Mr. Davis," she began, her voice warm and reassuring, "let's talk about what you're eating now."
