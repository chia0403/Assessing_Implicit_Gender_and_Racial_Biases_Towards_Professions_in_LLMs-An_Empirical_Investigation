Dust motes danced in the pale beam, mimicking the restless energy churning within her. Outside, the clamor of the city – sirens wailing, horns blaring, a symphony of urban chaos – was muffled by the thick walls of the architectural firm. But even here, in this quiet sanctuary of steel and glass, Amelia felt trapped. 

She ran a gloved hand over the intricate lines of the proposed skyscraper, tracing its elegant curves and sharp angles with practiced ease. Each stroke was precise, calculated, reflecting the meticulous nature of her work. Yet, beneath the surface, a yearning for something more gnawed at her.  Amelia wasn't content simply bringing architects' visions to life; she longed to create, to leave her own mark on the world beyond these sterile blueprints. 


Her gaze drifted towards the window, where the city skyline stretched endlessly before her, a concrete jungle teeming with possibilities. One day, Amelia vowed, she wouldn't just be the architect's hand, but the architect herself.
