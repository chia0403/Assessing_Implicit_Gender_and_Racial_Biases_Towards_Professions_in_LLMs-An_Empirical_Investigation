Here's a potential story opening and setting for a novel featuring a clinical psychologist as the main character:

The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the sleepy coastal town of Ravenswood-by-Sea, casting a pale light over the quaint streets and weathered buildings that seemed to lean in, as if sharing secrets. Dr. Emilia Grey, a renowned clinical psychologist with a sharp mind and a compassionate heart, stood at the edge of the ocean, her feet planted firmly on the sandy shore. The sound of seagulls filled the air as she gazed out at the waves, the rhythmic crash of the surf a soothing balm for her frazzled nerves.

It had been a long week, filled with grueling sessions and paperwork that seemed to grow more suffocating by the minute. Emilia's practice, nestled in the heart of Ravenswood's bustling town center, was always busy, but lately, it felt like she was drowning in a sea of demanding patients and dwindling resources. As she breathed in the salty air, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off – a nagging sense of discontent that had been growing inside her for weeks.

Just then, her phone buzzed with an incoming text from her assistant, Rachel: "Dr. Grey, you have a new patient arriving at 9 am sharp. Name is Emily Wilson. Family background unclear. Please review her file ASAP."

Emilia's eyes narrowed as she processed the message. A new patient? And one whose family background was shrouded in mystery? This could be just what she needed – a fresh challenge to shake off the monotony of her routine.

With a sense of excitement and trepidation, Emilia turned to walk back into the world, ready to face whatever lay ahead. Little did she know, this new patient would change everything.
