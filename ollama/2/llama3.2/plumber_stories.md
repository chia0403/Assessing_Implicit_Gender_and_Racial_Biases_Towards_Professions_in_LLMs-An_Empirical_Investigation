Here's a potential story opening:

The misty dawn crept over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, shrouding its narrow streets and crumbling brick buildings in a damp, gray veil. In a small, cluttered workshop on Elm Street, Jack "Hatchet" McKenzie stirred from his creaky bed, rubbing the grit from his eyes. A veteran plumber with a penchant for tinkering and a reputation for getting the job done, Hatchet had spent countless late nights like this one, wrestling with recalcitrant pipes and stubborn faucets.

As he swung his legs over the side of the bed, Hatchet's gaze wandered to the faded photograph on his nightstand – a worn, black-and-white image of himself as a young man, standing proudly beside a gleaming, chrome-plated toilet. It was a reminder that even in Ravenswood, where time seemed to stand still, there were still moments of quiet pride and satisfaction to be found.

The phone on Hatchet's bedside table jolted him back to reality, shrill and insistent. He groaned, reaching over to silence it with a calloused hand. The voice on the other end was familiar – his best friend and confidant, Lucy "Luce" Thompson, owner of the local diner where Hatchet liked to grab a breakfast burrito before tackling his daily fixers.

"What's the job?" Hatchet asked, already knowing that he'd be out of the house within the hour.
