Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The rain pattered against the worn glass of the offices' front door like a metronome on repeat, casting a melancholy rhythm that seemed to match the cadence of Emily Josephine Wilson's own weary heartbeat. As she sorted through the day's mail with a practiced hand, her gaze drifted out the window at the grey, sodden streets of downtown Ashwood, where the towering skyscrapers seemed to stretch on forever like skeletal fingers reaching for the sky.

Emily, or Emmie as few people called her outside of work, was the first face that clients saw when they walked through the door of Smith & Co., a mid-sized law firm with a reputation for being one of the most reliable in town. As the receptionist, she was the gatekeeper to the inner sanctum of lawyers and partners who spent their days arguing cases and making deals, but on a drizzly Monday morning like this, Emily's thoughts were more focused on the stack of bills that needed paying and the lukewarm coffee that seemed to be her only comfort.

As the phone rang for what felt like the hundredth time, Emmie's eyes flickered towards it, her hand instinctively reaching out to answer before she even realized who was calling. Another client, no doubt, with another question or complaint about some minor detail that had somehow become a major issue. It was days like this that made Emily wonder if she'd ever make it out of the drab, fluorescent-lit office alive.
