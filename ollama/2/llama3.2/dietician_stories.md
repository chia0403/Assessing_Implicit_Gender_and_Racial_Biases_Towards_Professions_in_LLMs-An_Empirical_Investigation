Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

Dr. Alexandra Isabella Thompson stepped out of her small office in the historic district of Portland, Oregon, and took a deep breath of the crisp morning air. The fog rolled in off the Willamette River, casting a misty veil over the bustling streets of the city. As a registered dietician with a specialty in sports nutrition, Alexandra was no stranger to early mornings, but she loved starting her day at dawn, when the world felt fresh and full of possibility.

Alexandra's office, tucked away on a quiet side street, was a cozy haven filled with natural light and the scent of freshly brewed coffee. She had spent years building a reputation as one of Portland's top sports dietitians, working with athletes and fitness enthusiasts to optimize their nutrition for peak performance. Her clients included professional soccer players, marathon runners, and even some of the city's top triathletes.

As she made her way back to her car, parked on the street outside her office, Alexandra couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. She had a feeling that today would be different from any other day at the office - perhaps it was the lingering sense of unease that had been nagging her since the night before's phone call from her sister, or maybe it was just the way the morning light seemed to dance across the water.

Whatever it was, Alexandra felt a thrill of anticipation as she set off towards the hospital where she worked part-time. It was going to be an interesting day.
