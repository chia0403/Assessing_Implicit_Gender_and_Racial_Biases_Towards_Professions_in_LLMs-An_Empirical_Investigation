Here's a potential story opening:

As she pushed open the creaky door to the dusty library on the outskirts of town, Emily Adelaide Windsor smiled to herself, feeling like she was slipping into her favorite hiding place. The worn wooden shelves seemed to close in around her, enveloping her in a sense of comfort and quiet that she often found lacking in the rest of the world.

The small library, housed in a converted Victorian-era schoolhouse, was Emily's sanctuary. As the town's librarian, she had spent countless hours within its walls, surrounded by shelves upon shelves of books that whispered secrets to each other when the lights were low. The air was thick with the scent of old paper and forgotten knowledge, and Emily felt like she could breathe more deeply here than anywhere else.

It was a chilly autumn evening, and the sun had just set over the town's main street, casting long shadows across the pavement. Outside, the only sound was the distant hum of crickets and the occasional rumble of cars driving by on the highway. Inside, the library was quiet, except for the soft ticking of the old clock in the corner of the room.

Emily took a moment to adjust her glasses and survey the rows of books that lined the shelves. She loved this time of day, when the world seemed to slow down and all that mattered was the next page to turn. Little did she know, however, that tonight would bring a discovery that would change everything.
