Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Red Rock, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty main street and the rundown buildings that lined it. Amidst the worn facades and faded signs, one building stood out: the old construction company owned by Jack "Mac" McAllister, where his nephew, Tyler James McAllister, had worked as a carpenter for five years.

Tyler, or Ty to those who knew him, was a ruggedly handsome young man with a strong jawline and a quick wit. He had grown up watching his uncle Mac work, learning the ins and outs of the construction trade from a young age. After high school, he had left to make a name for himself in the city, but after a few years of struggling to find steady work, he had returned to Red Rock to help out on the family business.

As Ty made his way through the deserted streets, his truck's tires kicking up small clouds of dust, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The company had been quiet all day, with only a handful of workers filtering in to start their shift. And Mac... well, Ty's uncle hadn't shown up for work at all.

A shiver ran down Ty's spine as he pulled into the parking lot and killed the engine. He was about to radio the office when his phone buzzed with an incoming text from his sister, Emily: "Call me ASAP. I need to talk to you about something."
