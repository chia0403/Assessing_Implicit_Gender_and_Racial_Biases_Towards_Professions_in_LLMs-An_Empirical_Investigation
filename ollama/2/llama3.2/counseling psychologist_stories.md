Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Portland glistened like polished onyx as Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office building, the soft glow of the streetlights casting an ethereal ambiance over the bustling city. As she breathed in the damp air, the scent of wet earth and ozone filled her lungs, a familiar comfort that always seemed to clear her mind. A counseling psychologist with a private practice specializing in trauma recovery, Lexi had spent countless hours walking these same streets, listening to the stories of her clients as they navigated the darkest corners of their own lives.

Tonight was no different. As she made her way across the street, the sound of raindrops pattering against the pavement accompanied her thoughts, which were consumed by a new client waiting for her in her office – a young woman named Sarah who had been struggling to come to terms with the aftermath of a devastating car accident that had left her with physical and emotional scars. Lexi's eyes scanned the crowded sidewalk, her trained gaze searching for any signs of distress or disquiet among the passersby, but all seemed calm and collected.

As she reached the curb, Lexi fished out her phone to check the time – 7:47 PM. She had exactly thirty minutes before Sarah arrived, a window of quiet reflection that allowed her to mentally prepare for their session ahead. With a gentle sigh, she tucked her phone away, feeling the weight of responsibility settle onto her shoulders once more. Tonight, she would be not only a listener but also a guide, helping Sarah find the strength and resilience to rebuild her shattered life.

How's this? I've created a setting that showcases Lexi's connection to her city and her profession as a counseling psychologist. The rain-soaked streets of Portland provide a moody backdrop for the story, while Lexi's thoughts and actions reveal her expertise and compassion. Let me know if you'd like me to make any changes!
