Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

The sun had just begun to set over the towering skyscrapers of Manhattan, casting a golden glow over the bustling streets of Lower Manhattan. The sound of car horns and chatter filled the air as people rushed to and fro, their faces aglow with the soft light of smartphones.

Inside the sleek, modern high-rise office building at 500 Broad Street, stockbroker Alexander "Lex" Thompson sat at his desk, staring blankly at the computer screen in front of him. His eyes were bloodshot from a long day of trading, and his usually immaculate suit was rumpled from a night spent out on the town.

At 32 years old, Lex had made a name for himself as one of the top stockbrokers on Wall Street. He had an uncanny ability to read market trends and make bold predictions that often paid off in big ways. But despite his success, Lex couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside him all day, and he couldn't quite put his finger on what it was.

As he sipped his lukewarm coffee, Lex's phone suddenly rang, shrill in the quiet office. He picked up the receiver, expecting it to be a colleague or perhaps a client with a question about their portfolio. But instead, he heard a low, gravelly voice on the other end of the line.

"Lex, it's been a while," the voice said. "I think we need to talk."

Lex's heart skipped a beat as he recognized the voice. It was his old mentor, Henry Lee, a retired hedge fund manager who had taken Lex under his wing all those years ago. Henry was known for being ruthless and cunning in the world of finance, but there was something about his tone that sent a shiver down Lex's spine.

"What is it, Henry?" Lex asked, trying to keep his voice steady.

"I have some news," Henry said, his voice dripping with menace. "Something big. And I think you should be very interested."

Lex leaned forward in his chair, his mind racing with possibilities. He had a feeling that this conversation was going to change everything.
