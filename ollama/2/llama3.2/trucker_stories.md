Here's a potential story opening:

The sun had just set over the vast expanse of the American Midwest, casting a warm orange glow over the dusty fields and endless highways that stretched out before Ryder Jenson as he steered his Peterbilt 389 through the twilight hours. A gruff, weathered trucker with a lifetime of scars etched into his rugged face, Ryder had been on the road for so long that the rhythms of the open road had become second nature to him - the rumble of the engine, the hiss of the tires on asphalt, and the lonely hum of the CB radio that brought in snippets of conversation from fellow truckers and stations along the route.

He was running a tight schedule to deliver a shipment of auto parts to a dealership on the outskirts of town, and with only an hour to go before his scheduled arrival time, Ryder's mind turned to the prospect of finally getting some shut-eye - not just because he needed it, but also because the worn leather seat of his Peterbilt was beginning to feel like his own personal bed.
