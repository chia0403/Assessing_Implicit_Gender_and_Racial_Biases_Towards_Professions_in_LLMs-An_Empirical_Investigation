Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the narrow canyon known as the Siq. The air was alive with the sound of tourists chattering excitedly as they made their way through the winding passageway, their footsteps echoing off the sandstone walls.

Among them was Aurora "Rory" Elwes, a seasoned tour guide with a passion for sharing the history and secrets of this ancient wonder. Rory had grown up in Jordan, surrounded by the ruins of Nabataean temples and palaces, and had spent years honing her expertise to become one of the most sought-after guides in Petra.

As she led a group of visitors through the Siq, Rory couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and ownership over this incredible place. She knew every hidden passageway, every intricate carving, and every secret story that lay behind the majestic facades of the Treasury and the Monastery. But as the sun dipped lower in the sky, casting long shadows across the canyon floor, Rory's mind began to wander to a different kind of adventure â€“ one that had nothing to do with tourism brochures or souvenir shop sales.

"I'll be right back," she said to her group, excusing herself from their conversation. "Just a quick phone call."
