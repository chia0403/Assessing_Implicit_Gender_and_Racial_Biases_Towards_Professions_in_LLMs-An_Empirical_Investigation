Here's a potential story opening:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle, Washington, and the rain-soaked streets were eerily quiet as Evelyn Rae Jensen trudged through the mist-shrouded sidewalks, her eyes fixed on the sleek glass tower of the Azure Towers high-rise apartment complex. As a top-performing salesperson at the prestigious luxury real estate firm, Azure Realty Group, Evelyn had spent countless hours navigating these very same streets, touting the virtues of sleek penthouses and lavish amenities to discerning clients like herself.

With her sleek black hair pulled back into a tight ponytail and a tailored silver-gray business suit that seemed to shimmer in the dim light, Evelyn exuded an air of confident competence that had earned her a coveted spot among the firm's top producers. But despite her outward success, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - a nagging sense of unease that had been growing inside her for weeks, like a faint humming in the background of her mind.

As she pushed open the glass door and stepped into the gleaming lobby of Azure Towers, Evelyn's gaze swept across the polished marble floor, taking in the glittering chandelier and the rows of gleaming high-end cars parked beneath the floor-to-ceiling windows. It was a world away from the cramped apartment complex where she had grown up, the one where her single mother had worked multiple jobs just to make ends meet.

And yet, as Evelyn made her way toward the elevator, a sense of familiarity began to creep over her, like the scent of old books and stale air wafting up from the depths of some forgotten memory. What was it about this place that felt so... familiar?
