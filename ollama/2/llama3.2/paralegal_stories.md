Here's a potential story opening and setting for you:

---

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Emily J. Thompson, a seasoned paralegal with over a decade of experience under her belt, stepped out of the drizzly evening air and into the warm, golden glow of the law firm's lobby. The sound of dripping water from the high-rise building's overhead pipes and the soft hum of the fluorescent lights above created a soothing melody that seemed to lull the city itself into a state of quiet contemplation.

As she hung up her umbrella and made her way to the reception desk, Emily couldn't help but feel a sense of unease settle in the pit of her stomach. It wasn't just the rain or the drizzle of morning coffee that was making her feel this way - it was the looming deadline for the Smithson v. Pacific Northwest Timber Corporation case, which was set to go to trial in less than three weeks.

The Smithsons, a family of seasoned loggers and environmental activists, had been fighting against the corporation's plans to clear-cut a significant portion of old-growth forestland in the nearby Olympic National Park for what they saw as unsustainable logging practices. Emily had spent countless hours reviewing documents, interviewing key witnesses, and pouring over complex contracts - all in an effort to help the Smithsons make their case against the corporation.

As she waited for her name to be called by the receptionist, Emily's mind began to wander back to the days when she was a young paralegal, fresh out of law school and eager to prove herself. She had always been passionate about social justice, and the prospect of taking on cases that aligned with her values had seemed like a dream come true.

But as the years went by, Emily had begun to realize that the line between idealism and pragmatism was often blurred - especially in the cutthroat world of corporate law. Still, she couldn't shake the feeling that this case might be different, that there was something about the Smithsons' fight against the corporation's destructive practices that resonated deeply with her own sense of purpose.

The receptionist finally called out Emily's name, and she rose from her seat, smoothing out her dress and taking a deep breath as she made her way to the elevator. It was going to be a long night.
