Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Edinburgh gleamed like polished stone as Emilia Victoria Wellesley stepped out of her small apartment and into the misty morning air. A faint scent of damp earth and seaweed wafted up from the cobblestones, mingling with the salty tang of the Firth of Forth. It was a familiar aroma that brought a sense of comfort to Emilia's senses, one that she had grown up with during her childhood explorations of this ancient city.

As an editor at a small publishing house on South Bridge, Emilia spent most of her days hunched over manuscripts and pouring over lines of prose, searching for the perfect words to bring authors' visions to life. But on this particular morning, Emilia had other plans. She was meeting a new client, one who promised to shake up the literary world with their bold and provocative novel. The promise of adventure and creative challenge was tantalizing enough, but what really drew her in was the whisper of rumors surrounding the author's troubled past.

As she made her way through the crowded streets, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that this meeting might be more than just a chance to make some new connections – it could be the start of something much bigger. Little did she know, this ordinary day would soon unravel into a tangled web of secrets, lies, and literary sabotage that would test her skills as an editor and push her own boundaries as a writer.

The city was quiet, save for the sound of dripping water from the ornate spires of St. Giles' Cathedral, which loomed above the bustling streets like a sentinel. It was a place where Emilia felt most at home – a place where words had power to shape and mold the world around her.
