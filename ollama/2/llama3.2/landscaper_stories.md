Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the sleepy streets and homes. In a small shed nestled at the back of his property, a weathered sign creaked in the gentle breeze: "Green Thumb Landscaping - Jack Harrison". Jack, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-30s with a strong jawline and a mess of curly brown hair, was a master landscaper with a passion for bringing beauty to the homes and gardens of his customers. He had spent years honing his skills, working hard to build a reputation as one of the best in the business.

As he wiped the sweat from his brow, Jack gazed out at the vibrant garden he had just finished tending - a riot of colorful flowers and lush greenery that seemed to dance in the fading light. It was moments like these that made all the hard work worth it. But as he took a deep breath of the evening air, a sense of unease began to creep over him. A mysterious letter had arrived at his shop earlier that day, its contents cryptic and unsettling.

The letter, with no return address and only a single sentence scrawled on a plain sheet of paper: "They're coming for you, Jack Harrison."
