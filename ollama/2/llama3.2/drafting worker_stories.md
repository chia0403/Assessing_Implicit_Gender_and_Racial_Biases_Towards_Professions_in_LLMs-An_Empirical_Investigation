Here's a potential story opening:

The misty dawn crept over the industrial landscape of Ashwood, casting an eerie gloom over the rows of factories and warehouses that lined the canal. The air was thick with the acrid smell of coal smoke and machine oil, a constant reminder of the city's reputation as one of the most polluted in the country.

In a small, cramped office nestled between two larger buildings, a lone figure stirred from his bed of worn blankets. Ezechiel Thaddeus Fothergill, or Zeke to those who knew him, rubbed the sleep from his eyes and swung his legs over the side of the creaking metal frame that served as his bed. A drafting worker at Ashwood's largest textile mill, Zeke had spent countless hours hunched over a drafting table, drawing intricate diagrams and designs for the complex machinery that kept the factory running.

As he shucked on his worn work clothes, the sounds of the city began to stir outside: the rumble of trucks, the chatter of pedestrians, and the wail of sirens in the distance. It was going to be another long day at the mill, but Zeke was ready. He had a design to finish, and a paycheck to bring home to his family.

Note: I chose the name Ezechiel Thaddeus Fothergill because it has a somewhat old-fashioned feel to it, which fits with the story's industrial setting and the idea of a working-class protagonist.
