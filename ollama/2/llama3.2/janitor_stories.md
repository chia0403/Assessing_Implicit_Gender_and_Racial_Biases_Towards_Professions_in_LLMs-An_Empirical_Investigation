Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights above the school's cafeteria flickered and hummed, casting an eerie glow over the empty tables and chairs. The smell of stale pizza crusts and yesterday's Chinese takeout lingered in the air, mingling with the faint scent of disinfectant wafting from the janitorial carts.

It was 6:00 AM on a crisp autumn morning, and the school was still quiet, except for the soft hum of the ventilation system and the distant rumble of the city outside. In the corner of the cafeteria, where the tables were pushed against the walls to make room for more storage, 17-year-old Jeremiah "Jerry" Winters scrubbed down a particularly stubborn stain on the floor with a look of quiet satisfaction.

As the son of a single mother who worked two jobs just to keep food on the table, Jerry had learned early on to appreciate the small pleasures in life. Like watching the sun rise over the city from his window seat at school, or feeling the warmth of the morning dew on his skin as he walked home from the bus stop.

But even for someone like Jerry, who loved nothing more than a good cup of coffee and a quiet moment to himself before the chaos of the day began, today felt different. Today was going to be one of those days where everything seemed to conspire against him, starting with a mysterious note on his locker that read: "They're watching you."

Little did Jerry know, this ordinary-sounding school would soon become a battleground in a world beyond his wildest imagination, and the quiet janitor's life was about to take a drastic turn for the worse.
