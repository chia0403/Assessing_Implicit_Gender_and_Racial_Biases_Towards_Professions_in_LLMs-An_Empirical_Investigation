The humid air hung heavy in Elspeth Merriweather's atelier, thick with the scent of lavender sachet powder and the faint tang of sweat. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windowpanes, illuminating motes of dust dancing above the cluttered worktable. Bolts of silk and velvet spilled from overflowing shelves, their colours muted by the afternoon haze. Outside, the cobblestone streets of London buzzed with the clatter of carriages and the cries of street vendors, but within Elspeth's haven, time seemed to move at a slower pace. 

Elspeth herself, a woman whose age was as impossible to determine as the origin of her myriad silks, stood hunched over her latest commission: a gown for Lady Amelia Hawthorne, destined to be worn at the season's most anticipated ball. Her nimble fingers danced across the shimmering fabric, coaxing it into the desired shape with practiced ease. 

But even amidst the familiar comfort of her craft, a restless unease tugged at Elspeth's heart. A mysterious letter had arrived that morning, its seal bearing an unfamiliar crest and its contents shrouded in cryptic warnings. The words "hidden threads" and "dangers unseen" echoed in her mind, casting a shadow over the normally joyous rhythm of her work.
