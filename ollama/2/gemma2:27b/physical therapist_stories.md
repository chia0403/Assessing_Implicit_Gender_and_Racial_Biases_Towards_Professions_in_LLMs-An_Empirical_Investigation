Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Renew Physical Therapy," blurring the neon sign into a kaleidoscope of color. Inside, Amelia Hawthorne adjusted her spectacles, their frames reflecting the dim light cast by the single flickering fluorescent bulb above her workstation. The scent of stale disinfectant and liniment hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint but persistent aroma of lavender hand cream that Amelia religiously applied after every patient. She sighed, rubbing weary eyes. It had been a long day, filled with the same repetitive stretches and exercises.

Today, though, felt different. A tremor of anticipation vibrated beneath Amelia's skin, a sensation she hadn't felt since starting at Renew three years ago.  The clinic was buzzing with whispers about the new patient arriving today â€“ a renowned concert violinist who had suffered a debilitating hand injury. His name was Lucian Moreau, and rumors of his fiery temperament and unparalleled talent preceded him. This wasn't just another sprained ankle or stiff shoulder; this was a chance to work with someone who understood the power and fragility of the human body, someone whose livelihood depended on Amelia's skill.

A sharp rap on the door startled her. Amelia straightened, smoothing down her navy blue scrubs. "Come in," she called, her voice betraying none of the nervous flutter in her chest.
