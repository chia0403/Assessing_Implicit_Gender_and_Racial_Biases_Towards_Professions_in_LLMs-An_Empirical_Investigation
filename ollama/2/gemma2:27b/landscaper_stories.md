The late afternoon sun dripped honey-gold over the meticulously manicured lawns of Oakhaven Estates, casting long shadows from the ancient oaks that gave the neighborhood its name.  Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright, her weathered hands gripping the handle of her trusty hand pruner, surveyed her latest masterpiece with a critical eye. 

Every blade of grass on Mrs. Vandermeer's sprawling emerald lawn was standing at perfect attention; the hydrangeas bordering the walkway bloomed in a riot of lavender and pink; and the delicate scent of roses drifted on the warm breeze. Evelyn took pride in transforming ordinary yards into vibrant oases, but something felt amiss today. A prickling unease crawled under her skin, like an unwelcome weed taking root.

Perhaps it was the unsettling stillness of the air, or the way the shadows seemed to twist and stretch as the sun dipped lower. Or maybe it was the faint whisper she thought she heard, carried on the wind from deep within the overgrown woods bordering Oakhaven. A whisper that sounded suspiciously like a nameâ€¦ Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright.
