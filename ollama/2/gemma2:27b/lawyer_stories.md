Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane, blurring the neon glow of the "Lucky Dragon" sign across the street. Amelia Kensington, her sharp cheekbones illuminated by the desk lamp, chewed on the end of her pen, frustration etching lines around her eyes. The air in her tiny office, crammed between a laundromat and a fortune teller's parlor, was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation. 

Her latest client, a nervous young man named Leo, sat opposite her, picking at a thread on his threadbare jacket. His case – defending him against trumped-up assault charges – hinged on finding a witness who could corroborate his story. A witness Amelia had yet to find, despite days of scouring the seedy underbelly of Chinatown. 


The clock ticked relentlessly, each second a hammer blow to her already frayed nerves.  If she didn't find that witness soon, Leo would be another casualty in the city's merciless legal system.
