The air hung heavy with the scent of woodsmoke and fear.  Flames licked greedily at the aging Victorian house, casting grotesque shadows that danced against the swirling smoke.  Captain Amelia "Amy" Thorne gripped her axe tighter, her knuckles white against the worn handle. Her helmet reflected the inferno's orange glow, making her emerald eyes appear like smoldering coals.

This wasn't just another fire; this was personal. Amy had grown up three blocks down, spending countless childhood summers playing tag in the overgrown garden behind this very house. Memories of lemonade stands and stolen raspberries flooded back, bittersweet against the backdrop of crackling flames and terrified screams echoing from within.
