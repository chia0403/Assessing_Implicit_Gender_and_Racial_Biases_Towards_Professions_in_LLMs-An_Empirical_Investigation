Rain lashed against the arched windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's practice, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign into an anemic smear. The insistent drumming was a fitting soundtrack to her mood. Another Wednesday, another string of appointments with people whose backs were as knotted as the traffic on Highway 101.

Evelyn wasn't unhappy – she genuinely loved helping people find relief from their aches and pains. But lately, it felt like something was missing. The routine had become stifling, the constant adjustments repetitive. She longed for a challenge, something beyond aligning vertebrae and recommending stretches.

Her gaze drifted towards the framed photograph on her desk – a younger Evelyn, beaming beside a snow-capped peak in the Himalayas. It was from her backpacking trip after graduating chiropractic school, a time of freedom and adventure. Maybe it was time to dust off those hiking boots and find some inspiration again.
