The first tendrils of dawn were just beginning to claw their way over the horizon, painting the sky in shades of bruised purple and faded orange, when Elijah "Eli" Finch unlocked the rusted gate leading into Whispering Pines Cemetery. The air was still crisp with the remnants of night, carrying the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves â€“ a smell Eli had grown strangely accustomed to, even fond of.

Whispering Pines wasn't your typical cemetery. It sprawled across a hillside overlooking the sleepy town of Oakhaven, its headstones tilted at whimsical angles as if engaged in a silent conversation with the wind. Ancient oaks draped their gnarled branches over weathered mausoleums and moss-covered statues, creating an atmosphere both serene and undeniably eerie. 

Eli, with his calloused hands and sun-weathered face, was the lone caretaker of this peculiar sanctuary. He knew every inch of it, from the crooked headstone marking the final resting place of a forgotten sea captain to the hidden nook where wildflowers bloomed defiantly amidst the tombstones. Today, however, something felt different. The wind whispered through the trees with an unusual urgency, and the shadows seemed to dance in a way they never had before. As Eli pushed his rusted wheelbarrow up the winding path towards the overgrown rose garden, he couldn't shake the feeling that he was being watched.
