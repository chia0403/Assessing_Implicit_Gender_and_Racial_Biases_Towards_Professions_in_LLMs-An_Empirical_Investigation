Rain lashed against the windows of "Nourish & Thrive," blurring the vibrant mural depicting overflowing baskets of fruit and vegetables on the storefront. Inside, Eleanor Cavendish meticulously arranged quinoa flakes into neat rows on a wooden tray. Her brow furrowed in concentration as she considered the ideal ratio of nuts and dried cranberries to complement the earthy grains.

Eleanor wasn't just any nutritionist; she was on a mission. Having witnessed firsthand the devastating effects of poor diet in her own family, she dedicated herself to empowering others through food. "Nourish & Thrive" wasn't just a business, it was a haven for those seeking healthier lives. But today, Eleanor felt a gnawing unease. A new client was arriving soon - someone who had requested a strictly vegan meal plan, despite having no prior experience with plant-based eating.  Eleanor worried about setting unrealistic expectations, especially given the demanding nature of the individual's job: a high-powered attorney known for her relentless drive and uncompromising standards.
