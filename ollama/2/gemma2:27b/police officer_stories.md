Rain lashed against the cracked windshield of Officer Amelia "Amy" Santiago's patrol car, blurring the neon glow of the 'Open 24 Hours' sign at Benny's Diner. It was 3:00 AM, and the greasy spoon was the only thing in sight on this desolate stretch of Highway 68. The wind howled through the gaps in her car door seal, making a mournful sound that echoed the gnawing emptiness in Amy's stomach.  She hadn't had a decent meal since breakfast, and the smell of frying bacon wafting from Benny's was starting to drive her mad.

Just as she contemplated braving the downpour for a cup of coffee and a greasy burger, her radio crackled to life. "Dispatch to Unit 42. We have a possible 10-31 in progress at the abandoned motel on Elm Street."  Amy sighed, pushing back the disappointment that threatened to overwhelm her. Duty called, even if it meant forgoing bacon.

Elm Street Motel. A crumbling relic from a bygone era, its neon vacancy sign flickered intermittently, casting eerie shadows across the overgrown parking lot. It was notorious in this sleepy town - whispered rumors of drug deals and disappearances clung to it like cobwebs.  Amy gripped the steering wheel, her knuckles white as she pulled up to the entrance. This wasn't going to be a quick coffee break.
