The scent of jasmine and acetone hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that both soothed and stung Esmeralda "Esme" Diaz's nostrils. Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on Calle Ocho, turning the sidewalks into shimmering mirages. But inside Esme's Nails, the world was cool and vibrant, alive with the chatter of clients and the rhythmic click of nail files. 

Esme, her ebony hair pulled back in a tight braid, hummed along to Celia Cruz blasting from the radio as she expertly sculpted a client's acrylic nails into stiletto points. Her hands moved with practiced grace, each stroke purposeful and precise. But despite the cheerful fa√ßade, a knot of unease tightened in Esme's stomach. Business had been slow lately, and whispers of a new salon opening down the street filled her with dread.

Today, though, she was determined to focus on the present. A young woman with vibrant purple hair sat patiently across from her, her eyes sparkling with anticipation. "Ready for something fierce?" Esme asked, her Cuban accent lilting as she held up a bottle of shimmering emerald green polish.
