The flickering neon sign outside The Rusty Nail cast an unsettling purple hue across Eleanor Vance's face as she stepped onto the cracked asphalt. Rain slicked the street, reflecting the greasy glow of the bar in distorted puddles. A chill wind, laced with the metallic tang of exhaust fumes and cheap beer, tugged at her wool coat.

Eleanor was used to this kind of environment. Five years on the force, three as a probation officer, had hardened her against the grit and grime of the city's underbelly. But tonight, something felt different. A knot of anxiety tightened in her stomach. Her client, Liam "Sparks" O'Connell, notorious for his quick temper and even quicker fists, was supposed to be meeting her here at 8 pm sharp.

It was now 8:15. The bar door swung open with a groan, releasing a wave of raucous laughter and the pungent smell of stale cigarettes. Eleanor braced herself, pushing through the throng of bodies towards the back booth where Sparks usually held court. This meeting wasn't just about his probation violations - it was about a whispered tip, an anonymous call claiming Liam knew something about a recent string of violent robberies. 


Eleanor hoped she wasn't walking into a trap. But deep down, she knew Liam O'Connell was the key to cracking this case wide open. And she was determined to get answers, no matter the cost.
