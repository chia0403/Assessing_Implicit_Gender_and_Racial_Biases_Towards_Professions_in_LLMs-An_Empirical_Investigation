Rain hammered against the dusty glass storefront, blurring the neon sign that flickered "Blooms & Bliss." Inside, Eloise Evelyn Beaumont, her freckled nose practically touching a bouquet of anemones, sighed. The storm had chased away the usual Saturday morning bustle, leaving only the melancholic ticking of the antique clock on the wall and the gentle rustle of wind chimes.

Eloise, with her unruly auburn braid snaking down her back and her fingers stained green from countless hours tending to her floral babies, was beginning to worry. She'd ordered a mountain of lilies for a large wedding that afternoon, and now they sat in their buckets, pristine white blooms threatening to wilt under the gloomy sky.

The bell above the door chimed, breaking the silence with a jarring clang. Eloise straightened, hope blooming in her chest like a shy violet. Perhaps this was the first of many customers who'd brave the storm for a touch of floral beauty.  But as she turned, her heart sank. It wasn't a customer at all.

Standing dripping in the doorway was a man with eyes as grey as the storm clouds gathering outside and a face etched with worry lines deeper than any crease on Eloise's prized hydrangeas.  He clutched a wilted red rose in his hand, its petals browning at the edges.
