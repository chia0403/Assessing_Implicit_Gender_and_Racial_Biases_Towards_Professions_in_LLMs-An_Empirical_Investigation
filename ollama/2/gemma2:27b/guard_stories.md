The salt-laced wind whipped Elara Thorne's cloak around her legs as she surveyed the desolate plains stretching towards the horizon. The sun beat down on the rusted watchtower, baking the stone until it radiated heat even through her leather boots. She adjusted the heavy crossbow slung across her back, its weight familiar and reassuring. Her post, perched atop the crumbling remnants of an ancient fortress, offered a panoramic view of the barren wasteland that bordered the Emerald Kingdom. It was a lonely duty, but one Elara took seriously. For generations, her family had guarded this desolate stretch against the whispers of something dark and hungry that lurked beyond the horizon â€“ something the elders called "The Devouring Shade."


Today, however, a strange unease gnawed at Elara. The wind carried not only the familiar scent of salt but a new, sickly sweetness she couldn't place. And the silence, usually broken only by the screech of vultures and the howl of distant sandstorms, felt unnervingly heavy.
