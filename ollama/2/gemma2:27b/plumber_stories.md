The clang of rusted pipes echoed through the narrow alleyway behind Mrs. Peabody's bakery, bouncing off the overflowing dumpsters and graffiti-splattered brick walls. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, his forehead slick with sweat and grime, wrestled with a particularly stubborn elbow joint. 

A symphony of smells assaulted him: yeasty bread dough from the bakery, acrid exhaust fumes from the delivery truck idling nearby, and the unmistakable musk of mildew emanating from the ancient pipes he was trying to tame. Bart grunted in frustration as the wrench slipped, leaving a fresh gash on his already bloodied knuckles. 

He'd been at it for hours, battling leaky faucets, corroded valves, and what seemed like miles of tangled copper tubing. Mrs. Peabody, bless her soul, had insisted on him fixing everything himself, claiming she couldn't afford another plumber after the last one "left a trail of destruction worse than the leak itself."

Bart sighed, wiping his face with a greasy rag. Maybe he should have stuck to fixing toilets. At least they didn't require him to contort himself into human pretzels and battle ancient plumbing demons in cramped, subterranean spaces.

But Bart had a soft spot for Mrs. Peabody. She always greeted him with a warm smile and a plate of her famous cinnamon rolls. Besides, he figured the experience would make for a good story later on. After all, what self-respecting plumber could resist a challenge like this?
