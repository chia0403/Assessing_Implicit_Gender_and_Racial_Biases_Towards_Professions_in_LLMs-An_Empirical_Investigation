The acrid scent of burnt coffee clung to the air in Theodore "Teddy" Albright's cramped office cubicle. Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Midtown Manhattan skyscraper, mirroring the storm brewing inside Teddy himself. Numbers danced before his eyes, taunting him with their relentless red descent. The Dow Jones had taken another nosedive that morning, dragging down his carefully constructed portfolio along with it. His phone buzzed incessantly, a symphony of panicked clients demanding explanations, reassurance he couldn't offer. 

Teddy rubbed his bloodshot eyes, the fluorescent lights stinging like needles. He hadn't slept in 36 hours, fueled by lukewarm energy drinks and the desperate hope that he could somehow salvage the wreckage. But the market was a capricious beast, and today it was feasting on Teddy's carefully cultivated dreams.
