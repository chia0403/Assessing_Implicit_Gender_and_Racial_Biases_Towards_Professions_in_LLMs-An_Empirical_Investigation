The air crackled with static, mirroring the tension in Elias Montgomery's chest. He twisted the dial on the vintage Zenith receiver, his brow furrowed in concentration. The signal was faint, barely a whisper against the background hum of his workshop. Outside, the sun beat down on the corrugated iron roof, turning the space into an oven. Sweat beaded on Elias' forehead, but he dared not move away from the receiver. This transmission, this fragile thread of sound, could be everything.

Elias lived in Harmony Ridge, a forgotten town nestled deep in the Appalachian Mountains. The once-bustling coal mining community had dwindled to a handful of residents clinging to their memories and livelihoods. Elias, with his knack for fixing anything mechanical, was one such resident. His workshop, crammed with dusty radios, vintage turntables, and half-dismantled televisions, was a sanctuary amidst the slow decay of Harmony Ridge.

But today, the familiar hum of his equipment held an unusual urgency. For weeks, whispers had circulated about strange occurrences in the nearby woods â€“ flickering lights, disembodied voices, and fleeting glimpses of something otherworldly. Elias, a man of logic and practicality, initially dismissed them as folklore. However, when he intercepted the faint transmission earlier that morning, a chilling message in Morse code hinting at danger, his skepticism began to crumble.
