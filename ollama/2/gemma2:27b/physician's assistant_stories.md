The humid air clung to Amelia Cartwright like a second skin as she trudged through the bustling marketplace. Stalls overflowed with vibrant spices, glistening fish, and bolts of intricately woven fabric. The cacophony of bartering merchants, bleating goats, and children's laughter swirled around her, a sensory overload after the sterile quiet of the clinic where she worked. 

Amelia wasn't used to this kind of chaos. As a physician assistant in the remote mountain village of San Cristobal, nestled deep within the heart of Guatemala, she spent most of her days tending to the needs of the villagers – treating everything from infected wounds and malarial fever to setting broken bones and delivering babies.

But today was different. A rare opportunity had arisen: a traveling merchant promised to deliver news and supplies from the outside world. Amelia clutched a worn letter in her hand, addressed to "Dr. Cartwright", a title she'd earned through years of relentless study and dedication, even though it wasn't technically hers. 


She needed this delivery. It held a message that could change everything for her – and for San Cristobal.
