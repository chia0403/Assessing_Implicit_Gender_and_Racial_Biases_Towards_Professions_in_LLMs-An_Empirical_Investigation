The air hung thick with pine needles and damp earth, the smell so familiar to Caleb Blackwood it was practically part of his DNA. He wiped sweat from his brow, the coarse fabric of his flannel shirt clinging uncomfortably in the rising heat. Sunlight sliced through the towering Douglas firs, painting fleeting patches of warmth on the forest floor. Around him, the groan of ancient trees yielding to his chainsaw echoed through the silent giants.

Caleb was a fourth-generation logger, his lineage etched into the very wood he felled. He knew these forests like the back of his hand, could read the whispers in the wind and the stories etched onto the bark of every tree. Today, though, a prickling unease crawled beneath his skin. The usual symphony of birdsong was muted, replaced by an unsettling stillness. Even the squirrels, normally scampering amongst the branches, seemed to have vanished. 

He paused, chainsaw idling, listening intently for any sign of disturbance. The only sound was the rhythmic drip of sap from a freshly cut stump, each drop echoing like a hammer blow in the sudden silence. Caleb frowned, his gut churning with an instinct he couldn't ignore. Something wasn't right.
