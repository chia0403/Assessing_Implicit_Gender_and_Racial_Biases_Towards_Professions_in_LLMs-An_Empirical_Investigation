The flickering fluorescent lights buzzed like agitated wasps, casting long, skeletal shadows across the deserted library floor. Dust motes danced in the stale air, illuminated by a lone shaft of moonlight piercing through a grimy windowpane. Archibald "Archie" Finch hummed a jaunty tune as he pushed his battered cleaning cart down the aisle, the squeak of its wheels echoing through the cavernous silence. 

The Grand Blackwood Library, with its towering oak shelves groaning under the weight of centuries-old tomes and its ornate stained glass windows depicting scenes from forgotten mythology, was Archie's domain after hours. He knew every creak in the floorboards, every whisper of wind rustling the ancient pages, every secret nook where dust bunnies gathered undisturbed. 


Tonight, however, something felt different. An unsettling stillness hung in the air, heavier than usual. A shiver snaked down Archie's spine as he rounded a corner and saw a single book lying open on a table, its pages illuminated by an ethereal glow. The book was ancient, bound in cracked leather with strange symbols etched into its cover.
