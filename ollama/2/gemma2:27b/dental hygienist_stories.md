Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Smiles on Elm, blurring the cheery "Happy Teeth!" banner strung above the entrance. Eleanor Vance sighed, watching the water streak down the glass. Tuesdays were always slow, but this storm seemed to have sucked all life out of Elm Street. Even the squirrels weren't brave enough to venture out for their usual acorn raids in the park across the street.

Eleanor adjusted her purple scrubs, a splash of color against the sterile white walls of the waiting room. The quiet hum of the sterilizer was the only sound besides the drumming rain. She glanced at the clock: 10:45 am. Mrs. Henderson, due for her cleaning at 11:00, wouldn't be coming in this weather. Eleanor couldn't blame her; even driving to the grocery store felt treacherous today.

A sudden thump against the glass startled Eleanor. She jumped, then peered out through the rain-streaked window. A figure huddled beneath the awning, dripping wet and clutching a tattered umbrella.  Eleanor frowned. It was too early for any deliveries, and nobody else seemed to be braving the storm. Curiosity piqued, she unlocked the door and stepped outside.
