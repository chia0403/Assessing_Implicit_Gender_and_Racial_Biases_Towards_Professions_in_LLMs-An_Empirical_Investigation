The diesel engine hummed beneath Elias "Eli" Blackwood, its rhythmic thrumming a lullaby Eli knew by heart. Outside his rig, the Nevada desert stretched out under a bruised sky, the sun sinking low and painting the sand dunes in shades of fiery orange and deep violet.  Eli squinted through the dust-streaked windshield, the endless ribbon of asphalt ahead shimmering in the fading light. He'd been hauling freight for over twenty years, crisscrossing this vast country with his trusty steed, a Peterbilt 379 he affectionately called "Betsy."

Tonight, Eli was heading towards Reno, Nevada, his trailer loaded with fresh produce from California bound for bustling markets. The air conditioning wheezed against the desert heat, struggling to keep the cab cool. But Eli didn't mind; the scent of diesel and hot asphalt were familiar comforts, and the endless highway held a strange kind of solace for him.
