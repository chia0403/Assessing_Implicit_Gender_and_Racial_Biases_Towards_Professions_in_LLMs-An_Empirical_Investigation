The greasy scent of engine oil and hot metal hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort to Elias "Eli" Blackwood. His calloused hands, perpetually stained with grime, danced over the exposed engine of a 1967 Mustang, diagnosing its sputtering cough with an intuitive ease honed over decades.  

Eli's garage, "Blackwood's Bolts & Gears," sat nestled in the heart of Harmony Springs, a sleepy town where time seemed to move at a slower pace. Brick buildings, weathered by years and peppered with ivy, lined Main Street, their storefronts showcasing faded signs advertising everything from antique furniture to homemade pies. The rhythmic clang of Eli's tools mingled with the distant chirping of crickets and the occasional rumble of a passing truck, creating a symphony unique to this forgotten corner of America.

Today, however, the usual tranquility was shattered by an unexpected visitor - a sleek black sedan that looked decidedly out of place amidst the vintage automobiles dotting Eli's lot.  A woman emerged from the car, her silhouette sharp against the fading afternoon light. She carried herself with an air of quiet confidence, her emerald green eyes scanning the garage with an intensity that made Eli instinctively straighten his grease-stained overalls.
