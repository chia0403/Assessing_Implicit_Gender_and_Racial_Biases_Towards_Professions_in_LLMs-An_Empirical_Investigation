Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the abandoned warehouse, each drop echoing like a drumbeat in the cavernous space. Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, his calloused fingers wrapped around a sputtering flashlight, squinted into the gloom. The air hung heavy with the scent of mildew and decay, punctuated by the occasional screech of a rusty pipe protesting against its stillness.  He'd been called here by Old Man Withers, who swore up and down that something was amiss with the wiring in his "vintage" Tesla coil. Bart wasn't sure what he expected to find - a nest of rats gnawing on live wires, perhaps? Or maybe Withers had finally lost it, his mind succumbing to the electrifying solitude of this derelict building. Either way, Bart needed the work, and besides, who could resist the siren call of a malfunctioning Tesla coil?

Bart took a cautious step forward, the floorboards groaning under his weight. Cobwebs clung to his face like ghostly fingers as he navigated the labyrinthine interior. The only sound was the relentless drumming of the rain and the faint hum emanating from somewhere deep within the building. He pulled out his multimeter, its digital display flickering ominously in the dim light.  Something wasn't right here.  The air crackled with unseen energy, sending shivers down Bart's spine. This wasn't just a faulty wire. There was something else at play, something...unnatural.
