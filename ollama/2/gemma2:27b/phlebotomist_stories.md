The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the worn linoleum floor of Mercy General Hospital's lab. The air, thick with the metallic tang of antiseptic and the faint whisper of hushed conversations, felt heavy in her lungs. Eloise sighed, adjusting the thin plastic gloves on her hands. It was 3:47 PM, a time when the hospital shifted from the frenzied rush of afternoon admissions to the quieter lull before dinner.

She glanced at the stack of requisition forms on her desk - a rainbow of colors signifying different departments and tests. Each one represented a patient, a life story waiting to be unfolded within the crimson tide of their blood. Eloise had always found a strange comfort in this ritual, in the precise extraction of life force, the delicate dance of needles and veins. Today, however, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.

The last requisition form on the stack bore a name that sent a shiver down her spine: "Jonathan Blackwood."  A patient she knew, one whose case had been whispered about in hushed tones throughout the hospital hallways for weeks. Eloise took a deep breath, reminding herself to remain professional.
