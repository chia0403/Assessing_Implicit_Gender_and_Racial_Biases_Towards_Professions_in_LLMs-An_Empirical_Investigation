Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunnyside Daycare, blurring the vibrant crayon drawings taped haphazardly onto the glass. Inside, Amelia Cartwright hummed along to the tinny rendition of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" playing on the old boombox in the corner. She crouched down beside three-year-old Leo, patiently helping him build a lopsided tower out of mismatched blocks.

The storm outside was relentless, mirroring the turmoil churning within Amelia's own heart. This wasn't her dream job.  She yearned for something more stimulating, something that allowed her to use the degree in early childhood education she'd worked so hard to earn. But Sunnyside offered steady work, a roof over her head (albeit in a cramped studio apartment above the bakery), and enough leftover to occasionally indulge in her secret passion: writing fantasy novels.

Today, however, even the thought of escaping into her fictional world seemed impossible. A phone call earlier that morning from her estranged mother had left her reeling, dredging up old wounds and unsettling anxieties she'd thought buried deep.
