Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Infirmary, mimicking the relentless pounding in Dr. Eleanor Sinclair's chest. The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across the cramped, wood-paneled room, illuminating rows of dusty medical texts and jars filled with unsettling specimens. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and something else, something metallic and vaguely unsettling. Eleanor pressed a cold compress to her forehead, trying in vain to quell the rising tide of anxiety.  

Tonight was different. Tonight, she wasn't facing a bout of influenza or a broken bone. Tonight, a man lay on the cot before her, his skin ashen, his breath ragged and shallow. He clutched at his chest, muttering incoherent words about shadows and whispers, his eyes wide with a terror that chilled Eleanor to the bone.

This was no ordinary illness. This felt like somethingâ€¦else entirely.
