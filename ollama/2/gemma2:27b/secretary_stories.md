The rhythmic click-clack of Esmeralda "Esme" Hawthorne's typewriter was the only sound in the cavernous office after hours. Moonlight spilled through the grimy window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the mahogany desk. Outside, the city groaned under a blanket of fog, its usual symphony of honks and shouts replaced by an eerie silence. Esme, perched on her swivel chair like a watchful gargoyle, was determined to finish the report before Mr. Thornton's 8 AM arrival.

The air hung heavy with the scent of old paper and stale cigar smoke, a testament to the countless hours spent within these walls. The office itself felt like a relic from a bygone era: high ceilings adorned with ornate moldings, antique furniture polished to a gleam, and shelves groaning under the weight of leather-bound ledgers. But Esme knew appearances could be deceiving; beneath this veneer of elegance lurked a darker truth. Mr. Thornton's empire was built on whispers and shadows, deals struck in smoke-filled backrooms, and secrets buried deep within its labyrinthine corridors.

And tonight, as Esme typed away, she couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. A chill snaked down her spine, an unnerving premonition whispering of danger lurking just beyond the veil of moonlight.
