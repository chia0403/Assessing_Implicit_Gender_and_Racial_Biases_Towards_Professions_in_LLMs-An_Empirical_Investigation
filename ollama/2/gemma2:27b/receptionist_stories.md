The insistent chime of the doorbell echoed through the cavernous lobby, jolting Elara Blackwood back to reality. She'd been drifting off again, lulled by the monotonous tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner and the stale scent of dust and forgotten dreams that permeated The Obsidian Tower. 

From her vantage point behind the mahogany reception desk, polished to a mirror shine yet perpetually coated in a thin layer of fingerprints, she could see the silhouette of the newcomer through the frosted glass panels of the double doors. Tall, broad-shouldered, shrouded in shadow.  Elara straightened her posture, smoothed the wrinkles from her crisp white blouse, and plastered on her most professional smile.

This was The Obsidian Tower, after all, a place where whispers clung to the ornate tapestry-covered walls and secrets simmered beneath the polished surface of everything. Elara knew better than anyone that appearances mattered.
