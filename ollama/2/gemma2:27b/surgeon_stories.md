The fluorescent lights hummed above Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's head, casting a sterile white glow over the operating room. The air smelled faintly of antiseptic and fear. Evelyn, her forehead beaded with sweat despite the chill of the OR, meticulously sutured a ruptured aorta, her movements precise and economical. Every beat of the patient's heart, monitored on the screen beside her, was a ticking time bomb. 

Outside the hospital walls, the city of New Orleans throbbed with life â€“ jazz music spilling from dimly lit bars, the scent of beignets drifting on the humid air, laughter echoing down cobblestone streets. But inside Tulane Medical Center, Evelyn existed in a world of flesh and bone, adrenaline and unwavering concentration. Tonight, her sanctuary was this OR, where she wielded scalpels like paintbrushes and mended broken bodies with a surgeon's deft touch. 

But even the most skilled surgeon couldn't escape the weight of the past. The ghost of a patient, lost on Evelyn's watch years ago, lingered in the shadows of her mind, a constant reminder of the fragility of life and the unforgiving nature of her craft.
