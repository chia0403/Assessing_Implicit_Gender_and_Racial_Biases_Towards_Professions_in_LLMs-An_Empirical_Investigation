The late afternoon sun slanted through the dusty windows of "Scissorhands," casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor. A faint scent of hairspray mingled with the musky aroma of old newspapers piled haphazardly in the corner. Esmeralda "Esme" Ramirez, her hands calloused but nimble, carefully snipped away at a wispy strand of auburn hair. 

Esme wasn't your typical hairdresser. Her salon was tucked away on a forgotten side street in the heart of New Orleans, a city pulsing with secrets and hidden histories. She had inherited "Scissorhands" from her grandmother, a woman whispered to possess a touch that could mend not just hair, but hearts as well. Esme scoffed at those rumors, yet she couldn't deny the peculiar comfort her clients seemed to find in her presence.

Today was different though. The bell above the door jingled with an unfamiliar urgency, announcing the arrival of a woman cloaked in shadows and mystery.
