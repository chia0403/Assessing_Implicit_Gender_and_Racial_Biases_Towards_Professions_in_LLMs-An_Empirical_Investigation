The flickering neon sign outside cast an anemic green glow onto the rain-slicked street. "The Siren's Call," it proclaimed in swirling script, promising something alluring but ultimately hollow. Inside, Elias Thorne polished a chipped highball glass with practiced movements, his reflection wavering in the mahogany surface. The air hung thick with the mingled scents of stale beer, spilled whiskey, and regret - the quintessential aroma of The Siren's Call.

Elias had been tending bar here for longer than he cared to remember, pouring solace into the bottomless pits of strangers and listening to their woes with a stoic silence. He was a master of mixing drinks and masking emotions, his weathered face betraying nothing of the turmoil brewing beneath the surface. Tonight, however, felt different. A palpable tension crackled in the air, electrifying the usual humdrum. The storm raging outside seemed to mirror the unease he felt within, a premonition whispering of something sinister on the horizon.
