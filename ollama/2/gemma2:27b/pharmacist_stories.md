Rain lashed against the stained-glass windows of St. Sybil's Apothecary, each drop exploding into a thousand shimmering prisms across the worn oak floorboards. Eleanor Thorne adjusted her spectacles, the faint scent of lavender and chamomile momentarily battling the earthy smell of damp stone that permeated the ancient building. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Oakhaven were deserted, swallowed by the swirling grey mist.

Eleanor sighed, idly tracing a finger along the spines of dusty tomes lining the shelves. Business had been slow ever since the "modern" pharmacy opened across the street, its neon sign a garish beacon in the otherwise quaint town square. While Eleanor prided herself on her traditional methods and personalized service – grinding herbs by hand, concocting poultices from ancient recipes, whispering incantations to imbue them with extra potency – many seemed content with the quick fixes offered by mass-produced pills. 

But tonight, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced at the nape of her neck. The bell above the door chimed, breaking the silence with a jarring clang. Eleanor turned, expecting to see the usual late-night customer – Mrs. Hawthorne and her persistent cough – but instead, found herself staring into the shadowed face of a stranger.
