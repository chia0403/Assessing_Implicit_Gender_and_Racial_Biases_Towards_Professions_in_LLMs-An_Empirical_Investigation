The humid Charleston air clung to Beatrice "Bea" Montgomery like a damp shawl as she trudged up the porch steps of the grand old Victorian. Built in 1892, the house sagged with age, its peeling paint and overgrown azaleas whispering tales of forgotten grandeur. Bea straightened her floral sundress, tucking a stray curl behind her ear. This listing was crucial - a potential break-through deal for her fledgling real estate career. The previous agent had given up, deeming the property "too much trouble," but Bea saw something else: potential. Beneath the layers of neglect and dust lay the bones of a magnificent home, waiting to be resurrected. 

Taking a deep breath, she reached for the tarnished brass knocker shaped like a snarling griffin, its beak chipped and missing an eye. This house, with its secrets and shadows, was begging for a story. And Bea, ever the adventurer at heart, was ready to uncover it.
