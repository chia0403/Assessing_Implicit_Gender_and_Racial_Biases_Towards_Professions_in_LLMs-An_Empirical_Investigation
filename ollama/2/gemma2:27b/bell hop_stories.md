The Grand Blackwood Hotel loomed over Elm Street like a gothic monolith, its gargoyle-studded facade casting long, skeletal shadows in the fading afternoon light. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of polished mahogany and stale cigar smoke, punctuated by the occasional burst of floral perfume from a departing guest. This was Theodore Alistair Finch's domain. Not that anyone outside the cramped bell hop's quarters on the basement floor knew his name. He was simply "Bellhop," a nameless cog in the opulent machinery of the Grand Blackwood, perpetually clad in his navy blue uniform and eternally resigned to the whims of demanding travelers.

Today, however, something felt different. A nervous flutter vibrated beneath Theo's starched collar as he waited by the revolving door. An airship, sleek and silver against the bruised sky, was descending onto the rooftop landing pad. The passengers were rumored to be important, perhaps even royalty. Theo straightened his cap, hoping this wouldn't be another day of lugging overstuffed trunks and enduring condescending glares. 

He longed for something more, a glimpse beyond the gilded cage of the Grand Blackwood, but duty bound him to the carousel of arrivals and departures. As the airship doors hissed open, revealing a figure draped in shimmering emerald silk, Theo knew this wouldn't be an ordinary arrival.
