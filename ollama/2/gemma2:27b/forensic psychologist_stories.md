Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes of the interrogation room, mimicking the storm brewing inside Dr. Evelyn Albright. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an unsettling pallor on the man sitting across from her â€“  a gaunt figure with eyes as hollow as the rusted pipes in the building's aging infrastructure. This wasn't just another case for Evelyn; it was personal. The suspect, Marcus Thorne, had been accused of a crime eerily similar to one that had haunted her family for years, an unsolved disappearance that left gaping holes in her childhood and fueled her desire to understand the darkest corners of the human psyche.

The air hung heavy with tension as Evelyn leaned forward, her gaze unwavering. She knew Thorne was a master manipulator, playing on vulnerabilities and twisting truths. But Evelyn wouldn't be swayed. This time, she wouldn't let history repeat itself.  This time, she would find the answers she craved, even if it meant staring into the abyss.
