Rain lashed against the windows of The Lighthouse, blurring the already hazy outline of the rugged Cornish coastline beyond. Amelia Cartwright, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, sighed as she surveyed the scene. It wasn't the tempestuous weather that bothered her, though it certainly added to the melancholic atmosphere. It was the empty chair opposite her. 

Amelia, a dedicated occupational therapist specializing in neurological rehabilitation, had been eagerly anticipating her new patient.  Mr. Silas Trelawney, a retired fisherman renowned for his tales of daring escapades on the stormy seas, had suffered a stroke leaving him with debilitating weakness on his right side. Amelia was determined to help Silas regain his independence and, perhaps, even share some of those captivating stories herself.

But today, the lighthouse keeper's daughter, a wisp of a girl named Elara, had arrived with news that Mr. Trelawney wasn't well enough for their session.  A fresh wave of disappointment crashed over Amelia. She longed to make a difference in Silas' life, to see his gruff exterior melt away as he rediscovered the joy of simple tasks â€“ tying his shoelaces, stirring a cup of tea, casting a fishing line. The empty chair mocked her ambition.
