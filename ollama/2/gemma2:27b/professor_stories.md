The acrid smell of woodsmoke stung Professor Eleanor Ainsworth's nostrils as she pushed open the heavy oak door. A plume of grey smoke snaked through the frigid air, momentarily obscuring the ramshackle wooden cabin perched precariously on the cliff edge. Beyond the cabin, the wind whipped the icy waves of the North Sea into a frenzy, their whitecaps spitting against the craggy rocks below. Eleanor shivered, pulling her tweed coat tighter around her as she stepped inside.

The interior was dimly lit by a flickering hearth fire, casting long shadows across the cluttered space. Dusty books lined the walls, overflowing onto haphazardly stacked tables. Strange artifacts – bones, shells, weathered maps – were scattered amidst piles of parchment and notebooks. A figure hunched over a workbench in the corner, his back towards her. This must be Silas Blackwood, Eleanor thought, the reclusive scholar who held the key to unlocking the secrets of the ancient Norse legends she'd dedicated her life to studying.
