Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the neon glow of the "Fresh Start Nutrition" sign hanging precariously above Amelia Rose Cartwright's cramped office.  The aroma of stale coffee mingled with the faint scent of artificial lemon cleaner, a familiar olfactory cocktail in this part of town. Amelia sighed, pushing away a stack of client files that threatened to avalanche onto her overflowing desk. It was barely 8am, and already the day felt as grey and oppressive as the weather outside.

She'd chosen this location – nestled between a pawn shop and a laundromat on the edge of Elmwood – with hopes of bringing healthy eating habits to an underserved community. But six months in, she felt more like a lone lighthouse keeper battling against a storm of processed food and misinformation.
