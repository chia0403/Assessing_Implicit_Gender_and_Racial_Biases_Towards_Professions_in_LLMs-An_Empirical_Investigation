Rain lashed against the windowpane of "Curl Up & Dye," blurring the neon pink sign into a watercolour smear. Inside, Emilia Rose Beaumont fussed with a rogue strand of fuchsia hairspray that had escaped its intended destination â€“ a towering beehive perched precariously on Mrs. Higgins' head.

Emilia sighed, her reflection in the salon mirror mirroring her frustration.  The dreary November weather matched her mood perfectly. Business was slow, the usual Saturday morning buzz replaced by a disconcerting silence punctuated only by the rhythmic dripping of a leaky faucet behind the styling chairs.  

It wasn't just the rain keeping customers away. The arrival of "Hair Haven," a sleek new salon two blocks down boasting celebrity stylists and organic avocado treatments, had thrown Emilia's world into turmoil. Her once-loyal clientele were starting to drift away, lured by promises of Instagram-worthy transformations. 



Emilia needed a miracle, and fast.
