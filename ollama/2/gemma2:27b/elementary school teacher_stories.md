Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Ms. Eleanor "Ellie" Ainsworth's third-grade classroom, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves swirling outside into a watercolour mess. The rhythmic drumming on the glasspane was punctuated by the occasional shriek of wind whistling through the old oak tree that stood sentinel by the playground. Ellie sighed, pushing a stray lock of auburn hair behind her ear as she surveyed the scene.

Crayons lay scattered across desks like fallen soldiers, and half-finished art projects depicting grinning pumpkins and lumpy turkeys adorned the walls. The scent of glue and stale crayons hung heavy in the air, mingled with the faint aroma of damp wool from Ms. Ainsworth's cardigan. A shiver ran down her spine despite the warmth radiating from the ancient radiator beneath the window. 

It was a day like any other in Maple Creek Elementary, except for one thing: the unsettling feeling that something wasn't quite right.
