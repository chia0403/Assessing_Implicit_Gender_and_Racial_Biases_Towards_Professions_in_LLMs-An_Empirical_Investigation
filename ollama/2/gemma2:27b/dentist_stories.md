Rain lashed against the warped windowpane of Dr. Silas Blackwood's office, mimicking the insistent throb in his own temple. The ancient oak tree outside, its branches gnarled like arthritic fingers, swayed precariously, casting grotesque shadows that danced across the faded floral wallpaper.

Silas sighed, rubbing weary eyes beneath his spectacles. His small dental practice, nestled on a forgotten side street in the crumbling Victorian quarter of Grimsborough, was as desolate as the storm raging outside. He hadn't had a single patient all day, which wasn't entirely unusual for a Tuesday, but today the silence felt particularly oppressive. 


He glanced at the clock – 4:17 pm. With another hour before closing time, he contemplated escaping the dreary atmosphere and venturing out for a pint at The Crooked Tooth, a dimly lit pub favoured by his fellow Grimsborough residents. But something held him back, a prickle of unease that had been gnawing at him since morning. It was as though the storm itself carried an ominous weight, a sense of impending doom.

And then, just as Silas dismissed it as morbid imagination fuelled by loneliness and bad weather, the doorbell rang – sharp, insistent, like a summons he couldn't ignore.
