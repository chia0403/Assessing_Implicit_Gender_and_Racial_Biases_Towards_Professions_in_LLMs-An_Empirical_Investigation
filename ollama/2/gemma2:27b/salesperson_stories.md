Rain hammered against the grimy windshield, blurring the neon signs of Times Square into streaks of pink and green. Amelia "Amy" Chen grimaced, tugging her threadbare trench coat tighter around herself.  The air hung heavy with the scent of damp asphalt and hot dogs, a peculiar perfume unique to New York City. Amy hated the rain, it always seemed to dampen more than just her clothes. It drenched her spirit, making every sale feel like an uphill battle.

Tonight was no different. She'd been pounding the pavement for hours, her briefcase overflowing with brochures for "Miracle Clean," a new-fangled cleaning product promising to banish stains with the power of "bio-activated enzymes." Amy knew it was just glorified soap, but she needed this job. Rent was due, and ramen noodles were getting old.

She trudged towards a brightly lit diner, its windows fogged with steam. Maybe a cup of coffee could revive her flagging spirits. As she pushed open the door, a gust of warm air washed over her, carrying the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and sizzling bacon.
