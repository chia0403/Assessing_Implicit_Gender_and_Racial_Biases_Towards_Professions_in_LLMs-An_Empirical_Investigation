The acrid smell of burnt coffee clung to the air in Bartholomew "Bart" Quinlan's cramped office like a stubborn stain. Outside, the relentless Miami sun beat down on the faded pastel facades of Little Havana, turning the world into a shimmering mirage. Bart slumped back in his chair, his tie loosened and sweat beading on his forehead. A stack of insurance claims loomed before him, each one a testament to life's unexpected twists and turns â€“ car accidents, flooded basements, stolen bicycles.

Today, however, Bart was facing a claim unlike any he'd seen before. The file on his desk detailed the disappearance of Mrs. Esmeralda Rodriguez's prized parrot, Coco, last seen perched on her balcony railing just before a sudden thunderstorm. While Bart understood the emotional significance of losing a pet, he couldn't help but feel this claim was pushing the boundaries of insurance legitimacy.

"A talking parrot?" Bart muttered to himself, running a hand through his thinning hair. "This is going to be interesting."
