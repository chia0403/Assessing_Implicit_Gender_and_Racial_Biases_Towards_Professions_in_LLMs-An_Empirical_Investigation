Rain lashed against the windows of Elsie Beatrice Winthrop's home office, mirroring the storm brewing inside her. Tax season was upon them, that annual leviathan threatening to devour every waking moment for the next three months. Stacks of W-2s and 1099s loomed on her desk like precarious towers, each form representing another frantic soul seeking Elsie's help navigating the labyrinthine world of income taxes.

Elsie sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear. Her office, nestled in the attic of her Victorian home, was cozy yet chaotic. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the rain-streaked windows, casting long shadows across the worn wooden floor and overflowing bookshelves. The scent of chamomile tea, brewing perpetually in her antique teapot, battled with the musty aroma of aged paper for dominance. Elsie loved this space, its comforting clutter a reflection of her own mind: organized chaos, full of hidden pathways leading to unexpected solutions. But today, even the familiar comfort couldn't quell the rising tide of anxiety.
