The air hung heavy with the scent of granite dust and sweat, clinging to Silas Blackwood like a second skin. His calloused hands gripped the chisel, knuckles stark white against the polished wood handle. Sunlight, fractured by the dusty panes of his workshop window, danced across the rough surface of the stone he was working. 

Silasâ€™s workshop nestled into the hillside overlooking the bustling port town of Port Haven. Waves crashed rhythmically against the rocky shore below, their sound a constant backdrop to the clang and scrape of Silas's tools.  The stone before him, a hefty block of pale grey granite, was destined to become the lintel for the new apothecary being built down by the harbor.

He squinted, his brow furrowed in concentration as he carefully tapped the chisel against the stone. Each strike sent vibrations up his arms, resonating in the marrow of his bones. Silas loved the feel of stone yielding beneath his touch, transforming from a shapeless mass into something beautiful and functional.
