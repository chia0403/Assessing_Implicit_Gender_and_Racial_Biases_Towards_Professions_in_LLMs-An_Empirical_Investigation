The midday sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's weathered neck as he balanced precariously on the steep pitch of the Victorian mansion.  Slate tiles, worn smooth by decades of rain and wind, shifted beneath his boots. Below him, the manicured lawns of Oakhaven stretched out like a verdant carpet, dotted with the pastel-colored houses of the affluent. Silas, however, was far removed from their world of afternoon tea parties and croquet matches. He belonged to the realm above, where the air thrummed with the cries of hawks circling overhead and the wind whistled through the eaves like an ancient mariner's song.

Today's job was a doozy - replacing the entire roof on this grand old dame, a task that would take him weeks to complete. Silas didn't mind the solitude. It allowed him time to think, to let his mind wander among the clouds as he hammered away at the rusty nails holding down the ancient slate. Up here, amongst the sparrows and the chimney swifts, he felt truly free.
