The air was thick with the scent of duty-free perfume and stale coffee as Amelia "Amy" Celeste adjusted her smile for the hundredth time.  

She stood in the aisle of Flight 317, a Boeing 777 bound for Tokyo from LAX, navigating the pre-takeoff chaos with practiced ease. Luggage was being stowed, last-minute announcements blared, and toddlers shrieked with a mix of excitement and fear. Amy could practically feel the collective energy of anticipation pulsing through the cabin, a symphony of fidgeting legs, hushed conversations, and rustling newspapers.

Her gaze swept across the passengers, each a vignette of human life on pause: a young couple whispering sweet nothings, a businessman hunched over his laptop with furrowed brows, an elderly woman clutching a tattered travel journal, her eyes brimming with a faraway longing.

Amy took a deep breath, trying to block out the hum of anxiety that always thrummed beneath the surface when planes were about to take off. This flight was different, though. A prickle of unease danced on the edge of her awareness, a feeling she couldn't quite place.  Maybe it was the man in seat 23B, his eyes shadowed and gaze fixed on something unseen beyond the window. Or perhaps it was the unsettling silence emanating from the back of the plane, where a group of passengers sat huddled together, their faces pale and drawn.


Whatever the reason, Amy knew this journey wouldn't be your average transpacific flight. It felt like the beginning of something...unusual.
