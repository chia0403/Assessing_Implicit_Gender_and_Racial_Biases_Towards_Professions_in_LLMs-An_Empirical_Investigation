The aroma of simmering rosemary and garlic hung heavy in the air, mingling with the salty tang of the sea breeze that constantly whispered through the open kitchen window.  Inside "The Driftwood Diner," Amelia Rose Thornton was knee-deep in flour, her apron dusted white like fresh snowfall. 

Outside, on the weathered wooden pier stretching out into the choppy turquoise waters of Cape Cod Bay, fishermen hauled in their nets, their gruff laughter echoing across the harbor. It was a Monday morning, slow season on the cape, and Amelia had the diner mostly to herself.  Except for old man Finnigan, perched at his usual corner booth, sipping coffee and watching her with that knowing twinkle in his eye that hinted heâ€™d seen it all - from runaway brides to lost lovers to kitchen fires that rivaled the July 4th fireworks display.

Amelia hummed a tuneless melody as she kneaded the dough for her famous lobster rolls, the recipe passed down from her grandmother, a woman who knew more about the sea than any man on the cape. It was in Amelia's blood, this connection to the ocean and the stories it held.  She could almost taste the salt spray in each bite of bread, smell the seaweed clinging to the lobster shells. This wasn't just food; it was a legacy. And Amelia Rose Thornton, with her flour-dusted apron and heart full of Cape Cod magic, was determined to keep it alive.
