The rhythmic click-clack of Ava Rosalind Harper's shoes echoed through the sterile hallway as she approached Room 3B. The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and lingering anxiety. Sunshine streamed through the high windows at the end of the corridor, painting a stark contrast to the shadows clinging to the corners. Outside, bustling city life pulsed, oblivious to the quiet battles being waged within these four walls. Ava stopped outside the room, taking a deep breath before pushing the door open. 

Her patient, Mr. Daniel Evans, sat hunched on the edge of the bed, his gaze fixed on the floor. A sling draped across his left arm, it was evidence of the fall that had brought him here, leaving him with a broken clavicle and shattered spirits. Ava knew from experience that the physical recovery was only half the battle. The mental wounds often took longer to heal.

This wasn't just another rehabilitation session for Ava; this was an opportunity to mend not just muscles and bones, but also a man's faith in himself.
