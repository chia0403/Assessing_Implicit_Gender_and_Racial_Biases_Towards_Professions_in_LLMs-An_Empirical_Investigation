The wind howled like a banshee outside the cramped shack, rattling the windows of Station K3G2 with each gust.  Inside, Silas Blackwood, his calloused fingers deftly weaving through wires, squinted at the oscilloscope in front of him. Static crackled through the speakers, punctuated by bursts of garbled audio that sounded suspiciously like someone trying to speak underwater. 

Silas, a man whose weathered face bore witness to years spent wrestling with the capricious nature of radio waves, sighed. He was perched precariously on a stool next to his workbench, surrounded by an eclectic assortment of tools, spare parts, and maps pinned haphazardly to the wall.
