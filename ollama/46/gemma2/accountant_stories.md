The fluorescent lights hummed above Eleanor Thistlewick's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the spreadsheets spread across her desk like a battlefield of numbers. Rain lashed against the windows of her tiny office, blurring the cityscape into an impressionist canvas of grey and green. A wind whistled through a gap in the window frame, sending shivers down her spine despite the oppressive warmth of the cramped room. 

Eleanor, hunched over a particularly complex set of accounts for "Fancy Furs Ltd," rubbed her tired eyes.  Her reflection in the computer screen stared back, framed by unruly auburn hair and dark circles that spoke volumes about her recent sleep deprivation. She'd been working overtime for weeks, trying to meet the impossible deadlines set by her demanding boss, Mr. Bartholomew. 


He was a man who believed numbers held the secrets of the universe, and Eleanor, his dedicated (if slightly beleaguered) underling, was tasked with deciphering them.  This particular set of accounts, however, felt different. There was something…off about them. A misplaced decimal here, an unexplained discrepancy there – small things that gnawed at her like a persistent itch. Perhaps it was just fatigue playing tricks on her, but Eleanor couldn't shake the feeling that she was on the verge of uncovering something far more sinister than a simple accounting error.
