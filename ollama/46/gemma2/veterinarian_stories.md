The rusted swing set creaked rhythmically in the wind, its rusty chains singing a mournful tune that echoed Dr. Evelyn Thorne's mood. It was always quiet like this at the edge of town, just her and the endless wheat fields stretching to the horizon. The only other sound was the rhythmic rasp of cicadas humming their summer symphony. 

Evelyn sighed, pushing her spectacles further up her nose and adjusting the worn leather satchel slung across her shoulder. Today was supposed to be a day for paperwork, a rare reprieve from tending to sick animals.  But the call had come in earlier, a frantic voice begging for help with a stray dog found tangled in barbed wire. It wasn't unusual for people to turn to Evelyn, their last resort after hours and miles separating them from any other vet.  

Her small clinic, nestled between a dusty general store and a boarded-up diner, was more than just a place of healing; it was the heart of this forgotten corner of Wyoming.
