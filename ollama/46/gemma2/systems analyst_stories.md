The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Harper's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of identical desks. Outside, Seattle buzzed with the usual pre-rain energy, a symphony of honking horns and rumbling buses, but inside the tech giant's headquarters, it was a different kind of storm brewing. 

Amelia, a systems analyst whose meticulous mind dissected complex code like a surgeon wielding scalpels, felt the tension in the air thicker than the stale coffee she sipped from her travel mug.  The recent security breach had rattled the company to its core, and whispers of "impossible hack" and "insider threat" were swirling faster than the server fans whirring in the background. 

Amelia wasn't one for office drama, but this was different. It felt personal. Her code, her algorithms, the very systems she'd poured countless hours into building, had been compromised. A shiver ran down her spine. This wasn't just a technical challenge; it was a puzzle with a human face, and Amelia was determined to find that face. 


The setting is a sterile, high-tech office within a sprawling tech company headquarters in Seattle, Washington.
