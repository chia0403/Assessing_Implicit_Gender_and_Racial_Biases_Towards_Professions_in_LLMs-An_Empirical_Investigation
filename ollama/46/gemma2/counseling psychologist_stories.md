Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Vance's office, each drop like a tiny hammer blow on the glass. The wind howled outside, mimicking the turmoil brewing inside her current patient, Ms. Amelia Thorne.  Amelia sat hunched in the plush armchair, her shoulders trembling with suppressed sobs.  The air was thick with the scent of lavender essential oil, an attempt by Eleanor to soothe the jagged edges of Amelia's anxiety.

Eleanor’s office was a sanctuary of sorts – bathed in soft, yellow light from a Tiffany-style lamp on her antique desk.  Bookshelves lined the walls, crammed with volumes on psychology, philosophy, and poetry – a testament to Eleanor's belief that understanding the human mind required delving into both reason and emotion. Outside the window, the city of New Orleans hummed with life, oblivious to the storm raging inside Amelia's soul.  But here, in this quiet room, Amelia felt safe enough to let the dam break.
