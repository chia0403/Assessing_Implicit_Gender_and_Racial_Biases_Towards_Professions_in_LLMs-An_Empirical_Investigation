The air in "Fine & Dandy," Amelia Clementine Harper's domain, buzzed with the electric anticipation of the annual Spring Showcase. Sunlight streamed through the enormous bay windows, illuminating rows upon rows of delicate china teacups and shimmering silk scarves, all draped in pristine white cloths like sleeping beauties waiting to be awakened. The scent of freshly brewed jasmine tea mingled with the faint aroma of lavender hand lotion, creating a sensory cocoon designed to lull potential buyers into a state of blissful desire.

Amelia, however, felt anything but blissful. Her perfectly coiffed blonde bob seemed to droop under the weight of her worry. This Showcase was make-or-break for her. If she didn't pull in at least three big sales, her position at "Fine & Dandy" – a dream job since childhood – would be hanging by a thread thinner than the lace adorning the silk blouses displayed on mannequins in the corner.  


Amelia adjusted her crimson lipstick, hoping it conveyed more confidence than she felt. Her emerald eyes scanned the throng of arriving guests, searching for faces that might hold the promise of success.
