The humid Louisiana air clung to Bartholomew “Bart” Landry like a second skin as he surveyed the scene before him. A dilapidated Victorian mansion loomed in the twilight, its once grand facade now marred by peeling paint and overgrown vines.  Bart ran a hand over his grease-stained overalls, feeling the heat radiating from the rusted metal box labelled "Main Electrical Panel" lying on its side in the overgrown garden. This wasn't your typical wiring job - no flickering lights or faulty outlets here. This was an investigation, a descent into the electrical heart of a mystery.  

Bart had been called by Mrs. Evangeline Dubois, the mansion’s current resident and last descendant of its original owner. She claimed strange things were happening – lights dimming inexplicably, appliances malfunctioning at random, even whispers in the dead of night that sounded eerily like static on an old radio. Bart, a pragmatic electrician with more experience troubleshooting burnt fuses than paranormal phenomena,  found himself oddly intrigued. He knew it was just faulty wiring, but there was something about this place, something about Mrs. Dubois's frantic eyes, that made him wonder if there was more to the story than met the eye.
