The morning mist hung low over Willow Creek, clinging to the rows of vibrant geraniums lining Amelia Rose Hawthorne's flower stall like a shy child. The scent of damp earth and dew-kissed petals filled the air, a comforting symphony for Amelia as she began her daily ritual. She surveyed her stock with a practiced eye: plump sunflowers reaching towards the rising sun, blushing roses poised to burst open, and delicate ferns unfurling their emerald fronds.  A sigh escaped her lips, tinged with both contentment and a familiar ache. Another day in paradise, but also another day spent alone, surrounded by beauty that couldn't quite fill the emptiness within. 

Willow Creek, nestled deep in the heart of Oregon’s verdant Willamette Valley, was a picture postcard town: quaint cottages with rose-trimmed gardens, cobblestone streets whispering secrets underfoot, and a community that pulsed with warmth and kindness. Yet, for Amelia, despite the idyllic setting, life felt like a half-written poem –  a melody missing its final note.
