The air thrummed with the bassline of Rihanna's "Work," vibrating through Amelia Beatrice "Amy" Grantâ€™s very bones. Sweat slicked her brow as she expertly navigated a complex series of vinyasas, guiding her class through a sunrise yoga session in the airy loft studio. Sunlight streamed through the expansive windows overlooking the bustling city below, casting warm squares on the colourful mats spread across the polished concrete floor. 

Amy inhaled deeply, savouring the scent of sandalwood incense and fresh laundry detergent that permeated the space. This was her sanctuary, her domain, where she wove together physical strength with mindful awareness, helping others find their own inner harmony. Yet, beneath the surface calm, a knot of anxiety tightened in Amy's chest. 

This month's rent had come due, and with the recent influx of online fitness platforms stealing clientele, business was struggling. The thought of potentially losing her beloved studio loomed over her like a dark cloud, threatening to eclipse the golden light streaming through the windows.
