The air hung thick with smoke, tasting of burnt rubber and something acrid that made Elias “Eli” Thorne’s nostrils burn. He wiped his brow, leaving a streak of soot across his already grime-stained forehead. The warehouse blaze roared behind him, a monstrous beast devouring anything in its path. Flames licked at the sky, painting the cityscape with ominous crimson streaks.

The setting sun cast long shadows on the cracked asphalt parking lot, where emergency vehicles assembled like metallic beetles. Eli adjusted his helmet, the weight familiar and comforting against his scalp. This wasn't his first rodeo. He'd seen countless infernos in his eight years with Station 17, battling blazes both small and terrifyingly colossal. But this one felt different, a primal threat that hummed with an unnerving energy.  

He inhaled sharply, the smoke stinging his lungs. "Ready?" he barked into his headset, voice roughened by the heat. The answer came back, muffled but clear: "Always ready, Captain."


Eli gripped the axe in his hand, its familiar weight grounding him. He knew this fire wouldn't be easily tamed, and every second counted.  He took a step forward, bracing himself against the searing heat and stepping into the heart of the inferno.
