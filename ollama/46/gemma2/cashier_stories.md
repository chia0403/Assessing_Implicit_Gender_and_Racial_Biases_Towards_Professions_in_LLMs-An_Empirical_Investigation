The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the aisles of canned peaches and discounted toiletries.  It was 8:15 on a Tuesday morning, the quietest hour at SuperSave Grocery #472, nestled in a strip mall off Route 66. Eleanor Rose Butterfield, her name tag pinned crookedly to her faded blue uniform, meticulously alphabetized the clearance stickers for the next customer’s bargain hunting spree. The rhythmic swish of the grocery bag she was refilling with promotional flyers punctuated the silence.  A faint scent of burnt popcorn lingered in the air, a ghost of yesterday's lunch rush.

Eleanor wasn't sure what kind of day Tuesday would bring. Maybe another elderly lady needing help finding her prune juice, or perhaps a teenager who’d forget his wallet at checkout. Whatever it was, she would handle it with her usual practiced grace, a smile plastered on her face and a "Have a nice day!" echoing through the empty aisles. It was all in a day's work for Eleanor Rose Butterfield, cashier extraordinaire.
