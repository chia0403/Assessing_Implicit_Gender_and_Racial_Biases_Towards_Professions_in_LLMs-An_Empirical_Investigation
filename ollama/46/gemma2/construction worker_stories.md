The whine of the jackhammer was a familiar lullaby to Liam “Big L” O’Connell. It vibrated through his bones, up his spine, and settled somewhere just behind his eyes as a dull ache. He squinted at the morning sun, a pale disc struggling to pierce the smog-choked sky above New York City.  

Liam was perched precariously on scaffolding, twenty stories high, overseeing the demolition of an old office building. Rust-colored dust hung heavy in the air, coating everything in a gritty film. The ground below thrummed with the constant pulse of the city – honking taxis, distant sirens, the murmurs of thousands going about their day. He took a swig from his thermos of lukewarm coffee, savoring the bitter taste that always seemed to match the day's grime. 

Today was different though. A flicker of unease danced beneath Liam’s usual stoic facade.  His father, a man who’d built this city with his own two hands, had called last night. His voice, usually gruff and steady, had been strained, filled with an urgency Liam hadn't heard before. Something was wrong, something big, and it involved the family business - O'Connell Construction - and Liam needed to be back in town, pronto.
