Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of Silas “Sly” McAlister’s van, each drop exploding into a miniature geyser on the rusted metal. The wind howled like a banshee, whipping sleet across the deserted street in Port Ravenwood, a fishing town clinging precariously to the edge of a craggy cliff overlooking the churning North Sea. 

Sly, hunched over his workbench inside the van, swore under his breath as he tightened another bolt on his toolbox. He hated this time of year – storms always seemed to coincide with the most urgent plumbing calls. And tonight was no exception. Mrs. Grimshaw, a notoriously demanding woman who lived in the lighthouse overlooking the stormy sea, had called about a “gurgling monstrosity” in her kitchen sink.  

Sly glanced at his battered phone, its screen faintly illuminating his weathered face. 10:32 PM. Perfect timing for a Friday night adventure, he thought wryly, forcing a smile despite the gnawing anxiety in his gut. He always felt a prickle of unease when called to Mrs. Grimshaw's lighthouse – something about its isolation and her unsettling silence made him feel watched, even on clear days.  


Tonight, with the storm raging around him, that feeling was amplified tenfold.
