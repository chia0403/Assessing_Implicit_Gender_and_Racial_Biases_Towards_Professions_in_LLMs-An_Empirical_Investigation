The fluorescent lights hummed above Eloise Everly’s head, casting a sterile, pale glow over the blood-spattered examination tables. The scent of antiseptic and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional metallic tang of drawn blood. It was always like this at Mercy General – a symphony of medical necessity conducted in a cacophony of beeps, whirs, and hushed whispers. Eloise, however, found solace in the rhythm. For fifteen years, she’d been a phlebotomist here, her steady hands drawing blood with the precision of a surgeon, her calm demeanor soothing even the most anxious patients. 

Today, though, something felt different. A tightness gripped Eloise’s chest, a premonition that hung in the air like the sterile scent. The usual routine – prepping the arm, applying the tourniquet, finding the vein – seemed to move in slow motion.  Her gaze drifted to the name on the next patient's chart: Mr. Samuel Thorne. A chill ran down her spine. She knew him. 


The hospital was a bustling hive of activity, its corridors echoing with hurried footsteps and hushed conversations. Eloise felt the weight of responsibility settle upon her shoulders as she prepared for her shift. Every drop of blood drawn held significance, a tiny piece of the puzzle that helped doctors diagnose and treat their patients. But today, the weight felt heavier, laced with a sense of foreboding that wouldn't be silenced.
