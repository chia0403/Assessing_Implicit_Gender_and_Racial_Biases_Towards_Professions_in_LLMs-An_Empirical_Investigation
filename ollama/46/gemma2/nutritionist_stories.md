The aroma of roasted turmeric and cardamom clung to Amelia "Amy" Everly like a second skin. It was her signature scent, a blend she'd crafted herself to infuse her clinic with a sense of calm and well-being.  

Her San Francisco practice, nestled on the bustling edge of Hayes Valley, hummed with the quiet energy of early morning appointments. Sunlight streamed through the large windows, illuminating shelves stocked with organic teas, artisanal honey jars, and hand-painted mugs bearing inspirational quotes about healthy living. 

Amy, her dark hair pulled back in a neat bun and a serene smile gracing her lips, adjusted the diffuser, allowing the earthy scent to further envelop the space. Her patients wouldn't just be receiving nutritional guidance; they'd be stepping into an oasis of tranquility, a haven from the city's frenetic pace. 


But today, Amy felt a prickle of unease beneath her usual calm facade.  A woman she hadn't met before sat in the waiting room, her eyes darting nervously around the space. Her posture was rigid, her hands clenched tightly together, a stark contrast to the relaxed energy that usually permeated the clinic. This wasn't just another patient seeking advice on managing their cholesterol or improving their digestion. Something about this woman, something in her haunted gaze, told Amy she was about to be plunged into a case far more complex than anything she'd encountered before.
