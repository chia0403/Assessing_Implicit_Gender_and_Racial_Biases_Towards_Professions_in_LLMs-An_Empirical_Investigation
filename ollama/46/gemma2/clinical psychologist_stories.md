The flickering neon sign outside "Therapy on Tenth" cast a sickly green glow across Dr. Evelyn Albright's face as she stepped out into the humid July night.  A stray cat darted between her ankles, a fleeting shadow in the urban jungle that was downtown Seattle. The air hung thick with the scent of rain and stale cigarettes, a familiar aroma to anyone who spent their evenings navigating this gritty corner of the city. 

Evelyn sighed, adjusting the strap of her leather bag. Another long day at the office, another parade of anxieties, traumas, and broken dreams. She'd walked in expecting tired parents, anxious teenagers, and the occasional workaholic spiraling into burnout. But tonight, she'd encountered something different, something unsettling...  something that whispered of a darkness lurking beneath the surface of even the most seemingly ordinary lives. 


As Evelyn crossed the street, the rain began to fall, each drop exploding against the asphalt in a miniature burst of sound. The city, already cloaked in shadows, seemed to contract further, its vibrant pulse dimming under the weight of the approaching storm.  Evelyn pulled her collar tighter, her thoughts racing back to the patient who had left an indelible mark on her day. This wasn't just another case file; this was a mystery begging to be solved.
