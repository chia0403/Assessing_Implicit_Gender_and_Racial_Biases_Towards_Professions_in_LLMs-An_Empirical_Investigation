The rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel echoed through the cavernous workshop, a symphony as familiar to Elias Thorne as his own heartbeat. Dust motes danced in the shafts of sunlight that pierced through the grime-coated skylights, illuminating particles swirling like miniature galaxies. Outside, the bustling marketplace of Aethelgard hummed with life, but within the confines of Elias's domain, time seemed to move at a slower pace, dictated by the steady rasp of grinding stone and the patient sculptor’s hand. 

Elias, calloused hands stained with ochre from the clay binding his chosen medium, meticulously chipped away at a slab of pale grey alabaster. He envisioned the final piece – a graceful swan taking flight, its wings outstretched in perpetual motion – a monument to freedom that would grace the fountain in the town square. But today, even the familiar rhythm of his work felt discordant, a dissonant note amidst the usual harmony. A nameless unease gnawed at him, a premonition as sharp and cold as the chisel he wielded. 


The workshop was a testament to Elias's craft: shelves overflowing with tools, half-finished sculptures nestled amongst raw blocks of stone, and sketches meticulously detailing his latest commissions.  He had inherited the space from his father, a renowned stonemason whose legacy loomed large over Aethelgard. Now, Elias felt the weight of that legacy more than ever, a responsibility that seemed to press down on him with increasing urgency.
