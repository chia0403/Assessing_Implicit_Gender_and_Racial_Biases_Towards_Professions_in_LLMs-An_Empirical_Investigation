The sun hung low in the sky, casting long shadows across the cracked asphalt of Highway 397. The air was thick with the scent of diesel and dust, punctuated by the occasional screech of tires on the unforgiving road. This wasn't paradise, but it was home for Bartholomew "Barty" Finchley. He stood at the edge of his assigned stretch, surveying the day’s work ahead: a pothole as wide as a bathtub and twice as deep, threatening to swallow any unsuspecting vehicle whole.

Barty adjusted his dusty orange vest and reached for the tools strapped to his waist –  a trowel, hammer, and a wrench that had seen more battles than a veteran soldier. He squinted at the horizon, where the fiery orb dipped below the endless expanse of scrubland. Another day on 397, another fight against the relentless march of time and weather. He wasn’t sure what tomorrow would bring, but he knew one thing for certain: he'd be here, battling potholes and patching dreams in equal measure.
