The late August sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's neck, making his sweat sting his eyes. He wiped it away with the back of his hand, leaving a smudge of dirt across his forehead. His muscles screamed in protest as he wrestled another overgrown rose bush into submission, its thorny branches snagging at his work gloves like angry claws. The air hung heavy with the scent of cut grass and decaying leaves, a familiar aroma that usually brought Eli comfort. Today, however, it felt oppressive, mirroring the weight pressing down on his chest.  

He stood in the manicured chaos of Mrs. Hawthorne's garden, a sprawling expanse of neglected beauty in the heart of suburban Connecticut.  Giant sunflowers drooped over their fences, wildflowers choked out delicate ferns, and ivy crept like a green serpent across the ancient stone statues dotting the property. It was beautiful, Eli had to admit, but demanding â€“ a testament to Mrs. Hawthorne's past passion for gardening, now faded with her failing health.

Eli had come here hoping for solace, not another battleground. He needed to clear his head, focus on something other than the storm brewing inside him, but the overgrown garden mirrored his own tangled emotions.
