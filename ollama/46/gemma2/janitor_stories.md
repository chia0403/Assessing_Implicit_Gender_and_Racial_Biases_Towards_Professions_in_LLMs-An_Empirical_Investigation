The rhythmic *scritch-scratch* of Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne's floor buffer was the soundtrack to her Thursday night. She hummed along, off-key and cheerfully, as she worked her way through the cavernous halls of the Grand Blackwood Library. The scent of old paper and leather hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket woven with whispers of forgotten stories.  

Amelia loved this time of night. The sun had dipped below the horizon hours ago, leaving behind a sky stained with bruised purple and fading orange. Outside, the city hummed with life she barely heard. Inside, it was just her, the ghosts of countless readers, and the silent guardians of knowledge lining the towering shelves.  She knew every creak of the floorboards, every groan of the ancient oak beams, every flicker in the dusty chandeliers that cast long shadows across the marble floors. 


Amelia wasn't a scholar, but she felt a kinship with these books, these whispers from the past. She saw stories in the faded spines, heard them echo in the rustle of turning pages. The library was her sanctuary, a refuge from the bustling world beyond its grand oak doors.
