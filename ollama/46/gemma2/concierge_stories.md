The air in the Grand Fontaine Hotel hung thick with the scent of old money and jasmine perfume.  A delicate ballet of bellhops carrying luggage, maids pushing trolleys laden with fresh linen, and chattering guests navigating the marble-floored halls played out around Eloise Beatrice Beaumont, head concierge. 

Eloise leaned against the imposing brass counter, her emerald green eyes scanning the incoming crowd. She knew most of them by name â€“ the eccentric millionaire who always requested his bath filled with rose petals, the weary businessman whose only solace was a daily double espresso at precisely 8:00 am, and the blushing honeymooners giggling over champagne in the corner.  But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, as though an unseen storm was brewing within the gilded walls of the Grand Fontaine.

The air shifted, carrying with it the faint whisper of a foreign accent, followed by the click of unfamiliar heels on the polished floor.  Eloise straightened, a hint of anticipation playing on her lips.  A new guest had arrived. And Eloise Beaumont always enjoyed a challenge.
