The sun had barely cracked over the horizon, painting the eastern sky in hues of lavender and peach, when Bartholomew Thistlewick surveyed his domain. Dew glistened on the meticulously manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor, catching the weak morning light like scattered diamonds. Every blade of grass was at an ideal height, every hedge trimmed to a perfect silhouette. Bartholomew, or Bart as he preferred, ran a calloused hand over a particularly velvety patch of clover, savoring the feeling of its smoothness beneath his fingertips.

Blackwood Manor wasn't just any manor; it was steeped in history, whispers of ghosts and forgotten romances swirling around its grand facade like autumn leaves in a gentle breeze. Bartholomew had been its groundskeeper for twenty years, inheriting the position from his father who inherited it from his. It was a legacy he took pride in, tending to the sprawling gardens with the same dedication that generations before him had.  But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine, leaving him unsettled despite the calm serenity of the morning. He couldn't place it, this disquietude, but it clung to him like a persistent shadow.
