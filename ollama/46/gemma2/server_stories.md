The rhythmic clang of silverware against plates was a familiar lullaby to Amelia "Amy" Bellrose. She knew every shift at The Rusty Spoon like the back of her hand – the predictable ebb and flow of the lunchtime rush, the grumpy regulars who always ordered the same thing, the hurried date nights that filled the air with nervous laughter. 

Tonight, though, felt different. A low hum buzzed beneath the usual clatter, a tension prickling Amy's skin like static electricity. It wasn't just the unusually packed dining room – tables crammed together, patrons spilling onto the sidewalk waiting for seats – it was something in the air, an invisible force that made her grip on the tray of water glasses tighter than usual. 

The Rusty Spoon itself seemed to be holding its breath. The faded red booths, once worn smooth by years of conversation and spilled gravy, felt suddenly sharp and angular. The flickering gas lamps cast long shadows that danced like phantoms against the walls adorned with dusty old photographs of forgotten jazz bands. Even the smell of frying onions and simmering tomato sauce seemed to have taken on a sharper, more metallic tang. 


Amy took a deep breath, trying to quell the unease creeping into her gut. She was just a server, after all. What did she know about strange occurrences? Yet, as she moved between tables, a prickling awareness grew stronger – something wasn't right, and tonight, at The Rusty Spoon, things were about to get very interesting indeed.
