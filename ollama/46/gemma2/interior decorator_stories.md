The scent of fresh lilies and beeswax polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint metallic tang of renovation dust. Emilia Rose Hawthorne surveyed her latest project: a dilapidated Victorian townhouse in need of resuscitation. Sunlight streamed through dusty windows, illuminating peeling wallpaper and chipped marble fireplaces. It was a symphony of faded grandeur, whispering tales of forgotten elegance. 

Emilia ran a gloved hand over the rough texture of a worn oak banister, imagining it restored to its former glory, polished to a gleam that would reflect the vibrant hues she envisioned for the space. She had fallen in love with the bones of this house, sensing its potential beneath the layers of neglect. This wasn't just another job; it was a chance to breathe life back into a forgotten gem.  


This townhouse, perched precariously on a cobbled street in Edinburgh, Scotland, promised to be her most challenging, yet rewarding project yet.
