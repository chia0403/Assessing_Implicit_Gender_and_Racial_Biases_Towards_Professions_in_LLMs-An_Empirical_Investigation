The bell above the door jingled merrily as Amelia Rose Butterfield adjusted her pink-tinted spectacles, peering over them at the customer entering. It was a Tuesday afternoon, the slowest time at "Hairspray Heaven," and Amelia wouldn't have minded another few hours of blissful silence with nothing but the scent of lavender shampoo and the rhythmic whirring of her blow dryer for company. But today, fate, it seemed, had other plans. 

The customer was a whirlwind of anxiety wrapped in a poorly-fitting suit. His hair, a once proud cascade of auburn waves, now resembled a nest disturbed by a particularly clumsy bird. He shuffled nervously towards the counter, tripping over his own feet and knocking over a display of nail polish bottles with a resounding clang. 

Amelia sighed. This was going to be interesting.  


**Setting:** "Hairspray Heaven," a small, independent beauty salon tucked away on a quiet side street in a bustling city neighborhood. The shop is crammed with vintage hair styling tools, overflowing shelves of colorful cosmetics, and the faint scent of hairspray hanging heavy in the air.
