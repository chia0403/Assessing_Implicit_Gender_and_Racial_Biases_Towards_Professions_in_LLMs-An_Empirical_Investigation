Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Officer Amelia "Amy" Beaumont's office, each drop a tiny drumbeat in the symphony of urban misery that played out outside her sixth-floor window. The flickering neon signs of downtown Seattle cast long, distorted shadows across the slick asphalt, blurring the edges of reality like an old film reel.

Inside, Amy hunched over her desk, a mountain of paperwork threatening to engulf her. She chewed on the end of her pen, her brow furrowed in concentration as she reviewed the latest probation report for Marcus "The Wolf" Walker, a former petty thief with a penchant for getting into trouble.  His last reported violation: failing to attend his mandatory anger management sessions. Again. 


Amy sighed, rubbing her temples. Another day, another case of trying to nudge someone back onto the right path in a city that seemed determined to push them down. She glanced at the clock - 5:45 PM. Just fifteen minutes until she could escape this concrete jungle and find some semblance of peace in the quiet solitude of her apartment. But first, there was Marcus "The Wolf" Walker to deal with.
