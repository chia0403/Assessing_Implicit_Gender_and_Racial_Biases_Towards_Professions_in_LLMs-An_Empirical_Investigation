The midday sun beat down on Manhattan, turning the steel and glass canyons into shimmering mirages. Inside one such tower, Amelia Beatrice Davenport adjusted her silk blouse, smoothing out a nonexistent wrinkle. Her office, on the 37th floor of the Sterling Bank headquarters, was a testament to corporate success: minimalist furniture, panoramic city views, and an impossibly organized desk where only the faintest smudge hinted at human presence.

Amelia, CEO since she was 35, had built her empire with grit and relentless ambition. But today, something felt different. The usual surge of adrenaline that accompanied a demanding board meeting was absent. Instead, a knot of unease tightened in her stomach.  She glanced at the framed photo on her desk – a younger Amelia beaming beside her late father, his arm around her shoulder. A wave of longing washed over her. 

She’d sacrificed so much for this life: personal relationships, free time, even sleep. Was it all worth it? The board meeting started in ten minutes. She had to decide.
