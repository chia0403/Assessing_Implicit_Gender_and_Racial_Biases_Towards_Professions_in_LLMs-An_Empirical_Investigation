The rhythmic clatter of plastic blocks echoed through Ms. Elara Willowbrook's classroom, punctuated by squeals of laughter and the occasional frustrated sigh. Sunshine streamed through the large windows, casting rainbows across the colourful alphabet rug where tiny bodies tumbled in a game of "tag you're it!"

Elara watched with a smile as her kindergarten class buzzed with pre-school energy. She loved this time of day â€“ the boundless enthusiasm, the innocent curiosity, the sheer joy that radiated from each giggling child. They were sponges, soaking up knowledge and life experiences with an unbridled eagerness that could melt even the coldest heart. 

But Elara wasn't oblivious to the subtle shift in energy as lunch approached. The playful chatter began to wane, replaced by a collective whining for their favourite snacks and a desperate scramble for bathroom breaks. It was a familiar dance, one she knew well after five years of teaching these little bundles of sunshine.  

Today, however, something felt different. A prickle of unease danced along Elara's spine, a feeling she couldn't quite place. Perhaps it was the way the normally boisterous Liam had retreated to a corner, his face pale and silent. Or maybe it was the unusual silence coming from Maya, who usually never missed an opportunity to belt out a tune.  Whatever it was, Elara knew something wasn't quite right.


The classroom felt like a pressure cooker, poised on the brink of eruption. As lunch time approached, Elara braced herself for what promised to be anything but a typical afternoon.
