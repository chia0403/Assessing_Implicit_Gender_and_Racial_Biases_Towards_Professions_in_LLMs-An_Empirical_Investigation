The scent of freshly baked bread drifted from the bakery across the street, mingling with the exhaust fumes that perpetually hung in the air above Elmwood Avenue. Amelia Rose Cartwright, her blonde ponytail swaying with each brisk step she took, adjusted her sensible pumps and surveyed the dilapidated Victorian townhouse before her. A faded "For Sale" sign creaked precariously in the wind, its once vibrant red paint now peeling like sunburnt skin. 

Amelia inhaled deeply, bracing herself for the usual chorus of complaints from potential buyers. This one was a fixer-upper, through and through - leaky roof, outdated wiring, a garden overgrown with weeds. But she saw past the cracks and peeling wallpaper, envisioning a charming haven, bathed in sunlight, overflowing with life once more. Amelia thrived on these challenges, breathing new life into forgotten properties, turning them into homes filled with laughter and memories.  This, she knew, would be no different.
