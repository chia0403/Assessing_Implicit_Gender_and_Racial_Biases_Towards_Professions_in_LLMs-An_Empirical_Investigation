Rain lashed against the attic window, mimicking the frantic tapping of Eleanor Amelia Thistlewick’s fingers on her worn typewriter keys. The air was thick with the scent of dust and old paper, a familiar aroma in her sanctuary – the cramped, cobweb-filled attic room that served as both her home and her office. 

Eleanor, or Ellie as she preferred, hunched over her desk, bathed in the dim glow of a single flickering lamp. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, tearing at the ancient roof of her grandmother’s Victorian mansion. It was a tempestuous night, one that felt perfectly suited to the dark and brooding story she was wrestling with. 

But Ellie wasn't writing about ghosts or ghouls tonight. She was grappling with something far more unsettling – the blank page. The words, usually so eager to spill from her mind onto the paper, were stubbornly silent. Her deadline loomed like a spectral judge, and the pressure was building, constricting her chest until it felt as though she could barely breathe.
