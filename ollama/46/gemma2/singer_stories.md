The stage lights felt less like illumination and more like an oven's heat radiating down on Esmeralda "Esme" Bellweather. Her heart hammered against her ribs, a frantic drum solo drowning out the low murmur of the crowd waiting for her to begin. The scent of stale beer and anticipation hung heavy in the air of the Blue Moon Tavern, a dimly lit dive bar nestled in the back alleys of New Orleans. 

Esme gripped the microphone stand tighter, its cool metal grounding her slightly. Her fingers nervously traced the worn leather of her guitar strap, anchoring her to the familiar weight of her instrument. Tonight was different. This wasn't just another open mic night for a struggling musician trying to make ends meet. This was her chance. A scout from a major label was rumored to be in attendance, his ears attuned to raw talent, hungry for the next big thing.


And Esme, with her soulful voice and bluesy melodies born from the city's very heart, felt like she might just be it.
