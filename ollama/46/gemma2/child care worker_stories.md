The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Brighton, casting a sickly yellow glow over the chaotic scene before her.  Tiny bodies, fuelled by sugar and boundless energy, zipped around the brightly coloured playroom like caffeinated bees. Amy sighed, leaning against the wall with a mug of lukewarm coffee that tasted more like cardboard than caffeine. This was 3 o'clock at Sunnyside Daycare, the hour affectionately known as "The Hunger Games" â€“  a battle royale for snacks, attention, and the dwindling sanity of the staff.  

Amy glanced at her watch: 2:58 PM. Two minutes until free play descended into organized pandemonium. She took a sip of her coffee, grimacing, and straightened her nametag that read "Ms. Amy." Just another Tuesday afternoon in paradise.


**Setting:** Sunnyside Daycare - A bustling facility filled with vibrant colours, playful decorations, and the constant soundtrack of squeals, laughter, and the occasional meltdown. The playroom, where the story opens, is a maze of brightly coloured furniture, toys scattered across the floor, and climbing structures that resemble miniature mountains.
