The harsh fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on Amelia Cartwright’s worried face. She knelt beside the gurney, her gloved fingers gently pressing against Mrs. O’Malley’s clammy forehead. The air in the small exam room at Mercy General Hospital was thick with the scent of antiseptic and fear. Outside the window, dusk bled into night, painting the sprawling city skyline in hues of orange and purple. 

Amelia had worked in this understaffed emergency room for five years, seen her share of heartbreak and triumph. But Mrs. O’Malley's case felt different, a tangled web of pre-existing conditions woven together by a sudden, violent turn.  A gnawing sense of urgency pulsed through Amelia, each tick of the clock echoing the frantic beat of her own heart. She had to act fast, analyze every detail, and pray it wouldn’t be too late.
