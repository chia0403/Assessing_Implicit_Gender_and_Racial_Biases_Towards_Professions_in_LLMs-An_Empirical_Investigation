The rhythmic clicking of Eleanor "Ellie" Vance's heels echoed through the sterile hallway of Willow Creek Rehabilitation Center. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, casting long shadows across the linoleum floor. Outside, birds chirped and leaves rustled in the gentle breeze, a symphony Ellie found oddly comforting amidst the hushed solemnity of the facility. Today was her first day at Willow Creek, and she felt a knot of both excitement and trepidation tighten in her stomach.

Willow Creek wasn't your typical rehabilitation center. It specialized in patients with neurological conditions, their paths to recovery often long and arduous. Ellie had dedicated years to her profession, driven by a deep-seated desire to help people regain their independence, but the gravity of this particular facility weighed heavily on her. 

The scent of antiseptic mingled with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer, a familiar blend that both grounded and unsettled her. As she approached Room 214, a sliver of doubt crept in.  Could she truly make a difference here?  She took a deep breath, straightened her crisp white blouse, and knocked softly on the door.
