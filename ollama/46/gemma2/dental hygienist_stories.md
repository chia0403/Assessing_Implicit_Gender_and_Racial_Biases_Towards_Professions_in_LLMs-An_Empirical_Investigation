Sunlight streamed through the bay windows of Dr. Thompson's office, bathing the sterile white room in a warm glow. The aroma of bleach and cinnamon mouthwash hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the occasional rustle of dental floss packs being dispensed from their wall dispenser. Ellie loved this place – the predictability of it all, the familiar routine, the comforting rhythm of her work. 

But today, something felt different. Mrs. Henderson, a usually chatty woman known for her gossip about the neighborhood and her endless tales of her poodle, Pierre, was uncharacteristically quiet. Her eyes were downcast, and a tremor ran through her hand as she clenched her jaw against Ellie's probing instruments. 


"Everything alright, Mrs. Henderson?" Ellie asked softly, pausing to check her work in the tiny mirror.

Mrs. Henderson took a deep breath, her voice catching. "Just... a bit under the weather, dear."
 
Ellie knew there was more to it than just a cold. A prickle of concern shot through her. The silence that followed was thick with unspoken words.  What could be troubling Mrs. Henderson so much? Ellie longed to know. This wasn't just another routine cleaning; this felt like the start of something else entirely.
