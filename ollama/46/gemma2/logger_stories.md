The air hung heavy with the scent of damp earth and pine needles as Elias Blackwood hefted his chainsaw onto his shoulder. A symphony of birdsong filled the morning, but it was quickly drowned out by the low rumble of the engine as Elias brought the saw to life. Sunlight, still shy behind the dense canopy of towering Douglas firs, cast long shadows across the forest floor. 

Elias adjusted the strap on his harness, the weight of the chainsaws digging into his shoulders. He took a deep breath, the crisp air filling his lungs with the familiar taste of pine and freedom.
