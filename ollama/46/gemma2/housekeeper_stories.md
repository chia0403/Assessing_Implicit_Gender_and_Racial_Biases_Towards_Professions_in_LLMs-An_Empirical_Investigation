Eleanor ran a hand along the spines of ancient leather-bound volumes, their titles whispering tales of forgotten grandeur and shadowed scandals. Each book held a story, each room a hidden memory, all carefully preserved within these gilded walls. And Eleanor, as the unassuming guardian of Blackwood Manor, knew them all better than anyone.
