The flickering gaslight cast long shadows across Beatrice Elmsworth's cluttered desk. The scent of dusty parchment and stale coffee hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume in her tiny accounting office tucked away on a side street in Edinburgh. Outside, the city slumbered, shrouded in a blanket of fog that swallowed the sound of horse-drawn carriages and distant laughter. But inside, Beatrice's world was a whirlwind of ledgers, invoices, and receipts.

Her quill scratched furiously across parchment as she balanced the books for Mr. MacAllister, a local apothecary with an unfortunate tendency to overestimate his stock of dragonbane.  Beatrice sighed, pinching the bridge of her nose. Dragonbane wasn’t exactly in high demand these days, especially after the Ministry of Magic had declared its use in household remedies “excessively volatile.”

The rhythmic click of the grandfather clock on the wall was the only sound that dared interrupt Beatrice's concentration. She preferred the quiet solitude of her office, the company of numbers and figures a comforting counterpoint to the unpredictable chaos of life outside. Until, that is, a frantic rapping at the door shattered the silence.
