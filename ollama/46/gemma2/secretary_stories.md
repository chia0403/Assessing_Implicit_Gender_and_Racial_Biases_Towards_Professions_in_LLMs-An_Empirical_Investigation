The whirring of the antiquated electric typewriter was the soundtrack to Eleanor Pearl's morning. She tapped out another memo for Mr. Fitzwilliam, his demands ever-increasing in their absurdity. "Request the latest meteorological report from the Bermuda Triangle," he'd barked this morning, his voice rasping like sandpaper on old wood. Eleanor knew the Bermuda Triangle held no more fascination for him than the weather forecast â€“ it was simply a tool to flex his eccentricities.  

Eleanor worked as secretary at Fitzwilliam & Sons, a publishing house that had seen better days. Its once grand offices in Mayfair were now faded and cramped, smelling of stale paper dust and forgotten ambitions. Sunlight struggled to penetrate the grime-coated windows, casting long, melancholy shadows across the worn Persian rugs. The building itself seemed to sigh under the weight of its own history, echoing with whispers of forgotten stories and the clatter of typewriters from a bygone era.


This was Eleanor's world: a symphony of dusty manuscripts, ringing telephones, and Mr. Fitzwilliam's unpredictable moods.  She navigated it with quiet competence, her neat handwriting and unyielding efficiency a shield against the chaos that threatened to engulf her. But today, something felt different. A tremor of unease ran through her, a prickling sensation on the back of her neck. As she glanced at the dusty clock on the wall, she couldn't shake the feeling that this day was about to take an unexpected turn.
