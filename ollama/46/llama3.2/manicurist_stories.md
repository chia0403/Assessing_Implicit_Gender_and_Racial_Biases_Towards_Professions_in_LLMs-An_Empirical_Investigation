The scent of sweet lotus perfume and Japanese tea wafted from the steamers, mingling with the faint tang of nail polish remover, as Akira hummed along to the soothing melody playing in the background.

It was a chilly autumn evening, and the crowds that normally thronged the streets had dissipated for the night, leaving behind only the occasional late-night reveler stumbling out of the karaoke bars or the 24-hour ramen shops. Outside, the city's neon lights reflected off the wet pavement like a kaleidoscope of colors, casting an otherworldly glow over the rows of worn, cherry blossom-lined sidewalks.
