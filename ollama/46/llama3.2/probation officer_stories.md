Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle glistened like polished onyx as Probation Officer Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her unmarked SUV and onto the wet pavement. She had just received a call from her supervisor, informing her that she would be taking over the case of 25-year-old Jesse Reynolds, a former juvenile offender who had just been released from juvenile detention after serving two years for felony theft.

Lexi had worked with Jesse's family since he was a teenager, and she knew his story all too well. He had grown up in the rough neighborhood of South Seattle, where gangs and poverty were constant companions. Despite her best efforts to steer him towards a better path, Jesse had fallen off the wagon more than once, and now he was facing another chapter in his life – one that Lexi hoped would be different.

As she lit a cigarette on the corner of 12th Avenue and South Main Street, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that this case was going to be trouble. The Reynolds family had been struggling for years, and Jesse's return home had set off warning signs all over town. But it was Lexi's job to keep him safe, not her own – so she took a deep drag on her cigarette and began the long walk towards his apartment complex.

The rain drummed against her jacket as she walked, casting eerie shadows on the walls of the rundown buildings that lined the street. The sounds of the city were muffled by the downpour, leaving only the distant hum of cars and the occasional shout from a passerby to break the silence. It was just another ordinary night in Seattle – or so it seemed.

But for Lexi Thompson, every case was different, and every client had a story waiting to be uncovered. And as she walked towards Jesse's apartment complex, she knew that this one might be the most complicated of all.
