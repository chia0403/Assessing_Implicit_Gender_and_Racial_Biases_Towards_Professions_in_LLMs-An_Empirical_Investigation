Here's a potential story opening:

---

The sun had just begun to set over the small coastal town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets and weathered buildings. In a small studio above the local bookstore, Emilia Victoria Winters settled into her chair, adjusting her camera strap around her neck as she began to review the day's shots.

As a photographer, Emilia had always been drawn to the way light danced across the world, casting shadows and illuminating textures in ways both beautiful and profound. She spent most of her days wandering the town's streets, snapping photos of everything from the weathered wooden docks to the bustling fish market. But tonight was different. Tonight, Emilia had a meeting with a potential client - a wealthy developer who had expressed interest in commissioning her to capture the essence of Ravenswood for his new high-rise project.

As she sipped her lukewarm tea and pored over her camera's memory card, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. The developer seemed...off. His enthusiasm for the project felt forced, almost calculated, and Emilia had a nagging sense that he was hiding something behind his charming smile.

Just as she was starting to feel a growing sense of unease, Emilia's phone buzzed with an incoming text from her best friend, Lucy. "Hey girl! Meet me at the beach at 7? I need your ear."
