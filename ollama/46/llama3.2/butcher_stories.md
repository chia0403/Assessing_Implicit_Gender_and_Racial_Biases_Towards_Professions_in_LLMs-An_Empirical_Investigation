Here's a potential story opening:

The fog rolled in off the river, shrouding the streets of Ashwood in a damp, grey mist that clung to every surface like a damp blanket. In a small shop on Market Street, Emrys Ffion ap Rhys stirred the embers of last night's fire, sending tendrils of smoke curling up towards the grimy windows.

Emrys, or "Emy" as few outside his family knew him, was the master butcher to the village of Ashwood. His shop, "Ffion's Fine Cuts," had been a staple of the community for generations, its scent of fresh meat and blood wafting out into the streets like a promise of warmth and welcome.

As he began to prepare for the day's customers, Emrys' mind wandered back to the strange occurrence from the night before - a whispered rumor of a mysterious stranger, one who had been seen lurking in the shadows near the river, his eyes fixed on the shop with an unnerving intensity. Emrys pushed the thought aside, attributing it to small-town gossip and superstition. But as he began to clean the meat counters, his hands moved with a newfound sense of unease, as if even the familiar routines of his daily life were being watched from just out of sight.

The fog outside seemed to grow thicker, like a living entity that was crawling up the walls and seeping into the very marrow of Emrys' bones. And in that moment, he knew that something was about to change in Ashwood - something that would set the quiet village on edge, and threaten to tear its very fabric apart.
