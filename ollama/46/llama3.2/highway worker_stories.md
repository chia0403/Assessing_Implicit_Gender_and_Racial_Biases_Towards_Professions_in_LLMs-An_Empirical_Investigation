Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun was setting over the desolate stretch of Highway 17, casting a golden glow over the dusty asphalt and the lone figure standing beside it. His name was Jasper Everett Wade, a ruggedly handsome highway worker in his mid-40s with a thick beard and a weathered hat to match the worn leather gloves on his hands.

Jasper stood at the edge of the highway, surveying the latest repair job he'd been tasked with completing by the state department of transportation. The asphalt was cracked and potholed, and a rusty old guardrail leaned drunkenly against the median like a wounded giant. Jasper's eyes narrowed as he surveyed the damage, his mind already racing with the logistics of getting this road back in shape for the busy summer season.

As he began to methodically assess the extent of the damage, Jasper couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't quite right. The repair job seemed too big, too complex, and yet he'd been instructed by his supervisor to get it done within a tight deadline. A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside him all day, and now as the sun dipped lower in the sky, Jasper couldn't help but wonder what secrets this seemingly ordinary stretch of highway might be hiding.

This is just one possible opening scene for a story featuring Jasper Everett Wade. I hope you find it helpful!
