Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of Seattle gleamed like polished onyx as August "Augie" Wynter stepped out of his office and onto the sidewalk. It was a chilly autumn evening, the kind that made you want to wrap yourself in a warm blanket and forget about the world outside. But Augie wasn't here to get cozy; he was here to find answers.

As he lit a cigarette, the neon lights of the city reflected off the wet pavement, casting a gaudy glow over the deserted streets. The rain drummed against his fedora, making it tilt precariously on his head. Augie adjusted it, taking a long drag on his cigarette as he surveyed the scene before him.

His office was a small, cramped space above a pawn shop in the heart of the city's oldest neighborhood. The sign above the door read "Wynter Investigations" in faded letters, and Augie knew that most people thought it was just another run-of-the-mill detective agency. But Augie had his own reputation to uphold â€“ one built on a lifetime of hard work, sharp instincts, and an uncanny ability to sniff out secrets.

As he stood there, puffing on his cigarette and listening to the rain, Augie felt a shiver run down his spine. He had received a call earlier that day from an anonymous source, claiming to have information about a case that would shake the very foundations of the city's elite. And now, as he gazed out into the night, he couldn't help but wonder what kind of trouble was waiting for him.

The phone on his desk jolted Augie back to reality, shrill and insistent in the silence. He snuffed out his cigarette and picked up the receiver, his eyes narrowing as he heard the gravelly voice on the other end.

"Augie Wynter? This is Emily from the Red Lion. I have a case that needs your... particular skills."

Augie's ears perked up, intrigued. The Red Lion was one of Seattle's most exclusive nightclubs, and if they were calling him in, it meant this was going to be big.

"What kind of case?" he asked, already knowing he wouldn't get an answer until he got there.

There was a pause on the other end of the line before Emily spoke up. "We have a problem with one of our patrons, Augie. A man who's been acting very... suspiciously."

Augie's gut began to churn with anticipation as he listened to Emily's words. This was going to be a case that would test his skills and push him to the limit. But as he glanced out into the rain-soaked night, he knew one thing for sure: Augie Wynter was ready for whatever came next.
