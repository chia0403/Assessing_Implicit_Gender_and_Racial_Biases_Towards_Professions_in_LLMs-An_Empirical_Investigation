Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun was setting over the ancient city of Petra, casting a warm orange glow over the intricate carvings and crumbling stone facades that lined the narrow canyon known as the Siq. Amidst the throngs of tourists and camera-wielding adventurers, one figure stood out: Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson, a seasoned tour guide with a quick wit and a deep knowledge of the city's secrets.

As she led her latest group of visitors through the narrow passage, Lexi couldn't help but feel a sense of pride and ownership over this ancient place. She had grown up in Jordan, the daughter of a local Bedouin family, and had spent countless hours exploring the ruins as a child. Now, at 28 years old, she was one of the most sought-after guides in Petra, known for her ability to weave together history, mythology, and cultural context into engaging and immersive experiences.

As the group approached the iconic Monastery, Lexi's mind began to wander to the strange sense of unease that had been growing inside her all day. It started with a cryptic message from an old friend, a fellow guide who had gone missing on one of his tours just days ago. The police had dismissed it as mere coincidence, but Lexi knew better - she had seen something that night, something that made her skin crawl and left her with a feeling of foreboding that wouldn't shake.

And now, as the sun dipped below the horizon and the stars began to twinkle overhead, Lexi couldn't shake the feeling that this tour was about to take an unexpected turn.
