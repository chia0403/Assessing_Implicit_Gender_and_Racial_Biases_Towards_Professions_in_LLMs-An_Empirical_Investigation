Here's a potential story opening:

As the sun dipped below the horizon, casting a warm orange glow over the cobblestone streets of 19th century Paris, Adèle Colette Fournier stepped out of her small atelier and into the cool evening air. The scent of fresh fabric and yesterday's linseed oil wafted out behind her, mingling with the sound of horse hooves on the Rue de Rivoli.

Adèle, a skilled tailor with a keen eye for detail and a passion for creating beautiful garments, had spent the day stitching intricate patterns onto silk dresses and repairing worn-out suits. Her small shop, tucked away in the heart of the Latin Quarter, was a haven for the city's fashion-conscious elite, who came to Adèle for her exceptional craftsmanship and discretion.

As she locked up the shop and made her way through the winding streets, Adèle's thoughts turned to the mysterious letter that had arrived earlier that day. The envelope, addressed in elegant script to "Madame Fournier," contained a single sentence: "Meet me at the Café des Anges at midnight. Come alone."

Adèle felt a shiver run down her spine as she wondered who could have sent such an intriguing message, and what they might want with her. She quickened her pace, anxious to get home and pour herself a cup of tea before the night's events began.

Little did Adèle know, this was only the beginning of a journey that would take her from the sewers of Paris to the highest echelons of society, and force her to confront secrets and lies that had been hidden for years.
