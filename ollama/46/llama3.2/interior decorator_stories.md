Here's a potential story opening and setting for an interior decorating mystery:

---

The sun had just set over the sleepy town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quaint streets lined with old oak trees and boutique shops. Inside the luxurious estate of the wealthy and reclusive Mrs. Adelaide Harrington, Emily Charlotte Wellington, renowned interior decorator to the crème de la crème of society, was about to embark on her most high-stakes project yet.

As she gazed out the floor-to-ceiling windows of Mrs. Harrington's grand study, Emily's eyes landed on the sprawling estate's latest addition: a gleaming new wing that would serve as the Harringtons' summer home in the Hamptons. With its sleek lines and modern finishes, the wing was meant to be a symbol of the family's status and wealth. But Emily had her doubts.

Mrs. Harrington herself flitted into the room, her silver hair styled perfectly and her designer gown sparkling in the fading light. "Emily, darling," she said, her voice like honey, "I trust you've been working tirelessly to bring this wing to life?"

Emily forced a smile as she turned from the window to face her client. She had known Mrs. Harrington for years, but she couldn't shake the feeling that there was something more to this project – something beneath the surface of gleaming marble and designer furnishings.

"I have," Emily replied, trying to keep her tone light. "But I did notice one peculiar request from your husband, Mr. Harrington. He wanted me to incorporate an unusual design element into the wing's living area: a vintage chandelier with...unusual provenance."

Mrs. Harrington's eyes narrowed ever so slightly, but she merely smiled again and said, "Oh, that old thing? Just a little something I'm sure will add some character to the space."

Emily raised an eyebrow but said nothing further, knowing that pushing Mrs. Harrington on the matter would be futile. For now, she focused on bringing this wing – and its enigmatic chandelier – to life.

Little did Emily know, however, that this project was about to become a lot more complicated than she ever could have imagined...
