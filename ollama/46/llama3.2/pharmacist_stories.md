Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of Ashwood were always at their most unforgiving on nights like these. The droplets slid down the windows of the small pharmacy on Main Street, casting tiny rivers that reflected the soft glow of the streetlights. Inside, pharmacist Emilia Rose Thompson wiped the condensation from the window with a white glove, her eyes fixed on the clock ticking away on the wall.

It was 10:47 PM on a Wednesday, and the streets were already emptying out for the night. The only sound was the soft hum of the refrigerators in the back and the occasional creak of the old wooden shelves. Emilia's gaze drifted to the row of prescription pads on her desk, the pens stacked neatly beside them like soldiers at attention.

As she began to tidy up the counter, a faint knock at the door made her pause. She raised an eyebrow, wondering who could be visiting at this late hour. The shop was closed, and the security system would have been triggered by now. A soft sigh escaped her lips as she made her way to the door.

The sign above it read "Emilia Rose Thompson, Pharmacist" in elegant script, and the glass panel allowed her a glimpse of the deserted street outside. Who could be out on this cold, drizzly night?
