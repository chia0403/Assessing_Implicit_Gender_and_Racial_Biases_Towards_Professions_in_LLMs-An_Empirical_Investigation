Here's a story opening:

The neon lights of the Manhattan skyline cast a cold glow over the bustling streets of Wall Street as Harrison Grant Wellington III stood at the edge of his office window, gazing out at the steel and glass towers that seemed to stretch on forever. As one of the top stock brokers at Wells & Company, he was used to being in control, always on top of the market trends and making the big deals that made headlines. But tonight, Harrison's mind was elsewhere.

It had been a long day, filled with meetings and phone calls and endless cups of black coffee. He was running late for a dinner engagement at Le Bernardin, where he would be rubbing shoulders with some of the most powerful players in finance. And yet, as he stood there, staring out at the city below, Harrison couldn't shake the feeling that something was off.

He took a deep breath and turned away from the window, his eyes scanning the room for any sign of life. His assistant, Rachel, was busy typing away on her computer, oblivious to his distraction. He nodded curtly, knowing he needed to get moving if he wanted to make it to the restaurant on time.

But as he walked over to his desk, Harrison's gaze fell upon a small, unmarked package sitting on the edge of his blotter. It was wrapped in brown paper and twine, with no indication of who had sent it or what it might contain. A shiver ran down his spine as he picked it up, feeling an inexplicable sense of trepidation.

And then, just as he was about to turn away from it, Harrison noticed a small note attached to the package with a single word scrawled on it: "Wait."
