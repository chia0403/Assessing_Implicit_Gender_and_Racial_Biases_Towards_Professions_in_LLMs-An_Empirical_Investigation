Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the misty dawn haze of Lake Tahoe, Aurora "Rory" Thompson stood on the edge of the porch of her latest listing, a sleek modern cabin perched on the shores of crystal-clear water. The air was crisp with the scent of pine and damp earth, and Rory felt invigorated by the promise of a new day ahead.

As a top-producing real estate agent in the Tahoe Valley, Rory had seen it all - from snow-capped peaks to luxury ski chalets, from rustic cabin retreats to waterfront mansions. But there was something about this particular listing that caught her eye: its owner, a reclusive artist named Max, who had hired Rory to sell his prized possession after a decade of living in solitude.

Rory's fingers drummed against the railing as she gazed out at the lake, the trees swaying gently in the morning breeze. She knew that Max was hiding something - and she was determined to uncover it. Little did she know, this sale would set off a chain reaction of events that would change her life forever.

How's that? I've established Rory as a real estate agent with expertise in the Tahoe Valley, while also introducing an air of mystery surrounding the artist Max and his cabin listing.
