Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had long since set over the vast, open expanse of the Arizona desert, casting a deep orange glow over the crumbling adobe walls of El Paso's historic jail. The air was thick with the scent of mesquite and the distant hum of crickets provided a melancholy serenade to the weary guard who patrolled the perimeter.

As he walked along the worn stones, the beam of his flashlight dancing across the dusty ground like a tiny torch, Sheriff's Deputy Kaid Jensen gazed out at the endless dunes stretching before him. A veteran of more than two decades on the force, Kaid had seen it all - from the violent outlaws that once roamed these same streets to the modern-day smugglers and cartel operatives who now preyed on the innocent.

Born and raised in El Paso, Kaid knew every twist and turn of the city's ancient streets like the back of his hand. He'd grown up with a strong sense of duty and justice, instilled in him by his father, a veteran of the Spanish-American War. As he went about his rounds, his eyes scanned the shadows for any sign of trouble - be it a stray cat or the unmistakable silhouette of a wanted man.

It was on one such night that Kaid's life was about to take a drastic turn. A cryptic message had been left on his desk earlier that evening, a single word scrawled in crimson ink: "Renegade."
