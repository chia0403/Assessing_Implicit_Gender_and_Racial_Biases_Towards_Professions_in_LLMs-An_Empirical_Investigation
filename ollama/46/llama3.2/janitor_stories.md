Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the abandoned hospital, casting long shadows across the peeling linoleum floor. Amidst the decay and neglect, a lone figure pushed a rusty cart filled with cleaning supplies through the vacant corridors. His name was Elliot Theodore Thompson, but he preferred to go by Elliot. He had been working as a janitor at St. Michael's Hospital for over five years, watching as the once-thriving medical facility slowly fell into disrepair.

As he worked, Elliot couldn't shake the feeling that something was off about this particular night. The hospital's administration had sent him in early, citing some sort of "maintenance emergency" that required his attention. But as he made his way from room to room, sweeping and mopping with a practiced ease, Elliot began to notice strange inconsistencies in the hospital's layout. Doors seemed to be slightly ajar when he knew they shouldn't be, and the air was thick with an unsettling silence.

Elliot shrugged it off as nerves - after all, he'd grown accustomed to the hospital's quirks over the years. But deep down, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching him from the shadows, waiting for him to make a wrong move. Little did he know, this was only the beginning of a night that would change everything.

How's that?
