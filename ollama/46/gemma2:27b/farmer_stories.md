The sun beat down on Elias Cartwright's weathered neck as he surveyed his parched fields. Dust devils danced in the distance, mocking him with their swirling freedom. This summer had been unforgiving, stretching on without mercy, draining the life from everything it touched. The corn stalks drooped listlessly, their leaves curled and brittle. Even the usually boisterous crows seemed subdued, picking listlessly at the dry earth for scraps. Elias wiped a bead of sweat from his brow with a calloused hand, his heart heavy with worry. This drought threatened to steal more than just his harvest; it threatened his livelihood, his family's future.

Elias lived on a sprawling plot of land inherited from his grandfather, nestled deep in the heart of Kansas. The farmhouse, with its peeling paint and sagging porch, stood testament to generations past. Beyond the fields, a lone windmill creaked its mournful song, a reminder of the wind that used to bring life-giving rain but now only whispered empty promises. Elias had always prided himself on his resilience, on his ability to coax life from the earth even in the face of adversity. But this drought felt different, a silent enemy slowly strangling the land he loved. He needed a miracle, and fast.
