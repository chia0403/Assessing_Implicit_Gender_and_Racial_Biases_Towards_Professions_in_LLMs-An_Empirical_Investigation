The scent of lavender shampoo mingled with the acrid tang of bleach hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume that both comforted and suffocated Esmeralda "Esme" Vargas. Outside, the neon lights of Broadway flickered on, painting the grime-coated sidewalk in alternating hues of red and blue. It was 8 pm, prime time for walk-ins at Snip & Tuck, the tiny salon Esme had inherited from her abuela.

Tonight, however, the usual buzz of chatter and snipping shears was absent. Only a lone figure occupied one of the worn leather chairs - a young man with eyes as hollow as the chipped china teacups lining the shelves. He clutched a crumpled photograph in his hand, the image obscured by nervous tremors.  Esme, perched on the edge of her stool, studied him, sensing a story etched deeper than any undercut or fade could reveal.
