The aroma of lavender and disinfectant hung heavy in the air of Serenity Springs Rehabilitation Center, a scent Amelia Rose Thornton had come to associate with both hope and heartbreak.  Sunlight slanted through the floor-to-ceiling windows of the therapy gym, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path. Outside, autumn painted the Vermont hillsides in fiery hues of crimson and gold, a stark contrast to the pale, anxious faces Amelia saw every day. She adjusted the strap on her patient's shoulder, her touch gentle but firm.

"Remember," she said, her voice calm and reassuring, "slow and steady wins the race. Breathe with each movement."


The patient, a young man named Caleb whose leg had been shattered in a skiing accident, grimaced with effort as he lifted his weight onto the parallel bars. Amelia watched intently, noting the tremor in his hands, the way his gaze darted nervously around the room. She knew this was more than just physical rehabilitation for Caleb; it was about reclaiming his life, his dreams, and his sense of self-worth.

And Amelia Rose Thornton was determined to help him do just that.
