The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender and eucalyptus, a calming aroma intended to soothe frayed nerves before they even reached Dr. Evelyn Blackwood's treatment table. Sunlight streamed through the stained glass windowpane, casting kaleidoscopic patterns on the polished oak floor of her practice. Evelyn adjusted the angle of a vintage anatomical chart depicting the spine, its intricate vertebrae labelled with precision. Outside, the symphony of cicadas rose and fell with the afternoon heat wave blanketing the quaint seaside town of Havenwood. Despite the idyllic setting, a knot of tension tightened in Evelyn's stomach as she awaited her next patient. 

Today was different. Today, the man walking through her door carried more than just a crick in his neck. He carried a secret, one that threatened to unravel the carefully constructed life Evelyn had built for herself.
