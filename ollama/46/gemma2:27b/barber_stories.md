The flickering neon sign above Elias Bartholomew's barbershop buzzed erratically, casting a sickly green glow onto the rain-slicked cobblestones below.  A perpetual drizzle hung over the city of Veridian, clinging to the smog-choked air like a damp shroud. Inside, Elias meticulously sharpened his straight razor, its honed edge glinting under the dim bulb that swung precariously above his station. The shop smelled faintly of bay rum and stale tobacco – the comforting scent of generations past. Outside, the city groaned, a symphony of horns and clattering trams. But within the warm confines of Bartholomew's Barber Shop, time seemed to move at its own pace, measured by the slow scrape of the strop against steel and the rhythmic tick-tock of the grandfather clock in the corner. 


Elias paused, listening intently as the bell above the door chimed. A new customer was about to enter his domain – a domain where men shed their burdens along with their hair. Elias straightened his waistcoat, a wry smile playing on his lips. He knew that behind every face, there lay a story waiting to be told. And tonight, he felt, it would be a good one.
