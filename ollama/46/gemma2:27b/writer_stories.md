Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, each drop a tiny hammer blow against Eleanor Finch's concentration. She sighed, pushing back a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped its braid and was tickling her nose. The flickering gas lamp cast long shadows across the cluttered space, illuminating stacks of dusty manuscripts, overflowing inkwells, and a half-eaten plate of biscuits next to her typewriter. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, echoing the frustration gnawing at Eleanor's gut. 

She'd been stuck on this chapter for days, wrestling with a particularly stubborn plot twist that refused to cooperate. The heroine, a fiery young woman named Rosalind, needed a compelling reason to betray her own family â€“ but nothing Eleanor conjured felt authentic enough.
