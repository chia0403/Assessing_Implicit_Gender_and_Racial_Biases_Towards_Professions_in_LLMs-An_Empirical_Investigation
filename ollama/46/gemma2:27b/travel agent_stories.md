Rain lashed against the windowpane, mimicking the tempest brewing in Eloise Ainsworth's chest. Outside, London shivered under a November sky the color of pewter, but inside her cozy Notting Hill office, warmth emanated from the antique fireplace and Eloise's overflowing kettle.  

Eloise, with her fiery auburn hair often escaping its braid and eyes that sparkled like distant stars, wasn't one for dreary days. In fact, she thrived on sunshine and adventure, a trait that had led her to become a travel agent extraordinaire at "Wanderlust Escapes". Her office, cluttered with maps, postcards, and souvenirs from exotic locales, was a testament to her passion. Today, however, even the vibrant hues of Moroccan tapestries and intricate Indian silk scarves couldn't lift her spirits.

A phone call earlier that morning had delivered a blow, one that threatened to shatter Eloise's carefully constructed world. Her beloved grandmother, Nana Rose, the woman who instilled in her the insatiable thirst for exploration, was gravely ill. And she wanted Eloise by her side.
