The rain hammered against the warped windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Sinclair's office, mimicking the relentless ache in her chest. It had been three months since Michael, her husband of ten years, had walked out, leaving behind only a crumpled note and an echoing silence that threatened to consume her. 

Her office, nestled on the second floor of a quaint Victorian building overlooking a bustling city park, usually felt like a haven. The walls were painted a calming shade of sage green, adorned with framed botanical prints, and the air was always infused with the subtle scent of lavender oil from the diffuser she religiously kept running. But today, even the comforting familiarity couldn't quell the storm raging within her.

As Evelyn sat behind her mahogany desk, fingers tracing the worn edges of a well-thumbed copy of "Man's Search for Meaning," a sharp knock startled her. She composed herself, smoothing down the wrinkles on her linen blouse before calling out, "Come in."
