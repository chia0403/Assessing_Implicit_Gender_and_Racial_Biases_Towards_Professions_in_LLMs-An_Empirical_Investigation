Rain lashed against the glass doors of the Grand Blackwood Hotel, blurring the neon sign that flickered intermittently above them: "Luxury You Can Afford." Elara Thorne, her perfectly coiffed auburn bun starting to frizz in the humid air, sighed and straightened the stack of brochures on her mahogany desk. 

The lobby, usually bustling with tourists and businessmen, was eerily quiet tonight. The only sounds were the insistent drumming of rain and the faint, mournful melody drifting from the grand piano tucked away in a corner. Elara glanced at the clock â€“ nearly midnight.  She'd been alone for hours, her only company the occasional cockroach scurrying across the polished marble floor.

Tonight felt different. A prickle of unease ran down her spine.  It wasn't just the storm, though that certainly added to the unsettling atmosphere. There was something else, a subtle shift in the air, as if the hotel itself were holding its breath.
