Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the barn, each drop an insistent drumbeat against Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne's already frazzled nerves. The air inside was thick with the musk of hay and damp fur, a comforting smell under normal circumstances, but tonight it only amplified Amy's anxiety. Outside, the wind howled like a banshee, threatening to rip the old barn door from its hinges.  

Amy crouched beside Penelope, a skittish greyhound rescue who trembled violently at the storm's fury. "It's alright, girl," she murmured, stroking Penelope's silken ears. "Just a bit of thunder, nothing to be scared of." But even as she said the words, Amy couldn't help but glance nervously towards the barn's back corner where Jasper, a rescued pot-bellied pig with an alarmingly bad temper, grunted and snorted in his makeshift pen.  

Tonight was going to be a long one.
