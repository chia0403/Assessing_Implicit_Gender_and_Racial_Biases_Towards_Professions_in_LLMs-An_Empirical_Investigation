Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Theodore “Theo” Blackwood's office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into an Impressionist smear. Theo, his trench coat still damp from a fruitless stakeout earlier that evening, swirled the dregs of lukewarm coffee in his chipped mug. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarettes and despair – a familiar bouquet for anyone who dealt in the city's underbelly like Theo.

His phone buzzed on the cluttered desk, interrupting the symphony of rain and traffic. He snatched it up, grunting "Blackwood" into the receiver.  A clipped female voice on the other end requested his services, her tone hinting at both desperation and guarded secrecy. Intrigued, Theo leaned back in his creaky chair, a glimmer of hope flickering in his weary eyes. Perhaps tonight wouldn't be just another night drowning in shadows after all.
