Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Victorian mansion, each drop a tiny hammer blow against the ancient glass.  Inside, Eleanor Finch meticulously dusted a porcelain shepherdess, her movements precise and economical. The air hung heavy with the scent of lavender polish and damp wool carpets.  Eleanor knew this house like the back of her hand – its creaking floorboards, the hidden drafts that snaked through the hallways, the way sunlight slanted through the stained-glass window in the library each afternoon. For twenty years, she had been the unseen heart of Blackwood Manor, a silent guardian tending to its dust and shadows. Today, however, something felt different. A tension crackled in the air, thick as the fog rolling in from the sea. The family, the Blackwoods themselves, were due back any day, and this time, Eleanor sensed a change was coming – one that might sweep away the familiar quiet of her life.
