The aroma of crayons and Elmer's glue hung thick in the air, a familiar comfort to Ms. Eloise Beaumont, despite the fact that her stomach was currently doing somersaults. It was Open House night at Sunnyside Kindergarten, and twenty pairs of wide, curious eyes were fixated on her.  Eloise adjusted her floral blouse nervously, the plastic sunflowers pinned to it suddenly feeling too bright, too cheerful for the swirling anxiety within.

This wasn't just any Open House. Tonight marked Eloise's first year as lead teacher at Sunnyside, a position she'd dreamed of since childhood. But dreams, she was quickly discovering, didn't always account for the real-world butterflies that came with facing twenty sets of expectant parents.  

The kindergarten classroom buzzed with controlled chaos. Brightly colored construction paper covered walls adorned with lopsided handprints and crayon masterpieces. Miniature tables were scattered across the floor, each topped with bowls brimming with playdough and plastic dinosaurs.  Eloise took a deep breath, reminding herself to smile. This was her domain, her haven of tiny humans and boundless imagination.  She just had to convince their parents of that.
