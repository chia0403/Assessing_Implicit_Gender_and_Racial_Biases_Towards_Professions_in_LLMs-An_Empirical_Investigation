The midday sun beat down on Lucian Thorne's shoulders, turning his worn linen shirt into a damp rag. He squinted against the glare, sweat stinging his eyes as he chipped away at the rough block of granite before him. The air hung heavy with the scent of dust and freshly cut stone, a familiar perfume that Lucian had inhaled since childhood. His workshop, nestled on a cobbled lane in the heart of Stonemason's Quarter, vibrated with the rhythmic clang of his hammer against chisel.

Lucian wasn't carving some grand monument or elaborate sculpture today. This block was destined to become a simple tombstone, its surface soon to bear the name and dates of a departed soul. Yet, Lucian approached each piece with the same dedication, believing that even the humblest stone deserved to be treated with respect.
