The July sun beat down on Elias Finch's neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already hazy outline of the Victorian mansion he was working on. The ornate gingerbread trim, once a symbol of elegance, now resembled a crumbling honeycomb under the relentless assault of time and weather. Elias squinted, tracing the line where the rotten shingles met the solid oak frame, picturing in his mind's eye the precise angle he needed for the replacement.

He loved this part – the mental puzzle of each roof, figuring out the best way to weave new life into aging structures. It wasn't just about replacing shingles; it was about understanding the story etched into every weathered board, every rusting nail. This house, with its grand porches and intricate dormers, whispered tales of past inhabitants, their laughter echoing in the breeze that rustled through the ancient oak tree shading his work area.  

A loud crack echoed across the yard, startling Elias from his reverie. He glanced down to see a piece of rotten fascia crumbling away beneath his foot. The familiar pang of unease shot through him – a feeling he'd grown accustomed to in this line of work. Every roof held its own perils, and today felt particularly precarious.
