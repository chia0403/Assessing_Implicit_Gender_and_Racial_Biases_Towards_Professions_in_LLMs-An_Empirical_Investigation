The air in "Nails by Natalia" hummed with the low thrum of ceiling fans battling the August heat that seemed to seep through even the double-paned windows. Natalia Petrova, her silver bangles clinking softly against the polished mahogany table, surveyed her work. Mrs. Goldstein's nails, now a perfect French manicure, gleamed under the salon's fluorescent lights. 

"Beautiful, darling," Natalia chirped, holding up Mrs. Goldstein's hand for inspection. The older woman beamed, her wrinkles deepening in delight.  But even as Natalia accepted the generous tip and watched Mrs. Goldstein shuffle out the door, a familiar restlessness gnawed at her. This wasn't enough. She yearned for something more than perfectly shaped nails and gossip about the latest town drama. Natalia dreamed of escaping this small town, of painting canvases instead of fingernails, of letting her imagination run wild in vibrant colors instead of being confined by the muted palette of polish bottles.
