The scent of lavender and chamomile hung heavy in the air, battling for supremacy against the sharper tang of rubbing alcohol that perpetually permeated Elmwood Pharmacy. Eleanor Finch, her silver braid trailing down her back like a waterfall of moonlight, surveyed the shelves with a critical eye. Bottles shimmered under the warm glow of the overhead lamps, each containing a promise, a potion, or perhaps simply a placebo.

Outside, the rain hammered against the shop window, blurring the lights of the cobblestone street into an impressionistic painting. A lone figure huddled beneath a dripping awning across the way, their face obscured by the shadows. Elmwood was nestled in the heart of Oakhaven, a sleepy town where time seemed to move at its own languid pace, and secrets whispered on the wind.

Eleanor's fingers traced the worn spine of an ancient herbal encyclopedia. A shiver ran down her spine, not from the chill seeping through the drafty windowpanes, but from a premonition, a prickling sensation that something unusual was about to walk through her door.
