Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Nourish," Amelia Willowbrook's cozy nutrition clinic nestled in the heart of Asheville, North Carolina. The scent of lavender essential oil battled with the earthy aroma of damp leaves swirling outside, creating a uniquely calming atmosphere. Amelia, her auburn hair pulled back in a loose braid, tapped her pen against the notepad on her desk, frustration simmering beneath her calm facade.

Her latest client, a high-powered CEO battling chronic fatigue and insomnia, had dismissed her meticulously crafted meal plan with a wave of his hand. "Too much kale," he'd scoffed, preferring protein shakes and processed snacks that fueled his relentless work schedule but clearly weren't serving him well. Amelia sighed, wondering how to bridge the gap between scientific evidence and ingrained dietary habits.

The bell above the door chimed, announcing a new arrival. A gust of wind swept in with her client, carrying the scent of pine needles and something else... cinnamon?  Amelia looked up, curious, as a young woman tentatively stepped inside, shaking droplets from her rain-soaked auburn braid.
