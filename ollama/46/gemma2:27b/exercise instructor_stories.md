Palm trees swayed in the gentle breeze, casting dappled shadows on the turquoise pool below.  A string of fairy lights twinkled overhead, their glow barely piercing the encroaching twilight. This was her domain â€“ "Sunrise Fitness," Emilia's brainchild and passion project.

Emilia tapped the microphone nervously.  "Alright everyone," she called out, her voice amplified through the speakers. "Let's get started with some light cardio to warm up those muscles!" 


But even as she began leading them through a series of jumping jacks, Emilia couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The air crackled with an unusual energy, and a low rumble echoed in the distance, growing louder with each passing second.
