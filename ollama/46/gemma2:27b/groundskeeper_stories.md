The first tendrils of dawn were just beginning to paint the sky with strokes of pale apricot when Thaddeus Bartholomew Quince, head groundskeeper of Blackwood Manor, emerged from his cottage. A chill still clung to the air, making his breath puff out in white clouds as he surveyed his domain.

Blackwood Manor, a gothic behemoth of grey stone and crumbling turrets, loomed over the meticulously manicured gardens. Ivy, thick as pythons, snaked up its walls, their leaves tinged with the same autumnal hues that kissed the surrounding trees. Thaddeus, his weathered face creased with lines etched by years of sun and wind, felt a familiar pang of responsibility for this sprawling estate.  

He adjusted his tweed cap, its brim shading his piercing blue eyes, and walked towards the rose garden. The roses, still drowsy from the night, awaited their morning ritual â€“ a gentle misting, a careful pruning, and a soft serenade sung by Thaddeus himself. He believed they thrived best on his whispered poetry and stories of long-gone Blackwood residents.

But today, something felt different. A subtle shift in the air, a prickling sensation at the back of his neck. As he reached for his watering can, a crow landed on a nearby tombstone, its dark eyes fixated on him with unnerving intensity.  Thaddeus shivered, attributing it to the cold morning air.

Little did he know that this ordinary autumn day was about to become anything but.
