Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the Sunshine Daycare Center, mimicking the chaos brewing inside Elsie May Cartwright's head. The usual cacophony of giggles and sticky-fingered explorations was replaced by an unsettling silence punctuated only by the insistent ticking of the old clock on the wall. It was nap time, a sacred hour typically reserved for quiet breathing and the gentle rustling of blankets. Today, however, all five toddlers sat huddled in the corner, wide-eyed and trembling, staring at the darkened doorway leading to Ms. Eleanor's office. 

Elsie May knew something wasn't right.  Ms. Eleanor, with her sunshine yellow cardigans and bottomless supply of cookies, never locked her door during nap time. Something had spooked the children, and Elsie May, despite her own fluttering heart, knew she had to be their rock.
