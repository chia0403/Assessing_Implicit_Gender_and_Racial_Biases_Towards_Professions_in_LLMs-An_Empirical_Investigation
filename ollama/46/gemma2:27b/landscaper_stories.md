The July sun beat down on Elias Thorne's neck as he wrestled with the ancient rose bush, its gnarled branches resisting his pruning shears like arthritic fingers. Sweat slicked his forehead, stinging his eyes, but he persisted, muttering under his breath about "stubborn blooms" and "nature's defiance."  The air hung heavy with the scent of jasmine and freshly cut grass – a familiar perfume for Elias, who had spent most of his life coaxing beauty from the earth. 

He was crouched in the heart of Mrs. Hawthorne's rambling garden, a symphony of overgrown hedges, forgotten fountains, and riotous flowerbeds that spilled onto the cobblestone path. This Victorian mansion, perched precariously on the edge of a windswept cliff overlooking the tempestuous Atlantic Ocean, was Elias' latest project – a challenge he relished. 

But today, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he glimpsed movement out of the corner of his eye. Turning, he scanned the overgrown tangle of ivy and roses, searching for the source of the disturbance. The wind rustled the leaves, mocking his apprehension with a whispered sigh.

Was it just the heat playing tricks on him? Or was there something else lurking within the shadows of this once-grand estate?
