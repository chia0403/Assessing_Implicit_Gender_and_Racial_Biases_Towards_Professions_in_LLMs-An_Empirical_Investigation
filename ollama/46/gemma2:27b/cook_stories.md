The air in the kitchen hung heavy with the scent of caramelizing onions and simmering garlic.  Heat radiated from the ancient stove, its enamel chipped and scarred like an old warrior's face. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Prague echoed with the clatter of horse-drawn carriages and the distant strains of a street musician's violin. Inside, Emilia Novak, her brow furrowed in concentration, deftly wielded her well-worn wooden spoon, stirring a pot of goulash bubbling merrily on the stove. The late afternoon sun streamed through the grime-coated window, casting long shadows across the worn floorboards and illuminating dust motes dancing in the golden light.  Emilia paused, taking a deep breath, inhaling the symphony of aromas filling her tiny kitchen. It was a scent that spoke of home, of comfort, of generations past – a scent she hoped would one day draw customers back to her struggling restaurant, "U Zlatého Husa" - The Golden Goose.
