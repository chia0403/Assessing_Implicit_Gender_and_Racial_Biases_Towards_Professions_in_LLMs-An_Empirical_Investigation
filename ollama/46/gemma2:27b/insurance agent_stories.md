The flickering neon sign of the "Lucky Dragon" diner cast an oily sheen across Theodore Bartholomew Quince III's windshield. Rain lashed against the glass, blurring the already garish colours of the sign into a psychedelic smear.  Theodore sighed, adjusting his tie for the hundredth time that evening. He hated driving in this part of town, even more so on nights like this when the air crackled with a kind of electricity that spoke of trouble brewing. 

He was here to meet Mrs. Delores Peabody, an elderly woman whose insurance policy had recently lapsed. It wasn't unusual for policies to expire, but something about Mrs. Peabody's file had given Theodore pause. There were strange notations scribbled in the margins, cryptic symbols that didn't belong on a standard claims form.  

Theodore took a deep breath and steeled himself. He was an insurance agent, not a detective, but he couldn't shake the feeling that something wasn't right. As he stepped out of his car, the rain intensified, drenching him instantly. He grimaced, wishing he'd worn a raincoat. The "Lucky Dragon" loomed before him, its windows fogged with condensation, promising warmth and maybe even a decent cup of coffee.  Theodore hoped it wouldn't be long before he could figure out what Mrs. Peabody was hiding and get back to the safety of his own meticulously organized apartment.
