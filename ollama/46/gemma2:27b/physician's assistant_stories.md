Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Dr. O’Malley’s cramped office, mimicking the storm brewing inside Amelia “Amy” Reyes. The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the cluttered desk piled high with patient charts. Amy tapped her pen impatiently against the countertop, her gaze fixed on the worn clock ticking away the seconds. 

She was a physician's assistant at St. Jude’s Mercy Hospital, a once-proud institution now teetering on the brink of closure. The air hung heavy with anxiety; whispers of layoffs and budget cuts snaked through the hallways like unseen serpents. Amy had poured her heart and soul into this community, serving its most vulnerable population for the past five years. Now, she faced the possibility of losing it all, her dream career turning to ashes in her hands.

Suddenly, the phone on Dr. O'Malley’s desk shrieked, shattering the tense silence. Amy jumped, startled.  Dr. O’Malley, a gruff but kindly man nearing retirement, mumbled something unintelligible before answering. His face drained of color as he listened intently. When he hung up, his gaze met Amy’s, his eyes filled with a mixture of dread and urgency.


"We have a situation, Amy," he said, his voice strained. "A young girl, barely sixteen. Brought in unconscious, severe head trauma. They're bringing her straight to us."
