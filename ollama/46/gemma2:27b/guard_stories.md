The wind shrieked down from Mount Cindertooth, clawing at the rough-hewn stone walls of Greyhaven Citadel. Rain lashed against the narrow window slits in Corvus Blackwood's watchtower, blurring the already hazy outline of the treacherous mountain pass below. He huddled deeper into his threadbare cloak, the damp chill seeping through to his bones. Every muscle ached from hours spent standing guard. 

Corvus, with his grizzled beard flecked with snow and eyes that held the wisdom of countless winters, was no stranger to hardship. For twenty years he had stood watch over Greyhaven, protecting the last bastion of civilization against the horrors that lurked in the shadow of Cindertooth. Today, however, the wind carried a different chill - a whisper of unease that prickled at his senses like frostbite.

Something was amiss...
