The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the stacks of petri dishes lining Dr. Eleanor Vance's workbench. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down relentlessly, but inside the lab at the Biosphere Institute, the air hung cool and damp, thick with the scent of agar and disinfectant. Eleanor squinted through her microscope, meticulously recording data on a peculiar strain of algae she’d isolated from a Martian meteorite sample.

The key to terraforming Mars, unlocking the secrets of extraterrestrial biology?
