The diner's fluorescent lights hummed above Esmeralda "Esme" Jones, casting a sickly yellow glow over the cracked vinyl booths and greasy counter. Outside, the Arizona sun beat down on the asphalt, turning the air into a shimmering mirage. Esme shifted uncomfortably in her booth, the vinyl sticking to her denim overalls. She'd been parked at this rest stop for hours, waiting out a sandstorm that had rolled in with surprising ferocity. 

Her rig, a hulking Peterbilt christened "The Phoenix," sat silent outside, its chrome glinting dully under the oppressive sky. Esme sipped her lukewarm coffee, her gaze drifting towards the highway. It stretched endlessly before her, a ribbon of grey swallowed by the swirling dust devil in the distance.  She missed the open road, the endless hum of her engine, and the feeling of freedom that came with hauling cargo across the vast American landscape. 

But today, something felt different. A gnawing unease settled in her stomach, a premonition she couldn't quite shake. The sandstorm was just the beginning, she could feel it. Something bigger, darker, was brewing on the horizon.
