The neon sign outside buzzed erratically, casting flickering green light across Elara Thorne's tired face. "Burger Bliss," it proclaimed in bold, bubbly letters, a cruel joke considering the misery simmering within its greasy walls. Elara sighed, tugging at her starched uniform blouse – already stained with ketchup from an earlier mishap – and adjusted the plastic name tag that read "Elara" in chipped, black font. The smell of stale fries and overworked grills hung heavy in the air, a scent she'd come to associate with despair rather than deliciousness. 


Tonight was shaping up to be another long one. A busload of rambunctious teenagers had just arrived, their laughter echoing through the diner like a pack of feral wolves. Elara braced herself for the inevitable onslaught of spilled milkshakes, forgotten orders, and demands for extra pickles. She longed for something more – a life beyond the endless loop of burgers, fries, and forced smiles. But for now, she was trapped in Burger Bliss, waiting to be devoured by another hungry night.
