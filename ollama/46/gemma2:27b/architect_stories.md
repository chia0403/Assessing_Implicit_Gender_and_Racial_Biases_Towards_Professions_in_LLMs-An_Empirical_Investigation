Rain lashed against the skylights of Eleanor Vance's studio, mimicking the frantic drumming in her chest. Blueprints lay scattered across the drafting table, each line blurring into another under the weight of Eleanor's frustration. The project, a community center for the struggling seaside town of Oakhaven, was proving to be more challenging than anticipated.

Eleanor, with her fiery auburn hair perpetually escaping its bun and eyes that sparkled with both brilliance and weariness, loved nothing more than crafting spaces that breathed life into communities. But Oakhaven's limited budget, coupled with conflicting demands from the townspeople – a playground for the children, a library for the elders, a performance space for the aspiring artists – felt like an impossible puzzle.


The salty air drifted in through the open windows, carrying with it the cries of gulls and the mournful groan of a distant foghorn. Outside, Oakhaven hunched under a bruised sky, its faded Victorian houses clinging to the windswept cliffs like weathered barnacles. Eleanor's studio, perched atop one such cliff, offered a panoramic view of the tumultuous sea below, mirroring the turmoil within her own mind.
