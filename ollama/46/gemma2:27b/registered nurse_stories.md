Rain lashed against the grimy windows of St. Jude's Hospital, mirroring the storm raging within Amelia Rosalind Thorne. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an anemic glow on the linoleum floor and reflecting off her perpetually damp scrubs.  The smell of antiseptic mingled with the sickly sweet scent of disinfectant, a familiar perfume that usually calmed Amelia's nerves. Tonight, however, it did little to soothe the knot in her stomach.

She was supposed to be celebrating tonight. After five grueling years of study and countless hours spent hunched over textbooks, she had finally passed her nursing boards and become a fully registered nurse. Yet, instead of feeling elation, Amelia felt an overwhelming sense of dread. Her first shift on the night ward of St. Jude's – notorious for its high-risk patients and overworked staff – loomed before her like a dark thundercloud.
