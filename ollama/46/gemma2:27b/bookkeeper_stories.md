Rain lashed against the grimy windows of "Grimes & Grumbles," blurring the neon glow of the pawn shop across the street. Inside, Penelope Ainsworth hunched over her ledger, the faint scent of stale coffee and old paper clinging to the air. The rhythmic click-clack of her adding machine was the only sound besides the relentless drumming of rain. 

Penelope wasn't your typical bookkeeper. She preferred the company of numbers to people, finding solace in the neat rows and columns that revealed a story hidden within each transaction. Yet, tonight, even the familiar comfort of figures couldn't soothe her unease. A series of increasingly irregular entries from "The Gilded Cage," the notorious speakeasy she meticulously tracked for Mr. Grimes, had sparked a gnawing suspicion in her gut.  Something was amiss, something far more unsettling than simple fudged numbers.
