The air conditioner wheezed, struggling against the relentless August heat radiating through Elara Sinclair's tiny Brooklyn apartment window. Sunlight bounced off her cluttered desk, illuminating the half-finished logo design for a new artisanal pickle company on her computer screen. The garish green she'd chosen for the jar lid clashed violently with the font, making her eyes water.

"Ugh," Elara groaned, pushing back from her desk and massaging her temples. Freelance graphic design was a fickle beast, rewarding creativity one minute and leaving you staring blankly at a pickle jar the next.  She needed inspiration, something to jolt her out of this creative rut. Maybe a walk through Prospect Park? Or a double espresso from that hipster coffee shop down the street with the questionable name?

Suddenly, a piercing buzz ripped through the quiet hum of the apartment. It was coming from her phone, flashing a message on the screen: “URGENT PROJECT – CALL ASAP”.  It was from Ms. Evangeline Davenport, Elara’s most eccentric and demanding client. The pickle company could wait. This smelled like something big.
