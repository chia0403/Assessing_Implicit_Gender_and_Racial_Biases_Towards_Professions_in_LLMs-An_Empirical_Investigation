The bell above the door chimed merrily, announcing Elara Primrose's first customer of the day. It was barely past dawn, the light outside still pale and hesitant, but already the air in "Primrose & Bloom" was thick with the scent of roses, lilies, and freshly cut lavender. Elara, her auburn hair tied back in a loose braid, smiled warmly at the woman who entered, her face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat and a long woolen coat. 

The shop itself was a haven of vibrant colour nestled amongst the grey stone buildings of Edinburgh's Old Town. Sunlight streamed through the large arched windows, illuminating rows upon rows of blooms arranged in artful bouquets and whimsical displays. Dried herbs hung from the ceiling, their earthy aroma mingling with the sweet perfume of the flowers. A gentle melody played softly on the antique gramophone tucked away in a corner, adding to the shop's air of cozy enchantment.


This was Elara's sanctuary â€“ a world she had painstakingly built over the last five years. Each bloom, each carefully chosen vase, spoke volumes about her passion for nature's artistry and her deep-seated desire to bring joy into the lives of others.

But today, something felt different. The air hung heavy with an unspoken anticipation. The woman in the hat stood silently, her gaze fixed on a single crimson rose displayed prominently in a crystal vase by the window. Elara felt a shiver run down her spine, a feeling she couldn't quite place.
