Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Elias Thorne's shop, blurring the already fading light of dusk into an oily smear. The wind howled like a banshee down the narrow cobblestone street, rattling the sign that creaked above his door: "Thorne & Needle - Purveyors of Fine Garments." Inside, Elias was hunched over his workbench, the warm glow of the oil lamp illuminating a sea of shimmering silks and velvets. His nimble fingers danced across a bolt of crimson brocade, carefully measuring and marking the fabric for a gown destined for Lady Elmsworth's upcoming ball.

The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his needle against the cloth was usually a balm to Elias' soul, a comforting counterpoint to the cacophony of the city outside. But tonight, a gnawing unease twisted in his gut. He couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss. The whispers in the marketplace about strange occurrences had reached even his secluded corner of the city. Talk of flickering lights, disembodied voices, and shadows moving with unnatural speed left him chilled to the bone.


Elias longed for the simplicity of a world where such things were relegated to campfire stories and drunken ramblings. He was a man of fabric and thread, his life woven into the delicate tapestry of everyday routines. Yet, as the storm raged on, threatening to tear down the very walls of his shop, he couldn't help but wonder if there wasn't more to the world than met the eye.
