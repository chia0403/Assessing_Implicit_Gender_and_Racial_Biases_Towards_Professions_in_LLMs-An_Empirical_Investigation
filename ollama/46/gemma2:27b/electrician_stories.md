Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the workshop, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display. The air hung thick with the metallic tang of ozone and the oily scent of aged machinery. Elias Finch, his calloused hands stained ochre from days spent wrestling with ancient wiring, surveyed the mess before him. A tangle of wires, frayed insulation, and mismatched connectors lay strewn across his workbench, remnants of a century-old electrical system he was attempting to coax back to life. 

He squinted at the faded blueprints spread out beside him, muttering under his breath about "devilish diagrams" and "whimsical wiring." Elias wasn't known for his patience. He preferred the clean lines and predictable logic of modern circuitry, but this rambling Victorian manor house had its own stubborn charm â€“ and a desperate owner who insisted on preserving its antiquated soul.
