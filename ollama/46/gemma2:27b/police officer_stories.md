Rain lashed against the grimy windows of the precinct, each drop exploding in a miniature firework display on the cracked asphalt below. The air hung thick with the smell of stale coffee and desperation, a scent Detective Elias “Eli” Blackwood had come to know intimately in his ten years on the force.  Tonight, however, even the familiar stench couldn't mask the cloying metallic tang that had seeped into the room – the unmistakable odor of blood. 

Eli ran a hand through his already disheveled hair, wincing as the fluorescent lights above reflected off the dark circles under his eyes. He hadn’t slept properly in days, not since the body was found dumped in an alley behind the Sapphire Lounge.  The victim, a young woman named Isabella Reyes, had been strangled, her delicate features contorted in a mask of silent terror. Eli stared at the crime scene photos spread across his desk – Isabella's lifeless eyes, staring accusingly into the void.

He knew this case was different. It wasn't just the brutal nature of the crime; it was the chilling sense of familiarity that gnawed at him, like a half-remembered nightmare.
