Rain lashed against the panoramic windows of Alistair Montgomery Cavendish's office on the 42nd floor. The city below, usually a glittering tapestry of lights, was now obscured by a swirling grey curtain. A low rumble of thunder echoed through the glass and steel behemoth that housed Cavendish Enterprises, a multinational corporation Alistair had built from the ground up. He sat at his mahogany desk, the polished surface reflecting the flickering neon sign of a nearby bar â€“ a beacon of normalcy in this tempestuous night. His face, usually etched with the sharp lines of determination, was creased with worry. 

Alistair wasn't concerned about the storm raging outside. He faced a different kind of tempest - one brewing within his own company. A leak had sprung, revealing sensitive information about an upcoming merger to a rival firm.  The consequences could be catastrophic, threatening not only the deal but also Cavendish Enterprises' hard-earned reputation.
