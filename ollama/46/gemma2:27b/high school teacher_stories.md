Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Vance's classroom, mimicking the relentless drumbeat in her chest. The fluorescent lights hummed above, casting a sickly yellow glow on the empty desks, each one reflecting Eleanor's own anxiety back at her. It was 7:58 pm, two minutes before the start of her evening tutoring session with Michael, a struggling sophomore who seemed to find solace in the world of numbers but stumbled when faced with the complexities of the English language.

Eleanor wasn’t worried about Michael. She worried about what lay beyond these classroom walls, beyond the familiar comfort of dusty textbooks and worn-out grammar guides. Tonight was different. Tonight, she would finally confront him – her estranged brother, Liam, who lived just a few blocks away, a constant reminder of a past she desperately wanted to forget.
