The flickering fluorescent lights of Maplewood Elementary buzzed like agitated hornets, casting long shadows across Dr. Eleanor Vance's cluttered desk. A half-eaten bagel sat perched precariously on a teetering stack of student files, next to a chipped mug holding lukewarm coffee. Outside her window, the playground echoed with the boisterous shouts of children, a stark contrast to the quiet tension that hung heavy in Eleanor's cramped office. 

She sighed, pushing away the file labelled "Ethan Miller - Behavioral Issues." Ethan was just one piece of a puzzle she couldn't seem to solve â€“ a recurring pattern of anxiety and disruptive behavior plaguing several students at Maplewood. Something felt off, deeper than the usual pre-teen angst or playground squabbles. 

Eleanor leaned forward, her gaze fixed on the worn photograph taped to her monitor. A younger Eleanor beamed back, her arm slung around a giggling group of children at summer camp. Back then, she'd dreamt of making a difference, one child at a time. Now, staring at the worried faces in Ethan's file, she wondered if that dream had become too distant.
