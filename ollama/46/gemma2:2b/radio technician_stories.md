## The Static in the Silence

**Setting:** A decaying lighthouse on the wind-battered coast of Cape Horn.  The year is 1963.  The salty air bites, carrying the constant, low thrum of the North Atlantic.

**Character:** Evelyn "Eve" Thorne, a woman hardened by years of battling the elements and her own internal storms. Her calloused hands are a testament to a life spent tinkering with radios, coaxing them back to life with a stubborn patience that borders on genius. 


Evelyn perched precariously atop the weathered radio tower, its rusted metal groaning in protest under her weight.  The wind whipped her hair around her face as she squinted at the static-filled screen of the transmitter.  A frustrated groan escaped her lips as the signal wavered between a cacophony of static and intermittent bursts of unintelligible interference. 

It was supposed to be a routine check, a simple transmission to relay weather reports from the nearby research vessel "Aurora" to the mainland.  But these isolated stretches of land were notorious for their unpredictable nature, often spitting out more static than meaningful signals.  Eve knew better than anyone the dance with radio waves - an almost mystical exchange between technology and nature's relentless pushback. 

She clutched the worn wrench in her hand, its familiar feel a comfort against the unforgiving wind. Today, though, even the wrench felt like a burden. The silence pressed on Eve like a heavy cloak, broken only by the howling of the sea and the mournful creak of the tower itself. 


Evelyn had lost something that day.  She'd come to this desolate lighthouse seeking solace after the loss of her husband, Arthur, in a storm five years earlier. But now, amidst the deafening silence, she felt more alone than ever.
