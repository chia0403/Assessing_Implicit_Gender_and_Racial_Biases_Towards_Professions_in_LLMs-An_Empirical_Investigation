##  Story Opening: 

Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Alistair Thorne's office in the bustling heart of London. The storm, mirroring the turmoil brewing inside him, churned with an almost unnatural ferocity. Outside, sirens wailed like a chorus of lamenting souls, but within the confines of his cramped study, the only sound was the relentless tick-tock of the grandfather clock on the wall â€“ each pulse a reminder of time slipping away. 

Alistair Thorne, renowned cardiothoracic surgeon and professor at St. Thomas' Hospital, stared blankly into the swirling mist captured in his antique magnifying glass. The case files lay open before him, each page filled with familiar, yet deeply unsettling details: another young patient succumbed to a rare and elusive heart condition, leaving Alistair questioning not only his medical abilities but also the very fabric of reality. Was he losing grip on the world's most intricate workings? Or was something far more sinister at play within his own mind? 

**Setting:** A small office apartment above a bustling London bakery, overlooking an old cobbled street in the vibrant heart of Kensington. The room is cluttered with medical texts and equipment, and the air hangs heavy with the smell of aged leather and fresh-baked bread from the downstairs bakery.
