The crisp morning air of Elmshaven carried the scent of pine needles and damp earth.  Dust motes danced in the pale sunlight that pierced through the dusty windows of Agnes Thorne's workshop. It was one of those days when even the most seasoned craftsman would admit to needing a stiff drink, but Agnes found solace in the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her needle against thread. Her nimble fingers were as familiar with intricate patterns and delicate silks as they were with the rough wood of her antique sewing machine. 

Agnes Thorne was more than just a tailor – she was the weaver of dreams. With each stitch, each carefully measured curve of fabric, she crafted not just clothes but stories. Tonight, however, she would be weaving a tale of love and loss – a wedding dress for young Clara Thornton, her first commission in years. The once-vibrant colours of the satin now dulled under the weight of unspoken grief, mirroring Agnes’ own heavy heart.
