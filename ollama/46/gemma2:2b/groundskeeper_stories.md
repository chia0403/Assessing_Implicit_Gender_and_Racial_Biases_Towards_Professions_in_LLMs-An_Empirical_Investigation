The air in Willow Creek was thick with both humidity and secrets.  A mist clung to the gnarled branches of the ancient oaks that lined Elmwood Lane, their leaves whispering through the stillness like hushed confessions. This was where Thomas "Tom" Blackwood resided, tending his little patch of paradise within the sprawling estate of Lord Sterling. He wasn't much for gossip or intrigue – Tom preferred the company of earth and his carefully tended roses to the intrigues of his neighbors. For years, he’d nurtured the grounds here at Elmwood with a meticulous care that bordered on obsession, but even he couldn't help feeling the unsettling hum emanating from the manor house.

Tom was about as ordinary as a man could get - broad-shouldered and tanned from endless sun, with hands calloused and scarred from years of working the earth.  His face, weathered like old bark, bore a permanent frown. A thick patch of dark hair hid his forehead, giving him the appearance of a silent guardian of this verdant sanctuary. He’d been here since he was a boy, following in his father's footsteps – tending to the flowers and keeping the grounds safe from any intruders. But lately, an unwelcome sense of unease clung to him like morning dew on spiderwebs.  It had started with the whispers: murmurings about strange lights flickering within the walls, about hidden passages, and a secret that Lord Sterling himself couldn't bear to divulge.
