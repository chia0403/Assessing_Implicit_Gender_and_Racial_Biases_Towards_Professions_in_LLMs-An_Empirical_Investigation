The air in "Serenity & Serenity," a floral boutique with an aroma that clung stubbornly to lavender and rose petals, was thick enough to cut with a knife.  Eleanor "Ellie" Sterling sighed as she glanced at the clock on the wall. 7:17 AM. The shop had opened only an hour ago, but already the morning bustle was starting to pick up.  A steady stream of customers flowed in, each bringing their own unique kind of stress and quiet desperation with them.  Ellie, a veteran receptionist, navigated the chaos with practiced ease.  Her smile, though strained at times, held a constant flicker of warmth that seemed to reassure even the most anxious of her clients.

The world outside was just starting its daily dance: birds chirping in the otherwise silent street; the distant hum of traffic beginning to snake through the city's arteries. A soft drizzle began to fall from the sky, adding to the melancholic symphony of the morning. Ellie watched as a young woman, her face crumpled with worry, stepped into the shop, clutching a crumpled piece of paper. The world was about to get a lot more complicated for her, and Ellie had just begun to understand how much this would all cost.
