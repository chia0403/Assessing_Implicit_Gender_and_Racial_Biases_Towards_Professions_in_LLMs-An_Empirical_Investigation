He sat inside, the only sounds the rhythmic hum of his engine and the occasional crackle from his CB radio.  He flicked a switch on the dashboard, activating the built-in GPS that marked his route with precise accuracy, each mile a testament to the unwavering trust he placed in this mechanical beast.
