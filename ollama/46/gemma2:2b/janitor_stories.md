The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune as Samuel "Sam" Thompson, the custodian of Building C at the State University, meticulously swept the worn linoleum floors. A scent of stale coffee and dust hung heavy in the air, an olfactory signature of the building's inhabitants – students consumed by their studies or entangled in late-night raucous celebrations. 

The year was 1985, a time when shoulder pads were king, MTV ruled the airwaves, and vinyl records held sway over cassette tapes. Sam, however, lived in the gray humdrum of his routine.  His hands – calloused and worn from years of scrubbing and polishing – moved with practiced precision, oblivious to the symphony of life unfolding beyond the grimy walls of Building C. 

Today, though, a strange, almost unsettling feeling clung to the air, like a forgotten melody clinging to the echo chamber of his mop bucket.  Sam couldn't quite place it, but he knew this wasn't just another Tuesday night at the university.
