Rain hammered against the grimy windows of Detective Rhys "Righteous" Thornton's office, blurring the neon glow of the city outside into an abstract mess of colors. A constant rumble echoed from somewhere below, likely another night of sirens and shouting â€“ the symphony of urban decay that was his life's soundtrack.  Righteous leaned back in his worn leather armchair, a half-empty whiskey glass warming his calloused hand. He rubbed his face, tired eyes reflecting the neon hues struggling to pierce through the gloom. The case file lay open on his battered wooden desk - the only thing saving the faded photograph of a young woman from being swallowed whole by the darkness. It was all he had left of Elsie Thorne, her life tragically cut short just weeks ago. 

Elsie's death wasn't just another unsolved mystery for Righteous; it was an echo of his own past. A past shrouded in smoke and shadows, a secret he'd carried since before he even knew the meaning of 'detective'. The case, if anything could be called that, seemed to have taken on a life of its own, pushing him toward answers he had long buried.
