The rain hammered against the leaded glass windows of Dr. Evelyn Thorne's office, each drop a tiny explosion of sound in the otherwise silent room. Outside, Seattle was drowning in a grey curtain of storm clouds; even the sky itself seemed to mirror Evelyn's melancholic mood. She stared at the ceiling, the faint glow of her therapy lamp offering a meager solace against the overwhelming sense of emptiness that had settled over her. For ten years, she’d dedicated herself to helping others navigate the labyrinthine depths of human emotions, yet she felt hopelessly lost in her own internal landscape. 

Evelyn Thorne, M.D., Ph.D., Clinical Psychologist, was known for her expertise in trauma recovery and a compassionate demeanor that allowed even the most hardened patients to open up.  But lately, even her practiced empathy had begun to wear thin. The weight of countless shared pain points - loss, fear, betrayal - was starting to leave its mark on her soul. She couldn’t shake the feeling that she, like her clients, was trapped in an inescapable cycle of hurt and healing. 

Her mind drifted back to her late husband, David. He had been her anchor, her guiding star. His sudden passing six months ago, a senseless act of violence that shattered their life's trajectory, had left her adrift. Now, she found herself battling not just the ghosts of her grief but also the nagging fear that her own light was fading, dimming amidst the ever-present darkness.
