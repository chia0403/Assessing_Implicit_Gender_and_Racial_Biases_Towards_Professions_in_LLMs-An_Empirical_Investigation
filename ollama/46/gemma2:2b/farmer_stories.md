The sun was already dipping below the horizon, painting the fields with strokes of fiery orange and bruised purple. A chill wind stirred through the wheat stalks, sending a shiver down Elara Blackwoodâ€™s spine despite her thick woolen coat.  Elara squinted at the barn door as she pulled a worn leather satchel from her hip, its weight a familiar comfort against her thigh. This was always the hardest part of the evening, separating herself from the farm and the gentle but constant hum of work.

The Blackwood farm was more than just land; it was a tapestry woven with the threads of years, sweat, and resilience.  Elara's grandfather had taught her to read the language of the soil, its ebb and flow reflected in the rhythm of the seasons. Now, Elara carried on that legacy, tending to her fields like an alchemist, coaxing life from the earth with a touch as gentle as it was firm. 

Tonight, though, even the familiar sway of the wheat seemed to whisper of unease. A strange stillness had settled upon the farm, and the normally vibrant cries of robins were muted. The usual symphony of nature felt strangely subdued. Elara tightened her grip on the satchel, a knot forming in her stomach. Tonight was the night she would speak with the old woman, the one who lived beyond the whispers of wind and the boundaries of time itself.  

The Old Woman lived at the edge of Blackwood's Fields, shrouded in tales whispered by generations of farmers. Some called her a witch, others a mystic, but Elara knew only that she carried answers to mysteries no textbook could unravel.
