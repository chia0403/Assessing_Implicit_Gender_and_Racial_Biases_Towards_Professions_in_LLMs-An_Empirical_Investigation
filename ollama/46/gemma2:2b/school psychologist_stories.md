## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  Stonecliffe High School - a sprawling building in the heart of a bustling industrial city. 

The year was 2047, and Stonecliffe stood proud amidst the grimy steel and concrete canyons that surrounded it. Inside, however, a different kind of landscape played out: one of anxieties, whispered rumors, and the ever-present hum of hidden struggles.  Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Reed, head school psychologist at Stonecliffe for the past five years, surveyed the scene from her office on the third floor.

She'd seen it all: the weight of first crushes, the crushing despair of family illness, the silent struggle of a student who just *knew* something was wrong but couldn't quite put it into words.  Ellie’s own quiet voice often felt like a whisper against the din of teenage emotions, seeking understanding in a sea of chaos. She knew each hallway, each stairwell, every corner where a student might be lost or found.

Today, however, something was different. A palpable unease hung thick in the air, even as the usual cacophony of locker slams and whispered conversations filled the hallways. Ellie watched a lone figure pacing outside her office door – a boy she'd met once before, but whose name she couldn't quite recall.  He shifted his weight from one foot to another, his eyes darting back and forth, and for some reason, Ellie felt compelled to call him in.
