The air hung thick with the perfume of jasmine blossoms and freshly baked bread.  Cassian Thorne, known to everyone as Cas, navigated the bustling grand entrance hall of The Astorian, a hotel so opulent it seemed carved from dreams. Sunlight filtered through stained-glass windows depicting scenes of Parisian life in hues that rivaled the city's own twilight palette.  As he smoothed the silk scarf around his neck and glanced at the ornate clock face, Cas couldn't help but feel a familiar pang of loneliness. 

He was the concierge, the unseen architect of comfort within these gilded walls. He'd known each nook and cranny, each creak and whisper, since he started here five years ago. His world was a tapestry woven from hushed conversations, secret requests, and the unspoken desires hidden behind elegant smiles. Yet, his own heart yearned for something more than the predictable rhythm of luxury and servitude. Cas longed to break free, to discover the stories beyond the polished surfaces of The Astorian. 


He glanced at the hotel's resident artist, a young woman named Elise whose canvases depicted a fiery intensity that mirrored the city's pulse.  Cas saw in her art a reflection of his own longing - for connection, for something real amidst the artificial beauty of The Astorian's world. Today, heâ€™d be meeting a new guest. A visitor with secrets as deep and dark as the midnight sky. As Cas prepared to greet him at the grand staircase, he couldn't shake the feeling that this man would change everything.
