The air hung thick and humid in the tiny town of Oakhaven, nestled between rolling farmland and a sun-drenched lake. The only sound besides cicadas buzzing in the twilight was the incessant creaking of Mrs. Peabody's rickety porch swing as she watched her prize irises sway in the breeze. For Amelia Thorne, real estate agent extraordinaire, this scene was a familiar symphony.

Her clients, the Millers, were a couple on the brink of their forever, hoping to find a place in Oakhaven as charming and lasting as they were. Amelia had taken them through countless homes in the last two weeks, each one more picturesque than the last, but something about this house, its faded paint and peeling wallpaper, held a peculiar charm.  It was a whisper of stories waiting to be told, of lives lived and lost within those four walls.
