The scent of sawdust clung to Elias's worn leather apron as he surveyed the chaos unfolding in his workshop. It was 3 am, the air thick with an unsettling stillness that only amplified the symphony of hammering echoing from inside the unfinished cabin. A half-built table lay against a wall, its rough-hewn surface promising comfort, yet leaving Elias feeling strangely unsettled.  

Elias Thornewood, known throughout Oakhaven for his sturdy work and quiet demeanor, had a knack for transforming raw wood into something beautiful, something that whispered tales of strength and resilience. Yet, this cabin was different. The project had been commissioned by Amelia Cartwright, a widow whose grief for her late husband seemed as deep as the forest shadows that cloaked their small town. 

Oakhaven itself was nestled amongst rolling hills, its silence punctuated only by the distant chirping of crickets and the rhythmic flow of the nearby creek. It was a place where time moved slower, where whispers were shared on the wind, and stories lived and breathed within the very wood of old trees. But even in this tranquil haven, something felt off. The air held a trace of sadness, a lingering sorrow that seemed to seep from every creak of the floorboards and sigh of the wind against the windowpanes.
