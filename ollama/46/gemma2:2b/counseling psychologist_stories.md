The crisp November air bit at Dr. Eleanor Reed's cheeks as she stepped through the front door of Serenity Counseling, its paint chipped like the memories it held. Inside, the aroma of sandalwood incense mingled with the scent of old books and paper, a comforting familiarity for anyone seeking solace in the chaotic world beyond.  Eleanor had grown accustomed to the silence that followed the bustle of the day's appointments, a gentle hum of whispered hopes and shared anxieties that reverberated through each room like a soft symphony. This was her haven, where she could weave stories out of lives she barely understood, offering guidance and empathy to those who found themselves lost in their own narratives.

Today, however, felt different. The air hung heavy with an unspoken tension, the silence crackling like dry leaves on a windswept hill. Eleanor's gaze drifted towards the waiting room, drawn by the familiar figure of Mrs. Thompson, her face etched with worry lines that spoke of sleepless nights and unvoiced fears. She was a fixture at Serenity, always arriving first thing in the morning, carrying the same worn leather bag and a quiet intensity that seemed to pulse beneath her calm demeanor. 

This afternoon was different. The usual calmness had evaporated, leaving Eleanor with an unsettling premonition, like a forgotten dream suddenly coming into focus.
