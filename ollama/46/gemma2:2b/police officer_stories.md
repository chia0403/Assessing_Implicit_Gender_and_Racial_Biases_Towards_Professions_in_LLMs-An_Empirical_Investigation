Rain hammered against the cracked asphalt of 12th Street like tiny hammers in an old man's hands. The neon sign outside "Chuckles Diner" flickered with an unsteady rhythm, barely fighting off the encroaching gloom. It was the kind of night where shadows crawled out and whispered secrets, the kind that made Detective Michael O'Malley feel like he had been staring into a bottomless abyss for years. 

He pulled his trench coat tighter around himself as he scanned the street corner, his eyes glued to the boarded-up storefront across from him. It was always quiet here, almost eerily so, especially after hours. The only sound was the steady drumming of rain and the occasional distant siren that seemed to pierce through the night like a screaming banshee. 

He wasn't just assigned to this case - it was his gut telling him something was wrong, something sinister lurking beneath the layer of grime on the window. A single red rose lay half-buried in the mud at its base, an impossible beauty amidst the decay. It felt personal. The only one who knew about this little spot and who had dared to leave such a thing would be someone close to him... if he were that unlucky. 


Michael tightened his grip on his badge, the metal cold against his skin. He didn't have time for speculation. He just needed answers.
