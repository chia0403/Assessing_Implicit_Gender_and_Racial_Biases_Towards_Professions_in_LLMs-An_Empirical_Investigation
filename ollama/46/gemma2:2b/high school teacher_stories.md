## Setting: 

The hum of fluorescent lights buzzed like trapped bees in Ms. Eleanor Hayes's classroom.  It echoed off the beige walls lined with posters depicting inspirational quotes she found utterly ridiculous after her fifth year teaching at Northwood High School. The smell of stale coffee mingled with that peculiar aroma only adolescence could conjure, a mix of sweat and teenage rebellion. It was 8:00 pm on Thursday, and Ms. Hayes was struggling to ignore the rhythmic thumping of her heart – it sounded more like thunder than the usual metronome tick-tock. 

## Character: 

Ms. Eleanor Hayes wasn't one for dramatic displays of affection or spontaneous outbursts.  Instead, she kept her emotions tightly controlled beneath her neatly ironed collar and a perpetually bored expression etched onto her face. Her students, however, would call it "The Look" - a chillingly neutral stare that could send shivers down their spines or inspire grudging respect at the same time.

## Opening: 

"Alright everyone," she began in her usual monotone voice, the only sound other than the click of her pen against paper.  Eleanor's gaze swept over the faces before her, each one a tableau of teenage angst – acne-ridden faces contorted with frustration as they struggled with Algebra equations; teenagers glued to their phones; the usual suspects - the jocks looking bored and the drama queens whispering about the latest school gossip. "Let's talk about...well, let's just say things are *interesting* this week." She paused for a beat, then added with the kind of deadpan expression that could make a hardened criminal blush: "And yes, I know it's Friday night, but remember: homework is due tomorrow morning.  Don't expect me to be swayed by your pleas if you haven't done the work."
