The scent of lavender essential oil and pine needles hung thick in the air, mingling with the earthy aroma of cedarwood and sandalwood that permeated every corner of Willow Creek Massage Therapy.  Inside, nestled amongst vintage bookshelves stacked high with titles from authors ranging from Steinbeck to Murakami, sat Amelia "Amy" Thorne, her fingers kneading a tense knot in a young man's shoulder. He was barely 20, his face buried in the fabric of his oversized hoodie as he shifted restlessly, eyes shut against the soothing pressure. His name was David, and Amy had been working on him for nearly an hour now. 

The gentle hum of the massage table’s motor and the soft crackle of a nearby crackling fireplace were Amelia's only companions in this quiet haven. Outside, the winter storm howled its fury against the old brick facade of her business.  Amy didn't mind, not really. The storm was just another layer to the cozy atmosphere she'd cultivated over years of tending to her clients’ aches and pains with an empathetic touch. For Amy, there was a kind of magic in turning the tension of the world into something as tangible as the kneading of fingers against aching muscles. And right now, with David's breathing steady and his brow unfurling under the soothing pressure of her hands, she felt a silent hope bloom within her. 

Maybe it wouldn't be so bad after all - maybe this storm would wash over them both eventually, leaving behind only peace and calm.
