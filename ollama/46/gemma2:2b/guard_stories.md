The air hung thick and hot over Aethelburg like a damp wool blanket draped over a dying ember.  Aelric "Sturdy" Thorne was used to the city's oppressive heat; it had been his companion since he first walked these cobbled streets, ever since his childhood days spent chasing stray pigeons in the shadow of the castle walls. Aelric stood sentinel at the gates, his heavy armor humming against the stone. He glanced down at the worn leather belt around his waist, where a worn brass whistle hung like a tiny metal sun.  The city’s heartbeat was slow and heavy tonight, its rhythm dictated by a palpable unease that seeped into every corner of Aethelburg's walls. The only hint of life came from the occasional flicker of a torchlight or the distant murmur of a drunken reveler in the shadows.

Aelric had seen plenty of nights like this before, countless shadows dancing to their own silent song as he patrolled his post.  His duty was simple: ensure no unwanted guests crossed the city gates. Aethelburg’s history was one of peace and prosperity, but that peace was always held at a knife's edge. The whispers about the neighboring kingdom – the one known only as "The Shadowlands" - kept Aelric on high alert. Even in this suffocating heat, his mind churned with worry, an echo of restless anxieties he could not quite shake off.
