## Setting:

The whirring of machinery was the symphony to Elias Thorne's ears. Dust motes danced in the dim light filtering through the stained-glass windows of the old factory, illuminated by the harsh glow of his drafting table lamp.  He sat hunched over a stack of blueprints, each one as worn and creased as the fabric of his own aging jeans.  The air was thick with the metallic scent of welding fumes, a potent reminder of the constant struggle between creation and destruction that marked his life at the Zenith Manufacturing plant - he was, after all, a draftsman for a company specializing in building, then dismantling, metal reactors for energy generation.

## Character:

**Elias Thorne**, 52 years old, stood as tall as his imposing build allowed, yet there was an almost fragile quality about him beneath the gruff exterior.  Years of working within the industrial steel-and-shadow landscape had etched lines into his face – a map of sweat, smoke, and late nights spent hunched over blueprints.  His hands were calloused, rough with years of holding pencils and tracing complex curves onto paper - but his eyes still held a youthful spark of curiosity and a quiet determination that he only saw reflected in the depths of the blueprints themselves.


**Opening:**

A low groan echoed through the factory as Elias adjusted the clamps on a particularly stubborn reactor section, its weight a familiar burden in his hands.  His fingers brushed against the worn metal, remembering countless hours spent studying and replicating these complex devices, hoping to one day understand them fully – but always knowing they would remain just another cog in the relentless cycle of energy production. 

He slammed down the clamp, a satisfying clink that momentarily drowned out the factory's usual cacophony, before the sound of his supervisor’s voice cut through the stillness. "Elias? We need to talk."
