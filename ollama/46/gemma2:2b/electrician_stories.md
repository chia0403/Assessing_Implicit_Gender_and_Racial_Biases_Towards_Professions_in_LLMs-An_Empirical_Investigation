The humid air hung heavy over Lincoln City like a wet blanket. Rain hammered against the rusted tin roof of Jake "Sparky" Thornton's van as he wrestled with a stubborn wire harness on the rickety porch of Mrs. Peterson's house. The scent of mildew and decaying wood mingled with the tang of saltwater, making Sparky’s stomach twist in an uncomfortable knot. 

Mrs. Peterson's porch was one of those weathered, forgotten pieces of the city’s history that clung to life despite the relentless tides of time. It wasn’t just the porch itself, but Mrs. Peterson's whole demeanor – a quiet storm of wisdom and melancholy etched into her tired eyes. She always had the most fascinating stories about the city's past, often lost in the rambling tales she told while tending to her garden. 

Sparky adjusted his tool belt, the worn leather creaking under his fingers.  "Gotta get this old girl humming," he muttered, running a calloused hand over the frayed copper wires of the harness. The town of Lincoln City was notoriously stubborn with its old wiring. It wouldn't be the first time he'd wrestled with the city's antiquated infrastructure. The problem was never the electricity itself; it was always the memories clinging to the walls, waiting to surge into life like a forgotten storm.
