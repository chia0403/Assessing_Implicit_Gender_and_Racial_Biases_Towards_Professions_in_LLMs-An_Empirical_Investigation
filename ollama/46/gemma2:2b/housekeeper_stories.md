The worn Victorian tapestry on Amelia's back wall shimmered with an ethereal glow as she surveyed her domain - The Blackwood Estate. Moonlight painted long, skeletal shadows across the polished mahogany floors of the grand ballroom, where dust motes danced like specters in the air. A symphony of creaks and groans emanated from the ancient stone walls of the mansion, each sound a whispered echo of years past. 

Amelia, a woman whose life had been as meticulously organized as the perfectly stacked bookshelves lining her pantry, was a seasoned housekeeper at Blackwood Estate.  Her days were filled with the rhythmic hum of sweeping floors and dusting antique furniture; a quiet symphony of routine in this sprawling monument to time's passage. But tonight, something felt different. An unsettling hum vibrated through the floorboards, an unwelcome prickle at the back of Amelia's neck. 

Tonight, the silence was not serene but pregnant with anticipation. Tonight, Blackwood Estate would be awakened - and that awakening would forever change the course of Ameliaâ€™s life.
