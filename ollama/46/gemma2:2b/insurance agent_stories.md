Rain hammered against the windows of Amelia "Amy" Beaumont's office, each drop a tiny percussionist on the steel-framed facade. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of vanilla from her old, beloved diffuser and the stale aroma of coffee that never quite seemed to go cold. Amy sat at her desk, phone propped against a faded floral lamp, scrolling through a list she'd painstakingly compiled: "Potential Clients Who Don't Quite Feel Like Clients." 

The storm raged on outside, mimicking the turmoil brewing in Amy's own chest.  It was like someone had poured acid onto her normally calm demeanor. A week ago, she'd gotten another rejection from an insurance firm for a coveted position as regional manager. This new company, "Apex Insurance", was everything to her: ambitious, cutting-edge, and offering a chance at the kind of career trajectory that seemed destined for Amy. 

The problem? She was stuck in her little corner office, peddling policies like they were magic spells – trying to convince people of the importance of risk mitigation when she herself felt on the precipice of falling down. The irony wasn't lost on her. After all, she was a woman who built her life around helping others navigate the unpredictable terrain of life – and yet she couldn't seem to find stability in her own world. 

The phone rang.  Amy sighed as she looked at the caller ID - Mrs. Henderson. Amy had been trying to convince the stubborn widow for months that it was time to upgrade her life insurance policy, but Mrs. Henderson seemed set in her ways. Now, there was a storm brewing outside and an unyielding quiet inside.
