## The Whispering Caves

The air hung thick with anticipation, heavy like the humidity pressing against Agnes' skin as she stood at the entrance to the Whispering Caves.  Her worn leather jacket felt tight over her slim frame, mirroring the tension coiled in her chest.  Even after years of leading tourists through these ancient caverns, a shiver still ran down her spine each time they entered the labyrinth. 

Agnes, officially known as Agnes Blackwood - though most called her "Angie" - had inherited the guiding mantle from her grandmother. It was a lineage burdened with stories whispered through generations: tales of hidden passages, forgotten spirits, and echoes that seemed to carry secrets of a bygone era.  Today's tour was different. A group of scientists, armed with modern technology and eager faces, stood behind her, their backpacks brimming with gadgets and curious expressions. 

Angie adjusted the worn satchel slung across her shoulder, its leather creaking in protest.  The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky a fiery orange, while a thin layer of mist rose from the ground, weaving an eerie veil over the entrance to the caves. It was going to be a night unlike any other.
