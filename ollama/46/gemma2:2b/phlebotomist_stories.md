The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Blackwood's head, casting a sickly yellow pallor across the cluttered waiting room. It was 8:05 AM, the first hour of her shift at the Northridge Medical Center, and the silence was unsettlingly thick. Amy shifted uncomfortably in her scrubs, the soft cotton rubbing against her knees as she watched the clock tick by. She took a deep breath, trying to quell the rising anxiety that always clawed its way up her throat when she started work, before a chorus of coughs broke the stillness. 

Amy was used to it.  Every day brought its own unique tapestry of patient anxieties and medical dramas. She'd worked as a phlebotomist for five years at the Northridge clinic, each draw becoming an intricate dance between needle and vein, her deft touch a calming influence in the whirlwind of chaos that surrounded her. Today was no different. The waiting room's silence had a strange, anticipatory hum; a quiet tension that hung heavy in the air.  It wasnâ€™t just nerves. Amy could sense something else - a deeper unease, perhaps even fear - radiating from the woman sitting on the edge of the sofa. She wore a long shawl over her worn coat and clutched a small, leather-bound book like a talisman against an unseen evil. 


**Setting:**  A bustling neighborhood clinic in the outskirts of Los Angeles, California. The medical center is old and quaint, with peeling paint on the walls and faded floral upholstery on the waiting room chairs. The air feels thick with anxiety and unspoken secrets.
