The midday sun beat down on the asphalt, turning it into a shimmering mirage.  Every surface in the tiny town of Willow Creek seemed to hum with the oppressive heat, making even the usually jovial atmosphere feel thick and heavy.   Miles away from the bustling city lights and sounds, it was just dirt roads and creaking wooden buildings, all connected by an unforgiving wind that carried not only dust but also whispered secrets of lives lived and lost.  

This was home for Ezra "EZ" Thompson, a roofer whose life had become as worn down as the shingles he expertly handled each day. He'd been climbing roofs since he could walk, his father teaching him the tricks of trade while whispering tales of weathered men and soaring gusts.  He’d built his own reputation on a foundation of honest work and an unwavering determination to see every job through. 

His current project was nothing short of monumental: The old Miller homestead, notorious for its creaky floors and whispers of long-lost family secrets. The house had been neglected for decades, its once vibrant paint peeled away like sunburnt skin, revealing the rough wood beneath.  As EZ started his work at dawn, he felt a familiar pang in his chest—a longing for something beyond the dust and sweat that marked his days.
