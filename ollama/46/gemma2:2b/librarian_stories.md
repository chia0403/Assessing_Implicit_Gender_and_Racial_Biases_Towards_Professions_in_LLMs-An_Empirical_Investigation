The hushed symphony of turning pages was Amelia’s morning ritual.  She ran her fingers along the spines of the worn volumes lining the shelves in the dimly lit stacks of Old Blackwood Library, a place where centuries-old whispers seemed to linger on the wind and secrets clung to dusty tomes like moth wings. As Head Librarian of this peculiar haven for forgotten lore, Amelia knew that the magic of stories was woven into the very fabric of the building.  

Today’s calm wasn't broken by the usual morning rush; even the city outside lay dormant in the pre-dawn hush. The rain fell softly against the windows, a melancholic counterpoint to the quiet hum of her thoughts. She adjusted the worn leather spectacles perched on her nose and focused on a particularly fascinating tome – an ancient grimoire rumored to contain lost spells for weaving reality itself.  

Amelia’s world had always been one of silent whispers and forgotten tales. The library was more than just a repository; it was a sanctuary, a gateway to the hidden recesses of human imagination. But today, something felt different. A prickle on her skin, like an unseen hand brushing against her arm, sent goosebumps erupting across her arms.
