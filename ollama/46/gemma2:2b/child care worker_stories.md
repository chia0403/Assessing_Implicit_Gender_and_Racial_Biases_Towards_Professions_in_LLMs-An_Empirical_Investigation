The air hung thick with the scent of applesauce and freshly washed laundry – a peculiar combination that Amelia found comforting, even if a little sickly sweet in its own right.  She was perched on a wobbly stool at the corner of Mrs. Peabody's living room, surrounded by her charges - three giggling preschoolers who were currently engaged in a battle of spoons with Mrs. Peabody’s homemade jam. 

Amelia's name was Amelia Thornton – "Mimi" to her little friends, and to those few adults who still dared call out her full name after years of practice.  She had been their nanny for the past five years, ever since Mrs. Peabody moved into a slightly more spacious retirement home with the help of some lovely state-funded modifications. The house was small – even with all its quirks and charm – but Mimi loved it. She lived in the space between childhood dreams and the slow, steady hum of life's quiet moments. 


She watched as Leo, her most enthusiastic student (and the one who had accidentally launched a miniature jam volcano) was attempting to use his spoon as a catapult against the other two, who were engaged in an elaborate game of pretend tea party with their handmade crowns.  Outside, the summer breeze whispered secrets through the old oak tree that dominated Mrs. Peabody's yard – secrets about forgotten adventures and lost dreams. 


It was here, in this quiet corner of Mrs. Peabody’s house, that Amelia found her own little spark of magic. She had a secret: she couldn't quite put it into words but it felt like a melody waiting to be written on the page.
