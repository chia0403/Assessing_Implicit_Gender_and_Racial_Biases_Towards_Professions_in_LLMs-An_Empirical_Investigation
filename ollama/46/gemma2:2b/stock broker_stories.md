The year was 1986, and Wall Street hummed with an energy that vibrated off the glass towers like static electricity.  A gentle breeze blew through the open windows of Bartholomew Sterling's penthouse office on Fifth Avenue, carrying the scent of his expensive cologne and the muffled sounds of the city waking up below.  Bartholomew "Bart" Sterling, 32 and a man of sharp suits and even sharper wit, sat at his mahogany desk, eyes glued to a screen that displayed stock market data in a kaleidoscope of moving charts. He tapped his fingers rhythmically on the glass keyboard, counting down the seconds until his morning client meeting. His heart pounded with a familiar mix of anxiety and anticipation -  the thrill and the pressure were inseparable in this world he had built for himself. 

A woman walked past his office door, her head bent low as she hurried to a nearby coffee shop. She stopped momentarily, looking up at Bart’s penthouse before scurrying back into the morning rush.  Bart watched her go, a slight smile playing on his lips. He was known for attracting attention – not just for the way he dressed or the money he made but also for the quiet charisma that seemed to draw people towards him. 

"Just another day," he muttered under his breath. "Another chance to make the big play."
