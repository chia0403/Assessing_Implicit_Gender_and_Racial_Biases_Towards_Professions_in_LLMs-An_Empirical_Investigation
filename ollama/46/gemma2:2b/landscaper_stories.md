The afternoon sun beat down on Felix Thorne's back as he worked. The air hung heavy with the scent of freshly cut grass and blooming jasmine, a stark contrast to the acrid tang of burning ozone that always seemed to hang around him after an electrical storm.  His canvas was his usual patch of green: a small suburban cul-de-sac filled with meticulously manicured lawns and pristine flower beds. Felix wasn't one for fancy gardens or extravagant design – he found peace in the simple act of shaping nature's raw beauty into something tangible, a form of creation that felt as much like art as it did work. 

He knelt to trim the last unruly blade of grass in Mrs. Henderson's rose garden, his calloused fingers deftly wielding his shears. He paused, a sense of unease settling upon him.  An unsettling silence had settled over the neighborhood unlike any he’d known before. Even the chirp of crickets seemed to have been muted. A single, crimson-tinged feather dropped onto the meticulously kept rose bushes, an unwelcome splash of red against the pristine white petals.
