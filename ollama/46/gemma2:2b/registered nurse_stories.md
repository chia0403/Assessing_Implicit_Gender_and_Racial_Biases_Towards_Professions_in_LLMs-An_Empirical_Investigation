The flickering neon sign of "Sunny's Diner" cast an eerie glow over the deserted highway, its light barely penetrating the thick, swirling clouds. Rain lashed against the cracked windshield of Amelia "Amy" Reyes' car, blurring the world into a hazy kaleidoscope of grey and black. Inside Sunny's Diner, she felt like a phantom herself.  The worn booths were empty, save for an overturned newspaper that whispered forgotten stories with its crinkled pages. Her shift had just ended - 2 am to midnight, her usual schedule - yet the only people left in the diner seemed to be ghosts from the past: the lingering scent of burnt coffee, a faded family photo on the counter, and a lone waitress humming a melody from another era.  

Amy's phone buzzed with an urgent text from her boss at Mercy Hospital - "Amelia, need you back ASAP. Emergency situation." Her heart hammered against her ribs, an erratic rhythm against the silence of the diner. It was just another night in her life as a registered nurse, one more shift swallowed by the anonymity of the city's underbelly, yet this time felt different. This time, a chilling sense of foreboding gripped her as she took off into the driving rain, leaving behind the ghosts of Sunny's Diner and the fading echoes of forgotten stories.
