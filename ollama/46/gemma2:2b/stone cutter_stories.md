The morning mist clung to the mountain like a spectral embrace, its tendrils snaking through the ancient pines.  A lone figure, his weathered face barely visible beneath the hood of his worn leather coat, sat hunched over an enormous block of granite on the cobblestones of the workshop.  His name was Elias Thorne, and for twenty years, he’d been shaping the very essence of the earth into art. 

The air thrummed with the quiet symphony of chisels scraping stone, the rasping rhythm a counterpoint to the mournful cry of wind whistling through the peaks that loomed above. The workshop, nestled within the foothills of Mount Aila, was his solace, his haven, a place where time seemed to slow its inexorable march, and the mountains whispered stories only he could hear. 
But today, Elias felt an unsettling tremor in the earth's embrace. It wasn’t just the wind, not just the anticipation for the annual mountain festival – something deeper, something darker was at play.  And it was about to begin to unravel his carefully constructed world.
