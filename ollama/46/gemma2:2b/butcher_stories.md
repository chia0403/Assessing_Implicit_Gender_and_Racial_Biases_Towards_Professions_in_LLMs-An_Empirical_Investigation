## The Smell of Blood and Secrets

**Setting:**  Old North Market, a bustling city square in Chicago where vendors hawk everything from artisanal cheese to hand-stitched purses, but also hides a hidden labyrinth of alleyways steeped in history and whispers. The air hangs heavy with the scent of freshly ground coffee, sizzling meat, and something deeper, more pungent – the aroma of old secrets clinging to the cobblestones and shadowed corners. 

**Character:** Elias Thorne, known by everyone as "Eli" for his gruff exterior and even gruffer laughter. A third-generation butcher at "Thorne & Sons," Eli's family legacy was built on tradition and respect – but also fueled by an almost unsettling calm in the face of death, a silence that only hardened the lines on his weathered features. 

**Story Opening:**

The midday sun cast long, lazy shadows across the meat market as Eli surveyed his domain – rows upon rows of gleaming silver knives and steel-boned hams. The air hummed with the rhythmic clang of metal against metal, punctuated by the sharp crackle of sausages being grilled over an open fire.  Eli’s gaze lingered on a particularly large, aged boar, its head missing and only leaving behind a gaping maw carved into the flesh. He'd inherited his father's uncanny ability to read a carcass - even before it was butchered. This boar, however, felt different. It had an edge to it, a subtle pulse that whispered of unseen secrets beneath the surface of meat.

His assistant, young Tommy, walked in with a fresh delivery of lamb legs. He looked hesitant, his eyes darting between Eli's stoic face and the silent boar. "Everything alright, boss?" 

Eli just grunted, his thick brow creased as he studied the boar. He knew what was coming next - the whispered stories from the alleyways about a curse hidden in this very beast’s bloodline. “Tommy,” he said, his voice like gravel grinding against stone.  "Time to learn if these rumors are true.”
