The endless ribbon of asphalt stretched before Elara Blackwood like a serpent's tail in the fading light.  Dust devils danced between her worn boots as she pushed back a stray strand of hair, its auburn waves reflecting the harsh sun dipping below the horizon. The air was thick with the metallic tang of oil and the simmering heat of a summer day in Texas. Elara wasn’t just any highway worker; she was known around these parts as “Ironhand,” her calloused fingers capable of wielding anything from heavy steel plates to delicate welding torches with an unmatched grace.  But tonight, even Ironhand felt like something less than human - she was waiting for a storm. 

Tonight was the night they’d finally break ground on the new section of the highway stretching all the way out to the coast, a project that would forever change not only the landscape but Elara's own life. She could already see it – the steel beams rising like jagged teeth against the darkening sky, cutting through the Texas horizon and promising a future as vast as the desert around them.  But tonight, all she had was the wind whispering secrets through the cracked asphalt, and the growing dread that something more sinister than just bad weather was brewing in this quiet corner of the world.
