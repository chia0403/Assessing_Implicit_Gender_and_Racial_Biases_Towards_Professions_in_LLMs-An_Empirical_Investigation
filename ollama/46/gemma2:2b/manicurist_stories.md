## Setting:

The air in Bella's little shop on Elm Street hung thick with the scent of lemon-infused hand lotion, nail polish remover, and unspoken tension. It was one of those humid August days that seemed to press down on you like an unseen weight, making even a simple "Good morning" sound strained.  The only source of welcome air was the open window that overlooked the bustling street scene:  cars honking, children chasing after ice cream trucks, and the ever-present murmur of city life. 

## Character:

Bella was young, maybe 25 at most, with a face still full of promise and a mop of curly hair the color of burnt cinnamon. The years she spent working in her late grandmother's quaint nail salon had etched an artistry onto her hands.  Her fingers, nimble and precise, could coax even the most stubborn cuticles into submission.  But Bella’s smile never quite reached her eyes, always shadowed by a quiet unease that seemed to pulse beneath her fingertips.


## Story Opening:

The door chime echoed through the shop with a jarring clink. A woman stepped in, carrying herself like a storm cloud draped in silk and fury. Her name was Amelia, Bella knew.  But for some reason, the woman's presence was like walking into an old record player; it was playing a song that felt far too familiar, one she'd heard echoing through her subconscious for years. 


“Bella,” Amelia rasped, her voice barely above a whisper, “Is there… something you can do?”
  
Bella stared at the woman’s bruised knuckles and saw not just a sign of past pain but a ripple effect of fear.  A familiar knot tightened in her stomach as she took out two empty jars of nail polish - red, for Amelia's anger, and blue, for the sorrow that lingered in her eyes. “I think,” Bella said slowly, tilting her chin, “that we might need more than just color.”
