The rusty wrench felt familiar in Elias Thorne's hands. He was used to its comforting heft, used to the way it sang against porcelain fixtures and groaned as he tightened bolts on pipes that ran deeper into the building than his own memories. This old wrench had been passed down from his grandfather, a man who'd built his plumbing empire with sweat and grit, his only tool being the promise of a good pipe joint and a hearty laugh. The old man had said, "A plumber is more than just someone who fixes leaks; they're part architect, part detective, part magician." Elias was starting to believe it. 

He stood in the cramped attic of a Victorian mansion on Elm Street, its bones creaking under his weight. Sunlight struggled to pierce the grime-coated windows, painting the dust motes dancing in the air with an ephemeral glow. Outside, the world bustled with life: children chasing pigeons in the park, cars roaring down the main street, but here, within this forgotten haven of stone and timber, the only movement was Elias's own steady rhythm as he surveyed the mess before him â€“ a cascade of leaks that threatened to swallow the whole structure.
