The chill wind whipped through the crumbling stone archway, carrying with it the scent of salt and decay. Reginald "Reggie" Thorne, his threadbare cloak pulled tight against the biting air, adjusted his grip on the rusty halberd. The moon, a pale sliver in the inky sky, cast long, skeletal shadows across the overgrown courtyard.

Reggie was the sole guardian of Blackhaven Keep, a once-imposing fortress now reduced to crumbling walls and whispering legends. Generations ago, it had housed a powerful sorcerer king, but centuries of neglect had left it vulnerable to the elements and whispers of forgotten magic that clung to its stones like cobwebs.  Tonight, the silence was unnerving. Usually, Reggie could hear the scuttling of rats in the walls or the distant hoot of an owl, but even those familiar sounds were absent.
