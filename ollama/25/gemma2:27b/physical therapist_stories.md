The salty air whipped Eleanor "Ellie" Hayes's auburn braid against her cheek as she surveyed the ramshackle fishing village nestled between towering cliffs and the churning turquoise sea. Salt spray painted the weathered wooden houses in shades of grey, and the cries of gulls mingled with the rhythmic crash of waves against the shore. Ellie had traded the sterile, fluorescent-lit world of a city hospital for this rugged coastal haven, drawn by the promise of helping fishermen mend their battered bodies after years spent battling the unforgiving sea. 

Her new clinic, a converted boathouse perched precariously on the edge of the pier, smelled faintly of fish and seaweed. It wasn't much to look at – chipped paint peeled from the walls, and sunlight streamed through cracks in the weathered roof – but Ellie saw potential in its sturdy bones and breathtaking view. 

Today was her first official day. Nervous excitement churned in her stomach as she waited for her first patient, a seasoned fisherman named Finnigan O'Malley, known for his gruff demeanor and legendary catches. The weathered door creaked open, revealing Finnigan’s hulking frame silhouetted against the blinding midday sun. He limped inside, his face etched with pain and suspicion. 

Ellie stood up, her hand outstretched in a gesture of welcome. "Mr. O'Malley? Welcome to the clinic. I'm Ellie."
