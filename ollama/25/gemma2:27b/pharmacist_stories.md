Rain hammered against the dusty windowpanes of "Apothecary Lane," blurring the neon sign that buzzed erratically above the door. Inside, Elara Blackwood meticulously counted out lavender capsules, her brow furrowed in concentration. The scent of chamomile and rosemary hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the dreary November evening. A lone bell tinkled as Mrs. Henderson shuffled in, her face pinched with worry. Elara looked up, offering her warmest smile â€“ one she'd perfected over years of dealing with anxious customers seeking solace in bottled remedies.

"Evening, Mrs. Henderson," Elara greeted, setting down the lavender jar. "What can I do for you?"


The bell chimed again, this time louder, followed by a gust of wind that whipped through the shop as a tall figure stepped inside, momentarily blocking out the dim streetlight filtering in from the rain-soaked window.  Elara's smile faltered, replaced by a prickle of unease. She couldn't quite place him, but something about his shadowed face and piercing blue eyes sent a shiver down her spine.
