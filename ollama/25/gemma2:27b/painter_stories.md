Rain lashed against the attic windowpane, each drop a miniature hammer blow against the dusty glass. The air hung thick with the scent of linseed oil and turpentine, a familiar comfort to Eloise Beaumont, her easel positioned beneath the single bare bulb that illuminated the cramped space. Her canvas, still wet, depicted a storm-tossed sea, waves crashing against jagged cliffs in a symphony of grey and white.

Eloise, her fiery red hair escaping its braid and framing freckled cheeks, squinted at the canvas, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The storm outside mirrored the one brewing within her. Her latest commission – a portrait for the wealthy Lord Ashworth – was due in two weeks, yet she felt hopelessly stuck. The blankness on the second canvas mocked her, refusing to be filled with the likeness of the stern-faced man whose image haunted her dreams.  

The rhythmic patter of rain seemed to echo the beat of her own restless heart. Eloise longed for inspiration, for a spark to ignite the creative fire within her. But all she found was frustration, and a growing sense that perhaps she wasn't meant for this world of commissions and expectations.  Maybe it was time to abandon the portrait altogether and chase a different muse, one that sang to her soul instead of demanding payment.
