The cicadas throbbed like a bass drum solo in the humid Alabama air. Sweat stung Elias Bartholomew's eyes as he wrestled with a stubborn tangle of wisteria vines choking the life out of a magnificent magnolia tree. The homeowner, Mrs. Clementine Peabody, a woman who believed her hydrangeas were direct descendants of Cleopatra’s gardens, watched with hawk-like intensity from her sunroom window. 

Elias knew she'd find fault with something, even if he'd managed to coax blooms the size of dinner plates from her roses. He sighed and tugged harder on the vine, its tendrils snagging on a gnarled branch like a child clinging desperately to their mother’s leg.


The setting is a lush, overgrown garden in rural Alabama. It's summertime, hot and humid. The homeowner, Mrs. Peabody, is a demanding woman who takes her garden very seriously. Elias Bartholomew, the landscaper, is trying his best to please her but knows it will be an uphill battle.
