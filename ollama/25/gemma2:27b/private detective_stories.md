Rain hammered against the grimy windowpane of Theodore "Teddy" Blackwood's office, each drop a tiny fist pounding on the already cracked glass. The air hung heavy with the scent of stale cigarettes and desperation, a fitting aroma for the clientele Teddy usually attracted. He swiveled in his creaky leather chair, the springs groaning in protest as he faced the door. 

His office was tucked away in a forgotten corner of downtown Chicago, above a dingy Chinese takeout joint that perpetually smelled of sesame oil and regret.  The flickering neon sign outside barely illuminated the faded lettering on his door: "Blackwood Investigations - Discretion Guaranteed". 


Teddy's eyes, the color of stormy skies, scanned the darkened street below. He was expecting someone, a dame with legs like spun silk and trouble clinging to her like cheap perfume. The knock came just as the clock on his wall chimed seven, sharp and insistent.

"About time," Teddy muttered, pushing himself up from the chair. His joints protested with pops and clicks, a symphony of age and bad habits. He straightened his rumpled trench coat and headed towards the door, bracing himself for whatever tangled mess awaited him.
