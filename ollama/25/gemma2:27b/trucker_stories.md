The diesel engine grumbled like an irritable bear, vibrating through Bartholomew "Bart" Blackwood's calloused hands as he gripped the steering wheel. Outside his window, the Nevada desert stretched out under the relentless glare of the midday sun, shimmering waves of heat rising from the cracked asphalt. Bart squinted at the road ahead, a ribbon of grey winding through the endless ochre expanse. He'd been hauling this load of lumber for three days straight, battling fatigue and the ever-present loneliness that came with life on the open road. 

Bart's rig, a rusty but reliable Peterbilt named "Betsy" after his late mother, groaned under its burden.  He checked his mirrors, noting the dust devils swirling in Betsy's wake. This stretch of I-15 was notoriously desolate, offering little respite for weary travelers. He needed to find a rest stop soon, before the desert heat and fatigue claimed him entirely. 

Suddenly, a glint in the distance caught Bart's eye. It was a speck on the horizon, reflecting the sunlight with an unnatural brilliance. Curiosity piqued, he adjusted his course slightly, wondering what strange phenomenon lay ahead. Little did Bart know, that glimmering anomaly would change his life forever.
