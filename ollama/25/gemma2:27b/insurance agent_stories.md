Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Quill's office, blurring the neon glow of the liquor store across the street into an indistinct smear of color. The air hung thick with the scent of damp wool and stale coffee, a familiar aroma Bart associated with countless dreary Tuesdays spent poring over policy documents. 

He stared at the faded floral wallpaper peeling from the wall, wishing he was anywhere but here â€“ perhaps somewhere sunny, sipping something cold on a beach instead of drowning in paperwork. But alas, reality bit hard. He was Bartholomew Quill, insurance agent extraordinaire (or so his business cards proclaimed), and Tuesdays were for dealing with disgruntled clients who'd forgotten to pay their premiums.


Today promised to be no different.  Bart sighed, already dreading the inevitable phone call from Mrs. Henderson complaining about her missing cat again.
