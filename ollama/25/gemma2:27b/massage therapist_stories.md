Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Tranquil Touch", the rhythmic drumming echoing Elara Solstice's own anxious heartbeat.  She stared out at the storm-tossed city through the blurred glass, the neon signs of downtown reflected like fractured rainbows in the slick asphalt. The phone sat silent, its cheery chime replaced by a disconcerting quiet.

But tonight, it seemed the storm had kept everyone indoors, leaving Elara alone with the scent of lavender oil and the unsettling feeling that she'd made a terrible mistake.
