The Arizona sun beat down on Silas Blackwood's shoulders, turning his neon orange vest into a second skin. Sweat prickled under his hard hat, stinging his eyes. The endless ribbon of asphalt stretched before him, shimmering in the heat haze like a mirage. 

Silas squinted at the horizon, where the jagged peaks of the Superstition Mountains clawed at the cloudless sky. He'd spent years patching potholes and repaving stretches of this lonely highway, but the view never lost its power to awe. It was a harsh beauty, a landscape carved by wind and sun, echoing the solitude that clung to him like dust. Today, though, something felt different. A prickle of unease ran down his spine as he surveyed the deserted stretch ahead. Usually, even on these remote stretches, there'd be the occasional truck rumbling by or a lone car speeding through the heat. But today, silence reigned supreme, broken only by the chirping cicadas and the distant cry of a hawk.
