Rain lashed against the windows of Dr. Eleanor Vance's small clinic, blurring the lights of the fishing village into hazy orange orbs. The salty tang of the sea air mingled with the antiseptic scent of disinfectant, creating a unique aroma that Eleanor had come to associate with both comfort and unease.  

Tonight, the unease was winning. A low, mournful groan echoed from the back room where her latest patient lay - Old Man Finnigan, who'd taken a nasty tumble on the slippery docks earlier that evening. He clutched at his leg, face contorted in pain, his usually jovial eyes clouded with fear. Eleanor knew she had to work fast. The storm was worsening, and the ferry to the mainland hospital wouldn't be running tonight. She was all Finnigan had.

Taking a deep breath, Eleanor steeled herself. The weight of responsibility settled on her shoulders, familiar yet daunting in this isolated seaside community where she was the only doctor for miles.
