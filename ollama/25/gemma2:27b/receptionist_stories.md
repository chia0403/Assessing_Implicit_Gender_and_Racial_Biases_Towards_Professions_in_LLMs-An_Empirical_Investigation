The insistent buzzing of the intercom jolted Elara Blackwood back to reality. Her fingers, which had been absently tracing the intricate pattern etched into the antique mahogany desk, flew to the receiver.

"Good morning, Obsidian Industries," she chirped, her voice betraying none of the fatigue that gnawed at her after a restless night. Outside, the city was waking up, a cacophony of honking horns and rumbling buses vying for dominance against the backdrop of an ominous grey sky. The Obsidian Building, however, remained an island of polished granite and hushed whispers, its imposing facade reflecting the steel-grey clouds above. 

Elara glanced at the clock: 8:02 am sharp. Mr. Thorne, CEO and notorious stickler for punctuality, would be arriving any minute now. She straightened her crisp white blouse, smoothed down her pencil skirt, and steeled herself for another day navigating the labyrinthine world of corporate intrigue that was Obsidian Industries.
