Rain lashed against the attic window, a frantic drumming against the warped glass. Eleanor Ainsworth shivered, pulling her threadbare shawl tighter around her bony shoulders. Dust motes danced in the single beam of lamplight that pierced the gloom, illuminating stacks of ledgers and invoices piled precariously on every available surface. 

Eleanor's small attic room served as both her home and office. It wasn't much to look at - cracked plaster, a threadbare rug, and furniture scavenged from flea markets - but it was hers. And within its confines, Eleanor found solace amidst the comforting order of numbers.  She meticulously balanced accounts for local merchants, her sharp mind dissecting figures with the precision of a surgeon.

Tonight, however, the familiar rhythm of her work was disrupted. A shiver, unrelated to the cold, ran down her spine. The rhythmic tapping at the windowpane seemed insistent, almost desperate. Eleanor cautiously approached, peering through the grime-coated glass. In the swirling rain and flickering lamplight, she could just make out a shadowy figure huddled beneath the eaves.
