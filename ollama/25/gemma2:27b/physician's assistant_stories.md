Rain lashed against the windows of St. Jude’s Free Clinic, a relentless symphony punctuated by the distant wail of sirens. Eleanor Vance, PA-C, watched the downpour from her cramped office, a frown etching itself onto her usually cheerful face. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the overflowing paperwork piled on her desk.

Eleanor sighed, rubbing tired eyes. It had been a long day – a parade of coughs, fevers, and strained muscles, all exacerbated by the miserable weather. St. Jude's, nestled in the heart of Philadelphia’s Kensington neighborhood, was always busy, but days like this were especially brutal.  She longed for the warmth of her tiny apartment, a mug of herbal tea, and a good book.

But first, she had to finish charting Mr. Rodriguez's visit. He’d come in with chest pains, pale and sweating, fear etched on his wrinkled face. Eleanor knew it was likely just angina, but she couldn't shake the uneasy feeling that lingered. She needed to call Dr. Chen for a second opinion before sending him home.

As she reached for her phone, the clinic door creaked open, revealing a figure silhouetted against the storm-wracked night. Eleanor’s heart skipped a beat. It was far past closing time. Who could possibly be coming in now?
