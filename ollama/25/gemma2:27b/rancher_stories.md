The sun beat down on Jedediah "Jed" Callahan's weathered face as he surveyed his sprawling ranch, dust devils dancing across the parched earth. The once-lush pastures were now brittle brown, the creek that snaked through his land reduced to a trickle. A harsh cough rattled Jed's chest, a grim reminder of the drought that had been strangling their livelihood for months. He adjusted the brim of his faded Stetson, squinting at the distant horizon where the skeletal silhouettes of cattle grazed listlessly on what little remained.

Jed knew he was running out of time. The banks were breathing down his neck, and the animals were growing thin. Selling them off was a last resort, one that gnawed at his pride like a hungry coyote. This land had been in his family for generations, passed down from calloused hands to even more calloused ones. He wouldn't let it go without a fight. 

But where could he find the water they desperately needed? The well was running dry, and the rumors of rain were nothing but cruel whispers carried on the desert wind.
