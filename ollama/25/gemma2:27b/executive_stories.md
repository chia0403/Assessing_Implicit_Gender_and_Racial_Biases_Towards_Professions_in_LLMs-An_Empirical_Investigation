The air crackled with the low hum of the city, punctuated by the occasional insistent blare of a taxi horn.  Alistair, CEO of Cavendish Innovations, steepled his fingers and stared out at the storm, a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in his chest. His tailored suit, usually a symbol of power and control, felt constricting tonight.

But whispers of doubt had begun to circulate within the company, fueled by unforeseen technical glitches and a string of resignations from key personnel. Alistair, known for his unwavering confidence and iron will, couldn't shake the feeling that something was amiss.
