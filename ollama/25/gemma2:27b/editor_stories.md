Rain hammered against the grimy windowpanes of Eleanor Davenport's office, mimicking the insistent throb in her temple. The cramped space, tucked away on the fifth floor of a crumbling brownstone building, was illuminated only by the harsh glow of her desk lamp and the faint flicker of neon signs filtering in from the alley below. Stacks of manuscripts teetered precariously around her, each one a potential world waiting to be unlocked. Eleanor, with her perpetually ink-stained fingers and spectacles perched precariously on the bridge of her nose, was the gatekeeper of those worlds, a literary editor whose sharp eye could discern brilliance from banality.

Tonight, however, the manuscripts seemed to blur together in a jumble of words and half-formed ideas. The headache pounded louder, demanding attention. Eleanor sighed, pushing away the manuscript she'd been struggling with for hours â€“ a convoluted fantasy novel that felt more like a labyrinth than a story. She needed fresh air, a break from the suffocating weight of other people's dreams.

As she rose from her chair, a sudden clatter from the alley below caught her attention. Curiosity piqued, Eleanor cautiously approached the window and peered into the rain-soaked darkness. A figure huddled beneath a flickering streetlamp, their form obscured by the shadows. For a moment, Eleanor hesitated, torn between her desire for solitude and a growing sense of unease. The figure shifted, seemingly aware of her gaze. 

Eleanor's pulse quickened. This was no ordinary alley encounter. Something about the figure's hunched posture and the desperate glint of reflected light from its eyes sent a shiver down her spine.
