Rain lashed against the frosted windowpanes of Dr. Eleanor Cavendish's chiropractic clinic, blurring the neon glow of the "Open" sign hanging precariously above the door. Inside, Eleanor hummed along to an old blues track crackling on the radio, her fingers expertly working out a knot in a patient's shoulder. The scent of lavender essential oil hung heavy in the air, battling with the musty smell of aging hardwood floors and faded medical posters.

Eleanor glanced at the clock â€“ 5:57 pm. Closing time.  She sighed, anticipating the quiet solitude she craved after a long day of adjusting spines and soothing aches. Just then, a sharp knock on the door startled her. A gust of wind whipped open the door before Eleanor could reach it, revealing a drenched figure silhouetted against the stormy night.
