The midday sun beat down on Elias Blackwood’s shoulders as he chipped away at the rough granite block. Sweat stung his eyes, but he didn't dare stop. Each precise strike of his chisel brought him closer to revealing the angel hidden within the stone. His workshop, nestled in a quiet corner of the bustling city of Atheria, was filled with the rhythmic clang of hammer against chisel, the scent of dust and sweat hanging heavy in the air. 

Elias wasn't just any stone cutter; he possessed a rare gift. He could see the sculptures trapped within the raw rock, waiting to be freed. Today, his vision was clear: an angel, wings outstretched in flight, her face serene yet powerful. This commission, for the grand cathedral atop Atheria’s highest hill, was Elias's most ambitious yet. It was a chance to prove himself, to etch his name onto the heart of the city.
