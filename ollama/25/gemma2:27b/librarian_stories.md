The air hung heavy with the scent of aging paper and dust motes danced in the pale shafts of sunlight filtering through the arched windows. Eleanor Winthrop adjusted her spectacles, her gaze sweeping over the labyrinthine shelves of the Oakhaven Public Library. Built in 1898, the building was a Victorian masterpiece, its dark wood paneling and ornate carvings whispering tales of generations past. Eleanor, head librarian for the past fifteen years, felt a deep sense of peace amidst the hushed reverence of the space.

Today, however, something felt different. A peculiar energy hummed beneath the surface, a subtle shift in the usual stillness. It began with a tremor, barely perceptible, as if the ancient foundations themselves were stirring awake. Then, a faint scratching sound echoed from the depths of the library's restricted section, a place rarely visited and shrouded in mystery. Eleanor's heart quickened. This wasn't the work of curious mice; something else was at play.
