The scent of jasmine incense clung to the air in Esmeralda "Esme" Cortez's tiny office, barely masking the musty smell of old brochures and forgotten dreams. Outside, the Miami sun beat down relentlessly on Calle Ocho, turning the sidewalk into a sizzling skillet. Esme sighed, pushing away a stack of outdated pamphlets advertising luxury cruises to the Bahamas. Business had been slower than a sloth in molasses lately.

Her phone, usually buzzing with inquiries about exotic locales, lay silent. The only sound was the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers against the keyboard as she scrolled through online travel forums, searching for inspiration.  Esme longed for adventure, for the thrill of discovering hidden gems and sharing them with others. But lately, it felt like everyone wanted to stay home, glued to their screens, living vicariously through influencers' perfectly curated Instagram feeds.


Could Esme reignite the spark of wanderlust in her clients? Or would she be forever stuck in this purgatory of dusty brochures and unfulfilled dreams?
