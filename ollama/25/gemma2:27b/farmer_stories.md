The wind whipped across the endless expanse of wheat, its dry fingers tugging at Amelia Cartwright's worn shawl as she surveyed her land. Dawn was still an hour away, yet the sky was already bleeding hues of pink and orange, promising another scorcher. Dust devils danced in the distance, swirling reddish-brown against the backdrop of the rising sun. 

Amelia wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, the lines etched there deepening with each passing year. This farm, passed down through generations of Cartwrights, was more than just land; it was her blood and bones. She knew every furrow, every gnarled oak tree lining the perimeter, every whisper of the wind that carried tales of seasons past. But this year, the land felt different, strained under the relentless sun. The wheat stalks were thinner than usual, their golden heads drooping with exhaustion. A knot of worry tightened in Amelia's chest.
