Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the radio station, each drop drumming out a frantic rhythm that mirrored Amelia "Amy" Dubois's pounding heart. The air hung thick with static and ozone, the smell sharp in her nostrils as she hunched over the transmitter console. A tangled mess of wires spilled onto the floor around her feet, a testament to the hours she'd spent trying to coax the aging behemoth back to life.

The station, nestled precariously on a windswept cliff overlooking the stormy Atlantic, was Amelia's only lifeline. It was where she honed her technical skills inherited from her grandfather, a legendary radioman who had used the same weathered transmitter to broadcast hope and news during the darkest days of the war. Now, decades later, it was Amelia's turn to keep the signal alive.

Tonight, though, the old transmitter seemed determined to defeat her. Every adjustment she made resulted in a chorus of squeals and pops, a cacophony that threatened to shatter the fragile connection she maintained with the scattered community who relied on her broadcasts for news and company.
