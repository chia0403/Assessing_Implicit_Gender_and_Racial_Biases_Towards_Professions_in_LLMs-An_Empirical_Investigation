The air in Salon Serendipity hung heavy with the scent of lavender shampoo and burnt hairspray. It was Tuesday afternoon, the lull between the lunchtime rush and the after-work crowd, and Estelle Dubois, her fiery red curls piled high atop her head like a sculpted crown, was staring forlornly at the chipped polish on her own nails. "Another day, another chipped dream," she muttered to herself, picking absently at the faded scarlet. 

Estelle loved Salon Serendipity, its vintage floral wallpaper and mismatched furniture imbued with the stories of countless transformations it had witnessed. But lately, a weariness had settled over her like a second skin. The repetitive snips, the endless color consultations, the forced smiles â€“ it all felt increasingly monotonous. Today, she longed for something more, a spark to ignite the passion that once burned brightly within her. Little did Estelle know, that spark was about to arrive, delivered in the form of a nervous young woman with an unusual request and secrets swirling behind her hazel eyes.
