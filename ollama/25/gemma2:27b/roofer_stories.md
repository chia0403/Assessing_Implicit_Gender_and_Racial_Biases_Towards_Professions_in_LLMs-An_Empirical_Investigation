The midday sun beat down on Silas Jeremiah Blackwood's neck, turning the sweat pooling beneath his bandana into a scalding hot stream.  He squinted at the warped shingles before him, their edges curling like burnt parchment. The ancient Victorian house, perched precariously on a hill overlooking the shimmering expanse of Chesapeake Bay, groaned under the summer heat. Silas swore he could hear the timbers complaining about being subjected to another scorcher.

He'd been working roofs since he was old enough to hold a hammer, following in the footsteps of his grandfather and father before him.  Blackwood Roofing had been a fixture in Annapolis for generations, their name synonymous with honesty, hard work, and roofs that wouldn't leak even in the fiercest hurricane. Silas was proud to carry on the tradition, but today, the charm of his legacy was being overshadowed by the relentless sun and a nagging pain in his right knee.  

He shifted his weight, trying to find a comfortable position on the steeply slanted roof. This wasn't the kind of job you could just walk away from; lives depended on roofs staying intact.  Silas took a swig from his water bottle, grimacing at the lukewarm liquid. He needed a break, but the homeowner, a nervous, chatty woman named Mrs. Hawthorne, was due back any minute. 

Suddenly, a flash of movement caught Silas's eye. A glint of sunlight reflecting off something… metallic?  He turned his head slowly, heart thudding in his chest.  Nestled amongst the overgrown ivy on the neighboring rooftop, sat a gleaming object. It looked like… a telescope.  And pointed directly at him.
