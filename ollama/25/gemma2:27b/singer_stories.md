The air in the Blue Moon Saloon was thick with cigarette smoke and anticipation. A haze hung low above the worn wooden tables and mismatched chairs, illuminated by strings of dim fairy lights and the occasional flash of lightning through the grimy windowpanes. Rain hammered against the tin roof, creating a rhythm that underscored the nervous flutter in Elara Rose Blackwood's stomach.

Elara adjusted the strap of her battered acoustic guitar, its once-glossy finish now dulled with years of sweat and strumming. She took a deep breath, trying to quell the butterflies erupting within her chest. Tonight was her chance â€“ the night she'd been dreaming of for years: a spot on the Blue Moon stage, opening for the legendary bluesman, Blind Willie Johnson.
