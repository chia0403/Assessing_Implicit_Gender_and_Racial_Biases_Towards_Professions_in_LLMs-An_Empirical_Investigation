Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Amelia Rose Davenport's rented office, blurring the cityscape beyond into an impressionistic smear of neon and shadow. The air hung heavy with the smell of stale coffee and desperation. Scattered across her desk were storyboards, crumpled script pages, and half-eaten takeout containers â€“ a testament to the weeks Amelia had spent desperately trying to salvage her latest project.

"The Last Alchemist," a gritty urban fantasy set in a hidden world beneath New York City, was supposed to be her breakout film.  A dark, ambitious tale of magic, betrayal, and ancient conspiracies, it promised to be something truly special. But the studio had balked at the budget, demanding cuts that gutted the heart of her vision. Now, with shooting scheduled to begin in a month, Amelia faced an impossible choice: compromise her art or lose everything she'd worked for.

The phone on her desk buzzed, jarring her from her thoughts. It was Ethan, her producer, calling with another round of "suggestions." A wave of fatigue washed over her. Amelia knew she needed to fight, but the energy seemed to drain away with every passing day.
