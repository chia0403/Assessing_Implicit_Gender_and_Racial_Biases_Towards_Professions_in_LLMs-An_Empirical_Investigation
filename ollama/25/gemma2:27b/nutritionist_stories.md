The aroma of roasting garlic and caramelized onions wafted through Eloise Amelia Cartwright's tiny apartment kitchen, battling with the stale scent of instant coffee lingering from her rushed morning. Outside, the relentless drizzle of Seattle seemed to mirror Eloise's mood – a steady, melancholic gray.  

Eloise, a petite woman with fiery red curls perpetually escaping their bun, sighed as she stirred the bubbling vegetable stew on the stovetop. This wasn’t how she envisioned her life at thirty-two. After years of studying and pouring her heart into becoming a registered dietitian, she was stuck working for a faceless corporation, churning out generic meal plans for clients who never seemed to truly grasp the importance of nourishing their bodies.

Today, however, Eloise had a glimmer of hope. A new client, Ms. Eleanor Hawthorne, was scheduled for a consultation this afternoon. Eleanor, according to her file, was an accomplished artist battling chronic fatigue and struggling to find inspiration in her work.  Eloise felt an unexpected surge of excitement – maybe this time, she could make a real difference.
