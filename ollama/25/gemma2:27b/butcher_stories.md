The air hung thick with the cloying sweetness of blood and iron. It clung to Bartholomew "Barty" Grimley's apron, his calloused fingers, even the stray hairs escaping from beneath his butcher's cap. Outside, dawn was breaking over Blackwood Market, painting the cobblestone streets a sickly yellow-grey. But inside Grimley's Butcher Shop, the only light came from flickering oil lamps hanging precariously above slabs of glistening meat. 

Barty whistled a tuneless melody as he sharpened his cleaver, the rhythmic scrape echoing through the otherwise silent shop. He wasn't one for idle chatter, especially not before sunrise. The market wouldn't wake for another hour, and until then, it was just him and the carcasses â€“ a symphony of flesh and bone waiting to be transformed into sustenance.
