The flickering neon sign outside "Discount Dreams Emporium" buzzed insistently like an agitated hornet. Rain lashed against the grimy windowpanes, blurring the image of a grinning cartoon cactus holding aloft a suspiciously large inflatable flamingo. Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright sighed, tucking a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and straightening the name tag that read "Evie â€“ Let Me Help You Find Your Dreams!" 

Evelyn wasn't entirely convinced Discount Dreams Emporium actually dealt in dreams. More often than not, she felt like she was peddling disappointment disguised as bargains: chipped porcelain figurines with missing limbs, dusty board games with missing pieces, and inflatable flamingos that inevitably sprung leaks the first time someone dared to sit on them.  

Still, she needed the job. Rent in this part of the city wasn't cheap, even if your apartment was barely bigger than a walk-in closet. And besides, she liked the challenge. Evelyn Beatrice Cartwright wasn't one to give up easily. Today, however, the storm seemed to mirror her own dreary mood. Just as she braced herself for another wave of bored customers, the bell above the door jingled, announcing a newcomer.
