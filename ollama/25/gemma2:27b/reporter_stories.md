Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of the dive bar, blurring the neon glow of the "Open 24 Hours" sign. The air inside was thick with cigarette smoke and despair, punctuated by the occasional slurred laugh from a patron hunched over a chipped glass. Beatrice "Bee" Holloway, her trench coat dripping onto the worn linoleum floor, took a long swig of lukewarm coffee, grimacing at its bitterness.

Bee wasn't here for the ambiance. She was chasing a story - a whisper, really - about a string of strange occurrences in the city's forgotten alleyways. Disappearances. Unexplained noises. A chilling sense of being watched. The cops were calling it vagrancy, but Bee smelled something rotten beneath the surface.  She needed a lead, and she suspected this bar, a haven for those who lived on the fringes, might hold the key.
