Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Elara Finch's studio apartment, blurring the cityscape beyond into a watercolour wash of greys and yellows.  A symphony of car horns and distant sirens provided an unsettling soundtrack to Elara's frantic brushstrokes. On her easel, a canvas pulsed with vibrant colours – a riot of crimson poppies against a sapphire sky. Yet, despite the vibrancy of her work, a deep unease settled in Elara's stomach. 

She was due to unveil this piece, "Crimson Requiem", at the prestigious Blackwood Gallery tomorrow night, an opportunity she had poured her heart and soul into securing. But tonight, doubt gnawed at her like a relentless rat. Was it good enough? Would they understand the raw emotion she poured onto the canvas – the grief for her lost brother, the yearning for a brighter future? The rain seemed to mirror her turmoil, each drop hammering another nail into the coffin of her confidence.
