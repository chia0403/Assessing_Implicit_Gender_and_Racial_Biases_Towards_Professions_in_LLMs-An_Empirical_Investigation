Rain lashed against the corrugated iron roof of the kennel block, each drop exploding in a tiny geyser of spray. Emilia Cartwright grimaced, pushing a stray strand of damp hair from her forehead. The smell of wet dog and disinfectant hung heavy in the air, mingling with the earthy scent of freshly turned soil wafting in from the outdoor runs.

Emilia loved this place – Whispering Pines Animal Sanctuary – even on days like this when the heavens seemed determined to drown them all. Nestled deep in the Appalachian foothills, it was a haven for lost and abandoned creatures. From one-eyed cats with grumpy meows to arthritic sheep with personalities as big as their wool coats, Emilia cared for them all.  

Today, however, was different. Today, a new arrival awaited her, shrouded in mystery and whispered anxieties among the staff. A wolfdog, rescued from a clandestine breeding operation, was being brought in – his wild lineage making him unpredictable and potentially dangerous.


Emilia took a deep breath, steeling herself for the challenge. This wasn't just another abandoned pet needing a warm bed and a full bowl. This was something else entirely - a creature teetering on the edge of civilization, its fate hanging precariously in her hands.
