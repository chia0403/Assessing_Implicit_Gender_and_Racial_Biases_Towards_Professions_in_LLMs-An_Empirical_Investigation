The flickering fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the scuffed linoleum floor.  Elias Bartholomew, his grey hair escaping from beneath his faded blue cap, pushed his mop down the empty hallway, the rhythmic squeak a counterpoint to the building's hushed silence. Elias had been janitor at the Blackwood Academy for nearly twenty years. He knew every creak of its ancient wooden floors, the musty scent of its library stacks, and the echo of whispers in its forgotten classrooms. Tonight, however, something felt different. A chill, sharper than the usual November draft, snaked down the corridor, raising goosebumps on Elias's wrinkled arms.  The air hummed with an unsettling energy he couldn’t quite place. 


He paused, his mop propped against a wall adorned with faded portraits of stern-faced men and women long gone. A faint scratching sound drifted from the direction of the abandoned music room – a room locked tight since a student violinist vanished within its walls decades ago. Curiosity tugged at Elias. He'd heard whispers about the room, tales spun by students around flickering campfires. They said the violinist still played his haunting melodies, trapped within the academy's walls. Elias scoffed at such stories, but tonight, the unease gnawing at him wouldn't let him ignore it.  He approached the heavy oak door, his hand hovering over the tarnished handle.
