Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Theodore "Theo" Albright's office, blurring the already dim cityscape into an impressionistic watercolour.  The incessant drumming was a fitting soundtrack to Theo's mood. Spreadsheets lay open on his desk, each cell filled with numbers that swam before his weary eyes. April 15th loomed like a monstrous deadline, and Theo, despite years of diligently balancing ledgers for others, felt utterly adrift in his own financial chaos.

His cramped office, tucked away on the third floor of a fading brick building, mirrored the state of his life: cluttered, outdated, and desperately in need of renovation. Stacks of tax forms threatened to topple over, interspersed with half-eaten sandwiches and empty coffee cups. The air hung thick with the scent of stale paper and desperation. Theo rubbed his tired eyes, wishing for nothing more than a moment of peace, a sip of something stronger than lukewarm instant coffee, and perhaps a glimmer of hope that he wouldn't end up buried under an avalanche of paperwork come midnight.
