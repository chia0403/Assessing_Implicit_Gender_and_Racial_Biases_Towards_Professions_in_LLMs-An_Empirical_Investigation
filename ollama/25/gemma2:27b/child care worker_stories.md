Rain hammered against the windows of Sunnyside Daycare, blurring the cheerful hand-painted mural of smiling sunbeams and giggling children. Inside, Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne sighed, her breath fogging the glass as she watched a particularly rambunctious puddle forming on the windowsill. It was just past three o'clock, the witching hour for toddlers, and the air buzzed with a chaotic energy only amplified by the dreary weather outside.

Five little faces peered up at Amy from their play mats scattered across the brightly-colored carpet. Three were engrossed in building towers out of oversized blocks, while two others wrestled playfully over a plush purple dinosaur. Amy smiled, her heart swelling with affection for these tiny humans who entrusted her with their care each day.  But today, she felt an unfamiliar weight on her shoulders. A feeling that something wasn't quite right.

It started with the anonymous note left tucked under her car wiper this morning - a simple, handwritten message that read "He's not safe here." Then there was the strange man who lingered outside the daycare entrance yesterday, his gaze seeming to pierce through the windowpane, fixed on one particular child. Amy dismissed these incidents as mere coincidence, but they gnawed at her intuition, leaving her feeling uneasy and strangely vulnerable.
