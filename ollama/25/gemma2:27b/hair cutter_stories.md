The pungent aroma of chemical relaxer mingled with lavender shampoo hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that always seemed to cling to Eloise Bernadette Thibodeaux's clothes long after she'd left the salon. Outside, rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Eloise's Emporium of Elegance," blurring the neon sign that pulsed like a heart.  

Eloise, her hands still slick with styling gel, surveyed the wreckage of her latest masterpiece - a fiery red bob gone awry due to Mrs. Delacroix's insistence on using home dye before her appointment. Eloise sighed. It wouldn't be the last time she'd have to wrestle rebellious locks into submission.  

But tonight felt different. A low thrumming vibrated in the air, a sensation that prickled Eloise's skin and sent shivers down her spine. The power flickered momentarily, plunging the salon into an unsettling gloom before sputtering back to life. As Eloise turned the lock on the door, bracing herself for another onslaught of New Orleans humidity, she swore she heard a whisper carried on the wind - a voice, laced with both urgency and sorrow, calling her name.
