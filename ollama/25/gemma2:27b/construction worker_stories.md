The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Thorne's neck, turning his skin pink beneath the grime. Dust motes danced in the air, catching the harsh light as Eli wrestled another beam into place. The skeleton of the new skyscraper stretched skyward, glinting like a steel and glass ribcage against the cloudless blue. Below him, the city sprawled out in a concrete and asphalt mosaic, punctuated by splashes of green parkland. But Eli couldn't see any of it. His focus was on the beam, the weight pulling at his muscles, the rhythmic clang of hammer against metal echoing around him.

He squinted, sweat stinging his eyes. This job, this skyscraper, it was supposed to be a stepping stone. A chance for him to prove himself, earn enough money to finally leave this city and its ghosts behind. But today, with every grunt and groan as he heaved another beam into position, the weight of the past felt heavier than any steel girder.
