Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Amelia Harding's office, mimicking the turmoil brewing within her own chest. The antique grandfather clock in the corner ticked with an unnerving precision, each chime echoing the mounting anxiety gnawing at her insides. Outside, London was drowning in a grey November deluge, mirroring the storm raging inside her mind.

Amelia wasn't afraid of difficult patients. In her years as a clinical psychologist at the prestigious Harley Street Clinic, she had faced down countless demons – phobias, traumas, addictions. But this case, this one gnawed at her like no other. It was unlike anything she'd encountered before: cryptic symbols scrawled on the patient's intake form, unsettling pronouncements of a "shadow world" intersecting with reality, and a chilling air of certainty about an impending doom. Amelia wasn't sure what scared her more – the patient's claims or her own growing sense that there might be something to them.
