Rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Eleanor Vance's tiny apartment, each drop a miniature drum solo drowning out the city’s usual hum.  Eleanor herself was oblivious to the downpour, her eyes glued to the flickering screen before her. Lines of code scrolled past, green on black, an intricate tapestry woven by her fingers flying across the keyboard.  A half-eaten bowl of ramen sat neglected beside her overflowing coffee mug, a testament to the hours she’d already poured into debugging this stubborn algorithm.

Eleanor was no stranger to late nights hunched over her computer, but this project felt different. This wasn't just another game, app, or website for some faceless corporation. This was something personal, something born from a spark of grief and a flicker of hope. 


This was Eleanor’s attempt to bring her grandmother back, at least in digital form.
