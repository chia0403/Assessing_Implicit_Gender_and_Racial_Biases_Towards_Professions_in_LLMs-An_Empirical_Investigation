Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Beatrice "Bea" Hawthorne's office, mimicking the storm brewing inside her. Her desk, usually a meticulously organized haven of paperwork and post-it notes, was littered with case files: parole violations, missed appointments, accusations of drug use. Bea rubbed her temples, trying to stave off the headache that threatened to split her skull in two.

The air hung heavy with desperation and frustration, the smell of stale coffee mingling with the faint scent of bleach struggling to mask the underlying odor of poverty and despair.

But five years in, she was starting to wonder if she was fighting a losing battle. The system felt stacked against her clients, their struggles magnified by societal inequalities and systemic biases.
