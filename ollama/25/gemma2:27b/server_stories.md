The air hung thick with the scent of frying onions and desperation. Amelia "Amy" Cartwright expertly navigated the crowded floor of The Rusty Spatula, dodging clattering plates and exasperated sighs from her fellow servers. It was Friday night, prime time for chaos, and Amy, with her perpetual smile and lightning-fast reflexes, was in her element. 

The greasy spoon diner was a relic of a bygone era – red vinyl booths cracked with age, chipped Formica tables sticky with spilled milkshakes, and a jukebox belting out forgotten rock 'n' roll hits. Outside, the neon "Open" sign flickered erratically, casting an unsettling green glow on the rain-slicked asphalt.


Amy balanced a tray laden with steaming burgers and fries, weaving through the hungry patrons like a seasoned acrobat. Tonight, though, something felt different. A nervous energy thrummed beneath her skin, a feeling she couldn't quite place. Perhaps it was the lone figure hunched in booth number six, shrouded in shadow and emitting an aura of unsettling stillness. Or maybe it was the persistent thumping coming from the alley behind the diner – a sound too regular to be natural. 

Whatever it was, Amy knew this Friday night wouldn't be like any other.
