The air hung heavy with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Bartholomew "Bart" Quillingham squinted at the sky, its cerulean expanse already bruised with streaks of violet. He knew this garden like the back of his gnarled hand, each twist in the ancient oak's branches, every bloom on the rose trellis, a familiar comfort. Yet today, something felt different. A prickling unease danced along Bart's spine as he surveyed the manicured lawns and vibrant flower beds of Thornwood Manor.

Bart was no stranger to the whims of nature or the eccentricities of the manor's inhabitants. For forty years, he had tended this sprawling estate, his love for the earth a constant in a world that often felt chaotic. But today, the silence seemed unnervingly deep. The usual symphony of birdsong was muted, replaced by the rhythmic drip-drop from a weeping willow's leaves. Even the wind, usually a playful companion, held its breath.
