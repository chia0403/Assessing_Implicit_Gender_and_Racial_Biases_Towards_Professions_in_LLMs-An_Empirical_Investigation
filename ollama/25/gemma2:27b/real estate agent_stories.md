The humid Charleston air hung heavy, thick with the scent of jasmine and saltwater. Emilia Beauregard wiped a bead of sweat from her brow, pushing back a stray curl that had escaped her meticulously styled bun. The grand Victorian mansion before her loomed like a spectral queen, its peeling paint and overgrown azaleas whispering tales of forgotten grandeur. This was "Magnolia Manor," the latest listing in Emilia's already impressive portfolio.  She adjusted her designer sunglasses, hoping they concealed the flicker of doubt that had begun to gnaw at her. Selling a decaying behemoth like this wouldn't be easy. Yet, beneath the years of neglect, Emilia saw the bones of something truly magnificent â€“ a testament to Charleston's rich history waiting for someone with vision to awaken it.  

And she was determined to find them.
