Rain hammered against the bay window of Dr. Eleanor Vance's dental practice, blurring the neon sign that proclaimed "Smiles For Miles" in cheerful green script. Inside, the waiting room was deserted save for Eleanor herself, perched on the edge of her ergonomic chair and drumming her fingers impatiently on the armrest. The digital clock blinked 5:58 p.m., mockingly counting down the last two minutes before she could finally lock up and escape the dreary day.

Eleanor sighed, the weight of another missed dinner date pressing down on her chest. Her boyfriend, David, a charming architect with a penchant for spontaneous weekend trips, was probably already halfway through their reservation at that trendy new Italian place downtown. She'd sent him a text earlier, explaining about an emergency root canal that had thrown off her schedule, but she knew he wouldn't understand. He never understood the unpredictable nature of her work, how a simple checkup could unravel into a multi-hour procedure with unforeseen complications.

Suddenly, the door creaked open, and Eleanor jolted upright, startled by the unexpected visitor. A figure, shrouded in shadow from the relentless rain, stepped hesitantly into the waiting room.  Eleanor squinted through the gloom, recognizing the unmistakable silhouette of Mrs. Hawthorne, her oldest and most peculiar patient.
