He squinted through the dust swirling around him, the cab of his Caterpillar 349 excavator offering little reprieve from the Arizona heat. The vast expanse of red earth before him stretched towards distant mesas, dotted with hardy scrub and twisted juniper trees. Sly was carving out the foundation for a new solar farm, each scoop of the massive machine's claw bringing him closer to completing another stage in a project that felt simultaneously monumental and mundane.

Sly had always found solace in the rhythm of the engine, the controlled power at his fingertips, the satisfaction of seeing something tangible rise from the earth. But today, a restlessness gnawed at him, a feeling that there was more to life than moving dirt and pouring concrete. He glanced up at the cloudless sky, its endless blue mocking his own sense of confinement.
