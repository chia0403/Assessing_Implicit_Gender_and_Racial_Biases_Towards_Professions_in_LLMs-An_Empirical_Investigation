Rain lashed against the dusty windows of Esmeralda Thorne's atelier, blurring the already faded grandeur of Montmartre. Inside, the air hung heavy with the scent of lavender water and singed silk, a comforting aroma that had permeated every inch of her life for as long as she could remember. Esmeralda, her auburn braid falling over one shoulder like a flame against her charcoal smock, hunched over a mannequin draped in emerald velvet. Her needle, a silver gleam in the weak light filtering through the rain-streaked glass, darted in and out of the fabric with practiced ease, each stitch drawing her closer to the vision in her mind: a gown fit for a queen, or at least a Parisian courtesan who dreamed of being one. 


The doorbell chimed, a discordant note against the rhythmic patter of rain. Esmeralda sighed, momentarily breaking her concentration. She knew it wouldn't be Madame Dubois, her usual late-afternoon client. The wealthy socialite wouldn't dare venture out in this weather. Curiosity piqued, Esmeralda wiped her needle on a scrap of linen and descended the creaky stairs, anticipation tinged with a prickle of unease.  Who would seek out a dressmaker in such a storm?
