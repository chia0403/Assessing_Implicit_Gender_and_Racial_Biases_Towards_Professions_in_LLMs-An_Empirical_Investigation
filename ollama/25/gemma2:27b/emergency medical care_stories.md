Rain lashed against the ambulance windows, blurring the already dim city lights into impressionistic streaks of yellow and red. Amelia "Amy" Ramirez gripped the steering wheel tighter, her knuckles white against the worn leather. Sirens wailed, a mournful counterpoint to the relentless drumming of the rain. 

The call had come in just minutes ago: a multi-vehicle collision on the slick freeway overpass. Amy's gut clenched. Overpasses were notorious for turning into death traps in bad weather. She glanced at her partner, Jake, who was calmly checking their equipment, his face impassive behind his thick beard. He'd seen enough accidents to know better than to let anxiety cloud his judgment.  

As they hurtled towards the scene, Amy couldn't shake the feeling that this call was going to be different. This one felt...heavy. The weight of impending disaster pressed down on her like the oppressive humidity clinging to the city air.
