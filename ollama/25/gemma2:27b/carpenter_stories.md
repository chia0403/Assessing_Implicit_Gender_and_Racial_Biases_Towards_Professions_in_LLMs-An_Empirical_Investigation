The air in Silas Blackwood's workshop was thick with the scent of cedar and sawdust. Sunlight streamed through the grimy windowpanes, illuminating the motes dancing in its wake. Tools hung neatly on the pegboard walls, each one polished to a gleam: planes, chisels, saws, hammers â€“ a symphony of woodcraft waiting to be played. Silas himself, his face creased with a lifetime's worth of smiles and scowls, was hunched over a workbench, his calloused hands shaping a piece of walnut into the graceful curve of a rocking chair armrest.

The rhythmic tap-tap-tap of his hammer echoed through the small space, punctuated by the occasional scrape of sandpaper. Outside, the bustling marketplace of Oakhaven hummed with activity, but in here, time seemed to stand still. Silas was lost in his work, each precise cut and smooth stroke a testament to his years of experience and unwavering love for the craft. But today, a familiar unease gnawed at him. A letter lay unopened on the bench beside him, the wax seal bearing the crest of Lord Elmsworth. It promised a commission, a grand one, but Silas hesitated. Such projects always brought complications, and he'd rather be content with his simple life, crafting chairs for local folk and mending broken toys. Yet, something in the letter's crisp script and weighty feel tugged at him, whispering of a challenge too tempting to resist.
