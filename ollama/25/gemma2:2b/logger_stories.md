The air hung thick with the smell of pine and damp earth as young Elias Blackwood hacked at the towering redwood. He wasn't your typical lumberjack.  His father had taught him the art of cutting wood with a quiet precision, his hands moving like the dance of the wind through the trees. A few years ago, heâ€™d turned down the chance to follow in his brother's footsteps into the booming sawmills of Northern California, choosing instead the solitude of the Oregon Coast rainforest.  He was content with the life - rugged, raw, but peaceful.

The forest stretched out before him, a symphony of emerald and jade, sunlight dappling through the leaves like a kaleidoscope. The roar of the chainsaw vibrated in his chest, a familiar comfort. Elias adjusted his worn leather cap, pulling down the collar to shield his eyes from the intense sun. This was where he felt truly alive, at one with the ancient giants that guarded his solitude. He ran a callused hand through his dark, unruly hair, his focus unwavering as he shifted his weight and started on a new section of redwood. 


Elias Blackwood, son of woodcarver Silas Blackwood and granddaughter of a woman who knew every tree by its bark.
