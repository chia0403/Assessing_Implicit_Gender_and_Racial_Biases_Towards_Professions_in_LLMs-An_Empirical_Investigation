The air in "Nails & Wishes" was thick with the scent of citrus polish remover and simmering disappointment.  Evelyn "Eve" Nightingale, her brow furrowed beneath a curtain of auburn hair escaping from its messy bun, surveyed her reflection in the chipped chrome of a small vanity mirror. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple as she nervously chewed on the tip of her bright pink nail. The usual Saturday rush was dead slow.  Just like last Friday, and the week before that...and the week after that.  It had been a dry spell for months. 


The small salon in the quiet suburb was nestled amongst the quaint flower shops and bustling cafes of Maple Creek, a place where everyone knew everyone's life story, their dreams (and their deepest insecurities), whispered on the wind as it swept through the trees lining Maple Street. Eve, with her quick hands and even quicker wit, had become something of an unofficial confidante to the women of Maple Creek – a haven from their husbands' nagging or children's whining. Yet today, she felt trapped by a sense of melancholy that seemed to cling to her like yesterday's polish. Even the cheerful chatter of Mrs. Henderson gossiping about the town council meeting couldn’t break the silence around her.
