Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek Animal Sanctuary, a steady rhythm accompanying the low moan of wind whistling through the trees. Inside, Evelyn "Evie" Blackwood, with her apron splattered brown from years of handling muddy paw prints and spilled milk, hummed softly as she inspected the latest batch of rescued baby goats. A storm like this one was an annual tradition in their little corner of rural Oregon, but this year felt different, heavier than usual, like the weight of a hundred unseen clouds pressed down on her.  

The sanctuary wasn't just a place for shelter; it was a haven for unwanted and abandoned creatures â€“ stray cats with missing ears, feral dogs found with mangled paws, even rescued ostriches who preferred to pace the confines of their enclosure. Each animal had a story, and Evie listened, her heart filling with warmth for those whose lives were now intertwined with hers. The sanctuary was more than just a job; it was an oasis in the wilderness of humanity's neglect. And yet, tonight, even its comforting presence felt strained against the backdrop of this impending storm.
