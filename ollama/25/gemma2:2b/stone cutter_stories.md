The air hung heavy with the scent of wet granite and dust, the familiar aroma that clung to Elara like an old friend.  Sunlight filtered through the cracks in her workshop’s ramshackle walls, casting long shadows on the rough stone blocks stacked haphazardly within. The sun was setting, staining the sky a fiery orange as she worked, her calloused fingers tracing patterns onto a slab of amethyst. 

Elara Stonehand, they called her - not just for her nimble hands that moved with the precision of a sculptor's, but also for the inherent strength and resilience that seemed to emanate from her very being. A decade ago, she had carved her first stone into existence, and since then, she had dedicated herself to honing her craft. 

Today, though, something felt different. The amethyst wasn’t just a piece of raw material; it was an echo of the unknown that lingered in Elara's heart – a feeling as vast and ancient as the mountains themselves. As she ran her fingers over its surface, tracing the vein of dark purple across the stone, she knew this could be more than mere work; it could be something…more.  

**Setting:** A small, isolated town nestled in the foothills of the rugged mountain range. The air is thick with history and a palpable sense of quiet wonder.
