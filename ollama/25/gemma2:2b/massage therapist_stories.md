The rhythmic whirring of the massager in Amelia's hands was a soundtrack to her thoughts.  It was always like this – calm pressure against tense muscles, the gentle rasp of scraping away knots, the smell of eucalyptus and lavender clinging to the air – all part of the tapestry she wove for each client. Today, however, the usual symphony felt out of sync. 

Amelia ran a hand through her dark hair, the setting sun painting streaks of orange and purple across the room. The massage therapy clinic was tucked away in the corner of a bustling city block, nestled amongst a cluster of antique stores, flower shops, and a vintage bookshop. It wasn't exactly a haven for anonymity, but it was just right:  a place where Amelia could melt into a rhythm that felt both familiar and strangely unsettling.

Tonight, though, she had an unusual client. Mr. Eldridge, the old man who had arrived on crutches, his eyes shadowed with worry as he spoke of a "painful knot" in his soul – something that needed untangling. Amelia's usual clientele was mostly stressed city dwellers looking for a respite from their busy lives.  Mr. Eldridge, however, held a weight no massage could dissolve, a secret he kept locked away in the creases of his worn face. The setting sun cast long shadows across the room as Amelia stared into Mr. Eldridge's eyes, a knot of her own growing in her stomach – she was about to delve deeper than usual, and it felt like stepping into an uncharted territory.
