The crisp air clung to Clara's face as she crossed the threshold of the Blackwood Manor. Dust motes danced in the sliver of sunlight that pierced through the grime-coated windows of the grand foyer. Stepping into the sprawling house always felt like stepping back in time, the worn velvet curtains and creaky floorboards whispering secrets from a forgotten era. Clara, known to the locals as "Ma'am" by Mrs. Blackwood herself, was used to this routine.  It wasn’t glamourous work, but there was something oddly comforting about maintaining the meticulous order of a life long gone. 

This day, however, felt heavier than usual. A storm raged outside, mirroring the tumult in Clara's heart. Today, she was tasked with preparing for the annual Blackwood Ball, an event that had become as much a spectacle as it did a social obligation.  Her job wasn’t just about polishing silverware and dusting ornate paintings; it was about ensuring everything remained pristine, even under the weight of family trauma. 

Clara's heart sank as she caught sight of a single wilting rose in her work basket. It reminded her of Mrs. Blackwood's late husband, Edward, whose somber charm had been as much a part of the house as the dusty portraits hanging on the walls.  The rose was their symbol, a fragile reminder of love lost amidst the ever-present silence that now filled the manor.
