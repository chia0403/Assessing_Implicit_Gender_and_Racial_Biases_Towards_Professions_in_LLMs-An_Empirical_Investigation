The fluorescent lights hummed like bees trapped in an attic, casting a sickly yellow pallor over everything in Mr. Hawthorne's cramped corner at "Everything for Less".  That wasn't the worst part; it was the constant drone of the cash register, each click and whirr like a metronome marking time's relentless march toward oblivion.  His own name echoed back from that cold metallic box – not just “Mr. Hawthorne”, but *Edgar* Hawthorne – which felt more fitting when paired with his current reality.  He wished he could leave his post for the bustling street outside, the one where life had a tangible pulse to it, instead of this sterile, quiet purgatory.

His name was Edgar Hawthorne, and today's listless monotony was only broken by the incessant chirping of the tiny bird-shaped alarm clock on his cubicle wall. It chimed twice, its cheerful little melody a mocking reminder that 10:42 pm had arrived - his shift was almost over. This wasn't how he envisioned spending his evenings; escaping into fantasy novels and escapism through his worn copy of "A Farewell to Arms", yet here he was, another day swallowed by the routine-driven drudgery of being a cashier at Everything for Less.
