The air hung thick with sugar and the sweet scent of melting buttercream in the quaint little shop "Sweet Delights."  Rain lashed against the bakery window, mimicking the chaotic drumming of Amelia's fingers on the icing spatula. It was a Tuesday evening, usually a slow period for any bakery, but tonight felt different. Tonight, Amelia’s world was about to become one giant sugar rush. 

Amelia Rose Hawthorne was not your average baker.  While her mother and grandmother had poured their lifeblood into creating classic cakes, Amelia found herself drawn to the artistry of decorating, her creations a riot of swirling flowers and cascading buttercream leaves. A delicate porcelain cake with hand-painted sunflowers that graced the corner table, was Amelia's masterpiece - but tonight, it all felt… hollow. The usual symphony of orders and requests had died down, replaced by a strange hush.  The shop door creaked open to let in a gust of wind and a man whose presence seemed to stir up more than just the rain outside.

The atmosphere is generally cozy, with a focus on traditional baking techniques and classic recipes.
