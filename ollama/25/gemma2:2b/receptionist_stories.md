The fluorescent lights hummed overhead in the sterile office space, casting a sickly yellow glow over Amelia "Amy" Winthrop's worn desk.  Her fingers tapped out a staccato rhythm against the chipped Formica as she scrolled through the endless stream of unreturned calls, each one another reminder of her own small, invisible existence within the grand structure of Winthrop & Co. Architects. 

The city sweltered outside, radiating an oppressive heat from the asphalt and concrete that made up their building's skin. Amy wasn't a fan of summer in this part of the country;  it seemed to cling to every surface, turning her normally vibrant teal desk into a shimmering beacon of artificial humidity.  

The air hung thick with the scent of cheap coffee and stale ambitions, two scents that had become synonymous with Amy's daily grind. She longed for something more than answering calls about permits and blueprints, even though it was the bedrock upon which the world of architecture stood.  She craved a creative spark, a chance to breathe life into something beyond just the mundane routines of her job.
