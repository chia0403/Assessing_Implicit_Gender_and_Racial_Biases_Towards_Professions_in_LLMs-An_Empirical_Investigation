The crisp mountain air stung Dr. Amelia "Amy" Hawthorne's cheeks as she surveyed the vast expanse of snow-capped peaks, their jagged outlines stark against the cerulean sky.  The wind whipped through her worn leather coat, carrying the scent of pine and evergreen – scents that always brought a sense of grounding to Amy even when miles away from the bustling city. Her small clinic nestled in the foothills of these majestic mountains, surrounded by the quiet serenity of nature's embrace, offered a stark contrast to the high-pressure world she left behind when she finally decided to make this idyllic life her own. 

Today's case was a bit less tranquil, however.  A nervous young man named Ethan stood beside her, his gaze darting between Amy and his skittering dog, a Jack Russell terrier named Biscuit, who was pacing back and forth with growing agitation. "It's been... well, it’s been strange," Ethan had explained earlier, his voice laced with worry.  "My boy, he just... seems different lately. His appetite's off, he's restless, and he won't stop whining about the old man's coming."

Amy took a calming breath as she stroked Biscuit's fur, her eyes locked on Ethan’s worried face. This mountain town was all about tradition, but even in its simplicity, it always held a pulse of something that whispered about life's unseen mysteries.
