The stale air of the Citadel hung heavy with the musk of sweat and fear. Sergeant Kaelen Thorne adjusted his worn leather jerkin, its familiar weight a small comfort in the face of the city's escalating unrest. He stood at the outer gate, the stone archway casting long shadows across the bustling marketplace. The once lively street was now choked with nervous whispers and hurried footsteps as citizens scrambled to hide their treasures or leave for the safer confines of their homes. 

The tension had been brewing for weeks, ever since the King's decree banning all gatherings within city walls. But today, it felt different - a tangible knot of fear that tightened with each passing moment. Kaelen’s sharp eyes scanned the crowd, his years spent as a Citadel guard honing his instincts to a fine art.  He saw it: the familiar flash of metal, a hint of crimson stain on a worn cloak – the mark of the infamous Crimson Hand, notorious assassins who had terrorized the city's fringes for months now. 

A chill ran down Kaelen’s spine as he heard a guttural growl from beyond the crowd, accompanied by a sharp whistle and the clattering of metal against stone. The whispers turned into panicked screams as more figures emerged from the chaos, their faces obscured by hoods. This wasn't a simple act of robbery anymore; this was something much worse – an attempt at sabotage. 


**Setting:**  The Citadel - a fortified city with a sprawling marketplace, bustling streets and towering walls that once held a promise of safety. Now, fear hangs in the air like smoke on a windy day. 
**Main character:** Kaelen Thorne - A seasoned guard, scarred from years of dealing with violence, yet still holding onto a flicker of hope for a better tomorrow.
