##  The Whispers in the Walls

Rain lashed against the sky, mirroring the storm brewing within Dr. Amelia Sinclair's office.  A single bare bulb cast an anemic yellow light across her desk where stacks of files overflowed like unruly children’s toys. Outside, the air thrummed with tension as thunder boomed and lightning cracked the sky in jagged flashes. It was this kind of day that made Dr. Sinclair feel a strange kinship with the children she served – all lost in their own internal storms. 

She ran a weary hand through her already frazzled hair, the weight of another chaotic school year pressing down on her like an unyielding brick wall.  Amelia’s focus had always been meticulous, finding order amidst the chaos of adolescent behavior. But this year felt different. The whispers in the walls seemed to carry more urgency, each echoing concern a little heavier than before. It was as if even the silence itself held its breath, waiting for something catastrophic. 

The storm outside intensified, mirroring the tempest brewing within Amelia’s own mind.  This year, she'd been struck by an unexpected case: Daniel Thompson, a seemingly bright and charming seventh-grader with a mischievous glint in his eyes that now seemed clouded with something far deeper. It was as if he had swallowed an entire universe of unspoken fears and anxieties. The weight of those whispers was becoming too much for Amelia to ignore.
