Rain lashed against the bakery windows, blurring the quaint streetlights into halos of amber light.  The air inside was thick with the scent of warm bread and cinnamon, but even that couldn't penetrate the cold that clung to Amelia Blackwood like an old shawl. She ran her calloused hands over a mound of dough, its softness betraying the harshness of the storm raging outside. "Patience, Amelia," she muttered, her voice rough from years spent battling both flour and wind in equal measure. 

The tiny town of Willow Creek was as cozy as its name suggested - a place where time seemed to move slower, where lives were woven into the rhythm of seasons. The bakery, nestled on a cobblestone street with crooked houses painted in hues of faded red and blue, had been Amelia's family legacy for generations. But even the warmth of her ovens couldn't dispel the icy dread that chilled her bones, a premonition whispering against the backdrop of the storm.  Tonight was the night, she knew, but it felt far too heavy to bear.
