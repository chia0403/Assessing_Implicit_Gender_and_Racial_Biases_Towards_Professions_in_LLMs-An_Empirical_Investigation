## Opening Scene

**Setting:**  The sterile, fluorescent-lit hallways of Mercy General Hospital echo with hushed voices and the rhythmic beeping of heart monitors. The air hangs heavy with anticipation and a faint scent of disinfectant, masking any hint of genuine human warmth. Rain lashes against the windows, blurring the city skyline into an impressionistic mess of grey. 

**Main Character:** Eleanor “Ellie” Thorne, RN. Her steely gaze constantly scans the ward, her hands always stained with ink or a smear of antiseptic.  A veteran nurse at Mercy General, Ellie has seen it all - births, deaths, and everything in between. Yet, tonight, her usual calm is frayed. A cold, clinical dread settles over her like a shroud as she walks towards Room 302.

**Story Opening:**  A single flickering light above the bed reveals the silhouette of a woman lying pale and frail, clutching a worn teddy bear with one hand. The name tag reads: "Alice Beaumont." Ellie's pulse quickens. She remembers Alice's cheerful face from the community centre where she volunteered to read stories to underprivileged children. Now, the room’s starkness amplifies the image of faded hope and unspoken fear in Alice's eyes. 

Ellie knows this case is different. It isn't just another patient battling a stubborn infection or a complex medical condition. There's a deeper unease simmering beneath the surface, something that threatens to engulf her professional world entirely.
