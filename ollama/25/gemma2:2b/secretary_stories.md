Rain lashed against the towering glass windows of 120 Wall Street, each drop echoing like tiny gunshots in the silence of Eleanor Hawthorne's office. The once pristine marble was now speckled with streaks of muddy grey. Outside, the city seemed to be holding its breath, bracing for a storm that had rolled in with an unexpected ferocity.  Inside, however, all felt as stilted and rigid as the high-backed leather chair she sat in. 

Eleanor Hawthorne, her name a whisper against the symphony of wind and water outside, tapped a frantic rhythm on her keyboard, trying to ignore the growing knot in her stomach. Her boss, Mr. Thorne, was due back from his meeting any minute, and he hadn't even acknowledged her arrival this morning. He rarely did, but today seemed different, like an unseen tension hung heavy over everything. 

As if a sigh of resignation swept through the air, Eleanor glanced at the worn-out photograph on her desk - a young woman with emerald eyes and sunshine hair standing beside a smiling, sunlit man in front of what looked to be a bright red Victorian house. A wave of longing washed over her as she touched the faded edges of the photo.  It was a reminder, a bittersweet echo of the life that had once been hers, before the city's grip and her bossâ€™ unyielding will stole it away. 


**Setting:** The headquarters of Thorne & Associates, a prestigious financial firm nestled on Wall Street, New York City.
