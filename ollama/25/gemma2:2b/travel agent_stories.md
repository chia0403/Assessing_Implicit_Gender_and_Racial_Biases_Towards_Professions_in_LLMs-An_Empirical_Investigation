## Setting the Stage:

The air in Amelia’s "Dream Destinations" office hummed with an odd kind of static, swirling around her as if caught in a miniature dust devil. Sunlight streamed through the dusty window panes, casting stark lines on the worn leather couch where Amelia sat, her head in her hands.  Outside, the cityscape bustled with a chaotic energy that contrasted sharply with the silence inside her tiny office. 

**Story Opening:**

Amelia ran her fingers through her auburn hair, each strand tangled like a question mark against her forehead. The world was on fire. Literally. Climate change had escalated to an alarming degree, causing global unrest and extreme weather events. Her once-thriving travel agency business was now in ruins. 

Just weeks ago, Amelia's heart soared as she helped book the dream trip of a lifetime for Ms. Peterson, an elderly woman who finally got to visit Paris after years of postponements. Now, her inbox overflowed with cancellations and frantic calls from worried families trying to reschedule their summer vacations. The once-vibrant brochures lay crumpled on the desk like wilting flowers, mocking her dwindling hope.

Amelia sighed. She was a dreamer, always pushing her clients towards faraway lands and exotic adventures. But even Amelia's imagination couldn’t conjure up a solution in this chaotic world where the dream of travelling seemed as distant as a star.   


**Character:**
