The steam rose from Amelia Thorne's coffee mug like wispy ghosts, mirroring the chill creeping into her bones on this December morning. The neon sign outside "Murphy’s Bar & Grill" pulsed a sickly green against the backdrop of rain-streaked city lights. She was perched at a rickety table tucked away in the corner, laptop open before her, its pale screen battling against the dimness.  This wasn't your typical city reporter's haunt; this was the local dive where secrets whispered and shadows deepened like the late hour. Amelia’s heart pounded with the anticipation of another scoop, just like it did every time she walked through those doors. 

Tonight, the news was bigger than usual: a fire at the abandoned mill on Elm Street. Not only was it a potential crime scene, but rumors whispered about the old building’s history – whispers of hushed dealings and forgotten tragedies. All Amelia knew was that her story had to be the first one to expose the truth.  And she wouldn't back down until she held it all in her hands - a reporter’s shield against the city's underbelly, ready for its next big reveal.
