The air hung heavy with the scent of disinfectant and a strange blend of fear and anticipation that usually accompanied Dr. Thompson’s patients. At least, it did at the start of his shift. Now, after a seemingly endless string of late-night emergencies, it was just the monotonous hum of the lab machines, the faint tap-tap-tap of Amelia's fingers on her worn-down notebook, and the echoing silence from the empty waiting room.  Her gaze darted between the overflowing blood bank, where the tubes were like fallen soldiers lined up in rows of crimson despair, and the single flickering light that marked the entryway to Dr. Thompson’s private office, a beacon of quiet darkness after a chaotic shift. 

Amelia "Amy" Carter was more than just a phlebotomist; she was a silent warrior, trained to extract life's essence without flinching, yet haunted by its fragility and the knowledge that her work often felt like playing God.  Her fingers, calloused from years of practice, had learned to navigate the veins with a touch of expertise, almost hypnotic in their precision. 

Tonight, however, she felt anything but calm. Tonight was different. A strange tremor ran through her usually stoic demeanor, a feeling that something was amiss, something bigger than just another blood draw. Dr. Thompson's office door clicked closed with an uncharacteristic quiet, and Amy's heart skipped a beat.
