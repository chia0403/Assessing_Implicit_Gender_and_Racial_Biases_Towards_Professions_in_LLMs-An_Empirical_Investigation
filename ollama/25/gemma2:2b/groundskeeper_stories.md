The late afternoon sun dripped like honey through the gnarled branches of the ancient oak, casting long shadows that danced across the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor. Bartholomew "Barty" Featherstone was hunched over his weeding patch, sweat clinging to his weathered brow and dirt caked in his beard. It was a task he'd grown weary of – the endless toil, the aching muscles, the ever-present threat of an errant mower or lawnmower from the neighboring estates. 

Barty, all five feet two inches of him, was a man of simple life and quiet purpose. He was a groundskeeper at Blackwood Manor, a sprawling estate built on a foundation of secrets and whispers. The manor's gardens were his solace, a haven where he could find peace amidst the looming shadows of history.  He dreamt of escaping the confines of the grounds – of traveling to distant lands or opening a small shop filled with rare herbs and forgotten seeds. But for now, the only horizon he saw was the one painted by the setting sun on the manicured lawns of Blackwood Manor.
