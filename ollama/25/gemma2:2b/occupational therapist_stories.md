## The Reclusive River 

The crisp morning air clung to Amelia Hawthorne's hair as she walked along the dirt path.  Sunlight dappled through the canopy of ancient oaks, casting dancing shadows across the moss-covered stones.  Her weathered boots crunched softly on the gravel driveway of Riverbend Cottage, a ramshackle structure perched precariously on the banks of the Whispering River.  It was here Amelia found solace, her sanctuary from the bustling world and its demands for productivity. 

Riverbend was Amelia's domain – a haven where she could reconnect with nature’s raw power, untangle complex human emotions through movements and touch, and ultimately help others find their own resilience in the face of adversity.  She had been drawn to occupational therapy after years volunteering at a children's hospital, her heart aching for the ways kids were trapped by limitations they couldn’t control. 

As Amelia reached the cottage door, its weathered wood creaked open with an almost theatrical groan. The scent of pine needles and cinnamon clung to the air inside, a nostalgic aroma that brought a smile to her lips.  But today, the usual comfort was overshadowed by a weight she hadn't anticipated – a sense of urgency mixed with a creeping fear.  The familiar tranquility of Riverbend was being challenged by an unexpected visitor.
