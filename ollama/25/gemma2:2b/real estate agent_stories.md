The flickering neon sign outside cast an almost-neon hue over **Amelia "Amy" Sterling's** tired face as she stared out across the bustling street. The aroma of frying onion rings wafting from a nearby diner was lost in the symphony of honking horns and chatter, a soundtrack to her daily grind.  Her beat: the old Victorian houses along Elmwood Street - their faded glory an ever-present enigma for this real estate agent. 

Today, though, the usual melancholy of Elmwood’s quiet decay was intensified by the swirling storm brewing overhead.  It wasn't just rain; it felt like the weight of forgotten hopes and dreams settling on Amy's shoulders with every gust. Her latest listing - a sprawling Victorian with peeling paint and overgrown jasmine vines that had been passed down through generations - was as much a reflection of the neighborhood itself: burdened with history, longing for change, but unsure how to embrace it.  The storm seemed to be mirroring the tension swirling within Amy's own chest.  She'd been burnt before.  But this one… this one felt different.
