The scent of eucalyptus oil hung heavy in the air as Dr. Eleanor "Ellie" Sterling stepped into her private practice's waiting room. Sunlight filtered through dusty blinds, illuminating the faded floral patterns on the upholstery. Outside, Chicago hummed with its usual frenetic energy – traffic roared past the building on Michigan Avenue, and sirens wailed periodically, a low-grade symphony of urban life.  But inside, the air was thick with the weight of anxieties, each patient's story waiting to be unearthed. Ellie smoothed down her worn lab coat, trying to ignore the lingering scent of lavender and cinnamon that clung to her like an unwanted ghost from one session to the next.

The waiting room door creaked open, bringing in a woman who looked as though she had been walking through a personal storm for weeks. Her eyes were red-rimmed, her shoulders slumped under the weight of something unspoken. She was carrying a small handbag clutched tightly to her chest – a silent protest against the storm raging within. As Ellie's gaze met hers, a wave of understanding washed over the doctor. The woman's story, however difficult it might be, was about to begin its slow unraveling in Ellie's office.
