## The Bite Back

**Setting:**  A cramped, bustling office in a run-down part of Pittsburgh. 

**Character:** **Eleanor "Ellie" Montgomery**, a sharp-tongued, fiercely independent dental hygienist with a passion for saving her patients' pearly whites and keeping them from becoming the next victim of a bad gum disease conspiracy. 

Ellie adjusted the straps on her worn leather satchel, its contents – disinfecting wipes, gauze packs, and an ancient yet cherished pocketknife she swore could cut through anything –  clattering against its side like a nervous bird's wings. Outside the window, rain battered against the grimy glass, mimicking the relentless beat of her heart as she awaited Dr. Henderson's arrival. 

Ellie had been working at this clinic for years, navigating the treacherous waters of poverty-stricken neighborhoods and dealing with their patients' diverse anxieties about dental hygiene. She knew that a healthy smile wasn't just about clean teeth, it was about dignity, hope, and the confidence to face life’s challenges with a bit more swagger.  Yet today, she couldn't shake off a nagging sense of unease. Something felt different, like a shadow lurking at the edge of her vision. 

Dr. Henderson entered, his usual jovial demeanor dimmed by a furrow on his brow. "Ellie," he began, his voice grave, "I need you to look into Mrs. Campbell's case." 

Ellie's eyebrows shot up. This wasn't just about a routine check-up; there was something off. Something that went beyond the usual complaints of chipped enamel and receding gums.  Something...bite back.
