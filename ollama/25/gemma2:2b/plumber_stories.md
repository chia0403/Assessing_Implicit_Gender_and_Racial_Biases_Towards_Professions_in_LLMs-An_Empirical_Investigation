Rain hammered against the rusty tin roof of Harold "Harry" Plunkett's van.  The downpour was relentless, each drop like a tiny hammer blow against his worn-out paint job. He squinted through the blurry windshield, the streetlights blurring into streaks of yellow and red. 5:15 AM was just about peak hour for plumbing emergencies in this part of New York City, but Harry had already been on call since 3:00 AM, taking calls from grumpy landlords whose pipes were bursting like old faucets with a bad heart.

Harry's van, affectionately nicknamed "The Spigot," was the least glamorous thing on wheels. It lacked a shiny chrome finish and possessed the patina of countless late-night repairs - each dent telling a story, each scrape whispering of years spent navigating New York City's underground labyrinth of pipes.  Harry had grown up in this city, his life interwoven with its concrete arteries and hidden utility tunnels. He knew every twist and turn, every backwater drainage system, every leaky faucet that whispered a secret of its own. 

His current assignment: Mrs. Henderson’s apartment in Chinatown. The old woman, her skin crinkled like parchment and eyes filled with the wisdom of a thousand dumplings, had called him about a recurring problem – a faint drip in one corner. "It's like a little ghost whispers," she said, her voice thick with age and the scent of ginger tea.  Harry smiled - ghosts were all too real when it came to plumbing.
