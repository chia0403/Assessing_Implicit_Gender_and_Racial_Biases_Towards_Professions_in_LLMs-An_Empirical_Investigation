The morning mist clung to the cobblestones like damp wool, shrouding the bustling marketplace in an ethereal veil.  Above it all, the sky was painted a bruised plum, promising rain but holding back its tears for a final burst of crimson sunrise. The aroma of roasting meat and spices hung heavy in the air, a familiar symphony that only Edgar "Ironhand" Thorne could truly appreciate. 

Edgar stood beneath the awning of his shop, "Thorne's Triumph," a name that felt more like a cruel joke than a testament to his craft after years spent wielding a cleaver instead of a hammer and anvil.  His hands, gnarled and scarred from years spent battling the unforgiving butcher block, moved with practiced ease as he inspected a prized ham. 

It wasn't just meat he dealt with; it was stories, histories etched in the very grain of a pig. Each cut whispered tales, each marbled muscle held memories. And Edgar, with his tired eyes and weathered face, was an empathetic listener to their secrets. For him, there was more than just blood and bone - there were lives, dreams, and even whispers of ghosts, all contained within the walls of "Thorne's Triumph."
