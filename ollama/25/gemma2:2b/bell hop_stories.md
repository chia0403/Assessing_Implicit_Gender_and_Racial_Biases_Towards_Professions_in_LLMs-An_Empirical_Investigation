The air hung thick with the scent of lavender soap and despair in the Grand Hotel's lobby.  Rain hammered against the arched windows, each drop echoing like a hammer blow on Edgar Bellington's soul. He stood at attention, his crisp uniform feeling more like a straitjacket than a symbol of service. 

Edgar was anything but stiffly formal today. The weight of three hundred pounds and a million missed opportunities had made him seem twice the size.  He'd been here for four years, ever since he graduated from a prestigious (yet hopelessly outdated) bellhop school in Chicago.  The Grand Hotel, with its gilded facade and whispers of lost grandeur, was his life, his dream, his last resort. 

His name on a faded brass tag felt like a curse. It wasn't Edgar Bellington. It was just Edgar, forgotten, insignificant amidst the opulent chaos he worked to maintain. A lone figure in a sea of polished mahogany and fading silk. The world beyond the towering marble pillars seemed miles away, but tonight, it whispered promises. Tonight, under the storm-tossed sky, Edgar dared to imagine something more.  Somethingâ€¦ real.
