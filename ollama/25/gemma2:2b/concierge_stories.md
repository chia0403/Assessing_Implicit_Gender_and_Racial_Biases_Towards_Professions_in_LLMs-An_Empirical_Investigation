##  The Clockmaker's Shadow

**Setting:** A sprawling, Victorian-era hotel perched on a cliff overlooking the crashing waves of the Atlantic. The air was thick with salt and fog, and a perpetual chill clung to everything, even in the heart of summer. Inside, "The Leviathan," a colossal hotel boasting gilded hallways, ornate chandeliers, and hidden secrets behind every corner, buzzed with its usual bustling life.

**Main Character:**  Edgar Hawthorne III, or "Eggy" as his colleagues whispered behind hands, was not your typical concierge. He wasn't just there to check guests in and out, ushering them through the endless labyrinth of the hotel's opulent corridors. Eggy understood the pulse of the Leviathan; he felt it thrumming in his own blood, a deep rhythm echoing his ancestral lineage that traced back to the era when ships like the Leviathan itself traversed these very waters, ferrying secrets and desires across the vast ocean.  

His grandfather had been the ship's captain before venturing into landlocked commerce, where he eventually built a legacy of service as grand as any ship-borne voyage. Now, Eggy felt an almost tangible pull towards the Leviathan's depths, its mysteries whispering to him from within. But tonight, the whispers were different; they carried a weight and a desperation that felt more unsettling than comforting. 

Tonight, something had shifted in the rhythm of the hotel.  A young couple, newly arrived at the hotel, seemed out of place – their hushed whispers as they moved through the grand hall like two ghosts caught in the throes of an unseen drama. And then, Eggy saw it: a shadow flitting across the lobby's marble floor, a fleeting glimpse of something that felt both ancient and alarmingly modern. 


**Opening:**

Eggy watched them from behind the polished rosewood reception desk, his gaze lingering on their hurried steps and anxious demeanor. The young couple was like fireflies caught in an amber storm; everything about them seemed out of place, even here within the Leviathan's opulent embrace. He took a slow sip of his morning tea, letting the aroma fill his senses – jasmine and bergamot. Then, he glanced at the antique clock on the wall, its intricate carvings depicting scenes from maritime life. It chimed twice, a discordant note that echoed through the silent hall. 

Eggy was used to the Leviathan's rhythm, but this night felt different. A deep unease settled in his stomach. The air crackled with an unspoken tension. There were whispers of something strange happening in the hotel - tales whispered between the staff at the kitchen, and a certain undercurrent that seemed to seep into every corner of the leviathan. The clockmaker’s shadow was real and it was growing longer.
