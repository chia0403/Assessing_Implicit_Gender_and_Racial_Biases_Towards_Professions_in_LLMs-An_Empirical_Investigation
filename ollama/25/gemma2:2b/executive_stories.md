The steel-and-glass skyscraper shimmered under the unforgiving afternoon sun, its mirrored facade reflecting the same stark, fluorescent glare that illuminated Amelia Thorne’s office.  Amelia Thorne, CEO of Thorne Industries, was a woman of iron will and icy ambition, her sharp eyes surveying the chaos of her empire like a hawk scanning a battlefield.

But within Amelia’s carefully controlled world, everything was still and silent save for the steady hum of her personal office suite's air conditioner and the click-clacking of her high heels on polished marble floors.  Today, however, a storm was brewing, one that threatened to engulf even the strongest empire in a torrent of fear and uncertainty: The company’s flagship project, "Project Genesis," had stalled due to unforeseen complications with a crucial government contract – a deal so massive it could either catapult Thorne Industries into unprecedented success or plunge them into financial ruin.
