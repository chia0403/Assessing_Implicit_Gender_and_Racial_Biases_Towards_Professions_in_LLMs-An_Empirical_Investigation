The morning mist clung to the asphalt ribbons like an angry, damp cat’s fur, coating the highway in an unnerving gray haze that seemed to seep into every crevice of Cecil's soul. It was the kind of day that made you want to crawl under a rock and wait for the sun to burn its way through. He was out here on his shift as the sunrise finally broke over the horizon, painting the sky in streaks of orange and purple before turning them into bruised apples in a hurry. 

Cecil’s name echoed in the stillness of the empty construction site – a lone beacon in the vast expanse of gray steel and concrete that served as the highway's skeleton. His tool belt hung heavy against his worn jeans, and his hand-me-down work boots clicked rhythmically on the pavement as he inspected a section of guardrail. Each creak of the metal frame seemed to amplify the lonely silence – a soundtrack to his internal monologue: "Another day," he mumbled under his breath, wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his calloused hand. 


**Setting:** A deserted highway construction site in rural Nebraska. The atmosphere is quiet and oppressive, with the morning fog adding an element of mystery and foreboding.

**Main Character:** Cecil - a weathered and experienced highway worker who carries a quiet sense of melancholy in his everyday life.
