Rain hammered against the corrugated tin roof of "The Rusty Mug," its steady rhythm mirroring the persistent drumbeat in Ezra's chest.  A greasy sheen covered the worn counter where he stood, polishing glasses with a practiced hand while the air hung heavy with smoke and the faint aroma of whiskey. The place was more bar than establishment, a dive that drew in weary travelers like moths to a flickering lamp. His name, as etched on the dusty plaque above the door, was Ezra Thorne,  and for years he'd been the only constant in this sea of shifting faces and transient stories.

It was his job to tell them all, one drink at a time. To listen to their woes and weave a tapestry of words around them, a comforting blanket for the storms brewing within their souls.  But tonight, Ezra felt the storm rising in him too, an unsettling undertow pulling him towards something darker than usual.  A figure hunched in the corner, cloaked in shadows, his hat pulled low over his brow like a silent threat.   Something about the way he sat, his face masked behind the brim of his hat, sent a shiver down Ezra's spine. It wasn't just the heavy rain or the chill that seemed to seep from the very walls - something felt off, dangerous, and deeply unsettling.
