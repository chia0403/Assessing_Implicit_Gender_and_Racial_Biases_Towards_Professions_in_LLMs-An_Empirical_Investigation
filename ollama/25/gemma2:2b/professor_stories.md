## The Whispering Walls

**Setting:**  Professor Silas Blackwood's study, nestled within the labyrinthine halls of St. Augustine University, an imposing gothic edifice on the windswept coast of Ireland. Rain lashed against the arched windows, mirroring the turmoil brewing within the old professor’s mind. 

**Character:** Professor Silas Blackwood, a man weathered by years and marked by the passage of time.  His once fiery hair was now streaked with silver, his eyes a deep blue that held a lifetime of wisdom and sorrow. He was renowned for his expertise in ancient languages and folklore – an expert whose scholarly work had earned him not just respect, but also whispered rumors about hidden knowledge and a past shrouded in mystery.

**Opening:** 
The parchment crackled as Silas ran a callused finger across its surface, the words blurred by age and water damage.  His fingers trembled, echoing the rhythm of his unease. For months now, he’d been plagued with disturbing dreams – visions of shadowy figures dancing in abandoned libraries, of cryptic inscriptions on ancient tombs that seemed to hum with unseen energy. These dreams were no mere figments of sleep; they held a profound weight, a palpable sense of urgency.  Tonight, the words on the parchment felt different, charged with an unsettling force he couldn't explain. He was not just reading an old legend; he was stumbling upon something real, something potent enough to unravel his carefully constructed life. The walls of his study seemed to whisper secrets in the wind, urging him to decipher their meaning before it was too late. 


**What will happen next?**
* Will Silas solve the riddle on the parchment and understand its secrets?
* Is there an external threat that needs to be addressed?
* Does something more sinister lurk behind the whispers of his ancient texts?
