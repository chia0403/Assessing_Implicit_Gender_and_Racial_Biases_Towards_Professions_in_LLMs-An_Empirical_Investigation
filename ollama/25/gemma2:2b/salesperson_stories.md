Rain lashed against the windows of "Bargain Bazaar," obscuring the already dim light filtering through the gaudy floral wallpaper. Inside, Eleanor "Ellie" Davenport, known for her endless energy and even longer sales pitch, wiped down the dusty brass fixtures with an exasperated sigh. It was 3:00 PM on a Tuesday, and the afternoon had turned into a blur of uninterested customers and half-hearted compliments. The neon sign outside, promising "Deals So Good You'll Cry!" mocked Ellie's current predicament, its brilliance barely cutting through the rain-streaked glass.

Ellie, armed with her bright smile and even brighter imagination, was determined to turn this afternoon around.  She needed a sale, bad. And fast, before the clock struck five and closed shop for the night. The store's owner, a jovial man named Mr. Thompson with a penchant for paisley patterns and questionable business decisions, had left for his evening yoga session, leaving Ellie to navigate the treacherous waters of the "Bargain Bazaar" sales pit on her own.
