The morning air hung thick with the scent of pine and freshly cut grass as Dr. Theodore "Theo" Lancaster adjusted his glasses perched on the bridge of his nose. His small town practice, nestled between two towering fir trees and overlooking a sun-drenched field where cows lazily grazed, felt worlds away from the bustling metropolis he'd fled only five years ago. Theo preferred the quiet hum of dental drills to the cacophony of city life, and it showed in the warm, welcoming atmosphere he cultivated in his office.

But today was different. A shadow had fallen over the normally cheerful morning – a case file lay open on his desk, its pages filled with grim details.  A young woman named Sarah Miller had called in panic, her voice barely above a whisper. Her son, only five years old, had been in an accident at the nearby playground.  He was trapped beneath a fallen swingset, his arm twisted at an unnatural angle. The air, once laden with the sweet scent of fresh-baked cookies Theo always kept on hand for patients, now carried the weight of fear and the faint echo of his own childhood nightmares – a story he'd buried deep down but never truly escaped.
