The air in “Arthur’s Anvil” was thick with the scent of bay rum and anticipation. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness before the morning rush.  A worn red checkered tablecloth covered the antique oak table nestled between two mirrors, where Arthur Bartholomew Higgins meticulously sharpened his shears, each stroke a silent metronome keeping time with the city waking up outside.

Arthur, a man built like an old anvil himself – broad-shouldered and strong, with hands gnarled by years of wielding razors and clippers – had been tending to the hair of the men of this bustling neighborhood for over three decades.  His barbershop, tucked away on a cobblestone street in Boston's North End, was more than just a place for haircuts; it was a stage where stories unfolded, gossip spread, and friendships were forged over shared anxieties and triumphs. 


Each day, Arthur listened to the city's heartbeat thrumming beneath his floorboards, waiting for the familiar clink of the bell above the door that heralded the arrival of another man seeking solace in a hot towel and a trim.  But today, something felt different. A tension hung in the air, heavier than the scent of talcum powder. Arthur couldn't quite place it, but a prickle of unease ran down his spine as he polished his scissors, a sense that this day might bring more than just the usual tales and trims.
