The humid Georgia air hung heavy, thick with the scent of honeysuckle and impending rain. Cicadas buzzed their incessant rhythm, a counterpoint to the rumble of thunder echoing in the distance. 

Eleanor Blythe Prescott, her fiery red hair plastered to her forehead by sweat, adjusted the microphone clipped to her collar. She was on the outskirts of Willow Creek, a town notorious for its secrets and even more notorious for keeping them buried.  Ellie, as she preferred to be called, wasn't here for the charming Southern hospitality or the gossip swirling around the local diner. She was there for the story – the one that had begun with a whispered rumour and blossomed into a full-blown town conspiracy.

A lone dog barked in the distance, its mournful howl swallowed by the rising wind. The sky churned, bruised purple and grey, casting long shadows across the dusty road leading into Willow Creek. Ellie took a deep breath, the air thick with tension, and pushed on, her battered reporter’s notepad clutched tight in her hand.  This story was more than just another assignment; it was personal. It felt like digging beneath the skin of the town itself, unearthing truths that could unravel everything – or perhaps set it free.
