Atop a skyscraper that pierced the smoky sky, Amelia Celeste adjusted her microphone, its silver surface reflecting the cityâ€™s chaotic brilliance.

But beneath the shimmering facade of stardom, Amelia harbored a secret fear, a gnawing doubt that whispered she wasn't good enough. 


As the final chords of the opening act faded and the spotlight found her, Amelia took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and let the music take over. This was it. This was her moment to shine.
