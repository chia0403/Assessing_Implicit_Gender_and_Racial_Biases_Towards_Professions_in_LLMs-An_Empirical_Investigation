The aroma of burnt coffee hung heavy in the air, mingling with the sweet scent of cinnamon rolls cooling on the counter. Amelia Beaumont, certified nutritionist and self-proclaimed culinary alchemist, winced at the smell of her own morning catastrophe. She’d left the coffee pot unattended while she frantically prepped for a full day of client consultations, a symphony of smoothie ingredients, protein shakes, and kale salads swirling in her mind.  

Amelia's office was tucked away on a cobblestone street in a historic district of Charleston, South Carolina. Its pastel-colored walls were adorned with botanical prints, and the windows overflowed with vibrant succulents. The space felt more like a cozy tea room than a clinical setting, reflecting Amelia’s belief that nourishing your body started with nurturing your soul. But today, even the warmth of the afternoon sun filtering through the stained glass couldn't quite melt away the stress brewing in her stomach.
