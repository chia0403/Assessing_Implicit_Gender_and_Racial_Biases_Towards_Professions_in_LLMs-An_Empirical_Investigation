The mist clung to the valley like a shroud, swallowing the morning sun in its ethereal embrace. Dewdrops glistened on spiderwebs strung between the gnarled branches of ancient oaks, each one sparkling like a miniature diamond. 

Eleanor Wrenwood, her weathered face creased with a thousand smiles and frown lines, pushed open the heavy wooden door to the stable. The familiar scent of hay, manure, and horses hit her like a warm wave.  She ran a gloved hand over the sleek coat of a chestnut mare named Willow, murmuring soft reassurances as she finished tacking up the saddle. 

Today was different. Eleanor could feel it in her bones. A sense of unease prickled at the edges of her mind, whispering warnings about an impending storm, not just the weather kind, but something deeper, more insidious. Yet, despite the unsettling premonition, Eleanor pressed on, determined to fulfill her duty as caretaker of Oakhaven Sanctuary, a refuge for injured and abandoned animals nestled deep in the heart of the sprawling, mist-shrouded valley.
