The sawdust clung to Elias Thorne’s beard like winter snow clinging to pine boughs. The scent of cedar filled his small workshop, a comforting aroma that always calmed the frayed edges of his nerves. Outside, the wind howled across the desolate moorlands, rattling the loose panes in his windows. It was a wild November day on the craggy Yorkshire coast, the kind that sent shivers down your spine and made you want to huddle by a roaring fire with a mug of something strong.

Elias, however, found solace in the rhythmic thrum of his plane against wood. His calloused fingers moved with practiced ease, shaping a piece of oak into the graceful curve of a ship’s rudder. It was a commission for Captain Amelia Croft, a woman as fearless and determined as the storms that battered her vessel on the open sea. Elias respected her spirit, even if he preferred the solid ground beneath his feet. 


The workshop, nestled at the edge of a sleepy village called Havenwood, was Elias’ sanctuary. He had built it himself after inheriting his grandfather’s tools and the legacy of their family trade. The weathered stone walls, patched with mortar over the years, whispered tales of generations past, each groove and crack a testament to time and hard work. A worn workbench sat at the heart of the space, surrounded by shelves stacked with tools of every imaginable shape and size - each one an extension of Elias himself.
