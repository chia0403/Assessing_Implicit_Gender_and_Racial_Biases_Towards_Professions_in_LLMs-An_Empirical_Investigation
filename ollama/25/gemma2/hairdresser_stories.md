The bell above the door to "Shear Delight" jingled with the familiar chime of another Tuesday afternoon. Elara Juniper sighed, adjusting the fuchsia headband perched precariously on her messy bun. Another day, another parade of bad haircuts and desperate pleas for “just a trim.”  

Elara surveyed her salon: walls painted the color of faded cotton candy, mirrored panels reflecting the fluorescent hum above, and the faint scent of hairspray mingling with cheap coffee. It wasn't exactly glamorous, but it was hers. She’d poured her heart and soul into this little haven on Elm Street, a beacon of hope for anyone whose mane had succumbed to its own whims. Today, though, hope felt as thin as Elara's patience. 


The first customer through the door wasn't bringing much cheer. A middle-aged man with a receding hairline and an equally receding mood stomped in, his face contorted into a grimace that could curdle milk. "I need a miracle," he grumbled, dropping his worn leather wallet on the counter. "My wife said she wouldn't speak to me until I got this mess fixed." 

Elara suppressed a smile. She knew exactly what "mess" meant. It was going to be a long afternoon.
