The scent of antiseptic clung to Dr. Amelia Thistlewick's white coat like a second skin. The sterile air of her small dental practice hummed with the quiet whirring of tools and the low murmur of the water fountain in the corner. Sunlight filtered through the gauzy curtains, casting long, pale rectangles across the worn linoleum floor. Outside, the bustling market square of Cobblestone Lane was alive with the cacophony of hawkers and chattering townsfolk, but within the walls of her practice, Amelia found a peculiar tranquility. She preferred the predictable rhythm of drills and prodding, the neat order of teeth files and suction tubes, to the messy chaos of life beyond. 


Amelia paused, adjusting the surgical mask that concealed half her face. The waiting room was empty for once, a welcome reprieve from the usual tide of anxious patients. She glanced at the clock - precisely 10:47 am - and sighed.  Today, however, was different. Today, she was expecting a patient unlike any other. A man named Silas Blackwood, shrouded in whispers and rumors, had requested an appointment. His reason? He claimed to have a tooth that pulsed with an unnatural light. Amelia, ever the pragmatist, dismissed it as fanciful nonsense. Yet, a sliver of curiosity pricked at her, something she hadn't felt in years. This was Cobblestone Lane after all; a place where reality often blurred with the fantastical.
