The Nevada sun beat down on Elias "Big Eli" Montgomery's weathered neck like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes as he wrestled with the stubborn tarp covering his load â€“ a shipment of fragile glassware destined for Las Vegas. The air shimmered above the dusty asphalt, distorting the horizon and blurring the edges of the endless sagebrush plains. His Peterbilt 379, affectionately nicknamed "Betsy," rumbled beneath him, its engine sighing like an old man after a hard day's work. Eli squinted at the road ahead, his calloused hand gripping the steering wheel. The highway stretched before him, a ribbon of black against the blinding white canvas of the desert, leading him deeper into the heart of nowhere.  


He was running late, again.
