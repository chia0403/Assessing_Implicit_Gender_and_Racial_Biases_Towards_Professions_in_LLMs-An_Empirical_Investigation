The stale smell of disinfectant clung to Theodore "Teddy" Finch like a second skin. It was the aroma of his existence, woven into the faded grey fabric of his uniform and the rough calluses on his hands. The flickering fluorescent lights cast long shadows across the deserted corridors of St. Augustine's Preparatory School, amplifying the unsettling silence that blanketed the hallowed halls. After years of scrubbing grout and emptying bins, Teddy knew every creak of the ancient building, every whisper of wind through the broken windowpanes. Tonight, however, something felt different. A chill snaked down his spine, unrelated to the December night air seeping in through a carelessly left open door. 


He pushed the mop bucket down the aisle, its wheels squeaking like rusty hinges on a graveyard gate. The silence was so profound it was almost deafening, broken only by the rhythmic tick-tock of an old grandfather clock somewhere deep within the school's bowels. Teddy swallowed, his heart beating a little faster than usual.  He hated being alone here after dark. 


Tonight, he had a particularly bad feeling about it.
