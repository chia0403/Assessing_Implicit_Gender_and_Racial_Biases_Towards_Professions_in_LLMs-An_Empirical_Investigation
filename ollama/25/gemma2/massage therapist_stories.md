The scent of eucalyptus hung heavy in the air, a comforting fog around Amelia Celeste Rose's tiny massage studio nestled on a side street in Portland. Rain lashed against the large storefront window, blurring the neon sign that read "Serenity Now" into an impressionistic watercolour. Inside, the world was warm and hushed, illuminated by the soft glow of candles and fairy lights strung across exposed brick walls. 

Amelia kneaded doughy shoulder muscles with practiced hands, her own body a well-oiled machine honed from years of physical work. Her clients, often burdened with stress and tightness they'd been carrying for weeks, months even, left feeling lighter, more fluid. But Amelia felt a different kind of weight settling in her chest - a gnawing unease that had nothing to do with lactic acid build-up or knotted tendons. It was a feeling she couldn't quite place, a premonition of something coming, something big.
