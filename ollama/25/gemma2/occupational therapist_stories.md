The aroma of antiseptic and faintly burnt toast hung heavy in the air as Amelia Rose Harper adjusted her stethoscope.  She surveyed the sterile expanse of Patient Rehab 3, its walls decorated with bland motivational posters that seemed to mock the weary faces of the recovering patients. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the silence punctuated only by the rhythmic whirring of a nearby ventilator. Amelia sighed. It wasn't exactly the sun-drenched beach sheâ€™d envisioned for her Tuesday morning.

She was supposed to be working with Mr. Samuelson, an elderly gentleman who suffered a stroke last month. But his therapy had been cancelled due to a sudden outbreak of influenza sweeping through the facility, leaving Amelia with an abundance of free time and a growing sense of restlessness. 


Amelia straightened her lilac scrubs and tapped her foot impatiently, waiting for her next assignment. Outside, the bustling city hummed with life, a stark contrast to the hushed stillness within these walls. She longed to be out there, amidst the vibrant chaos, helping people reclaim their independence in the real world, not just this sterile haven.
