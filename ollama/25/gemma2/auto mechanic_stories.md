The greasy tang of motor oil hung in the air like a thick fog, clinging to Amelia “Amy” Grace’s overalls and hair. Her knuckles were scraped raw from wrestling with a stubborn bolt on Mr. Henderson’s rusty Ford pickup, and her forehead was slick with sweat. She wiped it away with the back of her hand, leaving a streak of grime across her cheek.

The setting sun cast long shadows across the cluttered workshop of “Amy’s Auto Angels,” casting everything in a warm, orange glow. Tools lay scattered like fallen soldiers on workbench scarred by years of use. A half-disassembled engine sat perched precariously on an old tire rack, its chrome parts glinting menacingly in the fading light.  A faded calendar hung crookedly on the wall, sporting a picture of a grinning mechanic holding up a gleaming prize-winning car – a far cry from Amy’s current project. 


Mr. Henderson, his face creased with worry, shuffled back and forth nervously in front of his truck. He'd been driving it for over thirty years, its every rattle and groan a familiar comfort. Now, facing an engine rebuild at the twilight of its life, he felt a pang of loss that mirrored Amy’s own struggle to keep her father's legacy alive.
