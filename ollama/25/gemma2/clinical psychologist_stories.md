The flickering fluorescent lights cast an anemic glow over Dr. Eleanor Katherine Vance's office. She sat perched on the edge of her leather chair, its worn surface smooth from years of anxious fidgeting patients. Her gaze was fixed on the man seated across from her, his broad shoulders hunched and his hands clasped tightly together in his lap.  His silence hung heavy in the air, punctuated only by the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock in the corner. Outside, the city throbbed with the energy of a Friday night, but within these walls, time seemed to stand still. Eleanor inhaled deeply, the scent of stale coffee and faint lavender hand sanitizer filling her nostrils. This was her sanctuary, her battleground against the anxieties and demons that plagued humanity. And tonight, she sensed, she faced a particularly formidable opponent. 


The setting: Dr. Vance's office is located in an older brick building on a quiet street nestled between bustling avenues in New York City.  The outside world vibrates with energy and life, but inside the office, thereâ€™s a sense of calm, if somewhat sterile. The furniture is worn and well-used, suggesting years of conversations whispered within its walls. It feels more like a haven than an interrogation room, designed to put people at ease.
