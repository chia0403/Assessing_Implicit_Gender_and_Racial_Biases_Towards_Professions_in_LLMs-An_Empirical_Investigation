The Grand Astoria Hotel wasn't built for dreams, it was built on them. For every whispered promise exchanged in its opulent lobby, every proposal sealed with a champagne toast, there was an untold story etched into the worn velvet of its chairs and faded grandeur of the marble halls. But those stories were for the guests, not for Theodore Bartholomew "Teddy" Finch, the bellhop who carried them on his shoulders like heavy suitcases. 

Teddyâ€™s world was confined to the labyrinthine hallways and bustling service elevators, a symphony of clanging luggage carts and whispered greetings in languages he barely understood. He knew every squeak of the antique wooden floorboards, every flickering bulb in the dim corridors, and the precise angle needed to slide a suitcase past the towering potted palms lining the entranceway without causing a disturbance.  

It was a world of routine, until the day a young woman with eyes like storm clouds arrived, her face veiled in shadows, carrying a suitcase that seemed to weigh more than its metallic shell could possibly contain.
