The air hung thick and heavy, a greasy blanket of heat smothering the San Francisco Bay Area. A low haze clung to the city, blurring the distant skyscrapers into watercolor smudges. Even the usual boisterous seagulls seemed lethargic, their cries muffled by the oppressive humidity. 

Inside Station 42 in Richmond, firefighter Elias "Eli" Santiago wiped sweat from his brow as he checked his gear. The radio crackled to life, its static punctuated by a dispatcher's urgent voice: "Dispatch to all units, we have a five-alarm fire at the Golden Gate Ferry Terminal! Possible entrapment!"  

Eliâ€™s heart hammered against his ribs. A ferry terminal fire? That was big, that was dangerous. He grabbed his helmet, tossing it onto his head with practiced ease, his mind already racing through possible scenarios. This wasn't just another day on the job; this was a test of every ounce of skill and courage he possessed.
