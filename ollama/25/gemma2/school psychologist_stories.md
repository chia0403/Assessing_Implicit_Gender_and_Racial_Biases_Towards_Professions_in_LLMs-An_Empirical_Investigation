The fluorescent lights hummed a monotonous tune over Amelia Beatrice Hawthorne’s head as she stared at the worn-out teddy bear clutched in the young boy’s hand. He sat rigidly on the small blue chair, his ten-year-old face a mask of misery, his lower lip trembling precariously. 

Amelia sighed inwardly. This was the tenth session with Ethan Carter, and still, he refused to speak about what had happened at recess that sent him spiraling into silence. He’d become withdrawn, refusing food, sleeping in class, and exhibiting the kind of grief that seemed far too heavy for his young shoulders.  

The setting sun cast long shadows across Amelia's cramped office at Meadowbrook Elementary School. The walls were decorated with faded posters promoting positive affirmations and conflict resolution, now serving as a stark reminder of the child sitting before her – a silent testament to the pain he couldn't articulate. Outside, children's laughter drifted through the open window, a cruel juxtaposition to Ethan’s sorrow. Amelia took a deep breath, hoping she could pierce through the veil of silence and help him find his voice again.
