The morning sun beat down on Beatrice "Bea" Callahan's neck as she climbed out of her cab. The air hung thick with dust kicked up by the earthmover sheâ€™d been wrestling for the past four hours. She squinted at the horizon where the Arizona desert stretched, a tapestry of ochre and burnt sienna under a sky the color of a bruised peach. Bea adjusted the bandana tied around her forehead, catching a few beads of sweat trickling down her temple. 

This stretch of Route 66 was dying a slow death, bypassed by newer highways long ago. The once-bustling main street was now a graveyard of boarded-up shops and rusty neon signs flickering weakly in the wind. But Bea found solace in this desolate beauty. Out here, there was only the hum of machinery, the screech of gravel under her tires, and the whisper of the wind through the scrub brush. Here, she could lose herself in the rhythm of work, forgetting the ghosts that haunted her city life back in Phoenix.
