The humid air hung heavy in the Kuala Lumpur airport, thick with the scent of curry and jet fuel.  Seraphina Amelia Vance, her blonde hair pulled back in a neat bun, smoothed down her crisp maroon uniform as she waited for passengers to board Flight 873 to Bangkok. Seraphina was a veteran flight attendant, known for her calm demeanor and impeccable service. She had seen it all â€“ tantrums from toddlers, lost luggage, even the occasional mid-air proposal. But today, something felt different. A prickling sensation ran down her spine, a sense of unease that she couldn't shake. As the passengers filed onto the plane, Seraphina noticed a man seated in the first row, his face shrouded in shadow by a wide-brimmed hat. His eyes, dark and intense, seemed to bore into hers as he passed by. 

She tried to dismiss it as her imagination, but the feeling of foreboding intensified. The sun was setting over the city, painting the sky in vibrant hues of orange and purple, but Seraphina couldn't find a single ray of beauty in the spectacle.  As she made her way through the aisles, checking tickets and offering refreshments, her gaze kept drifting back to the mysterious man. This flight, she sensed, was going to be anything but ordinary.
