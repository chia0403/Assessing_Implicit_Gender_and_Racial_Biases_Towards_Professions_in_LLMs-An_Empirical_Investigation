The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and regret in Mercy General's Intensive Care Unit. Amelia "Amy" Rose Thornton, her name tag pinned to her navy scrubs, adjusted her thick-rimmed glasses and sighed, the weight of the shift already pressing down on her shoulders. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sterile glow on the rows of patients tethered to machines, their chests rising and falling in shallow breaths.  

A persistent beeping emanated from one corner, drawing Amy's gaze towards the source - a young man, barely out of his teens, connected to an array of monitors. His face was pale, etched with worry lines that seemed too deep for someone so young. He had been admitted after a motorcycle accident, his parents clinging to hope at his bedside. But beneath the rhythmic beeping, Amy felt a sense of unease, a whisper of impending darkness she couldn't quite place. 


This wasn't just another shift.  It felt different, charged with an almost palpable tension. A storm was brewing within these walls, and Amy, as always, found herself caught in its path.
