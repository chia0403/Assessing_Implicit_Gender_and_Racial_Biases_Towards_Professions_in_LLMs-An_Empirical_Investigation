Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Jasper Thorne's office, blurring the neon glow of the 'Open 24/7' sign hanging precariously above the door. The air inside was thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, two aromas that had become intimately familiar to Thorne over his years in the unforgiving world of private investigation.

Jasper "Jack" Thorne wasn't your typical gumshoe. He lacked the slick suits and fedora-wearing charm usually associated with the profession. Instead, he favored worn leather jackets, faded denim, and a perpetual five o'clock shadow that seemed to have taken root on his rugged face. A tremor in his right hand, a consequence of an old bullet wound sustained during a botched case years ago, betrayed his weary soul.  

The flickering neon light cast long shadows across the cluttered desk where Thorne sat hunched over a file labeled "Case 37: Missing Person - Clara Bennett." He rubbed his temples, trying to banish the headache that seemed as persistent as the rain outside. This wasn't just another missing person case; there was something about Clara Bennett's disappearance that gnawed at him, a feeling he couldn't quite place.

The phone on his desk rang, jolting him from his thoughts. He snatched it up with a sigh, bracing himself for whatever trouble awaited on the other end.


"Thorne Investigations," he rasped into the receiver. "What is it you need?"
