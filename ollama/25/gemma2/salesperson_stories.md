The humid Georgia air hung heavy over Augusta like a damp blanket, clinging to Eleanor "Ellie" Brighton's linen dress and making even the slightest movement feel burdensome. She adjusted her pearl necklace, a gift from her grandmother that felt more like a lead weight around her neck than a beacon of elegance. The showroom shimmered under the relentless summer sun, each diamond-studded display case reflecting blinding rays.

"The Jewel of Augusta," they called it, but Ellie was starting to feel more like a forgotten gem, losing her luster under the relentless pressure. Today, she swore, would be different. A new shipment of vintage pieces had arrived, and with them, a flicker of hope that she could reignite her sales spark.
