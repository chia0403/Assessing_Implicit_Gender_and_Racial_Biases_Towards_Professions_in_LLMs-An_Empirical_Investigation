The biting wind whipped across the plains of Aethelred, carrying with it the scent of frost and distant smoke. Elias Thorne, his breath misting in the frigid air, scanned the horizon for any sign of movement. His gaze swept over the endless tapestry of brown and grey – withered grass, barren scrub, and the occasional solitary oak clinging stubbornly to life.  The crumbling watchtower, perched precariously on a wind-battered crag, offered little protection from the elements. Elias pulled his fur cloak tighter, its worn leather creaking with every shift. This was his post – Grimstone Watch – a lonely sentinel at the edge of civilization. 

Elias wasn't a man who craved company. He found solace in the quiet rhythm of duty: patrolling the perimeter, meticulously logging weather patterns, and sharpening his sword until it gleamed like a sliver of moonlight. But lately, a gnawing unease had taken root in his heart. The whispers from the south – stories of raiders, creatures of shadow, and a darkness spreading across the land – had begun to feel less like tales and more like threats on the horizon. Tonight, as the sun dipped below the jagged peaks and cast long, menacing shadows across the plains, Elias felt an inexplicable prickling on his skin. Something was coming.
