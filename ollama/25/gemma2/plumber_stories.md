The humid Atlanta air hung thick as molasses in August, clinging to Elias "Eli" Thompson like a second skin. Sweat beaded on his forehead, stinging his eyes as he wrestled with the stubborn drainpipe under Mrs. Henderson's bathroom sink. The porcelain basin was already half-full of murky water, smelling faintly of mildew and regret. 

Mrs. Henderson, a woman whose silver hair seemed perpetually ruffled by an invisible wind, watched from her perch on the toilet seat, clutching a fluffy pink towel. "I told you it was backed up again, Elias," she said in a voice that could curdle milk, "This sink is cursed! It's like plumbing for Poseidon himself."

Eli grunted, his biceps straining against the rusted pipe. He hadn't believed Mrs. Henderson's superstitious ramblings at first, but now, after three hours of battling this drain, he wasn't so sure. Maybe Atlanta was just built on a foundation of bad plumbing karma.
