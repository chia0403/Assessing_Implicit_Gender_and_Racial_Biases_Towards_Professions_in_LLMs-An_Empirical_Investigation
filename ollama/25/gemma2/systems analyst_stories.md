The flickering fluorescent lights cast long, skeletal shadows across Amelia Beatrice Croft’s workspace. A thin layer of dust motes danced in the beam, disturbed only by the rhythmic tap-tap-tap of her fingers against the worn keys of her keyboard. Around her, the vast server room hummed with a low, guttural drone – a symphony of cooling fans and whirring hard drives that Amelia had come to find strangely comforting. 

Amelia, a systems analyst for the sprawling tech conglomerate known as Nova Corp, was alone. It was 3:47 am, well past when the rest of the company had vanished into their suburban homes, leaving her with the ghosts of yesterday's data and the looming shadows of tomorrow's deadlines. Tonight, though, she wasn’t wrestling with code or troubleshooting network issues. Tonight, something else had drawn her back to this dimly lit sanctuary: a cryptic email from an unknown sender, promising answers to a question Amelia hadn't even dared to ask herself.
