The static crackled like an angry viper, spitting curses at Amelia Juniper Bellwether's every attempt to soothe it. Outside her rickety workshop in Dustbowl Gulch, the wind howled like a banshee, whipping sand against the corrugated iron walls and whistling through the gaps in the windowpanes. The rusty sign outside, barely clinging to its hinges, proclaimed "Bellwether's Broadcast Barn" with faded pride. 

Amelia, a woman whose weathered face mirrored the rugged landscape she called home, wrestled with the tangled wires of an ancient radio receiver. Her calloused fingers, stained with grease and solder, worked with practiced precision, her brow furrowed in concentration. The silence that followed each adjustment was pregnant with anticipation, shattered only by the howling wind and Amelia's muttered curses. 

Tonight, a storm wasn't just brewing outside; it raged within Amelia herself.  A message had come through on the static-laced airwaves â€“ a faint, frantic plea for help from an unknown source. A desperate call echoing across the desolate wasteland that Dustbowl Gulch had become. This wasn't just another repair job. This was something more. Something dangerous. And Amelia, despite her better judgement, couldn't resist the pull of the unknown.
