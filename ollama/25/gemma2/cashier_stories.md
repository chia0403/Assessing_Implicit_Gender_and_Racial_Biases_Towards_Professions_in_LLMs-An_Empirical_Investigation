The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia "Amy" Harper's head, casting a sterile glow over the aisles of discount toiletries and dusty housewares. The air was thick with the scent of stale bleach and artificial lavender, a fragrance unique to every grocery store in America.  It was Tuesday afternoon, 2:37 pm to be precise â€“ just long enough into the shift for Amy's eyelids to feel heavy and her fingers to ache from scanning endless barcodes. 

The bell above the door jingled, momentarily breaking the monotony of the afternoon. A lone customer shuffled in, a crumpled paper bag clutched in his hand. He looked like he hadn't slept in days, his eyes shadowed and sunken. Amy gave him a tired smile, her practiced cashier greeting barely audible over the whirring of the cash register. 


"Hello there, sir," she chirped. "How are you today?"
