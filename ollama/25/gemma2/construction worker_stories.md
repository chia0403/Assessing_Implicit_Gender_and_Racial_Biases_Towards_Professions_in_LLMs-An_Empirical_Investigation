The sunrise hammered against Elias Thorne's eyelids, dragging him from his restless sleep. It wasn't the harsh light itself that bothered him, but the echoing clang of metal on metal that seemed to accompany it every morning. He sat up in his bunk, the thin mattress sighing beneath him, and peered out the grime-streaked window of the construction site trailer. 

The air was already thick with the smell of dust and diesel. Down below, a symphony of clanging hammers and roaring engines played out against the backdrop of the city's awakening. The steel skeleton of what would one day be the "Skyline Tower" pierced the morning sky, a monument to ambition and progress – or at least that’s what the brochure had said. Elias wasn’t sure about any of it.  

He swung his legs out of bed, his boots landing with a familiar thud on the cracked linoleum floor. Another day, another dollar. He pulled on his dusty work overalls and headed for the communal shower stall, where he joined the other weary construction workers in their ritualistic cleansing before facing the chaos that awaited them.  


The setting is a bustling urban construction site in the early morning hours, rife with noise, dust, and the smell of industry.
