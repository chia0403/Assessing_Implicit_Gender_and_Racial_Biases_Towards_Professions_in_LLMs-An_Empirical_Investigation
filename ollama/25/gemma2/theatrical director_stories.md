The velvet curtains felt rough against Elara Beaumont’s fingertips, like sandpaper on her anxieties.  They were usually smooth, yielding to her touch with a quiet promise of hushed whispers and rapt attention from the audience. Not tonight. Tonight, they felt like a barrier, separating her from the chaotic storm brewing backstage. 

The air hung thick with the scent of dust and desperation. A lone spotlight pierced the gloom, illuminating a rehearsal space that resembled a battlefield more than a haven for creativity. Props were scattered haphazardly – a half-painted birdcage, a crumpled crown, a forgotten sword dripping with crimson paint. Actors paced restlessly, their lines tangled like the knotted ropes strung across the ceiling. 

Elara took a deep breath, her usual theatrical flair replaced by a weary frown. She adjusted the thick spectacles perched on her nose, squinting at the script clutched in her hand. Tonight was opening night for "The Phoenix Requiem," a production she'd poured her heart and soul into. It was supposed to be her triumphant return after years of self-imposed exile, but the mounting chaos threatened to turn it into a spectacular disaster. 


The setting: A crumbling, once-grand theatre on the outskirts of a forgotten city. The air is thick with dust, the scent of old wood and faded grandeur hangs heavy. The stage itself is in disrepair, with chipped paint and creaky floorboards.
