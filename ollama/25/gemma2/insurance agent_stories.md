The humid Florida air clung to Amelia Beatrice "Millie" Kensington like a damp towel. Her straw hat did little to shield her from the relentless August sun as she stood on Mrs. Higgins' porch, clipboard in hand.  Palm trees swayed rhythmically in the breeze, their fronds rustling like whispered secrets. The scent of salt and sunscreen hung heavy in the air, punctuated by the distant cries of gulls circling overhead. 

Mrs. Higgins, a woman whose age was as indeterminate as her fondness for floral print dresses, shuffled to the porch swing, her arthritic knees protesting with every step. Millie plastered on her most reassuring smile. It wasn't easy maintaining professional cheer when you were facing a claim involving a very disgruntled iguana and a rather unfortunate case of accidental poolside defecation.  


"Now Mrs. Higgins," Millie began, tapping her pen against the clipboard, "I understand your concerns about Mr. Scales'...unfortunate incident."
