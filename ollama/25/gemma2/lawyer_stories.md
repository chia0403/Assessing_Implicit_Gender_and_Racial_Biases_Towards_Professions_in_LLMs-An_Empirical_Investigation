Outside, the city lights blurred into hazy streaks, their vibrant glow swallowed by the storm’s angry grey. Inside, the only illumination came from the harsh glare of her desk lamp, casting long, distorted shadows on the meticulously organized piles of case files scattered across her surface.

The weight of responsibility pressed down on her like a physical burden – the fate of countless livelihoods hung precariously in the balance.
