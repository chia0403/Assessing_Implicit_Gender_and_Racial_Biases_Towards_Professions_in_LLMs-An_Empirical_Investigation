The humid Georgia air clung to Elias “Eli” Davenport like a second skin as he wrestled the frayed wiring from its rusted prison. The old farmhouse creaked around him, each groan of wood a testament to years spent weathering relentless sun and torrential rains. Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing through a grimy windowpane, illuminating Eli’s calloused hands working deftly with pliers and wire strippers. 

He wasn't used to this kind of work - more high-end condos than creaky farmhouses usually filled his schedule. But when his aunt Maggie called, needing help fixing the aging wiring that threatened to electrocute any unsuspecting soul daring to flick a light switch, Eli couldn’t say no. After all, the farmhouse held a lifetime of memories for him – summers spent chasing fireflies in the dusk-painted fields and evenings huddled around the crackling fireplace listening to his Aunt Maggie spin tales of family history.

He sighed, tightening the last connection with a satisfying click. "Just like old times," he murmured, wiping sweat from his brow. He glanced at the dusty portraits lining the walls, each one staring back with knowing eyes – faces etched with time and stories untold. The farmhouse was more than just an old building; it was a living history book, and Eli felt a responsibility to keep its heart beating. 


But as he flipped the switch, plunging the room into light, a flicker of unease danced in his gut. Something wasn’t right. He could almost feel a prickling sensation on the back of his neck, like unseen eyes watching him from the shadows. Maybe it was just the old house settling, or the weight of generations past bearing down on him. Whatever it was, Eli knew he was in for more than just a routine electrical repair. This farmhouse held secrets, and they were starting to reveal themselves.
