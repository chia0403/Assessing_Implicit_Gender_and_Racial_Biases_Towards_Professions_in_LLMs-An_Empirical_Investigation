The air hung thick with the smell of chalk dust and stale coffee in the cramped workshop. Sunlight slanted through grimy windows, illuminating motes dancing in the stillness like tiny, forgotten stars. Elara Thorne, her forehead creased with concentration, meticulously traced lines on a blueprint spread across her workbench. Her calloused fingers, stained with graphite and ink, moved with practiced precision, each stroke guided by years of experience as a draftswoman for the esteemed House Alaric.

She visualized towering cathedrals that pierced the sky, intricate clockworks that hummed with hidden energy, and fantastical contraptions that defied gravity. Her designs were sought after by nobles and merchants alike, her name whispered in awe within the hallowed halls of Alaric's grand mansion. Yet, despite her talent and the prestige it brought, Elara found herself yearning for something more. She dreamt of a world beyond blueprints, a world where her creations weren't confined to paper but sprang to life under the open sky.
