The sun hadn't yet crested the horizon, painting the sky with soft hues of apricot and lavender, when Elara Thistlewood pulled on her worn leather boots. The air was crisp, carrying the scent of damp earth and dew-kissed clover. Roosters crowed in the distance, a counterpoint to the gentle chirping of sparrows nestled in the apple orchard behind her farmhouse. 

Elara's hands, roughened by years of toil, traced the familiar lines of her weathered face as she glanced at the reflection in the dusty window pane. Forty-two seasons had passed since she'd first walked these fields, forty-two seasons of coaxing life from the stubborn soil. Now, with the harvest on the horizon and a gnawing unease settling in her gut, Elara Thistlewood knew that this year would be different. Something was changing, something beyond the predictable rhythm of the seasons, something that whispered of both opportunity and peril on the wind. 


The story takes place in rural Yorkshire, England, a few years before the outbreak of World War I. The landscape is rolling hills dotted with quaint villages and vast fields ripe for harvest.
