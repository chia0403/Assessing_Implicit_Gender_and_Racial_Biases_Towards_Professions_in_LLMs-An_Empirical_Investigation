The air hung thick with the scent of sizzling garlic and stale beer, clinging to Elara Mae Bellweather like a second skin. She weaved through the crowded tables of "The Rusty Mug," her red boots tapping a staccato rhythm against the sticky linoleum floor. The din was a symphony of clinking glasses, raucous laughter, and the murmur of conversations punctuated by the occasional bellow from the kitchen.  

Elara Mae took a deep breath, bracing herself for another Friday night at The Rusty Mug - a dive bar nestled on the edge of town, where regulars came for cheap drinks and questionable karaoke, and servers like her came to make ends meet. Tonight, however, felt different. A strange energy buzzed beneath the usual chaotic hum, a prickle that danced across Elara Mae's skin. She couldn't quite place it, but something told her this night wouldn't be just another Friday.
