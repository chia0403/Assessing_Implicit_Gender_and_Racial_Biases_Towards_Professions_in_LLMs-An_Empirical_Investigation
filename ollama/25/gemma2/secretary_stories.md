The air in Mrs. Periwinkle's office felt as brittle as the antique lace adorning her desk.  Sunlight slanted through the stained-glass window, casting Eleanor Pearl Thistlewick in a kaleidoscope of fractured colours. It was an effect she usually found charming, but today, it only served to highlight the dust motes dancing in the stagnant air. 

Eleanor sighed, adjusting the thick spectacles perched precariously on her nose. A stack of unfiled letters rose like a menacing monument beside her â€“ each one a silent testament to Mrs. Periwinkle's utter disorganisation and Eleanor's growing frustration. Outside, London hummed with the energy of a city on the cusp of change; but within these four walls, time seemed to have stopped altogether. The year was 1928, and for Eleanor, life was a tedious loop of answering telephones, managing appointments, and suppressing the urge to re-arrange the clutter that threatened to engulf them both.
