The air smelled faintly of lavender shampoo and cheap cologne â€“ a scent Amy had come to associate with both comfort and fleeting moments of human connection. Outside, the late August sun beat down on the faded awning, casting long, lazy shadows across the cracked sidewalk. Inside, Amy worked her magic, transforming unruly mop-tops into neat bobs and buzzcuts, all while dispensing witty advice and friendly banter.  She wasn't just a hair cutter; she was a confidante, a therapist, and sometimes even a cheerleader to the regulars who filled her shop with their daily woes and triumphs. Today, though, something felt different. An unsettling tension hung in the air, heavier than the humidity clinging to the back of Amy's neck. The usual bustle seemed muted, replaced by a nervous quiet that prickled at the edges of her senses.
