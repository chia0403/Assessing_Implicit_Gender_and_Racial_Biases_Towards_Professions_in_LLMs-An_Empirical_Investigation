The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Thornton's head like a swarm of disgruntled bees. She sighed, pushing aside a stray strand of auburn hair that had escaped her bun. The air in her cramped office at Northwood High was thick with the scent of stale coffee and teenage angst. 

Amelia stared out the window at the bustling courtyard. A gaggle of giggling girls huddled near the fountain, their whispered secrets swirling like dandelion seeds on a breezy day. A lanky boy with headphones perched precariously on his head slammed into a locker, his face flushed with frustration. These were her charges, these confused and desperate souls seeking her counsel in the labyrinthine hallways of adolescence.  

She knew every freckle and furrow on their faces, every whispered worry and silent rebellion. They sought her out when their lives felt like tangled skeins of yarn, hoping she could untangle them, thread by delicate thread. But Amelia was beginning to wonder if she was just another frayed end, desperate for someone to tie her loose ends together. 


The afternoon bell rang, its shrill cry echoing through the halls. A shadow fell across Amelia's doorway. It was Sarah Jenkins, a bright-eyed sophomore who had been battling anxiety since last semester.  

“Ms. Thornton?” Sarah's voice was barely a whisper. “I need to talk about college applications.”
