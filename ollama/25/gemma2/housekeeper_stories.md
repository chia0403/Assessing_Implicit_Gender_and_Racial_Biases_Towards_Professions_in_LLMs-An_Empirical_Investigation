The scent of lavender polish clung to Amelia Katherine Davenport's cotton dress like a second skin. It was her favorite scent – calming, familiar, comforting in the face of the endless parade of grime she tackled daily. Amelia, or Amy as most people called her, meticulously polished the brass doorknob on the back entrance of Blackwood Manor.  The manor itself loomed over the sleepy seaside town of Havenwood, a hulking Victorian mansion draped in ivy and shrouded in whispers. The locals claimed it was haunted, cursed even, its inhabitants long gone, leaving behind an echo of forgotten grandeur and unanswered questions. Amy didn't believe in ghosts, but she couldn't deny the chill that snaked down her spine as she entered the shadowed halls each morning.


She’d been working at Blackwood Manor for five years now, ever since Mrs. Eleanor Blackwood had passed away, leaving the manor to her estranged nephew, Mr. Silas Blackwood. He was a recluse, rarely seen, and even more rarely heard from. Amy knew little about him except that he possessed an uncanny stillness, like a watchful gargoyle perched atop one of the mansion’s turrets.

The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and purple as Amy stepped inside. The air was thick with dust and silence, broken only by the creaking of floorboards beneath her worn slippers. She felt a pang of loneliness, a familiar ache that settled deep within her chest. 


Tonight, though, something felt different.  A sense of foreboding hung in the air, like a storm brewing on the horizon. As she made her way towards the library, where Mr. Blackwood sometimes sat for hours, a single flicker of light caught her eye – a faint glow emanating from the locked attic door at the end of the hallway. The door that was strictly forbidden.


Amy paused, heart pounding against her ribs. She wasn't supposed to go near the attic. But tonight, curiosity gnawed at her like an insistent hunger. 


She squared her shoulders and walked towards the attic door, the lavender polish on her dress suddenly smelling more like fear than comfort.
