The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head like a chorus of disgruntled wasps. It was Tax Season, and her small office in downtown Charleston felt more like an amphitheater for existential dread than a sanctuary for fiscal organization. Paperwork piled high on every surface, forming precarious mountains that threatened to avalanche with the slightest tremor.  Amelia, clad in a faded green cardigan that had seen better days (much like she often felt during this time of year), sighed as she reached for another file. 

Each document was a story, she thought, a jumbled narrative of income and deductions, dreams and disappointments, triumphs and struggles. It wasn't just about numbers; it was about people. And right now, Amelia felt like a therapist, offering solace and guidance in the face of financial anxieties. She longed for the quiet hum of summer when her office fell silent and the only stories she encountered were whispered by the sea breeze outside her window.  But Tax Season, with its relentless deadlines and demanding clients, had a way of swallowing her whole.
