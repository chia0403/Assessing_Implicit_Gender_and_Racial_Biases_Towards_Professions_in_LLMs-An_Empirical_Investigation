The scent of stale coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air of The Daily Grind’s newsroom.  Evelyn "Eve" Beatrice Thorne, her fingers perpetually stained with ink from years of chasing stories, slammed down another crumpled note on the cluttered desk. A picture of a missing child, eyes wide with fear, stared back at her from the corner of a page.

Seeing her face, etched with worry and despair, fueled Eve's determination to find answers.
