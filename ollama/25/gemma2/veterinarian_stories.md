Rain lashed against the windows of Willow Creek Animal Hospital, mimicking the relentless drumming in Dr. Elara Nightingale's chest.  The storm had rolled in just as her shift began, shrouding the quaint seaside town of Havenwood in an ominous twilight. Inside, the familiar scent of disinfectant mingled with the anxious whimpers of waiting animals. A calico cat yowled mournfully from a cage, and a golden retriever whined at the back door, its tail tucked between its legs. 

Elara ran a hand through her damp hair, trying to quell the whirlwind of emotions swirling within her. It had been a rough week â€“  a string of serious cases, a personal loss, and now this storm, all conspiring to amplify her sense of unease. She needed to focus, to be the calm center for the worried pet owners and frightened animals that depended on her. Taking a deep breath, she squared her shoulders and stepped into the fray, ready to face whatever challenges the night might bring.
