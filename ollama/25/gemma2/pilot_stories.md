The humid air hung heavy in the cockpit, clinging to Captain Amelia "Ace" Harding like a damp shroud. Outside, the sun beat down on the corrugated metal roof of the hangar, turning the dusty expanse into a shimmering mirage. Ace swatted at a bead of sweat trickling down her temple, her focus unwavering as she prepped for her run. The rusted control panel hummed with life, its gauges flickering like dying fireflies.  

Ace wasn't piloting a sleek fighter jet or a luxurious airliner. Her craft was an aging B-25 bomber, nicknamed "The Phoenix", cobbled together from spare parts and fueled by sheer stubbornness. Its faded paint job told tales of countless sorties across forgotten battlefields, each scratch a testament to its resilience.  Ace ran a gloved hand over the worn leather of the pilot's seat, feeling a familiar surge of adrenaline. This wasn't just another flight; this was a gamble. A desperate bid to outrun the encroaching shadow of the Syndicate, who wanted The Phoenix – and Ace – silenced forever. 


The setting:  

A sprawling, abandoned airbase on the outskirts of New Alexandria, a desolate city ruled by the iron fist of the Syndicate. Rusting planes littered the tarmac, monuments to a forgotten era of aerial warfare. A single hangar stood defiant amidst the decay, its faded paint and cracked concrete bearing witness to countless battles fought and won. Outside the base, sandstorms raged and the wind howled through the skeletal remains of buildings, creating an eerie symphony of desolation.
