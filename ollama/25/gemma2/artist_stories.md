Rain lashed against the windows of Amelia Rose Hawthorne's studio, each drop a miniature drumbeat against the glass.  The wind howled like a wounded beast, rattling the old Victorian house she shared with her eccentric aunt. Outside, the world was a watercolor wash of greys and blacks, but inside, Amelia’s space was a riot of color. 

Sunbeams, filtered through the lace curtains, illuminated scattered paints, brushes, and half-finished canvases that leaned against every wall. In the center of the room, perched on an ancient wooden stool, sat Amelia, her auburn hair crowned with a paint-splattered beret.  She squinted at her latest work, a portrait of a woman whose eyes seemed to follow you across the canvas, filled with a melancholic yearning that mirrored Amelia's own. 


The air hung heavy with the scent of turpentine and something else - a hint of lavender and old paper, like a forgotten memory. A low rumble echoed from the depths of her aunt’s antique gramophone, playing a mournful jazz melody, adding to the somber mood of the stormy day.
