The rain hammered against the corrugated iron roof of Detective Inspector Alistair Finch's office, mimicking the relentless drumming in his head. He sat hunched over his desk, the fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across a pile of case files that threatened to consume him whole. The stale aroma of coffee and desperation hung heavy in the air, a familiar scent in the precinct nicknamed "The Pit."  

Finch's city, Port Blackwood, was a sprawling labyrinth of rain-slicked streets and neon-drenched alleyways, perpetually shrouded in an oppressive fog that seemed to seep into your bones. Tonight, however, the fog had given way to a torrential downpour, turning the city into a canvas of glistening asphalt and overflowing gutters. The storm raged on, mirroring the turmoil brewing within Finch's mind as he stared at the latest crime scene photos â€“ a gruesome tableau of violence that left even him, a veteran officer with a seemingly inexhaustible capacity for grim acceptance, shaken to his core. 


This was no ordinary case. This was personal.
