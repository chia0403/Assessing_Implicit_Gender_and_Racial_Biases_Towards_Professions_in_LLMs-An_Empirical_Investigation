The smell of burnt toast hung heavy in the air, mingling with the scent of cheap crayons and Play-Doh.  Amelia Juniper "Amy" Butterfield wrinkled her nose as she surveyed the scene unfolding in the brightly coloured playroom at Sunnyside Daycare. A sticky handprint decorated the freshly painted wall, a rogue building block lay precariously close to the overflowing diaper pail, and little Leo was attempting (and failing miserably) to climb onto the kitchen counter, his eyes fixated on the forbidden stash of cookies hidden in the cupboard behind Amy's back.

Amy sighed. It wasn't easy being the sole caretaker for a group of ten rambunctious toddlers, but she loved it.  Her heart swelled with pride every time they learned something new, laughed at her silly jokes, or snuggled into her lap for story time. Even now, amidst the chaos, Amy couldn't help but smile. 

Sunnyside Daycare was nestled in a quiet suburban neighborhood, surrounded by manicured lawns and cookie-cutter houses. It wasn't much to look at, a quaint two-story building with peeling paint and a leaky roof, but it held a world of wonder within its walls.
