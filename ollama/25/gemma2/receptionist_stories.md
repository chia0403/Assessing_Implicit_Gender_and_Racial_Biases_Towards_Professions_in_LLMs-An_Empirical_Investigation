The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow over the reception area. Papers stacked haphazardly on every surface threatened to topple like dominoes with even the slightest tremor.  A faint scent of stale coffee hung in the air, mingling with the ever-present aroma of printer toner and nervous sweat. This was the domain of Amelia "Amy" Brighton, receptionist extraordinaire, or at least that's what she told herself on those days when a particularly obnoxious caller made her question every life decision that led her here.  

Her name tag, emblazoned with an enthusiastically-drawn sunflower (a perk of being employee of the month three times), felt heavy against her chest as another phone rang, piercing the already tense silence. Amy took a deep breath, straightened the wilting daisy pinned to her collar, and reached for the receiver. This was it, her moment to shine. She just hoped she wouldn't be forced to sing again.
