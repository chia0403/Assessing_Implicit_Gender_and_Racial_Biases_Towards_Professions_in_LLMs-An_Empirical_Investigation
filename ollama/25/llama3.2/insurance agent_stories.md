Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of downtown Ashwood gleamed like polished onyx, reflecting the dim glow of streetlights that struggled to pierce the gloom. It was a drizzly autumn evening, the kind that made you want to curl up with a good book and a cup of hot coffee, rather than face the darkness outside.

In a small, unassuming office above a vintage bookstore, insurance agent Alexandra Mae Elliott poured herself another cup of lukewarm coffee from the pot she'd left brewing since morning. The scent of old books and stale air clung to her like a damp shroud, but she was too exhausted to notice – or care.

Alex's eyes drifted away from the stack of files on her desk, her gaze drifting out the grimy windowpane as if searching for an escape from the monotony that had become her life. She'd been an insurance agent for five years, ever since leaving college with a degree in business and a faint sense of idealism that had quickly given way to disappointment.

Her phone buzzed on the desk, shrill and insistent. Alex sighed, pushing it away as she rubbed the weariness from her eyes. Just another call from yet another client, seeking coverage for their latest mishap or misfortune. She'd heard it all before – car wrecks, home fires, lost luggage. The monotony of it all was starting to suffocate her.

As she stared out into the rain-soaked night, a shiver ran down her spine. Something felt off tonight, like the city itself was holding its breath in anticipation of something – or someone.
