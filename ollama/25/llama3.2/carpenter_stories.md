Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The sun was setting over the small town of Ravenswood, casting a warm orange glow over the weathered wooden signs and rusty farm equipment that lined the main street. The air was thick with the smell of freshly cut wood and the sound of birds chirping in the nearby woods.

In a small workshop tucked away on Elm Street, carpenter Amos Everett Thompson was sanding down the rough edges of a beautiful oak table he had been commissioned to build for the town's annual Harvest Festival. His hands moved deftly over the wood, his calloused fingers feeling the grain and texture as he coaxed out the hidden beauty within.

Amos, a ruggedly handsome man in his mid-40s with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, was a master of his craft. He had learned the trade from his father, who had taught him everything from framing houses to building furniture from scratch.
