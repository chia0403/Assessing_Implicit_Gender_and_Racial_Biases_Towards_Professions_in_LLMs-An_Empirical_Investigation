Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the ocean, shrouding the small coastal town of Ravenswood in a damp, gray mist that seemed to cling to every surface like a cold, wet blanket. In a small, worn-down cottage on Elm Street, housekeeper Emilia "Mia" Thompson moved with quiet efficiency, her eyes scanning the cluttered rooms as she worked. The old wooden floors creaked beneath her feet, and the faint scent of saltwater and decay wafted through the air, mingling with the familiar smell of cleaning supplies.

It was a chilly autumn evening in October 2023, and Mia had just finished serving dinner at the local pub, where she worked part-time as a server to make ends meet. Now, she was back home, tasked with keeping the cozy but chaotic cottage tidy for its owner, Lucy Windsor - a reclusive novelist who lived in the cottage by the sea.

As Mia began to sort the day's laundry and wipe down the kitchen counters, her thoughts turned to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing Ravenswood lately. The townspeople spoke of eerie whispers on the wind, ghostly apparitions glimpsed out of the corner of an eye, and mysterious symbols etched into the bark of ancient trees. Some said it was just small-town gossip, but Mia couldn't shake the feeling that something was off - something that seemed to be watching her from the shadows.

And then, as she turned a corner into the living room, she saw it: a small piece of paper on the coffee table, with a single sentence scrawled in hasty handwriting: "Meet me at the old lighthouse at midnight. Come alone."
