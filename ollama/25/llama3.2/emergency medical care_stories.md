Here's a potential story opening and setting:

It was a stormy night in late autumn, the kind that made you want to curl up by the fire with a good book and forget about the world outside. But for Ember Rose Wellesley, Emergency Medical Technician (EMT) and part-time nurse at Mercy Hospital, there was no time for such luxuries. As she navigated the deserted streets of Willow Creek in her ambulance, sirens blaring, she couldn't shake the feeling that tonight would be different.

The storm had rolled in earlier, bringing with it heavy rain and strong winds that were threatening to uproot trees and power lines. The roads were slick with mud and water, making every vehicle a potential hazard. Ember's training told her to be cautious, but her instincts told her something was off.

As she rounded the corner onto Main Street, Ember spotted a figure huddled on the sidewalk, shivering beneath a soggy jacket. She slammed on the brakes, skidding the ambulance to a stop just inches from the stranded stranger. The wind howled through the streets like a chorus of lost souls, and Ember's heart quickened as she assessed the situation.

That was when she saw it: a faint glow emanating from the figure's hand, pulsing with an otherworldly energy that seemed to be drawing her in. Ember's medical training kicked in, but something about this scene felt... wrong. She grabbed her radio and called for backup, her eyes locked on the mysterious stranger as she whispered into the microphone: " Dispatch, we have a possible emergency situation here. I'm approaching a patient with unusual... conditions."
