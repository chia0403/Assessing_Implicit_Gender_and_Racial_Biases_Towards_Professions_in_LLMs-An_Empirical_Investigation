Here's a potential story opening:

The dimly lit workshop was a far cry from the gleaming skyscrapers of New Haven City, where Aurora "Rory" Wynter Thompson spent her days crafting intricate blueprints and architectural designs for the city's most ambitious projects. As a drafting worker at the esteemed firm of Wynter & Associates, Rory took pride in her work, pouring over lines and curves with precision and care.

It was a chilly autumn evening when Rory arrived at the office, her boots scuffling against the worn concrete floor as she made her way to her workstation. The smell of fresh paper and pencil shavings filled the air, mingling with the faint scent of rain outside. Rory smiled to herself, feeling a sense of contentment wash over her as she settled into her chair.

But little did she know, tonight would be different from any other night at the office. A mysterious client had requested a meeting with Rory personally, and the enigmatic letterman on his desk seemed to hold secrets that even she couldn't begin to fathom. As she unwrapped her lunch – a simple turkey sandwich and carrot sticks – and gazed out the rain-soaked window, Rory's mind began to whir with possibilities.
