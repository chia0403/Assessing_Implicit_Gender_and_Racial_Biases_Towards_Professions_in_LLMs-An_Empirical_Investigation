Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the rugged coastline of Ravenshire Cove, casting a warm orange glow over the small fishing village. Amidst the bustling harbor, where fishermen returned with their daily catch and merchants hawked their wares, stood the modest stone-cutting shop of Emrys ap Rhys.

Emrys, a sturdy-built man in his mid-30s with a strong jawline and piercing blue eyes, was busy at work in his workshop. His calloused hands moved deftly as he chiseled away at a block of grey granite, shaping it into a beautiful statue of a mermaid that would adorn the village's newly restored church. The sound of the stone scraping against the whetstone echoed through the air, accompanied by the occasional shout or laugh from the villagers below.

As Emrys worked, he gazed out to sea, his mind consumed by the strange dream he'd had the night before. In the dream, he'd seen a vision of Ravenshire Cove in ruins, the once-peaceful waters now churned with dark magic and the stone buildings crumbling into dust. The image had left him feeling unsettled, but also strangely... drawn to it.

Now, as he finished shaping the statue's tail and stepped back to admire his handiwork, Emrys couldn't shake the feeling that something was off in Ravenshire Cove. Something that would soon test his skills as a stone cutter â€“ and put his very life at risk.
