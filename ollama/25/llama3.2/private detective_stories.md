Here's a story opening and setting for you:

---

Rain poured down on the city like a dirty blanket, casting a gloomy shroud over the already downtrodden streets of Ashwood. The neon lights of the downtown bars and clubs reflected off the wet pavement, creating a gaudy spectacle that seemed to mock the desolation of the night air.

In a cramped, smoke-filled office above a pawn shop on Main Street, private detective August "Augie" Thompson sat hunched over his desk, sipping on a lukewarm cup of coffee. His eyes, a deep shade of brown with a perpetual crease in their center from years of squinting at the sun, scanned the stack of files and notes before him. The rain drummed against the metal roof above, making it sound like the city itself was trying to drown out the whispers of Augie's own troubled thoughts.

Augie, a man in his late forties with a rugged jawline and a mop of graying hair that seemed to be slowly receding from his forehead, had seen better days. His once-sharp mind now struggled to keep pace with the demands of a city that seemed determined to wear him down. But it was a job he'd taken on anyway - one that required him to navigate the dark underbelly of Ashwood, where corruption and deceit lurked around every corner.

Just as Augie was about to give up for the night, the phone on his desk jolted him back to reality with a shrill ring. He picked it up, hoping against hope that it wouldn't be another telemarketer or debt collector. But instead, he heard a hesitant voice on the other end of the line.

"August Thompson? Is that you?"
