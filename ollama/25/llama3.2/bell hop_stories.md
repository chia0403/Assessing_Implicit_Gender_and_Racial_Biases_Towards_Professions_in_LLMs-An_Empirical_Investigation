Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the last rays of sunlight faded from the dusty streets of New Haven, California, 22-year-old Edgar Winston Jenkins polished his reflection in the shiny surface of the hotel's reception desk. With a hint of pride, he smoothed out his crisp white uniform, adorned with the esteemed Golden Sun Hotel's logo emblazoned on the chest pocket. A bell hop since the age of 19, Edgar had seen it all – from the champagne-fueled revelries of honeymooners to the late-night whispers of illicit trysts between suitors.

The Golden Sun Hotel stood tall and proud, its Art Deco façade a testament to the city's rich history and nostalgia. Located on the outskirts of New Haven, where the desert met the horizon, the hotel had become an oasis for weary travelers seeking refuge from the scorching sun. Edgar loved nothing more than watching the stars twinkle to life above the city's palm-lined streets as he cruised around the hotel in his worn leather satchel, eager to assist the next guest who needed a helping hand.

Tonight was shaping up to be an interesting night – the phone had been ringing nonstop with reservations from out-of-town guests, and Edgar was itching to get behind the wheel of his trusty '68 Ford F-100, affectionately dubbed "Bertha." Little did he know, however, that this evening would bring more than just the usual hotel drama.
