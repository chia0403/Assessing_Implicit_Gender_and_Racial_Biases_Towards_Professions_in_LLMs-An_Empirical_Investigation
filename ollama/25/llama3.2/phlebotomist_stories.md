Here's a potential story opening and setting:

As the sun set over the small town of Oakdale, Illinois, Phoebe Elizabeth Thompson prepared for another long night at Mercy Hospital. She wiped down her workstations in the medical lab with a disinfectant wipe, the scent of antiseptic lingering on her skin as she began to mentally prepare for the evening's blood draws.

Phoebe, a senior phlebotomist at Oakdale Memorial Hospital, had worked the night shift for five years. She took pride in her work, knowing that even the smallest mistake could have significant consequences. As she checked the inventory of needles and swabs, she mentally reviewed the patient list for the evening: Mrs. Jenkins' follow-up appointment for chemotherapy treatment, a new patient scheduled for an ECG test after a heart attack, and the usual assortment of blood draws for dialysis patients.

The hospital's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an eerie glow over the rows of steel shelving units stocked with vials of medications and jars of reagents. Phoebe's colleagues would be filtering in soon, exchanging quiet hellos as they set up their workstations for the night ahead. But tonight felt different – a sense of unease settled in the pit of her stomach as she checked the overnight shift schedule for what might be a longer-than-usual wait.

With a deep breath, Phoebe shouldered her backpack, loaded with all the necessary supplies and personal items to make it through the long night ahead. She gave herself a quick once-over – dark hair tied back in a ponytail, tired eyes, but ready face set for whatever lay ahead. As she stepped into the sterile environment of the lab, Phoebe felt a familiar sense of calm wash over her. This was where she belonged – amidst the whirring machines and endless flow of patients' vital signs.

Little did she know, tonight would bring more than just routine blood draws...
