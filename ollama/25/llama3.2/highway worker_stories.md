Here's a potential story opening:

The sun was setting over the desolate stretch of Highway 13, casting a golden glow over the endless expanse of asphalt and concrete that stretched out before Ryder Jenson like an unforgiving sea. As a maintenance supervisor for the state highway department, Ryder had spent countless nights just like this one, trudging along the shoulder to inspect potholes and repair damaged guardrails under the harsh glare of his headlights.

Ryder was a rugged man in his late 30s, with a weathered complexion and eyes that seemed to hold a deep-seated tiredness. He had spent years working on the highways, watching as the seasons came and went, and the world around him changed in ways both big and small. Despite the isolation of his job, Ryder felt a strange sense of comfort in the solitude, a feeling that allowed him to clear his mind and focus on the task at hand.

As he walked along the highway, Ryder's eyes scanned the landscape for any sign of trouble. The weather forecast had predicted a storm system moving in overnight, and he knew that come morning, the roads would be slick with rain and potentially treacherous. He made a mental note to check the drainage culverts and make sure all the guardrails were secure, his trained instincts on high alert as he searched for any potential hazards.

Little did Ryder know, this night's routine would soon take an unexpected turn, one that would throw him off balance and force him to confront the secrets he had kept hidden for years.
