The sun had barely cracked the horizon over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm glow over the quiet streets and homes. Inside the worn wooden building that housed Oakdale High School, Ms. Emilia Elara Thompson was sipping her lukewarm coffee, scanning the morning news headlines on her phone. As she read about the latest school funding crisis in the district, her mind wandered to the stack of lesson plans she needed to grade before the day's first bell.

At 32, Ms. Thompson had already spent over a decade working as a high school English teacher in Oakdale, watching generations of students come and go through its doors. She knew every nook and cranny of the old building, from the creaky floorboards in the hallway to the worn armchairs in Mrs. Johnson's classroom. But despite her familiarity with the place, Thompson couldn't shake the feeling that something was about to disrupt the familiar rhythms of her life.

As she poured herself a fresh cup of coffee, the phone on her desk rang, shrill and insistent. It was the school's principal, calling to remind her that today was the day they were hosting a special meeting with the district superintendent, and Thompson had been tasked with leading a small group discussion on creative writing. She took a deep breath, mentally preparing herself for what promised to be a long and potentially grueling morning.
