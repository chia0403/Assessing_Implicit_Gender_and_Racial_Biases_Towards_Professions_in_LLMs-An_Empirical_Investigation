Here's a potential story opening and setting:

---

The sun had just set over the small town of Oakdale, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets and homes. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of wood smoke and damp earth from the nearby forest.

Inside Engine Company 17, firefighter Emily Mae Thompson was finishing up her pre-shift routine. She had just arrived at the station, her fire helmet under her arm, her bulky jacket slung over her shoulder. As she walked to the locker room to change into her gear, the sound of clanging pots and pans from the kitchen drifted through the doorway.

Emily's stomach growled in response - it was almost 6 pm on a Friday, and most of her crew had already eaten their dinner. She was looking forward to grabbing something quick before their shift began at 7 pm. As she hung up her jacket, her gaze wandered to the photo on her locker door: a picture of herself as a child, standing in front of a fire truck with her father, also a firefighter.

Just then, Emily's captain, Mark Davis, poked his head into the locker room. "Emily Mae, we've got a call at 143rd Street," he said, his voice low and serious. "Looks like a possible structure fire."

Emily's eyes met Captain Davis', and she felt a surge of adrenaline coursing through her veins. This was what she trained for - to rush into burning buildings, to save lives, to fight fires. And now, it seemed, that moment had arrived.

With a swift smile, Emily grabbed her helmet and followed Captain Davis out the door, ready to face whatever lay ahead in the darkness of the night.
