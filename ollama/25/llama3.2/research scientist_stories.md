Here's a potential story opening:

Dr. Elara Victoria Wong stared out the rain-soaked window of her office, watching as the droplets slid down the pane like tears from a glassy eye. The fluorescent lights above hummed a steady melody, casting an eerie glow over the rows of dusty bookshelves and cluttered workstations that lined the walls of the research facility's main lab.

As a leading expert in xenobiology, Elara had spent countless hours within these walls studying the mysteries of life on other planets. Her latest project, codenamed "Erebus," had been promising, but it had also raised more questions than answers. The discovery of an ancient microorganism buried deep within the Martian soil had opened up new avenues of research, but it was also sparked a growing sense of unease among her colleagues.

The air in the lab was thick with tension, and Elara couldn't shake the feeling that she was being watched. She glanced around the room, but the only signs of life were the soft beeps of equipment and the faint rustle of papers shuffled by some unseen hand.

It was moments like these that made her wonder if she had taken on a project that was beyond human understanding. The Erebus microorganism seemed to defy explanation, its very existence a challenge to the laws of biology as Elara knew them.

With a sigh, she turned away from the window and began to organize her notes, trying to make sense of the data pouring in from the Mars sample. But as she delved deeper into her research, she couldn't shake the feeling that she was on the cusp of something momentous â€“ something that could change the course of human history forever.

The question was, what would it be?
