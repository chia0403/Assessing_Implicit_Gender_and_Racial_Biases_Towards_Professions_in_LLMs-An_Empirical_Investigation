Here's a potential story opening:

The misty dawn broke over the sleepy town of Ravenswood, casting an eerie gloom over the crumbling Victorian houses and overgrown gardens that lined its streets. In one such house, on Elm Street, a lone figure emerged from the shadows of the garden shed. His name was Edwin Fletcher Winters, groundskeeper to the esteemed Winters family for nigh on twenty years. Edwin was a man of few words, with weathered skin and eyes as blue as the morning sky. He moved with a quiet purpose, his worn boots making barely a sound as he made his way through the overgrown paths and neglected flowerbeds.

As he began to clear away the autumn leaves that had accumulated on the lawn, Edwin's thoughts turned to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the Winters estate for weeks. Tools gone missing, garden plants uprooted in the dead of night, and an unshakeable feeling of being watched by unseen eyes. The usually stoic groundskeeper couldn't shake the sense that something was amiss on his beloved domain.

Little did Edwin know, the mysteries he had been ignoring would soon spill out into the daylight, threatening to upend his quiet existence and forever change the Winters estate.
