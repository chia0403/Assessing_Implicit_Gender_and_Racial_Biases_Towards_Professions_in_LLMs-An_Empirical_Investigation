Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Emmeline "Emmie" Rose Thompson stood at the edge of the lake, the misty dawn air clinging to her skin like a damp shroud. The trees surrounding the water's edge seemed to lean in, their branches tangled together like skeletal fingers, as if sharing a dark secret. It was a scene that would have been out of place in the midst of suburban New Jersey, but this particular stretch of the lake was an anomaly – a place where the rural wilderness met the urban sprawl.

As a forensic psychologist with the local police department, Emmie had seen her fair share of trauma and tragedy. But there was something about this spot that seemed to stir up a primal fear within her, a sense of unease that she couldn't quite shake. Perhaps it was the way the light danced across the ripples on the water, creating an otherworldly glow, or maybe it was the whispered rumors of strange occurrences and unexplained disappearances that haunted this very spot for decades.

Whatever the reason, Emmie felt a shiver run down her spine as she gazed out at the lake. It was a feeling she knew all too well, one that signaled to her mind that something was about to go horribly wrong. And yet, despite her best efforts to prepare herself, she couldn't shake the sense that this particular case was going to be different – that it would unravel a thread of terror and deceit that would lead her down a path from which there was no return.

With a deep breath, Emmie turned away from the lake and began the long walk back to her car, the darkness gathering around her like a living entity. Little did she know, her world was about to be turned upside down in ways she never could have imagined.
