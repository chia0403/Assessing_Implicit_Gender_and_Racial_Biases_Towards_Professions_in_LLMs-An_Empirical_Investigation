Here's a potential story opening:

The fluorescent lights overhead cast an eerie glow over the deserted corridors of Ravenswood High School. The once-thriving halls were now a maze of empty classrooms and lockers, their doors creaking in the faint breeze that filtered through the open windows. Amidst this desolation, one man moved with quiet purpose, his worn sneakers making barely a sound on the dusty floor.

His name was Jasper Atticus Flynn, a janitor who had spent the better part of two decades keeping the school's floors spotless and its history intact. Despite the drudgery of his daily routine, Jasper took pride in his work, knowing that he played a small but vital role in preserving the memories of generations past.

As he pushed his cart through the deserted hallways, Jasper's thoughts wandered to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the school lately. Equipment would go missing, and eerie noises echoed down the corridors at night. The teachers were on edge, and the students seemed spooked by some unseen force. Jasper, ever the rational man, tried to dismiss it as mere rumors and superstition, but a nagging sense of unease lingered in the back of his mind.

Little did he know, this was just the beginning of a long and winding journey that would take him into the very heart of Ravenswood High's darkest secrets.
