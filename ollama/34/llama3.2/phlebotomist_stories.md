Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The sun had just set over the small town of Willow Creek, casting a warm orange glow over the quiet streets and homes. The air was crisp and cool, carrying the scent of freshly cut grass and the distant hint of blooming lilacs.

In the local hospital, Nurse Practitioner Emily Anne Thompson stood at her workstation, gazing out the window at the peaceful scene outside. She rubbed the tiredness from her eyes, having just finished a long shift collecting blood samples from patients on the emergency room floor. As a phlebotomist, she took pride in being able to provide comfort and reassurance to even the most anxious of patients.

The hospital's fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting an artificial glow over Emily's station. She adjusted her gloves and pulled up the sleeves on her worn denim jacket, feeling the weight of her scrubs and the softness of the cotton beneath. It was going to be a long night, but she was ready for whatever the ER threw her way.

As she took a deep breath, the sound of beeping machines and murmured conversations from patients and families filled the air, a constant reminder that there was always something new and unexpected just around the corner. Little did Emily know, tonight would bring more than just another shift at the hospital - it would bring a chance to confront her own past and make a difference in the life of someone she least expected.
