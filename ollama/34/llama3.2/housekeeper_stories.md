The warm sunlight streaming through the grimy window cast an eerie glow on the dusty floorboards as Amelia Rose Thompson began her daily routine. She had been the housekeeper at Ravenswood Manor for five years, and in that time, she had grown accustomed to the intricate web of secrets and lies that seemed to seep from every crack in the old stone walls.

Amelia's worn hands moved deftly as she swept the cobweb-covered chandeliers, her eyes scanning the room with a practiced air of disinterest. The once-grand foyer now felt more like a relic of a bygone era, its faded opulence a reminder that even the wealthiest among them were not immune to time and neglect.

As she worked, Amelia's mind wandered back to the peculiar events of the previous night. She had caught glimpses of the family gathered in hushed whispers, their faces aglow with an unsettling intensity. It was as if they were waiting for something - or someone - on the other side of the door.

Amelia's thoughts were interrupted by the soft knock at the door from Mrs. Jenkins, the housekeeper who worked alongside her. "Good morning, Amelia," Mrs. Jenkins said, her voice low and conspiratorial. "The mistress wants to see you in her chambers. Something about a... package."

Amelia's heart skipped a beat as she set down her dustpan and looked up at Mrs. Jenkins with a curious expression. A package? What could the mistress possibly need from Amelia herself?

With a sense of trepidation, Amelia rose from her crouched position and made her way towards the mistress's chambers, wondering what secrets lay hidden behind the heavy velvet drapes.
