Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The rain-soaked streets of New Orleans gleamed like polished onyx as Amelia Rose Dubois stepped out of her office building, her worn leather satchel slung over one shoulder. As an architect specializing in historic preservation, Amelia had spent the past decade uncovering the secrets of the city's crumbling grandeur, from the French Quarter's balconied mansions to the ornate ironwork of the Garden District.

The humid air clung to her skin like a damp shroud as she gazed out at the City Park, its towering oaks and ancient cypress trees looming above the Spanish moss-draped sidewalks. The scent of magnolias and decay wafted up from the Bayou St. John, where a lone alligator basked in the murky shallows.

Amelia's thoughts were consumed by the latest project to occupy her time: the restoration of the crumbling Creole townhouse on Magazine Street, rumored to be the birthplace of jazz itself. As she walked towards her waiting car – a vintage MGB 2800E adorned with faded New Orleans flags and stickers from every local art collective – Amelia felt the familiar thrill of anticipation, knowing that beneath its faded facade, the old house held secrets waiting to be unearthed.

Little did she know, however, that this was only the beginning of a journey that would unravel her carefully constructed world and force her to confront the ghosts of her own past.
