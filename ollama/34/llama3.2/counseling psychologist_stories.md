Here's a potential story opening and setting:

Dr. Alexandra "Lexi" Thompson stepped out of her office and into the crisp autumn air, taking a deep breath as she gazed out at the sprawling city skyline. As a counseling psychologist with a private practice on the upper floor of a modest office building in downtown Seattle, Lexi had grown accustomed to the hum of conversation and the soft glow of fluorescent lights that illuminated the bustling streets below.
