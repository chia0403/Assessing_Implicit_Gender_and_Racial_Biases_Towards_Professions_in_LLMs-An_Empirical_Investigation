In his small office above the local diner, insurance agent Julian Edwin Blackwood sipped on a lukewarm cup of coffee, staring out at the deserted street below. The flickering fluorescent lights overhead cast a pale glow on the stacks of files and dusty binders that lined his shelves.

He was known around here as the go-to agent for all their insurance needs, but beneath the friendly smile and quick wit, Julian harbored a secret anxiety - one that had been brewing since the sudden passing of his best friend and colleague just six months prior.

The streets were still quiet, save for the occasional rumble of the diner's kitchen and the distant hum of the highway.
