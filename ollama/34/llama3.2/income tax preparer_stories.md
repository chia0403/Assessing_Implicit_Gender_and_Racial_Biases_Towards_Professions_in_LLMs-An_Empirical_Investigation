Here's a potential story opening:

It was a chilly autumn morning in late October when Alexandra "Alex" Thompson stepped out of her small office building on Main Street, gazing out at the vibrant fall foliage that blanketed the quaint town of Oakdale. As an experienced income tax preparer and owner of Thompson Tax Services, Alex had spent countless hours cooped up with her clients, crunching numbers and navigating the complexities of the tax code. But as she took a deep breath of the crisp morning air, she couldn't help but feel a sense of restlessness wash over her. The annual rush was coming to an end, and with it, the quiet lull that would allow her to recharge before the next busy season.

Alex had always been drawn to the precision and organization required for tax preparation, finding solace in the predictability of numbers and the satisfaction of helping her clients navigate the often-mysterious world of taxes. But as she walked back to her car, parked under a sprawling oak tree that seemed to lean in towards her like an old friend, Alex couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease had been growing inside her all week, fueled by whispers of trouble brewing among Oakdale's residents.

As she locked up her office and headed home, Alex couldn't help but wonder what secrets were hidden beneath the town's idyllic surface, waiting to be uncovered. Little did she know that this quiet autumn morning would mark the beginning of a year filled with mystery, intrigue, and personal danger.
