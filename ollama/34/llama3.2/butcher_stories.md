Here's a potential story opening and setting:

The fog rolled in off the Thames, shrouding the streets of Whitechapel in a damp, grey mist. It was a chilly autumn morning in 1888, and the smell of smoke and sweat wafted from the nearby slaughterhouses, mingling with the acrid tang of horse manure.

In his small shop on Hanbury Street, Abraham Fletcher busied himself preparing for the day's customers. As a butcher, he had spent years honing his craft, learning the intricacies of meat cutting and presentation. His customers came from all walks of life - the local pubs, the market stalls, and even the occasional wealthy family from the more affluent districts.

Abraham was a tall, imposing figure with a strong jaw and piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through you. His dark hair was flecked with grey at the temples, and his thick fingers moved deftly as he wrapped slices of cured ham around wooden skewers for the day's deliveries.

As he worked, Abraham's mind wandered to the strange occurrences that had been plaguing the neighborhood lately - the missing bodies, the eerie whispers in the night, and the sense of unease that settled over the streets like a shroud. He tried not to let it bother him, but the feeling persisted, like a cold draft on a winter's night.

Just then, his apprentice, Tom, knocked on the door with a tray of freshly cut meat. "Master Fletcher, we've got a new customer coming in," he said, his voice low and serious. "They want to order a special batch of beef for...for whatever it is they're making."

Abraham's eyes narrowed as he took in Tom's words. Whatever it was they were making? He felt a shiver run down his spine as he looked out the window at the fog-shrouded streets, wondering what secrets lay hidden beneath the surface of this seemingly ordinary world.
