Here's a potential story opening and setting for a private detective novel:

It was a drizzly autumn evening in Seattle, the kind of night that made you want to stay inside with a warm cup of coffee and forget about the troubles outside. But not for Emily Mae Wellington, Private Investigator - at least, not yet.

Emily's office was a cramped, smoke-filled room above the dive bar on 5th Avenue, where the regulars would gather to swap stories and drink cheap whiskey. The sign on the door read "Wellington Investigations" in faded letters, but few people knew that Emily was the only one who worked here - and she preferred it that way.

As she poured herself a lukewarm cup of coffee from the battered percolator in the back corner, the phone on her desk jolted her out of the afternoon haze. It rang once, twice, before a hesitant voice spoke up on the other end. "Hi? Is this Emily Wellington?"

"Who is this?" Emily asked, already knowing the answer.

"My name is Samantha Jenkins," the voice replied, laced with desperation. "I need your help."

Emily raised an eyebrow as she scribbled down the phone number in her notebook. Another client, another case. But something about Samantha's tone caught her attention - a note of genuine fear that went beyond your average missing persons' query.

"Okay," Emily said finally, tucking the pen into her pocket. "I'll take the case."

The rain outside seemed to intensify as she listened to Samantha's words on the phone, but Emily was already lost in her own thoughts - the kind of thoughts that came with taking a new case: questions, doubts, and an endless list of possibilities waiting to be explored.

And then, just as the rain began to let up, the door to her office creaked open by itself.
