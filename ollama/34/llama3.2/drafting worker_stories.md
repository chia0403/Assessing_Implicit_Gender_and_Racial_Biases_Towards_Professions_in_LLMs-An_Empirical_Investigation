Here's a potential story opening:

The rain-soaked streets of London gleamed like polished stone as Asher Felix Wellington trudged through the downpour, his worn leather satchel slung over his shoulder and his eyes fixed on the pavement ahead. As a skilled draughtsman, Asher had spent countless hours hunched over drafting tables in cramped offices, pouring his talents into the intricacies of architectural design. But tonight, he was bound for the docks, where his latest commission awaited - a massive, ornate drawing for the new railway terminus on the Isle of Dogs.

The gas lamps flickered like fireflies as Asher navigated the narrow alleys and courtyards of Whitechapel, the smell of coal smoke and damp earth filling his nostrils. It was a far cry from the bright lights and grandeur of the city's high society, but it was here, in this hidden corner of London, that Asher felt most at home.

As he turned onto Hanbury Street, the sound of laughter and music drifted out of the local pub, mingling with the distant clang of hammer on anvil from the nearby blacksmith. It was a night like any other in this part of town - but for Asher Felix Wellington, it was about to become one he would never forget.

How's that?
