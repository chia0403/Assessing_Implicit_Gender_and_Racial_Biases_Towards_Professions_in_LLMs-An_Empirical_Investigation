Here's a story opening and setting for you:

The rain-soaked streets of Tokyo gleamed like polished onyx as Emiko Nakahara stepped out of the office building, her bright pink umbrella a stark contrast to the drizzly grey sky. She took a deep breath, letting the damp air fill her lungs, and gazed up at the towering skyscrapers that seemed to stretch on forever. The neon lights of the city's billboards cast a colorful glow over the crowded sidewalks, but Emiko's eyes were fixed on the small café across the street.

She had just finished a long day of work as secretary to the enigmatic CEO of Nakamura Industries, and all she wanted was a warm cup of green tea and a moment of peace. As she walked towards the café, the sounds of the city seemed to fade into the background, replaced by the gentle hum of conversation from the cozy interior.

Emiko pushed open the door, letting out a sigh of relief as the warm air enveloped her. The scent of fresh coffee wafted through the air, mingling with the sweet aroma of baked goods, and Emiko's stomach growled in anticipation. She made her way to the counter, exchanging pleasantries with the owner, Mrs. Tanaka, who smiled knowingly as she took Emiko's order.

"Just what you need after a long day," Mrs. Tanaka said, handing Emiko a steaming cup of matcha green tea.

Emiko took a sip, feeling the bitterness wash over her taste buds, and closed her eyes, letting out a contented sigh. It was moments like these that reminded her why she loved working in Tokyo – the vibrant energy of the city, the kindness of its people, and the simple joys of life's everyday pleasures.

But as she sipped her tea, Emiko couldn't shake off the feeling that something was off. A nagging sense of unease had been lurking at the back of her mind all day, like a ghostly presence that refused to be exorcised. She tried to push it aside, focusing on the warm comfort of her tea and the peaceful atmosphere of the café.

Little did she know, her life was about to take a dramatic turn...
