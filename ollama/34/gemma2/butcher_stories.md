The reek of iron and sawdust hung heavy in the air, clinging to Silas Bartholomew Butchersmith's apron like a second skin. The midday sun sliced through the grimy windowpanes of his shop, illuminating dust motes dancing in the stale air. Outside, Covent Garden buzzed with market-goers haggling over turnips and plump pigeons, but inside 'Butchersmith & Sons', silence reigned except for the rhythmic thud of Silas' cleaver against bone. 

He was a man carved from the same rough granite as his shop: sturdy, weathered, and undeniably strong. Years spent wielding knives had etched lines around his eyes, each furrow a testament to a thousand cuts, both literal and figurative. Today, though, the usual grimace that adorned Silas' face was replaced by a flicker of... anticipation. He wasn't just preparing a Sunday roast; he was cleaving the final piece of pork belly for Mr. Fitzwilliamâ€™s notorious 'Pigs in Blanket' competition, an event that held more prestige in London than any royal banquet. 


This year, Silas felt, his meticulously bred Berkshire pig had a fighting chance.  He just hoped the judges wouldn't be swayed by the usual flashy displays from the bigger butchers. This time, he would prove that quality, not quantity, was king.
