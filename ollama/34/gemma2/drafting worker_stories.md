The acrid scent of burnt graphite hung heavy in the air, clinging to Elara Anyaev’s worn woolen scarf like a second skin. Outside, the steel city of Zenith pulsed with relentless energy, its towering spires piercing the perpetual twilight sky. Inside the cramped workshop, however, time seemed to move at a slower pace, measured by the scratch of Elara’s charcoal pencil against parchment and the rhythmic whirring of the drafting machine beside her. 

Elara Anyaev, known simply as "Ellie" by her colleagues, hunched over her worktable, her brow furrowed in concentration.  The latest blueprint lay before her, a tangled web of complex lines and intricate details that represented the skeletal framework of Zenith's newest skyscraper – The Apex Tower. It was a project both exhilarating and daunting, a testament to the city's relentless ambition, but also a burden for a young draftswoman struggling to make her mark in a world dominated by men.  


The workshop was a hive of activity, buzzing with the murmur of conversation and the clatter of tools. Fellow draftsmen, their faces illuminated by the dim glow of gas lamps, hunched over their own projects, creating the blueprints that would shape Zenith's future. Elara felt a familiar pang of loneliness amidst the camaraderie; she yearned to contribute more than just precise lines and calculated measurements. She dreamt of designing buildings that soared not only in height but also in imagination, structures that spoke to the human spirit rather than simply serving utilitarian purposes.
