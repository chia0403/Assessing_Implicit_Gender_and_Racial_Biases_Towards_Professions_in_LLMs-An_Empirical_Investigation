The stale smell of disinfectant battled with the sweetness of jasmine tea, the two scents mingling uncomfortably in the air of Amelia Rose Sterling's small practice. Sunlight streamed through the window, illuminating dust motes dancing in the warm air. A framed print of a vibrant garden hung lopsidedly on the wall, its colours clashing with the sterile white walls and pale blue cabinets that dominated the space. 

Amelia sighed, adjusting her tortoiseshell glasses. The morning had started like any other: clients cancelling appointments last minute, insurance forms mysteriously going missing, and a constant drip-drip of self-doubt whispering in her ear. She longed for the days when she’d dreamed of transforming lives through nutrition, not just filling out paperwork and navigating the bureaucratic labyrinth of healthcare.  


Amelia glanced at the clock – 9:45 am. Her next appointment, Mr. Harold Finch, was due any minute.  He’d been referred by his doctor with a laundry list of ailments, all tied to his unhealthy diet. He'd promised last week to bring detailed food journals, but Amelia wasn't holding her breath. This job was rarely about the patients' willingness to change; it was more about nudging them in the right direction, sometimes through sheer force of will. 


She smoothed down her crisp white blouse and took a deep breath, ready for whatever Mr. Finch (and the day) threw at her.
