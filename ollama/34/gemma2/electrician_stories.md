The air hung thick with the scent of ozone and burnt wiring.  Sparks showered down like miniature fireworks as Elias Thorne wrestled with the faulty conduit in Mrs. Patterson’s basement. He cursed under his breath, wiping sweat from his brow with a grease-stained rag. The humid July night felt more like a sauna, every inch of his body clammy and aching. 

Elias was a master electrician, capable of coaxing power from even the most stubborn wiring, but Mrs. Patterson’s ancient house seemed determined to resist him. He'd been summoned after her lights flickered erratically for weeks, culminating in a full-blown blackout last night.  A single bare bulb cast long shadows on the dusty tools scattered around him, illuminating cobwebs that hung like ghostly curtains. Outside, cicadas chirped their relentless summer song, providing a soundtrack to Elias's frustration. He knew he was close to solving the mystery - it was just a matter of finding the right wire, the right connection, before Mrs. Patterson had another dark night.


**Setting:** The humid basement of an old Victorian house in a quiet suburban neighborhood, circa late 1980s.
