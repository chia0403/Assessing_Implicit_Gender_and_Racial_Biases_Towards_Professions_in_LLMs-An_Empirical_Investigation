It sat perched atop a hill overlooking the sleepy town of Willow Creek, a place where time seemed to move at a slower pace, where secrets lingered like dust motes in sunbeams. Silas felt a prickle of unease, an instinctive awareness that beneath the picturesque facade, something lurked - a story waiting to be unraveled.
