The air in The Sweatbox thrummed with anticipation.  It wasn't just the pulsing beat of 'Canâ€™t Hold Us' by Macklemore blasting through the speakers; it was the collective energy of twenty sweaty bodies stretching and giggling nervously at the front of the room. 

Standing tall at the head of this writhing, hopeful mass was Serena Jade Blackwood, her bright pink leggings practically vibrating with energy as she surveyed her class.  Serena loved this feeling - the raw potential buzzing in the air before the first beat dropped. She could already feel the tension melting away as they moved, morphing into something lighter, stronger, more alive. 

The Sweatbox itself was a haven for those seeking solace in movement. Tucked away on a quiet side street in Brooklyn, it wasn't your typical sterile gym.  Dim lighting, exposed brick walls adorned with inspirational quotes, and the scent of eucalyptus oil hung heavy in the air. The floor, cushioned by thick mats, vibrated with every thump of the bassline. 


Serena took a deep breath, grinned, and shouted over the music, "Alright guys, are you ready to sweat?"
