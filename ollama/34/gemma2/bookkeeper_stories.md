The flickering gaslight cast long, dancing shadows across Eleanor Pettigrew's cluttered desk. Dust motes swirled in the pale yellow light, catching briefly on her spectacles as she squinted at the ledgers before her. The air was thick with the smell of old paper and pipe tobacco – a familiar scent that clung to every corner of Mr. Fitzwilliam's antique bookshop. 

Eleanor, a woman of meticulous habits and unwavering order in a world of chaos, sighed softly. Tonight, the chaos was particularly pronounced. A stack of unpaid invoices threatened to topple over like a Jenga tower, each one a silent reminder of Mr. Fitzwilliam's absent-mindedness. He’d forgotten his own birthday last week – a feat that had left Eleanor both amused and exasperated.  

The bookshop itself was nestled on a narrow cobblestone street in Edinburgh, shrouded in perpetual twilight thanks to the towering buildings that squeezed out the sun. Rain hammered against the shop window, blurring the world outside into a watercolour wash of greys and greens.  Eleanor pushed back her chair, stretching her stiff shoulders. The rain had arrived just as she was finishing her work – a welcome respite from the stifling heat of the day, but also a cruel reminder that she was locked in this dusty haven until Mr. Fitzwilliam returned.
