The smell of crayons and hand sanitizer hung heavy in the air, a potent mix that could only mean one thing: it was Monday morning at Sunnyside Kindergarten. Miss Elara Everly smoothed down her floral dress, its cheerful pattern clashing slightly with the stark white walls of the classroom. She took a deep breath, trying to ignore the lingering scent of spilled juice from last week's "Taste Test Tuesday" and focus on the day ahead.  

Elara loved kindergarten. The wide-eyed wonder, the boundless energy, the sticky fingers clutching freshly colored masterpieces - it was all pure magic. But this year felt different. A new principal, a stricter curriculum, and whispers of budget cuts hung like storm clouds over Sunnyside, threatening to dampen the joy she had always found in teaching these little humans.  As the first wave of tiny bodies poured into the classroom, chattering excitedly about their weekend adventures, Elara forced a smile. 

Today, more than ever, she needed to be sunshine.
