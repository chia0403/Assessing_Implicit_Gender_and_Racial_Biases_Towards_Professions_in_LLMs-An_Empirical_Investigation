The scent of rain-soaked asphalt and lilies mingled in the air outside Dr. Eleanor Violet Blackwood's office. A soft melancholy hung over the city, mirroring the heavy atmosphere within her therapy room. 

Eleanor watched as Liam fidgetted with his hands, twisting and turning them like they held a tangled secret. She knew he was struggling. The tremor in his voice, the fleeting shadows that crossed his eyes â€“ these were telltale signs of someone drowning in their own thoughts. Her office, usually a haven for whispered confessions and shared vulnerabilities, felt strangely claustrophobic tonight. 


Liam had been her patient for months, battling anxiety so severe it had begun to consume him.  But tonight, there was something different. A new layer of despair hung over Liam like a shroud, threatening to pull him further under. Eleanor knew she had to find out what had changed. It wouldn't be easy, but as a clinical psychologist, her duty was to guide Liam back to the light, even if it meant navigating the darkest corners of his mind.
