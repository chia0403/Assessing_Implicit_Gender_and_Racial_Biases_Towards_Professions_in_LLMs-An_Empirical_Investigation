The scent of hand sanitizer and crayon wax clung to Amelia Celeste Finch like a second skin. It was always this way at Sunshine Daycare, a kaleidoscope of sticky fingers, rambunctious laughter, and the occasional whimper that sent a shiver down Amelia's spine. She loved it, of course. Loved the messy chaos, the boundless energy, the tiny humans who saw the world with wide-eyed wonder. But sometimes, when the day wore long and the toddlers were particularly relentless, even Amelia yearned for a sliver of quiet, a moment to simply breathe.

Today was one of those days. The sun beat down on the daycare's bright yellow building, turning the plastic jungle gym into a furnace and the air thick with humidity.  Amelia wiped her brow with a damp cloth, trying in vain to keep the sweat out of her eyes as she watched Timmy, a two-year-old whirlwind with a penchant for throwing his juice box at unsuspecting classmates, climb precariously on top of the bookshelf. 


"Timmy," Amelia said, her voice strained but calm, "Come down from there please."

Timmy ignored her, engrossed in rearranging the collection of brightly coloured board books. He plopped one unceremoniously onto the floor, sending a tiny paper airplane soaring through the air.  The other children erupted in cheers, their attention momentarily diverted from the ongoing juice box throwing war. Amelia sighed, knowing this was just the calm before the next storm.
