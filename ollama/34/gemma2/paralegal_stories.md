The stale smell of coffee hung in the air, mingling with the ever-present scent of paper and printer ink. Rain lashed against the windows of Miller & Finch, blurring the already dim cityscape outside. Amelia Beatrice Cartwright, or Amy as everyone called her (except her mother, who insisted on the full and formidable "Amelia"), tapped a manicured nail against the worn surface of her desk. The glow of her computer screen illuminated her tired face, casting sharp shadows across the cluttered space. 

She squinted at the email from Mr. Finch himself - an emergency meeting about the Harper case. Amy knew this wouldn't be good. The Harper case was their most high-profile one yet, a tangled web of corporate espionage and deceit that threatened to engulf them all. She braced herself, knowing this rain wasn't just outside; it was brewing within her own small world at Miller & Finch.
