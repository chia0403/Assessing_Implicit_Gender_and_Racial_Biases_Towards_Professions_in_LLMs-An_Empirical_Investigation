The aroma of warm yeast and caramelized sugar hung heavy in the air, a comforting blanket over the bustling Saturday morning market. Sunlight streamed through the canvas awning of "Eliza's Everlasting Eats," illuminating the rainbow of pastries arranged on tiered stands.  Eliza Primrose, her flour-dusted cheeks flushed with a mix of heat from the ovens and excitement for the day ahead, surveyed her handiwork with a critical eye.

Eliza loved this time of day â€“ the energy was palpable, a vibrant hum that matched the rhythm of her heart as she prepared for another busy Saturday.
