The biting wind whipped across the desolate plains, stinging Elias Thorne's face with icy needles. He hunched deeper into his worn leather jerkin, tugging the fur collar tight against the encroaching chill. The pale moon hung like a spectral eye in the vast, ink-black sky, casting long, distorted shadows from the windswept dunes that stretched endlessly before him. 

Elias was alone, stationed at the crumbling watchtower that marked the northernmost point of Eldoria's border. It had been weeks since he’d seen another soul – weeks punctuated by the endless howl of the wind and the occasional screech of a sand viper, its venomous fangs glinting in the moonlight. The tower itself was a testament to time's relentless march:  cracked stone walls held together by rusted iron bands, crumbling stairs leading to an equally dilapidated watch platform, and a single flickering torch casting weak illumination within its dusty confines. 

Tonight, Elias felt a prickle of unease crawl up his spine. A stillness had fallen over the plains, an unnatural silence that pressed against him like a suffocating blanket. The wind had died down, leaving only the rasping breath of the dying fire in the hearth and the relentless thudding of his own heart.


He gripped the hilt of his sword, its familiar weight grounding him in the midst of the unnerving quiet. This was his duty: to stand watch, to be vigilant against any threat that might cross the border. But tonight, something felt different. Something whispered on the wind, a silent promise of danger lurking just beyond the pale moonlight.
