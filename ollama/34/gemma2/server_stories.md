The aroma of sizzling garlic butter and wilting lettuce hung heavy in the air, a familiar perfume to Amelia Beatrice Thorne, more commonly known as Mia to her regulars at The Rusty Spoon diner.  It was 7:30 PM on a Wednesday, prime time for hungry truckers, weary tourists, and locals looking for a greasy spoon fix. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the checkered linoleum floor that had seen countless spills, conversations, and broken hearts. Mia weaved between sticky tables, balancing a tray laden with steaming mugs of coffee and plates piled high with fluffy pancakes, her smile as practiced and bright as the chrome diner counter behind her.  But beneath the surface, a storm was brewing. Mia felt it in the tightness in her chest, the quickening of her pulse - tonight wasn't just another Wednesday. 


**Setting:** The Rusty Spoon Diner, a classic roadside diner with red vinyl booths, a checkered floor, and a worn counter where patrons gather for coffee, pie, and friendly chatter. It's located on a dusty stretch of highway in a small town somewhere between nowhere and everywhere.
