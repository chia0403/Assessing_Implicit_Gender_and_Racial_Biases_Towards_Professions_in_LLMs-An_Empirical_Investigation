The scent of sandalwood and lavender hung heavy in the air, a calming veil over the bustling city just outside. Inside "Tranquil Touch," nestled on a quiet side street, Amelia Rose Hawthorne meticulously prepared her room for the evening's client. She warmed the heated massage stones, their smooth surfaces glowing with an inviting amber light, and dimmed the overhead lamps, casting the space in a soft, welcoming glow. 

Amelia adjusted her lavender silk robe, smoothing down the wrinkles that always seemed to gather despite her best efforts. Her hands, strong from years of kneading tension out of tight muscles, rested lightly on the counter as she waited for the client's arrival. Tonight, Amelia was expecting a first-timer, someone new to the calming embrace of therapeutic massage. She hoped they would leave feeling lighter, less burdened by the weight of the world that pressed down on everyone in this city. 


The faint chime of the door bell announced her first appointment of the evening.  Amelia smiled, smoothing her hands once more before opening the door to welcome them into her sanctuary.
