The scent of lavender and stale ammonia hung thick in the air, a familiar perfume that always clung to Eleanor "Ellie" Willowbrook's clothes, even after she’d showered twice. She ran a gloved hand over the worn surface of her barber shears, their silver glinting under the harsh fluorescent lights of “Willowbrook’s Cuts and Curls.” 

It was Tuesday afternoon, usually a slow spell in the small-town barbershop nestled on Main Street. Rain lashed against the dusty windows, blurring the world outside into an impressionistic watercolor of greys and greens. Ellie sighed, watching as droplets traced paths down the windowpane. She'd been running this place for fifteen years, ever since her father, a man whose booming laugh had once echoed through these very walls, passed away. 

She missed him, that much was certain. His chair sat empty in the corner, draped with a faded green cloth like a mourning veil.  He would have loved this weather, she thought, grumbling about how it kept the folks indoors and gave him an excuse to bake his famous apple pies. Ellie wasn't much of a baker, but her father's legacy lived on in the worn wooden floorboards and the faded photos lining the walls – reminders of a time when the barbershop was more than just a place for haircuts; it was the heart of their community.


Today, however, even that familiar warmth felt distant. A strange quiet hung over Willowbrook’s Cuts and Curls, broken only by the rhythmic click-clack of Ellie's shears against her empty customer's hair mannequin. The storm outside seemed to mirror the unease settling in her chest.
