The flickering fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch, casting a sterile glow over the worn reception desk. Her perfectly manicured nails tapped impatiently against the smooth mahogany surface. It was 3:57 pm, and the clock on the wall seemed to be mocking her with its relentless ticking. A bead of sweat trickled down her temple, ignored as she stared at the phone, waiting for it to ring. 

She worked at Finch & Sons, a law firm that had been in her family for generations. It wasn't glamorous, but it was secure, reliable. And, let's be honest, Amelia couldn't imagine doing anything else. This office, with its worn carpets and faded paintings of stern-faced ancestors, felt like a warm embrace, a comforting reminder of her roots. 

However, today, the comfort felt stifling. Today, she was waiting for a call that could change everything. A call from the headhunter who had promised Amelia a chance to break free from the confines of Finch & Sons, to escape the predictable humdrum and dive into the thrilling world of corporate law.  


**Setting:** 

A dimly lit reception area in a traditional law firm, with dark wood furniture, faded paintings of stern-looking men in suits, and an atmosphere that suggests time has stood still. It's slightly stuffy and quiet, punctuated only by the hum of fluorescent lights and the ticking of a grandfather clock.
