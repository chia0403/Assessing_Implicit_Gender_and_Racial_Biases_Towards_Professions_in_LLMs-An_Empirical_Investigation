The acrid bite of smoke stung Amelia Rose Blackwood’s nostrils even before she rounded the corner onto Maple Street.  Red and orange tongues licked at the sky, devouring the wooden frame house with hungry fervor. Flames danced in the windows, casting grotesque shadows that twisted against the night. A thick, oily black plume rose from the inferno, a monument to destruction visible for miles. 

Amelia, her boots crunching on the gravel driveway, scanned the scene, taking in the panicked faces of onlookers and the frantic activity of her fellow firefighters battling the blaze.  She could hear the hiss of hoses and the clang of metal as they fought to contain the inferno. The air thrummed with a tense, primal energy that always seemed to grip Amelia’s heart like a vise. It was this chaotic ballet of destruction and bravery that she lived for.


This fire, though, felt different. A prickle of unease crawled up her spine as she caught a glimpse of something amidst the chaos - a dark figure disappearing into the inferno.  Her stomach clenched. This wasn't just another call. This was personal.
