The flickering neon sign of the Lucky Dragon diner cast an unsettling glow over Dr. Eleanor Vance's face as she sat hunched in her booth. The air was thick with the scent of stale coffee and greasy bacon, a symphony for the senses that always seemed to linger around cases like this one. It wasn't the smell, though, that gnawed at her, but the silence. A suffocating, absolute silence that permeated the diner even as the clatter of plates and hushed conversations filled the air around her.

Eleanor, a forensic psychologist with a reputation for getting inside the minds of the most twisted individuals, had been called in to consult on the case of David Miller, a man accused of brutally murdering his wife, Brenda, in their seemingly idyllic suburban home. The police had found no sign of forced entry, no obvious motive, and David himself seemed utterly devoid of remorse. He sat silently across from her now, a blank slate with eyes that held nothing but an unsettling emptiness.

The diner, nestled on the outskirts of Maple Creek, was a familiar haunt for Eleanor during cases like this. It provided a strange kind of anonymity, a world away from the sterile confines of the courtroom and the prying eyes of the media. But tonight, even the mundane chatter and clinking silverware couldn't drown out the feeling that something was profoundly wrong.  This case, she knew, wasn't going to be about finding the obvious answers. It was about peeling back layers of deception and confronting a darkness that threatened to consume them all.
