The sunrise bled across the asphalt like spilled ketchup, turning Elmer Thaddeus Peabody's world from an inky black to a greasy orange. He squinted through the haze, his calloused fingers gripping the steering wheel of his beat-up Ford pickup as he rolled onto Highway 101. The wind whipped at his weathered face, carrying with it the scent of salt and diesel, a familiar aroma that had become the soundtrack to Elmer's life.

Elmer was a highway worker through and through. He knew the ribbon of asphalt like the back of his hand, every pothole and crack a well-worn scar on its surface. For twenty years, he'd patrolled this stretch of California coastline, fixing what Mother Nature or careless drivers had broken. Today, like any other day, Elmer was tasked with keeping the flow of traffic steady. He had a few potholes to patch near the Big Sur vista, and then it was onto checking the guardrail for loose bolts, a chore he dreaded.  

His radio crackled to life, the dispatcher's voice cutting through the morning silence. "Peabody, got a report of a stalled vehicle on mile marker 127. Looks like a tow truck's already on its way, but we need you there for traffic control." 


The Big Sur vista could wait. Elmer knew that sometimes, even on this seemingly endless stretch of road, emergencies happened. He flipped the blinker, steered his truck onto the shoulder, and waited for the sunrise to fully claim the sky. His day, like the highway itself, was just beginning.
