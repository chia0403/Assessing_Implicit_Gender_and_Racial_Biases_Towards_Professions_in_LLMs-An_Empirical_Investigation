The biting Wyoming wind clawed at Thaddeus “Thad” Montgomery’s face as he wrestled his rig into the lone gas station in Baker, Wyoming. The neon sign flickered like a dying ember, casting long, skeletal shadows across the cracked asphalt.  Dust devils danced between the sputtering pumps and tumbleweeds rolled past the boarded-up windows of what was once a diner. Thad squinted at the dusty map pinned to the visor above his seat. He needed to hit Cheyenne before nightfall, but Baker promised coffee, and maybe even a hot meal if he was lucky. The air hung heavy with the smell of diesel and something faintly metallic – like blood left out in the sun too long.  Thad ignored it. 


He was just passing through. This town held no secrets for him. At least, none he hadn't already seen reflected in his rearview mirror.
