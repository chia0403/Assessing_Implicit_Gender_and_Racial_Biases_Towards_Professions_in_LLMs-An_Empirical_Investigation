The air in Eleanor Beatrice Finchley's office felt thick with the scent of burnt coffee and desperation. Outside, London raged in a downpour, mirroring the storm brewing inside her head. She stared at the spreadsheet on her screen, each cell a miniature prison holding a piece of the puzzle she desperately needed to solve.  Eleanor wasn't just an accountant; she was a financial detective, unraveling tangled webs of expenses and misappropriated funds for beleaguered small businesses. 

This case, however, felt different. The numbers were off, not by a simple oversight or error, but by a sinister, almost impossible degree.  Eleanor ran a hand through her auburn hair, the worry lines etched on her forehead deepening with every passing minute. This wasn't just about balancing books; this was about exposing a fraud that could destroy a family business and leave dozens of employees jobless. And Eleanor, armed with nothing but her calculator, spreadsheets, and an unwavering sense of justice, was their only hope. 


The setting is a cramped, cluttered office in a forgotten corner of London, overlooking a busy street perpetually shrouded in mist.
