The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Finch's head, casting a sterile glow over the rows of pill bottles that lined her shelves. The air hung heavy with the scent of cough syrup and disinfectant, a familiar perfume in her tiny corner pharmacy tucked away on a side street in Portland, Oregon. Outside, the first blush of dawn painted the sky with streaks of pale pink and orange, but inside Finch's Apothecary, it was always dusk - a quiet haven from the city's relentless morning rush.

Amelia ran a hand through her short, salt-and-pepper hair, sighing as she glanced at the clock. 6:45 am. Just another day in paradise, she thought wryly, wiping down the counter with a damp rag.  It wasn't always this quiet. Back when Finch's was her grandfather's legacy, bustling with regulars and laughter, it had felt like a real community hub. Now, most people just scurried past, their eyes glued to their phones, oblivious to the little shop tucked between a vintage clothing store and a bakery.


But Amelia wasn't complaining. She loved the solitude, the rhythm of her day dictated by the quiet clinking of bottles and the occasional gentle chime of the bell above the door.  She found solace in the precise measurements, the careful compounding, the intimate knowledge of each ingredient and its effect on the body. 

At least, until that was interrupted by a jarring BANG from inside the back room...
