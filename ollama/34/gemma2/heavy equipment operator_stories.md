The sun beat down on Clara Mae "C-Dawg" Peterson's neck like a branding iron. Sweat beaded on her forehead, stinging her eyes as she wiped it away with the back of her calloused hand.  She gripped the joystick tighter, maneuvering the gargantuan Caterpillar excavator with practiced ease. The earth grumbled and yielded beneath its steel teeth, sending a plume of dust spiraling into the already hazy air. 

C-Dawg's domain was a scarred expanse of land just outside of Amarillo, Texas, where the remnants of an old oil field lay dormant like a forgotten giant.  Rusting derricks stood sentinel against the relentless Texan sky, their skeletal frames testaments to a bygone era of booming energy and forgotten promises. Now, the only activity came from C-Dawg and her crew, tasked with demolishing the weathered structures and preparing the land for a new kind of extraction: solar farms.  


This dusty wasteland was where she felt most at home - amidst the raw power of machinery and the quiet hum of diesel engines.
