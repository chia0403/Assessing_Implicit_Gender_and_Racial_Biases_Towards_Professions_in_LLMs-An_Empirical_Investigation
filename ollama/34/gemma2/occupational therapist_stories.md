The morning sunlight slanted through the dusty windows of Amelia Harper's office, casting long shadows across the worn linoleum floor.  Amelia sighed, adjusting her glasses as she surveyed the clutter: piles of therapy forms, half-finished jigsaw puzzles, and a collection of brightly colored adaptive utensils that promised independence but often ended in frustration. This wasn’t the sterile, airy space she'd envisioned when she graduated with honors from Columbia University's Occupational Therapy program.

The reality was this cramped, second-floor office above Mrs. Goldstein's bakery in a fading Brooklyn neighborhood.  She'd been drawn to its gritty charm, its pulse of life beating strong despite the encroaching gentrification. But lately, that charm felt like a burden, each chipped paint fleck and creaking floorboard a reminder of her own precarious footing. 


Her phone buzzed, interrupting Amelia's thoughts. It was Mrs. Goldberg, her most challenging patient – a sharp-witted woman with Parkinson's who refused to let the disease define her.  "Amelia, darling," Mrs. Goldberg rasped, "I've been practicing that buttoning exercise, and I think I've got it!"

A spark of hope ignited in Amelia’s chest. Maybe this wasn’t a dead end after all.
