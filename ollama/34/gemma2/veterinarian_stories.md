The air hung heavy with the smell of disinfectant and hay in Dr. Eleanor Grace Finch's small animal clinic. Sunlight streamed through the dusty windows, illuminating motes dancing in the quiet room. Outside, the bustling town of Willow Creek hummed with life, but inside "Finch & Feathers," time seemed to move at a slower, more measured pace.  Eleanor, her auburn hair pulled back into a loose braid, gently palpated the belly of a shivering ginger kitten. Its purr was weak, barely a tremor against her fingertips. 

She sighed, a quiet sound swallowed by the sterile silence. Willow Creek wasn't exactly overflowing with wealth, and many pet owners struggled to afford proper care. Eleanor had always been drawn to the underdog, both in animals and people. This clinic, inherited from her beloved grandmother, was her way of giving back, patching up furry souls and broken hearts one stitched wound at a time.
