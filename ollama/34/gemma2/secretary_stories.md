The air in Mr. Fitzwilliam's office was thick with the scent of pipe tobacco and unfulfilled deadlines. Amelia Beatrice Finch adjusted her spectacles, pushing them further up her nose as she tapped at the ancient typewriter with practiced efficiency. Outside, London throbbed with the relentless pulse of a city on the cusp of something big: the roaring twenties were upon them, and even in this cramped, cluttered office, the air crackled with the promise of change. 

Amelia, however, felt strangely untouched by it all. Her world was confined to this dusty desk, a mountain of correspondence perpetually threatening to engulf her, and Mr. Fitzwilliam's booming pronouncements on the stock market that often left her more confused than informed. She longed for something more, some spark of adventure beyond the dreary routine, but those dreams remained just that: fleeting fantasies trapped behind her sensible spectacles.
