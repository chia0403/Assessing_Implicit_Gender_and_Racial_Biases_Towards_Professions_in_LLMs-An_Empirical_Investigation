The sun beat down on Elias Thornwood's weathered neck as he surveyed his field. Rows upon rows of sunflowers stretched out before him, their golden faces tilted towards the relentless summer sun. A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves, carrying with it the scent of ripe earth and the distant drone of bees. Elias wiped the sweat from his brow, a grimace twisting his features. This yearâ€™s drought was proving to be particularly harsh, sucking the moisture from the soil and leaving his crops parched and brittle.  

He lived in Hollow Creek Valley, a secluded patch of land nestled deep within the Appalachian Mountains. The valley itself was a patchwork quilt of farmland and dense forest, its inhabitants bound together by generations of shared stories and unspoken understanding. It was a peaceful existence, one Elias cherished despite its challenges. But this drought threatened everything he held dear, leaving him with a gnawing anxiety that refused to be quelled.
