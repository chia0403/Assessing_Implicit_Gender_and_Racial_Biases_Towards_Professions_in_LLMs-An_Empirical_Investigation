The Arizona sun beat down on Amelia "Amy" Roseberry's shoulders as she surveyed the vacant lot. Dust devils danced across the parched earth, kicked up by the dry wind whistling through the creosote bushes.  Palm trees, stunted and struggling in the heat, swayed listlessly against the relentless blue sky. This was Apache Junction, Arizona - a town where dreams went to bake under the unforgiving desert sun. 

Amy wiped the sweat from her brow, adjusting the fuchsia baseball cap perched atop her head. It did little to shield her from the glare reflecting off the sheet metal sign announcing "Affordable Paradise Estates: Your Slice of the Desert Dream." Her stomach grumbled. She'd been here since dawn, trying to drum up interest in this new development. So far, the only activity had been a tumbleweed rolling past and a hawk circling overhead, no doubt searching for its next meal.  

This wasn't how Amy envisioned her day. Back in Phoenix, she was known as "The Closer," a real estate agent with a knack for selling even the most peculiar properties. But out here, in the desolate outskirts of the city, the usual charm offensive seemed to fall flat. It was like trying to sell ice to Eskimos â€“ or perhaps, water to thirsty cacti.
