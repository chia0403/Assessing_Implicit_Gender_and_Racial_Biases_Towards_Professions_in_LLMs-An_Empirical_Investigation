The aroma of vanilla buttercream and caramelized sugar hung thick in the air, a sweet fog that clung to Elara Rosalind Beaumont's apron like an invisible second skin.  Her workshop, nestled on a cobbled side street in Edinburgh, was a symphony of pastel hues and swirling patterns: frosting-covered countertops gleamed under warm lamps, shelves overflowed with vibrant sprinkles and delicate piping tips, and the scent of fresh dough mingled with the intoxicating perfume of hundreds of hand-blown sugar flowers. 

Elara loved this chaos, this meticulous madness that defined her life as a cake decorator. She saw magic in every swirl, every perfectly placed petal, every edible masterpiece she crafted.  But today, the usual joy felt muted. Today, Elara felt the weight of an order unlike any she'd ever received before. 


This wasn't just another wedding cake or whimsical birthday treat. This was a legacy, a final farewell, and it rested, in all its fragile grandeur, on her workbench: a towering confection adorned with spun sugar clouds and delicate buttercream angels, meant to be the centerpiece of the late Lord Blackwood's funeral.
