The scent of lemon polish hung heavy in the air, mingling with the faint aroma of Earl Grey tea still warming in the drawing room.  Eleanor Beatrice Thistlewood, her nimble fingers polishing a silver tray to a blinding gleam, hummed softly under her breath. Sunlight streamed through the tall windows of Blackwood Manor, illuminating dust motes dancing in the air and casting long shadows across the Persian rug. Eleanor loved this time of day - the quiet before the family returned from their morning constitutional, leaving her sole mistress of the grand, echoing halls. 

It was a privilege, she often thought, to care for such a home, even if it meant endless polishing and dusting, a never-ending ballet of order in the face of inevitable chaos. But today, something felt different. A subtle shift in the atmosphere, a prickle of unease beneath her usual calm routine.  


Eleanor set down the tray, her gaze lingering on a chipped porcelain doll nestled amongst the potted ferns in the corner. It was always there, seemingly abandoned by a child long gone, its vacant eyes staring out at the world with an unsettling intensity. Today, she swore those eyes seemed to follow her movements, their painted smile appearing more like a smirk.  

Perhaps it was just the lingering scent of lemon polish playing tricks on her senses.
