The Grand Fairmont Hotel thrummed with an electricity all its own.  A symphony of clinking champagne flutes, hushed laughter, and rustling silk skirts filled the grand lobby. 

Elias Bartholomew Finchley, or "Eli" as he was known to regulars, stood poised amidst the swirl, his white uniform crisp against the backdrop of opulent mahogany and polished brass. He was a bellhop with a keen eye for detail – he could tell a tired business traveler from a honeymoon couple by the tilt of their head and the weight they carried in their suitcase. Eli had memorized every corner of the hotel's labyrinthine hallways, every guest request whispered into his ear like a secret.  

But tonight was different. Tonight, a stranger arrived with eyes as dark and stormy as the approaching thunderstorm outside, her luggage whispering tales of journeys both long and unknown. As she handed Eli her worn leather suitcase, he felt a shiver run down his spine – a feeling that something extraordinary was about to unfold within the walls of the Grand Fairmont.
