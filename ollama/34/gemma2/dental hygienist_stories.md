The insistent buzz of the ultrasonic scaler filled Amelia Rose Hawthorne’s ears, its high-pitched whine a familiar soundtrack to her workday. She glanced at the clock – 10:47 am – and winced.  Just over an hour until her lunch break, which she desperately needed after the morning's flurry of patients with stubborn plaque build-up. The dental office was bathed in the sterile, clinical light of midday sun streaming through the window blinds, casting stripes across the beige linoleum floor.

Amelia meticulously scraped a patient’s molar, pausing to check his teeth with her explorer. His breath smelled faintly of last night's steak and cheap beer, a scent that was sadly becoming more common in this part of town. Outside, traffic roared along Elm Street, a constant reminder of the bustling city just beyond the sterile walls of Dr. Miller’s office.  

Amelia longed for the quiet solitude of her own apartment, where she could curl up with a good book and escape the perpetual chorus of coughs and sniffles that accompanied every patient visit. But first, she had to get through Mr. Henderson's bridge cleaning, a notoriously tedious procedure that always seemed to take an eternity.
