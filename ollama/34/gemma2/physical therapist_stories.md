The scent of antiseptic hung heavy in the air, mingled with the faint aroma of lavender hand sanitizer, as Amelia “Amy” Katherine Hawthorne meticulously prepped the treatment table.  Sunlight streamed through the frosted glass window, casting pale stripes across the worn linoleum floor of her small private practice nestled on a quiet side street in Maplewood, New Jersey. 

Amy ran a practiced hand over the soft blue fabric cover, smoothing out any wrinkles. She glanced at the schedule hanging on the wall beside the door: "10:00 - Johnathan Roberts, rotator cuff injury."  

A knot of apprehension tightened in Amy's chest. Johnathan was a local high school football star, recently sidelined with a torn rotator cuff – an injury that could threaten his scholarship prospects and dreams of playing professional football. This wasn't just another patient for her; this was a young man on the brink, burdened by expectations and fear. 


The chime above the door tinkled, announcing Johnathan’s arrival. Amy straightened up, taking a deep breath to steady her nerves.  She knew she couldn't afford to let his anxieties overshadow their session. She had to focus on helping him regain strength, flexibility, and confidence – one carefully calibrated exercise at a time.
