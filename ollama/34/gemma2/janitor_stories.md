The flickering fluorescent lights cast an anemic yellow glow over the vast, echoing expanse of the National Museum of Natural History after hours. It was the kind of silence that felt less peaceful and more ominous, broken only by the rhythmic swish of Elara Bellweather's mop against the polished marble floors. 

Elara, a woman whose life was as ordinary as the starched uniform she wore, had a routine as predictable as the sunrise.  She swept, mopped, dusted, emptied trashcans, and straightened exhibits in this hallowed hall of history, her only companions the taxidermied gazelles gazing vacantly from their glass cases and the hushed whispers of forgotten secrets echoing through the cavernous space. 


Tonight, however, something felt different. The air hung heavier than usual, thick with an unsettling stillness that made the hairs on Elara's neck prickle. It was as if the museum itself were holding its breath, anticipating somethingâ€¦ or someone.
