The fluorescent hum above buzzed like a hive of impatient bees, casting an anemic glow over Amelia Beatrice Thistlewick's tired face.  A crumpled twenty dollar bill stuck stubbornly to her sweaty palm, its faded image of Benjamin Franklin mocking her with promises of wealth she'd never see. Her name tag, emblazoned with the cheerful font "Amelia," seemed to hang crookedly on her chest, a physical manifestation of her mounting frustration. 

She was trapped in the purgatory of Checkers, a discount grocery store that reeked of stale donuts and desperation, its aisles echoing with the dull clang of shopping carts and the muffled sobs of defeated shoppers wrestling with expired coupons.  The air hung thick with the scent of cheap coffee and regret, a fragrance Amelia had come to associate with another Tuesday afternoon spent scanning items, making change, and enduring the endless stream of indifferent humanity that flowed through her register. 


This wasn't how she envisioned her life.
