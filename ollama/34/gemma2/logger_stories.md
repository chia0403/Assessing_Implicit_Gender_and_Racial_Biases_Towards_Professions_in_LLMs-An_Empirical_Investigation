He stood at the edge of the ancient forest, its towering pines reaching towards the bruised sky like arthritic fingers. A chill wind whipped through the branches, rustling their needles into a symphony of whispers that spoke of secrets untold. 

Elias, his weathered face creased with years of sun and toil, ran a calloused hand over the worn leather of his tool belt. The steel glint of his axe head reflected the dying embers of the morning sun, a promise of hard work ahead. He was a man of few words, comfortable in the company of towering trees more than boisterous men, yet today, a strange unease gnawed at him. 


This wasn't just another day on the job.  A new logging company had arrived, promising efficiency and progress, their sleek machinery a stark contrast to Elias's trusty tools. Their arrival had brought whispers of change, rumors of untouched groves being felled, of ancient paths being paved over with concrete. It was a shift that felt like a tremor in the earth beneath his feet, threatening to upend his entire world.
