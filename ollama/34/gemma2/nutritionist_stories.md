The aroma of burnt toast mingled with the faint scent of lavender hand soap, a peculiar combination that permeated Dr. Eleanor Vance's small consulting room. Outside, a relentless July sun beat down on the cobblestone streets of Florence, Italy, casting long shadows from the ancient buildings lining the Arno River. Inside, however, Eleanor found solace in the cool, dimly lit space, a sanctuary from the bustling city and its ever-present tourists.  

She adjusted her tortoiseshell glasses, peering over the worn copy of "The Complete Guide to Mediterranean Cuisine" resting on her desk. The book, a gift from her grandmother who had instilled in her a love for both food and healing, seemed ironically out of place amidst the clutter of pamphlets advertising gluten-free pasta and vegan gelato that adorned the walls.  

Eleanor sighed. Today was proving to be another typical day for a nutritionist in Italy â€“ juggling the expectations of ancient traditions with the modern obsession for "healthy" living. And she couldn't help but feel a twinge of sympathy for her next appointment, an American tourist who wanted to lose weight while still indulging in all the local delicacies.
