The rain lashed against the grimy windows of the precinct, each drop like a tiny hammer blow against the already frayed nerves of Officer Amelia "Amy" Grace. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor on the worn linoleum floor and the faces huddled around the dispatch table.  

It was 3:17 am, which meant two things: one, nobody in their right mind was out on the streets, and two, whatever was about to come over the radio would be bad news. Amy took a swig of lukewarm coffee, hoping it might drown out the gnawing anxiety that had become a constant companion since she joined the force five years ago. 

The city of Havenwood wasn't exactly known for its glamorous crime sprees. Most days were spent dealing with petty theft, drunk-and-disorderlies, and the occasional domestic dispute. But tonight felt different. The air crackled with an unspoken tension, a feeling that something sinister was brewing just beneath the surface.
