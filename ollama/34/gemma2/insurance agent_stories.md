The humid August air hung heavy in Amelia Rose Hawthorne's office, clinging to her like a damp towel. She wiped at her forehead with a tissue, leaving behind a streak of sweat that mirrored the lines etched onto her face from years spent navigating the treacherous waters of insurance claims. Her beige cubicle, nestled within the sprawling confines of Allstate's midtown branch, offered little respite from the heat. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow glow on the stack of files threatening to engulf her desk. 

Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear.  Another day, another deluge of claims. Her phone buzzed, jolting her back to reality. It was Mrs. Peterson, calling about yet another leaky roof. Amelia knew this call would be just like the hundred before it: a desperate plea laced with frustration and tinged with the ever-present threat of litigation. 


But then, the phone rang again. This time, the caller ID flashed an unfamiliar number. Amelia hesitated, her fingers hovering over the button.  An unexpected call always held the potential for somethingâ€¦different. Was this the day she finally got that elusive raise? Or perhaps a chance to move out of claims and into something more fulfilling?

She took a deep breath and answered. 
"Allstate, Amelia Hawthorne speaking."
