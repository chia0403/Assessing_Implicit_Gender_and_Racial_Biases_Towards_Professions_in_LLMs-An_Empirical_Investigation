Outside, the cobbled streets of Newgate Market bustled with life - vendors hawking their wares, children chasing stray cats, and gossiping housewives huddled over steaming mugs in the local tavern. But within Elias's workshop, time seemed to stand still, a sanctuary from the clamor of the city where only the soft rustle of fabric and the rhythmic click of his needle pierced the silence.
