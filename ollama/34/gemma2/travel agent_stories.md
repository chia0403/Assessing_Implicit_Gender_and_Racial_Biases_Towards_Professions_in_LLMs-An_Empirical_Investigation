The air in Amelia "Amy" Beatrice Hawthorne's office was thick with the scent of lavender hand sanitizer and desperation.  She stared at the pile of brochures threatening to engulf her desk â€“ each one showcasing a sun-drenched paradise she couldn't even afford to dream of right now. The city outside, nestled between towering skyscrapers that cast long shadows across the bustling street below, was as far from a tropical escape as you could get. Rain hammered against the windowpanes, mimicking the relentless drumbeat of clients' anxious demands for a vacation they might never take. 

Amy, however, wasn't ready to surrender.  Her passport had more stamps than her bank account had dollars, and she knew, with every fiber of her travel-loving being, that there was still magic out there waiting to be discovered, even if it was tucked away in a forgotten corner of the world, just beyond reach.
