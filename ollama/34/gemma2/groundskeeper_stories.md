The morning mist clung to Bartholomew "Bart" Thistlewick's weathered boots as he pushed his rusty wheelbarrow through the labyrinthine pathways of Blackwood Manor's sprawling gardens. Dewdrops glistened on spiderwebs spun between the gnarled branches of ancient oaks, each one reflecting a sliver of the pale sunrise bleeding over the horizon. The air, still cool from the night, carried the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, a familiar perfume to Bart after twenty years tending these grounds. 

Blackwood Manor itself loomed above him, an imposing edifice of dark grey stone, its windows like vacant eyes staring out across the manicured lawns. It had been silent for decades, ever since the last Thistlewick heir died tragically young, leaving behind only whispers and legends about the family's cursed lineage.  Bart, a distant relative by marriage, was the last remaining link to the manor's past, entrusted with its upkeep even as it slowly crumbled around him.
