The air in the ER was thick with antiseptic and the cloying scent of fear.  Rain lashed against the windows, mimicking the frantic rhythm of Amelia Grace Bennett's heartbeat. She gripped her stethoscope tighter, its cool metal a grounding anchor amidst the swirling chaos. The doors burst open, ushering in a wailing child clinging to his mother, his face streaked with tears and dirt. 

Amelia moved with practiced efficiency, her years of experience honing her ability to assess the situation at a glance.  A twisted ankle, likely from a fall, she surmised. A common occurrence on nights like this, when storms sent people scurrying for cover, children tripping over misplaced toys, and old dogs slipping on slick sidewalks. 

But even in its familiar rhythm, the ER held an unpredictable energy, a constant reminder that behind each cough, each moan, each tearful plea, lay a story waiting to be told. And Amelia, as always, was ready to listen.
