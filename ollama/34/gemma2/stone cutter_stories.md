The sun beat down on Alaric Thorne's back as he chiseled away at the marble block, sweat stinging his eyes. Dust motes danced in the shaft of light piercing the dusty workshop, illuminating the intricate patterns etched into the stone. The air hung thick with the scent of rasping metal and damp earth, a familiar perfume to Alaric after years spent hunched over his anvil. Outside, the bustling port city of Havenfall hummed with life - merchants haggling, children chasing stray cats, and ships groaning under the weight of exotic goods. But inside Alaric's workshop, time moved differently. Every clang of hammer against stone, every rasp of chisel against surface, was a measured beat in the silent symphony of creation.

Alaric wasn't just any stone cutter. He was known throughout Havenfall for his artistry, his ability to coax beauty and meaning from the cold, unyielding stone. His sculptures were whispered about in hushed tones, their intricate details said to hold echoes of forgotten dreams and ancient magic. 


Today, however, Alaric wasn't working on a commission. Instead, he was lost in his own thoughts, his hammer faltering as he stared at the blank marble block before him.  A strange sense of urgency gnawed at him, a feeling that something momentous was about to happen, something that would irrevocably change his life. He couldn't quite place it, but the premonition hung heavy in the air, as tangible as the dust swirling around his feet.
