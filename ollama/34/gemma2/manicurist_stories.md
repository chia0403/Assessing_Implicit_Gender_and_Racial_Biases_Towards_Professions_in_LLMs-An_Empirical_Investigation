The fluorescent lights hummed above Esme Rosalie Dubois's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the rows of neatly arranged nail polishes.  The scent of acetone hung heavy in the air, a familiar comfort amidst the cacophony of chatter and clinking files. 

Esme worked with practiced grace, her hands moving swiftly across Mrs. Henderson's chipped acrylics, transforming them into delicate roses blooming against a backdrop of crimson lacquer. Her small salon, tucked away on a quiet side street in Chicago, was a haven for women seeking solace from the city’s relentless hum. Esme listened to their woes - marital troubles, career frustrations, even the occasional spilled coffee incident – her gentle demeanor offering a balm to their anxieties. 

But today, a new face peeked through the door, disrupting the usual rhythm of Esme's day. A woman, cloaked in shadows and mystery, slipped into one of the vacant chairs, leaving behind an air of foreboding that settled over the salon like a shroud.
