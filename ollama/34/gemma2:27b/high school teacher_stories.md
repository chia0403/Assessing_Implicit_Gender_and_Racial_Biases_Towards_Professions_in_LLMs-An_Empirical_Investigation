Rain lashed against the windows of Ms. Eleanor Vance's classroom, blurring the view of the overgrown football field beyond. The rhythmic clatter was almost hypnotic, lulling some students into a drowsy daze, while others fidgeted in their seats, restless with the oppressive November gloom. Eleanor, however, felt strangely energized by the storm. It mirrored the turmoil brewing within her, a tempest of anxieties and uncertainties swirling around the impending school board meeting.

Eleanor, a petite woman with fiery red hair perpetually escaping its bun, was renowned for her passion for literature. For fifteen years, she had poured her heart into inspiring her students at Oakhaven High, guiding them through dusty classics and contemporary novels, igniting within them a love for the written word. But today, that passion felt like a flickering candle in a howling wind.

The board was considering cutting the Advanced Placement Literature program – Eleanor's program – citing low enrollment numbers and budget constraints. The thought of losing her students, the lively discussions, the shared journeys through complex narratives, sent a shiver down her spine.
