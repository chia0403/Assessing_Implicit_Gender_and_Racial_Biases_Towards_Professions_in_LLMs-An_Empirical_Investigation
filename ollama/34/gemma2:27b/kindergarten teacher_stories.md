The late afternoon sun streamed through the oversized windows of Ms. Eloise Penelope Cartwright's kindergarten classroom, casting long shadows from the colorful alphabet blocks scattered across the rug.  Crayon scribbles adorned every surface, testament to the day's artistic endeavors. Outside, the faint scent of rain hung in the air, promising a refreshing break from the uncharacteristic summer heat that had been blanketing Harmony Creek for weeks. Eloise sighed contentedly, gathering up the last of the finger-painted butterflies. 

Despite the chaos inherent in wrangling twenty five-year-olds, she wouldn't trade her job for anything. There was something undeniably magical about witnessing the world unfold anew through the wide, curious eyes of her students. Today, they had learned about metamorphosis, and Eloise had been particularly impressed by little Timmy Jackson's insightful observation that caterpillars were "just butterflies wearing pajamas."
