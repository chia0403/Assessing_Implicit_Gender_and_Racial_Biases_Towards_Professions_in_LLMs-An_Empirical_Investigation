The fluorescent lights hummed above Amelia Beatrice Cartwright's head, casting a sickly yellow glow over the stainless steel instruments laid out on her tray like surgical tools awaiting their victim.  Amelia hated this part of the day – the pre-patient ritual. It felt sterile and impersonal, a far cry from the genuine connections she craved to forge with her patients.

Today's patient was scheduled for 9:00 AM sharp. Amelia glanced at the clock on the wall. 8:58 AM.  She smoothed down her crisp blue scrubs, taking a deep breath and hoping today wouldn't be another barrage of teeth stained by black coffee and neglect. She longed for something different – perhaps a patient who appreciated the artistry of dental hygiene, who understood that behind the probing and scraping lay a desire to preserve not just their teeth, but their overall health and wellbeing.

Her practice, "Sunshine Smiles" in the bustling heart of downtown Denver, was known for its cheerful decor and friendly staff. Yet, Amelia often felt like a cog in a machine, tirelessly cleaning and polishing smiles that rarely met her gaze.  She dreamt of something more fulfilling, a way to use her skills beyond the confines of this sterile room.
