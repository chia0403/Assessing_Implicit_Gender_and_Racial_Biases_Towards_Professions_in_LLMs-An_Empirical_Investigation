The first tendrils of dawn were just beginning to peek over the manicured hedges when Alistair Hawthorne shuffled out of his cluttered shed, the scent of damp earth and freshly cut grass already clinging to his worn overalls. He stretched, his joints popping in protest after a night spent curled up on the rickety cot in the corner, and surveyed the sprawling estate before him.

Oakhaven Manor was a relic of a bygone era, a majestic Victorian mansion surrounded by acres of meticulously sculpted gardens. Alistair had been its caretaker for over twenty years, his weathered hands tending to every rosebush, every fountain, every inch of emerald lawn with an almost religious devotion. It was more than just a job; it was a sanctuary, a refuge from the world that lay beyond the wrought iron gates.

Today, however, a disquieting sense of unease hung in the air. The usual symphony of birdsong seemed muted, replaced by an unsettling silence broken only by the distant rustling of leaves. Alistair felt a prickle on the back of his neck as he noticed something amiss: the usually vibrant rose garden, Alistair's pride and joy, was draped in an unnatural gloom.  The dew-kissed petals were wilted, their fiery crimson dulled to a sickly gray. And nestled amongst the withered blooms lay something that sent a shiver down his spine - a single, perfect black rose.
