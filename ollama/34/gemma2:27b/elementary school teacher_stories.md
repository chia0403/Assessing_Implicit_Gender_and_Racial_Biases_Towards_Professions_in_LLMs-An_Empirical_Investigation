Rain lashed against the windows of Mrs. Eleanor Winthrop's third-grade classroom, mimicking the chaotic symphony brewing in her chest.  Crayola crayon shards littered the floor like fallen autumn leaves, testament to a particularly disastrous art project involving papier-mâché volcanoes and hastily mixed tempera paint. The air hung heavy with the cloying scent of Elmer's glue and frustrated sighs.

Eleanor sank into her worn, green swivel chair, momentarily burying her face in her hands. It wasn’t the volcanic eruption gone awry that bothered her most – though it certainly wasn't helping.  It was the impending parent-teacher conference with Mr. and Mrs. Harrison regarding their son, Tommy. Tommy, with his mischievous grin and boundless energy, was a constant whirlwind of disruption in her classroom. 


Eleanor knew she needed to tread carefully. She wanted the Harrisons to understand that while Tommy posed challenges, he also possessed a spark of creativity and intelligence that shone through occasionally. The key was to find a way to nurture that spark without extinguishing it entirely.
