The stale air of Ms. Eloise Hawthorne’s office clung to her like a second skin. It smelled faintly of cinnamon-apple hand sanitizer and years of teenage angst. Sunlight slanting through the grimy window painted stripes across the worn carpet, highlighting the faded motivational posters on the wall: “Believe in Yourself,” “Reach for the Stars.” Eloise found them laughably outdated, relics from a time when ambition seemed attainable and the future wasn't an ever-looming, existential dread. 

She glanced at the clock – 2:47 pm. Only thirteen minutes until the bell rang, releasing her students back into the whirlwind of adolescence. Eloise sighed. Today had been another string of college applications, relationship drama, and existential crises masquerading as questions about career paths.  Her own path, once filled with dreams of helping young minds blossom, now felt more like a dusty road leading nowhere in particular.
