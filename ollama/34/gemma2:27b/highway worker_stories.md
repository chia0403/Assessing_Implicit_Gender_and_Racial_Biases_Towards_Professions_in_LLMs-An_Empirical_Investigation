The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Thornton's back like a blacksmith's hammer. Sweat stung his eyes, blurring the already shimmering asphalt before him.  He squinted, adjusting the brim of his faded blue cap as the rumble of an 18-wheeler vibrated through the ground and up his legs. Eli grimaced; another close call. Drivers on Highway 57 rarely slowed for the "Road Work Ahead" signs, treating the orange cones like mere suggestions.

Eli was part of a two-man crew tasked with patching a particularly gnarly section of the highway â€“ a testament to years of heavy traffic and unforgiving desert heat. His partner, old man Pete, grumbled as he wrestled a jackhammer into submission, muttering something about "city slickers" and "no respect for honest work."

Eli understood his frustration. They were invisible men out here, overlooked and underestimated, just cogs in the machine of keeping this desolate stretch of road navigable.  But Eli took pride in his work. Every patch of asphalt he smoothed was a victory against entropy, a small but significant contribution to the world hurtling by at 70 miles per hour.

Today, however, something felt different. The air hung heavy with an almost palpable tension. A shiver ran down Eli's spine despite the relentless sun. He couldn't shake the feeling that they weren't alone out here in the vast, unforgiving expanse of the Mojave Desert.
