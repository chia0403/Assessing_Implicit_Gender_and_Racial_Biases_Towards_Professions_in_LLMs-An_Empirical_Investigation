The humid air hung heavy in Amelia Cartwright's tiny office, thick with the scent of jasmine from the diffuser she constantly refilled, trying to mask the stale smell of old paper and forgotten dreams. Outside, Bangkok throbbed: tuk-tuks honked, street vendors hawked their wares, and the relentless sun beat down on the crowded streets. Amelia, however, was lost in a world of snow-capped peaks and shimmering turquoise lakes. Spread across her desk lay brochures for Switzerland, each image more idyllic than the last. 

She ran a hand through her unruly auburn curls, sighing. "Switzerland," she murmured, tracing the outline of the Matterhorn with her fingertip. It was the kind of place she longed to see, but instead, she spent her days helping others escape the mundane reality of Bangkok for their own dream destinations.  


Amelia Cartwright wasn't just any travel agent; she possessed a rare gift - an uncanny ability to understand what each client truly desired, even if they couldn't articulate it themselves. Yet, despite crafting unforgettable journeys for countless others, Amelia felt trapped in her own life, yearning for an adventure of her own.
