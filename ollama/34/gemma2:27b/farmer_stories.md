The wind whipped across the endless expanse of wheat, its dry, rustling song a familiar lullaby to Elias Bartholomew. For generations, his family had tilled this land, coaxing life from the stubborn soil, their sweat and toil etched into the very furrows.  Elias, with sun-weathered hands and eyes the color of a storm-ridden sky, surveyed his domain from atop the weathered fence post. The golden stalks swayed like a sea beneath him, stretching towards the horizon where the bruised purple clouds promised an early autumn storm. 

But today, Elias's heart wasn't filled with the usual contentment of a harvest nearing. A gnawing unease twisted in his gut, fueled by whispers travelling on the wind - whispers of blight, of crops failing, of something unnatural stirring in the shadows beyond the fields.
