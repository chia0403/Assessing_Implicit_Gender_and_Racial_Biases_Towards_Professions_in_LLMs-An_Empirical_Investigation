The midday sun beat down on Elias "Eli" Blackwood's shoulders as he wrestled with a stubborn bundle of shingles. Sweat beaded on his brow, tracing greasy trails through the dust caking his skin. Below him, the city sprawled like a patchwork quilt â€“ red brick houses stitched together with asphalt streets and green patches of parkland. He could hear the distant wail of sirens and the rhythmic hammering of construction crews, all weaving together into the symphony of urban life. 

Eli gripped the shingle tighter, gritting his teeth against the sudden gust of wind that threatened to tear it from his grasp.  He balanced precariously on the steep roof edge, squinting at the horizon where a storm cloud was gathering, dark and ominous. He needed to finish this section before the rain hit.
