The fluorescent lights of the counselor’s office buzzed overhead like agitated wasps, casting a sterile glow over Dr. Eleanor Vance's cluttered desk. Papers overflowed from overflowing trays, threatening to engulf her stapler and half-eaten apple. Outside her window, the manicured lawns of Willow Creek Elementary School shimmered in the late afternoon sun, a deceptive tableau of childhood innocence. Inside, however, Eleanor was grappling with something far darker: the case of ten-year-old Liam Henderson, who'd been drawing disturbing images filled with fire and shadowy figures.

Eleanor tapped her pen against her chin, her brow furrowed with concern. Liam’s drawings weren't just childish scribbles; they were detailed, unsettlingly realistic depictions of violence and destruction. He claimed he saw these things in his dreams, vivid nightmares that left him trembling and silent for hours after waking. Eleanor had tried traditional methods - play therapy, art therapy - but nothing seemed to penetrate Liam’s icy fear. Today felt different, though. Liam wasn't just drawing the nightmares anymore; he was writing cryptic messages beside them, messages Eleanor couldn't decipher.
