The air hung heavy with the scent of turpentine and lavender, a familiar cocktail in Eliza Blackwood's cramped studio apartment. Sunlight slanted through the grimy windowpane, illuminating dust motes dancing in its path and casting long shadows from the cluttered easel holding her latest work-in-progress. A canvas depicting a swirling nebula of vibrant blues, purples, and oranges stared back at her, its incomplete state mirroring the turmoil brewing within Eliza herself.  

She dabbed at a rogue smudge of cobalt blue on her nose with a paint-stained rag, sighing deeply. The deadline for the gallery exhibition loomed like a hungry beast, threatening to consume her. Inspiration, that fickle muse, had abandoned her, leaving behind only a hollow ache and the persistent clattering of doubt in her mind.  Eliza needed a spark, something to ignite the fire within her artistic soul. But where could she possibly find it?
