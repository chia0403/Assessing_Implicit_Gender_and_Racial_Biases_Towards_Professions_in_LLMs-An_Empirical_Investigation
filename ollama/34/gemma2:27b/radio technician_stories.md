The air in El Paso crackled with heat, even at dusk. Dust devils danced across the cracked asphalt of the parking lot outside KTEX Radio, kicking up swirls of red earth that clung to Esmeralda Dominguez's grease-stained overalls. Inside the dimly lit studio, tubes glowed an angry orange, their hum a constant counterpoint to the tinny strains of "Blue Suede Shoes" playing on repeat.

Esmeralda sighed, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. Fixing the transmitter was proving to be a real pain in the antenna.  Ever since the monsoon season rolled through last month, it had been acting up â€“ sputtering static bursts between songs and cutting out entirely during crucial news bulletins.

She tightened a screw on the behemoth machine, her brow furrowed in concentration. As KTEX's only radio technician, she was responsible for keeping the station alive, broadcasting music and local news to the dusty towns spread across West Texas. It wasn't glamorous work, but Esmeralda took pride in knowing that her efforts brought a little bit of joy and connection to people scattered across the vast landscape.

Suddenly, a sharp crackle erupted from the speaker, followed by an earsplitting screech. The smell of burning ozone filled the air. Esmeralda winced, instinctively reaching for the emergency shut-off. Something had gone seriously wrong this time.
