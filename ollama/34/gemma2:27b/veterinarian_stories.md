The air hung heavy with the scent of antiseptic and fear. Rain lashed against the windows of the "Critter Clinic," blurring the neon sign that flickered valiantly against the storm. Inside, Dr. Eloise Beaumont wrestled with a writhing mass of fur and fangs. A ginger tomcat, aptly named Lucifer by his exasperated owner, was vehemently opposed to having his paw examined.

"Easy there, Lucifer," Eloise soothed, her voice calm despite the fact that she'd already sustained two scratches. "Just a little prick for the vaccination." She glanced up at the worried face peering over the examination table. Mrs. Henderson, a frail woman with kind eyes and a tremor in her hands, wrung them together nervously. 

The clinic itself was a cozy haven, tucked away on a cobblestone street in the heart of Willow Creek. Wooden beams crisscrossed the ceiling, and shelves overflowed with jars containing preserved specimens and antique veterinary instruments. But tonight, the usual comforting atmosphere felt strained, overshadowed by the ominous rumble of thunder outside. Eloise had a feeling this was just the beginning of a long, stormy night.
