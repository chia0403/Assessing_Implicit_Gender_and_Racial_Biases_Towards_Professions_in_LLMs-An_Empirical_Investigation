Rain lashed against the windowpanes of "Tranquil Touch," its insistent rhythm mirroring Elara Solstice's pounding heart.  She stood in her dimly lit treatment room, the scent of lavender oil mingling with the faint aroma of ozone from the storm brewing outside.

Elara was no stranger to anxiety. It came with the territory of being an empath, a massage therapist who felt her clients' emotions as keenly as they did. But tonight, something felt different. A prickling unease spread through her, intensified by the howling wind and flickering lights.  She glanced at the clock: 8:57 pm. Her last appointment was due any minute.

The heavy oak door creaked open, revealing a silhouette backlit by the streetlamp's hazy glow. Elara straightened, forcing a smile as she saw her client step inside, his features obscured by the shadows. "Welcome," she said softly, extending her hand in greeting.


As he stepped closer, a shiver ran down Elara's spine. This wasn't just anxiety; it was something primal, a deep-seated fear that whispered warnings she couldn't ignore.  The man's eyes, dark and intense, met hers for a moment before a chilling smile spread across his lips.

"Elara Solstice," he said, his voice a low rumble that seemed to vibrate through the room. "I believe we have much to discuss."
