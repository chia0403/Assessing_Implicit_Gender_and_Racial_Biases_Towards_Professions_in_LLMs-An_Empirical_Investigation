Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Detective Isabella “Izzy” Diaz’s office, blurring the already dismal view of the alleyway below. The flickering fluorescent lights hummed an incessant tune, punctuated by the clattering rhythm of Izzy’s fingers against her keyboard. A half-eaten donut sat on a stack of case files beside her, its glazed surface mirroring the desolate cityscape reflected in her weary eyes.

It was past midnight, and the precinct felt eerily deserted. The only other sign of life came from the rhythmic thumping emanating from the interrogation room next door. Izzy sighed, rubbing the sleep out of her eyes. Another night, another unsolved case. This one – the brutal murder of a young socialite – had been plaguing her for weeks. The victim, Veronica Thorne, was found strangled in her opulent penthouse apartment, with no sign of forced entry and a single playing card tucked into her lifeless hand: the Queen of Spades.

Izzy leaned back in her creaky chair, staring at the ceiling. Something about the case felt off, like a jigsaw puzzle missing its crucial pieces. The lack of motive, the cryptic clue, the eerie sense of familiarity she couldn't quite place… it all gnawed at her intuition.  As if summoned by her thoughts, a sharp rapping on her door startled her out of her reverie.

“Come in,” Izzy called, her voice raspy from disuse.
