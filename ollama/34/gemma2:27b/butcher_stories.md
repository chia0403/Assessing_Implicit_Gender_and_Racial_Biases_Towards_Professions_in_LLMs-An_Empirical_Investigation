The air hung heavy with the metallic tang of blood and the sweet, earthy aroma of sawdust.  Sunlight, pale and filtered through the grime-coated windows of Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins's shop, illuminated dust motes dancing in the stillness. Bart, a man built like an oak tree with forearms thicker than most men's thighs, stood behind his counter, meticulously sharpening a cleaver on a whetstone. His face, weathered and crisscrossed with wrinkles, held a concentration so deep it seemed to carve new lines into his skin. Outside, the cobblestone streets of Butcher's Row buzzed with early morning activity: vendors hawking their wares, children chasing pigeons, the rhythmic clang of a blacksmith's hammer. But within the confines of Bart Higgins's shop, time moved differently, dictated by the slow, deliberate rhythm of his work. 

Today was market day, and the butcher shop would soon be teeming with housewives bartering for cuts of meat, gossiping over slabs of bacon, and scrutinizing the freshness of Bart's sausages. But for now, Bart savored the quiet before the storm, finding solace in the familiar weight of his cleaver and the comforting scent of his craft.
