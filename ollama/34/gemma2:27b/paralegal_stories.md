Rain lashed against the grimy windowpane of Amelia Cartwright's cramped office cubicle. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting a sickly yellow pallor over the stacks of legal documents threatening to engulf her desk.  Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of auburn hair behind her ear and rubbing tired eyes. Another late night at Miller & Sons Law Firm, another mountain of paperwork to sift through before she could finally head home.

She glanced at the clock - 10:37 pm.  This case – the inheritance dispute between the eccentric Vandermeer siblings – was proving more complex than anticipated. Amelia knew she should have left hours ago, but something about the tangled web of wills and counter-claims kept her glued to her chair. Besides, Mr. Miller, a man who valued billable hours above all else, wouldn't be pleased if she clocked out before midnight.

Suddenly, a sharp rapping on the glass door jolted Amelia from her concentration. A tall figure, shrouded in shadows cast by the flickering streetlights outside, stood silhouetted against the rain-streaked pane. Before Amelia could even rise, the figure pushed open the door and stepped inside, bringing with them a blast of cold air and the scent of wet asphalt.
