Rain lashed against the grimy windows of Elias Blackwood's office, blurring the already dismal view of downtown Chicago.  The air inside hung thick with the scent of stale coffee and desperation, a familiar aroma in his line of work. Elias, a man whose face seemed permanently etched with weariness, ran a hand through his thinning hair, pushing back a stray lock that stubbornly flopped onto his forehead. He stared at the file spread across his desk, the words blurring into meaningless squiggles under the harsh glare of the overhead fluorescent light. This case - defending a young woman accused of embezzling millions from her employer â€“ felt different, heavier somehow.  

Perhaps it was the girl's haunted eyes, wide and filled with a fear that pierced through Elias's cynicism. Or maybe it was the nagging feeling in his gut, whispering that this wasn't just another case of greed and ambition. Something wasn't right.
