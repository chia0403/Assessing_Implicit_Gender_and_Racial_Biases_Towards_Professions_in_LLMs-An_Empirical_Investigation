The flickering fluorescent lights hummed in discordant harmony with Amelia Cartwright's pounding headache. Stacks of printouts littered her desk, each page filled with dense code that swam before her tired eyes. Outside, the relentless July sun beat down on Silicon Valley, turning the glass-walled office into a shimmering oven. Amelia sighed, pushing a stray strand of fiery hair from her forehead. 

She was deep in the trenches of Project Phoenix, a complex overhaul of the antiquated billing system for Helios Pharmaceuticals. Weeks of sleepless nights and endless coffee had blurred into a monotonous cycle of debugging and optimization. Today, however, Amelia felt a growing sense of unease. The code wasn't behaving as expected, spitting out bizarre errors that defied logic. 

Something wasn't right.  

Amelia leaned back in her chair, rubbing her temples. A nagging suspicion gnawed at her â€“ this wasn't just a simple bug. It felt like something more sinister was lurking beneath the surface of the code, a hidden anomaly waiting to be unleashed.
