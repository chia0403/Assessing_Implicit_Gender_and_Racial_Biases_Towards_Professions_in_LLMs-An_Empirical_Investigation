Rain lashed against the windowpanes, blurring the already fading autumn sunlight. Eleanor Vance sighed, her reflection wavering in the glass like a ghost. Her office, perched precariously on the edge of the charming but perpetually struggling seaside town of Seahaven, was as gloomy as the weather. Stacks of flyers advertising "charming cottages" and "ocean-view dream homes" mocked her from the corner desk.  Eleanor hadn't closed a deal in weeks.

The rhythmic thud of rain drums echoed through the empty office, punctuated only by the ticking of an antique grandfather clock that Eleanor swore had slowed down with her recent fortunes. Seahaven was beautiful, undeniably so, but its charm seemed lost on potential buyers these days. The once-bustling fishing port now languished under the weight of economic decline, its cobblestone streets echoing with whispers of better times.

Today, however, Eleanor had a glimmer of hope. A call from a mysterious client promised to breathe life back into her weary career. They wanted something unique, something off the beaten path, somethingâ€¦ haunted.  Eleanor's brow furrowed. Haunted? In Seahaven? She wasn't sure whether to be intrigued or terrified.
