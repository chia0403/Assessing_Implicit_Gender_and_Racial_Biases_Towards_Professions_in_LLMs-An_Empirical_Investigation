Rain lashed against the windows of the Sunnyside Rehabilitation Center, blurring the vibrant autumn leaves into streaks of orange and red. Inside, Eleanor Finch adjusted her spectacles and surveyed the chaotic scene in the therapy gym. Balls rolled haphazardly across the floor, a half-deflated exercise ball sat lopsidedly on a bench, and the air buzzed with the sounds of laughter and exertion. 

Eleanor, with her neatly braided silver hair and calm demeanor, was a beacon of order in the storm. For twenty years she had been guiding patients through their journeys back to independence, using creativity and unwavering compassion to help them overcome physical and cognitive challenges. Today, however, she felt a familiar knot of anxiety tightening in her stomach.  A new patient was arriving â€“ a young man with a traumatic brain injury, whose prognosis was uncertain at best.
