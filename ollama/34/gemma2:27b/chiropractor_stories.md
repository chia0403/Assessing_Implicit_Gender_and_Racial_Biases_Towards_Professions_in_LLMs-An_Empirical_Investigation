Rain lashed against the windowpanes of Dr. Evelyn Rose Sinclair's office, mimicking the relentless ache pulsing behind her own left temple.  The flickering neon sign outside read "Sinclair Chiropractic: Straighten Your Spine, Straighten Your Life." It felt ironic tonight. Evelyn sighed, rubbing her temples, wishing she could apply a bit of chiropractic magic to her own pounding headache. 

Her practice was nestled in the heart of Bellhaven, a small coastal town known for its rugged charm and equally rugged residents – lobstermen with perpetually bent backs and surfers perpetually chasing waves (and injuries).  The salty tang of the ocean air always lingered, even inside the cozy waiting room adorned with seashells and nautical charts. 

Tonight, however, the waiting room was empty. The storm had chased away even the most dedicated patients seeking relief from their sciatica or crick in the neck. Evelyn glanced at the clock – 7:15 pm.  She considered packing up, heading home to her cozy cottage overlooking the harbor, and a steaming mug of chamomile tea. But just as she reached for her bag, the door creaked open, admitting a figure shrouded in rain and mystery.
