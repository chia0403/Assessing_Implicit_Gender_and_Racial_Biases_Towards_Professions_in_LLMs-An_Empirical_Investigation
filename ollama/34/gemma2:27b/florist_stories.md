The bell above the shop door chimed with a hesitant sweetness, like a wind chime caught in a gentle breeze. Eloise Beaumont looked up from her arrangement of deep purple lisianthus and fiery orange lilies, her brow furrowed slightly as she surveyed the newcomer. He was tall and broad-shouldered, clad in a worn leather jacket that seemed out of place amongst the delicate fragrance of lilies and roses.  He shuffled awkwardly, his eyes darting around the vibrant chaos of Eloise's flower shop, "Blooming Marvellous." Sunlight streamed through the arched window, illuminating dust motes dancing above bouquets of sunflowers and hydrangeas, while the air hummed with the gentle whir of a ceiling fan.

Eloise smoothed down her floral-print apron, pushing a stray curl behind her ear. "Good morning," she greeted warmly. "Can I help you find something special?"
